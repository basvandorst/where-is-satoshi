What would happen if you showed up to pay for taxes with a bagful of cash? What would the next step be

She could easily have a contract worth say, 25 btc, before real probably would just say $14250 but if to her it's 25 hours of work, say over a month, then she could say she makes a bitcoin an hour.
That being said, I doubt it's legit but who knows

What if you built a full node INTO a video game? 
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:28:02
Never lol

This is so good I rate it 6/10 tinfoils that Trezor was behind the original hack in the first place. Some of the finest guerilla marketing you'll ever see folks
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:40:35
I still think that's doable, I'm not sure I'd say it's likely but the odds are SOME present day Reddit user will live that long. There are certainly some people here by born in this millennium, and the odds of them living to 2150ish seem good to me
@_date: 2016-08-06 02:13:02
It's not 'fair' in any sense of the word. Don't be ridiculous 
@_date: 2016-08-29 01:16:13
Probably not tbh.

..... Do you get your meth from BBMC?
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:57:12
Where is this? Good sign though, mainstream media attention is probably for the best regardless of the news itself
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:55:49
You meant in the last 12 months, I gotcha. Unless I'm remembering it wrong we started 2016 up over $300?

Given that people have already gotten within 20 years, I think modern medicine will take some current readers past it

Well for starters there is one on your phone!

Any alt coin developers whose projects/companies are getting VC money that would otherwise go a to company in the BTC ecosystem
Anyone specific? Not sure if he had a single person in mind, buts it's certainly happening all over the place
@_date: 2016-08-31 03:24:40
Great town
@_date: 2016-04-01 15:43:24
I'm assuming it would be the same. Gwern got the subpoena back last spring right?
@_date: 2016-04-01 17:03:52
In September we were in the low 200's
If you want to make comparisons, they need to be over much longer periods of time
You right about oil though, but that's a commodity and the two things shouldn't really be compared 
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:38:34
But they wouldn't want to know where the cash was from? I guess it'd be next years taxes haha? (I really am asking, I don't know)
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:50:57
Remove my BTC from coinbase before march 21st
Got it!
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:51:08
Wait so what was it?
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:39:33
Many ways to achieve this yes
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:07:02
Multiple. Good luck in your search!
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:39:54
You right i bought a trezor ive just been very lazy
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:50:14
But isn't the creator/inventor/CEO(lol) of ETH also the creator/heavily involved with/has large financial interest in the DAO?
I could be wrong but that was my understanding at least. Not surprised the conflict of interest became an issue if so....
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:42:43
I mean if this happened with a stock I'm pretty sure it would be illegal. I realize there's not a truly comparable situation, and exchanges have shut down before to halt trading, but halting sells of a specific security to prop up the price is very very illegal
@_date: 2016-06-02 16:29:00
Hahaha hey OP better delete this post since you haven't got this guys permission and he isn't being compensated!
@_date: 2016-06-14 23:27:57
Damn. I bought 3.5btc around $580 and will absolutely lose my shit if they cancel if. I was replacing BTC that I was spending, so I'd just be fucked out of the money it'd cost to replace them....
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:45:21
The best takeaway from the whole thing comes shortly afterward "March 2013 was a different time"
You're damn right

What exactly are we meant to see on his LinkedIn page?

Oh it's 100% written off, business expense. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:48:07
Honestly dino came across as a total sociopath. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 15:03:34
Way to go making it sound even more like an infomercial lol
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:43:53
They were just trying to stop the price from collapsing any further. Stopping the hacker was just a charade at that point. Can't believe exchanges even listened to this crap. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 16:10:50
How much is the salary range for the job
@_date: 2016-06-22 03:38:03
I guess the difference being the exchange deciding to do it, vs a stakeholder calling for it?
@_date: 2016-06-18 07:01:16
Well no he sold 25% of his ETH on the last bubble...
@_date: 2017-01-08 03:58:31
... i .... but.... well...
Damn that's a good point
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:23:07
I did acknowledge that in my post, there is a difference however in halting trading for the entire market and backrooming a halt on trading of a specific security
@_date: 2016-11-19 06:19:34
Well considering that you wait 5-7 days to receive your coins... 
@_date: 2016-11-19 06:18:55
Other than their week long time between purchasing and receiving BTC?
That's the ridiculous part. It will impact everyone differently
@_date: 2016-11-19 06:24:50
Well really people should look at their own numbers and decide for themselves. Some people (more than a few) will not be in the black anyway under this accounting, as generally the spreads are tight(ish)
@_date: 2016-11-28 03:11:49
That is awesome! This AMA rocks haha.

People say this all the time but The evidence certainly isn't there. Sure it's happened, but I promise you plenty of people do so with no issues 
Granted, don't do it with 20k
@_date: 2017-04-09 01:13:33
Is that you Quantik?
@_date: 2016-09-06 02:09:23
What if you're just looking for information in general? Is there a place for that? Be it on a person or otherwise. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 10:52:56
I mean my understanding of it is the same as what you've written, but we read the same article and have no other info so I guess it shouldn't be that surprising 
@_date: 2016-09-15 04:16:23
This actually answers several non Bitcoin related issues I've had recently! Thank you!
@_date: 2016-09-25 13:34:27
Lol if anything you'd see spikes on Thursdays/Friday's...

The answer to this question is of great interest to me

Oh shit it's the true OP haha.
Great article

Hahahahaha bustedddd

Wow I ended up reading the whole page. Guess I understand Theymos being a mod a little more now
@_date: 2016-09-15 04:12:39
Sorry the world isn't all like your tiny relatively homogenous Eden... My car is financed at a little under 2.5% and that lets me drive a new car that needs zero maintenance. If I had to buy a car with only money I had? Instead of putting several thousand down I'd have had to buy an old piece of junk and I'd have probably spent an extra thousand fixing it in the first year alone. It would get worse gas mileage as well costing me even more... 
When you're an adult you'll realize that a lot more goes into these decisions than hurr durr borrow money to buy nice stuff I 'can't afford'
It's saving me money? Do older cars in Denmark magically not need more maintenance than new ones? I'd be amazed... I bet you have public transit as well, whereas if I didn't have a car to drive to better jobs, I'd make maybe 50% of what I do at work. 
TLDR it's complicated and your post is ignorant and judgemental as fuck 
Edit: fuck this is on the wrong comment.
@_date: 2016-09-15 05:07:41
Hang on... Who is going to wait 5-15 minutes for a confirmation to get their snack??? That sounds awfully inconvenient to me. You can't tell me you're taking zero confirms for a vending machine lol, unless this vending machine also has KYC you're going to getting double spent on the Daily and how the hell would you ever stop it??
@_date: 2016-09-08 04:22:34
I get it, the /s is for stupid!
@_date: 2016-10-07 21:28:06
Terrible example for several reasons, first and foremost is that bkba is not divisible. Besides which it confers voting rights. Very poor comparison that actually makes the opposite point. 
The entire point of bkbb is to allow investors to buy the same company a lower unit value. It's the same reason companies do stock splits. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:22:48
 Still correct to use EV here, he is correct in saying the EV for this is exponentially worse than even a bad lottery
@_date: 2016-10-04 23:18:51
So it becomes a free vending machine then? Great business model... 
@_date: 2016-05-14 14:46:26
I don't understand the appeal of these, maybe you could explain?
@_date: 2016-05-08 13:16:37

Dude seriously? You felt this necessitated an entire post to complain about? On two different subreddits no less...
The guy called you on your pseudo intellectual spew, and you're upset. Make an educated retort, or move on with your day but please don't feel the need to WHINE

You sound like a normal well adjusted human being
@_date: 2016-07-29 21:20:32
Woah woah woah.... You can totally judge someone on their age. If he isn't 22 then how old is he!? Keep in mind I'm in the 20-25 range and I think it's fucking hilarious he holds this much authority 
@_date: 2016-07-27 08:22:30
There are a fair amount of similarities between the two. Comparable.

You are in fact wrong, die in a car fire please

Over $10k would require a CTR to be filed, a SAR would be for a transaction that appears otherwise suspicious. It could be something that appears to be structuring, it could be because they have reason to believe the money is the result of a criminal enterprise, it could be because they asked too many questions about reporting requirements, it could be because they refused to show ID when asked, or because they believe the transaction might be connected to a country that the US has embargoed eg. Iran
@_date: 2016-07-27 08:23:39
Ugh fuck ok what do I do? I have small stash of BTC but I leave it sitting in coin base wallet.... 
@_date: 2016-07-27 06:12:44
Well call up the ceo of Bitcoin and tell him your thoughts! Surely he can require it then no? Perhaps a strongly worded letter would be appropriate 
@_date: 2016-07-03 06:03:06
Uh... Lol.
But I fucking hope you're right haha
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:19:27
I'd find a big firm that will have tax attorneys as well as criminal defense and a solid referral to a CFP. Spend a little bit of your hoard and you will legally unlock the rest of it.
@_date: 2016-07-27 08:19:10
So anyone who doesn't know to do a split transaction will effectively be giving away their ETC if they attempt to send ETH to their account? I'm genuinely asking, I don't know a whole lot about this situation but this seems like what is happening here
