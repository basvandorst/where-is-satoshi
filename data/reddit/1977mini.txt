Those have all been centralized projects if I'm not mistaken. I'd also say the level of investment you speak of is very minimal. If you asked myspace users whether they'd rather pay over a thousand dollars if it meant their friends all continued to use MySpace instead of Facebook or if they'd rather pay nothing and switch to Facebook I suspect most people would go for the latter. Making a MySpace profile, uploading some photos and adding some people is not exactly hard.

Indeed, I can see what you're saying and I do agree, although I think that rests on Bitcoin not evolving and keeping up. People from the altcoin camps and others like to paint Bitcoin as this stagnant unevolving dinosaur but it's far from the reality, these developers and researchers are on the cutting edge, but they also need to take further safety measures because they don't have the luxury of a small userbase like the altcoins do. It's a big problem if they push out buggy code and put 200 billion dollars of market cap at risk, but your 500mil altcoin can afford to take a lot more risk. Another thing that needs to be considered is that all of the altcoins on the market would have similar scaling issues if they hit the level of adoption Bitcoin has had. Take a look at Ethereum for example, it can't even handle a single virtual kitten dApp, and the Ethereum maximalists like to pretend Ethereum is going to kill Bitcoin at it's own game. Ain't going to happen.

I doubt the price will give a fuck about such an insignificant hack. It's nothing compared to past hacks that haven't affected price. Besides, everyone already knows exchanges get hacked all the time. No one is surprised by this, and most people had never even heard of NiceHash until now. Also, most miners dump their coins, but the hacker will probably hold them for a long time. If anything it's reduced sell pressure, not increased. Altcoins might take a dip though, because this affects their mining, it doesn't really affect Bitcoin at all.

Why don't you create a Bitcoin startup with those funds instead? The ecosystem needs it. Give back to the thing that made you rich. With 250k you could create quite a powerful Bitcoin campaign too. You could crowdfund a Times Square billboard or a Superbowl ad. There are also plenty of free crypto related services that are in need of donations. I don't see a point in giving back to vultures, give to the thing that has done so much for you instead.

That's wrong. It's pure masturbation to pick exact price targets, but not to predict a rise. The rise was obvious to anyone who understood what they were dealing with, and to say a competitor could have appeared is not understanding Bitcoin. Competitors DID appear, many of them in fact, and none of them have ever and will ever threaten Bitcoin in any serious way. Bitcoin has first mover advantage, you don't understand how powerful that is. Bitcoin may lose the "e-currency" battle, but it will never lose the digital gold battle. There can only ever be one digital gold.

To be fair it isn't proof that it *could* have happened either.


Yeah, but you can dismiss every prediction as "luck" if you want to, including every failed prediction, it was just "luck" that I was wrong for example. I call that lack of accountability. I take as much responsibility for my correct decisions as I do my failed ones, that is how I learn and grow and continue to gain more wealth. Fact is, if you keep getting all of your predictions right, if you can be extremely consistent, then it demonstrates there is more involved. In my case that's certainly been the case (otherwise I'd be broke). I have a natural talent for picking these things and it's something I'm very comfortable with given my technical background. I've made a substantial living from it. 
I don't pretend to be a genius, but to dismiss my talent as "luck" is offensive. There is no doubt luck involved, but it's not primarily luck and there is luck involved in every aspect of life. Mark Zuckerberg isn't good at what he does, he just got "lucky". Mark Cuban isn't good at what he does, he just got "lucky". Donald Trump isn't good at what he does, he just got "lucky" and had a handout. Elon Musk isn't good at what he does, he just got "lucky" and had investors to throw him free money. You hear people saying it about some of the most successful people on the planet, and it's bullshit. If you can say it about these people then where do you draw the line? Any successful person is merely "lucky"? Please. It may look that way on the surface if you only do a three second analysis, but if you actually analyze their accomplishments and the decisions they made, you realize there's far more to it. I just made wise decisions based on logic and fact, and had an inherent interest and passion that kept me going. It takes a lot of right decisions to gain wealth and maintain it, and a single bad decision to lose it all. TLDR: OP was full of shit when he said "it's just luck, like winning the lottery", it's not that simple. It doesn't make you a genius, but it does make you right.

@_date: 2017-12-06 11:33:32
Sure, I'm okay with missed opportunity. I'm talking about people who were looking for something to invest in, analyzed Bitcoin as an investment and decided against it based on the analysis. That I would call a mistake. Every low liquidity investment is going to be volatile, if you're concerned about volatility then you're never going to get in on the ground floor. That can be a chosen strategy if you're a more conservative investor looking for smaller and safer returns, but if that's what your after then Bitcoin will not be appealing to you for a longgg time. Those people are better off sticking with bonds or something.

He deleted his reply though so it's hard for you to see the context unfortunately. As for being luck nothing more, you're simply wrong. I've explained why in other comments. It's a delusional dismissive attitude of someone lacking understanding of what it takes to succeed in crypto. People who think it's luck sell at 10x or do something stupid (like this:  people who understand fundamentals hold long term for 1000x and above. Anyway Microsoft and Apple are poor comparisons for multiple reasons, but I'm sure there are plenty of Bitcoin holders that also invested in SpaceX, which is more along the lines of Bitcoins timeline.

No, I'm specifically referring to right outcome.


Not that I can remember. Can you point to an example? I can only think of FUD designed to cause market panic to buy cheap coins. I can't think of a time were Bitcoin was legitimately threatened by an alternative.


It's not a newer idea, it was a core belief when I got involved in 2012. I've been holding and trading since. Maybe it wasn't a belief before I got involved, but it has been since. It's easy to see where the value add is when you consider that the young generation will need a hedge to the existing monetary system in the way that gold is, but in a digital world gold is mighty inconvenient. It's a natural fit.

You're the one supporting the OP's statement. He said it was winning the lottery, as lucky as choosing the right numbers, and then you went on to argue in his favor, so I'm not sure what kind of a response you expected? Anyway, not butthurt, just making a statement. Clearly we disagree on the levels of luck involved, and that's fine, you're entitled to your opinion as I am mine.


I don't disagree, that's why I think luck is definitely a factor, I just think it's a smaller one than you think it is. In my eyes, people make their own luck for the most part, and those who place "luck" as a driving factor for either success or failure are those who are not taking an appropriate level of self responsibility in life. You could say that it's unlucky that you got hit by a bus, but perhaps you should have been paying more attention. Unlucky that you got hit by lightning, perhaps you shouldn't have been fucking around in an open field in a crazy lightning storm. You see where I'm going with this. If you can take responsibility for your losses then you deserve to be able to take responsibility for your wins, as far as I'm concerned anyway. At the end of the day this is probably just a matter of perspective, and we disagree on it at a philosophical level.
People too often blame their shitty life circumstances on luck and fail to step back and take a look at the decisions they made to get them there. Sure, maybe the particular thing that just happened to you was a case of bad luck, but why are you in that position to receive that bad luck in the first place? You got yourself there. Again, I just think it's a dismissive and "shift-the-blame" philosophy and mentality, and I think it's an unhealthy one that is not conducive to making wealth.

Conflicting opinions aside, the answers are simple:
* Don't ask others whether you should buy or sell, that's your decision and anyone who tells you what to do is biased. If you want to ask what the price is going to do to see what other people think that is fine, but you need to remember that nobody *knows*, and unless you can pick out the experienced users from the idiots it's not going to be very helpful.
* This is a bubble, but that doesn't mean it's going to pop any time soon, and for all we know the price may never reach this low again.
* Waiting for a dip is one strategy, but so is buying now. Nobody can tell you whether or not it's going to dip below the current price again with 100% certainty.
* Diversification is good, but Bitcoin is currently outperforming almost every single alt and has been for a while now. Alts can make massive returns if you pick the right ones, but there is obviously increased risk involved. The decision to buy alts should be a balance of factors: Your ability to pick winners based on your knowledge of the ecosystem and technology, your risk threshold, and your strategy (get rich quick, make slow but steady gains, etc).
* Hardware wallets are **far** more convenient if you plan on using your Bitcoin (even if it's just buying and selling). If you want to lock your coins away for a few years and never touch them then a paper wallet is a fine option too. This comes down to a balance between security and convenience. Personally I think hardware wallets are more than secure enough to warrant the extra convenience.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:34:56

It's important to realize that your over-simplistic viewpoint is wrong. There are plenty of clever investors who saw this coming from a mile away, and there are plenty of gamblers who had no idea and were crossing their fingers. Don't treat everyone the same. Your lottery analogy is retarded too, because it's not even close to the same thing. Let me guess, you were one of the people back in the day saying that Bitcoin was a bad idea to purchase, and  now that you've been proven wrong and joined the bandwagon your only respite is to claim that it was all just luck? Sorry champ, but you made the wrong call, you can only blame yourself for that. Take some responsibility and learn from your mistakes, grow from it. Or don't, and get no where.

Yeah, that's very unlikely to happen, unless they've been stocking up on Bitcoin for years and years they won't have enough of a supply for this to be a profitable model. It'd actually be a lot easier for them to do the inverse though, manipulate the exchange markets upward and pump their futures. Also these futures require a lot of collateral, they're not the same as other future offerings by CME.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:11:11
Exactly. It's just undermining peoples accomplishments because they have no idea what they're talking about and don't know what is actually involved to get to that level. I'd like to see them with hundreds of BTC back in the day, they'd have probably sold them at 5x. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:42:08
What people are failing to see is that there is a much more profitable model: Long futures, manipulate price on exchanges with buy orders. This has the benefit of not requiring a huge stockpile of coins to begin, they can just hold USD until they are ready. Unless these 'large shorters' have been stockpiling coins for a couple of years, the 'short' strategy is going to yield an unremarkable return (and expose them to considerable legal risk, because it will raise a lot of attention). They're exposing themselves to a lot of counterparty risk if they try and dump all their coins on an exchange in a tanking market.
I think what we'll see is actually a balance of forces, there needs to be massive collusion for there to be an orchestrated short attempt against Bitcoin and it's unlikely to happen. What's more likely is that groups of organized people all having different strategies, and the net result is an upward price movement through the added volume due to the increased attention and investors this market will bring, and higher short-term volatility due to the uncertainty and euphoria in the market.
Another significant point that people are missing is that these futures are different to traditional futures in that they require a lot of backing collateral. You won't be able to operate on large margin like you can with other futures (only 10-20% for these futures is likely to be seen), so again, the short strategy is even less likely than people are imagining.

Not true, many whales fail to manipulate the markets and buy back in at a loss all the time. If your market sell drops the price by $100 and bots instantly push it up another $50 from that bottom then you buy back in at a loss. Point is, it's not a fool proof strategy, and to say it "IS" that simple shows that you lack experience and you've never tried to manipulate the markets (because you can't afford to, probably).

If you have to ask this you don't have 5m in coins, so either you're trolling or you're asking for the future. In either case, advice is not relevant to you.

Yes, you could... Bitfinex was one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges before they were hacked, and margin short was always possible.

It's not that simple. Sell a lot of Bitcoin and cause panic, if the panic is too great then your rebuy is now operating at a loss because the markets either continued to slide (so you're down in dollar value) or they were instantly bought back up (so you're down in Bitcoin AND dollar value). There's also the fact that if it's a market sell and market buy you probably end up either where you started or at a loss.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:38:22

Hahaha, if anyone is surprised by this they are pretty stupid.
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:42:53
You're misinformed. PoW does not secure the network, it makes the network vulnerable to centralization. The only purpose of the blockchain is to perform transactions synchronously in batches, opposed to asynchronously. The reason it was designed this way by Satoshi is because it is incredibly simpler to implement and design. Back then, this was all cutting edge, and the 'mining' concept was seen as a strong contender as the plausible solution to Sybil attack resistance, network reward \(game theory\), and the byzantine generals problem. Back then, things like block lattice where not even conceived of. We've come a long way since and learned a lot in the process, and now radical new evolutions of the existing limited system have started spawning that do away with a lot of the major weaknesses of the existing technology.
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:35:05
Block lattice is infinitely more green. Blockchain is old, dying technology. Mining is a waste of resources, and accomplishes nothing. Anyone saying that Bitcoin is not a waste of resources is either naive, lying, or dodging. The 2.0 cryptocurrencies are the Facebook to Bitcoin's MySpace. Not going to name the coins that use block lattice because the mods here will probably ban me though.

There are two people in a queue. You, and another guy. You and him have been standing there waiting for close to 4 hours so far, as each visit is expected to take roughly 4 hours. A stranger walks off the street and approaches the stranger at the front and says that he will pay him $100 to cut in line behind him.

It is true, but it's okay if only my close friends (who witnessed it happen) believe me.
Anyway, my plan is to rebuy all the way down to 3k. A lot of people will tell me I'm wrong for thinking it'll hit that low (I've been saying it since we started falling from 19k), but they'll see :-). I've just started dollar cost averaging now.
@_date: 2018-06-20 04:14:33
It doesn't work so well though. It's highly Chinese centralized, it consumes insane amounts of power, it scales to single digit transactions per second (LOL), it has insane fees. It's one of the worst solutions out there these days. The only thing it has going for it is first mover advantage, a strong development team, and large amounts of surrounding infrastructure. If it weren't for those things, it'd already have been overtaken by a competitor. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Bitcoin is a piece of crap. I'm just saying that it's falling to the wayside.
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:54:08
Got in at $100. Sold all the way from $15,000-$19,000. The day after I finished selling the price started tanking.

DAG coins do what lightning network does. In fact, they are as scalable as is our internet infrastructure. Most would call that infinitely scalable. Much easier to optimise a DAG coin than it is to monkey patch Bitcoin to support upgrades to LN.

I concur with the above, please fix the performance. Also, is there a way to do away with the monthly withdrawal limit? I'm okay with a daily limit, all exchanges have one, but a monthly limit is retarded. All it does is make me use your exchange less. I don't like holding coins on exchanges, and so it means I can only perform one trade a month basically, forcing me to use other exchanges to fill in the gaps. I'd also add that Bittrex has FAR more reasonable daily withdrawal limits (100btc). I shouldn't have to slowly siphon my own money out of your exchange, that's for exchanges that are running a fractional reserve, and you guys claim you are not.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:17:11
Spoken like someone who has no idea what they're talking about.


That's the dumbest fucking argument I've ever heard, and is simply not the case of the attack is cheap (and it is) and the spammers have a lot of money (they do). It _could_ go on indefinitely, if they desire it to.


IOTA is not a scam, and neither are the handful of Bitcoin alternatives that have newer technology and solve the problems that Bitcoin has, and I challenge you to provide evidence to support the claim. I can sum up your statement: "Anything that is not Bitcoin is a scam because it's not Bitcoin", it's circular and moronic logic, and it's a blatant fabrication.


I'm not. You obviously don't understand how Bitcoin fees work. The spammer transactions won't even get eaten unless the miners choose to clear the lower-fee transactions (which isn't going to happen because they'd be throwing away money for no reason).

Bitstamp has a good reputation. Bitfinex did until all of the hack and Tether drama. Bittrex is great for altcoins. Lykke is really good but they're mobile only and don't service US customers, they're also low liquidity. Your options are pretty limited to be fair, but it also depends on what you're trying to do with the exchange. Trade BTC for alts and back? Trade for USD? Trade for Tether? Cash out to a bank account? etc.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:02:05
When wrong, double down. That's what I've taken from that article. Not surprised to see that level of blind determination from a domain called "seekingalpha" lmfao. Anyway, the answer is obvious. Bitcoin is much more like the dotcom bubble and the internet than it is a fucking useless flower. Comparing the charts is pointless. Also those tweets are hilarious as fuck, every single rich person I know has their money in crypto. That's just called subjective analysis, and it means nothing. Also if you don't know a single rich person in crypto you're not trying hard enough, the media covers that quite well.

You're the only gullible person here. You read that IOTA was a scam by some other Bitcoin maximalist like yourself and automatically took it as gospel because it supports your own investment portfolio and your own narrative. Fact is you can't even tell me why it (or any of the other alts that are attempting to make a better Bitcoin) is a scam. You're gullible because you can't even think for yourself. You're doing the same thing Jamie Dimon does, and that is put down something he doesn't understand. Just because you don't understand something, doesn't mean it's bad. It means you need an education, and if you're putting it down it means you're emotionally attached and you're going to make bad investment decisions. Either that or you're an over-leveraged shill and you think someone is going to make an investment decision based on your post. That'll never happen because it's obvious you don't even understand the things you're talking about.


I already explained it, but I guess I'll explain it again because you failed to comprehend.
If the miners are not mining the spam transactions, they sit in the mempool pushing up the cost of the other transactions. This can happen indefinitely until they're mined and included in a block. So no, the attack is actually cheap if the attackers know what they're doing. You also need to remember that the largest mining pool is involved in the attack, so they're recouperating around 40% of their costs anyway. 
Here you go, here's another comment from someone who knows what the fuck they're talking about:  -- Educate yourself please.


@_date: 2017-11-30 12:33:20
If you don't use coinbase, pay your tax, or haven't done anything other than buy coins you have nothing to worry about. Bitcoin is perfectly legal, but the IRS DOES want their tax dollars.

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:01:29


Pretty much. Bitcoin has first mover advantage and the largest supporting ecosystem, so it is the most trusted and easiest to get involved with out of all the other coins. Once the new wave of investors start learning more about the ecosystem they'll start to diversify into altcoins and the money will trickle down. A lot of this rally is due to speculation of the CME futures market opening in December, which will bring fresh Wall Street capital. As things get shakier keep an eye out for altcoin rallies though. Ethereum is set to take off next I think, and it usually plays out like that (biggest market cap coin to second largest, and so on).
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:04:36
Tether sucks, but this really has nothing to do with Bitcoin. Also, what's to stop the attacker from tainting peoples Tether addresses? The attacker could just spray coins everywhere and fuck with the entire Tether network.

@_date: 2017-11-22 04:04:12
I understand what you said, but my point still stands, it's irrelevant. Either Bitfinex have control over the Bitstamp hack wallet, or they sent the "hacked" Tether to an address associated to the Bitstamp hacker. In either case, your evidence does not mean anything because anyone can send coins to any address. I think you're the one struggling with reading comprehension here, what I'm saying is not even debatable. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:17:37

Thanks, so sounds like it's up to the ATO's discretion whether or not I'm operating a business of trading, and to "play it safe" I'd be filing income tax. I do wonder if it's worth the risk to just file CGT (since it is much cheaper with the CGT discount), and see what happens. In the event the ATO disputes it, I wonder if they'd just let it fly, or if there would be fines involved. It seems like something that is sort of controversial, so I find it hard to believe they'd jump to fining or auditing me. What you've said is actually inline with the advice I received from my accountant, but it's good to confirm it.

@_date: 2017-11-22 03:41:06
Hate to break it to you, but anyone can send coins to any address. This is not proof in the slightest. For all we know, Tether did this to burn 30m in tokens. In fact, I'd say this scenario actually paints Tether as the even more likely culprit now. Why would the Bitstamp hacker use an address that is already associated to a previous hack, that's just foolish, unless of course it wasn't them and someone is just trying to pin the blame on them.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:32:04


Your claims are entirely unfounded, it's easy to make up bullshit, anyone can do it. Even if what you're saying is true, this is nothing like MtGox because this hack is going to have zero impact on anything because those tokens are never going to be redeemed, and they're already blacklisted on all of the exchanges. Even if what you're saying is true, there's no reason for it to stop now. So yeah, keep making up your fantasies, I know you're behind that Bitfinexed twitter account.

@_date: 2017-11-18 16:48:19
I take it you're both about 16? Btw mining is obviously profitable to a lot of people. It's about having optimized equipment and low energy costs (like the Antminer S9). It's also profitable if you hold the Bitcoin rewards and Bitcoin appreciates heavily. Your arrogance is misguided, whilst your "friend" has no fucking idea what he's talking about, neither do you.

@_date: 2017-11-30 16:28:58
That'd be nice, but I really doubt it'd happen. :( Too much bull left in this market for that, especially with all these futures markets opening to Bitcoin soon.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:18:35


That does not matter.


I'm not failing to understand that point at all, let me spell this out:
1. Tether can see the Bitstamp hackers wallet and what transactions are sent *from* it.
2. Bitstamp hacker sends some funds to address ABC.
3. Tether stage a "hack" and send some funds to address ABC to draw the association.
4. You come on Reddit saying "Bitstamp hacker also hacked Tether!"
Now, what you're saying may be true, but it also may not be. My point is that you can't make a conclusion based on the evidence you've provided because it could be manipulation.

They're freaking out because they haven't been paying their taxes, obviously.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:46:55
It's going to be the opposite actually. This will send it to the moon.

Thanks Greg. What are the implications of something like this, however? 
In particular, this part:






Note that all NIST P curves are considered "not safe": 
What are the implications of a backdoored ECSDA? Would this mean that private keys could be discovered, or is there another layer of protection that Bitcoin utilizes?

Every single rich Bitcoiner I know has bought expensive purchases with their coins (luxury cars, bikes, computers, etc). You're living in a textbook fantasy world. Let me guess, some PhD economist told you it so you believe it's fact now? For every economist who says one thing, there's another who says the opposite.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:40:43
That really doesn't answer my question, at all.

It's a cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar and backed by a reserve.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:40:44


 Well put. Very eloquent. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:38:00
It means Wall Street money will be entering the markets.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:16:28
No, more like 10-15%. (500mill) The volume statistics are public knowledge, you don't need to make up numbers.


The word you're looking for is effect, but anyway, market cap is not a bad measure at all if you actually understand what it is. If Tether has only around 600m in assets, how do you suppose Bitfinex has 500m daily trading volume for BTC/USDT? Because most of it is recycled money, not fresh money. Fresh money is required to push the price up, and if you factor in how much of that Tether is fresh money it must be a very small percentage considering the total Tether market cap and the distribution of the Tether tokens, and it won't be moving the price much. 
If you want to know how much of an effect "fake Tether" could have on the market you should look at the Tether market cap growth rate. If we were to assume that all new Tether is fake Tether, and they're growing by 10m every day, then we can reasonably assume that 10m of the total BTC/USDT trading volume (provided all Tether tokens were traded) is fake. 10m out of a daily 4 bill volume is *nothing*, and will barely move the price. So again, I stand by my statement that Tether has a negligible impact on the BTC market.

Uh, no. The problem is not telling *people* about your Bitcoin profits, it's about telling retards. Lesson: Don't tell retards.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:37:26
Haha, classic. One day these clowns will give it a rest. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:49:10
Hate retards like that, automatic experts on subjects they know zero about. Shut the fuck up Uncle Bob and stick to milking cows.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:20:29


Yeah, this I can agree with. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:23:15
It's you who doesn't understand how the market works. 


Where did I say this? You are putting words in my mouth.


Uhm.. 600mil is the total market cap of Tether, not the daily trading volume of fresh Tether. Go look at my other post if you want an explanation of why you're mistaken. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:44:45
You're delusional if you think it doesn't. Traders make trades based on sentiment, and Reddit is one of the leading sources of that.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:05:29
Who cares.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:25:22
Well said.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:11:35
Sure it was.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:37:25


Even if what you're saying is correct (that it has more of an impact than I think), it does not matter, because this hack would not stop "fake money" from being injected into the ecosystem (if it was even happening).
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:22:35
Considering Tether only owns 600m in assets, it's pretty ridiculous to conclude that they have a massive impact on a 200bill market cap coin.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:37:59
This to me proves that the current system needs a massive retweak. Altcoins like IOTA are going to steal Bitcoin's launch if they can't innovate out these problems quickly. It shouldn't be this easy and cheap to attack the network and cost people millions of dollars in fees.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:39:56


They're all bubbles, some of them are just in a state of popping, others are in a state of expanding. A bubble isn't a bad thing, and if we have a necessary correction (what this is) then it will continue to grow. It's great.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:26:07
Stupidest idea ever. It worked with Bitfinex because:
1. they have a really high quality exchange and can handle scale.
2. they were quick to action.
3. they aren't run by morons.
Nobody would want to trust MtGox again, if they got hacked again there would be no third opportunity and so no one would get their money back. Also who would want to wait like 4 years until a resolution is found.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:19:09
Uh... I think you need to go outside.
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:07:14
Can you provide an updated version? Is there an interactive graph online we can look at?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:51:02

Jihan got his army of shills in here hey? It's obviously not an S9, or it wouldn't be outperforming one. Adam Back has already confirmed it's legit, and the project is supposedly BtcDrak's, who is a highly respected developer. This is great news for Bitcoin, and hopefully the beginning of the end of the Jihan monopoly.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:48:43
It's not that simple. If you put a buy at a $100 premium you're just going to get sold into instantly, and the price will drop back down to $6000, unless you have enough funds to hold the price and cause a shift in market sentiment, which is expensive to do. Very expensive.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:02:44
Huh? I've been here for years, the growth is legitimate, if that's what you're asking. That's why this sub has descended into meme chaos.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:03:09
Probably a good idea :). I was in your boat once, then I made amendments all the way back when I realized that if I wanted to sell a significant amount in the future I would be hosed. Paying tax sucks, but at least you get peace of mind.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:22:23


That manual recovery process is as simple as pressing a button in the new wallet, not exactly challenging.


I'm using the Android wallet, I haven't got that problem.


Uhmm, what? IOTA doesn't even have an SDK. You can use any open-source library you like. I have no idea what you're talking about in terms of reverse engineering the wallet, and I've never had a single crash on my node. Sounds like a you problem again.


Obviously. And the miners are the ones performing the attacks, so no, it isn't "expensive".
Anyway, it doesn't even need to be IOTA (although IOTA is a good contender), it can be any of the handful of alts that are designed purely to fix Bitcoins shortcomings. Yeah IOTA is pretty new (hence it's not at the same level of polish that Bitcoin is), but Bitcoin was at that point in its lifecycle once upon a time as well. As more and more people buy those coins the polish will increase, and Bitcoin will be further threatened.

Sure it would be big, but they're obviously not insolvent if they're printing free money... They would have a huge stockpile of free Bitcoin from it.

It's already done the 10k dip, you missed it. Went down to 9200. If you didn't buy the dip, sorry :'(
