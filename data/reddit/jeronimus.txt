Well yeah, but that's only after the new equilibrium has been established. I'm talking about the transition from where I have no Bitcoins. At time 0 where I am adopting the Bitcoin standard. If it implies work it implies that I am transferring my labor to someone who did nothing but predict the raise of Bitcoin. I would not give up my labor just to adopt the new standard. Plus all my existing wealth would need to be transferred again if I want to trade it.

For point one see the reply I've given below "Well yeah, but that's only after the new equilibrium has been established. I'm talking about the transition from where I have no Bitcoins.

For point two. We don't even know who Satoshi really is. The world already hates the super rich who maybe have contributed more to society. How can you imagine a future where Satoshi and the Winkle brothers own 7% of the world?

I wrote this to Andreas too. I wonder if he has a take on it.

So you're basically saying that non-bitcoin people have gotten their wealth in a fraudulent way (especially the super rich) and they deserve to lose it all in favor of the amazingly foresighted bitcoiners. But still they'd have to do this voluntarily. What could motivate them to it?
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs got rich because they created computers that people wanted. People traded their cash to get the computers. What do the people stand to gain if they trade their cash for Bitcoins?

I thought mining is neigh impossible now. Plus how would ordinary folks mine it? Wouldn't that require super strong computers. And aren't Bitcoins in finite supply. What about when all have been mined? 
If they exchange a good or service for it is exactly the problem I'm asking about. It's a transfer of wealth. What if the price of bitcoin reaches 100k. I'd have to trade my house for it. Sure I could buy just a small part of bitcoin but it's a transfer of wealth.

But what if there are no bitcoins to transact with. What if I have to buy it from Winkle brothers at a super high price buy another apartment and then hold my savings in Bitcoin? And sure, this argument does apply to any asset, particularly Gold when it was the Gold standard, but why would the population switch to this new standard and incur a transfer loss in the process?

So if this process is so gradual to take several centuries, why is the current price of Bitcoin so high to suggest imminent lunar landing?
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:00:23
You didn't answer the question. If my argument is so stupid, surely it would be very easy for you to debunk it.

CoinCult, maybe your name is indicative why it's not worth it for you to debate it.

You mean exactly like bitcoin?

Andreas, you're a smart guy so maybe you can solve this quandary I have. Imagine a future where all transactions are done with Bitcoin. How would this work?
In order for all transactions for goods and services to be done with Bitcoin, the rest of the population, who wasn't smart enough to buy Bitcoin when it was cheap, would have to buy it from the people who already own it. It would be a massive transfer of wealth from people with no Bitcoin to people with Bitcoin. And all this to gain what? The privilege to not pay the transaction fees you pay to your credit card company and to not have the 2% per year inflation that erodes the small value that you hold in cash?
In other words I would have to sell my house to buy a Bitcoin just to be able to buy food and not barter. This adoption of Bitcoin for the people that either are skeptics now or never heard of it would have to be voluntary. So I ask the Bitcoin community, how do you guys see this problem solved? Why would the non Bitcoin people voluntarily abandon the current system and incur a massive loss of wealth in favor of Bitcoin holders? In this scenario, Satoshi would own 5% of the world's assets. How could the rest of the word possibly agree to this?

I already addressed this in the comment you're replying to. I knew that.

No, but all my wealth would have to correspond to an amount in Bitcoin. Or to put it in reverse, anyone with a Bitcoin could buy everything I own. It would be like when the Spanish found a lot of gold in South America in the 1600's and they became super rich overnight. It was a massive wealth transfer.

why not sell now then?

Yeah, you tell him how it is, lol.

They aren't subjective for non amateurs.

I do. I think the long term price of Bitcoin is 0. The fundamental value.
