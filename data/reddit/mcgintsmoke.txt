Who ever panic sells the bitcoin at a rate blows the current asking price to his fellow man is either a fool or a coward. He who cannot hodl through a slight dip and sells before reaching their CGT concessions is both. For a bitcoin bull shall say to any seller he encounters, If I die you are forgiven, but if I live I will kill you. 
Such is the rule of honor.

It still amazes me that there is selling occurring right now - it literally makes zero sense

“It’s going to retrace to $7k” - A pack of dense cunts

It’s amazing how quickly I become accustomed to the new price. Watching the “dip” to where it was still higher than YTD high even yesterday still hurts like hell!

See, you did the right thing and bought

Pure genius. Well done on this one

Incorrect. A correction can’t occur if nobody puts a sell order in for less than the current price.

Incorrect. Anyone who sells should be pursued mercilessly and punished severely.

Thank you for responding. This has to be one of the most insightful and well thought out comments I’ve read on this sub, great post

Could it just hurry up and hit 250k already? I’ve seriously had a gut full of this rubbish. Don’t people realise that if you DONT SELL the price doesn’t fall? Fucking cunts

The cowardice in this bull cycle is palpable

I’m actually surprised that it hasn’t rallied harder to be honest, the fact that there have been mini-dips even is baffling
