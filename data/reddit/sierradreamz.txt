It doesn't matter if they were FDIC insured or not. The USD wasn't stolen.
I mean it does matter for the future in case of that bank going under, but for the purposes of the hack, it does not matter.

Yes it is..very cool.

I searched for "porn" earlier and just got like 20 identical listings that said "child pornography".   They seemed fake and like spam, but I didn't click on them to check and just did "Ignore" on one of them and they all disappeared.
@_date: 2016-04-05 00:35:27
Interesting. I didn't even think about buying porno clips like this.  But you don't explain in your listing how the buyer gets the content. Do you email them a file or send them a link to download it or a URL to view it or what?  
Just giving you some constructive feedback. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 13:10:30
How could you be "certain the price is going to at least double around the halvening"?
Of course you can't be certain of that, so your entire question makes no sense due to invalid premise.
@_date: 2015-12-26 14:46:51
Not sure but that would certainly do it.
@_date: 2015-12-27 13:57:54
These kinds of things freak me the f*ck out.  I just closed my long and went net short a small amount.  A 51% attack could put us back in the $100s for gods sake.   
And probably won't be a disaster but I'm just going to protect my cold storage until this situation is more clear.
@_date: 2015-12-19 08:39:34
Yes another reason why I have a man crush on Andreas.
@_date: 2015-12-29 02:58:27
Yes people love to repeat that like some kind of mantra, yet it is nonsense.  That is true for every other speculative investment as well.  Every company on every stock exchange...every commodity, etc etc etc

Thanks for checking in.  I am Mastercard CEO, but I still respect your honestly, even though you are head of the competition.
@_date: 2016-01-24 02:39:14
Yes no kidding and I'm glad everyone is not as delusional as many on here.
@_date: 2016-01-13 00:58:26
Good news long-term...but bad news for anyone who owns BTC now and doesn't want their assets cut in value dramatically.
@_date: 2016-01-25 01:13:34
It doesn't matter if you want Ticketmaster to be cut out entirely.  It doesn't matter if I do..or the artists do.  They have to play somewhere and the venues and Ticketmaster don't want it to be cut out...so it won't be.
@_date: 2016-01-27 13:02:15
Yes their strategy definitely worked and they made a sick amount of $ if they were long.  ETH is up something like 100% in the last two or three weeks.
@_date: 2016-01-13 01:15:05
Just look at the chart and you'll see the beginnings of why.  When we are in the 300s, you'll see more and then if we end up back in the 200s, will be a more emphatic answer.
The last time there was big block size controversy, price went down to $170.

F*ck Coinbase.  They are evil and they steal from their customers, so glad to hear when anything bad happens to them.
@_date: 2016-01-04 17:51:14
You have been able to do that in the USA for a long time.  Just buy Amazon gift cards with gyft.com (or similiar).  Maybe this eliminates that one extra step but seems like an insignificant difference.
Bitcoin has failed as a payment mechanism....it has failed as a currency.  It is good for store of value and speculation and decent for remittances and that's about it.
@_date: 2016-01-09 23:09:00
Comic books weren't down either but no one cares about them but a bunch of geeks and same with bitcoin.
And I'm a geek who cares but doesn't change the truth.

This meeting was held about 3 years ago, although many of you don't want to accept that.
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:25:53
So the people who sold/shorted at $450 and are buying back LOTS more BTC at $370 are "impatient" and don't have "cool hands"????
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL !
You may be doing all this out of principle and/or as some kind of bizarre performance art, but some other people like to grow the value of their assets over time to the maximum extent.
@_date: 2016-01-13 01:43:52
They are already worth 5% less on the news.   They will be worth way less because the market will value them way less, based on the uncertainty. 
A hard fork in BTC is big news.  It will confuse a lot of people and there will be many articles about it (bad press) and many people will take their money off the table until all this has blown over.
Research what "hard fork" is and you will see how ugly this could all get.   But it's not me saying that BTC deserves to be lower.  The market says it is worth $20 less already and I'm betting it will be less that that soon.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:32:56
Yes I don't get why someone would keep it on paper.  I would just encrypt it with PGP or TrueCrypt. You could put it on multiple USB drives, upload it to the Cloud..whatever you want.  As long as quantum computing doesn't break the encryption, then you are fine.  
@_date: 2016-01-21 07:45:31
It didn't bounce back to $275 so I'm afraid you are incorrect.
@_date: 2016-01-22 02:01:34
Always a good idea to glorify your enemy on a huge billboard.
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:07:07
Well ETH has been an incredible hedge over the past few weeks. I wish I would have been smart enough to jump into it earlier. It may be too late at this point.   But I do like how it moves independently of what BTC does.
@_date: 2016-01-12 05:25:00
No it's not a joke.  Whoever is excited by this "news" is the big joke.
@_date: 2016-01-24 19:30:37
Ticketmaster has exclusive deals with the venues who get kickbacks on these fees.  So why would the venues go for this and throw away their share of the extra fees? 
A:  They wouldn't.

Some say 1/10 have been lost over time.
Some say 1/2 have been lost over time.
Some say 1/50th have been lost over time
Some say they can talk to the dead
Some say they have magical powers to see the future.
Some say lots of things, because there a whole lot of people out there who say things.

Business is not about being "shit" or not.  It's about making a profit..it's about maximizing your profits. That's why you are poor and broke and the head of VISA has a yacht and is banging hot hookers twice a week.  And same with the head of Home Depot and they aren't going to throw away tens of millions of USD profit just to fight VISA and make you think they aren't "shit".
@_date: 2016-06-02 02:14:55
I didn't say it would cause a huge crash.  But it's supply and demand and the 200K BTC in one day is a significant increase in the supply there for trading.
@_date: 2016-06-18 21:54:15
He's a dreamer drinking kool-aid. He's not being practical about this.
@_date: 2016-06-03 09:42:01
Yes of course, although a lot depends on if BTC is rallying at the time or now.
@_date: 2016-06-22 04:30:32


Fixed that for you...or at least expanded on what you said.
@_date: 2016-12-18 02:52:00
Well not a civil war but a coup.   I guess the military has big guns and tanks and are aligned with the ruling gov't.

@_date: 2016-02-03 01:29:45
Oh yeah it will....if there even will be any LBC traders left in Europe after this starts being enforced.
@_date: 2016-02-03 13:19:00
Yes it's harder, but what you do is take people who do anonymous bitcoin (or cash) transactions and you lock them in prison and then they can't do it any more.... and others are less inclined to do it as well.
@_date: 2016-02-14 22:27:03
It can be illegal the same way that growing a plant and smoking the leaves is illegal.  And yes they could make Starbucks illegal if they wanted to.
@_date: 2016-02-10 18:52:13
You give yourself the right to violate their rights, because they don't have a right, beyond a legal one...which is wrong in this case.

Ebay and Paypal are two of the most evil companies around...they don't need any help with that.
@_date: 2016-02-03 07:31:05
Yes and it's my understanding that you do not allow anyone from Germany to post local in person trades, as result of the regulations and laws there.  If this is expanded to all of Europe, that is a very negative development for Bitcoin.
To not be able to buy BTC in a face to face transaction with cash/fiat is a big restriction, especially on new buyers.
@_date: 2016-02-11 00:30:55
Yes well yes that is a bit more complicated but I wasn't even talking about anything like that.   Even credit cards are pretty simple with a 22% interest rate is not something you want.  
But avg IQ is 100 and a full half of the people on the earth.. 3.5 billion people have IQ lower than 100.  That explains a lot.
However a lot of people just would rather spend with wild abandon and then they say they don't know why they are always broke...usually very simple answer why.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:46:42
I know doesn't matter now but not smart to have 2FA sitting on your computer with easy access.   You want 2FA to be on a different device so if one is compromised, you are still safe.
@_date: 2016-02-17 11:59:00
Of course it's a step forward.  Who knows when we will reach the finish line..could still be a year or longer, but at least some progress.
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:47:04
Interesting....from that data, it looks like Asians are the smartest and blacks are the least smartest (i.e. dumbest), on average, but of course I would never say that because extremely politically incorrect, even if factual data.
@_date: 2016-02-16 22:56:15
I wonder if they are going to release that information yet or if this stage is just saying if your claim was valid or not.  I have a feeling will be another several months until we get more info than this.
@_date: 2016-02-10 12:57:32
People don't understand money because they don't want to.  It's much easier to buy what you want at that moment, rather than thinking about the consequences. 
Money is just addition and subtraction...not even any multiplication or division involved.  Just don't spend more than you have....very simple.
@_date: 2016-10-23 11:14:20
You are partly correct but to say the two parties are identical is absurd.   But yes they probably try to be different from one another to keep the population evenly divided and to make them think that the other party is their enemy and not the Power Elite that is f*cking them hard every day.
@_date: 2016-10-11 08:42:11
Your only hope is probably to hammer them publicly and expose them for what they are until they finally give you your money back and hope you just go away and keep your mouth shut.
I would be posting about this every day on mutliple forums...Ethereum forums, Bitcointalk forum, Twitter...everywhere you can think of.     This will cause them to lose business and they can't afford to have that happen, especially right now.
Being nice probably isn't going to help because they aren't nice...they are trying to steal your funds.  But good luck and just expose, expose, expose.
@_date: 2016-10-19 21:14:37


They think it should be made possible with both Bitcoin and cash/fiat.  
@_date: 2016-10-19 03:00:52
Only way not to expose yourself to Bitcoin scams is to keep all your funds in cold storage and never use any Bitcoin service or exchange.   That is an absurd length to go to and crazy it's come to that, but it has.
@_date: 2016-10-19 18:52:50
What would be better for Bitcoin is if they shot anyone found using or holding any Bitcoin.

It's not about "rights'.  It's about getting drone strikes or at least economic sanctions if you don't play ball with the money elite in Wash DC.  Might makes right.

No one is going to revolt as long as they have food and television.  And as Trump's support shows, about half the population will believe everything you tell them.   Avg IQ is 100 and half of the people in the world fall below that and it explains a lot.
@_date: 2016-10-11 23:18:46
@_date: 2015-11-28 19:53:19
Well maybe not last chance but a chance that will fail because right now it's like France during Louis XIV reign and all the power is concentrated among a very small # of people.  And they aren't going allow Bitcoin to do much more than it already has.
@_date: 2016-05-29 11:07:26
If this happens during China pump, they won't let it affect the price.  But otherwise of course it would be negative.
When the 200,000 Gox BTC is released, that is when it's really going to be time to short.
@_date: 2016-10-19 21:13:32
Yep, they are tightening the screws.  And they will just get tighter and tighter.
But don't worry.  They can't "kill" Bitcoin.  They can limit is usage and adoption to where the price is down to $100 per BTC, but they can't kill it so you can all celebrate and be happy.  
First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you and then they win.
