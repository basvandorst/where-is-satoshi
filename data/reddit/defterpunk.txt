Credit cards have fees. Debit cards have fees.  There are real costs to using cash.  They are just super easy to ignore as a consumer in the US (and I assume other developed countries).
My experience in Peru, India: If you try to pay with an old bill, the vendor doesn't like it.  If you pay with a bill that is too big, the vendor doesn't like it.  Sometimes they will even refuse to make the transaction unless you pay with a smaller/newer bill.  Any method of acquiring cash (changing, ATM, bank) can require waiting in line (India) and fees.
I studied under some people that wrote papers on the supply chain of cash (between the central bank and the big commercial banks) in Mexico.  There is a lot of unseen stuff that adds up, but it is relatively small for each transaction so we ignore it.  If bitcoin fees get small enough to ignore for some transactions, it will be used for those transactions.  The fact that the marginal cost of conducting the transfer is upfront is probably a good thing.  It aligns incentives correctly.  Right now I probably don't consolidate my credit card transactions as much as would be socially optimal because I don't see the extra 2 cents it costs to split it up.  Shit, there is probably a paper in that.

Even I say that btc is not necessarily the end of innovation.  It is proving to be a very stout algorithm, but I wouldn't count out the possibility of some killer bug in it that blows the whole thing up.
That wouldn't mean that cryptocurrency is a busted idea.  We could just create an altcoin that is basically a patch.

1 is just a mistake (assuming we are talking about 1 party reversals, 2 party is already basically possible with btc).
Fixing 2 would require some sort of pegging.  Which would require some kind of reliance on some kind of central bank type thing.  It might be worth it for some people.  I could even see the Fed creating some sort of bitDollars that they have the power to control that they claim will forever be at parity with the dollar.  Not for me, but I could see some people preferring that.
Holy crap I could totally see the fed doing that.
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:34:08
In order to peg it properly, I would think it would have to be centralized. But as pointed out, I don't have a super deep knowledge of how this stuff works.
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:29:06
I suppose I do not know much about the dollar's being digital.  What I was imagining was a centralized ledger where people could give dollars to the Fed and in exchange get access to some kind of bitDollar thing which they can then trade around (using a centralized ledger which the Fed would control) without the need for a Bank of America or some such handling the transactions.  I didn't know that already existed.  What is it called and could you point me to information on that?  Like you said, their are things I could learn about the dollar.
Obviously people who don't want the Fed (or any other central authority) having total control of their currency wouldn't like that system.  But I could see why some people might see benefits for people who don't have access to BoA but do have access to the Fed through the internet and want to deal in dollars.

Yeah.  I never really thought of it, but the fact that bitcoin has fees that make lightning fast microtransactions too costly to be worthwhile shouldn't be seen as a bad thing.  Those fees are meant to reflect the cost of the transfer.  If it isn't worth that cost to send somebody half a cent for making a clever comment on reddit through a tipbot, then maybe you shouldn't be clogging up the block with the payment that you don't really care that much about.
I don't really know how bitcoins work.  Do transactions fill up blocks?  If a million people were willing to pay any transaction fee to make tiny payments, would they displace other transfers?

This can also become a problem if the Feds decide you are structuring.

Mini-paywalls for APIs as opposed to big paywalls.  We already have the equivalent of mini-paywalls for the WWW (advertising).  These mini-paywalls make it easy to go to a variety of sites pretty seamlessly.  The speaker in the video is positing that this system he is proposing might do the same thing for APIs.  He isn't suggesting extending this to you and I looking at webpages.  Ads work pretty well for now.

Do they have the buffalo chicken rollers in the Filipino ones?  Those things are the bomb.

I don't know much of what I am talking about, but if the value of bitcoin were really high (relative to the cost of processing power) would it not drive people to shove more processing power into the system (in order to get btc from mining or fees)?

Couldn't he have done the same exact thing with a credit card?  The only way he could have gotten a refund then would have been to fraudulently claim that it was a set of fraudulent charges.

If immibis has an address, then they've already done the hard stuff.  Getting set up is a pain in the butt.  In the US, opening a bank account is made easier by the fact that I can walk into a building and somebody will call me "sir" and walk me through their process.  There is nothing like that for Bitcoin that little old ladies trust yet.

In the article: They still take it.  The results of a few cases will show if you can get it back with a lot of legal effort.

Are you saying skysailer would want to sell everything (short) until the market reaches $25/btc or are you saying they should buy (go long) but only at a low price?
I hate long/short.  It is confusing.
@_date: 2015-04-03 14:44:34
No hassle, but they report large amounts.  They are legally required to report amounts greater than $10k.  If you send less than that frequently, they will take your stuff because they can say you are probably a drug dealer.

You are right.  I think that it could have worked as a link in a text post with some discussion of how these laws could backfire and lead to American expats using bitcoin.
As it is, this article doesn't belong here.

I have never found it necessary.  I have an uncle who took things to the other extreme and convinced himself that he would learn Japanese before he went there.  I don't think he ever went.  I think that's too bad.
I like just getting up and going.  I haven't been burned by it yet.  I have gone to places where my friends/family have been before, though.  Maybe it would be different if I didn't already have a good idea that there wouldn't be a problem.
For instance, right now I couldn't tell you what the Peruvian currency looks like and I don't have any.  But I know that the airport conversion works well enough to get cab fare and that there are solid storefronts that change money all over Lima.

Just to be sure.  You are saying that the thing that they are doing is buying 10k from local bitcoins or something then selling them on a public market?  Why would the source of the BTC change what is happening?  If I buy 10k from a public market and then sell it locally, would that be upward price manipulation?  Why would that be worse than buying and holding or buying and spending?

It may be because I don't have anything with Paycoin, so I wasn't paying attention, but I had no idea.  Is there some kind of mailing list I am not on that would let me know when Coinbase is terrible?
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:45:59
What's a 50x short?  Do you mean sell fifty bitcoins?  Do you mean borrow a million bitcoins and sell those with the promise to pay back the bitcoin later?
Doesn't profiting handsomely on selling 5000 on exchanges depend on what the price you bought them from me at and what price you sell them on the exchanges at?  You very well could take a loss on that.
If you are saying that you could borrow and sell the million BTC, sell the 5000 for next to nothing, then expect everyone else to sell for the same price you sold the 5000 at so you can pick up your million on the cheap, I think you will find yourself in a bind.  People don't just say "oh, I guess BTC aren't worth anything anymore because turdovski sold 5000 for next to nothing, I better give away my BTC".  They will say, "I wish I would have been the one to get the cheap BTC, that was a heck of a deal.  I will wait to sell mine until I can get what I think they're worth".
Market manipulation is hard as hell and most people who try it wind up deep in the hole.

That is possible.  I was just responding to the person saying the fees aren't huge.  They're huge.

$5 fee for $50.  $11.99 for $100.  $45 for $500.
I would say 10% is closer to correct than $5.  And yes, they charge a huge fee because people will pay it.
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:43:33
They would take somewhere around 10% to send money to my buddy 100 miles away (US gas station to US gas station).  Maybe they are just crazy inefficient and not profiting very much, but it isn't convenient and it is very expensive.

What do you mean "involved"?  What does our "job" entail?  Does bitcoin really have gender specific benefits?

I agree.  He is doing a lot of hyperbole and yelling. She is using it as a prompt for making good points at an appropriate decibel level.
They are playing off of each other to do cover a fun topic.  I prefer the moments when she is talking.
