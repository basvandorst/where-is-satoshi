What does "sidebar" mean?

Oh. So they'd be essentially worthless. But at least you can do it.

Sounds like it sucks. Why don't we just a: reprogram bitcoin to make more (if that's possible), or create a whole new system altogether? 
P.s, is bitcoin eventually doomed by design? Examples: human body, North Korean government, any mechanical apparatus, Justin Bieber?

Terrible. There's no way to game the system  to get a decent amount of free money, is there? In that case, I'm not going to use my computer to mine.

You're just that mad YOU have such a dumb username.

How does this work? PKI encryption? Who would be keeping track of the private keys? And if this isn't owned by some guy in a mansion, why don't we just say "that's it. I'm gonna create my own intranet, and make as much bitcoins as I want!!!"

I guess not! But it sure makes you feel safer.
Unless you're selling drugs or guns or god knows what

Computer science is interesting 
@_date: 2017-02-22 02:47:06
Here's a problem. As more people join and "mine", the existing miners will get less out of it. Eventually, there will be so many miners, none of them will get paid hardly anything, they won't be able to afford to keep their computers online, and the network will go down faster than a brain without oxygen.

thanks. fixed the contraction. I'd throw you some pretty bad insults, but considering what we post is on the internet until the end of time, I'd rather not flipyouthebird. no pun intended.

Double the price of mining?
