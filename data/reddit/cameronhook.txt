Not to play devils advocate, but GAW announced that they are releasing a plug-in that will convert paycoin to fiat automatically on those sites, not that they have directly partnered with them. But yes, this whole thing is suspicious.
@_date: 2014-12-30 07:49:13
they have given miners their coins to sell on the open market, shit, i sold 24 of them at $9 each on cryptsy, i mean, don't get me wrong i was happy to get away from GAW but you aren't writing facts at all.

Excuse me if I'm ignorant, I'm not exactly new to crypto but still have questions, bitpay is more of a middle-man with all of this, right? in that they take the bitcoins but convert it to fiat for microsoft, so they are kind of like an bitcoin auto-reseller? wouldn't big companies using things like this actually reduce bitcoins price because of all the selling?

To be fair, while gaw is very shady people on here misunderstand a lot, paybase just uses the amazon api, they dont claim to be directly partnered with them.

no need to call him faggot, gay people are too good to be compared to that guy
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:01:00
yeah and they also are quick to hand over your info to the feds, no thanks, privateinternetaccess for me
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:56:19
lol what? you do realise megaupload and mega.co.nz were and are around the top visited sites in the world, right? your post is nonsensical.
@_date: 2015-01-03 10:24:40
Well clearly whatever the US is isn't working
@_date: 2015-01-03 10:22:24
Tell that to North Korea
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:00:04
Can you name the countries it doesn't work in? because I don't know of any, it definitely worked in Australia, NZ and most of Europe
@_date: 2015-01-03 10:23:14
you clearly don't understand
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:09:56
i find it hard to believe that you have $165 million in BTC
@_date: 2016-01-17 08:33:06
No, that stuff happens sometimes on here with plenty of companies.
@_date: 2015-05-21 01:29:39


And that they are just batshit crazy in general and would ruin the country even more than it already is.
@_date: 2015-08-24 09:25:10
Haha no you are very wrong. nbnSP has nothing to with the actual NBN (which doesn't directly sell to customers) except for 3 letters in it's name.

And if this government is still in charge by 2021 I extremely doubt it will be at 90% of the population.
@_date: 2015-07-24 01:50:25
That is so stupid.
@_date: 2015-04-03 04:23:24
"fastest growing exchange on the planet" lol it just launched.
@_date: 2015-11-02 07:47:36
I wonder if it's too late to get into this ponzi, last 2 ponzis I got in early and made a good profit. It's fun investing in them when you know what they are and to get out quickly. Anyone know if it's to late to invest?
@_date: 2015-03-21 08:24:47
Maybe try a Trezor?
@_date: 2015-03-22 02:04:04
lol Trezor is no where near $500
@_date: 2015-03-19 13:50:54
Yeah it was extremely half assed attempt at it. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 01:45:46
yep just started using it, its a nice site.
@_date: 2015-03-04 09:14:54
Well, you're a bit of a fuckwit aren't you.
@_date: 2015-03-08 07:59:42
just throwing this out there, are you in the military or is one of your family members? damn sure seems like it.
@_date: 2015-03-31 00:21:14
Jesus, you're a fucking idiot.
@_date: 2015-02-17 03:33:16
Jesus christ, do you even know what you are talking about? you buy US propaganda easily I see.

Isn't it against Paypal's T&amp;Cs to have it on a porn site?

What? just because mega is in the name doesn't mean he had anything to do with it.
