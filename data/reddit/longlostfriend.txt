I buy some every payday and stash some in cold storage and leave the rest on Mycelium. I find myself using it at Gyft and eGifter (and, somewhat less often on Purse.io). 
I am more inclined to use the bitcoin for purchases when the USD price is noticeably higher than it was when I bought them. That way, I not only get the 3% rebate for using BTC to buy a gift card, but I make the BTC stretch a little farther. 
Yeah, one day I may look back on those purchases and say, "Man, if I had only paid for the groceries with cash and kept the bitcoins..." but the bottom line is that I *am* holding BTC elsewhere and only using a relatively small amount as a short-term savings strategy.

Other decentralized solutions offer that higher throughput already. Bitshares 2.0 is the fastest one out there, and a lot of exchanges have integrated with it already for that very reason. Then, there would be no need to bog down the BTC blockchain at all. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 06:37:56


Nonsense. By your thinking, every single exchange should be shut down because those trades are done off-chain as well. Off-chain transactions serve a purpose, and the fact that they are not recorded on the blockchains of their respective cryptos doesn't "defeat the point" of Bitcoin's existence.

2. It's worldwide. Touch on the computing power, spread all over the world that secures it.
Most importantly:
3. It's not going away, and ignoring it or trying in vain to ban it will just leave them strategically behind other nations that don't do those things. Encourage them to embrace and capitalize on something that is both good and inevitable.

You make a good point, but I am not talking about a single transaction here.
Let's assume that I make $60K USD a year. Over the course of a year, I buy BTC at various prices for a total of $15K USD. Over that year, I keep a third of the BTC and spend two thirds of it on everyday purchases of goods and services on a regular basis throughout the year. $10 here, $25 there, maybe a $1500 purchase once, etc. Doing the math, 1/6 of my annual income was spent via bitcoin on hundreds of items at various times when the exchange rate (as if there were a standard exchange rate) was at different levels almost every time I made each of those hundreds of purchases. What is the cumulative fair market value of the bitcoin I spent over the course of the year?
If I were trading stocks or options, there is a centralized exchange (NYSE or CBOE, for example), regulated by a centralized government entity (the SEC). That simply isn't how Bitcoin works, and no declaration made by the IRS is going to fundamentally change that.

Here's the problem I foresee with that. Let's say I use ETRADE for my brokerage account. All of my buys and sells are recorded there in one place. They generate a 1099-B that lists everything. The securities never leave the account unless and until they are sold.
Then let's say I buy most of my bitcoin from Coinbase, and I immediately withdraw the BTC to a private wallet. I never sell the coin back for USD anywhere, but use it to buy the things I need and want whenever the option to pay with it presents itself. Coinbase knows what I paid for the items, but it has no idea what I did with the coins once they are gone. They can't report anything on a 1099-B except a purchase on a particular date.

I don't recommend buying BTC from unknown individuals on the Internet. The face-to-face approach is far more secure, in my opinion. 
Multisig escrow does require a third party, but in a 2-of-3 signature transaction (the third signer being the escrow service), the company or any hacker cannot run off with your bitcoins. The only time the third party even becomes involved is when there is some dispute between the two people making the transaction. It's far superior to sending your BTC to LB and hoping that they are honest enough and secure enough to manage your coins properly.

It's not the same thing at all. That $10K USD *would* be reported to the IRS as USD income on my W-2. According to the IRS today, I would also be responsible for documenting what every satoshi was worth on some mythical standard exchange rate *every time* I bought any one of the hundreds of items I purchased with BTC throughout the year. That is burdensome to the point of being unrealistic.

This is a key question to answer. A couple of responses to that:
1. If the U.S. were to make it illegal, that does not mean that it will stop happening. How effective are they at stopping BitTorrent? And, whereas South Africa (and perhaps Kenya) may have strict currency controls, there are lots of African countries who do not have that infrastructure.
2. Rather than trying to get Bitcoin to play along with M-PESA, why not try establishing a "BTC beachhead" like Lagos, Nigeria? It is the largest city in the world, after all.
3. This is more me thinking out loud and securing input from other Bitcoiners, but how could we establish communities where bitcoin is exchanged within close-knit, agorist-style networks rather than converted to local fiat? I mean a case where a small, wired community buys and sells goods and services among themselves, using BTC as a medium, and seeing what external growth may come of that. Ideas?

Bitcoin is called a TRUSTLESS protocol for a reason. Paper wallets are not that complicated if you have enough money to make it worth it. Most of the BTC that has been stolen, in any case, has been taken from online exchanges and "bitcoin banks."
The minimum level of security that is needed is controlling your own private key. Never store your money anywhere where you do not have complete control of the spending of your money. If you use exchanges, clear out your accounts as soon as you are done trading for the day. Is avoiding a few minutes of conformation time and a minuscule fee worth the risk of losing EVERYTHING?

SOME are poor. It will take some time for BTC to make it out to the rural areas of the country, but in major cities like Mumbai and in tech cities like Bangalore, it will take hold almost immediately and gradually spread from there.

How is that fundamentally different than a company using Bitpay and taking the daily USD deposit? The company behind the card may not utilize the BTC themselves, but intermediaries like this keep the coins circulating.
I use Gyft and eGifter all the time for my purchases of regular items. That 3% adds up pretty quickly when I use Gyft to buy groceries, to eat out, and on deals from Groupon.

Yeah, this would be an alternative to those who don't want to fork over all of their personal info to Coinbase and keep their BTC purchases as anonymous as possible. To the rest of the world, it just looks like you are making purchases at Amazon. 
If you have Amazon Prime, it would likely be faster than waiting for the ACH from Paypal to your bank, too.
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:43:48
You misunderstand. I don't think it has anything to do with BitPay taking a political stand. It is in the interest of PR, in the same way that Coinbase distanced itself from a legal marijuana dispensary. 
They don't want to give FINCEN any reason to come in and shut them down, legitimately or not. You may call them spineless for doing so, but you aren't the one trying to (a) stay in business, (b) stay out of jail, and (c) provide a service that thousands more individuals use to stimulate the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:25:12
It depends on how you define "immune." Would the USA outlawing USD-BTC conversion have an impact on the BTC ecosystem? Of course. It wouldn't ruin BTC, even in the United States. 
There's still mining, not to mention all of the BTC currently held by Americans, not to mention the ability to convert, for example, from USD to EUR and then from EUR to BTC.
Anti-bitcoin regulation would be an inconvenience for Americans, but it wouldn't put a stop to anything essential. It cannot realistically be banned.

"Considering it's 2014 and we all expect to access our data wherever we are, the current solutions for Bitcoin storage are outdated."
Agreed. However, the fact remains that there are other ways to keep your BTC off an online wallet aside from using paper wallets or a PC. I use Mycelium (with the wallet backed up on paper) on my Android, password-protected, to access my BTC wherever I am. No one is going to get at the coins in my Mycelium wallet before I have the chance to move them somewhere else. That is a simple solution for the non-technical among us.
My point is that it is ultimately up to ME to keep my bitcoins safe. Don't trust strangers with your funds.

In addition, there would be a large group who would continue to use it simply as a matter of defiance against an oppressive, over-reaching policy.
Plus, since the realistic chances of you getting caught are pretty low if you cover your tracks well enough, people are not going to take laws like that very seriously. Some people get caught speeding. That doesn't keep most people from speeding. They will just say (and, for the most part, correctly), "It'll never happen to me."

I read a ton of comments and posts here touting that BTC is "pseudonymous" and "decentralized" and "frictionless." Those are key components of the protocol and should be promoted and explained. However, we do not do enough here to emphasize that the BTC protocol is a TRUSTLESS one. It is a feature, not a bug, and the community would do well to start handling their bitcoin accordingly.

One would only need a money transmitter license if is a [Money Services Business]( i.e. a company that converts from one currency to another. FinCEN, a bureau within the U.S. Treasury Department, considers bitcoins to be currency and requires companies like Coinbase to have a federal MTL.
But the IRS, a different bureau within the same U.S. Treasury Department, just stated that bitcoin is a property asset, *not* a currency, for tax purposes.
Therefore, the U.S. Treasury has taken an official position that bitcoin *is* a currency and that bitcoin *is not* a currency. There's your inconsistency.
While there is no "thoughtful answer" to this question yet, the good folks here at are certainly not the only ones who have noticed this. This inconsistency will be very publicly challenged by "Bitcoin businesses" and many bitcoin users, and the Dept. of the Treasury will eventually have to make a clear call one way or another.

I would argue that it *is* corporate hubris if Apple thinks whatever electronic payment system they are devising is going to shove Bitcoin aside. 
Anyone with any faith in the future of Bitcoin knows how this will play out: eventually Apple will relent and incorporate it in response to everyone else doing the same. The irony here is that Apple has long been known for embracing new technologies and implementing them in their products ahead of their competitors.
As an aside, I don't get the way some people conclude that someone complaining about Apple's BTC policy means that he thinks Apple doesn't have the right to do it. Those two are not the same thing. 
I am a free marketeer myself, and I don't like this policy. I do not dislike it enough, however, to put a few rounds in my iPhone (which I have owned almost twice as long as I have been into Bitcoin) and start over.

We *are* talking about the government, here...
A couple of observations. The distinction between "real" currencies and "virtual" currencies seems to be rather weak. I wonder how well it would hold up if challenged in a court. (yes, more armchair lawyering)
Secondly, by the FinCEN definition, if some country, such as Argentina or Zimbabwe, were suddenly to declare that bitcoin would henceforth be legal tender, it would instantly become "real currency." Not saying that this will happen, but the only one of those three criteria that bitcoin doesn't meet is the recognition of it as legal tender by any state.
Lastly, this has the potential of hindering the progress of Bitcoin in the United States alone. The long-term effects of this will be detrimental to the U.S. economy, not to Bitcoin. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency will flourish in nations with a freer attitude toward it, while the U.S. gets left behind.

Nonsense. The coins are mine once I fork over the money and they credit it to my account. I give them fiat, and they allocate BTC in their hot wallet to me. That is when the transfer to me took place (regardless of the fact that it isn't recorded on the blockchain). I can send it to an address belonging to someone else (which is analogous to what the majority of Western Union money transfers are for), or I can send them to another address belonging to me, which is like moving my own money from one pocket to another.

It's a little more nuanced than that, in my view. As the comments on this thread have shown, there are a lot of people who would spend their bitcoin, if only there were more places that accepted it. 
Let's say that the deli on the corner starts accepting bitcoin. I have cash and a credit card and a mobile wallet as I walk in the door. I know several things:
1. I, personally, prefer spending BTC, and look forward to the day when that is an option everywhere.
2. There are others who would spend bitcoin at this deli, but they may not yet be aware that the deli accepts it. These include not only regular customers who have not found out, but people who would start to frequent the deli specifically because it accepts bitcoin.
3. Most of the general public doesn't use bitcoin yet, and supporting a business that has taken the plunge with my purchases increases the likelihood that I will be able to have yet another example to answer, "Where can you even spend bitcoin?"
4. There is a symbiotic thing going on here, where businesses will continue to accept bitcoin as long as it is worth it to them (i.e. they get significant sales from it) and more people will adopt bitcoin as a currency if they see its utility (i.e. there are places they can use it). We are the early adopters, and I see it as my personal responsibility to do what I can to help adoption along.
In my view, bitcoin is one of those things that has been made available to the public before most of the public is even aware that they want/need it. Like the Internet 25 years ago, most people who were aware of it (outside of its creators and developers) said, "That's interesting, but how would I use it? I'll never need that in my life."
Widespread cryptocurrency adoption is coming, regardless of my personal spending purchases. I do like to think, however, that our collective efforts to stimulate the bitcoin economy will speed this process along.

Bitcoin, however, by its very nature, is subversive to government-centralized banking. There's no getting around that. Even bitcoiners who dot every 'i" and cross every "t" on their tax returns are using a technology that, by its very existence, challenges the hegemony of the government-backed currency.

Do you mine it? If so, did you record the exchange rate EVERY TIME that the mining pool added satoshis to your account? Which exchange did you use to determine *the* USD equivalent?

Let me put this into perspective, so that naysayers can at least get where I am coming from.
I am not a Bitcoin whale. Like the vast majority of bitcoiners, I do make regular purchases of Bitcoin and hold some, but I also spend Bitcoin on an almost daily basis. In other words, I use it as a *currency*. I almost never convert my BTC back into fiat, and I use BTC whenever I can for everything from meals to grocery purchases to entertainment expenses.
Does the IRS realistically expect me to record the exchange rate (*which* exchange rate, by the way?) of BTC-USD every time I buy a Domino's gift card at eGifter for $10? Since I buy BTC on a very regular basis, would I need to use FIFO or LIFO accounting for my purchases?
Whether it is the law or not, it is excessively burdensome to expect someone who regularly uses BTC as a currency to treat it as an asset like securities. And it is absolutely laughable to think of the IRS trying to do the necessary investigation to enforce this.
Bitcoin *is* a currency. The IRS saying that it isn't doesn't change reality.

The protocol itself can't be regulated. The (legal) use of the currency certainly can be. Just ask the Chinese.
Decentralized cryptocurrency is a brand-new paradigm, and you have to approach it with a brand-new set of rules. Unregulated currency is far from a stupid idea; it just requires less foolishness on the people who use it.
In other words, bitcoin isn't the problem. Lack of personal responsibility is.
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:39:00
Precisely. Cryptocurrency will not spell the end of taxation, but it will spell the end of income taxes and the IRS.
Speaking of which, do these rules apply to altcoins as well? How do I declare the capital gains from mining Zetacoin last summer? And when I exchanged 12000 ZET on BTC-e last fall for bitcoin, how do I record THAT?
The IRS has absolutely no idea the mess it has gotten itself into.

Let's also forget that Bitcoin is pseudonymous, and even if one doesn't use mixers or stealth addresses, the IRS doesn't have the expertise or the available man-hours to sift through the blockchain, determine what transactions are actually purchases and which ones are sales for fiat and which ones are simply me moving BTC from one wallet to another, or even tie a lot of my addresses to my identity. That is a practically impossible task for them.


Yeah, I am not talking about the Bitcoin whales here. Is it really worth it to the IRS to make sure that I declared capital gains on the $10 Chili's card I bought on Gyft? It certainly is not worth it to me to keep the kinds of records necessary to make sure that every cup of coffee or every book I buy on Amazon through Purse.io is a capital gain or a capital loss.
The thing that is going to leave the IRS with egg on its face is the mistake they are making in their premise. They can call it a property asset all they want, but there are people like me who do use bitcoins as a *currency* on a daily basis. And, as more people embrace it as a currency, there is no conceivable way that the IRS will be able to chase all of that data down.
Just for the record, I am not advocating using BTC as some kind of shield to cheat Uncle Sam. In fact, I envision that cryptocurrency will eventually force governments to abandon income taxes altogether in favor of flat consumption taxes. The bottom line is that the IRS cannot hope to widely enforce what it has declared today.

My tablet's a Nexus, so I wasn't left in the lurch last night.
Funny thing: I was a die-hard Apple guy even before the second coming of Steve Jobs. You can criticize the "stupidity" of Apple, but they were pioneers and innovators in every market they are in, whether it was creating something that had never existed for the consumer before or improving upon inferior products.
They've always been religious about controlling the "user experience" (almost never licensing their OS, developer guidelines for applications, etc.), but they had always given quite a bit of freedom to developers to create applications -- that is, before they had the market share that they now enjoy. 
I am pretty disillusioned by the level of draconian tactics they take with iOS.

I haven't even been counting mine, but my guess is that I have made close to that many this year already.


How did you determine which coins were spent on which item? For example, if I bought 1 BTC at 250 in September and 1 BTC at 650 in November, and then spent 0.5 BTC in December, What would be the cost basis for the capital gain or loss?


So, by logical extension, if I leave the coins on the pool forever, I never mined at all?
@_date: 2014-03-20 09:32:55


That's circular reasoning. If the use of bitcoin were made illegal, any purchases by definition would be illegal. 
That's why I am comparing your scenario to Prohibition. Without shutting down the Internet entirely, there is no realistic way to prevent access to BTC. And it would still "make sense" to use it for any purpose in which it is better than using fiat currency through centralized networks.

I spend mine all the time. I use [Gyft]( and [eGifter]( here in the USA to buy electronic gift cards for things that I cannot buy directly with Bitcoin (and with Groupon as one of the gift card possibilities, that opens up a lot more venues and deals for me to spend my bitcoin on). 
I have also used [Purse.io]( to purchase items off Amazon (and get Prime 2-day shipping without paying for it myself), and the service works really well.
I do buy and hold (or "HODL") some BTC, but I buy more than I intend to hold for a couple of reasons: to stimulate the BTC system and actually use it as a currency, and to benefit from upward price fluctuations. For example, if I bought bitcoin at 550 USD and spend them when the exchange rate is 630 USD, that's eighty bucks of goods and services I got for a couple of weeks' investment.
This method saved me several hundred dollars on my fiancée's engagement ring back when the BTC exchange rate was around 850 USD late last year.
tl;dr It's not a question of "buy and hold" or "buy and spend." You can actually do both.

Well, if you are skittish about bitcoin, they will pay you in USD or whatever your local currency is. You don't have to hold the BTC. That way, wther someone has to pay .510 BTC or .75 BTC to get your product or service, you still get the same amount of fiat currency.

One of the advantages of Purse.io is that you can choose your own discount. I bought a Mother's Day present with it using Bitcoin, got free two-day shipping, and got an exchange rate of 500 USD per BTC.
This price discovery feature is great, in my opinion. Yes, the transaction is mediated through Purse.io, but the buyer and seller ultimately decide how much they are willing to pay. And, at least for the time being, there are a lot of people out there willing to pay a premium to effectively buy BTC with their credit cards.

Not necessarily. A lot of merchants keep the bitcoin, being BTC users themselves.
The conversions into and out of fiat currency are commonplace now, because cryptocurrency doesn't have widespread adoption yet.

1. Don't buy it now if you are such a skeptic. You will be using cryptocurrency in your lifetime. It's already taking hold and will continue to spread.
2. What about banks and financial institutions [DECIDING how and when you will spend your money]( What about financial institutions that [decide to TAKE your money](
3. I like the fact that I do not have to trust anyone I do not choose to trust. Plus, all of the things you are describing are characteristics of credit cards, which aren't really assets to begin with. 
Bitcoin is effortless to use, and, despite the volatility, has gradually increased in time exponentially since its inception. If you don't think that will continue to do so, stay away from it. If you are happy entrusting your assets to a third party like a bank, be my guest. With the portion of my finances that are in bitcoin, I will be my own bank, spend it or donate it or save it as I please, and access it anywhere in the world with an Internet connection.
Lastly, if it isn't a viable payment method, why are businesses from start-ups to NYSE-listed companies starting to accept it? You may be of the opinion that it isn't viable. Seems like there are a lot of happy customers who take a different view on the matter.

Through the site, you are basically offering your BTC in exchange for someone sending you an item from your Amazon wish list. Purse.io is basically an escrow service between you and the third party. You can adjust your "discount" on Amazon's price by whatever percentage you desire, and then you wait for someone wanting BTC to accept your bid. You get a discount, and they get the benefit of essentially purchasing BTC anonymously with a credit card or Amazon credit. 
Price discovery at its finest.

Your situation sucks, but the takeaway from this is not that Bitcoin is inherently flawed, but rather that each of us is ultimately responsible for protecting our money.

The difficulty adjustment happens every 2016 blocks; it isn't actually measured in time increments. If China goes down, getting to the next  checkpoint at the present difficulty will take significantly longer.
Also, if I am correct, there is hardwired into the code a limit on how much the difficulty can go up or down when it changes. That would also add to the time it takes for the difficulty to come back down to  appropriate levels.

Hey, they were having problems with PayPal sells (may still be having them), so they cancelled my transaction and put the BTC back in my wallet
@_date: 2015-08-31 09:10:40
I did.
@_date: 2015-08-31 09:05:14
How do they know on their end when "bitcoin people" try to double-spend (unless they are successful at it, of course)?
I only noticed waving to wait for a confirmation at some point during the Great Transaction Spamming of 2015. I wasn't sure if there was a connection or not, but it would seem to make sense that they were not wanting to issue cards if a broadcasted transaction wasn't going to make it into a block for hours.
In any case, I don't harbor any resentment toward Gyft, but if I am wanting to use BTC to cover dinner and I am at a restaurant that does business with both eGifter and Gyft, I am not going to be waiting around unnecessarily.
@_date: 2015-08-31 01:42:52
I have stopped using Gyft as much since it began to wait for a confirmation to dole out the card. It is their right, of course, but I now use eGifter unless the business partners with Gyft exclusively. I grew used to obtaining the card at the point of sale and not waiting 10-40 minutes to be able to access it. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 09:45:36
I think that Gyft has started waiting for one confirmation now. This did not happen in the past, and eGifter still doesn't do that. That has cost Gyft my business when the retailer is also on eGifter.

Coinbase is the easiest way for me to buy and sell BTC instantly. I have used them for three years now without even a hiccup in the process. I don't keep my coins on there, but until BTC is an everyday medium of exchange for the general population, I don't mind giving in to an acceptable amount of risk for the few minutes it takes to insta-buy and send it to my private wallet.

@_date: 2016-02-01 13:31:03
Yeah, it seems that the private keys are not  human-readable on the Coinbase end, at least not without an unreasonable amount of effort. 
And since the BTC sent to that address is swept into a pooled account, there wouldn't be the miniscule amount of BTC at that address to even sign a raw transaction, I would guess. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 13:34:59
Counterparty *uses* the Bitcoin blockchain. And, unlike a lot of alts, SJCX actually serves a purpose within a useful application. It isn't just some hard fork off of Bitcoin with some parameters tweaked.

Well, if it doesn't pay off for them, they can always bring it back. This does mean that I will be looking at other electronic gift card providers for what i need before I head to Gyft, of course.

@_date: 2016-02-01 09:27:51
We used to talk a lot about "being your own bank" here before the block size debates started monopolizing the threads. It is a feature, not a bug; and I have fully endorsed the principle of controlling the keys for your cryptocurrency.
I still do, even when it costs me personally. Today, I accidentally sent 0.7 BTC worth of a Counterparty asset to an address owned by Coinbase. For those of you not in the know, Counterparty is a platform that runs on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, and the ledgers for CP tokens are derived from data embedded in the transaction data of bitcoin transactions.
Long story short: I would need the private key to that single address (containing nothing at this point but the dust needed to make the underlying BTC transaction happen) in order to sweep those assets back into my Counterparty wallet. Due to Coinbase's security, it looks like that will be impossible. Therefore, those tokens are effectively out-of-reach until the end of time.
Two lessons to be learned from this: 
1. The fuck-up is mine. I have no one to blame for this but myself. It is no one's job to bail me out of my own lack of paying attention to what I was doing. This is the reality of the new crypto economy, and the bottom line is that I need to be more careful in the future
2. For all of the frequent "Coinbase hating" that goes on here, their inability to help me is a testament to their high security standards. I still advocate keeping your crypto out of any address for which you do not exclusively hold the keys, but this incident makes me more confident that Coinbase users are not likely to get Goxxed or BTERed.

What about when the inventory is digital, such as MP3 files or ebooks?


The capital goods Bitshares needs is in my living room, and in the homes and offices of everyone who chooses to participate. I lend my computing power to make the business run.


Again, it is hosted by everyone in the world who is a stakeholder in the company.


DACs have those. They are not confined to a single country, and in many cases it isn't even necessary that their true identities be known to anyone in order for them to do their jobs.


DACs, being completely autonomous, have no assets that are not already distributed among the shareholders according to their stake in the company. There is no central Bitshares bank account storing funds that can be seized by "the government" (whichever single government you happened to be referring to).
Really, wrap your mind around it: a DAC only exists as *software*, installed on interconnected computers the world over. It is the actions of each of the users of that software, in their various jurisdictions in various parts of the planet at different times of the day, independently and asynchronously, that keep it in existence and running.

I promptly transfer that to Mycelium, which is my main hot wallet for purchases, as well as for occasional local trading. 
I use the Gyft and eGifter apps to buy gift cards with BTC as well. 
Zeroblock is used to keep tabs on the price.
I have Airbitz and Breadwallet and Blockchain on my device as well, but I don't use them that often.
@_date: 2015-02-09 05:20:09


Who are they? Who live where in the world? And who would be those 101 delegates at the time of the arrest? Users rotate in and out of the delegate list daily.


DACs, by definition, cannot have those.


Those "weird edge cases" will become more common as the technology is more widely adopted. 
The only point of failure for Bitshares is the same as that of Bitcoin: the threat of regulating or outlawing the gateways that convert fiat into cryptocurrency. Some governments are doing their best to regulate that, and that is proving to be a fool's errand. And, as Bitcoin takes hold, and as more suppliers of companies accept bitcoins and as employees around the world are permitted to receive their income in bitcoins, then the whole "gateway issue" will be moot.

The U.S. government could try to implement such a ban, which would be of questionable success. 
What would prevent someone in Great Britain or Chile or Germany or South Africa or Finland or Canada or China or Costa Rica from engaging in business with the DAC?
@_date: 2015-02-07 12:35:59
This is basically what [Bitshares]( does. You can "short" a bitBTC (or bitUSD, etc.), thereby bringing it into existence.
It's not fractional reserve banking, however, because the one who shorts the asset has to put up 2X the value of the bitAsset in collateral, and it is locked up in the Bitshares blockchain until that short is covered. Plus, the DAC will trigger an automatic cover if the market moves enough that the asset would be worth only a fraction of the collateral put up.


Not much at the moment, if we are talking about cryptocurrency. If we start using decentralized exchanges like Bitshares more (as we should), it *is* one way to represent the real-world bitcoins in a frequent trading scenario without having to constantly use a gateway to get the coins in and out. (To my knowledge, no one has solved the problem of how to store actual bitcoins on a decentralized exchange in an un-Gox-able manner.)
@_date: 2015-02-01 07:47:57
This is huge. To clarify: BitUSD is pegged to the USD in a decentralized manner, as are the other BitAssets to their non-crypto counterparts.
For those merchants and individuals who criticize BTC volatility as the reason for avoiding it, BitUSD has the potential to be their cryptocurrency. 
Transaction times on the Bitshares blockchain can be measured in seconds rather than minutes, and exchanges such as bter.com already have USD/BitUSD pairs if someone were to need a gateway back into non-crypto fiat.
Perhaps best of all for the new crypto user, [Bitshares' TITAN system]( completely replaces the need for long BTC addresses or QR codes by means of an untraceable username. This could be the best way to eventually get grandma using crypto.
(Disclaimer: I am a Bitshares AGS investor.)
@_date: 2015-02-07 19:10:47
No, this *isn't* how bitcoins are brought into existence. It is how a token market-pegged to the value of 1 BTC is brought into existence. As long as the peg holds (and how Bitshares manages that is beyond the scope of this post), it is the monetary equivalent of issuing new BTC. 
And the reason one would trust the Bitshares ledger is the same that you would the ledger of Bitcoin or Litecoin: an active, decentralized blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 11:26:26


Who would go about this, and how would they find out their identities and locations around the world to accomplish this? Everyone who makes this claim seems to assume that there is some delegate central office in Akron, Ohio, or something, where these people can just be rounded up and hauled off to the big house, and there is no one actually *competing* to immediately step in and take their places.


If I recall correctly, Larimer's comparison to Bitcoin mining had to do with the huge mega-pools that re-centralize, in effect, the whole mining operation. 
I do not venerate Larimer any more than I hold Satoshi Nakamoto to be a god, but the Bitshares team did a pretty good job of eliminating the need for the electricity resources for proof-of-work, while also avoiding a purely proof-of-stake model that makes it difficult for anyone but the earliest adopters or the very rich to earn a profit.
Decentralization is not an "on/off" type of thing; it exists on a continuum. DPOS is centralized in that only 101 computers at a time are building and maintaining the blockchain, but it is decentralized in the sense that those 101 people are voted on by the stakeholders in Bitshares and that many of them are replaced with some regularity due to this voting model.
@_date: 2015-02-09 01:01:45


Perhaps you are not understanding the term *decentralized*. There *are* no storefronts, the data isn't centralized anywhere (or, in another sense, it is centralized *everywhere*). They would literally have to go to every computer in the world running the DAC's software and confiscate them all.


Apply to whom? Again, taking Bitshares as an example (since you didn't before), the only "employees" of the DAC are 101 delegates who are voted in by those holding Bitshares. If they don't do what they are hired to do (i.e. produce blocks) or are disruptive in any way, they can be immediately fired in the same manner.
With a DAC, just like with Bitcoin, there is no single point of failure, no CEO to arrest, nor property to seize.

I do completely anonymous negotiation on the Bitshares DAC. The algorithms and the blockchain govern everything. I have absolutely no idea whom I am exchanging assets with, and it is completely irrelevant to my transactions. And the way that the DAC is designed, there is absolutely no way to look at the blockchain and determine which assets are in my own account.

Bitshares has been running a banking DAC for over six months. There is a music DAC to be unveiled next month to compete with Spotify, Pandora, iTunes, and the like; a gaming DAC in the works; and a voting DAC being planned as well. These will benefit both content creators and end-users, and will be released into the wild with their own blockchains.
@_date: 2015-02-15 23:59:55
It's not pure luck.
It is called not making yourself a target by leaving your crypto sitting around in a wallet to which you don't control the private keys. 
People continue to reject the Bitcoin paradigm of "my money, my responsibility." And things like this keep happening. If I were to have my BTC ripped off during the few minutes to a couple of hours that I release it to an exchange, I'd be unhappy, but I know the risks and would blame no one but myself. 
Nowadays, I am using Bitshares and shapeshift.io a lot more than bter and the like. It's decentralized, and I trust the bitUSD market peg and the Bitshares blockchain lot more than I do any third party.
