‘Died while traveling to India’ yeah I’d want to see the dude laying cold on the post mortem table before I believed that. He’s probably in the Maldives somewhere with a beer on the beach!

Dude bitcoin cash is gonna plummet down to $500 and bitcoin shall rise again stop FOMO’ing 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:31:34
Simple solution, cash out now and leave the USD somewhere safe but you can immediately buy large amounts of bitcoin with. Wait for the next crash (which will come) and then buy bitcoin at maybe 6-7k

So happy about this! I guarantee this will happen with the next coin that’s added to coinbase!

Does the media just post shit about bitcoin, wait for it to drop and the purchase a shit tone of it like chase bank did? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:32:13
Coinbase. It's the industry standard. Their fees are shitty but they have a reliable site, nice interface and a decent app!

Don't upvote this. I want people to be scared &gt; price drops &gt; We buy even more and we all profit later

Pics or didn't happen

Definitely no. Back to the drawing board for you buddy! Maybe at a max $4000-$4200 by Tuesday

That’s why the word HODL exists buddy

''Maybe it will, maybe it won't, you'll have to wait and see'' ^--- best answer EVER

Just either hold your Bitcoin or buy and sell! Simples 
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:26:36
LOOOOOOOOL I love bitcoin bro but it won't be that high 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:06:43
Knowing dubai as well as I do, I almost guarantee they will be overcharging for whatever they do. No blunt there fees will make coinbase look cheap! 
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:20:19
I though chase bank bought bitcoin @ $3000 which isn't a bad price? It's $4000 now
