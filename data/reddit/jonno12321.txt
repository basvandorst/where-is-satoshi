Dollar cost average. 
If you have $1,000 to invest in total invest $100 every day for the next 10 days.

There's your problem.

They will... once they have accumulated large amounts of it and the general publics yearly salary is barely .01 bitcoin

Wall got knocked down pretty fast.

Even if someone discovers a way to attack bitcoin and transfer bitcoins from any wallet to their own effectively giving them ownership of every bitcoin, bitcoin will be rolled back and updated so the same attack can't happen again.
This would still be a big blow but bitcoin would never go to zero unless every full node was destroyed.

There’s a wall of 200 bitcoins at $6500. 
But we are heading for that wall fast. 
*We hit the $6500 wall.

I am so out.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:03:24
Not a bad deal. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:02:00
You can always try. But who’s to say the minute you sell the price starts to rise?
Best of luck though.

Still better than the dollar

I used coinbase to buy Bitcoin and transferred it to a wallet and it took 15 minutes.
@_date: 2019-01-18 05:37:44
Are you sure? I thought even though you were buying on the main page you were still filling an order.
@_date: 2019-01-06 17:52:53
Yeah bitcoin is still far below its value.
It's just had a lot of downward momentum for the last year that's pushed it to what is now a bargain price, people are still uncertain, but now they are starting to come back.

May all your crypto moon.
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:44:55
I'm expecting sub $3000. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:21:06
I agree with everything you said. I just wish I knew what you meant.

So all someone needed to do was copy your 24 words and the money is theirs.
Did you ever leave your wallet alone?
Did you have multiple copies of your Seed words?
You said no-one knows your password, but you say you didn't use a 25th word? Are you referring to the PIN to use the Trezor?
Are you sure no-one at home knows the PIN?

$3950 now.
Doubt it'll fall lower than $3800.
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:40:46
So less than the rate of inflation?
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:04:06
I doubt we'll see the actual bottom until around May - July.
@_date: 2018-12-01 22:20:37
Hype and FOMO.
