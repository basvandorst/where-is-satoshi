Yes it would be pretty cool. Hopefully it will happen when the heavy users of the main chain move their transactions to the second layer.  At that point (and after optimising the first layer as much as possible) it will be more straightforward to calculate how big the blocksize really need to be. For now it's not that easy, as blindly increasing it will just cause people to carelessly use the first layer, and delay (or remove) their incentives to optimize their business.

I think due to how the onion routing model works, nodes will not be able to know how many hops happened before/after them. Which is pretty cool as it will keep the system quite anonymous. All the node knows about is the previous and next node, nothing else.

Well in that case call Bill Gates and lets shut this internet thing down.

The state of the smart contracts is stored offchain, which allows cat breeding apps to scale without bloating the main chain.

Then they help the dumb money get in, and then they short the shit out of it, hurting even their own clients, but profiting nicely themselves.

I noticed it because it's currently top 3 in the subreddit. But I understand your point. Can't expect everyone to change, so I will be the one leaving.

Oh shit, my smart contract bribe to miners not to fork was hacked. PLEASE FORK. ALL EXCHANGES STOP BTC TRADING IMMEDIATELY!

Who keeps upvoting these threads?
"Pizza worth $100M Lolz"  
"Mom threw away my hard drive"  
"Bought thousand of dollars worth of Bitcoin in 1994 but forgot about them until today rofl xD"  
Who cares? Surely there are more important things to discuss here. And by the way, $8 of BTC in 2016 are definitely not worth $520 today. At least get your story right

*&gt;Raj and Howard enter the room*  
**Raj: Guys you won't believe this - I found my old hard drive and it has more than 50 Bitcoins on it!**  
**Leonard: Wow, this is great, Raj!**  
*&gt;Penny looks up from her phone*  
**Penny: Uhmm guys..... What is Bitcorn?**  
*&gt;Roaring laughter from the audience, people falling off their seats*  
**Leonard: It's BitCOIN Penny, not Bitcorn..**  
*&gt;Sheldon interrupts*  
**Sheldon: It's a peer-to-peer decentralised digital currency, where transactions are verified by a set of nodes and recorded in a distributed public ledger called a blockch..**  
*&gt;Sheldon notices that Penny is not paying attention and looking at her phone again*  
*&gt;Laughter erupts once again, several members of the audience are on the ground and seeking medical attention*  
**Leonard: ..It's internet money!**  
*&gt;The studio is falling apart*  
**Penny: Riiiight...**  
*&gt;Penny rolls her eyes in a exaggerated way and looks at her phone again*  
**Leonard: ..and it's worth $7000 each..**  
*&gt;Penny drops her phone*  
*&gt;Everyone in the audience is now dead*  
**Penny: So you were saying something about taking us shopping, Raj?**

This is what my nightmares are made of. Can you try to contact the original devs on github, it seems they are still somewhat active
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:49:29


And you know this how?
Also, once set, it doesn't take much effort to maintain bitcoin donations. I doubt that was the reason it got removed.

Not bad, just got annoyed that the 'big block' Bitcoin Cash conference that refused to accept BTC as a publicity stunt got in there.

Thanks, this looks like an Eclair fork with a single dev working on it, but I will check it out if it can do all of it

Set up a website or some sort of service where you need to "check in" every month or so. If you fail to do it you are probably dead, so a script will automatically mail your private keys to your family.
