A free market is the best and most efficient market. As long as the two individuals in the transaction enter it voluntarily it is no business of anyone else.  If the government regulates bitcoin it will become similar to wall street.  There will be lobbyist competing for special interest looking for favorable regulations.

Also, this affiliate program has been really great. I included links to 2 btc ad networks I'm getting good results with Advertise the browser and earn if that is of interest for you. (Full disclosure they are affiliate links, I am using all these services and have had good had good results.
