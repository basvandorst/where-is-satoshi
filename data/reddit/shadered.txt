Yes, technically this game is already lost.    
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:39:14
Sure. 
First, the line still stands. $2200 is perfectly doable before the hardfork and called by Goldman Sachs which has a good chance to make it a self fulfilling prophecy. 
Second, OP was already scared by something like a $200 drop. The line was mainly to provide some perspective. 
Would've expected that to be pretty obvious.
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:01:38

"Yes, I very much doubt that it will activate via BIP91. That requires 80% miner support, but BitMain has much more than 20%, and they'll never willingly cause SegWit to activate because it destroys asicboost. The current signalling percentages are a result of BitMain trying to get people to think that SegWit is on the way in order to hurt BIP148's chances. (I think that BIP148 was doomed regardless, but it doesn't help when people are thinking that "segwit2x" will activate SegWit around the same time anyway.)"

I can guarantee you there will be a significant crash in the future. The more new money comes in the more weak hands are in the space. But it won't crash to $300 even in the worst case. Bottom for a worst case event is $1200-$1800.
But no one knows when it will crash. It could crash at $50,000 down to $15,000. It could crash in 2 weeks with the fork or in late 2018. It's completely unpredictable, imho.
The only sane strategy (if you don't want to gamble) is dollar cost averaging and long term holding.

Agreed, a paper wallet storage is more secure. But it's a pain in the ass to spend/transact.

They are moving away. It's called 2x. They follow an agreement because they need consensus.
Miners decide. Nodes must agree. If nodes don't agree miners can create a new network without the old nodes. The old network dies if most miners follow to the new network. 
Pretty misleading to say they don't decide anything.

The first website launched 1991. 1999 was still very early for the web. 
1999 web felt like stone age compared to now.
In fact, only ~50% of the world population uses the internet yet. 
There is still steady user growth for the internet itself.
Bitcoin just started. It's in its infancy.
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:21:23
Some people try to run a full node on a $30 raspberry pi. These shitty machines are already at their limit. 
Some people live in very rural areas with Internet speeds from 1999.
These two categories of people FUD the most. 
The biggest point against 2X is that the hardfork doesn't have consensus in the community. Mainly because core doesn't want it.
Chicken and egg problem: core doesn't want it because it's controversial. It's controversial because core doesn't want it.

Read again. Miners can do everything. But they need consensus between miners (so the old network dies). Nodes without miners are just a dead network. Meaningless. Nodes only matter as long as there are miners. 
Which chain will be called bitcoin is decided by the ecosystem. Mostly exchanges. If there is only one usable chain the choice is clear.

If all miners leave Bitcoin stops working. It doesn't even slow down, it just stops. 
The exchanges will just name the working chain Bitcoin and move on. 97% of users won't even know what happened anyway. While a few rBitcoin neckbeards will discuss how to revive the "True 100% Valid Bitcoin Chain(TM)".
In short, the ecosystem determines which chain is called Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:53:49
That's the usual naive viewpoint mainly based on pedantic semantics.
**By saying miners have no power you play down the 2X threat.**
Miners have no power. On the old chain. Which will be dead. 
Yes, it's the "real Bitcoin", every other chain an altcoin, blah blah.
 Wrong. 
If 100% of miners are determined to leave the chain the old chain stops. Yes, the old chain won't change the rules, in fact, it won't do anything anymore.


That is so wrong it hurts. The old chain will be valueless because it won't work anymore. The ecosystem will be forced to follow the new chain. I'm not talking about the dozens hardcore rBitcoin users. I'm talking about exchanges and the majority of casual users. They will call the 2x chain Bitcoin and move on, simple as that.
NOO, THEY WOULD NEVER DO THIS! WHY WOULD THEY DO IT? BECAUSE THE OLD CHAIN DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE, IN CASE YOU STILL DIDN'T GET IT.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:56:15


*only if all users actually adopt it which could take years. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:39:24
Nah, you just misunderstood what i wrote.


Really? You can't interpret words in another context? I meant miners need consensus between themselves to perform a chain-killing attack AKA agreement fork. That has nothing to do with the Bitcoin network consensus.


PoW change? That's just the same thing 2X is doing but from the Core side. If you think the Bitcoin ecosystem consists of 100% Core supporters you are wrong. Therefore you just created a second altcoin, congratulations.
So why would the exchanges call your altcoin Bitcoin instead of the 2x chain? 
The 2x chain got all the security and you just cheated all the honest miners out too.
90% of actual Bitcoin users don't know anything about Bitcoin politics. They will just follow the chain the exchanges list.
You have a point, but a defensive hardfork isn't a foolproof solution. That's where the problems start.
@_date: 2017-09-24 11:02:27
Stop spreading misinformation. 
Segwit only increases the blocksize if people use the new format. So far that's not the case.

There is just one problem:

@_date: 2017-10-04 18:43:48


And how does reality play into this? 99% of Bitcoin owners and users are excluded from the discussion because they can't or don't care about running a full node?
90% of users don't even know what 2X means and buy their Bitcoins from Coinbase. If you ask them they would probably answer that they want 2X which promises lower fees and reduced transaction times.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:07:16
Meh, too much circlejerk and infighting by both parties. I believe everyone wants the best for Bitcoin. Both sides have very valid points.
I'm against a controversial hardfork though. The funny part is if Core would agree the fork wouldn't even be controversial. But that won't happen so i'm strongly against 2x.
@_date: 2017-09-22 09:12:43

@_date: 2017-10-22 01:37:51
Oh boy. You've seen nothing yet. Look at historical charts. Big corrections are common and expected. It's only hyped up because the price is rising. Once this hype-cycle breaks the price goes into the gutter. If we trade below $4000 tomorrow that wouldn't surprise me in the slightest. If fork panic sets in i can easily see below $3000. And if 2X really does a nasty attack i can even see &lt;$2000, although not very likely.

Probably not. Wouldn't be that difficult to detect a fake and makes a rather big story.
I don't think the risk of buying a fake devices is that high, they are relatively costly to make and only have a niche audience. And once the story is out everyone will be extra careful anyway.
So from a scammer POV i doubt it's worthwhile. Doesn't hurt to be careful though.

The one listed as Bitcoin (BTC) on exchanges is the chain that will be bought. If Coinbase lists 2X as Bitcoin you can pack up and go home.

@_date: 2017-10-06 08:50:15
Your comparison doesn't really make sense, i didn't assume they store their Bitcoins on Coinbase. You know light wallets / hardware wallets?
Bitcoin is slowly going mainstream. The ratio between full-node users and non-node users is growing every day. Today you may still get away with it but i'm 100% sure stating non-full-node users are not Bitcoin users will make you look really, really foolish in 5 years.
In the end not miners or nodes matter but the economic majority, especially if it becomes overwhelming mainstreamy.

has come a long way. It was ok at first because of the censorship but it's like a worse now.

Uhm, looks like he doesn't work there since 1996. 20 years ago. Coincidence.
Someone should ask the SGI director about the letter. Maybe it's 100% fake which would be pretty much hard evidence that the supercomputer doesn't exist and CW is not SN.

Uhm, because gmx is a shady shit of an email provider. They do whatever they want.
@_date: 2016-05-04 15:06:49
This is wrong because there is no trust anymore. The trust document states if kleiman should die the coins will be transfered back to CW after 15 months. Which is the case.

Really should be 9000 for max unconfirmed txs.

Breaking the agreement? Price will crash completely because future collaboration between miners will be impossible.

Uhhh, I think this thread is not about bad advice. Blowing it all on ETH was the best advice anyone could receive.

You still want the laminated paper for the wallet backup. Hardware wallets are useful if you also want to send bitcoins occasionally. They provide a secure environment, you don't need an offline pc to sign transactions.
You can do almost the same stuff with an offline raspberry pi. They are mainly time savers and are wildly popular because no one cares about $100 anymore at current bitcoin prices.

Ok, best advice in the last two years with exception of last month.

Wow, sorry for your loss. Do you know the infection cause?

Once upon a time there were more big-blockers than small-blockers in Certain people didn't like that and started banning big-blockers.
As a result was created. They shouted "no censorship!" but without any moderation it went to shit in just a few weeks. is now filled with legit exiled big-blockers but there are also a huge amount of trolls and conspiracy nutcases which would get rightfully banned in any decently moderated forum.

Don't send him money. It's probably a fake story. People fall for this shit every time... 
@_date: 2017-06-04 11:50:52
Because not everyone has &gt;$100k in Bitcoin and doesn't care about $1?
If Bitcoin drops use cases other coins will take them gladly.

Yeah, it was hard not to catch, had a good laugh. Must've been hard for the others to keep it together. I mean many people already suspect him to be Satoshi and he does exactly that slip of the tongue.

Wow, when did you buy it? a 1080TI is only like 0.24 BTC at the moment?
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:16:28
Look at his comment history. He posts about UASF as if it was his job. Maybe it is...?

r/btc already got Craig Wright.
Szabo only designed bitco.. bit gold.

ding ding
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:57:45
Yes, in fact there is a chance it will go way higher than a mere $10k.

I had the same concerns but if you think about it it isn't very realistic.
To counterfeit a device is costly. And if either
1) you sell to a overly concerned customer who checks firmware integrity and looks at the chips
2) you steal money from one person
happens, your plan is already busted and it will all over the bitcoin news and everyone knows there are counterfeit devices. Just doesn't seem worthwhile.
