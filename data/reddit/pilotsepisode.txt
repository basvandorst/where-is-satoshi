who’s buying for Wednesday?
@_date: 2019-07-28 17:55:53
You won’t have to worry bro you’ll be wiped out by then because ����
@_date: 2019-07-28 18:14:07
I’m talking about the shorts you probably have in prep of FOMC ����

@_date: 2019-06-29 19:30:32
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:11:40
I negotiated. Apparently he thought that since it was an older version of the coin that it was worth less.

Finally bought in. Got a steal too. I managed to get this guy to mail me a bit coin for only 9k LMAO. Instant 3 grand in my pocket.
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:26:52
He put the bit coin in a secure package.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:48:41
Well one thing is for certain: it’s either gonna go up, or down.
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:41:07
Btc is like gold, they both rise when the market shits itself
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:28:04
That’s probably shooting for the lower end. I could see it hitting 8600 briefly tonight, it’s definitely surpassed 8k and it’s only a matter of time before 9. Remember what happened after it passed 7, it just has to get past that new threshold which it’s finally done
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:06:38
New sticking price, can’t see a dip coming under 8150 today, 8400 by EOD
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:22:43
Seriously, there was a 400 dollar drop within 60 seconds
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:07:51
Go for it!
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:20:22
This is fucking insanity, am I delusional or are we going to 9k tomorrow? My vote is delusional
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:53:30
Hold my friend! It’ll all be worth it when you’re in the green!
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:02:08
Got out at 7950 earlier, this shit is too damn slow
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:21:04
Don’t look now but that bitch on a run
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:46:38
10k incoming bitches
@_date: 2019-05-19 05:26:23
10k incoming... imagine panic selling
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:59:40
I hope you wake up and invest in something with actual upside that moves naturally and predictably, nerd
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:39:26
It’s about to moon. 8500 by end of day I bet.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:18:13
LMFAO, so what it hit 8100, not going lower for any substantial amount of time. Only lasted about three minutes anyways
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:39:38
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:20:44
Show me 8300
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:08:16
Can we get an F in the chat
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:01:35
What the fuck is happening
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:21:43
It’s inevitable, average people are buying into the hype now
