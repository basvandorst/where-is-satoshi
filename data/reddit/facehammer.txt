It was an argument in favour of central banking because central banks don't tend to disappear with a substantial fraction of all the currency that will ever exist. 
Central banks save an awful lot of people, since one of the consequences of inflation is that debts become less valuable over time, rather than growing forever far beyond the debtor's ability to ever pay off. 
Central banking doesn't stop you losing money on a bad business decision, but it does give you the option of making the safest investments, with a guaranteed (but low) return, and the best possible protection of your money, including insurance. 
Literally economics 101. Pick up a book some time.

Congratulations! You've cottoned on to the second lecture of Economics 101: that money is debt (specifically, that money represents the promise of future value), since no-one cares about money that represents resources that have already been exhausted or labour which has already occurred.

@_date: 2014-05-12 21:04:58
No, that's not what I'm saying at all, dumbass.
The value of a dollar is less than it was 100 years ago, meaning that the principal value of a debt incurred 100 years ago is that much less. Generations of people who weren't born into debt-slavery thanks to this feature of central banks ought to be pretty fucking grateful, wouldn't you say?
Money is only doing what it is supposed to do when it's *moving around the economy*. What good to anyone is a gold bar buried in your backyard, a bunch of bills stuffed under your mattress, or a buttcoin stashed in a safe deposit box? Absolutely none. A low rate of inflation discourages this sort of hoarding behaviour in favour of *investment*, which leads to a healthy economy where all of capitalism's happiest of happy horseshit can actually happen.
Economics. One. Oh. One.

I doubt Warren Buffet is going to end up living on the street because his home got foreclosed any time soon. What you're probably thinking of is buying debt as an asset. If you buy debt as an asset, someone else owes you. You're not taking on debts to someone else yourself; that would be retarded, especially if you're as rich as Warren Buffet and could easily afford to just pay directly.
I'm angry - as far as anyone gets angry in response to wrong opinions on reddit - because you're profoundly ignorant of the subject at hand, yet acting like you understand it a lot better than most.

No, inflation is not theft, nor is it immoral. You don't understand what money is or how it works. Pick up a goddamn book. 
The great thing is that while you're railing against inflation and fucking around with your toy economy, you're insulated from the downsides of deflation by the fact that bitcoins are too small and ineffectual to ever make much of a difference to anything. You're benefiting from living in an economy with inflationary money whether you like it or not!

Yes, you're benefiting from a deflationary system that functions within an inflationary framework. You still, for example, measure your gains in terms of dollars. It's honestly pretty funny.
Bitcoins are tiny little joke of an economy. They're good for some middling scams and some light money laundering, and fuck all else. 
Make no mistake, though, I *love* bitcoins! They're such a perfect storm of idiocy, paranoia, incompetence, drama and bullshit that I just can't get enough of them and their community. 
@_date: 2012-12-31 14:29:20
Nope! You really ought to look into game theory and the iterated prisoner's dilemma some time. Individuals doing what suits them best usually results in the *worst* overall outcome, not the best. 
Also, bitcoins *aren't* infinitely divisible. They are divisible to 8 decimal places. You can't claim that they are infinitely divisible in the future just because they *might* be in the future! I *might* live to be a hundred years old, but if I claimed to therefore be a hundred years old today, you would rightly call me a liar and a retard.

@_date: 2012-12-18 23:28:02
Right, you asked for it. You're a fucking idiot. Inflation reduces the value of debt over time, making it ultimately easier to pay off than it otherwise would be. The poor are *far* more likely to be in debt than the rich; after all, those with money lend it out, rather than taking on debt themselves. Inflation therefore, on the whole, benefits those with little to no wealth.
Go on, tell me how that's wrong, besides "HURR DURR MY MATTRESS STASH IS WORTH LESS NOW"

It's almost like how your decentralised currency uses the exchange rate at a single exchange to determine the rate for everyone else! 


Most of the hardware and all of the electricity required to run the bitcoin economy is purchased with inflationary money. Those parts and that power are delivered to your house through companies and government agencies that operate in a system of inflationary money. Almost none of the participants make a living in bitcoins, or are even paid primarily in bitcoins, but earn most of their wealth in worthless inflationary fiat paper. When someone scams all of your coins off you, you don't hesitate to call the FBI, who are funded with inflationary money raised by - [gasp] - taxation. Not one part of the bitcoin economy, as it exists today, could exist without the infrastructure of an inflationary economy. 
It's hilariously, almost unbelievably dumb of you to try to argue otherwise. That's another thing I find so fascinating about you: even as your own system demonstrates how monumentally wrong your whole ideology is at its very base, you *still* act so fucking smug about it all! It's just precious. 


Congratulations. Seriously, well done. You sure picked the right Pump n' Dump pseudo-commodity to throw your savings at. 
Last week, I put everything on red and walked out of the casino with my wallet twice as full as when I came in. Performance like that is not to be scoffed at! It's hundreds of times better even than bitcoin! In fact, I've got an excellent investment opportunity, if you're interested!

Why should society reward you for stuffing cash under your mattress? It's not difficult to find an investment that at least keeps pace with inflation. Keeping your money in a bog-standard bank account would have been enough, and then some. If you're too dumb to manage that, that's your own fault.

I dunno, do they do something more productive with their money than hiding it?


So what about the inherent problem of early adopters holding most of the coins? There are people out there who mined tens or hundreds of thousands of coins back when mining cost almost nothing. Could anyone who started today do the same? Not a chance.
@_date: 2012-12-17 16:10:11
It's a waste of effort to break the cryptography, since it's so easy to steal peoples' coins or fuck with the bitcoin economy in other ways. 
The NSA could fuck the network over big time simply by letting its computers mine for a while, and then stopping. The difficulty would soar, and then when the extra power is removed, would take weeks or months to come back down, even if everyone currently mining persisted. Meanwhile, transactions aren't getting processed.

Without a shadow of a doubt. 
There are two factions in play within this hilarious little microcosm of lunacy. There are the True Believers, who want bitcoin to remain at a stable value. Then there are the speculators, who want the price to fluctuate wildly. These guys need not be affiliated with Wall Street in any way - they're in all likelihood just amateurs and opportunists. 
Any time a speculator makes a buck on the back of a price hike, that buck ultimately comes from some dumbass True Believer. Frankly, I am shocked - SHOCKED - that an unregulated market would produce such an outcome.

No, it's just almost entirely libertarians who like bitcoins, which is a libertarian implementation of a libertarian ideal.
A decentralised forum is, uh, something of a contradiction in terms. And would also amount to an entirely unregulated forum, which is a fucking stupid idea, especially when its subject matter is itself primarily a facilitator of illegal activities. 
Oh, and need I comment on the irony of a decentralised currency building up an unaccountable, Orwellian monopoly on exchanges? Hahaha, you couldn't make this shit up!

Libertarians care about freedom for precisely as long as it takes to become petty little fascist dictators of their own domain.

I suppose so, yes - especially given that buttcoiners so often just hoard their precious coins. But I guess it's an investment, of sorts: a coin that still exists can increase supply (and therefore lower demand, and thus coin price) at some indeterminate point in the future, but a coin that's gone is gone forever.

@_date: 2011-11-22 09:26:55
The sole legitimate trader on bitcointalk was the guy who ran BitGems. It's relevant because he, like me, was comedically invested in seeing bitcoin fail. It's relevant because the only legitimate trader on the official forums didn't even want the project to succeed. It's relevant because he so casually destroyed the libertarian idea of the perfectly informed consumer. 


No, it's a scam like any other. Early investors fleece suckers who join later. Suckers join later because they think they're early investors who can fleece more suckers later. 


Indeed. It's the fault of the community. The human element that libertarians never so much as think of. 
So, is bitcoin a currency or is it a commodity? If it's a commodity, your argument would hold. But in that case, it's a commodity based on wasteful make-work. If it's a currency, it's laughably unstable. 


We already have that, though. We have for some time, in fact. It's called the pirate bay.

Amazingly enough, crackpot, I don't spend every waking hour plotting your downfall. You see, I actually have shit to do. 
I'm reading right now all about how your wondrous free market currency of the future steadily sank in "value" from more than $20 per buttcoin all the way down to about $5 or $6 over the course of a few weeks a while back. Oh, how I laughed along the way. The market crash caused by a single fraudulent transaction. The ludicrous lack of security resulting in the mass password leak. The dwolla chargeback scams that left Mount Cocks half a million in the hole. Tradehill storing data as floats. Vegetta's meltdown after getting schooled by a woman with actual knowledge of what he was trying to do. The guy who got brain damage from running his mining rig in hot weather. El Show de Bitcoin. Open ponzi schemes (even named as such) in the forums. The third largest exchange being wiped off the face of the Earth because its owner was too stingy to buy permanent storage from amazon, and too dumb to make backups on another machine. MyBitcoin making off with a small fortune. 
What stands out most of all from this is that the system itself has worked perfectly throughout; all this hilarious drama and scamming has come exclusively from the libertarian idiocy you neckbeards so adore. Free Market, bitches!

I'll come clean. I'm part of a well-funded international agency dedicated to the destruction of bitcoin. Its threat to the status of my employers is unacceptable; as such, specialists like me were assigned to a task force whose mission is to ensure its banishment to an irrelevant core of fringe extremists, in order that it will never pose any serious challenge. 
@_date: 2011-10-25 17:01:14


The steady, months-long decline towards zero?


Remember we're talking about an inherently deflationary currency here; a currency with a rigidly fixed maximum number of coins. People at the time of the bubble (and some even today) predicted that buttcoins would inevitably sweep aside all opposition, replacing all worthless fiat currencies. If this happened in the US alone, each buttcoin would end up worth tens of thousands of dollars. 


Because most currencies are predominantly used for things that are not illegal, while bitcoin's growth is largely based on things that are?

You would have an excellent point, if you were in fact talking about a few outliers in a mostly sane community. Unfortunately for you, and hilariously for me, nothing could be further from the truth. 
The main (practically only serious) exchange is shady as fuck. The official forums are rife with the most amazing variety of insane and revolting opinions. Why do you think mining rigs need $10 000 of GPUs to generate coins at any remotely useful rate? Because every other fucker with a mining rig is willing to sink the same ridiculous amount of money into it. 
Why was the only legitimate trader in bitcoins a Freemason/SomethingAwful troll? Why did the admin of the official forum advertise an (openly named as such!) ponzi scheme in his signature? How much have the victims of the mybitcoin.com swindle got back? What happened to all the money people who bought in at $30 per coin put into the system? 
Why is a scam-laden currency that can lose half its value in ten minutes, that's based through and through on a philosophy of 'fuck you, I got mine' going to change society in any desirable way, even if by some dark miracle everyone started using it tomorrow?
I've spent weeks reading about this shit, son. It's been a wild and crazy ride and I've laughed long and hard every step of the way. I probably know more about fucking bitcoins than everyone else in this thread by now.

@_date: 2011-11-21 20:29:23
Ah, the other exchanges. Those things are priceless. Let me think. 
There was the exchange run on an Amazon virtual machine. Its owner was too cheap to drop ten bucks on permanent storage, so when he switched it off to "upgrade the RAM," everything on it was lost forever! Hilariously, he *did* make backups... on the same instance. 
Then there's tradehill, which can handle a tenth of MtGox's volume, if it's a *really* good day. 
Oh, and then there's the various other exchanges which have cut and run with everyone's money, or had their bank accounts frozen, or succumbed to other variety of breathtaking incompetence. 
MtGox, shady as it is, is the only real player in the exchange game. MtGox, which freezes accounts on a whim, in all likelihood puts up fake buy walls to keep the price high, and has no accountability or transparency whatsoever.

@_date: 2011-10-03 22:57:02
Oh, you don't know the half of it. It is the most delightfully insane thing I've seen in a *long* time. 
There's [an excellent thread]( that covers basically the entire thing on Something Awful. It's a whopping 600 pages long, but it's absolutely heaving with comedy gold. [Buttcoin.org]( has a good tl;dr of the first big crash. 


This is supposedly anonymous, though in practice it's not all that difficult to trace. Individual wallets are anonymous, but transactions are by design publicly visible. This makes them traceable through a bit of simple detective work. Incidentally, their anonymity and inability to chargeback is behind so much of the hilarious scamming that I mentioned.


Oh, you're getting it. Mining is exactly what you think it is; back at the start, mining new coins was easy, because they were "worth" almost nothing, so the dfficulty of mining them was low. When reddit's legion of neckbeards flooded in and inflated the bubble, though, miners went insane. The difficulty of mining increased hugely, and people started spending thousands of dollars on banks of top-of-the-line graphics cards and sucking up huge amounts of electricity to uselessly crunch numbers. One guy ran a rig that kept his room toasty warm through the winter all on its own, but when spring came, he ended up passing out from heat exhaustion and receiving minor brain damage. As the bubble slowly died away though, a few True Believers kept on mining away, even though they were actually operating at a loss by that point. I heard it described as a very clever bit of computer science used to do something utterly retarded.
This has been, in a way, an experiment - an experiment in which, for the first time, libertarianism was actually implemented in the real world. Perhaps the most surprising thing to come out of this was just how utterly predictable all of these outcomes were. 
@_date: 2011-11-10 09:20:20

Seriously though, bitcoins are *fascinating*. Watching this weird little ecosystem spring up over the last couple of years has been a real eye-opener to things I would never have given a second glance to before, and has refined my thinking on other things I already had some passing interest in. 
Electrical engineering. Psychology. Gambling. Economics. Netsec. Financial regulation. Monetary policy. Computer chip design and fabrication. Game theory. 
Bitcoin has been an education on all of these, and more. It was an education on what *not* to do, sure; but that can be every bit as valuable as an education on what *to* do. 
And hell, it's been a rollercoaster ride of comedy, too! Utterly transparent and resoundingly effective scams. Breathtaking incompetence. Impotent internet rage. Poetry. Rap videos. Shoops. Hacks. Have you ever watched a man try to create top-quality 99% silver ingots by melting together a bunch of scrap, then wailing on it with a hammer? Or a nasally-voiced dude cool a computer cluster by kicking over a dewar of liquid nitrogen onto the carpet next to it? Or a grown adult spend hundreds of dollars to put My Little Pony gifs next to the names of everyone he got into an internet argument with? 
I genuinely believe that bitcoins are both one of the funniest things our civilisation has ever produced, and a superb working example of how libertarian ideas crumble at the first contact with reality.

When you put it like that, it almost looks like the communists were on to something!
Fact is, there are only going to be a certain number of bitcoins produced in a given period of time, due to the way the system works. If you mine at the same rate as everyone else, you're going to get the same share as everyone else (Yes, I know it's more like entering a lottery than being given a definite reward, unless you're mining in a pool. Bear with me). Now are you going to, on the whole, benefit more if you can get at that share by running a program in the background on your spare laptop, or if you've got to drop $15000 on all the graphics cards you can get your hands on and $400 every month in electricity?
Let's say you got into mining right at the start. You download the client and fire it up, and start mucking around with this swell new space-currency of the future. You pull in a trickle of coins from mining. But you want to get more, so you run several computers. You get that many more coins per block, everyone else gets that many fewer to share between them. If everyone else wants to get the same number of coins they were getting before, they've got to mine on multiple computers too. The difficulty goes up. The cost of mining goes up. The rate of coin release remains the same. Participation has got more expensive for exactly the same return. 
That's a textbook tragedy of the commons; and if that isn't the pinnacle of "inefficient and counterproductive", then I really don't know what is. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:28:24

@_date: 2013-08-22 19:49:50


Oh no, it would - though not for the same reasons, and over a much longer time frame. It happened in the case I described because the price suddenly, massively hiked; but if a nation of millions of people were all using bitcoins, the value of the coins would both fail to keep pace with the expansion of the economy, and would also suffer a gradual attrition as people die and don't pass on their keys, lose their coins to hard drive crashes, just occasionally have them disappear into the aether forever mid-transaction, and so on. And in that case, the consequences would be rather more severe than some nerds being out of some weed money. 
Of course, this is actually a pretty minor problem compared to some of the others that would arise if a nation of any significance tried to adopt bitcoins. But I digress. 


I'm inclined to think that it's a problem with their concept of money. That sounds ridiculous at first, but when you think about it, the concept of money is surprisingly non-obvious and counter-intuitive. In reality, money is the promise of future value - a guarantee, backed by the power and security of the state, that you will be able to exchange this otherwise worthless bit of paper for goods or services in the future. The state uses inflation as an encouragement towards investment, ensuring that money remains in circulation, that the economy keeps working productively, and therefore that the money remains good for that promise of future value. In this view, inflation is at worst a small price to pay for the maintenance of an active economy. 
Libertarians, though, see money as a store of accumulated value - a thing that should be valuable in and of itself. In this view, anything that decreases the value of money is inherently wrong and blasphemous. Note that the bitcoin network is often claimed to work on this basis: that the value of coins is backed by the amount of computational "work" needed to produce coins. In reality, though, money based on accumulated value is a terrible idea, because nobody cares about past value - only for what they might be able to trade it for in the future. Imagine, as a wild hypothetical, a new system of money (somehow) created by a guy digging holes in the ground until new coins are produced. Well, great, but so what? Nobody can do anything with that. Now if a system of money were created in which a coin could be exchanged for someone heading off to the site of your choice and digging holes where you want holes dug, then you've got a practically useful currency, since it can be exchanged both directly for hole-digging services as you require, and for other goods and services with others who want to get holes dug themselves. 
Since libertarians don't - or won't - understand that, though, you won't ever see any implementation of inflation, or sane monetary policy of any kind really, in the world of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-01-05 23:33:16
Or, you could develop a bitcoin fork that's specifically coded to only mine on CPUs. There's already been at least one attempt at that, from what I've heard.
Congratulations on beating the shit out of those strawmen, though! This was never about "trust".

I have just one question for you, Mr Titor.

[You *really* ought to pick up a history book sometime]( The world has seen currencies deflate all the damn time. And it always turned out so awful that measures were taken to avoid it happening again in the future. 
I mean, just look at all those banking panics that happened before the Federal Reserve was created to sort this shit out. Honestly, I think watching the Ron Paul End the Fed buttcoin community gradually bow to reality and implement their own equivalent of the Federal Reserve is going to be the most exquisitely hilarious thing I'll have seen for years.

@_date: 2013-08-22 07:51:53


There's history. Deflation has occurred in the past.
Invariably, deflation has meant that those with sufficient wealth to let most of it sit around and appreciate have done so, rather than investing it, because why on Earth wouldn't you? Investing is risky, and you could probably make nearly as much by just stashing the cash under your mattress with virtually no risk whatsoever. 
If you aren't sufficiently wealthy to do that, though, you're not looking at having a good time of it. As the economy stagnates (due to no-one investing in businesses, or spending at all if they can avoid it), you're ever more likely to find yourself unemployed and having to take on debt simply to eat. And because debt gets more valuable over time, you probably won't be able to pay it off within your lifetime. 
Oh, and yes, this has actually occurred within the timeline of bitcoin's existence too. Needless to say, it came as a complete surprise to the bitcoin community, and nobody stopped for even a moment to consider that perhaps deflation wasn't so wonderful after all. 
So a deflationary economy is great if you're lucky enough to be one of those with sufficient wealth to take advantage of it, but awful if you're not. It's basically a reversion to feudalism.

Its community has essentially rediscovered some of that knowledge through trial and error, yet amazingly has *still* often failed to learn anything from the process.

It's pretty funny how bitcoin is either a booming currency of tomorrow or a "fledgling market" depending on exactlywhat you're trying to argue. 
As it is though, it's a damn near perfect model of free market capitalism. You have no government, no oversight, no taxes, no regulation, no central issuing authority, not even any chargebacks. People are free to do just about anything they want with their currency; security is in their own hands, investment is open to anyone who can muster the coins, and their worth is determined solely by what people are willing to exchange for them at any given moment. 
And what do you get?
A repeat of the most fun bits in the history of real money, of course! Boom and bust! Pump and dump! Short selling! Futures trading! Scams! The financial sector coming to dominate the economy! Overwhelming wealth inequality! Money laundering! Centralisation! Demands for regulation and personal identification! Police! Pointless Red Queen races! Iterated prisoner's dilemmas! Tragedies of the commons! 
Honestly I'd say it's a stunningly comprehensive model of capitalism that everyone with even the slightest interest should read about, even though all this was already utterly predictable from examining the rest of history.

There were numerous periods of deflation in the earlier parts of US history, before the Federal Reserve was specifically set up to rein that shit in. Not having actually formally studied economics or US history, though, I can't really go into any more historical detail than that. 
What I can talk about, though, is the time it happened with bitcoins. It was spring this year; for some 6 months, the bitcoin-real money exchange rate had stayed relatively stable, and some people had taken out bitcoin loans. In about April, though, the coin price suddenly began to rise very rapidly, from something like $10-15 all the way up to $250 (before a precipitous crash from which I had many a belly laugh). 
Naturally, the people who had taken out loans to the value of a few tens to hundreds of dollars were terrified to now find themselves owing a quantity of coins worth an order of magnitude more than the value of their original loan. They tried to persuade their creditors that they should accept repayment to the original dollar value of the loans. Of course, the creditors were having none of it. 
Meanwhile, those who happened to have amassed great hoards of bitcoins looked on smugly while their potential value continued to increase. They didn't invest any of their coins into the businesses that were being started up (though given the heady mixture of shadiness, incompetence and delusion involved in the entire affair, perhaps they can't be blamed for that); just sat on their coins and waited to get richer.

As a miner, you don't make *any* money anymore, unless you live somewhere you can get power for less than most people pay, or unless you've conned someone else into paying for it. This is less a Tyler Durden and more a Tragedy of the Commons. Everyone would unquestionably have a much easier time of mining - and, most likely, many more newbies would take the plunge - if only everyone made an agreement not to get ahead at others' expense. 
Yeah, I get that this absurd arms race prevents double-spending (for what it's worth though, I understand one of the mining pools regularly approaches 50% of the network, rendering this precaution of dubious worth in any case), but is it *really* necessary to devote more computational power to this than is dedicated to several of the world's other biggest supercomputing projects *combined*? I saw figures a little while back that put a conservative estimate of the amount spent on mining per year, in its current state, being in the same ballpark as the whole bitcoin economy up to that point.

Bitcoins are wildly unstable. In the last week or two, they've gone from just over $15 per coin, up to $19, and then back down to $16.

That's not what makes gold deflationary. Gold is deflationary because the rate it's dug out of the ground compared to its value doesn't (and historically didn't) match pace with the rate the economy grows at. You would think someone as well versed in economics as you are would know that. 
As it happens, though, the problems with deflation of gold would only be made *worse* by the fact that the maximum number of bitcoins are only going down. It's really something when you not only reinvent the problems of the gold standard, but actually magnify them!

You misunderstand. The problem isn't that it is illegal. The problem is that its piddling volume of transactions is already enough to seriously clog up the system for everyone else. To steal an analogy:
Imagine the bit-economy as a circle of houses, with a pond in the middle of that circle that you both get water from and dump sewage in. At first it's not bad, because it's a big pond okay, but you keep agitating for more people to move in and make their own houses in the circle and dump their sewage into the pond, because it makes property values go up.
Then one guy - let's call him Erik Voorhees - shows up and says "How much does it cost per gallon of sewage? Okay, cool", hands the collective homeowners the requisite amount of cash, and starts piping in sewage from a nearby waste treatment plant.
Suddenly, your bathwater's starting to taste pretty shitty, and that's not too cool. I mean, you probably knew and ignored the fact that sooner or later, with enough people moving in, this was going to happen anyways, but this one guy marred your libertarian utopia with his shitwater too early. So you say you want to cut off the guy's pipe even if he did pay the fees for it, but your group is split between people who really don't want shitwater, and people who also don't really want shitwater but they don't really want to not get money more so they're kind of okay with it, and also they knew this was going to happen sooner or later so oh well. The problem is there's &gt;51% of people who don't mind the shitwater so your shitwater-hating minority is just going to have to suck it up and hold your nose when you take your showers.
Oh, and the ~~blessed few~~ captains of industry in the town have external shitwater deals where they trade out their shitwater for "Dirty Fiat" brand pure drinking water, so they really don't care because they can just move if the pond suddenly drains. And the sewage plant's primary source of shitwater is people from the houses themselves wandering over to eat Taco Bell and make use of their luxurious bathroom facilities. Satoshi Dice is a Bitcoin-only gambling service.

Society has already mostly decided that the best way to do it is a system for exchanging the promise of future value via tokens issued by a central governing authority at a slowly but steadily increasing rate. How about that. 
A deflationary currency isn't a new idea. It's been seen before and it's been done before, and it's been recognised as a terrible idea by anyone with more than two brain cells to rub together before. You think deflationary currency is a good idea because you're a total fucking idiot, as evidenced by you not even knowing why gold was deflationary.
