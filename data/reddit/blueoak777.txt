And he has lost face. He is disgraced for life. I know that doesn't replace the money but it's huge in itself.

Marketer here. If they moved the Bitcoin part much higher on the page, or added a "Pay With Bitcoin!" image maybe, or possibly add another pay button for BC users...or at least put some text right under the button it would be much more obvious to your average consumer. 
I too was curious why this was in Bitcoin at first. If they want to stress the Bitcoin option they need to make it more visible. 
Also, this entire post really reaks of spam, guys. It's ~1% related to Bitcoins in general, this should be in but it's like the knew it would never make it there so the threw it on us for the advertising.

You should set up an anon BC wallet if you intend to pay with BC.

It's $3 each time, plus the $10 fee the bank charges a month for the "privlege". Or maybe my bank just sucks big ass.

It will never, ever, ever happen. 
The government has their eyes and claws on Bitcoin now and they are attacking from all sides. Just because the dogs tail is wagging doesn't mean he won't bite. It's only a matter of time before the silk road is shut down now, so there goes a huge chunk of the value. Throw regulations on top of that and you're dead in the water. 
Consider how much actually hinges on the FED and the control they have over the money supply. Best case scenario? The government lets bitcoin do it's thing but charges a "tax" for using the service in a store. They will use attacks on the Silk Road to "regulate" the price. 
**If the government can drop the price of bitcoin below the cost to mine it's all over. They know that just as well as we do.**

How else are they going to get you to pay $75 a month for cell service?

So your advice is to boycot paper money and every store in the united states that accepts said paper money? I'm missing something here.
