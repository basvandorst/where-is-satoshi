You concerns are perfectly valid. Currently, no deposits are being lent out. Our trading platform, BTC.sx, operates with its own internal funds and the launch of Magnr does not change this. However, in the near future, a small proportion of client funds will be used for leveraged trades on our trading platform.
We have carefully modeled these risks and calculated a return that we can guarantee to our clients, ensuring a sustainable business model.
P.S. sorry for the delay in getting back to you (it was the weekend after-all!)

We hope to provide an account where users' coins are locked away for a set time period in return for a higher rate of interest. This is based on previous community feedback. Is there anything you would look for in an account?
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:26:52
We have noted this feature request and will be discussing this internally. I think it is possible that users will be able to have the option to own one key.
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:55:48
We guarantee that the interest rate stated in user accounts will be paid out is the biggest reason to use us. In terms of security, we operate with full reserves, full cold storage, and BitGo's Multi sig technology.

If you have had a good experience with BitVC, then by all means continue to save with them.
BTC.sx was founded in May 2013, by Joe Lee who has been active in the Bitcoin Talk community since 2011. If you want to learn more about us before trusting us with your bitcoin, then we can set up a call on josh.blatchford(at)magnr.com

We only support Bitfinex, itBit and Bitstamp - the most reputable exchanges in the industry.

We did say previously here, and on our FAQ page that: "The benefits we gain from Magnr are increased publicity and awareness"
We are a real company registered in the UK, our personal identities are clearly stated and our personal reputations are linked to the success of our company. We are incredibly incentivised to grow our company rather than make a quick buck through scamming people.
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:04:49
We earn money from our trading platform, [BTC.sx]( We can continue to survive, and thrive, while still paying out interest. Monetizing Magnr will simply be another revenue stream to compliment our existing cash flow.
@_date: 2015-06-17 22:01:23
Agreed. Free markets in action!
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:49:57
Sorry our last statement was not written as clearly as it could have been. All funds are stored offline, but all payments are processed online (you have to connect to the internet eventually!) through BitGo. 
This part of BitGo's API doc has more information:

Interest is paid out of trading revenues on BTC.sx. Anyone can withdraw their Bitcoin at any point so we really are not relying on more people investing after early adopters.
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:52:17
Unfortunately it is on our list of priorities but we haven't been able to have this ready in time for launch. We hope to have it ready as soon as a few other post-launch priorities have been deployed.

No. The interest is paid out of trading revenues on BTC.sx.

The funds are stored on the blockchain and our business model operates with full reserves. Therefore, in a worst-case scenario, deposits would be refunded if we went out of business.

Operator risk is the only risk. However, the funds are stored on the blockchain and our business model operates with full reserves. Therefore, in a worst-case scenario, deposits would be refunded if we went out of business.

But we proved that we protect client funds at all costs when we refunded all of our clients during the Mt Gox collapse. This was paid for out of our own pockets, despite having significant loses of our own.

It could be possible in the right conditions to earn more than 2.18%. From a client's perspective, we offer a more passive investment rather than swaps which require regular management and experience.

Most likely BitGo. We are working closely with BitGo to explore the option to allow clients to control a key for BTC.sx, as two of our exchange partners also use them.
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:23:48
We hope to offer users the option to control 1 private key in the near future. This would most likely be the backup key. However, the team have noted your preferences and we will discuss this internally. Thanks for your feedback

Currently no KYC/AML is required. But we are working to implement these policies. In the interest of client security and verification, we reserve the right to ask for personal details at any time.

Our revenue is in BTC. Therefore we do not have an exchange rate risk between BTC.sx and Magnr.
We receive BTC income and then pay out BTC interest.
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:01:00
Our trading platform has been operating since May 2013. When Mt Gox collapsed, we refunded all of our traders in full, despite having heavy losses ourselves. This meant that our traders did not lose a single satoshi. We have a proven track record of being able to issue refunds in times of crisis.

The interest rate comes from the fees generated by traders, which are then passed on to savers. This means that the variable interest rate depends on the amount of trading activity on the platform. Therefore, savers can expect higher interest rates when the price is volatile (trading activity goes up) and lower interest rates when the price is stable (trading activity goes down).

Even if the price of bitcoin falls, you are still in a better position than just keeping funds in a wallet. Although you would most likely lose money on exchange rates, by earning extra bitcoins as the price falls, you will have limited your loses. Regardless of the price, savers will always benefit - they make more money when the price rises and lose less money when the price falls.
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:25:59
Well it is certainly going to take several months to integrate KYC/AML. However, users should not be using this service to mix, clean or wash coins!
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:50:47
At the moment the money is just sitting in cold storage. Our business model ensures that for every one bitcoin deposited, at least one bitcoin can be withdrawn. This is because for one traders are auto-liquidated if their losses exceed their deposit. Secondly, the coins are not used to short bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:59:06
Our primary concern was making Magnr as user friendly as possible. Given customer feedback here, we will discuss the possibility to give users control over a private key. Thanks for your feedback.
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:08:44
No they are not used to short Bitcoin. Our trading platform has always allowed users to go long or short on the price of Bitcoin, without Magnr deposits anyway.
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:34:33
The benefits we gain from Magnr are increased publicity and awareness. We are currently considering various options to monetize Magnr in the future. Our business model ensures that for every one bitcoin deposited, at least one bitcoin can be withdrawn.
@_date: 2015-06-18 10:02:04
Traders must deposit a balance that acts as collateral. Then the leveraged part of the trade is made up of our own funds - not Magnr deposits. When a traders loss becomes so great that they risk going into a negative balance, they are margin called.
This prevents our funds being depleted.

We are currently working on integrating 2FA.

We cannot predict the future, but we hope both products will grow in tandem. As we become a larger provider of Bitcoin financial services, we expect users that sign up for one product will try out other products.

Great to see someone supporting the Bitcoin economy! Generally we find most people hoard a chunk of their Bitcoin, spend some and then  trade the rest.

Withdrawals are processed on a daily schedule from cold wallets - this is possible with BitGo's API. We also use their HD wallet tech, with multiple signers.

No problem. You are right about the leveraged trades, except it means people going long or short. However, we generally see traders go long more often than they go short.

Sure thing. Firstly, our platform is  (feel free to take a look for yourself).
We charge two fees:
1) 0.48% for opens and closes of positions
2) 0.30% daily interest on positions open for more than 1 day.
It is this second interest rate that will be primarily used to pay Magnr interest rates.

Thanks for your comment. We respect your opinion that some people will prefer to own their private keys over an interest rate.
