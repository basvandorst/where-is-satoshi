Its a pyriamid scheme. Everyone here will strongly encourage you to buy in which increases the price of Bitcoin and makes them money. If more people buy into it after you then the Bitcoin you bought will increase in value. But at some point people will realize that btc is not worth such a ludicrous amount and the value will tank and you will lose. 
I wouldnt be surprised if this kind of comment got me banned in this sub because the mods undoubtly have an interest in bitcoin.

They are never going to be a currency. They will always be an investment.

Your sister has no clue how much money you lost. You've already stated that you've misled her into believing you've made millions from bitcoin rising. She might have let you invest, but since you haven't communicated what is going on with the investments she isn't responsible for the fact you lost money and didn't tell her. She might want to cut your loses thousands of dollars ago. Instead you want to keep losing money cause your an idiot.

Yeah I hope Op realizes that if he doesn't give the rest of the money to his sister and loses it like he defiantly will. His sister will never communicate with him again.
So please Op you have a serious problem. Stop gambling. Get a therapist, give the money to your sister. Alot of people in this thread are telling you if you just held you would've made money..and I know that something in your head is going to click and you'll re-invest with the intent to hold. Only to lose more and more money. STOP now.
