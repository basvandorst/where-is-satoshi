You basically would have to have your own datacenter just to provide a service such as a blockchain explorer. Imagine having to download bsv from scratch after, idk, not even a year, half of a year, hell, 2, 3 months of 2gb blocks every ten minutes.
It would take a lifetime of syncing. Super discouraging for newcomers, huge point of friction, and possibly not just discouraging but maybe even impossible for many people.

Perhaps something similar could be done with an entire society. It is conceivable that a combination of empirical studies with increasingly sophisticated theory may eventually make possible fairly reliable short-term predictions of the way a society will react to any given change-just as fairly reliable short-term weather forecasting has become possible. Perhaps, then, a society might be successfully steered by means of frequent, intelli­ gent interventions in such a way that undesirable outcomes could usually be avoided and some desirable outcomes achieved. The steering process would not have to be infallible; errors could be corrected through further interventions. Just possibly, one might even hope to succeed in steering a society so that it would arrive in the long run at something approximating one's conception of a good society.
But this proposal too runs into difficulties of a fundamental kind. The first problem is: Who decides what outcomes are desirable or undesir­ able, or what kind of "good" society should be our long-term goal? There is never anything resembling general agreement on the answers to such questions. Friedrich Engels wrote in 1890:
History is made in such a way that the final result always arises from the conflicts among many individual wills, each of which is made into what it is by a multitude of special conditions of life; thus there are innumerable intersecting forces, an infinite collection of parallel­ ograms of forces, and from them emerges a resultant-the historical event-which from another point of view can be regarded as the product of one power that, as a whole, operates unconsciously and without volition. For what each individual wants runs up against the opposition of every other, and what comes out of it all is something that no one wanted.44
Norbert Elias, who was not a Marxist, made a very similar remark:
[ F ]rom the interweaving of countless individual interests and inten­ tions-whether tending in the same direction or in divergent and hostile directions-something comes into being that was planned and intended by none of these individuals, yet has emerged nevertheless from their intentions and actions.45
CHAPTER ONE: PART III 19
Even in those rare cases in which almost everyone agrees on a policy, effective implementation of the policy may be prevented by what is called the "problem of the commons." The problem of the commons consists in the fact that it may be to everyone's advantage that everyone should act in a certain way, yet it may be to the advantage of each individual to act in a contrary way.46 For example, in modern society it is to everyone's advantage that everyone should pay a portion of his income to support the functions of government. Yet it is to the advantage of each individual to keep all his income for himself, and that's why hardly anyone pays taxes voluntarily, or pays more than he has to.
The answer to the foregoing arguments will be that political institu­ tions exist precisely in order to resolve such problems: The concrete decisions made in the process of governing a society are not the resultant of conflicts among the innumerable individual wills of the population at large; instead, a small number of political leaders are formally empowered (through elec­ tions or otherwise) to make necessary decisions for everyone, and to enact laws that compensate for the problem of the commons by compelling indi­ viduals to do what is required for the common welfare (for example, laws that compel payment of taxes). Since the top political leaders are relatively few in number, it is not unreasonable to hope that they can resolve their differences well enough to steer the development of a society rationally.
Actually, experience shows that when the top political leaders number more than, say, half a dozen or so, it must seriously be doubted whether they can ever resolve their differences well enough to be able to govern in a consistently rational way. But even where no conflicts exist among the top leaders, the real power of such leaders is very much less than the power that is formally assigned to them. Consequently, their ability to steer the development of their society rationally is extremely limited at best.
When this writer was in the Sacramento County Main Jail in 1996-98, he had some interesting conversations with the jail adminis­ trator, Lieutenant Dan Lewis. In the course of one such conversation, on December 31, 1996, Lewis complained that it was not easy to get some ofhis officers to follow his orders, and he described the problems that a person in a position of formal power faces when he tries to exert that power to make his organization do what he wants it to do. If the leader takes measures that are resented by too many of the people under his command, he will meet with so much resistance that his organization will be paralyzed.47
20 ANTI-TECH REVOLUTION
It's not only jail administrators whose power is far more limited than it appears to an outsider.Julius Caesar reportedly said, "The higher our station, the less is our freedom of action."48 According to an English author of the 17th century: "Men in great place (saith one) are thrice ser­ vants; servants of the sovereign, or state; servants of fame; and servants of business. So as they have no freedom, neither in their persons, nor in their actions, nor in their times."49 U.S. President Abraham Lincoln wrote: "I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me."50
W hile F.W. de Klerk was President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela asked him why he did not prevent acts of violence that in some cases were being carried out with the collusion of the police. De Klerk replied, "Mr. Mandela, when you join me [as a member of the government] you will realise I do not have the power which you think I have."51 It's possible that de Klerk was pleading powerlessness as an excuse for tolerating violence that in reality he might have been able to prevent. Nevertheless, when Mandela himself became President, he "quickly realized, as de Klerk had warned him, that a President had less power than he appeared to. He could rule effectively only through his colleagues and civil servants, who had to be patiently persuaded... ."52
In line with this, a thorough student of the American presidency, Clinton Rossiter, has explained how severely the power of the President of the United States is limited, not only by public opinion and by the power ofCongress, but also by conflicts with members of his own administration who, in theory, are totally under his command.53 Rossiter refers to "the trials undergone by [Presidents] Truman and Eisenhower in persuading certain chiefs of staff, whose official lives depend entirely on the President's plea­ sure, to shape their acts and speeches to the policies of the administration."54 One of our most powerful presidents, Franklin D. Roosevelt, complained:
The Treasury is so large and far-flung and ingrained in its practices that I find it is almost impossible to get the actions and results I want... . But the Treasury is not to be compared with the State Department. You should go through the experience of trying to get any changes in the thinking, policy and action of the career diplomats and then you' d know what a real problem was. But the Treasury and the State Department put together are nothing compared with the Na-a-vy. The admirals are really something to cope with-and I

I found Ted Kaczynski’s (The Unabomber) breakdown of it to be the most insightful. He covers it in his recent book (2016) titled Anti-Tech Revolution: Why and How. Full pdf [here]( The related part is on page 19 of the book, but I suggest checking out the entire book, it’s an incredible read. Or at least the parts around page 19, to see if you’d find it interesting. It is packed with historical examples and is overall a very clear and well-articulated analysis of the modern technological industrial system.

Thanks for sharing. Hope this isn’t spammy, scammy stuff, like what you would typically find with online drug-related shopping websites.
I’m guessing when seeds go through the mail they are not really scrutinized because it’s a bit hard to determine what the seed is going to end up turning into... I am imagining that websites would be shut down every now and then, though. Because that U.S. website doesn’t try to hide whatsoever what they are selling.
I have had some seeds of my own laying around that I only recently tried to get to grow, and one of the five seeds started sprouting. They are still in the moist paper towel stage, it’s been like three days, but I’m excited about the growth of the one and think the others may follow.
I am not trying to start a professional operation over here, haha, and am just exercising my green thumb, and haven’t even bothered to check out the whole male/female seeds thing. I have a hunch that the seeds you’d find in bud don’t end up producing flowers.
That U.S. site you’ve linked, is there any way I can really trust these people with my btc? That url looks random af. I figure if I throw it into a who is that it will have a relatively recent creation date...

There’s a character limit so I could not fit the rest of the related bit in that post. He goes into some lesser-known historical examples of rulers who had theoretical absolute power.
In the beginning of the book he states that what follows is the result of a lifetime of research and intensive thought. He points out that the social sciences are not like the other sciences, where if the same rules are followed mechanically, the result is the same every time.
It’s a great read overall. The guy is a genius.
