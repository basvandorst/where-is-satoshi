Not sure what one has to do with the other \- there's a reason that christmas lightning was in the news as well as having a ridiculously high energy consumption. Also I believe you're confused about the units, as bitcoin's energy consumption is still 10 times as much \(67 TWh\) as the annual christmas energy consumption.

From the article I posted:
His website, which is updated daily, now shows the network consuming 67TWh annually, just under that upper bound of 7.7GW shown in his new study.
The units may be a bit confusing \- a network consuming 1 GW for one year corresponds to a total energy consumption of 1 GW \* 365\*24 hours = 8760 GWh = 8.76TWh

Sheldon is Satoshi would be a bit more original and may have some potential..

I used a high price for electricity, so it should even out. Still, even if only half their cost are power, it does not change the conclusion: bitcoin mining is terrible for the environment, and it will only become worse as time passes

Allright, an alternative and conservate approach to calculate the power usage:
Current hash rate is 10,000,000 TH/s. An antminer s9, the most efficient miner currently on the market, uses 0.1 j/GH. 
Assuming all bitcoin mining is done with antminer s9 (not very likely),total power consumption is 8TWh per year, still a crazy figure. The real value will likely be somewhere between the above two estimates, but it doesn't change the fact that a crazy amount of power is going towards bitcoin..

The point is not economic sustainability, but environmental. The power companies will likely burn extra fossil fuels to meet the demand, leading to faster global warming

Forget about the article - did you even read the headline?
Dump 100k on the market - by the headline, that means that the market cap of bitcoin increases by 5 million. That means that the price per bitcoin increases by about 30 cents (as there are 16 million bitcoins out there). Your statement is completely consistent with the headline.

It was not that easy, the tools to mine bitcoins were not user friendly at all.

I remember when google came out. People were not sure Google was worth its valuation back then. Remember, it was a search engine only, and advertising companies weren't keen on buying online ads over physical ads. Ad blockers were starting to come out, threatening their entire business model. It was easy to imagine a future where ad blockers were installed by default on browsers, and Google could not make any profit. No one predicted that google would expand to video and e-mail. It was a very risky investment back then.

Why would the FED print more money is roughly the same question. It is not inconceivable that people would decide to mine more money, especially when the mining is insignificant compared to the bitcoin economy.
