I feel like the "announcement" is worse than no announcement at all.  It doesn't say anything of relevance.

How do you know other members of the foundation aren't in cahoots with Mark?  He could be letting them buy bitcoins off his exchange and allow them to move them outside of MtGox.   
@_date: 2013-10-01 18:03:46
I know what he is talking about.  They used to have an option to buy bitcoins using different services.  One had your dial a long distance number and enter a code a think.  They had differet options for different countries.  It was back when they still let you sell bitcoins to the moneypak guy through their site.
@_date: 2013-06-28 21:12:50
Haha, yeah, last time funds weren't showing up I received an email back about 30 minutes after submitting a ticket.  It too asked for more details.  I didn't hear back until after my coins arrived four days later.

Happy day of cake.  Bitcoins are great and I'm happy you're happy.

Sweet suggestion.  I'm going to try that bitinstant.com /moneygram thing right now.
....oh wait, it isn't available on their webpage now.
@_date: 2013-06-20 11:54:48
Did you see how much personal information was avaible for the guy just by searching?  His name and address were in the paper talking about how he bought a Porsche with Bitcoins.  It didn't seem difficult to gather the info.
@_date: 2013-06-29 00:31:32
I wasn't sure if it was just me not seeing it.  Guess it wasn't.

So OP, have you received your BTC in your account yet?   It's going on 17 hours since a made a cash deposit and it still hasn't show up at my bitcoin address.   My brother is going on 18 hours with no BTC in his account yet.   I deposited $170, he did $200.   No word from bitinstant support since the initial reply to the ticket asking if we sued the new site or the old site.   That's it.  Now we are just trying to be patient but not hearing anything from support makes us worry a bit.

Some of us have to be towards the front of the "queue".   If we completed our orders yesterday at 1pm (over 24 hours ago) how deep in the queue should have have to get to resolve our issues?
@_date: 2013-06-11 23:06:39
I don't understand why it takes so long to get funds when you are having trouble.  You have a copy of the zip zap email, the amount paid in cash and the zip zap account number.  It seems you could just send the funds over from whatever wallet it should have come from and be done with it.  Now we are going on six hours since money was sent and I received the email from zipzap.  Support replied within minutes asking for the zip zap account number (which was included in the attachment already from the initial support ticket) and then nothing.    Even though you have issues that aren't resolved you still keep the same service open that was broken for me like there isn't an issue.  
@_date: 2013-06-11 19:17:25
Yeah, no it isn't working.   So far I have two cash payments to a bitcoin address that aren't showing up at all.  One is from over an hour ago.   I hope you don't fuck us over like last time this happened.  I remember getting about .4BTC less than I should have received at the time I made the transaction and your support just told me tough shit.   
Also, how do we log an issue with support if we don't have any email from bitinstant on our cash deposit?  I have the successful payment email from zipzap  (for both transactions) but nothing from bitinstant.
@_date: 2013-07-01 04:45:50
Speaking of, I want an easy way to get the number the red phone dials.  I want to call it before I get to the store and enter the kiosk number so all I have to do is go to the counter and pay.  I don't like using that phone but it is faster than walking through walmart.  
Someone record the tones going out when you pick up the red phone so we can figure out which number it calls.
@_date: 2013-06-09 15:19:05
I swear it isn't so unrelated to bitinstant.com not allowing cash deposits at the moment.  Freaking sucks.   Can't even get money in fast enough to take advantage of dropping prices.  
@_date: 2013-06-22 12:56:54
Yeah, your story is full of so much bullshit. Have your friend login to his dwolla account and screen capture the transaction history on this deposit to mtgox.  It'll be there.  At least act like your the guy with the issue if are going to waste time with posting this crap.
@_date: 2013-10-01 18:40:53
I don't know if this would be causing issues or not.  I'm on a slow network and didn't check that many of the results but I found some with spins  so I know they have at least been used.

I can second issues with Bit777.   I was playing deuces wild and it wasn't counting my coins correctly.  $10 should have lasted at least 40 plays but it was gone in 4-8 maybe.
Also their withdraw system is jacked up.  I tried to withdraw $19 and it went to pending status but kept the funds available in my account   Also, any place that requires up to 24 hours for a withdraw using bitcoins is not to be trusted.   The advantage should be instant withdraws.  None of this waiting shit.
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:09:01
Neither does OP.

Has anyone had to wait for a seller to get back to you after sending payment?  I've only had five transactions and four of those were complete in less than 10 minutes (the 5th took about 20 minutes).   On the transaction I've got going today I paid six hours ago and haven't heard a single thing from the seller.   I may be impatient but it is really throwing me for a loop now that it is taking so long.  It really jacked up the plans I had for those coins too.

See the sidebar to the right?  It says, "No compilations of free Bitcoin sites."  I think they have that rule because the bitcoin subreddit would be full of people setting up their own compilation with referral links and trying to make some extra BTC with it.
@_date: 2013-05-30 17:14:18
I find it funny that they want to work with "legit" businesses but my transaction from over a month ago using their partner technocashier has been charged on my card but never sent into my OKPay account.   
OKPay said tough luck you need to contact technocashier.  I did that the very first night by opening a ticket with them.  They haven't responded one time to any email or trouble ticket I have opened.   I just lost my money that time using someone that OKPay recommended.
@_date: 2013-06-29 17:49:59
They want to pretend they are professional but they remove and add stuff all the time and never update customers.  They have Facebook, twitter, blog and support accounts on multiple sites like Reddit and Bitcointalk but they just keep quiet about things and consider that the right way to do it I guess.
@_date: 2013-06-22 17:33:34
I was having trouble using them from both IE and Firefox.   I was finally able to figure out what was causing the issue on Firefox (it was the saved user/pass information somehow making buttons unclickable if you can believe that).  I removed the saved account info from Firefox and was able to place an order fine after that (but not using the guest option)
In IE it doesn't show half the txt or populate fields when it is "retrieving details"  bitinstant.com was really just worthless in IE.   
I know it isn't much but that's all I've got.  Yes, the new site eats penis.

No money for myself or my brother yet.   Both of us did cash transfer to BTC address.  He did his at Wal-Mart, me at CVS.   It's been 21 hours for him and no coins at the address even though Zip Zap confirmed his payment of $200.   I've seen no coins yet even though Zip Zap confirmed my payment as soon as I paid almost 19 hours ago ($170).

I've paid well above market price for Bitcoins on localbitcoins when I wanted to do something late at night and had no BTC at the moment.   
The nice thing is you can list coins for sale at any price and either someone will buy or they won't.   It doesn't hurt to ask $50 above market price if you offer a low minimum purchase amount (say...$20 or less) and a method of payment that can be used in the middle of the night (moneypak or vanilla reload purchased from wal-mart, etc).  
@_date: 2013-06-28 21:18:50
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-06-12 14:05:44
Now the price is going up above what we paid at the time of cash transfer.  It'll be interesting to see if they give us BTC = to the price when we made the cash deposit or the BTC = to the current price when they finally send it out.    
Last time they used the price when they had time to send it and it cost many people money.
@_date: 2013-06-28 05:52:52
Same thing happened to me.  It wasn't big bucks but I still have the messages saved from when I talked to them:
I sent $43.20 at 17:37 (12:37pm central time)
BTC closed at $80 at 1:00pm
I was expecting .54
I was sent .33578889 after you checked my order for me on the forums.
That is more like buying when BTC is at $129 (the close around the time I received coins was $121-$119 I think)
Their last reply was : Gox had halted trading at the time of your order so we were only able to execute your order when they re-opened.  Have you also considered the fees we charge?  You can see more info regarding fees at bitinstant.com
Gox was trading when I placed my order and when I paid my order.  They never did anything about it.  Just ignored the ticket from then on.

Damn it.  They had it set to 1 forever didn't they?  Weak.  
@_date: 2013-06-12 21:15:38
So those of us that received confirmation from Zip Zap after our cash deposits yesterday but still aren't seeing results or deposits today...when will we see our order manually pushed through?  Both my brother and myself placed orders that were successful according to Zip Zap but neither order has shown up on the bitcoin address they were sent to.  Ours weren't going to an exchange, just to a bitcoin address.

You can even find ZipZp Inc on the moneygram.com webpage.  Receive code is, of course, 9611.  I have that memorized.

Do you have a tendancy to store your passwords in a file somewhere else on your computer?  Were you mining at the time or were the coins that you received sent from an address that you control (like an online wallet, mining pool, etc)  Maybe you made the password similar to that one.  
These two addresses are the ones I'm talking about:

Look at places like bitinstant and what they will transfer to and from.  You can send a BTC-E code out easy enough but you can't send anything to BTC-E.  When the crash happened weeks ago they wouldn't take any payments in to anything other than mtgox (which wasn't working) so it was preventing people from profiting.  I think there is so much more collusion between different companies dealing with BTC.
