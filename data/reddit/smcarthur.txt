They are unsafe? I am completely unaware. I've always thought they were very safe. Change my view?

I have a good family and good friends. I don't think anything would change if everyone knew I won the lottery. I must be really lucky since people keep talking about drug addict family and friends taking advantage of them and shit. Is it really that uncommon to only be surrounded by grounded people?

If you don't think the IRS won't be investigating heavily into bitcoin transactions after all of this media attention, you're a naive kid. 
And they don't monitor all transactions, *unless* you get audited. Then they absolutely will investigate every last transaction. And when they notice the bank has you depositing more money than you make in a year? Yeah, you're getting audited.

There are an incredible number of morons here.

Honestly, the "buy low, sell high" maxim is nonsense in every investment field. No one knows when you're in a peak or a valley for pretty much anything. You only know in hindsight. Will the stock market crash tomorrow and this is as high as it will go for another 10 years? Who knows. I thought it hit a high like 2 years ago, and it turns out it was apparently a low since it's just kept skyrocketing.

Because there are tens of millions of Redditors from all walks of life. Some are rich. Some are poor. Why is this surprising?

So you think tax law looks at the price of the crypto at the stroke of midnight on New Years and taxes you accordingly? How about you put 30 seconds of research into a theory before littering and spreading the nonsense online?

$13 billion.
Seriously, though, losing billions of dollars on bad investments is not a crime. You have to prove the individual intentionally lied to his investors. That is incredibly difficult to prove, especially when they have the best legal team money can buy.

It's not even  in searches regarding news. It's  **trending**, which is very different from total search number.

No one. LinkedIn is, by definition, related to your work and not personal. It is just a bitchy, dismissive response. "Personal LinkedIn page" is called facebook.com.

No, using a high-interest credit card to "invest" money you don't have is stupid as fuck, I don't care if you get 12 months no interest. No investment is surefire.

How is Mutual Fund not an option? Pretty sure that is the only option that might rival Bitcoin, so quite convenient that it was left out =/

Yup. I know =/

I have business banking/private client with Chase and I get lots of free wires per month, no matter the size or international. Granted, you have to have several hundred thousand just sitting in the bank to get these privileges, but they are there.
