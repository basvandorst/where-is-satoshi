Beating shitcoins in dominance is not something to brag about. 
However, it is a step in the right direction when a sound, revolutionary project of historic proportions increases its dominance over a fuckin' coin for dentists.

As F. Ulrich eloquently put it:
Bitcoin is the most underrated yet most powerful socioeconomic experiment in this century. In one sweep,its mere existence is debunking decades of propaganda about monetary theory,while proving that anarchy (absence of authority)does in fact work. No wonder no one understands it.

It took FED couple of centuries to build their financial system. 
After just five years, the Crypto Financial System offers fundraising, trading, lending, derivatives, payments, contracts &amp; insurance. Its solutions are trustless, global, extensible, and 24/7.
This is the power of being able to program money without permission.
