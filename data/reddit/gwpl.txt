TL;DR- Turned out that forwarding emails from my servers to  was leading to gmail.com allowing all emails from Kraken except those with activaiton links. I resolved problem by redirecting email traffic to my email server. The considered, but not tested alternative was to try PGP email encryption option offered by Kraken.
Here is log with timing to provide valuable record that Kraken was reachable and helpful in resolving situation and not scam :). However some people suspected Kraken to prioritise users according to amound of assets they keep. Therefore, it may be important datapoint for you that I was keeping there quite a bit of assets... however those are unconfirmed hypothesis I came across on other forums. For me  - person keeping a bit of assets - Kraken turned out reponsive and fault not on their, but  side.
* I want to add Withdrawal Address 
* However I do not receive required emails with activation link
* (Email address works perfectly for everyone else)
* (Update) I receive other emails from Kraken: I just received automatic email from Kraken with confirmation for creating support ticket! Therefore, **only emails allowing me to add withdrawal accounts are not arriving**...
Before I create support ticket, could you - other users confirm - if maybe there is no sense because Kraken is known from temporary problems with sending emails , is it?
I am not getting any emails to confirm my BTC, LTC, ETH accounts : "The withdrawal address needs to be confirmed. An email with approval instructions has been sent to you. The link in the email expires in one hour."
When I try to Bitcoin or Ether Withdrawal , the only I get is "The withdrawal address needs to be confirmed. An email with approval instructions has been sent to you but may have expired.".
(Yes, email works, it receives emails from other exchanges and email providers...).
Could you please confirm if issue is temporary to other users and it's question of trying again, and again?
**Updates (tracking of resolution of issue)**: 
* 2017-10-18 : This day issue lasts for ~5h , then I go sleep and next day continues. I wrote new ticket using:      following advice in : 
* 2017-10-19 ~9:15 UTC | Another day it's not working =&gt; I opened support ticket: **Request  following instructions on :  and later submitting request 
* 2017-10-19 | Only emails with confirmation links does not arrive! Others, even for Kraken arrive: I just received automatic email from Kraken with confirmation for creating support ticket!
* 2017-10-19 16:13 UTC | received answer to support ticket and email from Kraken informing me about it (therefore I receive emails from Kraken, therefore email works as a service).
* 2017-10-19 16:50 UTC | tried again to add LTC account and checking email and spam folders as requested by Kraken Support. I give systems some time, before giving up.
* 2017-10-19 19:04 UTC | still no email with activation link , not in inbox, not in spam.
* 2017-10-19 19:12 UTC | Send response to Kraken Support ticket with update, confirming again that: things still does not work and I check regularly spam folder, and I receive other emails from Kraken but not those with activation link for adding Withdrawal accounts. (For readers: I am effectively blocked from taking away my digital assets (crypto-currencies) I keep there).
* 2017-10-19 19:18 UTC | I got response from Kraken support, stating that they forward issue to specialist and will "be in touch with an update as soon as possible".
* 2017-10-20 8:46 UTC (10:46 CET) | "Email delivery works fine from our side and we receive successful confirmation from your email server. Please address the issue to your email provider and check your SPAM folder." -&gt; first of all... I wrote them that emails arrive. Only those with activation links does not. Anyhow, I decided to try if it work Today again, result:
* 2017-10-20 15:01 UTC | Today, Kraken Withdrawal tab malfunctions. Sometimes displaying "Function disabled" [screenshot]( sometimes "Claudflare error" [screenshot]( sometimes "This data is not currently available" [screenshot]( Therefore I was unable to even try again.
* 2017-10-20 16:04 UTC | Send response to Kraken support ticket with:
  * 1. question if they checked delivery of emails **specifically** with activation links. As I repeat all over again that other Kraken emails arrive and I check spam folder.
  * 2. screenshots and note from previous point that I observe Today Kraken having general difficulties with it's Withdrawal Tab.
* 2017-10-20 16:12 UTC | Seems that after hour (look at 15:01 UTC bullet), there is a change that this Withdrawal tab works. As of course it does not deliver email and support was insisting that emails are delivered properly, I am changing my account email to  one to see if there is still an issue.
* 2017-10-20 16:40 UTC | Got in touch with my email provider. They started investigating servers configurations.
* 2017-10-22 23 UTC | Tried multiple times to test troubleshooting hypothesis , but unfortunately I get constantly Claudflare and other strange errors on Kraken site. I will try tomorrow.
* 2017-10-23 19:12 UTC | Managed to make **successful withdraw of crypto** ! Troubleshooting and resolution went as follows: emails with activation link were disappearing without sign in logs when being forwarded from my server to  Once I reconfigured to deliver messages to my email server, I started receiving activation links! (Considered but not tested yet workaround: you can also try using PGP encryption available with Kraken, so hopefully encrypted messages will not be filtered out by gmail). And to be clear: those messages were not going to gmail spam folder, they were dropped earlier by spam protection silently.
