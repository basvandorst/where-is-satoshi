Not possible. The SHA256 algorithm is not being changed in the difficulty adjustment so it can always be solved. What is changing is "target" number that SHA256 hashes of the header must be below to be valid. If difficulty ever overshoots and not enough blocks are being found the next adjustment will lower it.

On energy, it is possible but unlikely in my opinion that energy costs could rise enough to make hashing unviable. ASICs are getting more energy efficient and renewable energy sources would become more prevalent if energy costs in the larger economy are getting too expensive. Basically the economy would direct energy resources to be more efficient. You already see some of this in mining farms being set up in places like [Iceland]( where energy is cheap.

Good point. Could just send to a new address though.

It's almost as if anyone can start an organization and give it some stand out name like idk " the bitcoin foundation " and have a platform for the community to follow. How pretentious!

Seriously no one cares how you feel about your experience playing the bitcoin industry's Upton Sinclair for nearly half a week.
Give people some solid information on wtf happened and they will appreciate it. Thanks.

How is not touching them harder than exchanging?

"I mine crypto for a living" &lt;- how people should know not to listen to you about the value of altcoins.

Buy off Amazon. Use the savings to buy more bitcoin.

Stop trying to make 'Ƀ' happen. It's not going to happen.

The political aspect is hard coded. This isn't a "direction", it is the programmed trajectory of bitcoin.

wow a whole cent!

Don't count on this... If you are audited, you better have proof of exactly when and what price you paid for them.

1 BTC per block will be PLENTY of incentive in 100 years when the reward is gone.

You are making as many (or more) assumptions as he is...
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:30:27
From what I've seen there is enough for personal use, would probably be difficult to efficiently hedge large positions.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:07:27
Yes. Why would you pay $10-$20 more for the same bitcoin?
Edit: assuming there is enough liquidity elsewhere to fill your order.
@_date: 2013-10-03 18:01:36
Which is perfectly fine if you want the currency to succeed.
