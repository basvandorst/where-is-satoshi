Of course, you're not one of those people. No one that makes this argument ever is.

She was attending a speech, how is that baiting the crowd?

It's definitely either a good time or a bad time to buy.

I have a feeling that OP is a faggot.  
I saw an article on the guardian holding reddit partly responsible for the bitcoin bubble and subsequent burst. 
OP sees the article and realises that reddit is an influence on the value of bitcoin.  He either owns some bitcoins, already and wants more, or wants to get into the market.    
OP posts a wah-wah post about how he invested a ton of money and lost, and hopes that new investors stay away while he buys it up at a low point.  
Fuck you OP.    I don't believe this bullshit about you going 'all-in' for one second.    You are trying to push down the price so you can get more bitcoins.
It's just that simple, folks.

In a week your bitcoins might be worth 500 dollars, or 50 cents.  Bitcoin is volatile as fuck.   You have no one to blame but yourself.
Currency trading is gambling.  Bitcoin is about as risky as it gets.   If those $10,000 were important to you, then you're a fucking idiot.  
I would have invested in bitcoin if I had the money shortly after the Cyprus crisis.  It was 66 dollars then.   But you bought in way too fucking late, and you have no one to blame but yourself. 
You're an idiot.
