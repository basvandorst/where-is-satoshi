Wow that's amazing. I wish I was in your family... :(

Seems like you should only use exchanges for small amounts of money and keep the rest in your own private accounts that you control the private key for.
Exchanges won't bother freezing small sums and even if they did what does it matter?

What is this referring to?

Also thanks so much for the quick reply!

That's good because I'm not rocket scientist.
Based on your expertise do you think the panic about removing BTC from Coinbase is unfounded?

Why isn't the community even MORE hostile to these forks? It seems like every fork that reduces the size of the community kinda by definition devalues the currency everyone is already holding.
Surely the only 'fork' the community should be supporting would be one that has convinced more than 51% of nodes/miners to adopt it?

Thank you for the detailed reply.
So the 'nonce' is basically a scratch pad where we can write "nonsense" to alter the output of the hash in an attempt to randomly stumble across a combination that when stacked like soo...
PREVIOUS BLOCK HASH
TRANSACTION LIST
PROOF OF WORK (Nonce?)
Run that all through our SHAH 256 encryption algorithm and BOOM, if we have enough leading 0's we have stumbled upon the correct answer and we "win the block." Do I have it right now? so we keep changing that Nonce value and running it through SHAH-256 until we find a winning combination?
Now, the last thing I have a question about; what is the bitcoin community's response to the idea that the 2400 transaction per 10 minutes limit is far too low? Is there a solution to that besides the dreaded Segwit "upgrade" ?

Can you explain why dropping coinbase bitcoins is the right decision right now? What is all this hullabaloo about?
Also, what about Kraken or similar platforms?

You have 450 BTC and feel like you missed out? That's almost 2 million dollars worth of bitcoins...
You are probably in the top .5% of owners. I would kill to have a fraction of your BTC.
Crazy man.
