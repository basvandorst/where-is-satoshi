What can I buy with Bitcoin?
I'm a mid 20s professional living in Canada working in the tech sector. I own my own home with a small mortgage, a car, and everything that entails living indepdently and comfortably in the west coast. Realistically, what value does Bitcoin have for me other than to be traded on speculation? You can throw around words like "decentralized" and "permissionless" all you want, but it boils down an ultimately contextless, meritless claim for someone in my position.
I make a pretty good living working regularly. And as far as I can tell, people get into crypto for two reasons: interest in blockchains and speculative trading. The former would not bother promoting it because it serves them no purpose, and the latter are just vultures looking to get rich by watching youtube videos or capturing trends where there are none. I know this because one of the only posts made by a "quant" after the crash in prices was met with head nodding and a couple of "good write-up, really informative" type posts. Go figure.

I do believe traditional transactions are going out the window. But to think that a system of exchange where tokens were eaten up by speculative investments early release would somehow be standardized among the commodities market (for example) is absurd. And if your goal is to popularize blockchain, you wouldn't treat the coin solely as a source of arbitrage like the majority of crypto holders. You'd use it where you can to buy goods and services. 
As far as merchant adoption, I'd say major tech companies refusing crypto payment is the opposite of that. You be the judge.
