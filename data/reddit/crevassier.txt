Until these localbitcoin sellers you enjoy sell at closer to market rates around me, Coinbase is a necessary evil.

Too bad it's blocked at the moment. Just watched it jump $2k from 11-13.

I am going to give this a try after my $5 paperwallet stocking stuffer idea got gang banged by a $27 fee last night.

Tells you in BTC, which fucking sucks ass. Had that happen to me 2 days ago, learned the GDAX method. Wonder how long before that goes away though?

I was going to do $5 paperwallets of BTC as a stocking stuffer to a bunch of family. 
Did my first one yesterday... $27 in fees for $5, AND it took a few hours to hit.
Yep, not going to use BTC no matter how high profile it is, for that again.

If you have that amount of cash to toss around in the market I hope you have enough sense to talk to a tax attorney.

And here I was ready to buy buy buy on Monday afterwards, until I read most of the comments on here.

Been looking for something to replace the void that Circle left me. I'm in!

You don't need to use bitcoin... just pay via debit or credit card.

Coolest integration so far AND it's getting a ton of front page time on the App store. The face you can switch between BTC and $ is nice as well for the neophytes.

I decided to migrate and started my request this week, was verified and ready to go by end of business that day.
I did link a bank vs opening one to just transfer stuff into.

I think my Kraken tier 3 is in hell though. That’s pushing months :/
