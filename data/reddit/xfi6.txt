Good to see you're not getting downvoted to oblivion like I was [2 months ago]( before the price tanked. In particular, my comment:

I take it that is maturing.

If the price rises to $700, then that would be enough evidence for him to think that the price will continue rising in the future.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, not a person. There is no "good news for Bitcoin". I think you mean "good news for people who are considering purchasing bitcoins", but then why should you care about those people? Don't you already own bitcoins of your own?

Another major issue discussed in [another thread]( is that Bitcoin reached $15, which is half of what it was just before the first bubble popped at $30—and it's been noted that bubbles often stabilize at half of the first bubble.

And some people here and there will start selling everything RIGHT before it hits $100, since it's a nice even number and "hey, since it reached this nice even number, and I'm happy with all this money I got, I'll be happy if I sell".

Is there a web service dedicated for that? Obviously writing down a private key on paper (especially if the pen they give you is low on ink) will be incredibly tedious and error-prone, or it will give the wrong idea that Bitcoin is complicated to use. And using an ordinary pastebin website to reduce the number of characters you have to write down may not be very secure as more people try this in the long-run.
If there's a single pastebin type of website that, if not more secure, makes the process of leaving a bitcoin tip easier (e.g. you write down on the receipt "receive 0.1 btc from bittip.me/mountfujilowtides" and the page offers instructions on setting up a bitcoin wallet and converting to USD), maybe that could make it (slightly) more practical.
Even if our phones could somehow print out a QR code with the link (such that the URL does not have to be human friendly) or wallet's private key, there's no guarantee the waiter/waitress even has a smartphone, no less with a barcode app installed.

This sound like a good idea. You know the colored bars printed on the flaps of an opened box of crackers? The hot glue is guaranteed to rip about half of it off when you open the box.
It think if somebody wants to get in the business of selling these, it would be trivial to slap a cheap-ass "warranty void if removed" type of sticker as the seal.
Edit: Looks like the holographic sticker does more than just provide confidence that the seal hasn't been broken.

The article says: "In July 2010, a bug was discovered that allowed anyone to spend anyone else’s Bitcoins." It points to [ CVE-2010-5141]( This is false; this vulnerability involved a double-spend attack, not wallet theft.

I've tried on three separate occasions, when butterflylabs.com was up, to visit the HTTPS version of their site. Each time, after getting a cert error, immediately afterwards I closed Firefox, re-opened it, and tried visiting the regular HTTP version—and retried on my Android phone—and found that it was, all of a sudden, down, only to come back 5 or 10 minutes later.
Yes, I could be wrong, and it could just be that they're doing maintenance, but I thought it's interesting that this has worked so reliably for me.

1. Create two bitcoin addresses
2. Mine your own coins
3. Once you have 20BTC or so, start transferring money back and forth between the two addresses. If each trade is a number between 1 and 1e9 satoshis, then each trade can represent 29 raw bits, or log2(1000000000) = 29.897 fractional bits if you use range coding in base 10.
You will eventually lose all of it in transaction fees, but if you are trying to distribute a political message or something valuable to your community members, the couple grand it sets you back is worth it.

Some other mistakes:


* The " - " should be replaced with an em dash ("—", Unicode: U+2014, HTML: &amp;amp;mdash;) without spaces in between.
* Should be "seamless".


* Should be "readily".
* Should be "Now that BitcoinRunner is here".


* According to Wikipedia's Manual of Style, the dash should not be a hyphen but rather an en dash ("–", Unicode: U+2013, HTML: &amp;amp;ndash;) with a space in between, but maybe I'm being a little too pedantic.
Also, your "bitcoinrunner.com -&gt;  redirection is broken.

I wanted to discount the danger of holding your savings in an exchange account, but then I remembered bitfloor. So you're right. Print out the private key to your wallet after encrypting it (through AES-256) with a password sentence you will never forget ([and DO NOT do this with an HP printer]( and keep it in a safety deposit box in each home you own or frequently visit.

Not quite. You're buying the equivalent computing power ownership proportion of the network. For example, if it took you 1% ownership of the network to be able to mine a single 25BTC block every (.01 * 6*X = 1.0; X=) 17 hours for a whole month, all the bitcoins you made then are a token of proof that you were able to sustain 1% ownership of the network for that long. Nobody else can take your spot.
