Is there software that keeps track of this for you?  I sell on localbitcoins and thus have hundreds of transactions.  I have kept track of my money gained (both in BTC and $ profit) as well as the prices sold and purchased, but it would be insanely difficult for me to sort through this stuff manually.

Will this ever be available for iOS?

I'm a BTC supporter but I agree. I pay a small fee every time I buy from coinbase.  So why would I buy BTC for $51 to spend on a $50 item when I can just spend $50.  It's not a lot, but it does add up with larger amounts.  What would be the way around this aside from offering some sort of discount when paying with BTC?

To put it into perspective, I sell on localbitcoins.com and consistently use a mark-up price of 8% and my BTC get sold incredibly quickly whenever I fund my wallet.  The convenience is important to people because obtaining BTC is still difficult to those who are less tech savvy (aka lazy).  It's also important to consider that darknetmarkets still exist and these methods are probably the primary source of people buying BTC anonymously, although as far as I understand some ATMs do require an ID.  The rates will probably come down as the ATM companies break even and start turning a profit as well.

I've never received a tip before..

Thanks for the post.  I'm a low volume seller on localbitcoins.com, but I still have technically sold thousands of dollars worth of BTC.  However, at the time of selling, I re-buy an amount of BTC slightly higher than what I sold, as well as turn some profit into fiat.  So, let's say I've sold thousands of dollars in BTC, but I have actually only gained a small amount of profit in BTC and fiat.  I've actually kept track of all of my transactions and profits, but as I interpret your layout, the actual selling of BTC is what matters.  Therefore, even though I have a relatively low amount of sells, the actual reporting would get extremely messy.  Thoughts?

I agree that something like 8% is really high, but you can't deny the fact that people are willing to buy at that price.  Because there is no competition, there is no reason to lower the fees if they are meeting their expected purchases/income, whatever that may be.  I don't think the people are using the ATM because they see a "BTC accepted here" sign and an ATM nearby and say, "oh I better pay +8% markup so I can go use BTC at x store."   Rather, I think the purchasers are probably people in passing who have perhaps heard of bitcoin and never bought before.  They aren't checking the price everyday and but they probably know the price was once above $1000 and perhaps they had a friend try to encourage them to buy but have never acted on it yet.  These are what you would call "crappy" speculators and I do believe they exist.  Also, like I mentioned I don't think you can underestimate the use of BTC in the world of dark net markets.  I do agree that there is no way 8% fees will last in the future, but why stop if it works now?

It was just a question..not sure why the downvotes

I'm a low volume seller although I do have over 200+ trade.  I've done several LBC trades online today with no problems.  I am going to remove my coins to an offline wallet for the time being though

This is what I do.  I like to think of it as putting my money where my mouth is.  Last 5 online purchases have been in bitcoin

I really liked the video explanation.  Perfect for the average user to understand and doesn't complicate things.

Another question pertaining to the block chain.  I sent a small amount of BTC from my multi bit wallet to another wallet over a week ago and it is still unconfirmed/seen by 1 peer.  The balance has been deducted from my wallet but still hasn't appeared in my receiving wallet.  The wallet address is 100% correct.  When I look up the transaction details on the block chain or block explorer it just says no transaction found.  What can I do about this??
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:25:54
As in just re-send the same amount to the same address?

I put Multibit onto an encrypted USB.  When I unlock my USB, I have an encrypted wallet built into Multibit.  I send my coins from coin base to this wallet.  Can someone with experience tell me if this is a safe and logical method?  Is this how Multibit is supposed to be used?  I just set this up the other day.  Thanks
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:51:06
Could you explain further what you mean by multiple copies?  As in make another USB drive as a back-up?

I need a TV and I need this to happen

Thank you! I reset the block chain and I lost another .7 BTC from my wallet so I was a little worried.  I updated to the newest version and the reset was successful in giving the correct balance
