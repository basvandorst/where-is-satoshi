Did it for a week. Then decided 50 cents of Monero wasn't worth risking my job.

My friends and I have always used mBTC as our default unit, since most of our transactions fall in the 5 USD - 40 USD range.

Upvoting this for raising a very interesting point: "Could a [malicious entity] make bitcoin unusable if they block the network with a couple of billion $$ worth of spam transactions?" 
I'm not quite knowledgeable enough to answer this, and I would like to hear thoughts on it.

I think that's exactly what OP was getting at...

I had a lot of your same concerns, and I can share the safety systems that I use.
First, I'll note that it is NOT a huge deal if your Trezor is damaged or stolen. As long as you saved your seed, you can simply buy a new Trezor, set it to your seed, and have full access to your wallet. If it is stolen, the thief will not have your private pass/pin and cannot access your funds. Of course, in either event, you'll lose the cost of a new Trezor, but that's not the end of the world.
Regarding recovery in the event that something happens to me... My partner and I have separate finances, and do not share passwords/accounts with each other. I have a safe deposit box (~ 30 USD per year, very cheap for the peace of mind) that only I have access to. In the event of my death, they will be able to access it.
I made a google spreadsheet that lists the places that I have coins stored, which email address is associated, the 2-factor authentication service, a ballpark estimate of assets there, and any other notes relevant to recovery.
I have all of my seeds and passwords (Trezor, 2-factor authentication services, wallets) in the safe deposit box. If I pass away, my S.O. can use the seeds &amp; passwords in the safe deposit box to clone my 2FA methods and access the wallets. 
We sat down and discussed where the recovery information was distributed and the steps that would need to be taken to retrieve the assets. In this way, I know that coins can be retrieved post-mortem, but I do not give up any privacy or incur the risk of trusting a third party.

I'm going to have all long-term BTC in cold storage by 25-July (which is excessively early, I think). I may keep a little bit on the exchanges (or may buy a little bit) just to be an opportunist, but will cap it at &lt; 5% of my overall crypto portfolio since I'm aware that it's dicey situation and I risk losing it a few different ways. 
Risk tolerance is the name of the game :- )

My friends and I use bitcoin the same way most people use Venmo. Tossing a few dozen mBTC around to pay back somebody who covered a meal or gasoline or something. We got Thai food last weekend and paid the store directly in BTC. I haven't gotten mixed up in any dark web trafficking rings or anything. :- )
(I do also have some BTC in cold storage for long-term investing, but I also have a CoPay wallet that I use for day-to-day transactions.)
As a side note: way more guns, drugs, and child porn are bought in USD than in BTC... SWIM knows a weed dealer that takes BTC, but most in my area still prefer USD as the anonymous and difficult-to-trace currency for illicit activities.

Fantastic job! This is the most clear and succinct explanation I've seen that can be absorbed in &lt; 2 minutes. A good comic is worth 1k words. 
A very minor note: the characters "CD" show up in both hashes of the "When we put..." panel. I did not find the this unclear, however somebody trying to understand it for the first time might get a little confused seeing the repeated substring.

I've used a Digital Mint ATM in a gas station near my house. Took 2 minutes to verify, fed in some cash, had the $$ in my personal wallet within moments. Pretty smooth process! Required a receiving address, but otherwise didn't take any technical skills.
I don't use it regularly since I buy with much lower fees from a big exchange, but I was excited to try it, and it seems like a good point of entry for new users.

I think that might protect against some attacks, but not all. 
For instance that it would help: if malicious code were to try to execute sell functions THROUGH the wallet software, perhaps the 2FA lock would prevent the final signing of the transaction.
For instance that it wouldn't help: If malicious code were to find a way to extract the private keys or seed from where your wallet software stores them, then they could access your coins with any wallet software on any device, which bypasses 2FA. (though really, this is true for electronic wallets on any device)

My understanding is that GBTC hasn't done a great job of actually tracking the price of BTC, and is currently way too expensive. 
I worry that if I purchase GBTC right now (at almost 2x the price that it should be) this scenario seems plausible: actual price of BTC doubles &amp;/or GBTC halves its price to actually follow the value of the asset, then I'd be back at square 0.
I'd be OK with paying a 10% (mayyyybe 20%) premium for the convenience of buying btc-related asset through Fidelity to "set and forget" ... But since I'm perfectly capable of managing my own keys I'm not interested in paying double.
That being said, I'm keeping some USD on the sideline in Fidelity in case the impending chaos causes a correction that brings GBTC into a proper price regime.
(this is all from my recollection last time I investigated GBTC a while ago. I would welcome clarification from either somebody that knows BTC better, or knows the markets/mechanics around GBTC better)

Here is the answer from bitcoin.org 
So officially, you could wait until 31-July. However, unless you have a particular reason that you need to do so, I'd say to just do it now (why wait?)
If you are moving from one of your own wallets to a paper wallet, you could probably wait until the last minute. However, BEWARE: If you are moving your coins from an exchange, you have to also take into account that their system could introduce a delay that puts you beyond the deadline. Last week when everybody started pushing their coins off the exchanges, Coinbase had a long delay on all outgoing BTC withdrawals. My withdrawal txn wasn't announced to the blockchain for many hours. (I think that this is because Coinbase keeps ~98% of their coins in cold storage, and when everybody made a run on the cryptobanks, it quickly depleted their hot wallets). Expect that this could easily happen again - you don't want to be stuck in that terrible limbo with a fork looming.

I ordered a Trezor to the US about 2 weeks ago. With the express option, it shipped in 2 days  (after the weekend) and arrived at my door 3 days later (~5d total).

I agree... its value and utility are intrinsic, and imho independent of its source.

Cool idea; I dig it. What would differentiate your mining co-op from a cloud farm like Hashflare.io? I can essentially vote by selecting how my hashing power is distributed between pools. 
Are you thinking that instead of selling shares of hashrate, you'd sell shares of the company, and hashrate/share would increase as the company scales? I'd find this a somewhat more attractive option.
Disclaimer to avoid well-intentioned replies: Yes, I know lots of (or most of) cloud mining operations are scams or ponzi schemes. I take precautions such as promptly moving the mined coins to personal wallets (for which only I have the keys). I'm appropriately skeptical and don't trust cloud anything as far as I can throw it.

I use BTC for food, contracting coding work, purchasing software, etc. I hold some as a commodity, but it largely functions as a currency for me. Merchants can use systems such as bitpay that convert the BTC holdings to USD on a same-day basis, so that they aren't exposed to price fluctuations. (e.g. a menu item costing 19.99 EUR will result in 19.xx EUR in the restaurant bank account that night, regardless of whether the intermediate value was 5 mBTC or 50 mBTC)

It doesn't seem like Satoshi has taken a lot of risks? She's incredibly deliberate and cautious, as OP highlights.

IIRC, Coinbase purchases from bank via ACH take about a week. *However, purchases from debit card are delivered instantly.* 
(I've had an account set up there for a while, so maybe it's different for new users).

Is bitcoin a *safe* investment? No.
Is it a great investment if you acknowledge that cryptocurrencies are a risky asset class, determine your financial risk tolerance, and purchase only what you can afford to lose? I strongly believe so.
Sure, I believe that cryptocurrencies are going to topple traditional economies yadda yadda yadda, and I suspect/hope/believe that the coins will have great buying power by the time I want to spend my investments a few decades by now. But I hedge my bets and also invest in some classical assets (usual: mutual funds, a few ETFs, etc). 
The usual rules apply: Don't put all your eggs in one basket (or exchange!) and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

This is a bit of an overstatement. I'm invested heavily in bitcoin because I see an excellent and revolutionary technology that I expect to gain a lot of traction and spending power. That doesn't necessarily mean that I think all of the world markets and centralized banking are going to implode.

BTC-e was an online cryptocurrency exchange, where people could trade fiat (e.g. US dollars, Euros, etc) for a handful of different crypto coins (e.g. bitcoin, litecoin,. etc). 
It had been up since 2011, and I had thought it was relatively reputable.
