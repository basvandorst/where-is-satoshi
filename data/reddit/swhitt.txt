Howdy howdy howdy from Texas. You are a very generous Santa. Maybe I'll do the same with a few mined coins. 
Anyways, my address is 1721itFZkEoLEXyfLNJdY92NF7NRpzGSip. Thanks!

You should consider trying blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:46:12
1. It uses flash.
2. It requires a login (which for a bitcoin site makes me think they are phishing for passwords).
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:51:03
No, this isn't how instawallet worked. There was a *completely non-related to the bitcoin address* unique identifier generated for each wallet. 
You could not go to /w/&lt;bitcoin address&gt; and access the funds. That would be silly.
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:14:59
Yes, there are a few folk that will handle transactions like that immediately if you drop over to Bank of America / Wells Fargo / Chase and do a deposit; 2-4% above spot and completely anonymous. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:16:51
It sells at whatever the highest bid is when your order is executed.

Please don't do this, it makes bitcoiners look like douche-supreme.
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:47:52
Yeah, the post I linked to on Hacker News was actually that guy (or someone who did the exact same thing). Someone on  just mentioned that there used to be 500 BTC on a brainwallet with the passphrase of "bitcoinisawesome". That would have been quite a devastating loss.
@_date: 2013-03-11 17:53:39
The recommended fee these days is 0.0005 BTC / 500 bytes or part thereof. 0.0005 BTC is about $0.024 right now with 1 BTC ~= $48 USD. You can view the transaction sizes on blockchain.info to get an idea about what that means.
If you have a previous version of bitcoin installed it will probably keep the settings you had for it when you upgrade. However, if you install bitcoind/bitcoin-qt fresh (remove all settings from all previous versions), you can see this in the preferences screen as a 0.001 BTC/kB default. You can also change it via the jsonrpc interface (or, hell, you could do it by crafting raw transactions via the new raw transaction interface if you're feeling nifty).

Actually the photos in the article were taken by the author of the article. That's a picture of a Jalapeño in the new case. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:45:51
Yeah, you are applying rules for other wallets to blockchain.info, which works differently. It either uses the address you're sending from as the change address or it uses another non-archived address that is already in your wallet as the change address. 
It does not behave like Bitcoin-Qt or several other wallets which generate (either randomly, taken from an address pool or deterministically) a new change address for each transaction. If he was only using blockchain.info to manage his BTC and the funds are not in his main or archived addresses, then he's SOL. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:02:45
You're technically correct, which is the best kind of correct :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:12:33
Except that every site using CloudFlare and HTTPS has to give ***their https certificate*** to CloudFlare. And most of the big Bitcoin exchanges use CloudFlare. Single point of failure eh?

What's an "a
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:58:09
No they won't. It always takes several days for bank transfers in the United States. Until that problem is fixed it will always take days to turn USD in your bank account into BTC. Gox with Dwolla takes the same amount of time. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:42:08
No. Instawallet was only accessible over https (which is encrypted). In this case, all your ISP knows is that you are hitting instawallet.org over SSL.
@_date: 2013-02-25 22:15:52
Yeah, I believe the bot is attempting to cause SDICE to lose money, possibly one of the folk that like to call it a DDOS on the blockchain. 
I was messing around with some small bets the other day and a group of about 10 of the bots' rebets made it into a block. I ended up about 2 btc thanks to the bot, but it sure felt like cheating. Imagine if the bot paired with ASICMINER or one of the other high-powered mining groups; the miners could selectively choose bet transactions to include in their blocks.
@_date: 2013-02-13 20:38:39
Just sign something like "I am anon_bitcoin_gambler" using the address that you are holding all of your cash in.

Keep clam and carry on.

I actually immediately did this after I figured out what had happened (while holding back tears).
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:27:40
It's just as unlikely to happen as having a collision in the addresses of regularly-generated keypairs.
@_date: 2013-03-17 22:29:06
No, definitely not. What happens if they get hacked? Do you even have a copy of your own private keys?
My current solution is to generate a lot of paper wallets and add them as watch-only in blockchain.info. That means that no one can spend the coins without the private keys on those paper wallets, but you can still maintain a good overall view of your bitcoinwealth.

There's a bot out there which resends your SatoshiDICE losing bet transactions with an additional OP_ZERO before your signature. This part doesn't need to be signed but it does change the transaction id. It's trying to make SDICE lose money via a doublespend attack.
SDICE typically ignores these bets but sometimes the second bet makes it into a block.
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:10:21
Are you guys on the OTC web of trust / active on BitcoinTalk? It would do a lot to make me (and many others) comfortable entrusting you with cash money.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:25:32
Nope, unfortunately you can't. The priority of the transaction will increase over time though (the older the input coins get, the higher priority the transaction is). 
Eventually a miner should pick it up (or you can rebroadcast the transaction to try again).
@_date: 2013-05-09 05:25:20
I'm considering doing this at cost for bitcoins. Any chance you can share with me the dimensions of your stamps to make things a little easier before I head to a local stamp store and start prototyping? 
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:12:27
Holy shit. This is not some conspiracy, nor is it surprising. Reddit JUST STARTED accepting bitcoin for reddit gold on February 14th. They're using Coinbase, which means that yeah they take BTC for payment but it is immediately converted into fiat when they get your payment. It wasn't some trivial checkbox that they had to check in order to work bitcoin into their infrastructure, someone had to rework the payment gateway code to handle Coinbase.
I bet that it's just as difficult to do this for their ad network. And I bet they make a lot less money selling ads then they do selling gold, plus they get a lot less exposure for it. This is the exact thing that OTC is for! Check out [the web of trust](  on freenode or just hit me up via PM to learn more.
Let's work with the system and slowly get it to change, not get into feuds about it :)

Well, you can specify fixed-length palindromes using regexes.

So much for [Responsible Disclosure]( huh?
@_date: 2013-03-11 17:57:37
It also can have to do with the priority of the transaction (really old aged coins usually don't need fees) and the size of the transaction (mostly influenced by the number of inputs / outputs you have).
If you've been playing satoshiDICE a lot you probably have a bunch of 1-5 satoshi and other small lose-confirmation outputs that get swept up sometimes and bloat your transactions. Paying that fee is a good tax to clean up the litter that SDICE leaves :)
@_date: 2013-02-25 22:20:39
Things like this make me nervous - you will now have whomever uses your blocks trusting them entirely.
It might be a good idea to have a trusted third party GPG sign the files so we know that there is a lower chance of manipulation.
@_date: 2013-03-17 22:31:40
An even more secure way of using blockchain.info is to keep most of your funds in a paper wallet, but add them as watch-only addresses on blockchain.info. That way you can keep an eye on your funds without trusting blockchain.info with the private keys. 
Keep a separate address on there with 2-3 btc for everyday spending that you wouldn't mind losing if everything got compromised. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:48:02
Nope, unfortunately blockchain.info does not generate new change addresses for each transaction like Bitcoin-Qt. It either uses the address you're sending from or another address you already have in your wallet. 
Also, importing one private key into Bitcoin-Qt will not give you access to all of the change addresses. Each wallet.dat has its own pool of (100 by default) change addresses that are generated individually.

This only happened because there was no liquidity on the btc-e BTCEUR exchange. He literally ate up all of the orders until it was down to €1.

Edit for formatting!
1. No. The typical "wall streeter" is COMPLETELY stuck in their old ways. My dad is at the end of his career and I don't think he's changed his investment philosophy since 1981 
2. That is an excellent question. Given that the smallest company in the S&amp;P 500 is something around $4 billion (I think) and many investors still haven't heard of every company in that. The reality is, it would need to be large. I would estimate somewhere between $15-20 billion. *(That number is coming directly out of my ass)*.
3. Well to be honest - we have so many internal new sources. Our company has a 24/7 channel on our computers of internal news. A lot of people watch CNBC, not because they think it's valid - but because it's what most our clients list to and we like to know what they follow.
4. At this point the barriers to entry are to high for your savvy investor. Create a mtgox account, a btc-e account, use bitinstant with dwolla. Or try to get on the WOT in the OTC market?? Man I just don't see it happening. There are so many "micro" markets all over the world aside from bitcoins. There needs to be both a support for scalability as well as liquidity and I don't see bitcoins showing either of those two as of now.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:27:50
This is not bitcoinity's issue, it's MtGox's. The issue stems from their websockets API not being able to handle the massive numbers of people using it and from the fact that their trading engine is 5-10 minutes lagged behind real-time.

Would you be sad or angry if I borrowed this idea?

Neither, they just started taking BTC for gold last month and it was a huge deal. They have to get comfortable with this first before they start integrating bitcoin into their other processes. 
@_date: 2013-02-24 22:45:32
I believe evoorhees said that they now wait for confirmed coin before replying to bets if their hotwallets get low on reserves. They also have  heuristics in place that prevent your bets from being immediately replied to (they wait for a confirmation) if your playing habits look like they might be risky.
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:49:50
Well, compared to some of the other "big losses" you read about here and on bitcointalk you're right. 
For me, however, this is quite a bit. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:53:58
That's funny, I sent 0.0001 BTC to the address again and added a message to the transaction using blockchain.info's "Public Note" feature asking for the money back. 7 minutes after you posted the real passphrase [this guy]( took it :)
