But if a bad actor owns 51% they can continue modifying the last few blocks of the chain delaying, inserting, then removing transactions. So you can assume that a transaction you see was really signed by someone who controls the private key, but how can you assume the transaction is valid if 30 minutes later it's removed after being part of the Blockchain (which in case from a network perspective the transaction no longer being there is still valid because its part of the chain with the most hash power / longest that's been accepted by all the nodes on the network)

I think a bad actor could do something nasty because as long as they hold 51% than can not only delay transactions but continue rewriting the last few blocks of the chain for double spend attacks as well as other confusion of continuing to include and exclude transactions on the chain.

Here is the evidence:
Dan Larimer (CEO of Invictus) is ByteMaster. Says you were referred to him by Adam B. Levine from LTB. Unless your ANOTHER 'Super3' ?

Thanks the first part of your comment is the best explanation I've read thus far on the value and dynamics of the trust piece, not sure what point your making with the second half on the response to the generals problem though.

Was hoping for more technical annotations towards the bottom of the white paper. Couple of questions i've been thinking about:
What cryptographic algorithm is used for digital signatures? RSA? I know SHA-256 is used for cryptographic hashing.
