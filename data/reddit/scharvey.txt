May I suggest buying tulips? I hear they're a can't lose investment.

Until the price of Bitcoin/crypto I general stabilizes it's worth WAY more to investors than it is as a currency. 
It is still useful as a $ proxy for p2p transfers around the globe, but only while it's also easily convertible back into local currency.
That may change in the future or it may not.

If there's an opportunity to make quick money people are going to take it. 
I'm really not sure what your complaining about at the moment. Too many people selling as the price drops and then other people buying low to drive the price back up? That's how markets work.

What price do you need to break even?

Should've invested in worldstar instead.

Tldr: have an investment plan, don't just speculate on crypto or other investments blindly

What price did you buy in at?
If lower than current price and you want to not worry about it anymore then cash out.
If higher than current price then you have to decide if you want to cash out and take an actual loss or ride it out knowing that currently it's just a theoretical loss.

This is idiotic.  A dollar is still worth a dollar too, but both a Bitcoin and a dollar have a relative value to things you can exchange them for.
Today a Bitcoin might be worth a lambo and tomorrow a pizza.
Saying that 1btc = 1btc means literally nothing.

Or just don't buy more than you care to have instantly disappear.

It's funny how people see things in a way that aligns with their world view.
I'd say blame the party that controls both houses with leadership unwilling to negotiate ever and had a president that refused to sign a bipartisan bill that they did manage to get to him.

Is his price fixed to Bitcoin or does he simply convert his USD price to Bitcoin for each gig and charge that?
If the latter then he's not really doing anything different than any other DJ except he makes clients convert their money into Bitcoin before paying him.

Short answer: No
Long answer: Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Not to mention that you already can buy bitcoins. There are more exchanges than I can count on one hand.
Also the currency may be up recently, but it crashed hard in the past and has been riddled with hacking and theft.

This makes zero sense.
Money you pay them doesn't just go into some hodling account. They don't give a shit that the money you would have paid them back then is worth more now, because they would have already used that to pay their own bills and if they accepted your Bitcoin they just would have immediately converted it to their normal currency so that they could spend it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:54:07
It makes sense because you're buying currency. Can't have it both ways.

Do you say this as an investor, a user/consumer, or developer?
