If bitcoin were at 20k, there’s no doubt in my mind that the altcoins exclusively featured on coinbase will be double what they are now.
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:02:17
This is the result of bitcoin going down from 13.1 to now 12.3

I find the contrary, bitcoin goes down, they go down. If bitcoin goes up, they shoot up. They are just nowhere near on the level of bitcoin and it’s resistance levels. Their prices are cheaper and even a slight decrease in them can be detrimental whereas bitcoin can go down a thousand dollars and no one will bat an eye.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:55:34
Lol btc goes down $700 from 13.1  and all the alt coins act like they just saw Mussolini.

We hit 13 again and the alts featured on coinbase exclusively will follow (increase)
@_date: 2019-07-04 20:53:38
Just wanted to point out that if you buy one whole bitcoin now and buy 12k worth of any of the alts on coinbase, you very well could have that one bitcoin for free. Let me reiterate, you buy one btc for 12k, spend another 12k on any alt that is EXCLUSIVELY on coinbase, and when bitcoin has its point where it’s above 20k, sure as hell the alt coins that are EXCLUSIVELY ON COINBASE will double or very well triple in value by then. You then sell off your alts (if you want) and then what you had paid for that bitcoin(12k) has already been recouped. Free bitcoin!! (This happened in 2017 of December, as bitcoin reached 19k, ethereum was $1,000, litecoin was $230, XRP was $3, Bitcoin cash was $3,000, Ethereum Classic was $40. Those prices are at the fraction of the cost right now. If those were the prices when bitcoin was at 19k, what do you think they would be when bitcoin is over 25k??

Just buy now, if you look at the lowest points of the year for bitcoin price from 2015 to now you’d see that it is increasing. That’s just me though, I look at the lowest points instead of the ath. Hope this helped...

This is what will happen, 10k at midnight.

Good morning, Ethereum classic would like to hold on to Bitcoins pocket if thats alright?
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:19:21
I can’t speak about the alts that are NOT on coinbase, but the ones that ARE will literally explode after bitcoin reaches 15k and on.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:41:46
Yes, but everything seems more intensified/amplified since bitcoins in the five digits range now.
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:29:52
I personally theorize that the coins featured on coinbase will succeed and increase substantially as bitcoin nears 20k. If you go back to December 2017 -January 2018 data,(where bitcoin hit 19k)  it shows that happened.
 Ethereum went to $1,000,
 litecoin to $230, 
and ethereum Classic to $40.
 Ripple to $3, 
and bitcoin cash to $3,000.
As of now Ethereum is $300
Litecoin is $140
Ethereum Classic is $9
Ripple is 47 cents
Bitcoin cash is $430
 I believe it is inevitable that these coins will have a modern 2019 parallel to what happened when bitcoin reached its ath. But this time it’s different, it seems that we’re moving at a faster pace and a ath of above 20k seems more and more likely if you compare bitcoins progress every two months for the last 6 months. This insinuates that those precious prices listed above for alt coins could very well be higher if bitcoin goes over 20k. Win win situation, more and more people familiarize theirselves with bitcoin as the price goes up, more people start to get involved in bitcoin and therefore alt coins, specifically those on coinbase as coinbase seems to be the go to platform for new investors and quite possibly a large chunk of this forum as well.

Coming from someone who has bitcoin and alt coins only featured on coinbase, everything is more than great as bitcoin is going up to be honest.. for all the other shitcoins not on coinbase, who gives a flying f**k about them!
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:08:11
This is a baby dip. I praise those that have hodld the 20k to 3.5k dip

@_date: 2019-06-26 08:42:31
What website is this??
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:03:45
I don’t believe any alt coins will ever come near to the price of bitcoin ever. What I do firmly believe is that the prices of this alt coins we see now will be at least double or triple in the future whether it be near or not. It’s not like altcoins will all hit zero if bitcoin hits 100k for example. Crypto popularity will continue to grow and people will resort to getting more bang for their buck with alt coins that they could afford more quantity. I’m all for bitcoin, all for alt coins that are exclusively on coinbase. The “slain” aspect will be apparent not through all those alt coins going to zero but through the contrast in price to bitcoin. Bitcoin will always be most valuable. Unfortunately the higher it gets the less likely an individual is to obtain a full single bitcoin. I’m aware any talk about altcoins is an eyesore in this forum but in regards to the ones exclusively featured on coinbase, I don’t believe they should be looked at as inferior. They are instruments of value and are little ponies compared to the stallion well known as bitcoin but have tremendous potential. They are to coexist with each other and I can confidently say at this point of time the stallion influences growth of other alts.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:24:56
FOR ALL THE NEWCOMERS, I PROMISE YOU THAT CHANGES IN PRICE LIKE THIS ARE NORMAL. IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS OF THE FUTURE OF BTC JUST LOOK AT THE ALL TIME LOWS OF EACH YEAR FROM 2015 TO NOW. THE PRICE HAS ALWAYS INCREASED. HODL

I don’t know why, but something tells me that when Warren Buffett has that talk with Justin Sun  he will suddenly change his mind about his feelings toward crypto currency. Imagine this man goes from saying bitcoin is “rat poison squared” to saying it is genius publicly... all hell will break loose. Yesterday he claimed he overpaid for his stake in Heinz and minutes later the stock price declined. Let’s say in a utopian world Buffet says Bitcoin is genius and worth buying...the price will skyrocket almost instantly as the media gets ahold of those news. Just saying. 
Also for those who don’t know, Justin Sun bid $4 million dollars for an hour lunch with Buffet where he will be inviting nine other guests specifically involved in crypto. This will occur in mid to late July I believe?
