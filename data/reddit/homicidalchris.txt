With BTC something like that would be much less likely to happen in the first place, but on the other hand, if someone DOES steal your wallet then you're just boned.  So they both have pros and cons in this case.

You know, the post you replied to is kinda douchey, but wow, this post is fucking hilarious.  


You GUARANTEE it?  Do you know the poster's character personally, or are you just making the blanket assertion that anyone who has an opportunity to steal will?  Do you have a study backing that shit up? Hilarious.     


Using rhetorical devices and a Socratic "I know nothing" attitude to dismiss the possibility that it's common knowledge that robbing the shit out of people is a moral negative?  While at the same time dressing up the complete lack of an ethical philosophy as some kind of thoughtful nihilistic worldview?  Hilarious if not kind of awesome.   


Publicly admitting that you'd steal if you could get away with it, then trying to rationalize it by saying that you know for a fact everyone else would do the exact same thing?  Calling someone who *isn't* a thief a "fool"?  Hilarious.  


So people who *don't* steal thousands of dollars are "just as bad" as people who do for taking a moral stand against unjustly depriving people of their property?  I mean, yeah, technically, morality is subjective but not stealing a shitload of money from your neighbor just because you can get away with it is more or less accepted as an axiom of modern human societies.
