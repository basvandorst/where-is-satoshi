An item is $100, so you pay the merchant $100
- pay with CC and the merchant receives $97
- pay with LN and the merchant receives $99.99
Why would they pay a CC fee *and* a LN fee if you're only paying using one of the two?
Just sit and think about this for a minute

basic risk management is have a stop sell with every open long position

You know what, you're totally right. I'm so used to post-only mode for limits, I didn't realize that limit orders that aren't post-only may "take" at the current market price
So, if the price right now is 15,000 and i made a limit sell (not post-only) 0.01btc at 14,500, it'd get filled at market price and i'd be charged a taker fee, not necessarily at 14,500, right?
So a side-effect of this is that traders are protected from accidentally typing, say, sell 1btc at $1. Because it'd get filled at market?
Thanks for clearing this up

yeah we need fast, cheap payments, 
then we need some kind of price stability
and even then, there's more incentive to pay with something that depreciates (USD) than something that appreciates (BTC)
but in the future, i can see this being more common

- vendors sometimes offer discounts when paying cash, they might do this with BTC/LN
- more convenient compared to cash 
- inflationary, not deflationary currency
- (see other benefits of btc / decentralized crypto)

basically, crypto is good because it can offset natural power plants when they're not operating at peak (think hydro or wind, they'll only need 50% capacity 90% of the time)
for areas where it wouldn't be worth setting up a hydro or wind plant, mining with excess power could offset the cost and lower the barrier of entry for less dense areas

highly recommend adding a stop-loss at like 90% your buy in value
scoot it up as the price goes up (or using a trailing stop-loss if your exchange has it)
i would have sold BTC at 19,000 and LTC at 400 if i was properly using stop-losses. Regret.

Yup, but the coinbase fee is way higher
Plus with a limit order a penny below market price you'll pay zero fees
But yeah, a lot can happen in the days it takes for ach to clear
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:44:55
stop losses ya'll
i know some think crypto is way more volatile than stocks / forex but
basic risk management is to add a stop loss to every open order
buying long? add a stop sell in case it tanks the moment you buy
selling short? add a stop buy in case it takes off the moment you sell

[here's my simple TA](
looks like a [falling wedge](
i think our btc discount is about to end, here's hoping we're on our way up! some people are saying it'll find resistance at 15k, not super sure
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:10:09
You can with GDAX, theyre the same company. Your login is the same too. Just fund your gdax account with coinbase (free and instant). Then go to tradeview BTC/USD and go to the stop tab, put in the amount of btc and when it should sell, lowest. Then as the btc price increases, change the stop to go up and follow it
That way your limit your risk
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:38:06


@_date: 2018-01-06 06:34:12

I think we're on the way up

nice. i've removed tickers from my phone/laptop after the stress of yesterday
just going to add a &gt; 15k alarm and carry on
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:38:57
So, I think this is the confusion (probably my own confusion here) 


This I agree with. 
Market price is 15,000 and your limit order is for 14,500
So in the case of PO option, your order wouldn't go through.
But you're saying that stop limit orders are *not* post-only, so you would take liquidity at market price up until 14,500? (and you'd be charged taker fees for whatever portion was taken at market, but not for the remainder that gets posted to the order book?)
So, the scenario I posted is wrong because stop limits are not post-only, right?
Thanks for chiming in!

i mean, if they outlawed crypto, then it'd be really hard to turn your fiat salary into crypto. you could find a guy locally who'll sell it to you, but he's risking a lot selling it, and you'd probably pay a huge premium
which actually would drive up the price of crypto
making it an even better store of value
so nevermind

i totally agree with you. honestly a stop at like 30% might be enough room for the volatility but would still probably get whipsawed off
but at the end of the day, i'd rather make some profit and miss out on more potential gains, instead of having paper gains at the ATH then holding down to 60% of its ATH value
you can always open another long position, but can you deal with seeing your portfolio drop 40%?

because its the first crypto currency with real scale, so it'll be the first to come up with solutions to scale (segwit and lightning). it's the main currency through which shitcoins are bought.

I have a single tracking account called "Coinbase/Bitstamp" that I keep updated with the current portfolio value of all my digital currency (btc, eth, ltc, xrp). 
I use an app called "Delta" on Android and log each purchase and sale on all my digital currencies. I open Delta once a day and reconcile the account to that number, and YNAB will automatically make an entry with the positive or negative amount
So it's really only helpful to know the USD value of my portfolio, I don't keep much more information in YNAB other than that. It's a little flawed in that the time of day that I reconcile the account, it could fluctuate down 10% in the next hour (unlike betterment, where you can reconcile at 5pm since trading stops), but it helps give a nice overview
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:34:13

coinbase has a 2% fee
and if you were considering buy with card it'd be higher
that could have got you from 15k to 15.7k

easiest way, go to coinbase.com, make an account, link bank account, buy btc

different exchanges' local users value BTC higher or lower. in venezuela it was at something like the double the intl rate or something. in the usa there's a slight premium on gdax/coinbase because of (in my opinion) their very good infrastructure and ease of use
there's a thing called arbitrage where you buy on one exchange and sell on another, but between tx fees and times, it's not very easy

@_date: 2017-12-07 22:05:46
think of coinbase as the bank.
- "you don't own bitcoin unless you own the keys"
- "you don't own any money if you don't have dollars in your hand"
you have a bank account and a balance at your bank. if they went insolvent, and wasn't fdic insured, you could lose all your money.
so this is basically saying, take your dollars out of the bank, and store them in your house/lockbox. it sounds crazy, but since all of your dollars can be represented by 64 characters, it's a lot easier than holding dollars
now, that said. do you trust your bank to do a better job at securing your money than you? if so, keep your money at the bank/coinbase. if you trust yourself more than you trust them, keep your money locally
so regarding uptake. the majority of people will keep their money on coinbase, or some other "bitcoin bank" and make transactions in and out of it, just like a bank account. even though everyone says move your btc to a local wallet, most people won't.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:59:23
? if his govt bans bitcoin, what's he to do? throw away the key?
in countries where weed is illegal, people go to amsterdam, do weed, and come home
why would btc in a btc-banned country be illegal if you're not using or "holding" btc in any way?
secondly, it's pretty obvious that these laws are simply outdated for digital currency. it would require a ban of data, which doesn't make sense either
here's a more eloquent person discussing it:
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:42:41
If you really think it's going to dip, short it! Ask to borrow someone's bitcoin for a fee of $500 or something. Immediately sell it. Then in three months time, buy a bitcoin at market price and return it
You could make a lot of money if this is a bubble and it pops
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:36:04

correct. regarding step 2, you can fund your account same day if you do a wire transfer. that includes a fee of $10 from gdax as well as whatever you bank charges (e.g. $25)
by funding using your bank account (ACH), it'll take 3-5 days
coinbase has the benefit of being able to buy using bank account (ACH) instantly (locking in the current price) as the cost of their 2% fee
so consider what amounts you're working with and time your timelines
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:30:24
- open up gdax: usd-btc
- go to the 6hr view
- go to overlays and turn on all EMA lines
now, when the price dips below the EMA12 line, it's a slight dip. when the price dips below the EMA26 line, it's a DIP. 
sounds pretty clear. the thing is, today's "too high to buy" will become tomorrows "dip." so most of the time it's better to just buy now

if you're thinking about buying, seems like right now is the dip. btc *tends* to do 2-3 days up, then 2-3 days down
and we're at the end of a down phase, so it should start to go up tomorrow
@_date: 2018-09-13 18:19:32
well the OP is deleted now but yeah if he original btc was sold for usd first that makes sense. i guess the cynic could say it's not fully realized since some of the btc could fluctuate downwards or something
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:47:20
the key word here is "realize"
he's speaking in USD, so it's not realized until he finally converts it back to USD, since volatility may dissolve those unrealized profits

wedges usually break at 70%, the later it breaks the strong it breaks usually. 
obviously who knows the direction (hopefully up), but a breakout should be soon, or maybe now
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:52:51
i think we're getting sidetracked here


i'm not argueing that that wouldn't or couldn't happen. what am i saying is that you're not smuggling anything tangible out of the country. what is bitcoin? it's everywhere. you have a private key, that allows you to record a transition of ownership, that's it
if you wanted to convert it to fiat in another country and bring it back, you could. is it techincailly illegal in a country that banned btc? maybe. 
would you argue that "these laws are *not* outdated for digital currency"? even if we agree that they're not outdated, we can at least agree that there is need for interpretation and clarity, and probably evolution, right?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:26:54
premiums because coinbase makes it so easy for people to buy, and when they buy, they pay the market price on coinbase, most people dont use gdax to offer prices
gdax is also ensured and licensed to run in all states in the usa (afaik). 
@_date: 2018-09-25 19:50:32
falling wedge is closing, only 2 weeks left. hoping we see capitulation in the next week. we're at like what 80% which means the breakout (if breaks out) should be strong
tl;dr - might go up might go down

You could diversify and spread your money across a few coins. Most people here aren't going to recommend dropping btc for bch though
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:21:51
go to coinbase.com, create account, buy like $100 worth of btc
maybe set up a monthly buy of like $200 or whatever percentage of your savings rate you want to invest with. (I do something like 70% traditional stocks/bonds and 30% digital currency)

@_date: 2018-08-02 19:59:16
you're right, it's trackable
the key is not to be identifiable in the entry or exit
if it's really important that you have zero paper trail, you need to buy coins using cash from someone. maybe a bitcoin atm, but if you use a credit card, there will probably be records
you could try to buy btc on coinbase with a credit card, send it to 10 different wallets and try your own washing and layering that way, but it's so simple for a computer to track the paths that it's barely worth doing
it does give you some plausability that you don't know the owners of the intermediate steps. "yeah i sent some to a guy for a steam item," "i paid for a book," "i lent some btc to someone who was in trouble." then if those addresses then were to purchase something nefarious, it would be hard to prove that you owned the address that did the final purchase

more financially sound ideas would be
1. make and stick to a budget [ and 2. make sure you have 3 months expenses or at least 1k in cash an emergency fund
3. make sure you're getting your employer retirement match if available
4. start and contribute to retirement / pension account
then with left over cash, after savings towards your short and long term goals like a house downpayment or outstanding debt, you can invest.
and of that money you invest, 90&amp; of it should be in traditional vehicles like stock indexes and bonds. with the other 10&amp; yes, you could buy L40 of btc every few weeks
seriously with how volatile it is, don't expect to see profits or be able to pull cash out for years. in reality you'll probably see a profit in 6 months (we hope) but you should be prepared to lock it up for years if we enter a big bear market

@_date: 2017-11-27 18:23:15
dont't forget that btc is mined using real power that was paid for. there is a certain floor of value that people would no longer sell at. and as the difficulty increases, that's going to be more kwh per btc. 
if you paid 12$ in kwh for the 0.001 btc you mined, you're probably not going to want to sell it for less than 12$ 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:01:01
Yeah no one is kicking themselves for buying at 4700 instead of 4600. You're fine!
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:12:33
There is an intrinsic value, the kwh used to mine it. Why would someone spend 100khw to mine some btc, then sell it at a price lower than the price he paid for 100kwh?
Secondly, alternative coins do interesting things, too. For instance ripple is used by banks and is centralized, thats an interesting idea that i invested in
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:11:40
i dont think normal users would do all that. i think abstracting it away like how coinbase is doing it is the way
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:15:20

in the early days, btc was attractive because you could easily and cheaply exchange money around the world
now exchange fees are high, but the value is that of investment; the chance of it increasing in market value is very high
if the market price for btc were to "crash," what would be the intrinsic value? it'd be more expensive to exchange that fiat (locally, anyway). 
i guess scarcity over time? and being backed by kwh?

@_date: 2017-11-27 18:27:13
you can buy 0.001 btc if you want. that's about $9
that 0.001 btc will probably be worth $11 in january
now just scale that up with how much you have extra to invest
really, i just set up a $150 per month investment at coinbase. the actual number of "bitcoins" is irrelevant. 
similarly to stocks how you don't have to buy a full stock of apple. you can just invest $80 in a fund and own a percentage of shares

The rate of bitcoins created per day slows until it hits the cap of 21 mil coins
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:17:21
that means that a lot of people want to sell at a higher-than-market price. 
if BTC market price is $10,000
then a lot of people will have a sell price (red area) of $11,000 so they can make a profit. but not a lot of people will buy at $11,000, which is why it's so large
likewise, a lot of people want to buy btc at $9000 (green), since it's below market value, and a lot of people are waiting for the price to dip to $9000 when they'll buy. this is less than market value, so that's why the size gets bigger the lower the price is, because there's not a lot of buyers at that price
for instance, there was a screenshot that says "Dracarys" the other day that showed a huge red wall at $10,000. meaning a lot of people had sell orders at $10,000 because 1) it'd be an all time high but especially 2) it's a nice round number
so instead of a supply vs demand, you're seeing the prices at which people want to buy and sell

use something like the RSI (relative strength index) or other tools to help make more informed decisions. if you're reason for selling is a "feeling" then you're probably going to get hurt

@_date: 2018-04-20 15:21:22
You can look at the relative strength index. If its like 80 or 90, we're probably topping
Secondly you can add a stop loss to guarantee profits. When its quite high, set a stop loss like 500 below current price (or use the average true range) and keep moving it up as the price increases. You can get close to the top this way.
But theres no guarenteed way to sell the top and buy the bottom. Just either hodl for years or add stop losses when you have good profits. Don't be too greedy or else you'll probably ride it all the way down again

@_date: 2018-04-14 02:32:48
- when you "open a long position" is when you buy bitcoin, say at 10k
- you should then make a "stop loss" which limits your losses. you'd say... "sell if it goes below 9.5k" 
- the atr (average true range) is a number which shows how much the price fluctuates in the last week or so
so if you open a position now at 10k, and the atr is $500 lately, you could make a stop loss at 9.5k
obviously if the price goes down to 9.5k, you've just lost $500, but it's better than watching the price drop to 6k, right?
if the price goes up to 11k, you could move your stop loss up to 10.5k, guaranteeing at least $500 profit. this is called a "trailing stop". if the price goes up to 12k, you could move your stop loss up to 11.5k 
this is one way of guaranteeing profits while limiting losses. this is like, rule zero of trading

transaction fees incentivize miners. tons of side chain action i imagine will happen, though. on-chain transactions might left for side chain to on-chain movement. imagine visa uses lightning or some other side chain, then makes transactions onto the chain periodically with decent fees. 
otherwise big banks or processors around the world might become the miners since they have interest in keeping the ledger complete and correct.
of course, you'll be able to own your coins and make on chain transactions, but the vast majority of people will look to others to manage their money
