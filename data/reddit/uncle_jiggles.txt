That's my plan I only bought Bitcoin to hold. I am not interested in day trading.

OP you're probably better off asking in r/cryptocurrency
You will get downvoted for asking basic questions because people in this sub are assholes. Instead of helping people that need answers they'd rather shit all over you. Hate to be a Debbie downer but this sub isn't the best like at all.
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:49:22
I'm not saying your wrong or anything but what makes you confident with the 85% chance? I have a feeling that Bitcoin is going to get popular especially in this day in age.
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:01:20
That's my gameplan. However idk where I heard it from but I heard that the us government wanted to shut Bitcoin down. O guess my last question would have to be can a government shutdown a cryptocurrency? I find it impossible they can do that since it's literally an international currency. Btw thank you for replying to my stupid questions. Time in the market is always better than timing the market.

Yeah as somebody new to Bitcoin as well I bought $1,000 dollars worth of Bitcoin at 12,580. So trust me you're not the only ones that's sweating right now. But this is normal for Bitcoin is what people keep saying. Just hold it for a little while.

And then fall. And then rise again.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:46:23
I mean I knew it was risky but damn I didn't know it was like this.  I've bought 1,000 dollars worth of Bitcoin at 12.58k so I'm down like $9.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:49:31
Now if only I can purchase me some shrute bucks
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:17:14
As somebody that owns $40 in Bitcoin (just to dip my foot in the water) why kind of return would out expect me to get? So fabive made like 5 bucks within a week which is pretty goo compared to my other actual stocks like dell.
Edit: not too sure why I'm being downvoted..... Im genuinely asking questions because I don't know shit. What kind of sub community is this that shits all over new owners wanting to invest in Bitcoin? Really not cool man. Maybe instead of downvoting people with basic questions you, you know help them.

7 times to be exact. *A business model where people literally hand you their money and expect nothing in return. He still managed to fuck that up.*
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:35:05
True, fuck it I'm on the coaster might as well ride it. I'll let this $40 go and see what happens. As I've said before I've already made $5 within the first week which is already faster than all my other stocks.
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:35:12
Thanks! What's a good website or app to use only for Bitcoin? I keep hearing things about wallets and block chain and all this and I have no clue what any of it means. I don't have the need to spend Bitcoin because I don't shop with Bitcoin but in the future that option will become more available.
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:13:39
And that's what my hunch was telling me. The only reason why I asked was because I remember reading somewhere about how the us government can't collect taxes on Bitcoin like a normal stock does and so they wanted to shut it down. Which is just a dumb thing for any country to do. But I'm probably misremembering things.
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:21:37
Ahh man it's all good. I'm just now going to bed so I apologise for spelling and grammar errors. But yeah, I'll probably buy 1 or 2 Bitcoin and see where it goes.
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:58:14
Yeah, my plan is as soon as it gets above 12,500 cash out and then wait till it dips below 11,000 and then buy it again. I shouldn't have bought at 12,500.
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:23:43
Is $40 worth of Bitcoin even worth my time? I am new to investing and I recognize bitcoin as a legitimate currency but I have my doubts. I'm not gonna sink 11k, but I'd like to at least make a good chunk of money. Obviously you're not a fortune teller but is cryptocurrency going to be the next thing? 
I just don't know much about cryptocurrency and I'm wanting to know if it's going to stay and grow or if there's dangers such as government intervention and shutting down the whole thing.
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:25:05
Yeah,I'm relatively new to investing. I've got 5 stocks in a wide array of stocks from Dell, Walmart, weed stocks. But it's only worth about $700 and I've only invested $400. So in two years I've gained roughly $300 sonid consider that a good deal. Not perfect but it's better than being red. 
I just want to see what Bitcoin will do and I'll probably buy 1 or 2 coins to hold.
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:28:25
Unfortunately I use Robinhood. While it's not perfect it's convenient and it allows me to buy Bitcoin and other stocks. The weed stocks are kind of my albatross right now because I bought 11 shares for roughly $3 the company is called xxii and idk much about them but if it's weed it'll go up. They've been doing okay but I am in the red on those 11 shares.
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:50:17
Yeah, that's why I only sunk $40 in. However at some point I'd like to invest rough 100k if this is actually legitimate/not risky.
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:08:58
I wholely believe you're right. Imo I believe cryptocurrency is going to be the future. It's just I'm not a risk taker and I don't like uncertainty but you gotta play it like it is if you want to win. 
I don't believe I'll be a millionaire but if I can just have one or two bitcoins and hold onto that I'll be happy to see where it goes within the next 10 years.
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:11:05
While you're right, I do not know shit about cryptocurrency. I figured r/Bitcoin would be a good place to start by asking the people who use it what they think of this wonderful currency. The $100,000 isn't the issue it's the risks I'm looking at and the possibility of losing 100k
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:54:20
Hey you replied to my post the other day!
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:19:33
Just be thankful you didn't spend 30 Bitcoin on two pizzas back in early 2000's.
