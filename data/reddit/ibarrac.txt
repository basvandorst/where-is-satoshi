I'm working on a side project that is something very much like this, but using Python, not PHP. Don't know if I'll finish it, though.

I opened a new account on Coinbase.com and made my first purchase of 10 BTC on 4/2 at a price of around $116 for a total amount of $1170. I am sure that was the price I agreed to and expected. Instead, I got only 6.19 BTC on Monday April 8 after my bank transfer cleared. They gave me the market price on April 8 of around $190!
I am outraged because I was sure I got the price at the time I confirmed my order. It looks like they applied the new option to my transaction although they came up with it later and I never agreed to it. It may be that they made a mistake, so I sent a message to coinbase support yesterday. We'll see what they do.

I made the mistake of making a 10 bitcoin purchase with Coinbase.com on 4/2 when bitcoin was about $116. I don't remember checking any option to accept a future price. I was waiting for a few days to get my 10 bitcoin and to my surprise when the transaction completed a few days later, I only got around 6 at $190 per bitcoin. 
The worst thing is that I was nervous about the price so as soon as I made my purchase, I wanted to verify that I would get the $116 price and I was relieved to see this in their FAQ (it's still there):
[You lock in the price of your bitcoin right when you confirm the purchase!](
This is totally misleading if not an outright lie. When I got the $190 price a few days later I was outraged and emailed their support. They said there was nothing they could do. So I took my 6 BTC, closed my account and I will never do business with coinbase.com again.
I don't recommend Coinbase.com. They are at best, incompetent, if not downright irresponsible. How can they still have that FAQ answer there!
**If you insist in doing business with coinbase, never check the box to accept a future price when purchasing bitcoins.**

If the address was never used for any transactions, it would not be in the block chain, but someone could still be watching for it. It does seem rather unlikely unless you used very common words. Let's say the attacker has computed the addresses for all permutations of the 2000 most common English words. That would be 16*10^12 (16 trillion) addresses. To hold these and their private keys, they would need 20 bytes for the address and 32 bytes for the private key, or 823 terabytes. 
However, there are some optimizations they could make. They could just keep a 32-bit checksum or hash of the bitcoin address, and the sequence number of the word permutation to make a giant hash table. That would require just 4+6= 10 bytes per address, or 160 TB. Doable with a bunch of disks. They could also use only the top 1000 words and then would only need 10 TB.
Watching the blockchain is simple. They just listen to transactions as they happen, using an API or a hacked client. Every time they see one, they check the address with the giant hash table.
So which 4 words did you use? Were they common ones?
