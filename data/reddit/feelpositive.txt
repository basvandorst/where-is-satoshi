Isn't there still some absolute minimum requirement for mining to ensure the system works? If so, how much redundancy is there currently?

Someone's processing power has to be used for the transactions, no? I do understand that MOST miners contribute to the security of the system and not the flow, but there must be some critical amount where even with basically no security the few graphics cards can't process all the payments and movements of all the bitcoins on the network. Or am I completely wrong in this?

Unhelpful comment is unhelpful. 
If I wanted to do more self-educating, I would not be asking people who know more about the subject; I went to reddit because if something about the given explanation is unclear to me I can ask in the follow up, something less accessible in other media. Enjoy your 4 karma tho, you certainly deserve it... Really ask yourself if your comment improved anything other than your smug sense of superiority.

I understand where you're coming from, however: wikipedia is a conventional company and of course they're weary of any new stuff coming up. BTC to many people seems like a scam and to many others seems like an investment opportunity; only very few believe that it's actually currency-while it may become more widely used in the future when its price stabilizes, atm it's very hard to price your goods in a currency that fluctuates by 10-20% daily, 100% monthly.
From wiki's point of view, it would be similar to accepting apple stock, or Greek debt bonds, or a collection of rare historic gold coins; while certainly valuable, the value fluctuates and it can be a pain to exchange for dollars, especially if you want to hit the right time. Wikipedia is not exactly fond of HODL, I'm afraid.
So on this note, if you really wanted to support wiki, why not just sell the amount of bitcoin you would donate and donate the dollars to wiki? The same fee-money would be lost by you as by them, and they'd be happy to accept your donation.

Indeed but as I said, bitcoin now is not currency, it is a commodity to be sold. Or do you think wiki should have a dedicated bitcoin account and never sell (thus never triggering capital gains)?
Or am I missing something? Either way, 20% loss is what most traders go through anyway, and multiple times, so it doesn't seem to me to be such a big deal. Though ofc 12k $&gt; 10k $

That makes sense, thanks.

Most people who think I don't deserve a thing would simply not reply; you took your precious time to diss me TWICE instead of saying a single thing of substance.
By the way, read some of the other comments, they address my ignorance politely while also being very informative and concise - both of which you failed to do twice.
If I don't deserve a thing, I certainly don't want to fight for a reply back from you. Do us both a kind favor and fuck off.

I still don't think I completely get it, but I understand that there is lots of redundancy in the system as is, so the likelihood of it all coming down is nonexistent.
Thanks for your replies and time.

I have trouble believing that all the transactions could be handled by just one graphics card, considering how much it takes for the banks' servers (or any other servers for other stuff) to process transactions... But I do believe much less processing power is needed than current mining operations provide.
Considering security however, your reply makes absolute sense. At what point can we then say that there are not enough miners to be secure from a largescale hack attack (e.g. some government tries to hit bitcoin)? 
I'm mostly thinking into the far far future (2030?) when bitcoin prices have stabilized and mining is not only unprofitable at the moment, but it also doesn't seem to ever become more profitable.
Or will there still be enough bitcoin available for the few remaining miners that it covers their energy expenditure, and those few miners will provide enough security for the whole network?
Has it been suggested that when it's big enough, some governments/countries might support BTC by providing processing power, since it will be a stabilizing pillar of the economy?
Thanks for your replies.

What if there is too few miners to keep the network stable and working fast? Or will that virtually never happen?
I understand that the less miners, the more BTC for each; however, the less miners, the less security and perhaps slower transactions. (When) will that be a problem?

XP, 7 and Windows X are very decent operating systems, and the newest one - windows X is also secure... can't expect a 15 year old OS to hold up against modern hackers
