Exactly as you say, they explained they got into this because of the blockchain hype train which obviously stemmed from bitcoin.
And as a result they discovered neither bitcoin nor private blockchains work. So they're moving on. 
The actual root of this entire conversation come from the fact that it was mis-headlined that Barclays was somehow getting into bitcoin for its banking services. I pointed out that they weren't getting into bitcoin, a bitcoin company was getting into Barclays, and Barclays had no interest in getting into bitcoin for their banking services.

Fair enough as of about 24 hours ago, they aren't private blockchains. 
Seems more so of a technical shift, I'm finding it hard to be convinced what they have pivoted to does **not** qualify as a competitor to Bitcoin. What they started as private blockchains already is a step away from an open innovation/protocol/currency, those are hardly things they are concerned with.
@_date: 2016-04-07 01:34:34
Banks got into the hype wanting ledger and/or settlement system. R3 looked at bitcoin and offered banks their own thing, banks said yeah because they didn't want bitcoin which can do both. R3 tried private blockchains. R3 decided against private blockchains. R3 still doesn't want bitcoin. Banks don't want bitcoin. They want their-thing. Their-thing is a competitor to bitcoin.


They don't want this

Actually this looks more like bitcoin company leveraging banks.
Barclays is providing service to Circle to store their customer fiat funds. This is not the first such case of a Euro bank doing so (Fidor Bank). Barclays also appears to be doing fiat currency conversion for those same funds. This may be a first (if Bitreserve/Uphold doesn't count)
@_date: 2016-04-07 02:01:50
It's competing as a modern settlement/ledger solution for banks. The only true competitor to bitcoin in every sense for them to make would be an altcoin, and that's clearly irrelevant.

To farm downvotes, I wanted to point out that Barclays is ~~part~~ one of the founding members of the R3 consortium (the private blockchain group) and the quotes about banks turning towards the btc blockchain are entirely from Allaire who is with Circle.

Yet to see otherwise, but these have indefinite maturity date, and redemption is only in form of fiat (SEK). There is no way to get your hands on actual BTC. Also, all redemption appears to be categorized as  early (since it's before eternity) and at such comes at an extra 4.5% fee, and can only happen twice a year around spring and autumn.

Number you're probably going to be more interested in is "TOTAL ASSETS (M SEK)", which [bloomberg]( reported  closing last friday at 8.407M SEK, or roughly 4.3K BTC. These are the actual BTC shares created, which supposedly KnC will buy/reserve off the market. I suppose the next update will happen after OMX market close in about an hour or so.
Unless that number goes up, any volume is just the same old shares trading back and forth.
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:08:01
Somewhat. Consider different market effects:
a) KnC reserves coins it mines, passes over to XBT:
* Essentially an indefinite futures contract for their mining proceeds, with bonus that they they get paid 2.5% a year. 
* Spot exchange rate: no immediate change. 
* OTC market: reduced quantity from their mining sales.
* Works better in a bear market, as they hedge against downward price movements, and have fewer BTC overall to sell.
b) XBT takes fiat straight to exchanges, buys BTC:
* Effectively a direct price pump.
* Spot exchange rate: increases directly from buying.
* OTC market: same sell quantity from mining, but at likely higher price as spot price has moved upward.
* Works well in a bull market, as having more BTC is not a problem. Probably most profitable for them, if the amount mined and sold OTC is greater than the amount of XBT-buy BTC. Given current count of 4K or so BTC worth of shares, that seems likely the case.

2) Coins mined from KnC

@_date: 2015-06-19 08:02:51
Sure, but this is just a variation or at best a shortcut, not a replacement on the existing system.
Consider the similarity to what you're describing to the following: 
1) Scan/type in the manufacturer URL on the bottle to your wallet app, e.g. 
2) Website comes up with quantity selection, color, size, price total, etc. 
3) Your browser/wallet app auto-completes the details for your shipping info, email, and so forth. 
4) Checkout/pay button at bottom of the webpage prompts your wallet app to confirm price, then it sends off the payment.
Aside from a step or two of automation, this is exactly what shopping carts do today. Compared to what you described, only different really is the order of doing things.
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:59:18
Voluntary by nature of ETN, generally it'd be the interest of an issuer to hold equal funds to hedge their risk. XBT says its their policy to do so, but there is no contractual or regulatory obligation or necessity, unlike an ETF.

@_date: 2015-06-19 06:32:14
Sure, unique payment address associated to "you". Problem is, all the information of "you" is literally the function of a shopping cart, and an online shopping system. So while the fundamental idea of unique payment address isn't a bad idea, and in fact exists in one form or another, the 'problem' of manufacturers having to rely on retailers is overly simplified to be solved with just this. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:48:36
Where was this discussion? 
Seems to defy the point of it all if the colored coins can only be traded via their system, end recipients can't control their private keys to trade the coins thereafter to anyone else. If so, it's just an overly and unnecessarily complex way to publish history of trades that they still control.

BIP 70: 
The messaging is offchain and requires a HTTPS server on the seller end. There is an arbitrary "memo" field in the Payments message which the buyer could stuff their payment info I suppose. Problem is, there is no validation or formalization for this data, which btw, is sent from the client after the *actual* bitcoin tx goes through. So consider something where the seller doesn't ship to a particular P.O. BOX that the user specifies, then what? 
If you're proposing an BIP extension to this, this type of data interaction has to be formalized and standardized, but given the incredible variety of different scenarios and interactions with the data, that seems a daunting and unnecessary task. 
In the end, this still doesn't replace the need for a shopping cart system for the seller, just the visual appearance of it.

It's not so much no government regulations (that's a completely unrealistic expectation), as much as this being an *additional* layer of regulation where arguably existing regulations may have sufficed. That's why, while I respect Lawsky's openness and effort into all this, I'm not super enthusiastic about all of it especially given how slow regulations happen (and that critical "sometime afterwards" indeterminate time frame). 
Reading back now on the announcement earlier this year:


I could swear that during the hearings, they generally established that existing AML measures at the fiat entrance/exit gateways were sufficient.  So they want to add more then? I'm all for cyber-security and consumer protection, but I feel like those are huge mires that the NYDFS doesn't have the means or expertise to properly address. As an example, even PCI DSS isn't federally mandated.
Would be nice to have some sort of insurance or liability requirement though, so another Goxxing won't happen. 
Edit: Speaking of PCI DSS, that's an industry regulated standard. Maybe someone should start one for Crypto huh?

There was this 2 weeks ago: 
Obviously there is cost associated with this, but minuscule compared to buying/creating hash power to compete with rest of network.
Weird there was more discussion about this in the thread than the one, as far as the actual feasibility of this.
Reading the Bitcoin wiki about [anti-ddos measures]( there are plenty of measures against unusual transactions: orphans, malformed, doublespends, no-fee, burdensome scripts.
But with legit-formed min-fee tx's, those numbers sound about right @ $14K a day to massive deny service to the rest of "legit" txs. It'd cost far less than $14k/mo for enough a bunch of AWS instances and IPs or proxies to avoid any obvious IP bans.
Of course, people who want to get txs to go through can just increase their fees. Say double it, now it costs $28K/day, quadriple it, $56K/day. It gets hard to sustain indeed for long periods of time.
But grinding the network to a effective halt for just a few days would be a devastating attack. There's the turnaround for people to figure out to increase their fees (or changes to clients and system that do min for now), deal with the backlog of txs that piled up during the attack, the problem for legit microTXs to get through thereafter without impractical min fees, businesses that are brought to a standstill...
Maybe I missed an obvious solution, but it seems to be very much a potential problem from not even a state-level actor. 
Edit: OK, solution seems to be hardfork the 1MB/block limit immediately after first attack (?)

@_date: 2014-06-06 23:10:16
The context of the thread is the rise after the decline in price, my problem is with the top commentor suggesting entirety of negative impact of the Goxxing just that single lie, we clever bitcoiners saw the truth and now we're all back on our feet, no problem:


As for your response, I absolutely agree that Mark was lying through his teeth in his PDF, but that's hardly some sort of ongoing clever and blinding misinformation propaganda against bitcoin for the last 3 months of decline after that announcement. "FUD" (insert wikipedia link), not "general negative sentiment". The price didn't stay in a slump until May because of "FUD" that kept people believing **3 months later** that a protocol problem still existed. In fact, I'd say that the panic over malleability took its effect on the markets and was over within a week or two. That devs had very quickly fixed the minor issue in the main client as well as every exchange wasn't some sort of clouded 'fact' that took 3 months for traders to realize.
IMO Gox's part in the slump was those things I mentioned before--loss of lots of investment capital and harsh reality of trust regarding hosted bitcoin services--so the suggestion that getting past one of Mark's lies was the main problem holding us back, that it was all just FUD that we've resolved, again seems worryingly dismissive of those issues that still exist.

Manual / human brokered trades that might complete in the span of a day. Even if you're not a day trader that feels kinda unimpressive given the swings that happen in the timeframe, not to mention the likely huge spreads and broker fees. People who have wanted to sell large volumes have been able to (to Second Market before now), and buyers such as the Overstock CEO seem not to have had a problem moving millions of USD. Heck, you can move $50K/day on coinbase with 1% fee from Stamp spread already.

You're asking this question in so you're going to get several weak responses with counterexamples that people refuse to acknowledge (regarding pseudoanonymity, convenience) but 1 strongest reason: supporting the adoption of BTC.
As bitcoin exists currently for consumer shopping, there isn't huge advantages for the consumer. I've tried to point this out before, to realistically address the issue and try to  figure out actual innovations and killer apps that might actually spur demand from people who *aren't already invested into BTC* besides the novelty factor, and thusfar I haven't seen anything compelling. 
The fact is, the average consumer is lazy and selfish, looking out for what's most convenient and beneficial to themselves. You can go on about sticking it to big banks and companies, the nobility of a cause of supporting BTC adoption in its early stages, etc, but none of these reasons will drive an average consumer to specifically **obtain** and use BTC. For the average consumer, I would honestly compare it to a very-hard-to-obtain gift card at its current stage. Sure, you can redeem it for stuff at TD, heck if you find a giftcard (Gyft) you can use it at plenty of other places. You can transfer it instantly to other people (if you have a giftcard code) but why bother when you have something that already works?

Nothing I said has anything to do with supporting the state. I'm pointing out a potential weakness the state can exploit. I find it surprising that you find it hard to believe (technical reasons aside) that a state could NOT coerce a pool operator to do anything. I mean surely with all the fun things going on with the NSA and whatnot, there's reason to be wary of the possibility. I mean, you have the state weasling its way into the core infrastructure of communication across the entire nation here, public and private, why is not imaginable they can exercise some control on a few more individuals, with or against their will?
As far as the technical reason why a compromised pool operator is not a problem, I would genuinely like to know the limitations they have. Is there really no way to maliciously wreak havoc in any of the aforementioned ways in with that access? Hypothetically, if you could take control of both pools as operator, could you not do anything that would severely damage the trust of the Bitcoin network?

In all seriousness though to anyone butthurt about criticism of their favorite clever slang for a μBTC, you can call it whatever the hell you want *as slang*, just like we have "grand" "bucks" "benjamins" or whatever for USD. Who knows, maybe "bits", despite the terrible degree of arbitrary value and conflict with actual computer bits, catches on colloquially. 
But if you are Coinbase, trying to make yourself look like an actual financial service, listing **currency** with ambiguous units that sorta look like a ISO currency code, has no obvious relation to the established "BTC", that is just stupid.

Yes, the feature of taking bitcoin overrides every other virtue or inadequacy of a business. You know, like TigerDirect and their [1.6 merchant rating due to poor customer service]( After all, that's how free market should work, right? 
Is it out of the question to make a post explaining what the D actually offers...I don't know, what do people actually care about in a casino/hotel? Quality rooms, location, great food, great service, or excellent rates? Yeah so if any of those actually applied (never been there, dunno), then maybe check it out if you're in Vegas. 
I have nothing against, say, paying a little bit more or a little of my way to support a business who dares venture out with something as new and innovative as Bitcoin, but only if they would deserve my business otherwise. 
Otherwise, you get companies riding the PR fad of accepting BTC (or really, taking Bitpay/Coinbase) and straight out exploiting the nearly blind-religious-zealotry of some bitcoin supporters.

The point is, the fundamentals here aren't shifting in a positive light for the price on BTSP. Gox price shooting up (and jeezus, it's going to shoot up a lot) at the opening the tap to withdrawals, no matter how low the rate of flow, can only mean negative things for the price at BTSP in the mid and long term.
Thinking only about the 10K BTC &lt;= $600 on Gox is a bit short sighted, ignoring all the accumulation that has occurred and will occur on BTSP by following a Gox runup, as well as the 42K BTC in asks on Gox's orderbook that surely won't stay any longer than they can on that exchange. There is gonna be a lot of longs on BTSP that are going to face reality that there is a ceiling of constant sell pressure.
To put this another way, take a look at these two charts:
[Bid/Ask Depth BTSP](
[Bid/Ask Depth MtGox](
A little harder to tell toward end of that, but you're looking at only a peak of 20-something thousand BTC in asks on BTSP through all time. Gox is now sitting at 40K+ BTC on books.  The biggest factor is that the people escaping Gox to trade elsewhere can ONLY do so in form of BTC. If it were BTC **and** fiat migrating out of gox to BTSP, then sure things would balance out. Instead, BTSP and BTCE are going to have a over-supply of BTC with same supply of fiat, and its gonna get ugly not too long after it all kicks off.

To be fair, that arbitration is what part of what you pay for with Paypal/VISA/MC/AMEX fees. I buy electronics with my AMEX or MasterCard thanks to their ridiculous benefits if something breaks or even gets lost. That's why some people are happy to buy things on Paypal, since they rule at times absurdly in favor of the buyer.
Sure, you can do multisig, escrow, whatever really awesome features with bitcoin, but nothing helps you after the purchase is complete (e.g. PC build works ok for 5 days, breaks down, company refuses to fix). 
And if bitpay handles disputes/arbitration, that is an insane can of worms for them to open, and surely will increase their fees.

Why buy it at chinese retail costs, when you can just make your own?
The more relevant numbers are the 2.4 billion Yuan/US$390 million^\[[1]( of that supercomputer (which OP works out, is capable of output 10THash of SHA256), vs the cost of manufacturing your own mining rigs. 
For $390 million I'm pretty sure an entity can build out and exceed the power of the bitcoin network  [some multiple] over.
Edit: isn't there some website that estimates "cost to overpower bitcoin network" regularly?
Doing math based on current network at roughly 110,000 TH, with a single KnC Neptune that runs at 3TH and retails for $10K USD. That works out roughly $366M retail value of as many Neptunes as the current network hash rate. I find it hard to believe that a Neptune costs half of that to manufacture, nevermind efficiency of not having to build out individual units when all you want is raw hash power.

Seeing this posted over and over in context of Gox, and I'm somewhat amused that the distinction isn't made clear that this advice is for people looking for secure holding solutions for their bitcoins. 
If you don't put [some/any] of your coins on exchange, how do you plan on actually **trading**. Not everyone stores their titanium-etched wallets in a nuclear bunker, some folks actually trade crypto for fun, profit (or masochistic pleasure). By very nature of how an exchange works, you *have* to relinquish control of your funds. Feel free to make a misguided post (saw one a few hours ago) explaining how that isn't necessary.
That's not to say the writing wasn't on the wall regarding Gox or that one shouldn't understand the risk of trusting another entity with ones funds, but it's a bit tiresome to hear the message preached over and over that only an idiot would give someone else their BTC.

Right, so M-of-N would typically be 2-of-3, involving Buyer, Seller, and Arbitrator. (You can do 2-of-2 but there is still risk of problems there from either party.)
From my reading of 2 of 3 though, the Escrow agent has to be involved on initial transaction setup. Besides that technical aspect, I would imagine that any abitration service would like to know what he or she is getting into as far as the details of the transaction before agreeing to be involved. (Unless I'm incorrect at understanding the process, would definitely like to read on how the third party can be designated without anyone knowing.)
So then, the payment processor has to basically provide the service by default, that every purchase is a multisig transaction. I would imagine that the seller will always want to complete the btc transaction, so they will pretty much sign off on default. Then it becomes situation somewhat like you say, where either the buyer signs on receipt in a normal situation, or the arbitrator has to be involved for an additional fee to complete it in case of a dispute. 
I see two issues with this, first being the willingness of the buyer to pay extra (flipping model from where consumers are used to seeing 0% fee, have purchase protection bonuses,  and heck, even get rewards). The second and possibly most significant, is the willingness of the consumer to bother signing off at all. I can imagine being lazy about having to pull up a wallet and sign off whenever I buy something online. Nevermind a situation of say, running a business, where I don't want to have to complete multisig txs for the hundreds of supply orders I get a month. It's a burden on the consumer again, that makes this a hard sell for a typical retail purchase.

Hm, I suppose as data, the base unit in satoshis since obviously it wouldn't be a decimal data type. Does the original code comments or other documentation refer to 1 satoshi as the base unit of "bitcoin"? Otherwise I would argue that the same way financial software that uses INTs for currency amounts, doesn't imply that the base unit is anything but what is established as 1.0 units of that currency... 1.0 Bitcoins in this case.
Likewise, doesn't weigh much in argument against random non-SI units everywhere between 1 satoshi and 1 BTC.

Right, this would be an actual advantage of a decentralized peer-to-peer payment system: bypassing international bank and currency limitations. Highlighting this would be much more effective in conveying the game-changing nature of bitcoin. 
However, this is largely irrelevant to the "groundbreaking" angle of the article--the precise denomination and quick processing of digital payment systems over traditional cash between peers--which again are features of any of those centralized payment systems. It honestly feels like the thesis is presented from the perspective of some sort of borderline luddite discovering the existence of digital/mobile payment systems in 2014, trying to frame the context into a very familiar and domestic scenario of a split dinner tab but largely ignorant of the incredible boom in mobile payment systems in places like Asia that would find such a revelation amusingly behind the times by several years.

It's not just about a 51% attack, or double spending.
One of the pillars of BTC is its decentralization. From a security perspective though, if you wanted to destroy the integrity of the BTC network, you have only two points of failure.
I mean, the libertarian-minded folk here often talk about how the government can't control BTC, CAN'T STOP THE SIGNAL. But actually if push came to shove, all it'd take is tracking down and coercing the people running two largest pools.

I don't really see the huge problem of a double spend itself, even if it did happen. The time warp thing seems a bit more alarming, but I'm not sure how permanent that problem is either.
I'm thinking more of the impact on adoption and investment. 
People are throwing money at BTC because they see it as an exciting, next-generation of money store and transmission, secured by the strength of its network.
Are these VCs, investors, even merchants going to be confident in Bitcoin if an actual attack did occur, if a theoretical vulnerability was actually manifested? 
I mean, your points are perfectly valid that hackers using the internet isn't a problem, that Silk Road closing doesn't disprove BTC security. But this would be more like some flavor of SSL, which is supposed to be secure communication, is being vulnerable to  attack on a protocol level. All of a sudden, governments, banks, financial institutions, whatever, would not want to keep using it. By that example, could it be fixed? Sure, but the hit the reputation and trust in SSL would take would be disastrous.

I think a fair comparison needs to be made of how this works in bitcoin vs PayPal. The $20 OP got reamed for, is passed on from the Credit Card processor. If they didn't take Visa and so forth, that wouldn't be there (or at least they wouldn't be able to justify reaming you as much). 
Escrow services aren't free; in BTCrow for example is 1.55% fee. Since they work entirely on top of the bitcoin protocol and don't have to actually handle any money, their infrastructure requirements are minimal compared to a normal fiat escrow service, which from what I've seen charge around 3%.
For a retail situation, it's going to be a huge leap of the imagination for merchants of any real volume to adopt an escrow-per-transaction model. They aren't going to do it, both for the financial cost on top of payment processing (so 1.55% + 1% coinbase or whatever), and the fact they are used to and will expect payment in hand before shipment. 
Multisig escrow services will work fine for private transactions (person to person sales and whatnot), but it's not going to be a realistic replacement for the type of customer protection most are used to with credit cards or even paypal for most of their purchases.

Lest anyone think otherwise, doing bitcoin stuff that's meant to be *secure* (e.g. working with wallet / generating key) inside a VM is not a degree of security vs running Tails or somesuch. 
The only point using of a nonpersistent VM image is that over time, you don't get random malware carried over when you do potentially *insecure* stuff inside the VM, such as trying out a new web wallet or software.

Am I the only one who has 1-off virtual credit card numbers as a feature with my credit card company? These numbers are limited to only the first merchant that charges it, up to a limit I set, and expires when I want it to. It takes me likewise about 30s to generate a number and copy paste it into a checkout screen.
If someone hacks Amazon, where I keep a longer-term $1000-or so limit virtual card # saved, no big deal. They can't use the # anywhere else. 
If I really want to buy something from some tiny online retailer with perhaps not as big reputation as Newegg or something, no big deal either because I get full consumer protection if they try to screw me. If their security systems are made of Swiss cheese and again someone steals that  no one can reuse it elsewhere. If I used bitcoin instead in the same scenario, personal data such as my delivery address would get lost all the same. 
I look through all my transactions monthly not just because I have to make sure nothing anomalous exists on my physical-swipe cards, but because I actually pay attention to my spending and budgeting.
And yeah, I do buy stuff with bitcoin, but thusfar mainly things for which I don't care about consumer protection, such as delivery food and web services (e.g. my VPNs). 
I agree with several posters in this thread, that brick-and-mortar POS is the difficult but best potential advantage if implemented smoothly for bitcoin. I can't generate virtual credit numbers for that, after all.

Apple Pay's API seems to just allow other apps to pull the stored credit card (or rather, generated single-use card  for use.
It doesn't seem to have anything particularly special to be leveraged for  crypto, unless someone like Xapo partners up and has enough presence to do the virtual credit card thing. Even then it's just still all abstractions on credit-cards, there's nothing really that is actually bitcoin that Apple Pay is touching.
Maybe overall, not surprised given how hard it seems that Apple cozy'd up to the major payment processors (Visa, MC, etc) for their super discounts.

But even [Amazon]( isn't perfect. Newegg has a 9.42/10 but there's 700+ people there who have had some 1-star experience with them.
I'm glad that OP has had such a wonderful experience with every company he has ever interacted with, but its those 1/100 occasions that a chargeback/dispute becomes necessary that you really appreciate having some recourse. 
Particularly since Credit chargeback is a viable solution far AFTER any likely escrow service with bitcoin would have already concluded. 
Simple example: I buy a widget from online-retailer. We do 3rd party escrow. I get the widget, item looks ok from shipping, flip switch and light turns on, sign off on the BTC. 48 hours later while charging, widget explodes, and I look inside the cracked, charred casing and see the inside was packed with random junk parts and peanut butter. Online-Retailer says tough shit, it's probably your fault.
Credit card? Problem solved after I take a picture and dispute it. Non-reversible transaction? Nothing I can do if online-retailer refuses to play ball.

An electronic form of currency is obviously easier to divide than rigidly denominated physical cash, but I'm puzzled why Paypal is discounted in this article because it requires an email address (not altogether a strange or difficult thing to get, and frankly I think would be faster to communicate to a group than scanning a QR code one-by-one). There is no fee for nonmerchant payments and it's actually pretty easy to use the app to send someone money. Dwolla fee is something like $0.25, and Venmo is free. These mobile peer-to-peer payment systems let you solve the same problem: specify down to the penny of how much to one-time pay a friend or acquaintance, at essentially instant confirmation.
It's not to say that bitcoin is inferior to any of these other systems, but declaring victory over them all for weak reasons seems more of a disservice to bitcoin's actual advantages.

How much savings do you think they can pass on? Large retailers' volume surely gives them 2% or lower CC fees. 
So what happens, they give 2% discount for people paying with Bitcoin, effectively equaling out in the end on their profit margin? What's the incentive for them then?
Maybe split it halfways, so its 1% discount vs 1% profit? As a consumer, I don't know if 1% is enough to motivate me; I get more than that on avg with my credit cards, w/ all my credit card benefits.

How do you figure? As I mentioned, these would be legit-formed TXs, indistinguishable really from any other real TX. The result after the initial attack is that the min-fee gets jacked up (say 4x) to compete with the pocketbook of the attacker. Say, $0.06 as starting point then suddenly everyone has to adjust to roughly $0.24. Maybe that even  happens dynamically as a function of network monitoring that establishes a competitive fee rate based on traffic conditions.
OK, that's not too bad I suppose, it still costs more to send [huge fiat amount] from [countryA] to [countryB] using traditional methods. On the other hand, now it costs 5% to send anything less than $5, not remotely practical for the ideal "average joe walks into coffee shop and pays with bitcoin" scenario. Commerce once again trickles to a slow grind. 
Maybe the attacker, going for gusto on a Monday morning at 9AM when businesses start up, goes for 8x for half a day (still &lt; $56k in fee costs assuming same tx's per block). At this point, Bitcoin no longer becomes a viable transaction medium for businesses and institutions.
In a way, this denial of service attack is an accelerated simulation what happens if Bitcoin becomes a victim of its own success.

There's this mention, which honestly isn't super impressive in its heading (bold emphasis mine):


















Looking at the actual API description:
Stephen Colebourne/jodastephen on the JSR expert team maintains [joda]( bunch of java libraries and has this in his existing joda-money, which describes the class CurrencyUnit  


and now in the JSR as similar CurrencyUnit class description (API Docs\javax\money\CurrencyUnit.html in the zip):


This mention seems to be focused as defining a currency (in code terms, not in terms of economics...), as far its ISO code and decimals.
From looking at the [issues on Github]( and elsewhere, people trying to use his library for bitcoin and litecoin have had to add it as custom units since they aren't official ISO currency codes.
I presume that the biggest takeaway from all this is that this java dev understands the likely future addition of bitcoin's BTC (or any crypto or virtual currencies I suppose) as an official currency code according to the ISO 4217 standards, and that possibly the coders with the financial entities agree with this.
On the other hand, I think it's quite a bit over-stating that "Credit Suisse is submitting a new java API spec to deal with Bitcoin" as OP so grandly claims.

Let's run numbers for a phone. 
* From the previously released article from coindesk on 21's chip fab results, their most efficient miner was a [0.22 w/GH 22nm chip](  For incredibly amusing argument's sake let's pretend this chip can somehow fit inside a smartphone along with everything else, is 100% efficient, and does not suffer debilitating heat dissipation issues.
* A large smart phone battery packs something like [3000mAh, 11Wh]( The entire battery drain of aforementioned large smart phone would yield at current difficulty, [0.00002147 BTC]( This is half a penny at current exchange rate. 
OK, battery-run mining is shit. Alternatively, we can run numbers the phone is only mining when it's plugged in.  
* Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 passes up to 3A @ 12V or 36W, far greater than typical chargers which do [1A @ 5V = 5W]( Running off charger power alone for 12 hours a day (plug it in when you get home from work / overnight), the phone will mine [0.00084302 BTC a day]( This is about 20 cents, with electricity costs at 5 cents.
* 21's mining model is [25%-75% split]( Running off a complete battery charge yields 1/8th of a penny of income for your smartphone (worthless), whereas a 12-hour on-charger mining stretch yields 5 cents for your smart phone ...at the cost of 5 cents of electricity. 
* Seeing as how the amount of coins mined is utterly insignificant, how does it amount to any meaningful sum worth using or billing for? 5 cents a day * 30 days is $1.50 of microtx'd calls or cellular data a month. What is that, 30 minutes of calls, 10MB of data? T-mobile charges [$3/mo for 30 minutes of calls alone](
* Accordingly, how do these insignificantly amounts come close to recovering cost of subsidizing these devices? If $1.50 is mining revenue a month for end user, then 21 receives $4.50. Let's say it costs $50 to manufacture one of these "cheap" phones that have Qualcomm quick charge and one of the fancy mining chips inside. It'll cost damn near a year of faithful charge-mining to break even alone on that cost. Nevermind what happens within a year to mining difficulty.
None of this is anything remotely sensible to a business model. 
Maybe we should move onto the numbers for 24/7 appliances to turn into electricity hogs.

This is exactly what colored coins allows one to circumvent, by allowing the smallest amount of bitcoin needed to construct a transaction, to transmit data regarding a completely arbitrary amount of value and quantity of another asset. This is precisely the reason why this NASDAQ experiment is going on.


In case of equities, these colored coins are *representations* of real-world assets. The only way any of it means anything is if there is a trusted, authoritative entity which takes real-world assets, issues legally binding coins as representations, and facilitates the redemption of those assets by the coin holders. If the trusted entity fails to deliver, then legal action is exactly the proper recourse.

Sure, you can't send money from one of those services to the other. But you *can* receive Venmo money, move it to Paypal, and vice versa (yes, after much delay inherent with fiat transfers). In the end, $100 is still $100 no matter what because no conversions take place. 
If Circle is marketing this product as "sending USD" to *anyone* as a better feature over PayPal/venmo, but it's not the same result as sending it via internal ledger due to inevitable inconsistencies of conversion rates, then a lot of folks are going to be turned off by that failed delivery of expectations.

Only way refunds work is if seller funds are held for an arbitrary length of time in Paypal's control, the same way that bullshit happens now.
Again, it's not your bitcoins. Even better, consider what happens if for same absolutely amazing reason Paypal opts to keep payments in bitcoin instead of instant conversion to fiat. Bitpay/coinbase instant conversion removes merchant exposure to volatility, what happens if the price drops 30% in the month that paypal holds back your BTC?
@_date: 2015-05-13 02:06:36
Absolutely, there's validation. But I see Wallstreet hopping aboard this digital asset/colored coin bandwagon as perceived validation for the system of colored coins, for Bitcoin to be like a tool or protocol, but not so much as validation of Bitcoin units themselves as a currency or store of value--something that is necessary for the whole bitcoin-takes-over-world-economy type of scenario.

I'm not following this at all, this sounds backwards. The only sensible correlation that has been made as far as increases in mining power (and subsequently security) is drastic increases in price. Not surprisingly, people want to get in on that to get rich, or others spin up previously un-sustainable hashing power that was turned off. 
Until such time that mining fees become substantially greater than blockrewards--where great increases of actual  transaction vol directly correlates to increase income from fees--I don't see the flow of events happening the way you describe.
Edit: Likewise, I don't think the previous post was overcomplicating the issue. You can't tell me that utterly undermining the factor of scarcity of bitcoin in regards to value transfer/storage is not a straightforward and significant effect.

Sure, thats why you have standardized units when dealing with convenient orders of magnitude.

Well, by that argument, you fund your Paypal with $10 and send a buddy some of that, and since it worked instantly, that's as great investment as Bitcoin.
To be perfectly frank, sending and receiving bitcoin from one person to another looks ostensibly about as new and innovating as email or instant messages. Of course, it's supposed to look that familiar and simple, but it's the underlying protocol and blockchain that allows it happen and keeps it secure that makes it different and far more significant. Without understanding that part, you can't and won't get why Bitcoin is gamechanging.

I'm more wary of how this taints the 'average joe' view of bitcoin when it's marketed as something that Paypal provides.

From a marketing perspective, what's the incentive for the average Joe to go out and obtain bitcoin to pay his or her DISH bill?
There's no element of anonymity, and DISH (last I checked) required a 2-year contract with early termination fees, so the whole thing is built on a re-occuring pull payment model.
DISH would have to offer something of a discount on the monthly rate. Say this saves them 2% on CC processing fees and they pass it on to the consumer. Nevermind the overhead for purchasing BTC, that's less than $2 savings (at the highest non-promo rate of $80 or so a month).

Your point is that it's yet another database that could be potentially stolen, and the risk to consumers is having credit card numbers compromised. 
Again, fraud is literally last thing that I'd be worried about out of all that, especially since the chance is nonexistent for me and how I use my cards to travel.

Exchange.Coinbase launched on January 26, 2015.
First day volume was just shy of 200BTC, second day 1.6K, third day 5K. 
At present, with 5-10K BTC volume on daily basis, it is on the scale of about 2% of global exchange volume.
It is indeed, two completely different capital markets. $GBTC is currently the completely irrelevant one.

That convergence certainly shouldn't have an effect on spot price, but then again panic and euphoria have been inspired by lesser events.

It'd be impossible for anything but the smallest sub-unit of any currency to be used as 1 "unit" in code, since it's always going to be expressed as an int64 data type, not a decimal float. There's comments such as following in /src/coins.h:


I refer to my comment about financial code w/ other currencies, the accepted base unit of USD is still $1.0 USD even if it's expressed as an int64 of of $0.00[...]1 units. Accordingly, I argue that base accepted unit of BTC is still 1.0 BTC. 
This is probably nothing but pedantry at this point, but even if SATs were the real unit of bitcoin, a 100-SAT denomination that is slang at best, has no place being used as a financial unit of accounting. Then displaying as KSAT? MSAT? Sure if you want, that's the point of standardized units.

This has been particularly confusing for folks, so how to estimate volume from the OMX website:
Take number **Turnover** column from top of page. Divide by **Last** number next to it. Divide again by 200.
E.g. 
Last | Turnover
9.69 | 269,111
269,111 / 9.69 / 200 = ~138.86 BTC equiv of shares
Actual volume will vary by price change, but that's a close enough estimate anyhow based on the OMX website. I have no idea why they don't show actual share vol (wtf?).
@_date: 2015-05-09 16:36:50
Friday's volume was indeed an improvement, nearly exceeding Exchange.Coinbase's Day 2 vol. This does not change the reality that $GTBC is still an illiquid, inefficiently arbitraged fund on the pink sheets. The mere fact that something exists in the realm of equities market does not somehow mean that it, or any listed shit penny stock, is suddenly destined for greatness. And certainly while I made that first post, and even now after yesterday, GBTC's relevance is minuscule in context of global bitcoin trading.
I find it a bit amusing, looking actual trades that happened all day Friday, it's about 11:1 ratio of sell pressure vs buy pressure. This is shaping up to look like  long-awaited exit for some BIT weary holders. I expect vol to ramp up a bit more even next week as others follow suit.

The point of a Trezor is that the priv key storage and signing is on a secure device separate from a potentially compromised computer or smart phone. This is **not the same** as an extra layer of encryption for storing a BIP38 wallet file. 


If you don't buy a trezor or other hardware device, you need to go through a LOT more effort to secure your android or iOS device you so casually sweep your BIP38 private key into.

How does this happen? The only way bitcoin 'price' or fiat exchange rate goes up, is if people buy bitcoin. 
OK, but *why* do people want to buy bitcoin? 1 BTC is 100 million satoshis, which individually could each be a colored coin representing any arbitrary amount of a digital asset (not limited just 1 satoshi = 1 stock, 1 satoshi is enough to hold the data saying "This is equal to 1000 shares of GOOG for example.)
Fees and TPS limits aside, the entirety of the global stock market trade activity in a day can be taken care of by a single BTC (far fewer than 100 million trades).
So why does anyone *else* want, or even *need* to buy any measurable quantity of BTC?

Subsidized phones imply cost is ultimately made up by 21's profit share of mined coins. 
Thusfar, by no calculations and even by partial admittance in 21's own statement, will mining be profitable for the user in terms of electricity costs.
In poorer corners of the world, electricity costs far more due difference in infrastructure. 
As such, I don't see how "cheap phones" wouldn't end up ultimately *exploiting the poor*.
@_date: 2015-05-01 00:44:35
Again, it doesn't matter which price is higher or lower. Better is subjective depending which side of the equation is on. If I were buying coins right now, I would get rates: 
* $237.92 with "no fees" from Circle
* $235.46 + 0.2% (taker fee) = $235.93 from Bitfinex
* $235.79 + 0.25% (taker fee) = $236.37 from Coinbase Exchange. 
Of course, Coinbase retail is the most expensive after applying its 1% fee, won't bother mentioning that.
There will always be variance of 'true' spot price given the internationally distributed nature of current major exchanges, regardless of how much liquidity enters the market to create tight spreads. Unless both Circle and the non-Circle receiving party's processor clear and hedge their coins at the same source and using mechanism perfectly designed to offset each other (unlikely), the resulting USD received will **always** be inconsistent.
I repeat, this is perfectly normal when dealing with BTC, but when they try to disguise it as "sending USD" and discrepancies inevitably occur, that's a major user-experience problem.
@_date: 2015-05-01 12:47:05
The prices track well enough that the fraction of 1% is not worth the effort IMO. Of course you could potentially automate this with great efficiency, but I can't help but feel that the lack of liquidity as well as legal annoyances after you move large quantities coin/fiat, make this less than appealing. That and the only platform you can make any hedges against price movement during 3-confirmation transit is BFX.

Yes, that's the obvious conclusion. In context of Internet of Things, satoshis are used in such trivial monetary amounts that the economics are confusing at best, so perhaps instead acting largely as data tokens for functions such as authentication.

No, upon redemption or maturity of these 'paper btc', the issuer pays the BTCUSD price change in terms of fiat. 
For instance, you buy 1 BTC worth of certificates today at say $250, BTC goes up in price to $500 next year, you redeem your certificates for $500 minus fees (around $485). It's also in Swedish krona, so USDSEK exchange rate differences also apply.

The damning part about the willy connectivity is that some of it was explained away by what Mark called "Private API connections" that supposedly one could purchase. Someone on IRC may have the logs, but the exact context this came up was during one of the API downtimes due to DDOS in ~April 2013, and *someone* kept on trading.
When asked about how that was possible, Mark said on IRC you could buy a private API connection that gave you dedicated trade access when the public API was down. To date, I haven't heard of anyone actually being able to buy one of these private API connections (feel free to chime in, anyone), so if that was a lie, then as far back as then Mark knew about this, and it was certainly NOT some master hacker that was under the radar the whole time.

Well, if it's a Coinbase merchant yeah, you're getting charged 1% for them to move fiat internally through their system. Semi-anonymously-ish. Especially if the merchant has your shipping info anyhow. 
Newegg is actually partnered with Bitpay, so you're paying 1% for the security of payment, in so far as that you have no credit card number to compromise. If you are paying for some digital service (such as a VPN, porn, whatever), then you can possibly retain a decent degree of anonymity. Likewise for p2p transactions. 
But yes, for the average consumer making generic purchases, I'm not seeing this as a strong sell, especially given the 1% fee instead of 1-3% credit card rewards + chargeback support. Over hodling BTC to make purchases and possibly losing more than 2-4% in price volatility though, it's a big improvement.
@_date: 2015-05-13 01:17:47
And there's the trick.
If you can make fractions of pennies worth of colored coins for billion-dollar equivalents of equities, which ultimately requires trust in some third-party for issuance and redemption, why not also make colored coins for other things, such as trading funds? That's what I fully expect in a case where actual trading w/ these coins occurs.
@_date: 2015-01-21 04:27:41
I think there's a somewhat unfortunate lack of realization that a huge portion of current speculators in the BTC space can make money when the price goes up **and down**. 
Back in the day when Gox was the most significant trading volume, or even when China started taking over that  volume spot globally, profit only happened one way for people pouring in fiat to the market: you buy, price goes to moon, then you sell. A buy-and-hodl from $100 to $1000 was a 10x USD return during that bubble. 
(Yes, BTCE and BFX had margin trading and shorting, MPEx had options, and so forth but their volumes were still a tiny piece of the pie, and most traders coming into the BTC space weren't turning to these).
Where are we now though? Margin trading is the vast majority of volume, on exchanges such as BFX Huobi, BTCN, OKCoin. Bitstamp and LakeBTC hold about 7% market share between then. The explosion in the chinese futures markets with 50:1 leverage means the price can go up or down a few bucks and you're looking at 100% profit in a few  minutes or hours. No parabolic bubble needed. 
For those with deep enough pockets to actually manipulate the price (read: move the market enough on their own to spur emotions from longs or short), I suppose the question currently is, which side is easier to move? While BFX may be at BTC swap highs, this is still only 25K out of how much BTC out there being hodled? 
Also, I wouldn't be surprised that people trading on on margin and in futures are probably loving the low prices, because a $20 swing here is a full 10% price move, vs at $50 swing at $500.

From what I've read, the US ACH system is a dated process at best: transactions are uploaded every day to a secure FTP server in some sort of flat file format then reconciled. Technologically that's barely a step above faxing a pile of papers every night, but supposedly the security should be sorta ok with SFTP, files are PGP encrypted by each bank, and so forth.
The obvious 'next step', is just to have secure data lines sending this kind of data in real-time to the central ledger.
What a central controlled, but distributed ledger/blockchain system might have over this would probably include infrastructure security/redundancy, and maintaining an irrefutable history of transactions. Whereas (potentially) there can be a hacked central ledger...the equivalent of an excel sheet being edited...balances cant be arbitrarily altered on blockchain without completely rewriting history with each transaction signed by each bank. Also, instead of maybe 1 central server, the central authority can have a few, so that if one goes down or gets hacked, there is still both consensus and availability of the ledger across all the banks.

So just to make this clear, we're not arguing about the viability of charging micropayments for gated content like reddit/NYTimes as a business model, or viability of bitcoin to facilitate those payments.
We're talking about sensibility of these 21 devices in an environment where presumably all that shit is already in place, works with bitcoin, and people have been convinced that kinda gated content thing is totally cool.
Say you go shopping for a USB charger for your phone. There's one from 21 (slide 5)  that promises to churn out 'internet viewing credits' at some limited rate a day. Some haters on reddit, you recall, have been bitching and moaning about how supposedly the thing costs you twice as much in energy costs as you get in internet credits and it'll only decrease in time. There's also another USB charger, plain, from Belkin or Samsung. It comes bundled with a $5 'internet viewing credit' topoff code, which incidentally is enough $0.0001 content page views for pretty much a whole year.

This chart: 
This serves as more of a sentiment indicator of how "much" longs or shorts have risked at any given point. 
It's generally sensible to quantify shorts in BTC as OP shows in his chart (showing 5K to 25K increase in latest decline from December), however, putting it in USD equivalent puts it on a somewhat comparable scale vs longs. That is to say, currently we have 15M USD that are (probably mostly) hodling long positions, whereas only roughly 5M USD with short positions. 
If you view margin trading in the grand scheme of things as a zero-sum game between longs vs shorts, making bets on the price up and down, winners taking gains from the losers, there is still more far more risked and to lose on the longs side.

The mental gymnastics to justify bitcoin generation as a resource is one thing, but even then the yield has severe limitations in practicality due to scale. Scale matters, a lot. There's a difference being able to generate millionths of a penny vs generating sufficient funds capable of micropurchasing something tangible to an end-user. 
Consider the example of gaming micropayments for example. You know, buy some bullshit energy stars on some mobile game or powerup potions for an MMO for $1, or maybe some DLC skins on steam for $2-3. I posit that these devices simply cannot fulfill that role.
Spewing out numbers with some generous assumptions I won't bother to link w/ sources this time:
For take an Oculus rift consumer model recently announced. It uses 2 USB 3.0 ports, which are rated for 4.5W each. 9W total. Assume heat dissipation is not an issue. Assume that you don't even use the damn thing to play games, you just leave it plugged in to your computer you leave running on 24/7, dedicated to mining. Insert 21's most efficient 0.22w/GH mining chip, which is twice as efficient as any commercial ASIC on market. After paying 75% mining pool fees, you get [$0.02/day]( 
Great. 2 cents. What scale of convenience is $0.02/day or (extrapolating) $0.72/month going to facilitate? That can pay for a relatively cheap DLC on steam, maybe. Second problem emerges: time for accumulation. Say I buy an Oculus rift today, I also buy Call of Duty 9: Prehistoric Warfare game with micropayments. Woohoo what fun. What's this, I can buy a stone club for 50 cents to better bash noobs heads in online! But wait, how do I pay for that with my Oculus rift's fundamental resource of bitcoin generation? I sit my ass down and wait for 3 and a half weeks. OK then.

The operative word *need* isn't entirely accurate. They do not need to buy coins first to issue notes.
They state that it is their policy and it is in their interest to hedge [upwards] price movements by purchasing BTC. But the design of this ETN certificate is such that all that matters is they pay the redemption amount in the end. If BTC starts plummeting, they *could* profit by choosing not to buy BTC and essentially enter a short position. Compare this to BIT or COIN where each share must be backed by BTC.
Also, *they* are KnC, a mining group. They don't need to buy btc as much as get some btc to hold. It is unknown how much BTC they will in practice reserve from mining, vs buying directly on exchange, or any other marketplace.

You've listed additional features of Bitgo as:
* IP restriction
* Time restriction
* BTC destination addr whitelists
* BTC amount/time restrictions
* 2FA on 3rd-of-n signing
In the case of a high volume exchange wallet, I find it hard to believe that Bitstamp would not have the withdrawal process automated, or actually require manual validation for every single withdrawal users want to make (that's just impractical unless its large amounts, which they already seem to require). 
So either requests to your API are automated somewhere, or requests even to a secondary hardened stamp machine acting as validation and 3rd-of-n signing are automated. As such, we still have that point of failure: whatever machine that decides based on Stamp's rules, that a withdrawal is valid.
Should that Bitstamp machine be compromised, then we're at security through obscurity, no? Hope that the attacker lacks knowledge of those arbitrary rules designated at Stamp's Bitgo account that raise flags or lockdown the account.
Since it's still unclear to the public what exactly went wrong at Stamp, then might this not be a little early to decide that the issue is completely resolved with Multisig?

The economics of how I see this might be wrong, so feel free to correct me if you'd like. The argument is, because X entity uses technology, the value of said technology should increase. Speculators, particularly those already on the markets, will see this as a bullish thing and fulfill that to some degree. But adding "colored" value vs actual value, I argue is a vastly different thing of scale.
I have some rough analogy of colored coins turning bitcoin into a commodity like paper from that of gold, but the gist of it is, that using colored coins completely undermines the factor of bitcoin's scarcity in regards to its value. Extremely generalized, gold is scarce, thus unit values of it (ounces, tonnes, whatever) can be stores and transfers of value. Storing value with paper, on the other hand, has little bearing on its scarcity as all you have to do is print a dollar amount on that piece of paper, or write a legal contract for example, that transfers value of a multi-billion dollar asset. The value of paper is not going to the moon.
I'm not entirely sure how the dynamics of fees will work, especially with systems like Factom's of hashing and transaction batching, but consider that the goal of the Nasdaq experiment and likely any other digital asset management system is to keep a extremely low bottom line for these transactions. I saw some statistic that there's something like 10 million individual trades on the NYSE a day. If these folks developed some system involving the blockchain, but use mere satoshis for each record, that's less than 1BTC a day  (ignoring how they figure out how to deal with fees).
The "value lying on the blockchain" might be substantial for NYSE, but completely meaningless to anyone else. In that scenario, no one is going to buy more bitcoins because they are so useful, when all you need to run an entire stock market is 1 BTC. No one is going to try to buy up all the paper supply because a few companies can write billion/trillion dollar contracts on just a few sheets.
Edit: Carrying on comparison to VISA network, if every merchant were a colored satoshi transaction, that's something like 2 BTC a day of satoshis to run entire visa network (again, conveniently ignoring how fees work for sake of this analogy)

I think this is 0.1w per Gh/s OP is quoting is stated in hypothetical realm. [This]( new mining chip publicized just 3 months ago claims to be ahead of everything else in industry at 0.33w/Gh. [21's alleged new chip]( is at 0.22w/Gh. Bear in mind these are the top of the line chips, which certainly do not comprise the entirety of the network. The top retail miner according to the bitcoin wiki is the [Antminer S5]( running at just over 0.5w/Gh/s. Taking generous estimate then, let's say avg is 0.3w per Gh/s
As you note, the article is inexplicably quoting a year-old hash rate from time it was written from end of 2013. 
Whereas [bitcoinwisdom]( estimates current network hash rate of 402,379,575Gh/s, or up by nearly multiple of 48. 
So if w per Gh/s is off by 3x, total hash rate off by 48x, then the current consumption is equal to about 144x the author's numbers, or 97,100 US homes.
Indeed, running actual numbers, apply current hash rate to 0.3 watts per Gh/s, we get 120MW or 1,051,200,000 kWh annual. 
Per some [usgov site](


Ends up 96,300 US homes, pretty close to 97,100 first estimate.
According to a [energy consumption estimate map of NYC]( The whole block the BofA tower is on consumes 99361 * 10^3 kWh annually. I found an [estimate]( that the Empire state building consumes 55 million kWh annually, so actually this is almost 2x that. 
That means bitcoin network power consumption is at least 10 times the whole block that the BofA tower is on. Which actually looking at a map, includes the NASDAQ market building ...

Read up on Augur's REP system, looks pretty interesting. There are some similarities to Ethereum's [Schelling Point]( concept, though that one is a bit more clearly and simply explained as far as its technical implementation. A few issues I notice:
* The nature of the data being polled by the oracle must be completely public and open to be weighed upon by the entire REP user base. For a prediction market, this is very much appropriate. For something else, say a business contract between two parties (e.g. deliver 100 widgets by next week for $1000) or anything involving any remotely sensitive information, this would likely not be. 


* What if financial incentive to lie/cheat is greater than that of the REP system rewards? For instance, I have a multibillion dollar smart contract for some sort of business deal. Things get sour. I publicly say screwit, anyone votes and show they have voted in my favor gets a $100K. Whereas the REP value system is funded by fees from the PM itself, oracle fees aren't going to pay anything close to that collusion reward.
* I have yet to fully read up on the technical implementation for Augur, but it ultimately, these are systems that exist outside of bitcoin and the blockchain. As such, they exist as potential areas of failure or attack. Namely, some entity must exist to control key(s) to release funds. Can this entity suffer no risk of being hacked? Can it not be MITM'd and fed false REP vote data? An ethereum contract exists on-chain and suffers slightly fewer problems, as the Schellingcoin example is described.

Seems that the smart-contracts-will-replace-lawyers-and-everything involves a lot of premature handwaving on how it will actually work. Bitcoin's scripting language is fairly limited, not even Turing complete as Ethereum. Granted, it's designed that way. If you cannot have an bitcoin-native way to create trustless transactions dynamics based on external states without ultimately relying on an oracle, then as you say, it ends up as another potential attack surface. Sure you can try to mitigate this by decentralizing oracles, some sort of game theory where you incentivize 'the truth' financially, but ultimately this all rests outside of bitcoin, and is not inherently a bitcoin solution.

I don't think your [pitchfork]( does much against his statement. He's dismissing using Bitcoin as tokens of value, because it's irrelevant for his use case. 
The basis of Singer's assertion that bitcoin will end world poverty, is that it facilitates property ownership by means of a decentralized public ledger. 


You can argue until you're blue in the face whether you can have 'secured, distributed consensus without a valued token'. I'd agree, you need a value token as incentive to keep such a network in its purest form. 
But Singer doesn't need to care about that, because for his use case of a property ownership ledger, *you do not need to use bitcoins as tokens of value*. All you need is a a minimal amount of actual bitcoins to write data to the blockchain, as evident by colored coins like [Coinprism assets]( or [Proof of Existence]( How *much* value these tokens has is not Singer's problem, as long as its value and (consequently) its network hashrate doesn't go to 0 like some shitcoin. You can say that bitcoin **has** to have a binary outcome, either $0 or take over world currency, but pretty much anywhere inbetween including where we are at now, is perfectly fine for Singer's idea.
The actual challenges of the world population in poverty actually recording, transferring, and acknowledging property on the blockchain, or if the science even supports the notion that property ownership is the main thing holding the world's population in poverty...  that's a separate discussion.

I wonder how much faster settlement from Bitpay/Coinbase occurs vs MC/Amex/Visa. I mean, the chokepoint is all in the processor-to-merchant bank deposit step, right? Is there some longer step that a credit card processor undertakes that relatively delays that bank transfer? I wouldn't mind hearing from some actual merchants.
But you again bring up reversibility and I point out there's no point to push that benefit **unless the merchant cuts out credit cards completely**, because the people who abuse chargebacks are going to keep doing so with credit cards anyhow. I mean, how do you wave that away in your pitch? "I know you guys see 1% chargeback a month, so once you add on bitpay/coinbase option, that'll all go away!"

Merchant transactions of course do incur fees, but those are straightforward and flat, such as Paypal's 2.9%. There is no seemingly random aspect to this. 
Domestic P2P payments from Paypal, Venmo have no fees. Venmo doesn't actually do international, I think. Circle allows wallets for international customers for bitcoin, but very limited if at all for fiat. As such, I think the 'privileged' zero-fee US market is an apt context to frame Circle's product in. Users likely aren't expecting exchange/conversion dynamics to apply.

* Receives no discount on processing over VISA/MC
* Receives no benefit regarding chargeback abuse--spoiler: people who chargeback **will use credit cards to do so anyhow**. Unless merchant shoots himself in the foot as of current state of adoption, and cut out credit cards entirely. 
* Takes in overhead of development to implement BTC payments, manhours of staff training.
* Probably better off just spending money on plain SEO/marketing instead.
Consumer: 
* Does not immediately see any visible discount. Price for $10 widget on Acme Corp's website still says $10. A BTC-rated 'discount' that appears later on payment processor end, is only apparent to those intimately familiar with spot exchange rates that very minute. 
Payment Processor:
* Has literally no sales pitch to compare to Bitpay/Coinbase and their free/1% processing fees.
@_date: 2015-04-30 06:59:21
A side effect of blurring the lines from BTC towards USD is the unavoidable small fluctuations and fees in the conversion process, especially when transmitting outside of the third party wallet. If you transfer $100USD from one Circle user to another, I would assume that's instant (centralized) and works perfectly as expected, just like PayPal. 
On the other hand, if I want to send "$100" to Bob outside of Circle, then interesting things will happen. Surely there's an exchange fee, either invisibly applied at the conversion rate or visibly after the fact. What about the receiver? By time it gets to Bob who is using Coinbase for example, then suddenly he's looking at $98USD possibly in hand.
With BTC, these small details are accepted as the norm, whereas with USD, people expect $100 to be $100. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 19:42:43
@_date: 2015-04-30 13:57:49
It's not about higher or low. It's about differences of price due to exchange rates; however it is Circle buys or sells its BTC, their price is slightly different from others. That's perfectly natural, yet an issue when using the service marketed as sending USD. If I were an average Joe user and tried to send you $100 right then, I would have purchased behind the scenes 0.42591251 BTC. If you had Coinbase, that would have arrived in your wallet (ignoring even possibility that price would have changed within 3 confirms) and visible to you as  $99.13. Only a few cents difference perhaps, but compared to the experience perhaps expected of Paypal or Venmo, it certainly leaves some questions. 
Therein lies the problem.

Have you actually tried doing this to another person?
We're not talking about merchant transactions which have a clear (starting) fee of 2.9% + $0.30. Circle does not have a payment processor service, nor would you use the "send ~~money~~ USD" function to pay for an outside sale transaction. 
Edit: Actually, even if there was a bridge from Circle to say, Paypal, the merchant still receives $99.13 **before** fees are applied at the Paypal end. Point still stands. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 01:53:20
You can be a bit more creative. Storage isn't limited to OP_RETURN and 40 (or 80 for that matter) bytes, it's more so that doing it any other way is unconventional at best. 
See the [bitcoin whitepaper]( encoded into a 194KB tx, using entire outputs as data.
Obviously you'd have to pay a bit in fees to get an image in there  and you'd be limited by blocksize.

You're absolutely right about the nature of smart property, and I'm not claiming those monumental challenges don't exist bridging a digital ledger into the real world. I'm simply pointing out this trend I'm seeing with these startups popping up recently, as well as folks like Singer. They are interested in leveraging the bitcoin blockchain ledger (or whatever dominant crypto emerges), while completely avoiding the units of value, and this is how they plan on doing it.
@_date: 2015-09-27 19:52:26
It's not doable natively in Bitrated. Way I've dealt with it as a seller is by hedging the same amount of BTC on one of the exchanges or derivative markets. 
Example (extra steps bolded): 
* Price of BTC is $250. I sell an iPhone for agreed $750 or 3 BTC. 
* Buyer deposits 3BTC into Bitrated multisig.
* **I short 3 BTC on Bitfinex.** 
* [Seasons change, time passes by](
* Buyer receives item and releases funds.
* I now have 3 BTC, and a 3 BTC short position. 
* I exchange the 3 BTC at Coinbase/Circle or wherever for USD
* **I close the 3 BTC short position on Bitfinex. I pay a tiny bit in fees to BFX, less than 0.5% total.**
If BTC price didn't change and is still $250, obviously nothing really happens. I don't make or lose anything on Bitfinex, and I get $750 from Coinbase/Circle.
If BTC price went up, then I lose a that % in my Bitfinex funds, but gain that % in my Coinbase/Circle sale.
If BTC price went down, then I gain that % in my Bitfinex funds, but lose that % in my Coinbase/Circle sale. 
Obviously, this requires you to hold funds in one of those markets or exchanges and adjust your funds in and out every so often. If one does enough business as a seller, this might be worthwhile.
Note that one could potentially hedge on 20x or something margin and 'risk' less exposure on the platform, but who knows when the next one of those random $100 spikes on BFX or OKCoin might be. There's the risk of liquidation and more likely than not, the market will bounce right back afterwards.

@_date: 2015-04-04 17:26:31
Right, I mentioned utterly worthless is no good, since by lack of incentives of token value, the network hashrate and security is also pretty shit by then and easily attacked. Then again, even for how near-worthless LTC is now, it's not entirely trivial to mount a 51% on that network.
My assumptions for such a use case is that it would simply latch onto the *predominant* cryptocurrency network, whatever that is, whatever the value is, and that'll be good enough. 
But as you're saying that you can be more specific, that the limit value of property you can designate through colored-coins (or whatever other OP_RETURN-like data storage) is a direct function of the cost of attacking the network, whichever network that is. That does sound somewhat sensible of a idea, but my counter is that no thief would bother mounting that 1 billion dollar 51% attack because there is little gain to show for it.
I'd guess that an attack of that scale would be more likely in the asset/property ownership and trade use case in a business like Blythe Masters and Digital Assets Holdings that was in headlines recently. They could have potentially multi-billion dollar asset transactions moving around a blockchain.  For sure, that would massively eclipse examples of the impoverished third-world population moving ownership of a cow or $500 vehicle. 
Only two things the thief can do after spending a billion on hashrate and gaining majority of the network is 1) exclude legit transactions and 2) double-spend transactions of their own. The thief can't simply start signing TXs putting arbitrary property into their name. 
In discussions about Master's Digital Asset Holdings, this was brought up before [here]( and [here]( and no one has proposed a scenario in which any sort of attack has any meaning when crossing the digital to real-world boundary.

The "TCPIP of money" sounds nice, but in implementation I'm not seeing how this is particularly groundbreaking beyond a UX abstraction layer on top of two parties running exchange accounts in current system. 
There are numerous challenges:
* Superwallet account holders are still required to perform AML registration on their exchange/gateway of choice. The same inconveniences and problems some users face with registering or buying/selling with Coinbase or Circle, for example, will carry over their respective Superwallets.
* These Superwallet gateways are ultimately just exchanges, which means that the dynamics of exchange volume, liquidity, regional availability still come into play. OKC or Bitfinex as a Superwallet would be great, but someone use a Cavirtex superwallet  would see much greater slippage off any transaction.
* By denominating in fiat, divergences between spot prices on different exchanges will result in exchange rate problems. Sometimes it might out work out better for one party; send $100, other person receives $102. Or other hand, Grace might end up having to pay $103 USD (nevermind converting between fiat currencies) to get her $100 dress from the merchant. 
* Existing fiat transfer limitations will persist as either party attempts to load or redeem funds on either end of the superwallet. Paul needs time to wire USD into his Circle superwallet. Tom needs time to withdraw his CAD from his OKlink superwallet. 
* By using BTC as a trustless clearing system, limitations of the network apply to all transactions. BFX wants 3 confirms for deposits, so likewise its Superwallet will take ~30 minutes to receive a transactions. During which time, who knows what will happen to the price or exchange rates. It's possible that a superwallet could automatically hedge against changes by shorting some BTC at the same time on exchanges that support that, but what if the transaction fails for some reason? Whereas Bitpay/Coinbase has some way to handle that risk, an exchange superwallet might end up shorting 5BTC and end up never receiving the 5BTC it was expecting to complete that hedge.

Is your stomach strong enough to take a flier on bitcoin?
The value of the virtual currency can fluctuate wildly—even in a single day. From July 2010 to February 2014, its price was 26 times more volatile than the S&amp;P 500, according to Matt Elbeck, a marketing professor at Troy University in Alabama, who co-wrote a recent study about bitcoin with a colleague, Chung Baek. 
In addition, nearly a half-billion dollars worth of bitcoin disappeared last year from Mt. Gox, once the dominant exchange for bitcoin trading. And regulators are paying increasing attention to digital currencies, adding another element of uncertainty.
For many investors, those kinds of risks are reason enough to stay far away.
Yet bitcoin could have some virtues for certain investors. “It doesn’t trade with stocks or bonds or gold or any other asset that typically appears in a mass-affluent portfolio,” saysNicholas Colas, chief market strategist at New York-based brokerage firm ConvergEx Group.
There also is growth potential, given that digital currencies are in their infancy. Investment firms show growing interest in the currency and in the technology behind it, which could point to more widespread use.
This year, the value of bitcoin has fallen about 23%, through Thursday, according to a CoinDesk index. Still, a single bitcoin is worth $243.26, up from less than $5 three years ago, according to the index.
Dedicating a small sliver of your portfolio to bitcoin may make sense for a younger, affluent investor who won’t get spooked by sharp swings in value.
Mr. Elbeck says such a stake should represent less than 0.5% of your investments.
And investors who will need to tap the money in the near term—or whose finances would be compromised if the investment became more or less worthless—should stay far away, says Mark La Spisa, president of Vermillion Financial Advisors in South Barrington, Ill.
“You want to try and be a day trader with this, go ahead and have fun, as long as it won’t have a negative impact on your retirement,” Mr. La Spisa says of bitcoin and other risky investments.
Investors can purchase bitcoin online through websites such as San Francisco-based Coinbase. The currency is stored in a digital “wallet,” which could be on your computer’s hard drive, online or in an offline “vault” operated by a storage firm.
Another option could be available soon. Bitcoin Investment Trust, the first publicly traded bitcoin fund, is expected to start trading in coming weeks, according to Michael Sonnenshein, a spokesman for fund sponsor Grayscale Investments, a subsidiary of New York-based Digital Currency Group. Each share of the fund will represent about one-tenth of a bitcoin, minus fees, he says.

rePasting from other thread:


The statement is simple: a portion bitcoin's market (which happens to have capitalization of $5 bil) will be used to represent mainstream financial assets such as secondary corporate loans or private equities (which happen to have market of trillions)
DAH doesn't need to inject trillions into the bitcoin  market, in fact, the less they inject the better (for their bottom line).
Look at what DAH is offering, they are having digital representations of existing financial assets. If they use their proprietary system on top of bitcoin to transfer value for, say, a $1b corporate loan, are they going to *liquidate* $1b of that loan to buy BTC, to trade around? That's absurd. They are going to have some colored coin representing that loan, as small as say 1 satoshi for $100,000 worth of that loan.
What's the point of using BTC in equal terms of its fiat value as settlement? That's money transmission, the exact opposite of what they want. They just need to have tokens for what they are settling for their financial customers. In fact, the smaller the amount of actual BTC as token representation of an asset, the better and cheaper for them.
These colored coins/mastercoin-type things afford them all the advantages of bitcoin technology and network, and next-to-nothing of the cost.

We keep revisiting a year ago, Dec 2013. China regulations re:bitcoin are focused on financial orgs being unable to touch it. 
These exchanges/casinos that have been surging in global BTC volume share are not banned. Nothing has changed, China hasn't 'banned bitcoin but somehow it stealthily keeps chugging.' Exchanges have been running publicly as they've been allowed to all this time. Possibly the banking relationship restrictions have been slightly less strained, I dunno, but that seems largely based on the banks' decisions.
If China wanted to actually kill Bitcoin in China, they'd just shut down OKC, Huobi, BTCN, etc. 80% of BTC volume gone just like that. Bitcoin protocol blocked at Great-Firewall level. 50%+ hashrate on the network, gone just like that.

That's one of the biggest questions related to net effect on spot price. The COIN ETF has mechanism to buy more BTC to make more shares as described. As far as I understand, these are just the old BIT shares being resold. Frankly, it seems like due to lock, it's been more of an issue of old investors stuck being unable to sell.
To make new BIT shares, I think that has to come from the original Second Market BIT fund purchasing mechanism, which requires accredited investors. 
But say, if the demand on OTC would skyrocket to where it goes way over spot, and some accredited investor comes along and tries to arb by buying new ones from SM, are those coins locked up for a year too before being able to be traded OTC? Because obviously that's a terribly risky move..

Is it just me, or this completely contrary to the optimal business model for gift cards/codes from the actual retailers ?
I mean, there's that crazy stat of like $44B in unused gift cards from last half decade. 
While retailers have no control over the secondary market for gift cards, they have no incentive to make it *easier* or *better* for this market to exist. The harder it is for folks to easily/safely/securely exchange gift cards/codes/tokens, the more likely folks are going to let  unused funds sit until they are forgotten. 
Tokenizing gift codes for security even, wouldn't be a huge selling point either for the retailers. Unlike tokenizing transactions/data for credit or debit cards, any issues with a gift code being 'fraudulently' spent happens to money retailers already made from the original sale. It's not at all similar to Visa going to dispute process w/ a merchant over funds from an unauthorized charge.
TL;DR, there is practically zero incentive for any retailers to do this, and every reason for them not to.

As far as Ultracoin, I took a glance while Reggie was doing his super marketing spree through reddit, it seems to be a derivative / futures market via colored coins. He mentioned margin trading a lot too, but correct me if I'm wrong, ultimately all settlements are *only* in Ultracoins...which btw, have a separate market valuation than BTC. Since it's a colored coin, you don't need $1M of BTC to get $1M value in vericoin. It again could be totally in satoshi-range, Coinprism for example has divisibility to 18 digits. In so far as that Veritaseum is issuing colored coins, it's in their interest to have smallest BTC value to represent Ultracoin.
This is only a part of what I was imagining above with DAH, which seems to have a a more comprehensive approach w/ actual bridge to real-world assets, instead of just using an oracle to pull real-world market data for derivative settlement.

I think what might be lacking is bid depth. 
The current bids are like 10BTC worth, or 65BTC for that pile at $315/btc. 
What counts as a decently sizable bid on a spot exchange is at least 100-200 BTC. If someone flashes a 5000 share bid at $500/BTC, then I'd expect to see BIT shareholders start stirring. Of course, that also means that person who bought that much is a complete and utter idiot, but that's besides the point.

@_date: 2015-03-12 04:58:43


I didn't say they were alt coins, I read the part that they were not "non-bitcoin tokens, alt coins, sidechains or alternative blockchains". However I can't imagine how this could be done if ~~Ultracoin~~ Veritas are *not* colored BTC coins. Based on various things in the FAQ (slide 24) from their pitch deck:


Having some BTC act as a specially recognized token is the definition of a colored coin. If the system just uses plain BTC, indistinguishable one from another, how can you "buy" a Veritas with BTC? Likewise the possibility of Ultracoin-BTC having a separate valuation from BTC; if it's vanilla BTC, this cannot happen, 1BTC = 1BTC. 


It's derivatives of "anything and everything", those 45000 instruments. You can't go around trading *actual* shares of AAPL with ~~Ultracoin~~ Veritas, you're trading a derivative based on its real-world price. Edit: This includes having a Veritas derivative of a real-world derivative ...


That's pretty much what the whole Veritaseum pitch deck describes.

It would take people-time-money to setup means of receipt for bitcoins, integration into existing city financial systems, training and education of city employees, as well as spread of relevant information to the public.
In addition, advertising this means of payment may very well be taken by some as a tacit endorsement of bitcoin, which may or may not be in the City's interest given the price volatility.
While those active in the bitcoin space might understand this aspect of bitcoin as it is now, one might easily imagine a average Joe citizen trying out this hip-sounding magic-internet-money payment method after hearing about it from the City, and trying it out by buying some BTC from a BTC ATM to pay his $100 parking fine. 
Unfortunately he finds out by the time he gets home and pulls up the city website + BitPay popup that he's short 0.045 BTC, for some reason. Not understanding that the ATM charged him 5% above spot to where he really had $95 of BTC by the time he walked out the door, and a selloff started on the questionably-legit OKCoin BTC Futures market sparked a further 5% price decline by time he got off the subway, he's now left with $90 in BTC, an unpleasant feeling overall, and motivation to fire off a series of angry calls to some unfortunate sap in City Hall who is scrambling over his training documentation on why $100 isn't actually $100 anymore. 
You might ask what the difference between this and a retailer like Newegg taking bitcoin would be, and simple answer I'd imagine is that this is a government body, and especially for something like fees and fines of a certain amount that MUST be paid, over a product that someone doesn't HAVE to buy.

There are [Virtual Credit Cards]( which I personally use religiously for online purchases. It's safe enough that I've literally emailed credit card numbers in plaintext to a family member. However, this technology seems to have had little traction due to the effort needed on part of the customer to generate one of these things (takes about a full minute from start to end for me to login to my bank website and work through the flashed-based UI. Yes, Flash.).
I see inevitably the major players turning to actively pushing some sort of controlled/tokenized payment system onto mainstream consumers once things like ApplePay and bitcoin help ingrain the notion that an extra step of effort with a secure device is worth the security. I find it hard to imagine that Visa/MC couldn't right now put together a phone app that generates one of those VCCs in 10 seconds. Heck, they probably could implement a QR-code reading app that transmits directly to the processor, which on on the user-end experience end is almost just like bitcoin.

I'm trying to understand the premise of the Proof of Burn. In concept, it seems like it should ideally represent someone willing to put monetary weight behind their rating of something. 
Let's go ahead and **completely** ignore the whole issue with the reliability of anonymous reviews. Heck let's even pretend that someone could stake an established pseudonymous identity on a review web-of-trust. Problem is that each proof of burn is not tied to any particular review, rating, or identity. Burns are only positive ranking effect, there is no way to put weight behind a negative rating. As such, it is not a meaningful weighting factor. It is purely a **buy-rank factor**.  


Sure, it's only 30%. But why does it exist in the first place as it is, when the **prevailing motivation**, orders of magnitude greater than any legit review, is for the listed entity to buy its own ranking above others. 
It's literally a game of bigger pockets, until one listing realizes this is an utterly inane system and they should stop burning money.
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:01:16
You may take it for what it is, yet right there it affects 30% of a listings rankings. 
Again, for however much or little ratings and reviews could mean, burn is infinitely less meaningful, yet represents a significant portion of rankings.

If it's all true, 250K BTC of accumulation (not volume) is a staggering amount. 
That is more than Stamp had at peak of its reserves, 1/3(ish?) the total coins on Gox, and 5x more than the [peak]( of order book ask depth. 
I mean, let's say a conservative estimate of $250/avg a coin that it bought (do we have avg data somewhere on willy report?). That's equivalent of $62.5M of imaginary fiat pumped into the market. That's far more than what Draper ($20M?) and BIT Syndicate ($17M?) have put into the auctions combined. Based on Second Market Observer data, you can throw in their total investment in USD up to Gox's closing as well (~$30m).
If that doesn't have a massive effect on price, I don't know what does.
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:54:27
You can't calculate it. You can only point out estimates on parts of it.
The total auction estimates from round  and  were ~$37M. ~60M from Second Market BIT fund. Let's say completely equal to that at Pantera (no idea about them honestly). $55M in liabilities from the MtGox crisis document 'leak'. Who knows, maybe equal to that on Bitstamp, though it's peak Bid depth was maybe half of MtGox's, extrapolate what you will out of that.
A lot of these numbers include funds put in after Gox ($50m at least in auctions + BIT fund). I'm sure there is a lot more OTC trading and whatnot, but you're talking about only a quarter billion from the few I've listed. How many orders of magnitude off is that?

Disclaimer: following is all complete guesswork pulled out of my imagination
The digital tokens can traded back and forth as much as people like, but the exact settlement in real world maybe doesn't have to occur immediately. Say, a bunch of corporate loans around 5-6 times a day digitally, but real world settlement only needs to happen when whoever owns the tokens in the end wants to claim it. Compare that same process the old way without coins, then each trade would require a real-world settlement as it passed ownership, since each owner in turn can't obviously trade the thing again until it's in their hands. With a coin, that 'ownership' is proven by just blockchain transactions.
For something already familiarly digital in nature, like fiat for a stock, nowadays it's just entries in a database at a brokerage firm. You trade a stock, ownership of that share changes from your name to another in the brokerage database and your USD account database field gets adjusted accordingly (I may be slightly simplifying it). Difference with colored coins would be that security of the ownership database is based on the blockchain, that 'owner name' change is cryptographically signed and can't be arbitrarily changed, and complete history of that stock is stored immutably. If doing this with fiat for stock w/ colored coins, I suppose you'd go to DAH and put like $10M in collateral, they issue 1000 satoshis of "$10K" colored coins, and you go find someone with stock-coins to trade with. As before, IRL settlement for the stock and USD occurs only whenever someone wants it. 
The cool or useful thing I suppose, which I'm not sure is currently possible in traditional markets, is that you could trade anything for anything, not just whatever a brokerage lets you do. Private equities traded directly for a ownership of a classic art piece, it's just tokens moved around until you settle IRL. 
In all this, I suppose DAH's service would be to ensure real-world settlement occurs, acting as escrow or something (not sure what proper term that would be), with trades on its platform being legally binding contracts as agreed upon by its participants. 
As far as what the point is, it's the ease of making multiple transactions between settlements (that way, instead of having the fiat transfer overhead through tradition channels 30 times, it only needs to happen once from the person who first put up fiat for colored coins, and the last person who redeems it), and potentially trading anything for anything. Obviously DAH will take their cut at any point they can for middlemanning these trades. I did mention that since they piggyback off the blockchain, they don't have to maintain the security of the transaction database or network at all.

[The Forbes article]( is a bit more informative about the C&amp;C potential of OP_RETURN which has had proof-of-concept. The actual infection doesn't need to have anything to do with the blockchain.
Gavin had some comments against the idea of using the blockchain this way:


I'd argue that expense isn't a big deal; txs can be sent with no miner fee and don't even need to be confirmed, just broadcast sufficiently along the network. As far as visibility, botnets have used things as twitter and whatnot for C&amp;C, about as public as it gets. As a possible benefit even of having no-fee transactions, if txs stay unconfirmed or even get double spent, then there isn't even any record.
TL;DR it's a legitimate possibility that will probably increase in likelihood the bigger bitcoin gets, and one that will continue to come up in ongoing conversation about the potential 'dangers' of data on a public digital ledger that no one can simply shut down. 
Also, no one commenting here seems to have actually read either article. No surprise there.
Edit: Apparently you can stick way more data into txs via outputs over OP_RETURN, as evidenced by the bitcoin whitepaper PDF encoded into 900+ outputs.

True about Seals is tiny in comparison. 
I guess my point is, what does BTC integration allow for that's different? For people who *can* do PS now, it's another means of funding (next to Paypal, Visa, dozen other methods). For those people who don't have access to banking or any of those other funding means and still really want to gamble (hmmm), it's certainly a new feature. But not anon.
For people who can't legally gamble PS (like in the US), this doesn't really help. I mean, if you could play PS anonymously this would be massive. But you still get cockblocked by AML, US players still have to do VPNs and fake identities, and if that's the big selling point then I'm not sure how I feel about the inevitable MSM headlines, "Bitcoin turns from facilitating illicit online drug trade to illegal online gambling". PS is on thin ice with USGov, I'm pretty sure this is a big thing they will be trying to prevent with BTC integration.

Semantics of "market cap" applied to a commodity-like thing that crypto is aside, yes, the "market cap" has been calculated as supply * $USD traded per unit. I guess it went up to even $13B at the time. 
This number has **practically nothing** to do with the actual fiat in the market. 
Edit: This is going to take a lot more effort to explain if this isn't obvious. I'll just say to look at LTC. It peaked at $1B market cap. Do you really think a billion USD went into the LTC market? This is **not** what 'market cap' means.

Sandboxing, a separate limited user account, or a VM is the reverse of what you want to do with the thing you actually do trust, Electrum. That would limit what could get **out** of Electrum to the rest of the system, your concern is actually everything else. 
What you would want short of a separate physical machine, is more along the lines of a secondary encrypted volume that boots into a clean environment with only Electrum.

This is based purely off a small set of observations about 3 weeks ago as I was checking price on Gox vs Coinbase:

The Gox 'security' measure of rolling back large sell orders was at ~$875-825. This means it was already down from 1200, mid-drop to the 550 low, and more than half a day after the announcement in China. It's not a bug, it's a feature (/s) that's happened once before already in the last month or so, and all the other exchanges stayed relatively stable during this hour or so.
For once, Gox isn't the reason or 'trigger' for this drop.

A car being a simple example, surely it'd be easy to apply the analogy across any purchase, from food and clothing to housing and electronics. Why does anyone need a fancy car, or a $50 t-shirt? 
If you don't **need** anything beyond the essential, why are you hoarding wealth in the first place, except in the rare case of total economic collapse--whereby no one else can afford a loaf of bread with their worthless fiat (bad money), and the chosen few can still eat by means of their BTC (transferred via the somehow still-functioning internet infrastructure).
The majority of folks holding through thick and thin through 'crashes' and whatnot, do so with belief in the protocol and network, that its intrinsic value will only become more evident and stronger vs fiat. However, the end game is still they are (astronomically) increasing their own holdings value. 
Would you fault them for wanting to have a luxury car with this gained wealth? In what cases, is 'good money' spent correctly, vs incorrectly?

From this [customer support page]( :






The first sentence seems to suggest that risk is related the user...that is to say, if you buy these coins, are you going to charge it back from your bank? This seems a bit disingenuous given that many people had established their reputation with prior history of successful transactions before getting a "high risk" cancellation, and the fact there's a built-in 10/100BTC limit for transactions anyhow. It's ridiculous to claim calculation that a person who was previously trustworthy suddenly became untrustworthy.
So then, it's not the user that's high risk, its the transaction that's high risk. From watching the charts, it seems that the sell price as offered on Coinbase's sell page is a function of the current bid level, and buy price is function of the current ask level (I guess that bots who do these penny transactions are aimed at gaming this type of system sorta). Since coinbase gets coins through mtgox, I suppose that the "machine learning algorithim" takes a rough guess if it can actually get the current price for the amount bought or sold, based on the available volume and whatever transaction turnaround time there is. More or less what you described, but possibly not as long as the x-days transfer time and more like a few minutes/hours.
If the safe margin of what's available vs what transaction sum is too small, then they cancel it since they'd suffer a loss.

A peak of the trend in April was literally the day of and after the bubble, about the pop specifically. If you zoom into April 2013, the 9th was at 56, the 10th was at 86, and 11th at 100 on the index. 
Makes sense, if you recall that the bubble pop was definitely the bigger main stream media story.
The highest we got last week was 44, so it's not that low on the index in comparison. Given that the stories aren't about a similar pop, that's not bad.

I think it might be less of not buying a computer (essential tool to pretty much anyone in the first to third world) or basic needs like groceries, vs buying a new car. 
In a simple scenario: If I had no car and needed to buy one and it were possible back in April to do so with BTC, no way I would have bought a Tesla knowing (or hoping) the future price to be what it is now. I would have gotten a cheap used Civic to get myself around for a few months, because now I would have been able to afford a Lamborghini with BTC. But then again, if I wait a little bit more, maybe I'll just move right up to a G6...

The article they linked is from mid 2011. Goes without saying the landscape as changed a bit since then, w/ things like that legally recognized Bitcoin bank in France just recently.  
More importantly, there are payment processors that give them a free pass buffer from the actual bitcoins transactions, making points 1 and 2 largely irrelevant.
As far as point 3 of people's perception that partnership w/ a bitcoin payment processor is some sort of endorsement is silly. You might as well argue that taking USD via Paypal, amazon, google, is endorsing the US economy or those companies over any others.

Alternatively, VirtualBox + TrueCrypt. Parent's point was, to protect the VM container in which the wallet would be held.

If you recall, the context of OP's post was that he was no longer going to download unsure/sketchy software because it might result in malicious software getting onto his PC, stealing his BTC.
proposed locking the encrypted wallet inside an encrypted VM. His supposition, as well as yours, is that because it's protected by (2 layers of) encryption, the virus will not be able to get into it. 
This might be true if you simply had a copy of the VDI/VHD files by themselves. You couldn't get into the VM to start with, much less the wallet therein.
The flaw with this approach is that it alone does not assure security of ones BTC if there is malicious software present on the host OS, after downloading random keygens or whatnot. If you ever actually access your wallet while infected, then the malicious software will likely have keylogged your VM encryption key, as well as your wallet encyption key. Putting the wallet inside the VM is no different from having just an encrypted wallet in the end, it serves no greatly useful purpose. 
Sure, if you never access the wallet, then you'll be ok. But then you're stuck in a rather awkward situation where you have a container you can never safely open. Do you have a virus? Maybe. Maybe your antivirus/anti-malware caught it. But then again, if your anti-malware was so reliable against every 0-day (which we never hear they fail at, after all /s), then you wouldn't have to worry about any downloads at all.
It would be far more sensible to put all the potentially sketchy things like keygens inside the VM, so they can't get out to your real OS where your wallet is. In fact, this is the preferred approach if you download anything uncertain.
