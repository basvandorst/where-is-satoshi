You must be from the USA. Balance to balance isn't free at all. When i was in europe the fee was 0.35$ + 3.5% (even for accounts in the same country). And in asia it's the same 0.35$ + 3.5%.
Also, it took paypal 5-7 business days to withdraw to bank account (both Europe and in Asia). Which had another fee (that i forgot). Morale of the story, unless inside USA, don't use Paypal.

The answer is in the bitcoin whitepaper, page 1,  Introduction...
"...no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party."
If they have never run an online business, they wont understand. Disputes cost a lot of money, because banks shove the dispute-cost onto the payment-processors (ie: paypal) and payment-processors shove the dispute-cost onto merchants, meanwhile banks and payment-processors collect fees for all transactions even if they fail to identify a stolen cc, identity, bankaccount etc. When a fraudulent transaction takes place, banks doesn't lose anything, payment-processors (ie: paypal) doesn't neither, the merchant takes the entire hit PLUS the fees to banks and payment-processors, consequently the consumer pays in form of higher price due to the risk.
And this is why bitcoin is useful, with bitcoin you are the bank both as a customer and as a merchant.

In other words it's a zero-sum game camouflaged under the central banks monetary policy. 
+1% inflation = +1% in: wages, spending, investment, lending at the expense of -1% in savings.  
-1% inflation = -1% in: wages, spending, investment, lending at the expense of +1% in savings.
Inflation isn't a tax, but it's pointless if most of your citizens can do math, they'll know where to run, effectively cancelling your stimulous-plan.
The only reason inflation appears to "stimulate" the economy is because at least 50% of your citizens can't do math.
