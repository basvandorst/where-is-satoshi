That's awesome!

Yea, sorry for that. I posted this one first but Reddit it did not show up so I thought it wasn't successful. Who would've thought it came back 4 hours later and I just find out about it too...

The signing process is literally to sign the hash of a msg(or transaction). The transaction as input data to the Ellipal wallet can be produced by any other program instead of Ellipal app. The output of the signature also can be decoded by any 3rd party software. 
To verify signing integrity, a known imported key for testing propose and an unsigned transaction from any 3rd party program can be applied. Then the output signature can be easily compared with other wallets or programs to check if the output is by the imported key or another changed key.

As a hardware wallet manufacturer, I honest suggest keeping your coins in a form of a steel wallet is a better option and recover when needed. Hardware wallet will go through various firmware updates and model change which might actually take you more time to get back on track than recovering Bip39 seed phrases. Furthermore, steel wallets can withstand unimaginable harsh conditions so much better than a hardware wallet can.  
Either way, if you still insist to hide your hardware wallet and not touch for years, consider getting mounts like these:

Yes, Ellipal uses the Allwinner A64 chipset and a customized Android system.

ELLIPAL data transafer from hardware to the App is based on open-format QR code. (
QR code scanning is also controlled manually by user. All the data transferred is entirely dependent on the users' scanning. There will be no dark data.
Everbody can verify the data of the QR code. We provide an opensource Javascrip lib (
The signature or nonce transfered out from hardware wallet can be checked in the QR code so there is no chance to do the mix of an attacker_pubkey and imported privkey.

You can use coin converter services like Changelly to convert your coin to another currency and send to your new wallet, then convert it back. What Changelly does is receive your coins and send back another set of coins which has no connection. This is also another way to get rid of "dusts". It is the same as getting a new set of coins.

ELLIPAL is a fully airgapped device without any components or ports to allow private keys to be sent back to the server. The comment below suggests that QR code can contain private keys however, our QR code generation are open sourced and can be checked and verified at any point in time to no contain private keys.

Not your keys not your coins, check out a secure cold hardware wallet like the ELLIPAL which is 100% airgapped.

If you are talking about Cold Wallets, I also want to bring your attention to our solution which is the ELLIPAL Cold Wallet 
ELLIPAL Wallet is a 100% airgapped device without any ports or components capable of connecting to other online devices. BIP39/44 private keys can be created inside the device or imported from your trusted source. Device works using QR codes with ELLIPAL App to sign transactions. Cross wallet framework and JS Lib is available on ELLIPAL github.
Currently we are looking for people to audit our air-gapped claim.

This research was done by Ledger donjon for our Bounty program. They informed us of the vulnerability and also decided to include it in their presentation. 
This research was directed at our first generation product. We have worked upon the issues found and released our second generation product, the ELLIPAL Titan. We have changed to a new chipset that does not include any component capable of connecting to other devices as well as removed the USB port. The hacks possible written in this research is now not possible.
This is a good review of the ELLIPAL Titan:

The ELLIPAL cold device is a fully offline device. The device is built without any single component or port capable of connecting to an online device. Transactions are only signed via QR codes. It is completely secure from any remote attacks. 
Supply chain attacks are also common for hardware wallets. What we do is we include anti-disassembly and anti-tamper features which will 1) Make it very difficult to disassemble and will leave permanent damage if so, 2) deletes your data if system spots a breach. 
Althought our solution is just partially open sourced ( we address this concern by allowing users to input their own private key or use passphrase. We are a new company in relation to others so we understand the concerns. We want to do everything on the table and will get more tests and audits for everyone to see.

Yes we understand your views on the matter here as we are not in the market for as long other famous brands. Hopefully, with our good working product, it will be time proven and we will gain more trust. If there anything you want to know about us, we are happy to answer :)

Thank you OP.
If you are looking for QR code based and mobile oriented cold wallet (fully disconnected from any online devices), drop us a message:

Hello Anders, I think what that person meant was the ELLIPAL is a hardware wallet but because it is 100% connection free, it is also a cold wallet. It is easy to use like a hardware wallet (or even easier than many) while it has the 100% connection free security feature of a cold wallet. 
I invite you to learn more about other features of the ELLIPAL Titan, not only security at

I read lots of the comments here, the scenarios brought up here are dangerous but also very real. At gun point, anything is possible.
I am from ELLIPAL Hardware Wallet. I do care about security but right now I do not see how HW wallets can stop this kind of theft. Does anyone has a good idea for us to develop to protect the users?
