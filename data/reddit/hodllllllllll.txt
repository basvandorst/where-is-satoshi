You invested in BTC to risk losing your BTC to LN because BTC should of solved this issue years ago?
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:06:44
Yes. Spread it out. Max 10% in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:47:53
Oh the irony. HAHAHAHA
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:43:16
Yes, you just have to be unretarded. 
But looking at your sad history, that's impossible.

Good job!

Interesting why you only post this on r/bitcoin......
Oh wait I know, because other subs are allowed to criticize. 
Maybe I'll cross post it
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:54:10
Wow. Another stupid topic no one cares about and you got embarrassed on. 
Good job

@_date: 2017-12-24 08:13:44
Because it's the main trading pair for alts. 
So you have to buy bitcoin to exchange to your alts. 
Do you not understand
And who said it failed? You just like twisting words so you have something to argue against
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:51:47
It's 8 year old technology.........
You are throwing about the term "early tech" way too lightly. 
Should of progressed better then this, but this is why I feel other coins have came to exist. Because bitcoin took too long too find solutions.
Take any technology and look at it 8 years ago compared to today, it's completely different and advanced to suit the current needs. Anything that doesn't, gets left behind. 
Most technology progresses ALOT in 8 years, and bitcoins plan from the beginning was mass adoption and worldwide use by anyone and lots of cheap transactions. 
Creating something to solve those problems(bitcoin) and not having a solution to what you are going for, 8 years later, really is troubling.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:21:32
Can you please post some proof of you selling at $5600 and buying bitcoin cash at $2400?
Sorry to say but with out proof, many people don't believe you and it makes it look like a troll post
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:21:11
"Those people" I can assume that includes you as you seem upset. 
Nothing wrong with only risking $100, but when people act like it's life altering or expected to be a millionaire in a week, it's annoying. 
I wish Reddit had a mandatory verification to prove how much each person has invested in each coin. Would be helpful if it showed a user, his balance then his screaming "WTF DO I DO. AM I FUCKED. IM GUNNA SELL SO I DONT LOSE. IT WILL NEVER RECOVER. TRUST ME" {user balance: 0.00738463 BTC}
And if a true long time hodler was telling everyone to "relax, it's a small dip/20% correction, it will be ok in a few weeks or month. Don't freak out" {user balance: 4.72528493 BTC}
Etc etc for all coins. 
Yes it's a dream but a fucking sexy one.
Edit: maybe a private sub where you need to verify your holdings to join.

@_date: 2017-12-02 09:48:22
This thread is about not calling it bitcoin cash for the sole reason to discredit bitcoin cash. 
All I know is that the bitcoin devs better get go on the transaction price and speed or people will switch coins for daily use, not for the name, but for their usability. 
I know I have many different coins and I avoid paying with bitcoin any chance I get because I know the fees will be high and it will take a lot longer. 
If I can I use ether or bch. Both cheaper and faster. 
Again, don't get me wrong. 70% of my portfolio is BTC but fighting over a name is childish. Why not just work to make bitcoin better then bitcoin cash, and you won't have to keep trying to stop people from using it and discrediting bitcoin cash, BTC would be the better one so you wouldn't have to worry this much ;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:02:37
Ya he's passionate about what he believes in. 
I am not going to say that's a negative trait to have on anyone. Whether youre a business owner, doctor, teacher, or whatever, passion for what you do is a great thing. 
He never once said it was doomed in that interview by the way. He did speak lots of truth though. He said how bitcoin is expensive to use, etc. 
What exactly was incorrect that was said? 
Or he just pointed out the negatives to the public so you didn't like it?
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:24:34

LOL that's your guys only response now. 
And why would I waste my time? So many other coins that aren't in trouble like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:09:29

Its alway's funny when people's have too resort too tryin 2 check someones writin becuz they have no other comeback
(Have fun with that sentence)
Thats how we can tell you have no friends also. No one would put up with a loser friend correcting their texts to them. 
Sad sad life you must have. 
All I know is I'm glad I'm not you. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:27:39
How do? Lol. Didn't get aggressive at all. 
But usually when people have no comeback they just use whatever was said against them and try to flip it back
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:26:25
What about bitcoin gold then?
Why aren't you so mad about that. 
Make them change it to bgold too then. 
I don't see why you guys are so scared of bitcoin cash. And try anything to take it down a notch. 
Why not working to improve bitcoin? 
I guarantee you if bitcoin had cheap and fast transactions like bitcoin cash, bitcoin cash would be useless and no one would care about it. 
You guys got yourselfs into this situation and are scared it seems. 
(FYI I owe both coins. Mostly BTC and I'm not a bitcoin cash shill, just pointing out obvious points)
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:45:33
Exactly. 
What I feel will happen is all this talk and hype and hopes and dreams of LN, when/if it ever rolls out, will crash bitcoin as it will be way to much work to use and the other coins will be developed even better then they are now. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:06:10
Ya noob, this is bitcoin, you can only use it when it's convenient for the miners
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:31:01
Oh no please don't downvote me. I'm a fucking loser like you and care about downvotes so much. They ruin my life. Please don't do it. I will change my mind and agree with whatever you say!
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:11:05
Where the fuck would bitcoin be without coinbase. Holy fuck. Talk about ungrateful. 
So you are mad they said they would introduce more coins and you honestly thought bitcoin cash wouldn't be chosen? (Even after they said they would allow bitcoin cash withdrawals for users coins from the fork)
What did you expect to happen?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:21:44
Ok mr techie. Tell me how lightning works....
I am not a bitcoin cash troll. 
You clearly have no understanding of it at all if you think it's gunna be so easy for everyone to use when people can't even figure out segwit. 
Lightning is a mess. Opening and closing channels. Running a node. 
I'm not arguing with someone who doesn't know what he's arguing for.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:11:07

Ya bitcoin core trolls are at work on bitcoin cashs GitHub, that's already well known. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:45:08
There's a new bullshit story like this every week it seems. 
It's getting old. And less and less believable every time
Ex bitcoin miner "forgets" about his bitcoins for __ years then finds an old computer and remembers the bitcoin all of a sudden and everything works perfectly. 
Blah blah blah
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:22:05
But bitcoin cash is a split (or main chain) from the bitcoin original. 
If it's from the bitcoin chain, having the name bitcoin in it makes sense. 
If it was a whole new start up coin, not using the same block chain, then yes it would be wrong to have bitcoin in its name
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:12:30

It's gunna get worse before it gets better
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:30:14
Ya don't listen to his 'consensus'.
Nothing is guaranteed in bitcoin. People are forgetting that in the last few months. So many gains and ATHs, it's seems stupid not to dump your life savings into it. 
Don't invest/bet more then you can afford to lose. So if you are 100% ready to live in a cardboard box if shit hits the fan, and accept the decision you made, then you can do whatever your heart desires. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:41:12

What other coins carry such a risk?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:19:23

Bullshit. Tell us which exchange and what time so we can believe you. 
Also screenshots of any transaction if you really ain't shittin us.

@_date: 2017-12-24 03:39:59
Value doesn't matter when you are talking about when the technology STARTED. 
8 years ago. 
Just cuz it didn't have value til later doesn't matter. 
If cell phones came out in 1990 but not many people used them till 2000, does that mean the technology started in 2000?

Get over yourself buddy. Your a frat boy. No one respect you. 
And no, you clearly don't understand what OPs point was then. Haha
No where in there does it say that. He's talking about people like you (micro investors). 
But I'm not going to explain sentences to the stupid aka arrogant frat boys.

Ok bud. Keep holding on to that life line of "lightning network will save us from drowning"
Btw, do you know how it works and what people have to go through during the process of using it........?
If not, educate yourself about it then still try to tell me it's better then any other coin. 
Please ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:18:26
LOL. 
Do you know the cost to open and close a channel? Plus you need to run a node. 
Wtf. It's chaos and not user friendly (unlike almost every othe coin)
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:53:01
Ya good point. As crypto starts to take off as a currency anywhere, there will be stores that move the decimal over 1 or 2 spots 'by accident'. 
We are trying to re education the whole population about something they have used their whole life, all day every day every where. It's gunna be a long fight
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:01:36
What's the typical response again?
Oh ya,
ITS AN ATTACK!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:32:19
Ya because the owners probably retired with what your bitcoin is worth now. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:22:17
Free Ross ulbricht!
Lol. (Silk Road admin). His site probably help bitcoin get more widely used
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:37:25
Ya none of them get used as bitcoin does you say, but also bitcoin has an 8 year head start. And now you can see more people going away from accepting bitcoin, rather than adding it. 
And it's only going to get worse. 
Bitcoin had its chance 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:13:50
So you say it's gone through 8 years of ecosystem and development, but they still couldn't figure out how to handle more transactions? 
Thats very very worrying that they let it get this bad AND STILL have no agreeable fix
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:12:03

So stfu micro $100 investor.

There was no deadline. Just 8 years to prepare for what they dreamed of happening since day 1
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:43:52
Ya I agree it would be best for them to use bitcoin cash for speed of transactions and super cheap fees. 
But monero is best for privacy and easy to use also.

Maybe you need to learn more of the technical side of bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:22:10
Lol. Any negative comment about bitcoin is a life threatening "attack" now everyone says.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:07:01
What does it matter?
If I have a couch and you call it a sofa, is that so wrong?
People can call things as they see it. Doesn't really matter. 
Plus, who's to say the bitcoin cash chain is the alt chain?
Maybe it's the improved chain, and this bitcoin legacy chain is the old one bitcoin tried to leave behind
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:15:19
Oh I believe them. 
Multiple of them. 
I can't see them making up stories quite like that and going on camera.

Agreed to some extent. But if bitcoin does crap out, the other coins go out too, yes..... for a bit. But the alts would rise while bitcoin was permanently buried.

AND I ESPECIALLY don't respect frat boys. 
Now run along little arrogant frat boy and suck your masters dick again. 
No frat boy, didn't steal my gf because the only girls frat boys get are fat, ugly, immature bitches with no morals.

Share the transaction info and proof then............
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:30:40
A few thousand invested is good. That's higher then most I feel. I would enjoy nice chats with other serious investors rather then the $100 crew here
Maybe instead of mandoratory balances displayed, have a private group/sub that you have to eat verified to join so it's only all more serious investors. Then the advice and tips would be a lot more meaningful
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:22:47
Can you show me where I said fundamentally broken? Don't twist my words
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:52:23

List all of the bugs. 
You are just making shit up now. 
Oh and you say decentralization is the basic idea of cryptos, but fast and cheap transactions are also the main concept. 
So 3 out of 3 ain't bad (say 2/3 if you think it's already centralized). 
What's bitcoin? 1 out of 3?  Ouch
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:42:09

Typical way of thinking by the OP......
Anything negative or bad on bitcoin is a bitcoin cash "attack". 
I'm glad I'm not that simple minded 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:14:25
Ya it's annoying as most people throw $40 at a coin and shill it hard. I got a lot ALOT more into coins then most people on these subs. And these little bitches with $100 "investments" crying and stressed out over a value drop of $10 for them lololol
Bitcoin hit $18k then went to $13k. I lost value of just under $10k from that dip. JUST IN BITCOIN on those days. But check my history. I didn't Bitch, moan or give a fuck. I just held that shit and know It's part of the game. 
Hodl is easier said then done for most people. 
But after you pop your first ~5 major dips, you become immune (almost).
Your gf knows bitcoin and alts are dipping as you have not said a word about them all day so she even has learned to not ask how it's doing, because of we aren't telling them shits going good, they have learned not to bring it up :P
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:43:30
Exactly. Finally someone understands what he's saying. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:37:23
Yes but at the same time, you gotta be prepared for growth that you are trying to obtain and mass adoption and daily use as planned. 
Any enterprise has to prepare for what they are aiming for. 
This really is embarrassing. 
Finally getting some 'mass' adoption, but driving people away at the exact same time. 
All the years of work are going to benefit other coins now because they wasn't capable to handle these problems they should of knew were coming.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:51:45
It's sad they had nothing else to compare bitcoin too. It's really embarrassing anyone takes them serious when they compare modern technology against selling flowers from how many hundreds of years ago. LOLOLOLOLOLOL. 
Hopefully next they compare dinosaurs to popcorn
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:50:16
Ya but there wasn't other better cryptos around. 
It's a whole different market now and a drop like this could be the time another coin reigns supreme. Back then, no chance of that happening.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:21:21
You're saying growing pains and people will come back, but now with all the other cryptos around, I think it's going to take something really really special to bring people back to use bitcoin after they go to other coins that are cheap and easy to use
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:05:22
Holy fuck buddy. Reddit is not the place for acronym corrections. LOL

He's saying 'grow up and drop the bitcoin cash drama'
Not the memes, not the price pictures as you think. 
He says DRAMA. What is the most drama on here I ask you?????
What is it?!?? 
Bitcoin Cash crybaby drama 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:40:20
Same here. I don't see bitcoin going 2x or 3x now, But lots of alts will and it's an easy EASY 2x-5x. Even more on some. I have a few I am confident will be 10x return. 
I just made almost 50x on verge. 
Bought at 0.0047. It's now 0.24. 
50x in a few months, ya bitcoin did ok for a bit. But the days of huge returns are gone. Time to more on
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:51:49
Wrong. They will schedule 1 billion to be released at each time.

Everyone so sour they sold their bitcoin cash at $300 huh?
I'd be mad too if I screwed up and lost thousands and thousands of dollars out of stupidity. 
I forgive you
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:21:56
All the extra money from bitcoin cash will make up for the 28 redditors leaving coinbase. 
Plus they will be adding more coins soon. More profits. I really doubt they care about a minuscule amount of people. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:52:47

Good for you
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:54:17
True. If your in it for the long term and don't plan on selling til a certain price, aths don't matter too much besides getting a bit less coin
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:20:35
Besides lay under a hammock and have girls poop in his mouth......?
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:54:47
Agreed. I can see $10k end of next year for sure
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:52:26
Wayyyyy different comparison. Not fair. 
Big difference buying 1 BTC at 4500 or 5000 and it going to 7000. Than $3-5 and it going to $7000. 
So unless you plan on holding till it hits $1,000,000 then no, it wouldn't matter. But currently it kind of does
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:19:00
Lots of people thought that about this last BTC gold fork also. 
Still waiting for its "post fork dip"........

Ya I agree. 10k should be considered mooned. 
I hated it when it was at $4000 and people were "here we go to the moon". 
How was $2000 or $3000 or $4000 not good enough?

@_date: 2017-11-27 09:16:53
Calm down junior. It went up a thousand or 2 in a couple days and now your screaming $100,000. Lol
What would the market cap be at $100,000/BTC?
Honestly think it can hit that so quick with something that doesn't work right?
They need to get on the transaction speed/price befor it can get that big
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:19:31
Agreed. I traded 0.4 bitcoin for 5.2 bcc cash the day before it rocketed. 
Was super pissed but luckily I played it right and both went up so I traded about 5.1 bcc back for 0.39something BTC yesterday. 
Very little loss but I got my BTC back!
Lesson learned!!

@_date: 2017-11-02 03:51:38
That's true if you spread it out over small increments yes that is best. But lots of people just set a buy of say $100 each Monday or something. That's where the luck comes in. 
But if you space that out to $15 per day instead, you have a better chance of getting a better average
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:48:34
You say any exchange that changes to bch from BTC, would be halving their customers.
I don't understand how so?
Just because the customers don't have bch at the time, they can easily change their BTC to bch to use on the exchange. It will just be different pairs is all. I don't get why you think they would lose half their customers. 
Also, if a decent size exchange did switch the main trading pair to bch, its value would have a massive increase. But I don't see why any exchange would do it. Not because of 'halving' their customers, but more so because it's not nessacary.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:47:20
selling at 10k, paying 3k or 5k makes quite a difference yes. 
If you think it'll hit $10,000,000 before you sell, then no 3 or 5k isn't a big deal
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:25:51
True true

I asked before for a 'how to' on using segwit. No one knows how and no one talks about it.

Wtf are taxes. 
By pass that shit or you are just a slave to the government. 
They own you
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:27:20
LMFAO. Are you serious?
You defense for being taxed when you don't live in the USA anymore is...
-So you can vote (if not living in USA or no plans to go back, who the fuck cares about voting)
-in case North Korea kidnaps you (HAHA WTF)
-sightseeing in Iraq and get isis kidnaps you (again, wtf)
Wow. You are right sir, America should tax you for life no matter where you live. But if you are fine with it, and that's how you justify it, good for you. 
And yes it is modern day slavery. "I am the American government, if you want to be a member of my land you must pay me a percent of your earnings for life. if you break any of my rules, I will put you in prison also"
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:25:28
Not fair though because you are assuming bitcoins main use with be for futures. 
Don't forget bitcoin has real world usages, and will continue to build in those areas. 
Your stock market crashes were a different case. 
Very unfair comparison IMHO
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:55:20
How the fuck is the total market cap of a certain coin meaningless?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:25:58
Exactly. 
I love bitcoin and ain't hatin on it. But there needs to be lots of changes to make it daily used and mass adopted. 
It's a store of value like gold.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:29:47
Ya if I had a day job, I would of quit it like a boss!
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:06:38
Exactly. 
Just because some people call BTC bitcoin, doesn't mean it is. 
I can call a couch a sofa, and you can call it a couch. Doesn't mean one of us is wrong. Just different opinions on its name, which is allowed. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:02:37
Why would I want more people to buy it? So the price drops?

Do bitcoins actually get held or traded?............
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:22:14
How does it remove the factor of luck?
You might have it set and buy at an ath or it could be right perfectly in a dip. 
I don't see how a computer generated buy time is not classified as lucky timing or not 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:16:10
I agree. Too many people making too much money. Lots of people will be taking profits. I think it will be a wave of drops as more people take their profits as they are scared of it dropping farther. 
But me, I hodl 
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:36:25

I'm sure you have things that swing your mood too. 
Maybe a sport? Watch a game and get a bit angered? Yell at refs, want a guy suspended, hate certain plays.....
Because he is emotional about something he loves and cares for, is hardly a reason to attack a guy. 
But all you really see on this sub is personal attacks. It's sad really

Is this the douche that said it's mostly for money laundering?
God I hope so
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:56:16
The point of buying the dips is to get the most coins. 
If it goes to $20,000/BTC. 0.001 is a bit of money ;)
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:00:52
Tears of joy?
Yes you are correct!
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:27:26
Exactly. I like the one meme on here about "I am not buying bitcoin, I am selling fiat"
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:18:15
I don't like the idea of luck deciding what price I get it at though. 
Just kind of wake up and hope for the best?

Now just greedy. 
It'll be a million and people will want more moon
The only people screaming "moon. Moon" are the ones who bought in over $4000
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:44:08
Ok, then please list these other things "littered in history". 
Note; they can't have self destructed or failed for some weird reason. Only list ones that you can compare to bitcoin. 
PLUS any other things you list will not be in the 'currency' and 'worldwide use/adoption' category like bitcoin. So you will just be trying to compare apples to oranges I bet. 
This will be interesting.......
(I would wait for a reply, but I know you won't answer back now)

No no. Wrong   
Not many people think it will be a primary currency. 
What a stupid think to say. 
Some might, yes. But very few think it will be the worlds primary currency. 
you would be correct to say many people believe it will be a good commodity in people's lives, yes. Almost like gold was. But more easily exchangeable everywhere, online and in real life purchases. 
Any other wild guesses you wanna try out there?

@_date: 2017-10-15 02:49:06
Did you read the twitter comments???
Harsh replies by the common folk who dont use bitcoin or didn't invest it in. Lots of negative comments. 
Kind of interesting to read cuz on here we are all bitcoin shillers and bag holders we forget the average everyday lame person who has not yet saw the light.

Get over yourself. 
Most people will be selling for their profits.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:06:52
I focus only on dips (that I feel is a dip that is). 
1st of the month and shit can suck because it have a $300 spike that day. Then you buy and it has a correction. Therefore if you waited a bit longer, could of got more. 
Plus if people always buy dips, it can stop it from dipping. It's sellin on dips that screws us all
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:18:40
Just weird that you think of bitcoin now. There's been many new stories about the price in recent months.

@_date: 2017-10-26 00:49:16
No it's not. 
If it fell believe $5200-$5300 it had a chance to drop all the way to $4300. 
It didn't hit those levels and has gained strength. If we get a day above $5800 we could test out $6100 in a week or less

No way. 
Completely wrong
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:04:05
BTC will ALWAYS be the big dominant one. 
Look how they are rolling out bitcoin atms everywhere. And all exchanges are BTC/(insert shitcoin here). 
It's just like the US dollar (in these terms). 
First or most dominate like the usd, and everything gets compared to and worked according to it btc. 
Yes in the future there will be better and more useful coins. 
But it's easiest/needed to have BTC first to change to it. 
The more bitcoin spread out around the world AND the more hodlers, it will stay strong.

My honest view/opinion.....
I really don't care at all about it. I'll be long gone by the time it matters. Me and the wife are never having kids, so there goes the "your children" defense too. 
1 person can't make a difference. I live in Asia, you should see the pollution and everything here. Even with USA making (even more) laws to control their people more/trying to fix climate change, they are tiny in the world map. It does pretty much nothing. All the countries here don't give a fuck about it, and the USA putting shit on cars to reduce pollution doesn't help at all. 
Especially me, 1 person, worrying about it or devoting my life to it, won't do fuck all. 
If I do everything I can in my life and live the best I can to slow it down, the best outcome is that 1 ant on the whole world might live 1 second longer for my life's work.

You just tried to pick every sentence apart because you have no defense to anything I said, so you take it all and try to twist it back to me negatively. 
Nice try bud. 
It just proves you have nothing you can compare to bitcoin to make an argument, thus...... you lose.

Or let me guess, you dodge this too and try to act all high and mighty. 
Keep twisting shit turn it turns right for you. 
Pathetic.

From the peanuts it's currently worth!
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:18:02
Wow that's a stretch buddy. 
You better be vegetarian and make your own clothes and live outdoors if you claim to be so high and mighty and are not contributing to climate change. 
Plus, have you ever been up north? It's freezing up there. Climate change is nice. Extra few days on summer. HELL YA!

I thought you loved bad boys ��
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:50:13
Exactly. No one would of lasted til $3000 or $5000/BTC to make their millions. 
Me included. That's why I don't bitch about it like others. $1000/BTC. Who could resist then?
Balls of steal to hold out past $2000/coin

What you mean consider the possibility?
It will shit the bed the same as bitcoin crash. 
Everyone will have a hard dick for a week or 2 thinking 2x is the best shit. Then it will have a slow painful death (see bch chart for exact comparison)
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:31:09
He's probably got a tiny dick anyways. 
It would be like eating a tic tac. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:40:34
No worries. That's for the interesting read
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:08:54
Ya and some people think mining rigs are a major cause of global warming........
I'll be dead by the time global warming matters anyway. It's the next generations problem. We have had to deal with problems from our forefathers, why break the chain now
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:56:43
You gotta do what you feel is best. Don't listen to any one.  I'm not giving any advice. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:35:39
Exactly. So why everyone still feel the need to "moon"
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:08:13
Agreed. He means nothing here. 
Bitcoin is to escape from idiots like him. 
He has no power here. We are just giving him publicity that he is desperately seeking. 
NEW RULE suggestion. 
Whenever you see a post about that guy, downvote it. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:55:01
Still feel good after this big drop today? ��
Kidding it will go back up soon
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:42:23
Lol you got nothing you can compare it to. 
You got owned. 
Running your mouth like your so smart and knowledgeable, but then got stfu really quick when asked for examples of your nonsense. 
Everyone can see you have no leg to stand on. 
Go hide and cry in the corner now. Mommy will come tell you it will be ok. 
Next time, don't run your mouth unless prepared to back it up. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:03:01
Totally. Worth it
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:08:46
Ya. But remember there's TONS of lost/unrecoverable bitcoins. Lots
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:43:11
Exactly. I only get 1 life. I'm not gunna live it worried about what happens when I die.

Ya you better hurry cuz bitcoin cash won't be worth anything soon ;)
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:22:05
And there's the dip........

Op is a troll. Selective replies. REPLY TO THIS OP.... (from another user):
Sorry, this post sounds extremely fake.
Unless you have a wallet.dat you don't have any bitcoins. I don't know how you could have extracted any private keys out of a wallet back in September 2009. Tools to do so did not exist. I don't know what is in your excel sheet but it doesn't sound like anything bitcoin related (certainly not from 2009).
I tried to access the wallets but only had the wallet.dat files and could not find passwords to decrypt the wallet.
There was no wallet encryption until 2011
In another comment you mention mining on Slush's pool which did not exist until very late 2010 in the days of GPU mining. Your story does not add up at all... there have been several fake "I'm bitcoin rich!/I found old bitcoins!" posts lately (that get lots of upvotes) and yours sounds like one.
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:14:26
Add another 10 seconds to the end. 
The "get bitcoin" didn't burn into people's brains yet
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:00:17
Everyone who's ever had, or heard of, bitcoin regrets this. 
It's getting old hearing it.

@_date: 2017-10-18 15:21:04
No way. 
Just cuz 1 exchange closes people don't decide not to have/use/hold bitcoin. 
What a stupid assumption.

Lets talk about amateur hour. You posted this not long ago:
Selling Question
Hi everyone,
I looked through the FAQ first but it didn't really answer my question. I'm new to crypto currency and have some bitcoin and lite coin. While I don't really plan on selling much, I'd like to occasionally sell. What is the best way to sell online for a total newbie? I purchased my coins on coinbase but have since transferred them to other wallets not online. Would I need to send them back to coinbase to sell, and are there more fees associated with this? I already had to pay a fairly high buyers fee and transfer fee on coinbase. Thank you so much for the replies.
Who's amateur hour now?
LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!
