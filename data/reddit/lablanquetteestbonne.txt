It's not much. 
Really, it's economics. Being excited about Bitcoin doesn't mean you can just ignore known economics aspects. If you want more explanations and knowledgeable opinions, go ask on @_date: 2013-03-19 07:17:14
Simple, they increase the price.

Stop being so aggressive just because he doesn't agree with you.
And don't put your whole comment in bold. That doesn't help at all.
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:06:39
Ok, let's take some examples.
How do you ensure that everyone driving a car has a sufficient level at driving?
How do you makes sure no-one gets mugged?
How do you replace the justice system?
How do you make sure all the airplanes flying in the country have a sufficient level of safety?
How do you go to war?
How do you make sure poor people do not just die silently without a chance to get back on their feet?
How do you put incentives in using public transportation?
How do you make sure one can't make money by destroying the environment?

Err... Merchants have to pay VAT on bitcoin sale. It doesn't make sense if they don't. It's tax evasion. 
You still have to pay it if you use cash. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 21:57:16


First, they do have control over it; they choose to live in an area with such taxes. Plus, obviously they have to pay since they use the services that are provided thanks to those taxes.


That's different. The taxes for habitation should reflect the cost of the services that you receive by living there. There's no reason to factor in your situation.
Now, your situation is factored in the benefits you get. So such a difficult situation would get lots of benefits, making the delta (taxes - benefits) much more bearable.
What's important is that delta. Separating the calculation of it in several taxes makes it easier to justify each of those and estimate them, based on what they're supposed to pay for.

1, 2 and 3: So you have no solution.


I work in aviation and I can tell you that you're completely wrong. And you can't expect all passengers to research and understand the safety of an aircraft. I'm an aerospace engineer and I wouldn't be able to ensure it myself.
5 So you leave in a peace and love world where all security is totally ensured by everyone carrying a gun. Aircrafts, ships, missiles or radars are worthless too apparently.
6 I'm not religious. So you rely on begging as a cover for poor people.
7 It's widely accepted that encouraging the use of public transportation is beneficial for society as a whole. So you have no solution.
8 So you kill the ones who do that? Who would do so? And without trial of course, since you got rid of that too.
You're hilarious.
@_date: 2013-02-16 18:38:35
So you want tips too. I wish people would stop giving tips to posts like this. There are multiple a day now. People just post for the free money. 
@_date: 2013-02-17 21:26:27
per month.

You don't know why I got BTC.
@_date: 2013-02-26 18:32:05
What if you like what the middleman does to the product?
@_date: 2013-03-07 20:17:22
That requires trust with their funds, and more importantly a SatoshiDice account.
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:02:41


Me too.


No they couldn't.
Look, there are two ways:
* Either you consider Bitcoin as money. Therefore you don't tax conversions between BTC and $ (since it's just a currency change), and you tax when you buy something in BTC.
* Either you consider Bitcoin as a good (not a currency). In that case, buying BTC would be taxed like a stock; which is that you tax the profit you make by buying low and selling high; there's no sale tax because you don't buy to a company, you buy to another person on a market (like when you buy something second hand). Now, buying something with BTC would be barter (you exchange a good for a good). But barter is taxed exactly like a transaction with money. You'd have to estimate the transaction in $ and pay your taxes.
So in both cases it's the same. Buying things with Bitcoin has to be taxed the same way as anything else.
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:17:36
They're not very welcome actually. Comments criticizing Bitcoin or even just criticizing an extreme libertarian political system (almost anarchism) will get buried. Even with polite arguments and sources.
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:28:53
And some people still say that this sub is about discussion and not a circlejerk…
@_date: 2013-03-09 23:25:32
Its value went up by 300% in the last 2 months. No stock beats that.
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:35:11
You guys certainly forget to mention that Bitcoin's philosophy favours anarchism when promoting it, don't you?
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:37:46


A black market where you can go without getting mugged, by using public infrastructure, in your regulated car, with your state-issued driver license, and where you use federal money that you took at your regulated bank?
Try to go to a black market in Somalia and see if it's really a haven of free-market prosperity.


See my other comment. [Here](
@_date: 2013-02-16 15:28:12
Oh, another guy coming for tips.
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:44:47
You're right, it's quite educational, but very one-sided politically and quite limited. We actually don't learn much about many aspects of economy by taking an interest in Bitcoin. It's just a great introduction to currency and markets.
I'd recommend picking out some simple books about economics and markets if you wish to actually learn about it.
I've decided to learn about it myself, so I did a bit of research about good accessible books. [I recommend this one]( as a start, but there are many others (the only complain I have is that it's a bit US-focused in some parts, but it's easy to apply elsewhere too).
@_date: 2013-03-08 20:17:21
Sorry, I forgot that only good things can be said about BTC here.
Nevermind. Bitcoin are great and answer the world's problems.
EDIT: And if you want a real answer, I follow what happens to BTC for one simple reason. Because their price goes up quite a lot. And it's the same reason as most other people who get BTCs.
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:40:25
The vast majority of economics professors or books.
See my other comment. [Here](
@_date: 2013-03-08 20:05:02
Cash have other uses. The only reason a teen would currently want BTC is for drugs.
@_date: 2013-02-15 13:17:13
In most cases it actually means "bitcoin allow for easier tax evasion". 
EDIT: In my mind, it's was a bad thing. Apparently not for everyone…
It's funny to see some people criticize the Greeks one day for not paying their taxes, and say that it's awesome when they do it the next day.
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:31:59
There are two sides to the arguments; many libertarians agree that a government and regulations make business possible. Actually, it tends to be the majority.
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:30:07
Barter is subjected to VAT. 
So even if you don't consider Bitcoin as money but as "an object" that you exchange for goods, it doesn't matter. VAT applies.
@_date: 2013-03-24 13:53:44
They said that for Ireland, then Portugal, then Greece, then Italy... 
@_date: 2013-03-10 14:29:38


And there's the problem with a deflationary currency. No spending, no investment.
@_date: 2013-03-23 13:25:34
You should open a simple economics book. The reason why you're able to run a business is because of the government, its regulations, and the taxes we pay. You actually robs society now, not the other way around. 
Also, on your taxes it doesn't matter if you use Bitcoin or dollars. You have to pay the same taxes. If you don't declare it, it's tax evasion and is pretty harshly punished (as it should). 
@_date: 2013-02-14 21:26:33
Same thing. I just got a wallet, but I'm still hesitant to actually put money into this, especially when I see the volatility.
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:28:20
No, it's only for accidental losses.
@_date: 2013-03-17 11:54:04
Maybe at the time it was put in place there might have been some protests, but nothing really incredible. But now it's been there for a long time, and although some parties want to ditch it, there's no "revolt". 
@_date: 2013-03-08 20:08:18
Hopefully, the non-disclosure of the software isn't what they rely on for protection.
@_date: 2013-02-16 18:49:53
Yes, sorry for the tone. I was just fed up with that. It's literally several times a day now.
Plus, with this frequency, I'm really suspecting some of the OPs to not be beginners but just faking it to get tips. I don't know for that particular case of course, I hope OP won't take it personally.
@_date: 2013-03-08 19:51:45
That's great. So they'll learn earlier how to buy drugs.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:38:52
You need to stop putting so many words in bold. It really makes it more difficult to read.
@_date: 2013-05-07 21:49:39
You have the choice to take it or not. The price is fixed. Your choice.
You pay a revenue taxes because you chose to earn revenue at that price for example.
@_date: 2013-03-05 20:27:46
It's similar to betting on a startup that worked. It's rare, risky, but it happens.
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:14:54
Because the US is the way it is now because it had a functioning government for centuries.
@_date: 2013-03-16 18:11:43
Me neither. But I didn't say I disapprove that tax, I just said it exists. Honestly I'm not sure what to think of it. 
@_date: 2013-03-16 13:06:50
There's a wealth tax in France. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:48:30
Yes, thanks. I'm not a native speaker.
@_date: 2013-02-16 11:07:21
These are not commercial transactions, they are mostly speculation. People mostly use Bitcoin to try to make money, not to buy things.
Just look at the comments here when someone say that it's volatile. People say that it's awesome because it's "easy money". For most people, Bitcoin isn't a currency, it's a stock.
Not that there's anything wrong with that though.
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:25:32
Who's the asshole depends on who you ask.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:34:05
I had the same problem with Bitcoin Central. Normally it takes 1 day, but they had a security problem and went offline for a whole week.
Oh well. Still bought some.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:48:41
That's an oxymoron.
@_date: 2013-05-08 08:30:24
What you do is like eating in a restaurant and then complaining about the price. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:35:18


He didn't say that any government is good. He said that no government makes business impossible (or at least extremely difficult).


You can't put yourself in the US and imagine it without a government. Do the same exercise but put yourself in Nigeria or Somalia, and you'll have a more realistic view. Can you still do the same thing now?
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:36:32
His point is that doing nothing would be worse, since all customers would lose all funds and the country would lose all its banks.
@_date: 2013-03-16 15:48:51
The former because it's a deflationary currency (so known effects of discouraging investment, destroying growth and limiting economic activity), and the latter because it encourages tax evasion (obviously bad for society in general).
@_date: 2013-03-02 21:57:15
Most people conveniently do not report anything, as long as they can get away easily with it.
They will tell you that they are against taxes, that the government shouldn't get their money, that it's freedom… but in the end they just like not paying and getting free things.
It's kinda illegal and immoral, but hey, money.
Note: I think it's bad, to be clear. I haven't declared anything, but I've made a grand total of 6€ by trying out bitcoin so it's not really a big deal.
@_date: 2013-02-26 20:21:38
It's like saying that stocks users are not affected. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:14:30
Yes. He takes advantages of the fact that we're at peace, that we have an infrastructure to support the economy, that we have a monetary system that allows to trade globally reliably, that people are educated enough to earn money to buy his things, that we have public services, that we have research so that OP isn't dead of a random decease at age 5, that we have laws and regulations to prevent unfair competition, that he or his customer won't be mugged by coming to his shop, that the postal service can deliver mail reliably, that airplanes do not crash every two flights, that we have the internet that works well and allows for secure business…
Example from "Naked economics" by Wheelan (good book BTW):








@_date: 2013-03-05 20:26:38
So what? That's what is supposed to happen in a healthy market when many people are thinking of "cashing out".
@_date: 2013-03-16 13:08:14
However, it's very risky. Also, the massive use of Bitcoin would be very bad for the economy and society. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:16:16
It's pretty simple: go to any discussion thread here, look at the most downvoted comments, and you'll find good level-headed arguments against the use of Bitcoin as a currency or against Austrian economics. 
@_date: 2013-03-17 19:16:33
The tax increase you're talking about isn't the same as the wealth tax.
