Too far too fast this last week in my opinion.  We better hope the whales do not start dumping.  I am also worried about the shorts licking their chops when BTC goes live on the CME futures exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:01:21
Whenever anyone asks how much bitcoin I have, I tell them “not enough”.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:02:16
This is very useful!  Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:50:53
My sentiment as well.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:54:23
Make sure PriceBitcoinForTrans is the price of a FULL bitcoin plus the fees you paid.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:46:56
I was thinking the exact same thing.  I decided not to send my bitcoin to Coinbase,   I have all of my bitcoin in my Trezor, and I have decided to wait for Trezor to come out with a software solution for the Segwit 2x fork.
Also,I would not do anything with my bitcoin until there is some clear instructions on how to safely and simply work around possible replay attacks.  Once those solutions are in place, I will claim my B2x coins, move them to Coinbase and dump them.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:24:48
That is what I do as far as selling.  I do not keep my coins on Coinbase after a purchase though.  I immediately move them to my Trezor hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:02:05
Good deal.

I used Changelly to Exchange my BCH for BTC.  Worked great.

They can mine all they would like.  Unless they have consensus from a majority of the validating nodes the blocks would be rejected and never be added to the blockchain.

Must be nice to have such amazing psychic powers...lol

No.  I am not interested in liquidating any asset that has appreciated around 1000% in a year.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:11:15
I will have to look into that.  I rarely sell so it is not an issue for me.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:26:05
I am a huge fan of bitcoin and I agree we will get there.  I disagree with your premise that there is only room for one crypto currency.  I think they have  unique use cases.  I also think atomic swaps will be very beneficial for crypto holder.
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:55:36
Many wallets have been very slow to adopt Segwit, and that is why there is only 12% of new transactions in Segwit format (most Segwit addresses start with a 3)
Here is a link with a list of wallets that currently support Segwit or are in the process of supporting Segwit in the near future.  I am not sure how current this list is:

I usually have to wait 4 to 5 business days for the money to appear in my bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:49:26
These short term predictions are hilarious.  We are up 630% YTD.  I think we need to take a breath and curb our collective enthusiasm.  These are the same people that will declare BTC dead the next time it drops 20%.  
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:49:27
So I can buy some bitcoin.

I have accumulated BTC since 2013.  I do not believe in putting all of my eggs in one basket so I also own Litecoin and Ethereum.  I diversified my crypto portfolio as follows:
60% BTC, 20% Litecoin and 20% Ethereum.  I believe that BTC will have fantastic upside  over the next several years, but I also believe that Litecoin and Ethereum have bright futures.  I also believe that each of these cryptos have their own distinct use cases:
1)  Bitcoin is, for me at least, a store of value 
2)  Litecoin is a deflationary currency to be used for transactional purposes
3)  Eihereum is a token that allows one to own a share of the world’s largest distributed system 
These use cases may change over time (for example BTC may become a great transactional system once LN is deployed and widely adopted).
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:56:25
You can try and day trade BTC, but I suspect you will discover that buying and holding is a far better strategy. Either you believe it is a worthwhile investment/asset class or you do not. If you do not believe it is a worthwhile investment/asset class, run, do not walk to the nearest exit.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:04:15
This article does a decent job explaining Transaction Malleability 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:48:56
You are clearly a bitcoin maximalist.  That is fine.  I also remember when everyone thought AOL WAS the Internet to use your analogy.  Only time will tell how all of this pans out.  I hope you are right because I have a sizable holding in BTC.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:56:18
Yes.  If these layer2 solutions pan out for BTC I agree that it will become a great transactional crypto.  I do not think anyone can deny the fact that fees are currently way too high and the time it takes to confirm transactions is way too slow.  Also, I believe that if it continues to soar in price (i.e. be hyper-deflationary) why would anyone in their right mind want to spend it??  I am not going to be the guy who buys a several thousand dollar pizza.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:47:19
Fees will crush you buying that way.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:37:55
Wait.  There is huge backlog since BCH crowd is spamming the BTC mempool with micro-transactions 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:31:21
Basically Bitcoin would need blocksizes measured in GBs (perhaps TBs) in order to scale and be competitive with the likes of MasterCard and Visa.  I run a full node with port 8333 open to take inbound requests (I am running a full, validating node).  
My ISP allows me 1 Terabtye of through-put a month.  This means that I could run my node for about 1 day before reaching this limit.  There are are thousands of people, like me, volunteering their resources to make Bitcoin secure and de-centralized by running these nodes.   Simply increasing the block size does not seem to be a valid long term solution.  The better long term solution would be layer2 solutions using sidechains (i.e .Lightning Network) for transacting and allowing settlement to occur in the primary blockchain.
If you have no problem with huge block sizes that require centralized nodes running in corporate data centers, then the big block solution is the way to go. If that is the endgame, I will sell my BTC and use PayPal and Venmo.  BTC would just turn into another centralized financial platform in which to transact,

I personally found his comments on child pornography repugnant, but I do not believe that will impact Ethereum one way or the other.  I am more concerned  about the wallet bug that locked up $150 million of ether.  My major concern with ETH is that it is written in a full turing language and has a dramatically larger attack surface than many other cryptos.  With that said, they do have a very flexible Network and they are backed by some huge companies.
All of these cryptos are still in their infancy.  Most will fail but there is room for the top five or six to thrive....IMO

@_date: 2017-11-10 04:32:10
Hilarious 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:29:50
 By “segregating” the digital signature from each transaction, more transactions can be put into a single block.  This will provide greater throughput on the BTC Network and result in blocks with more transactions.
Also resolves the transaction malleability issue that occurs when the signature is stored with the transaction.  Google it for a more in-depth description.
Edit:  to add malleability 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:29:10
Read the first comment on this link.  I think it makes a very good case for Litecoin
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:49:19
Yeah let’s bring politics into the discussion...stupid.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:55:03
Sounds like an ill-advised decision.  Bitcoin is a very volatile and risky investment.  You should only invest what you can comfortably afford to lose.  I love your enthusiasm, but I think it is a very risky bet.

It means it is Work In Progress (not completed but being worked in)

Usually there is a around a 5 business day wait between the time you sell and the time the money appears in your bank account.  The sale price is locked in at the time of the sale.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:27:47
I am not sure what each of your columns really mean so I will explain using my own terminology:
TotBitcoin = Total quantity owned (in terms of bitcoin)
NumBitcoinForTrans =Bitcoin quantity for transaction
PriceBitcoinForTrans = Cost for transaction including Fees
Weighted Average Cost:
Summation of the following for each transaction:
(NumBitcoinForTrans/TotBitcoin) x PriceBitcoinForTrans
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:38:25
Or use LIFO for your cost basis if you were an early investor.

@_date: 2017-09-25 14:15:25
How do you decide the cost basis of the sale.  FIFO (First In First Out), LIFO (Last In First Out) or Weighted Dollar Cost Average?  It matters because the strategy used can vastly affect your Profit/Loss and the taxes you pay.
@_date: 2017-09-24 04:42:28
Thanks for sharing.  This was an excellent and eye-opening talk.  I would love to see a conversation between the gentleman in this video, Andreas Antonopoulos and Vitalik Buterin.  Would be a fantastic forum!
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:04:54
Bitcoin Fees are independent of the amount sent.  They are priced per byte of the transaction size.

You can buy your bitcoin on Coinbase.  Once you have the bitcoin in your Coinbase Wallet (note: this can take from a few days to a week for the sale to settle), you can send the bitcoins to your Trezor Wallet from Coinbase.
I would recommend that you initially send just a small amount as a test to make sure you understand what you are doing.  
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:51:26
For people into technical analysis, it is a bullish signal if the price breaks above the inverted neckline.
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:51:36
In Coinbase there is an option to Send Bitcoin.  I bring up Coinbase on my mobile phone, bring up my Trezor Wallet in my PC, and then scan the QR Code from my Trezor Wallet for “TO” address in Coinbase Wallet.  
In simple terms, you are sending Bitcoin from you Coinbase Wallet to your Trezor Wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:02:17
You are fine.  No problem.  The secret is you always want to control your private keys.  When your crypto is on an Exchange like Coinbase, they control the private keys.  But using Coinbase as an intermediary to buy your bitcoin is not an issue.  Once the bitcoin is there just send it to your Trezor as described above.
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:17:30
Yes that is what I do.  I transfer the bitcoin to my Coinbase 
wallet.  Then sell it from my Coinbase wallet.  I believe the proceeds then sit in your USD account on Coinbase.  I will let others explain how it gets to your bank account.  I have not sold any bitcoin recently.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:00:30
One of the biggest shareholders in Citi-Bank is bad mouthing Bitcoin.  Who would have thunk it...lol.
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:46:21
Nope.  Remember it is the "Wallstreet" Journal.  The banksters business rag.
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:33:10
Correct.  In fact, Trezor never exposes the actual private key to you.  If you ever lose your Trezor, you can get another one and enter the reovery seed and you will once again have access to your bitcoin.
The same recovery seed will work on other wallets as well (not sure which other ones exactly).
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:42:02
The fact that you gave ordered a hard wallet before buying your bitcoin tells me you are on the ball.  You will have no problem with any of  this.
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:36:23
Google it.  It is  shameless scam.
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:17:40
Correct.  The private keys are derived from your Trezor’s Seed Phrase (which you should keep in a secure place and never share with anyone).   When you set up your Trezor this will make more sense to you.
Also, bitcoin is never really “stored” in a wallet.  The bitcoin you own are unspent transactions sent to your public address on the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:53:13
As I mentioned earlier, i initially send .00001 bitcoin as a test to make sure you got the hang of it.  Then you can send the rest.
