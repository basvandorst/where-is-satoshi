As someone who just started to research bitcoin a few hours ago, and I do not mean any disrespect by this cause I’ll be joining y’all in hodling soon, this whole thing seems like a never ending game of black jack. 
Put $500 on the table and watch it go up and down, maybe you’ll lose it all, maybe you’ll strike it rich.

Thanks for the advice! I’m ready to just sit back and absorb everything I can!

Oh of course, no way I’d just dump an ton of money into something cause the news talks about it. Im gonna watch the market for a week or two and drop a couple hundred bucks in. If it hits 0 I lost a few hundred bucks, if it doesn’t, then great

Heard about all this jazz a couple years ago. I’m looking to get into it as I recently came across a decent sized inheritance. Do you think $250 is a decent amount to start, and if so when do you think the best time to buy would be?

My dad was a pretty big card player back in the day so I’m well aware that a $1,000 investment might as well be a $1,000 purchase. Just gotta HODL (am I doing this right?)

Gotta start somewhere right?

As an outsider this seems to me like an important point a lot of people don’t consider. All these different cryptos shot up, gained some attention, and now they’re on the decline. If the dream of bitcoin or whatever other crypto becoming used like legitimate currency and therefore being valued through the roof unfolds, then it doesn’t seem like all the different currencies will jump. People will likely gravitate to one crypto that rises in price and dominates all the others
