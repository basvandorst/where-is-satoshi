Done. Thank you :)

Yes we have the exploit details. Ignoring the "secure" comment earlier (which has now been removed) we chose an open source system as we're strong supporters of that framework. Thanks for the heads up though.

Yes the system is converting AUD to BTC as the actual cards are purchased in AUD and issued from here. We have had queries regarding international cards in other currencies, and this is something that will be investigated shortly.

Read our earlier posts. We created this account to launch the website.

It doesnt surprise me that a user registered today to post a comment. Anyone can follow reddit, you only need an account to post.

The payment address is dynamically generated, and users are free to generate a new sender address each time they order. Guest registration is enabled, and all that is needed is a postage address (no ID is necessary with Express Post). The merchant system is tied to the shipping system by an order ID only, and if the merchant system is compromised and the transactions are reversed, the and the cutomer DB compromised all it would show is gift cards being purchased with BTC and postage address. Remember, you are allowed to buy gift cards. There's nothing wrong with that. Its anonymous in the sense that no personal information is ever required. Users have the option of entering or not entering any personal info to the site.

Yeah, dumb statement. Subsequently removed...

You do realise bitcoin is open source? We dont need to debate the security of open source vs proprietary, but we chose open source and are happy to stick with it. Thanks.

Hi everyone. Thanks for the comments. We would like to address the concerns up front:
The checkout functionality is hosted by BitPay and we are a registered merchant. The transaction is completed under SSL by them to an address that they dynamically genererate.
The site is  designed to be anonymous on purpose. We want to protect our interests as much as you yours with all the attention Bitcoin is getting from governments now.  
We have been longterm users of reddit, but created an account to launch the business.
Regarding visa prepaid cards, thanks for the suggestion. We are currently investigating this.
A lot of effort has gone into the site which you can clearly see. Its not a $2 bitcoin shop.
Postage is conducted via Australia Post Express Post - this issues a tracking number but does not require ID. As each order uses a unique adress, its simply a posted item arriving in the mail.
Regarding SSL, we are curently investigating running the whole site under SSL, not just the checkout.
Feedback is always welcomed and encouraged. We are an honest startup and would appreciate all the positive support we can get. You're welcome to test site and the BitPay checkout functionality (without sending through any bitcoin).

Transactions arent processed or stored on the Bit-Cards server, it simply stores order ID, items and postage details. Transaction details are stored by the Merchant, which has the order ID, but no item/postage/user details. The transaction details are also dynamically generated. Hence the decision was made to not encrypt the cart system and run SSL on the checkout/payment gateway only.
In addition, no bitcoins or wallets are stored anywhere on the system. Logging in as a guest or registering an account doesnt give the site access to your wallet to move funds around - the funds need to be sent separately by you, completely outside the website (manually, using the QR code or URI). Place a dummy order and test for yourself... From our point of view the payment address will expire (15 mins) and the order will be cleared from the system.
Having said all that, as people are asking for SSL on the entire site (not just the transactional system) its something we will be setting up soon.

The ATO has advised a limit of AUD $2000 per transaction.

Thanks for the pen test. Please try again and let me know how you go.
