Mining will become increasingly difficult.

As transactions volume increase by usage the demand for new blocks will increase steadily and the demand for mining will increase steadily therefor the difficulty will almost certainly never decrease over a significant amount of time. Instead due to incentivication system it will steadily increase regardless of current bitcoin price. So if difficulty steadily increases as we have seen historically there will come a point in time at which mining and storing new transactions will be expensive. But my question is rather what happens to bitcoin transactions if there are no more blocks to mine and store them on anymore. As I understood the ledger is limited to the numbet of blocks being mined. How many blocks remain and how many transaction can be stored mathematically on the blocks unmined? As I see it there is a mathematical limit of transactions the ledger can store. When will the ledget be "full" and what happens when it gets full? Will it become impossible to send bitcoins to other wallets? Will wealth redistributed by wallet exchanges instead of transactions? I know that lightning wants to offload transactions off the blockchain but the core technology still remains unchanged. As I understood it you need new blocks to store new transaction records. I just dont know how it works when all blocks are mined. 
Has anyone calculated the blocks left to be mined?
