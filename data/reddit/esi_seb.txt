Yes this seems correct. Kind of how Revolut works right now as well.

There is mention here

It's a Lithuanian startup, they work close with a bank and you actually get a Lithuanian IBAN coupled with it.

All merchants who use Bitpay need to be made aware and be replaced by a competitive product asap, that would be very good for Bitcoin.
It's really sad because Bitpay did so much for the industry a couple of years ago, they really dropped the ball in a major way at some point, maybe the founders got so rich they just didnt care anymore, who knows.

Found it [
Looks a lot less exciting I must say. 
Of course centralized companies like Coinbase who have a huge % of marketshare with their wallet, its hard to say how that would influence the chart.  
These guys must have amazing inside info though on the real usage of Bitcoin.

Is there a similar chart about the cumulative BTC value of transactions per block instead of # transactions?

It's also curious that today of all days Bovada launched their BCH implementation. 
Bovada being owned by Calvin Ayre, who met with Roger Ver in october.
Roger Ver could easily have orchestrated a lot of positive signals like these to influence a pump

Well I feel I more or less just watched the movie already

Is the best thing you can do for Bitcoin, next to buying Bitcoin, to move your Bitcoin off exchanges?

This is a guy that goes out of his way to appear super smart.

Which is a very common use case for many, it's not like that service shouldn't exist.
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:52:16
I appreciate and applaud your venture blockonomics, so thats why I will be honest assessing your service. 
- Your site looks like shit, sorry I wouldnt trust you / your service by looking at your site. Site design and branding should be an easy fix in todays age. Your movie makes me crinch and is unprofessional. I know you guys are probably the good guys and you mean well, but as a customer all I get is an amateur vibe.
- I have to say I trust a .co initially less than a similar company with a .com, get a better domain name.

I think for the majority of folks, this should be OK.

I'm not the target audience, bluewallet does not show up when you type Bitcoin and from what I can see it can do very little things except store Bitcoin. There are several HD Bitcoin wallets, but few that integrate FIAT.

How long before hosted services like Blockchain, Coinbase, Kraken, ... support lightning?

Is BitWorth safe? Anyone?
