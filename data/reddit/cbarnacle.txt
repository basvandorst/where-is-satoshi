Took about 2 weeks to get to Australia - and the guy added extras as well! Great stuff.

Calm down mate
@_date: 2014-02-18 11:54:30
Agreed - also very clever
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:08:18
Oh no you don't - stay away from my goat!

Get some paper and then you can write things with it - but not pink paper as you won't be able to see it.

Don't panic. I got it a few weeks back, the transactions remained unconfirmed and then disappeared after a few days.
It's a form of spam that is called 'dust'. 
Plenty of threads recently about it that can explain it better than me. A search for 'dust' should do it.

Agreed - really feel safe and secure using the Armory offline method. Definitely sleep better at night now!

Where can I obtain one of these 'hardcore asshats' you speak of? Sounds quite spiffy!

Looks like Step 2 has been solved - and the answer is Bitcoin!

How's the business going OP? How many transactions have you done? Would live to visit your store but it's a bit far from Australia!

Great stuff mate. Know that it's appreciated amongst many here in Australia.

Not sure mate. 
However I read somewhere that a theory as to why they exist as spam is that they could be used to 'track' transactions somehow to maybe identify and link various wallets and addresses as owned by the same person.
Why someone would want to do this I'm not sure - but I suggest a little more research may be in order as I'm still learning about all this as well and don't want to steer you in the wrong direction - or cause unnecessary worry.

Interesting article. 
Could the key be where a Walmart customer exchanges their fiat into BTC at exchange terminals /kiosks as they enter (but instead of being called Bitcoins they are called 'Walmart wonder discount vouchers' or something similar) then use them to purchase goods at a discount to the usual prices because it costs Walmart less on transaction fees?
You could do all this for the aforementioned 'typical' Walmart shopper without them ever having heard about BTC.
