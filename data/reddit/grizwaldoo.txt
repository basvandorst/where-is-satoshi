ugh... To the VPN then, although i feel i should boycott the store till they bring it back, not that id get anything out of that. its a shame i have to do it the somewhat dodgy way when ive been doing it totally legit till now. 
for those interested vpn works

it does but only in the US now, they ripped the option in the UK definitely, and possibly the whole of the EU too, it still works if you access via vpn though.
there was also steambits.com, but that doesnt load anymore
there also used to be coingas.com, but thats closed with the message "bitcoin is in free fall we will be back after it settles" 
then finally you have steamloader.com who sell steam gift cards in $50 or $100 for BTC, they used to do other smaller ones too but they cant seem to get hold of them at the mo, ive used it many times though and the service is always spot on
im always looking for more too
oh crap just noticed that the op wanted a console part not digital games bitcoinstore.com have some pads and stuff but ive never used them so i cant vouch for them

i know they didnt keep the btc but most places that accept these days do so via bitpay and the like that doesnt mean i still dont prefer to buy there, i like the fact that my gaming machine can pay for my games and am a little annoyed that yet again we in the EU have been ignored, they could very easily have implemented bitpay which works all over
stranger still it seems theyre still more than happy to let you buy the bundle in BTC just not things from the store. honestly i bought PA there mainly because steamloader would have left me with leftover cash as they only had $50 cards at the moment if they had $14 and $20 cards id probably have just gone down that road.
in honesty unless they have something really special on offer then ill probably steer clear of them until they get in gear and get a bitpay account setup
