Firstly, how long did you wait for the response? If not less than a week then it's normal you wouldn't get it.
I sent a question to them and they responded after 2 weeks, but it was a simple question.
They get over 25 000 new registrants **a week** as their recent blog post, so you might take a while to solve. Keep calm. I had no issues with them myself. Every exchange is dealing with shitty withdrawal issues and heavy traffic because of crypto popularity booming.

The moment everyone realizes this is when everyone starts thinking and investing money rationally.
People are not saying that Bitcoin compared to *Bitcoin Cash* is bad and that *Bitcoin Cash* is the future, but that **right now** *Bitcoin Cash* is more functional. 
If you buy *Bitcoin Cash* that doesn't mean you support Roger Ver. Roger Ver is some guy that claims he is the savior of the coin or something, but imagine a situation that he died, would anything change? No the coin is coded and the code stays. Roger Ver has no influence over the cryptocurrency itself, only the publicity of it, which then has influence on price.
Would i want *Bitcoin Cash* to succeed? Maybe not, there is a lot of manipulation and it is a bad influence on all cryptos, but switching from Bitcoin to *Bitcoin Cash* is not irrational, because **at the current moment** it does its job better **as a currency or a means of exchange**.
If Bitcoin would fix its issues with fees, then i believe everyone will be more confident and leave *Bitcoin Cash*.

This is nothing compared to Forex though. That's probably *only* insider info, because the rich people move those markets and you don't know anything about when or to which way it will happen.

Why was their stop below the previous high in 2013? How is that exactly a good expectancy? It would have to be the previous high PLUS and additional amount if you are safe.
The price was to be expected to reach near the 1160 even if were to go down, yet they went short and put their stop at that point?
I haven't traded so long, but this is just bs. I don't understand their choice?

As much as i know i have no tell into this, but sounds like her situation is pretty rough. You can't blame her cause she just didn't know better. 
You are already in a better spot so why do you even need to make it harder for the other person. Some people just want to reach out for help. 
You are basically kicking the poor at this point and really what better are you than the rich people that don't care about the average Joe?
If that would be how you would play it, then it would only harm your reputation an integrity. You are already in a better spot, so why are you bothered still by small little problems. The only thing this does is shows your insecurities. 
But we can do better than that! Bitcoin is a chance for us to be thankful for the opportunity given to us to rise higher. We can use it for self-validation and pleasure or we can help create a better future.
This is yet i see too many posts like this and i don't know why i am posting this.

That's the problem, you can't. I have written about this issue several times on reddit about how decentralization/anonymity is a problem when you actually try to cash out your crypto.
You simply can not prove to the IRS (or any other tax service in your country) that you got the *money* (crypto) by justified and legal means. For all they know you could have gotten that money for drug selling.
The only argument is that it is an exchange and you can't actually give money to someone *in particular*. But as manipulation happens in crypto and on decentralized exchanges, the government won't let this pass easily.
Privacy is just a circle-jerk at this point. If we want crypto to be globally adopted we may need some sort of KYC support for it, because your *privacy* will only make your money be taken by the IRS, cause guess what you can't prove it is yours. 
Exchanges like Coinbase, Bitfinex, Kraken do keep a history of the trades you issued, with your ID attached to your account, so that isn't hard to tell the IRS how you got the money. 
It would be *really* nice if people understood this and didn't shout *privacy!* at every crypto, like it solves problems when in reality it may create problems, especially for companies that want to adopt it. For person to person transactions? Sure you can do that privately that might not bother too much if your cashflow isn't $50k a day.

Personally i have bought Bitcoins to just HODL, but also cryptotrade. The 40% loss really depends on your trading strategy.
The safest approach is trading on 15 minute charts where you get small gains, but you get them all day long, which takes more time but is safer. Even if price dips to 0, you don't care about that cause you aren't a long term trader so you don't participate in such swings.
If you are a day trader then sure you can lose this money, but believe me, trading Forex you get fucked over so much that you get a good discipline over how to deal with these situations already. They aren't new to good traders. 
That's where risk management comes into place. And there are things such as trailing stop losses or moving stop losses to break even, which help manage so things like this don't happen.
@_date: 2017-09-30 10:15:14
I think it would be more clear, that the amount of *money you are okay to lose*, is the amount that doesn't affect you financially, so your life would still be stable.
*Can't afford to lose* would be putting so much money for the expectation of doubling, but with huge risk, which is the feeling of greed. Simplest example would be a loan, which will be a *happy* emotional roller coaster ride for you if you decide to do so. Basically money that you will need in the future, which losing it will bring you to a problematic financial state.

You guys do realize that HOLDers have huge risk compared to traders and as an investor i would never just "Hodl" huge amounts.
If the market would crash to zero, Hodlers would have lose all of their money (if they didn't take out their profits of course, but why would you not when you are making so much money?) while a good cryptotrader would lose like 5-20% of his capital depending on his trading strategy. 
So Hodlers just play the lottery here and they got lucky, thats basically it. It could have been that another cryptocurrency would rise to the top like ETH while BTC would just fall to 0$. 
The market is driven by speculators, which is why BTC price is so volatile and price could drop 50% within a day.
If you were an investor then cryptotrading would be **highly** more acceptable than Hodling, because investors look at risk and not at gains, while Hodling is people going "all or nothing" which is more casino style. 
The frontpage is usually full of positive posts about how people made money, but think of how many people bought at 5000 BTC/USD and then it crashed 3000 BTC/USD. 
**Although there is nothing wrong about HODLing. Just understand the risk it has. Don't be an idiot and bet your house on Bitcoin.**
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:00:02
Risking money you are okay to lose is the way things should be. But even then you are focusing more on the potential *loses* while some people like to focus on potential *gains* and not loses, meaning they may put more than they can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-09-30 10:25:24
No that's just looking in the *gains* of the situation and not the risk. 
Traders scenario is you have less gains, but **don't lose all** your money if shit drops.
HODLers scenario is you have bigger gains but **lose almost all** of your money if shit drops.
Imagine if bitcoin dropped to BTC/USD 500$. That obvious better situation is for the crytotraders, because he still has his capital and guess what? He can continue trading, while the HODLers lost **most** of their capital.
Lower capital == Lower gains. As long as you still have your capital, you are in the game.
That's how good investors view things. They don't rely on luck or hope.
Simplest example is where you play a game, where there is a 50% chance you triple your money, or you lose all of your money. When you lose, you are out of the game, you can't play anymore.
If you ignore the loses and only look at the words **triple your money** you already on a road to lose your money. And this is how casinos attract people.

That's why you don't use only one trading platform. Its called risk management.

A trader doesn't have to understand bitcoin to trade it though. He only needs to realize that it is speculators that trade it, meaning it can be very volatile and very risky. Traders only need to see price action. A good trader can look at any chart and tell you what is happening.
In some peoples eyes BTC did actually crash during these weeks it just depends on the timeframe you are looking at. Weekly timeframe its a pullback, but for daily or lower timeframe traders/hodlers it was a crash. 
And of course HODLers can sell at 1000$, but the main idea behind Hodlers is that they buy and hold, meaning they don't take out their invested BTC, because price is volatile, but the overall outcome of it should be profitable. Question is when to withdraw those profits.

Think how much savings you might need on the go in the near future (for 2018). The savings you think you won't need you can invest. If it's hard for you to determine that amount you might require, then just consider how much money you might need each month, then multiply it by 12 and you get the sum you need for the year (plus a little more for yearly expenses, like insurance)
You are in this sub, then obviously you want to invest in bitcoin, which you should, but not all of the remaining amount. Spread your investments, it is not a good idea to put everything on one thing.
Whether it is bitcoin or you are interested in a specific altcoin(s), maybe an ICO that seems profitable or maybe just simple non-crypto investments, it all depends on you how you spread it, but **do your research beforehand**.

Time is an aspect here too. Yes investing in stocks works and you can possibly get more returns than some traders, but it is a slow process. If you don't mind putting money in a stock market and waiting for 10 years, then sure you might get huge returns, but are you willing to wait that long. 
It's really up to the person whether you want a more active approach (trader) or a passive (investor).




I can agree on this.

Check the weekly chart.

That is why it is predictions and not an oracle miracle.
Predictions have a percentage chance of succeeding, most traders get their money from this edge. Even if its 51% accuracy, they will get money in the long run.
If you only view it in the short term then yes it will seem like wizzy-lizzy hokus pokus, but that is what separates people who lose from the traders mindset.
I myself do technical analysis and do agree that if someone says that bitcoin will move in one direction with 100% accuracy is full on nonsense. He might be right one time, but in the long run he'll lose money.
That is why we try and predict, we as traders know that we don't know what will happen, which is why we have risk-reward strategies, so we don't bet our houses when we predict things, otherwise we would be playing the lottery.
Bitcoin market is young and has little history of price action which is why technical analysis is very hard, we don't have that many statistics to make good presumptions.

Oops forgot to check my message box.
If you do want to withdraw 50% of bitcoin (if you didn't already) you can do it, sure. But you don't have to do it in one day. You can withdraw some amount first and then afterwards withdraw smaller amounts passively.
For example, you withdraw 20%. Thats probably quite a lot of money, but since you have things to do in the beginning like getting a proper car, maybe a place to live, basically things you need. How you explain this to others is up to you. Maybe find a person that also has become rich somehow, become friends with. People will less likely doubt that you got rich when you are surrounded by successful people. It may take some hard work and effort to find people like this that aren't attached to money, but are happy overall, will be worth it and the best solution.
Lets say you got 20 000 USD in you bank account after all this. Now you just gotta maintain it, because you need USD, it is more certain, but you also would like to leave a part of your BTC not exchanged. 
So a good strategy of money management is you withdraw 0.5-1 BTC or even less (Lets say its worth 1000-2000 USD) and just use **that** money for sustaining life and keep exchanging these small amounts, maybe once a month, once a week or less (i don't know your expenses). 
Why is strategy is good is for 3 reasons:
* You have a good amount of USD which you will have even if the worst happens to bitcoin. Also have money under your hand case you really need it (emergency situations)
* You have your BTC, which may rise of fall, but obviously the risk can be worth it. Even if BTC/USD = 1000, in the future you will be able to spend them if they become a real currency to spend on food/restaurants/clothes etc. Basically when it becomes mainstream.
* You are withdrawing amounts you need and not risking bad things happening. These small amounts don't cause that much suspicion as a big amount would, you keep your BTC intact, your USD is in place if disaster happens with bitcoin. You got 2 saving accounts open and withdraw from them the money you need.
Be smart about these things. Having a lot of money is a strategy on its own. Even having a lot of dollars and putting them in one bank can be unsafe. Usually a good strategy is to spread your money through different banks. At least 2. Plus putting like 70% of it in investment strategies that banks offer (or you can decide) , because you probably will be fine with the left over 30% for a long period of time.
Save your BTC too. Have 3 flash drives where you cold-store it, put a part of it in online storages. Yes people do say it may not be safe, but that is why you don't put a lot of it in there (like 5% or more). Have a few paper wallets with BTC spread over them. There will never be one 100% safe storage place for BTC. Every startegy has its pluses and minuses. You can lose your flash drives or they might get damaged. BTC on the web might get hacked and so forth.
The biggest risk you are taking is when you put all your money in one place and think that it is safe. It is not, only easier to lose ALL your money. By dividing it you risk only losing PART of your money.
Never take the most profitable option, is it may have the most risk. You want to be an investor not a casino player. With this startegy you put yourself in a position where you don't care what happens as much. BTC might crash, but you still got your dollars. Heck maybe USD will crash, but you will have your BTC then. 
The best poker players are not those that go all in and win a huge jackpot, the best are those that are consistent and know what they are risking, so that even in the blackest day, they will still stand stable.
**TL;DR:** Safety first.
Sidenote: My first post is based on the opinion that Bitcoin will increase to increase your profits, but if you want to play it safer, i actually **would** suggest withdrawing some bitcoins, because the strategy on my first post relies heavily on profits, which in turn takes more risk. 50% is a good figure though, but as i said withdrawing 20% at first and the moving slowly towards that overall 50% withdrawal is a good option( if of course you figured out how to do it without causing a commotion). 
And i don't know how much is your 20%, but if you had 40BTC (100 000 USD), then 8 BTC would be decent.
Lastly if you are reading this today, i want to inform you that BTC is about to make a huge move, based on technical analysis. There is a triangle formation happening so a breakout is due. Just google *triangle formation market* and you will see that i mean. So just be aware and don't get too scared about it.The breakout to the top could possibly reach 3200 USD, so thats a good place to withdraw some BTC, cause it is most likely to have that as the biggest high for the time being. If it happens to the down side, then don't shit your pants too much ;)

50%? Why 50%? Is there any reason you are making this number or simply feeling that half is a good take off?
I am pretty sure you are good with 10-25% take off and you would be fine enough with it. Getting a lot of money in a short notice is actually not a good thing, because you have to start thinking where to put it safely so even if you lose part of your money in you place you still have a part of it safe. Just like you do with bitcoins.
But seriously why would you try to withdraw so much money? If you exchange one bitcoin per month then no body would notice. Keep your money in bitcoin form, since they are gonna increase and withdrawing 50% is a bad strategy, because when you withdraw so much, you only would get half your gains if you withdrew 50%. If on the other hand you withdrew only 10% which would be more than enough for you i believe, when you would get 90% gains if bitcoin rose more. Waaay better strategy.
Unless you want to buy a jet because you feel so rich, but please don't get overwhelmed by the greed. You think you  are rich in this moment, but remember that you have years to spend this money. 
10000$ is a lot to spend, but 10000$ is not a lot to have. Just think how much money you use for eating yearly.
Since you have a good capital, i would highly advise you read a book about financing or investing or just dealing with money in general. This will give you a good way to understand money rationally and not get emotionally overwhelmed by it. You would get an idea how you could manage money and even consider how much you should withdraw.
It might seem easy, but people learn well by loosing some of their capital, since it isn't a very good feeling and you don't want to make mistakes. Problem is with your situation is that your sum of money is a *little* more than what people lose from their earnings of working for 3 months.
It all seems quite simple when you got 500$, 3000$ or 7000$ the amounts are big, but in range of what you spend through the years to maintain your life. 100BTC? I would keep quiete about this if you are an average Joe, because you can make for an easy target if people find out, since you ain't a millionaire like Bill Gates who has people who back him up - he has social power, you don't.
HODLing Bitcoin is one thing. As i understand you don't spend them so much, so you don't have a Ferrari parked outside your home, so nobody start to get suspicious. The people around you might not grasp the idea of bitcoin and since you only mined them and HODLed them, you don't have much of an investors background, so everyone will hardly believe you got them without any illegal activity. Do not share this info. Ever. Unless you are in a position to do so. 
I understand it might be paranoia for someone, but this is money we are talking about. If somebody found out and it spread, would you think it wouldn't interest a gang hearing an average person got a lot of money? It might not happen, but in the news crimes do happen. As an investor you evaluate the risk.
I don't know your background or where you live, but if i assume you are just a random guy that got lucky with bitcoins and might not be too certain about things in life yet, then you understand where this is coming from. If you did, you wouldn't be posting here.
Slowly build your life. Withdraw small amount and "level up" in a sense. Keep moving forward in life by doing things that matter. You have no idea how many people would want to be financially independent so they could do more important jobs in their life. Live a simple life and move up gradually. This is how you will make the best out of your money. You will be confident because you got a secret nobody knows. Later after a year or more, you will become a greater person. Don't rush it. Experience comes with time.
**TL;DR:** Keep quiet and learn how to manage your money, live a normal life, but use the money to build up your life slowly up. And please don't cash out large sums if you have no plans on what to do with it. Your inexperience will make you lose it.
