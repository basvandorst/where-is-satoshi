There was no celebration for aud a month ago

The change fully came through, and it still says "unable to build transaction" if I click CPFP. Is there a fix for this?

thanks ;)

I just had a look, it was set to the maximum fee as well. How long will it be before it auto cancels then?

Beyond selecting "miner feee" in settings, how can I force this change to be the fee?

Sorry man, literally the only thing that I know about btc is how to get it into and out of my wallet. What does that mean? (Sorry for stupid questions)

Spend the maximum balance to where? What am I paying the fee on?
Im sorry for not understanding, but I have a transaction of ~$100usd with 0 confirmations, and ~$5usd in my wallet. How can I increase the fee of something that has already been sent? If I click more options when highlighting the failed transaction, I only have the options "Add to address book" (which doesnt seem relevent), "rebroadcast transaction" and "Bump Fee (CPFP)".
If I click "Bump Fee (CPFP)" it gives "unable to build transaction" as a toast.
Could this simply be because the $5usd still only has 3 confirmations (not done) or is it blocking me from doing this. Im also assuming thats the right button to press...lol.
Is there something I am missing?
Thanks so much, and sorry for being a noob :/

Wait, so its telling me I have to send bitcoin + miner fee from the address I sent the initial BTC to? I have ~5usd (Thank you kind stranger! will repay you if i can :) ), so what am I aiming to do?
EDIT: Just saw the CPFP button (im blind...). I think this is what I need to do, but what exactly will this do?

It wont be 10k in 2025

Lets be honest here. Btc wont become currency. Transactipns take waaaaay too long and fees are waaaaay tok high for it to be currency. Various altcoins could in time, but i doubt btc will ever be more than investment currency (at least in mainstream). Please correct me on how and why im wrong if you disagree

Some countries. Doesnt necessarily mean the US. Could be nigeria hes talking about
