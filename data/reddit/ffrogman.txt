Most sources of hashing power are just based on how fast blocks have been mined over a certain time period. The fluctuations generally just means miners are finding blocks more quickly or more slowly due to chance.

Why is GHash.io capping their block size?

You don't need to buy entire bitcoins at once.

They could be mining with P2Pool, Eligius or any other pool that pays miners with the coinbase transaction.

It depends how much you think difficulty will rise between now and a month after you receive it. Also if it doesn't ship on time you will have a hard time making back profit.

It's the symbol for the Thai baht.

This would be great if it worked out.

Because then we just push the problem until Eligius approaches 50% network hashrate.
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:48:10
Because you could get interest from your investment.

It won't ship until March. Assuming it ships on time difficulty will greatly increase by then. If it comes late you'll have a hard time even breaking even.

That IP address is just one of the first nodes that relayed the transaction. It's rarely the person who actually performed the transaction, so don't bother using that to help you.
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:20:57
Thanks for the information. I wasn't aware of that.
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:29:26
Because bitcoin addresses require a checksum for validation it would be unlikely that using this method would create a valid address by using part of the attacker's key and part of your own. This would result in the transaction being invalid and it would not be accepted by the network.

It's hard to withdraw money from Mt. Gox. Coinbase isn't an exchange, so it takes 4 days to receive your coins via bank transfer.

Blocks that are smaller propagate to the network faster and have a better chance of not being orphaned.
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:47:25


You're making it a lot less secure by doing it. I wouldn't do it myself.


There will always be some software to decrypt it.
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:00:39
There's no actual way to detect hashrate. If I decided to solo mine, but never published any solved blocks then no one would know for sure if I was even mining. However pools are able to have a better estimate of their own hashrate because there are way more shares than blocks solved which lowers variance.

He's mining on p2pool.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:58:39
What do you mean you gave the guy your wallet? If he hasn't moved the coins yet you could possibly take them back, but you need to explain exactly what happened.
@_date: 2014-01-20 00:51:36
Stop trying to look for Satoshi. He wants to be anonymous for a reason.

Then we can just increase the max size of a block.

Loans are still possible. Just like if you were loaning someone cash you still need some way to hold them accountable if they do not pay back. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 22:24:29
No. However if you have funds that you don't want linked to your new address and leave them in multibit you may accidentally include funds from 2 addresses in one transaction and lose the anonymity you are looking for. 
Also if someone had access to your computer they would be able see that you own both addresses.
@_date: 2014-03-09 04:16:40
That limit is entirely based on the maximum size of a block and the average size of a transaction. The maximum size of blocks can be increased if the network starts approaching that rate.

2: Although the transaction takes about 4 days. You will be locked in at the price per bitcoin when you buy. You will have to wait for your first transaction to finish before you can buy more, but after that you will be able to have multiple transactions at once. You'll have to make your own decision on what you think the market will do.

Try Armory because it runs off of Bitcoin-QT, but it has more features and deterministic wallets.
@_date: 2014-01-30 03:00:50
If it's an address that hasn't received transactions ever they're likely lost forever. If it has you could try finding and contacting the owner.

Woo might buy some for myself.

As long as there is a standard for compressing the blockchain then there shouldn't be the need for trust. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 02:42:08
Well the 51% threat is referring to hashrates not percent of the blockchain. I believe that it wouldn't have a major effect in theory, but I'm not sure.

The issue is that importprivkey just works with your key as a string instead of in a file location. As the other user's post says it looks like you have to open up the .key file in a text editor and import all the keys. After importing all the keys one by one. Also, BitcoinQT may not rescan the blockchain automatically, so you may have to restart it if the balances don't show up.

120,000. There aren't 120 million Bitcoins in existence.

It's possible, but very unlikely. As more people lose coins the value of existing coins will go up and people will be more diligent in securing the existing ones.

According to  that was the first bitcoin transaction and it was Satoshi's.

Here's an article that Gavin Anderson linked on his twitter, so it should be reputable.

Generally the transaction fee is .0001 ฿, but sometimes depending on the size of the outputs it can be higher or 0. The money goes to the miner that mined the block that your transaction was included in. You can read more about it here:

Coinbase isn't a direct exchange, so they just tell you the value that you can buy or sell at. They also don't sell other digital currencies, so you would need to find another place to exchange Bitcoins for them.
@_date: 2013-12-31 02:33:36
Satoshi actually mentions this in his whitepaper. One small difference is that you get rid of data once all the outputs have been spent.
If the idea ever gets adopted there will probably always be people with the entire blockchain, while people who want to save space could do so.
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:17:39
Also since I forgot to mention it above: coinbase seems to stay close to the  price, so it generally seems fair.
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:48:54
It's not provably fair.

There is no way to tell if coins are lost.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:15:53
A wallet is just a collection of private keys. I've never used mutlibit, but you should be able to take your exported private keys and go into Bitcoin QT's console to import them. I think the command is: importprivkey [privatekey]. My Bitcoin-Qt client isn't starting right now, but you can access console from somewhere in the settings.

The sum of all the bitcoins transacted times the number of days that those coins have been sitting in one address. The spike means a lot of coins that were stagnant for a long time were transferred that day.
