I personally don't mind this type of critique.
National fiat currencies also doesn't produce anything in themselves, yet may both rise and fall in relation to other currencies. Traditional fiat currencies are subject to high inflation through money printing and central bank directives while bitcoin's inherent rate of inflation is set to halve every 4 years. Bitcoin only needs to achieve less inflation than standard fiat currencies in order to appreciate in value over time. One inherent value is inflation\-resistance. Another inherent value is social trust.
When humans utilize wind, water and solar power, it's not because these natural phenomena produces anything particular, but rather, humans have found ingenious ways to produce energy from naturally occurring fluctuations in nature. Fluctuations in currencies, stock markets and precious metal markets generate profits as well. If we believe that stocks only generate money as a result of production, we forget about the main driving force for that profit: trust. When trust falls, stocks fall as well. Trust is an inherent social value that determines if a commodity is valuable.
When bitcoin rise in value over time, it's a result of inflation resistance, social trust and the inherent values of an autonomous and safe value transfer. Central banks no longer have monopoly over transfer of value. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have opened up a free market where money transfer is now subject to competition. Fiat currencies are expected to lose some of their market capitalization in the process.

I think when people are becoming frustrated they are likely spending too much time watching the charts. There will be the standard tops, dips, mesas, barts, valleys, mountains, ups and downs. There's plenty of other things I'd rather watch in real\-time. :\)

The recent 8.3k range action reminds me of the fluctuations at 6.8k when bitcoin was hovering around the last lowest floor. It was a relatively small-range oscillation over several days.
When the 9.7k price level broke down, I was mentally prepared for a new market cycle if it turned out that the range 7.7k-8.2k failed. However, at this point, I am considering the possibility that we might already have a new market cycle building up at current price levels. If that's the case, then I wouldn't be surprised to see some heavy purchases of specific alt-coins.

Personally I think the market need to recover at least a few days. I am positive for mid-April.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:25:16
A bit too early in my opinion. I expect a lot of traders selling at 8.5k, 9k, 9.5k and 9.8k. Sure, there will likely be bounces after sales but the market is a bit turbulent and jaded at the moment so I don't expect fast ascents. Perhaps a slow growth, with dips and all, is better long-term.
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:46:02
That's fine, I forgive you! :D
The market has been hard to read recently so there's no shame in making the wrong bet at times.
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:53:39
I doubt a drop to 4k, but we all have our different bets. If the price dropped below 6k then I wouldn't expect it to stay down for very long. Time will tell. At least the market has turned more interesting recently and people can't complain about it being boring.
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:01:14
I sold at just below 9k and re-bought at 7.8k, plus added some extra funds. The market should have improved by mid-April.
I expect to see a revisit to 9k within a week or so, which would mean a decent 15% profit from 7.8k. In a less optimal scenario I might have to wait 1-2 weeks extra. That's fine, I don't need fast returns. My main bitcoin stash is for long-term holding for 2-5 years.
It appears that the bounces have been adamant at around 7.7k. A similar scenario played out during the last dip to 7.3k; at 2.5% over the McAfee prediction line it seemed like bots bought up bitcoins and consumed the fall successfully. It was just a bit hilarious to watch it happen again, at 2.5% over the McAfee line, when certain traders were so certain to revisit 7.3k - 7.5k.
The McAfee line will fall one day, though that day is not today. Nor is it tomorrow or around the corner.

At least the market appear to slowly recover for now. I wouldn't rule out more dips though. Even if the market goes up there will be the usual daily swings. Waiting a few days for the market to properly recover is probably a good idea.

Not to the moon, but hopefully stabilizing back towards 8.5k and then a slow ascent upwards.

Quote from the Forbes article:
"I wrote this article, in fact, for those cooler heads – those of you who are interested in cryptocurrency but would only support the movement in ethical ways. The question for you is whether we let the rotten core of hatred set the direction for the movement – especially as they either condone criminal activity or are criminals themselves."
Sorry, I don't buy this narrative and I don't agree that cryptocurrency is full of antisemitism. Bitcoin is for everyone. There's nothing in the protocol that excludes a person based on observable or non-observable characteristics.
The more insidious part of the article is the intentionally false boolean thesis: either bitcoin owners are criminals, or they support criminals. This is a very dangerous view of human beings and can lead to a totalitarian society if we are not careful, where people can be labeled as criminals by proxy when conducting normal, legal economic activities in a free market economy.
I intend to invest my taxed income as I see fit in modern assets of my own choosing, such as bitcoin, without unsubstantiated demonization from dinosaurs that display minimal understanding of the subject they are discussing, or rather, preaching from high pulpits.
Artists and freelancers all over the world are not going to give up receiving commission for their work in a host of legal currencies in the free market, including bitcoin. Attempting to criminalize them for receiving payment through a competing currency is beyond absurd if we believe in a free market.
If some backwards-facing lawmakers attempt to make bitcoin illegal in a specific country, producers of value will simply move to where they can find a free market where they can thrive and build in entrepreneuring spirit.
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is a torch of hope in many emerging economies of the world. They can provide wealth and entrepreneurial activity to areas that were formerly poor agrarian, giving them a chance to leapfrog forward and become part of the competition.

@_date: 2018-03-03 19:09:02
I am a newcomer as well; I bought in at just over $8K after the crash to $6K.
While the price may rise to 12K or more 'soonish', I am personally more inclined to think that the prize will revisit 10K within a week from now, perhaps already tomorrow Sunday. After that it may well bounce back at over 13K, who knows. The volumes are very low right now which isn't a great sign for bullish trends.
I acknowledge the possibility that I might be wrong, but my point is: take your time and see where the price is heading. Don't let fear of missing out (FOMO) cloud your judgement. It's usually safe to wait a little to see trends emerge over a few days' time.
One possibility is to buy a small amount right now and see how that goes. Once you have a small BTC balance this will help you to learn about how to best send and store it safely. Also, you will learn more about the market once you have dipped your toes into the water and have a stake in the game.
I recently bought a Trezor and a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet and they have made trading so much easier, can warmly recommend both of them for increased security. If you wish to expand your portfolio to other cryptocurrencies at some point, hardware wallets will aid you greatly. At first I used mainly cold storage paper wallets, which are pretty good for long term holding but not so efficient if you need speedy transactions, or if you own a number of different cryptocurrencies that you need to keep in order.
Stay chill, have fun and don't stress. :)

@_date: 2018-03-11 11:55:45
I would say that this is wishful thinking. I would love low prices to buy bitcoin, but the key is to bring realism to the table if you wish to play the game.
It is obvious that the Kobayashi sales affected the crash from ATH in December towards 6th of February. There were certainly other factors playing in such as fears, bots, whales and BTC being overpriced at 20k as a result from a steep climb.
As far as we know most of the Mt Gox debt is paid off and Kobayashi isn't allowed to sell anything until the next court proceedings in September.
The recent crash is likely affected by strong fears from the worst crash that happened a month ago. This is a reasonable fear, however the factors that caused the previous crash are not present this time around, at least not to any comparable degree.
Regarding the price of bitcoin, it is determined by the market supply and demand. Bitcoin miners invest in equipment and expect a particular ROI over time. Before the last crash it was clear that a price of between 10k-11k was relatively stable, which is a level that miners are likely to expect the market to return to within the coming weeks. If they are wrong, they might have to settle for a price a little bit below.
However, miners with capital investments in equipment will also have a barrier below their expected sale price. They may accept to sell below this level for a while, but the further the price drops, the more incentive they have to wait for a rebound. Every drop of $1000 means a substantial loss of potential revenue for miners (calculated against their projected ROI), which reduces their incentive to sell and increase their incentive to wait.
While it is impossible to predict prices, the market attempt to assess the level of real and tangible risks over short and longer term, compare with previous crashes and make predictions based on plausibility. Fears and negative news are weighed against potentials for profit, stabilization and growth, combined with investments and expected ROI.
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:53:00
With all respect for religious beliefs, let's not make bitcoin an article of faith. Have a good day and best of luck with your investments. I am positive for mid-April and onwards.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:58:04
Not sure what he means either.
I suppose that some people considered bitcoin to be overpriced when it was at 20k, as a result of the steep climb. And in that context, it was probably overpriced at that point due to the fast increase.
However, there's no reason to consider it overpriced at the moment. When miners invest in equipment for a long term ROI, they are not likely to reduce their price expectations dramatically. Personally I think the price will keep over 8k from here on. We'll not see 6k levels anytime soon. I say this with regret since I would have loved to buy at that price.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:22:58

Right, it appears like you say more as a general suggestion for newcomers in order to avoid unnecessary risks.
I think for people that want to both hold and trade, it makes sense to have a separate stack for each. Many people who complain about holding don't seem to factor in that you can do both at the same time. If your trading stack is separate, then there is less risk of fomo-based decisions since you already have a stack for holding.
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:40:10
Haha, true that. There are times when you may benefit from going against the general consensus. As long as people trust their own judgement, going against the stream can be a good thing.
@_date: 2018-03-18 00:25:10
Let's secure 8.5k and 9k first, and we'll keep the subsequent goals within reach. Steady upwards sounds good, to let the price be tested at intervals. 20k is at least half a year away I think. 50k will not happen this year but perhaps the coming years.

@_date: 2018-03-31 16:29:55
Sorry Sir, doom was cancelled. Would you like to order doom for another date?
On a serious note, the market is extremely hard to read at the moment. As a result I think many traders are waiting for better opportunities, either an increase in price or a definitive drop. So far the recent drops have been cancelled fairly quickly. If sellers are responsible they don't necessarily need to tank the price that much.
My reflection is that the market behavior and response after the crash appear to have been smart so far.
@_date: 2018-03-30 09:31:48
Sure, it would be awesome to buy bitcoin at 3k. But for that to happen we would need objective factors that are worse than the conditions leading towards the crash to 5.8k in early February. So far I haven't seen such conditions yet.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:07:04
Sure, I understand your perspective.
There are a host of factors that affect price speculation and if we allow speculators to claim that bitcoin is going to zero, $10 or $1000, there's no reason to complain about people estimating the next floor or roof either. At least that's a theory which can be tested in the near future. If it breaks, the theory didn't hold water and we learned something. Calls for $1000-$3000 however are more difficult to test and can therefore hover around without evidence, and certainly in the opposite direction as well, such as calls for $100,000 etc.
Personally I think that considering the lowest point at the market crash of February 6th, the market development since then hasn't been all bad, in spite of crashes and corrections. We know that the ATH of December 17th was inflated, we just don't know by how much. There's no magical power that demands that the price from here has to either go up or down exclusively. People will naturally attempt to figure out where the market is going next.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:33:23
I think you are overcomplicating things. Holding is a general advice for newcomers, it's not a god-given commandment and people can both hold and trade at the same time using different stacks. One of the benefits of holding is that filing taxes will be far easier for holders since every trade is a taxable event. (Trading myself, perhaps I will one day wish that I listened to that advice, who knows)
If I had bought bitcoin at 20k, I would have sold it at a point where I observed solid indications of a drastic fall in price, and then rebought back later at a far lower price. However, this is also a potentially risky maneuver if the timing isn't properly executed. As a generalized advice, holding is a decent strategy until a person has gained experience with the market, and even for experienced traders it may turn out to be a good strategy for long-term investment. In any case, experienced traders at least have the options to adjust to a changing situation.
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:21:34
Sure. I trade both upwards and downwards alone myself as well. But some traders play it safe and work in pools. If bulls did the same the market would be less onesided.

Fair enough. Bitcoin is probably a bit of both at this point.
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:04:05

I understand your perspective. Mining is naturally important for the security of transactions and decentralization of bitcoin. Though for me as a non-miner, I find it interesting, in addition, that mining could function as a price-stabilizing factor as well.

@_date: 2018-03-28 16:25:57
That's just because some traders are hell-bent on revisiting 7.5k. It won't happen since the bounce at 7.7k is stronger than their attempts. So the tops will start to improve, since that's the only way to leverage profit when the floor isn't yielding. From a trading perspective it doesn't matter if you gain profit from upwards or downward market direction. If it can't go further down, profit has to be sought elsewhere: upwards.

Right, I did invest more fiat at 6.9k when the price had zig-zagged down from 7.8k. While I could have invested even more at 6.5k, I have reached my bitcoin goals for the time being. And like yourself, I don't really expect prices to go below 7k anytime soon after we enter into proper recovery phase. It may happen, I just wouldn't count on it. Mid-April is generally a time of growth for bitcoin so I think we have decent times ahead. Have a good weekend.

To be fair, they are generally talking about cryptocurrencies. It is always reasonable to mention risks in relation to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin has its risks, and cryptocurrencies in general are super risky in the sense that they have a far shorter track record. Investments that are risky also provide opportunities for profit. I personally consider the opportunity vs risk being far better in regards to bitcoin compared with 99% of the competitors. That said, I do hold a few altcoins, but I make it a point to not own more than I am willing to lose.
Many of the alts that don't have the 9 year track record of bitcoin may end up belly-up. We have already watched a host of alts drop recently, even when bitcoin have been going upwards. When alts tank too much, people tend to consolidate in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-18 00:43:15
30k by April is way too optimistic, probably won't happen this year. Don't get me wrong, I am optimistic, I just prefer a slower and more steady climb where the different levels of price can be properly tested through trial by fire. Gains that are the result of sudden overvaluation will cause more problems than they solve.
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:00:53
I think we're ascending the mountain at this point, but honestly I prefer a slow and steady climb. And I expect drops at about 10.5k'ish if we reach that level within a few days. Though after the drop, perhaps back to 9k, I think the market stability will be in far better shape. Sure, traders benefit from the market volatility so that's not going away, I just expect to see a bit more confidence in the market at that point, which should reduce the risks of dropping back to 8k anytime soon.

I think it's safe to conclude that the recent crash has been far less severe, judging from objective factors, compared with the crash from ATH in December towards the final valley and bounce at 6th of February. This time Kobayashi hasn't sold off anything, and as far as we know the Mt Gox debt is more or less paid off.
(Credit to FlorianManner for posting the link)
While the price of Bitcoin is still affected by fears from the recent crash, combined with fears of near future drops, I personally doubt to see a drop below $8000 at this point in time. At the moment a lot of potential buyers naturally want to wait and see where the final bottom occurs, which reduces the demand presently.
On the other hand of the spectrum we have bitcoin miners and potential sellers that expect a rise towards 10-11k levels within a week or the coming weeks. Considering the recent crash and the fears in the market they might have to settle for 9.5k presently even though they consider 10k+ to be a reasonable market price in a market that isn't affected by strong fears.
The question is then how low the sellers and miners are willing to go below their expected sale price. On the one hand, if they wait, the prices will eventually recover from the crash. On the other hand, if they need cash right away they might sell now if they fear a further drop.
If the market sellers expects a return to 10-11k levels within a foreseeable future, then every thousand dollars below this line is considered a substantial loss of potential revenue. This is why I don't expect to see prices below 8k at the moment; it may happen as a quick visit from sellers that need urgent cash, but a few exceptions won't dictate the price for long.
This is why I think that predictions of a price below 5.8k is wishful thinking: yes, I would love such low prices to accumulate more BTC, but I don't think there would be enough sellers that would consider that price range to be beneficial. Since 11k is a definite possibility in the coming weeks, only a fool would sell below the worst crash bitcoin has seen, from which it has recovered remarkably since then. Further drops may happen, but the question is how likely a particular drop is compared to expected sale prices.

Right, many of us keep the crazy idea of investing in ourselves when we will one day drop dead, either by age, by illness or by unforeseen causes. As he proclaimed as truth, it must be merely sunk cost fallacy at play, since every complex matter can be reduced to oneliners in today's world.
Saving for the future is also a gamble since I might die before I have time to enjoy my savings. Still, I'd gladly take that gamble, aware of the risks and potential benefits involved.
At the end of the day, people will continue to project months and years ahead to the best of their abilities, trusting their judgement and risk-vs-gains analysis in face of all the countless possibilities that could thwart their hopes and effort. There will be those that lose what they risked and those that gained from their risks. As long as people don't invest more than they are willing to lose, I couldn't complain or moralize about their decisions.

Bitcoin and crypto currencies are high risk volatile assets. Don't invest unless you are interested in supporting the technology and have made your own thorough research.
Nobody can guarantee that bitcoin is going up in the long-term. It's up to you to do your research and come up with your own opinion if you think it is a suitable long-term investment or not.
There are plenty of link resources to the right of the screen and we have a mostly friendly and slightly crazy community. Take your time and learn about the technology.
Bitcoin is not a get rich quick solution. It demands that you to take responsibility for your financial decisions, that you are ready to be your own bank and learn the fundamentals of crypto security, transaction and wallet security as well as evaluate risks and potentials.
Welcome and enjoy your stay.

Interesting topic.
I think there is a refreshing and decently overlapping terrain of nuances between considering the respected insights of professionals, to processing the flow of ideas and experiences in a young emerging, volatile market full of new and unorthodox entrepreneurial perspectives.
At the end of the day, the final analysis and judgement need to be anchored within a person's own conclusions regarding the market, since that is where the risk, blame, loss or potential profit ultimately reside. When expectations and projections are rejected by the market, which will happen from time to time, there is opportunity to learn and adjust.
Apart from the dryness of analysis I also appreciate the nuggets of humor I can pick up every now and then. Overall I think the bitcoin community is pretty entertaining, warts and all. There's plenty of knowledge at the reach of a keyboard, as long as people sift and filter.

Good for him, at least in the short term. On the other hand, a lot of people also sold at the 'top', at 1k a year ago. Hindsight is always profitable in theory. There is nothing wrong with securing profits and diversify them among multiple asset classes. It's been 3 weeks since 10k now and I think we will see it return by mid April based on the charts from 2017 and 2016. I could certainly be wrong but that's my bet.
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:16:21
I think it's more complicated than that. Miners invest in hardware and often have long term ROI over spans of 6-12 months, sometimes more. From rational self interest alone they are not likely to sell far below a price level they consider to be plausible.
If the market is willing to buy bitcoin at 10k, which it was recently, every $1k drop below this level is a major potential loss of revenue for miners and thus reduces their incentive to sell. As a result of hardware investments and projected ROI, miners provide some degree of stability to the price of bitcoin. If the price of bitcoin rebounds, which it generally does, the miners that can afford to wait one or a few weeks with selling have incentive to wait for better prices.
While miners will certainly sell when they consider it profitable, adding newly mined coins to the market, they will be less inclined to sell at a price that they consider to be greatly undervalued. This is why the price of bitcoin is not purely speculative; it's influenced by hardware investments and the projected ROI of a large number of miners.

I view the situation as a litmus test for both bitcoin and the altcurrencies. Almost all major altcurrencies are lower at this point than they were during the crash at 6th of February, while bitcoin is hovering just below 8k. This is about 2k higher than its lowest point this year in comparison.
While bitcoin has bled, the altbleeding has been far more severe, contributing to leverage bitcoin's market dominance. As a newcomer, the situation shows me in practical terms the level of stability that bitcoin possess under pressure in comparison to its forks. If the recent crashes have been a correction of sorts, it appears that the most noticeable sets of overvaluations have involved the alts.
When bitcoin is sufficiently undervalued it will bounce as a result of the degrees of profitability involved. If I remember correctly the last time it bounced was at about 2% over the McAfee line; we're seeing the price hovering at 4.5% over that line at the moment. It will be interesting to see how it performs this time. Not saying that I agree with McAfee's prediction - I don't, however his prediction provides a direct line to compare the low-end spectrum of the price with.

We'll see what mid-April brings. Perhaps reality will finally kick in for those that have kept a very one-sided negative perspective. Personally I both hold and trade at the same time with two different stacks.
Multiple strategies are possible at the same time. I am positive long-term and during a bear market I will attempt to benefit from swings when I judge the risk-vs-profit being at a reasonable level.
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:18:04
We probably won't reach 12k soonish. If we reach 11.5k then I expect at least a 'small' drop to 10k, perhaps 9k. After that I expect a general upwards trend with occasional smaller drops. I could be wrong, that's just my speculation. Weigh in the speculations of others and you'll get a decent spread of opinions.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:32:00
Sure man. If you are worried for the sky falling down perhaps you should congregate somewhere safe and let us invest and trade in peace, since our bet is that the world is not coming to an end anytime soon and neither is bitcoin. Thank you for your time and concern and have a good weekend. We'll be fine, don't worry too much about us.
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:21:01
Just my dry sense of humor. A price at 5k at this point would be as plausible as a sudden swing up to 13k. While both of them could happen, they probably won't. A price over 8.5k might hurt a few dedicated bears though, which is the humor.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:01:46
I think miners are important for crypto for several reasons. Among the reasons is that their hardware investments and projected ROI add a certain level of objective metrics to the value of a cryptocurrency. While some miners may sell below their expected price at times, they also represent a group of bitcoin owners that have a measure of resistance towards selling below a profitable price.
When certain people say that the price of bitcoin is entirely made up, I think that this position is lacking in nuances. While the market supply and demand establishes the price discovery, miners bring certain objective criteria to the equation.

My speculations could be wrong so just keep that in mind. :)
However, here's a source for the Mt Gox proceedings:
Bloomberg tech reporter Yuji Nakamura on the subject of Mt Gox:
@_date: 2018-03-30 09:39:11
I'd say that compared with yesterday, there is an increased volume and resistance. Appear to be a stalemate for now. Yesterday I bet on the price going down due to low volumes and behavior of traders so I sold at 7.8k and bought back at 6.9k, with a couple of stops and bounces in between.
Today the market seem to be in different shape and more hard to read. Directional bets appear to be more risky at the moment, at least that's my impression. Not sure if bears or bulls might see losses today, could go both ways. For mid-April I am bullish based on the charts from 2017 and 2016, so there might be increasing buying pressure in the air.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:37:57
Good plan there man, you wouldn't need a large amount of satoshi for that either. :D I wouldn't complain if I was wrong. :)
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:18:12
That's a valid perspective. For me, I look to the sell volumes contra the buy volumes. And that's what I trust. I think it's healthy for newcomers to hear that they shouldn't stress. If they wait and take time to read the market they often get better deals, especially at a turbulent time close after a crash. I don't think the final bottom and bounce is in place yet.
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:46:05
Most of these bounces are fairly weak. Especially for newcomers, I think it is a bit improper to advice them to buy until we have reached solid bottom of this steep stair fall. 8.5k might be solid floor with proper bounce, though it might also go as low as 8k. This is just my opinion, but considering the candlesticks and the drop volumes lately, I'd say that this drop isn't over yet, contrasted with the lower buy volumes. We'll go back up after the drop I am sure, but this is not the best time to buy. It's always hard to catch the perfect bottom, but I'd wait a bit with buying. There will always be a limit to a fall; when people find the price too good to resist buying. The positive aspect is that after a drop, where the currency is considered undervalued enough by the market to warrant a strong buy volume, there will be a healthy rebound.
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:45:32

The safest bets in crypto are hardware wallets, such as Trezor or Ledger Nano S. Yes, they cost a bit but are far more secure. Consider it an investment and reduction of risks. Paper wallets are for long term storage; this is for amounts that you don't expect to use in the near future.  Using library computers doesn't sound very safe. And sorry to say, if people are addicted and/or intoxicated they should stay far away from crypto transactions.
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:15:16
I would assume that shorters prefer to coordinate in larger pools of shorting-traders to spread the risk and leverage better pool liquidity. If bulls are smart they will likewise coordinate in larger pools of long-traders and buyers, scooping low and selling high, with the combined pool liquidity reducing the average cost-risk factor. When both tactics disrupt each other there will be more risk for the shorters and that's when we will see a less onesided market.
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:41:32
Well, there isn't much point in withdrawing 0.007 + 0.003 BTC from CEX.IO when the withdrawal limit is 0.01 BTC, since the withdrawal fee for Bitcoin there is 0.001 BTC, which is about $11.50 @ current rate. With the costs they have you should only withdraw larger amounts of BTC. I am not sure if the fee of 0.001 BTC is included in the withdrawal limit of 0.01 BTC; if that's the case then you would need 0.011 BTC to withdraw.
In spite of the steep fees, every withdrawal and deposit I have made with cryptocurrency there have worked fine so far. Some individuals have reported severe problems withdrawing cash through money transfer from CEX.IO and lacking customer support. To be fair this is a common complaint on many exchanges that offer cash withdrawal, however, I would suggest to keep it in mind. Be careful in regards to every exchange, CEX.IO included.

There will be the regular yo-yo'ing as always since traders are going to trade for profits, and nothing wrong with that. The important change is that the terrain is less one-sided and that people are more confident in investing upwards. This brings more risks for shorting compared with before during periods of segmented free-fall, which in my opinion balances the market somewhat.

Interesting article by Hugo Nguyen, thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:51:41
First, I don't think that all coins will be on the market, for obvious reasons.
My speculation is that there are a variety of motives involved, but most of them based on rational self-interest.
A. Whales who trade all or part of their bitcoin holdings will probably prefer manageable crashes from time to time; they sell high and buy back in low as long as they have a general confidence in the asset.
B. Whales who mainly seek a long-term hedge against inflation combined with profits are likely to prefer a stable, steady growth of value. While they may sell off portions of their holdings at strategic positions, they have no interest in extremely deep market crashes that may damage their long term investments.
If you combine these two strategies I would expect a slow, steady growth with occasional crashes followed by recovery; this benefits both strands of strategy. With sufficient agents involved the individual exceptions should not dictate the market.

"These large financial institutions wouldn’t be putting resources and people into cryptocurrencies if they didn’t feel they weren’t viable."
Pardon me, but English is not my native language and I was wondering if there is actual need for the double negative here?
This sentence structure would make more sense for me:
"These large financial institutions wouldn’t be putting resources and people into cryptocurrencies if they didn’t consider them to be viable."
Or another variant if we have to go with the 'feels':
"..if they felt that they weren't viable"
The article was fine overall, I just had to re-read that particular sentence a couple of times.

As I see it, either the impacts of speculation are reduced over time as a result of the growth, or they are worsened. My personal bet is that the market grows more stable over time, while retaining enough volatile qualities to promote activity and headlines. If I am wrong, I am willing to take a hit; I only invest what I can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:59:28
Yup. I have had a few laughs recently observing wishful traders attempting to push the price downwards, while it appears that bots have been programmed to buy up bitcoins at about 2.5% over the McAfee line. Same happened during the previous dip to 7.3k. Bots bought bitcoins at 2.5% over the line at that point as well. So yeah, seems like the bottoms are getting higher.
Don't get me wrong, I am sure the McAfee line will be broken at some point, I just don't think it will happen in the near future.
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:56:17
The market is doing fine considering the recent crash. All I know is that it's too unpredictable at the moment for me to make any bets. When the market behaves like a force of nature I am not going to stand in its way. There will be dips along the way but overall the purchase power is pretty strong. I can imagine that shorters have had some stress lately.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:39:55
Uhm, no. Better to get back at 7.5k and 8k first, then those levels need to be tested by the market and from there the price can progress either up or down. I'd like to see 9k-10k within the coming weeks and that would be a great start.

No, not any price under ATH is a steal, that's a misuse of words. 20k was inflated, get over it, the market corrected the price downward from there. There are a number of reasons that could cause the price to drop and probably the US tax season doesn't improve the situation.
When the price of bitcoin is sufficiently undervalued the potentials for gains will propel a proper bounce.

Sorry but the apple analogy here wasn't great. The price of 1 apple is decided by supply and demand. If we don't know the demand then we don't know the price. So we can't say for sure that 1 apple will be worth $50 in your example. If you phrase it differently I might agree with some points.
Suggestion: if the total apple market in the world is worth $100, then yes, one apple should reasonably be worth somewhere around $50 in your example. Until there is news of a batch of 1000 more apples. :) If the apple market is restricted to 2 apples in total, and that market is worth $100, then we might be in agreement.

Sorry to hear about this terrible experience. I agree that if they are not scamming you, this appear to be a sign of poor organization. They need to prioritize tickets better than this, regardless if their customer support is flooded. Taking a month to fix a transfer problem is unacceptable.
Personally I have used Cex.io for less than two weeks and so far my transactions have worked fine. My main complaint would be the transaction fee of 0.001 BTC (presently $11.5), but I haven't seen any scam signals yet. But even then, a poor ticket organization and overburdened customer support is bad enough.
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:55:36
There have been plenty of past pumps in spite of lacking institutional money.
While there are bots and humans trading all the time, at low volumes there's always risk of coordinated traders attempting either drops or pumps. Drops are generally more cost-efficient unless there is decent resistance. It's just hard to extract a particular price range from a complex set of factors.
For the price to drop to a particular point the sellers need to be more eager to sell than the buyers to buy. At lower prices this equation changes, making it hard to predict a potential price range several thousand dollars downwards or upwards.
On the other hand, the benefit of drops and crashes is that newcomers can enter at a better price point, which increase the market. Newcomers coming in at an ATH will generally have a less positive experience.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:10:23
Oh damn, I am not sure if bitcoin can absorb a dump of $20 downwards after you sold your weekly GPU mining profit. :D
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:55:58
Well, we don't really know.
However considering that Dow Jones and Nasdaq are currently recovering in a general upwards trend from the downward plunge between January 28th to February 6th, I would assume that the BTC market will follow that general lead at least to a degree. The Dow Jones chart upwards trend at 4h intervals is looking great in my opinion.
In addition, in many European countries wages are paid this week which increases the overall purchase power. Since December it appears that Wednesday to early Saturday tend to give positive trends for BTC.
While there is always a risk for another dip towards $8K-$9K due to larger BTC speculators selling on their short-term cycle, I am generally positive for this week. 12K will definitely be an interesting point, especially since it offers a doubling of value for those that bought in at 6K just short of two weeks ago.

@_date: 2018-03-18 08:24:09
I am speaking long-term. Also, I don't consider the ATH at 20k as a normal price ringe; it was obviously inflated in relation to the fast ascent. A price range of around 10k is more likely a balanced level to calculate from, so yes, we have seen substantial drops from that level, I completely agree with that. What happens on the yearly horizon is where hedging against inflation comes in.

When I see a 1 cent positioning I generally expect it to be a bot, i.e. a script which is trading based on algorithms. Sure, at times it may be a human, but if you see rapid, repeated positioning of this nature, it's likely a bot. This kind of scripting causes a lot of seemingly irrational down- and upward movement in price, especially when many bots react to each other's activities. Then add human interactions on top of that. :)

@_date: 2018-03-16 18:38:43
As far as I understand the matter:
The next creditor's meeting will be in September. The trustee isn't expected to sell any more BTC or BCH until then. The court will decide if there will be Civil Rehabilitation, which could result in the remaining bitcoins being distributed among their legitimate owners. I heard that the earliest news might arrive this summer, if not, we'll have to wait until September. Presently all claims have been covered by the sales of BTC and BCH, so there's no reason for the trustee to touch the stashes of coins; he has no reason to forego the court decision.
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:20:38
While I am open to the possibility that the $8500-$8800 range might be tested again during the coming days, I am not so sure that it will go as low as below $8k at this point in time. A week from now I expect the price will gravitate towards $10k-$11k, which is where the market supply and demand seem to strike a convincing balance as long as there is no fear of an immediate crash. I could certainly be wrong but that's how I read the market at the moment. Considering the amount of uncertainty in the market after the crash, it is hard to say anything with certainty. I think at the end of the day, the long term projections will guide the price discovery, in spite of fears.

My point is that I am interested to see how the crashes have impacted bitcoin, that's why I calculate from the lowest low after the market crash and correction. The ATH at 20k was obviously caused by sudden pumping so my perspective is to see what happens after the market corrections. If you wish to include the timeframe of bitcoin and altcoins being pumped before the ATH, that's fine, that's just not how I would calculate if I want to see how they fare under stress.
@_date: 2018-03-24 11:28:05
I suggest for people to study several of the top altcurrencies and their market depth, examine where traders expect, or intend, to sell and buy. Traders bought BTC heavily at 7.5k and appear to have sold a decent amount at 9k. Some traders may have sold at 8.3k-8.8k. Considering the low volumes, I'd say that trader impact is fairly high at the moment. My observation is that there is more sell pressure than buying pressure at this point and the descent volumes have been overall higher than the ascent volumes recently.
My speculation is that the most active participants right now, traders of various kinds, are waiting for at least 8k-8.5k until they rebuy. The more patient traders probably look for 7.5k-8k.
I have been wrong many times so far so don't pay attention to my speculation. However, check the market depth of both bitcoin and major altcoins yourself and make up your own mind based on the data that is available. While I had preferred to observe an upswing to 10k soon, that's not what I see yet. Add the tax season with bitcoin and altcoin owners needing to make sure to finish paying their taxes, which adds some sell pressure.
As a counterbalance to my observation, a number of miners probably will have a decent resistance to sell below 8.5k-9k. As a result, the resistance might be strong enough to keep the price over 8.5k. It is also possible that some traders might want to pump up the price to 9.5k-10k before selling, so don't take my speculation as investment advice. If the resistance is strong enough at 8.5k, then traders might have to adapt to the situation and reconsider their strategies. If not, I'd say that 8k is definitely a possibility. I doubt to see any prices below 7.5k though.
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:14:15
It could go higher than 8.5k. Sorry boys.

The buildup to ATH in mid-December and subsequent crashes/dips/corrections can be explained from a wide variety of perspectives without the need for some perceived culprit.
I am sure there is some degree of market manipulation since cryptocurrency markets are unregulated. (That's why other markets are regulated) Combine this with bot trading, greed, fear, whale traders and possibly pools of traders working together for mutual benefit. However, this isn't equal to assigning blame to a particular entity.
If you think the market is manipulated in some shape or form, then join together with other traders in order to counteract potential manipulation.

That's possible and would be a welcome trend. Just be aware of the risk that some miners and traders may dump a bit at 10.5-11.5k. Or, they may have shaky hands and dump too early, in which case it may bounce, perhaps even towards 12k.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:00:38
Nah, the Mt Gox trustee won't sell without permission from the court. We'll find out in September, or at earliest this summer. In any case, the fiat claims are already covered. If they exit the bankruptcy they may proceed to civil rehabilitation and the remaining coins may be distributed among the plaintiffs.

When Bitcoin reaches $50K, who cares when someone bought at $10K, $15K or $20K.
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:17:58
While I certainly want to see 15K+ at some point, I wouldn't be surprised if the rate drops to between 9K-10K USD in the coming week. If it goes south of 10K I will likely buy some more. Any dip below 9K would be special treat. Should Bitcoin rise over 12K that would be pretty cool as well.
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:54:35
True enough, though especially in the context of a crash/dip/correction and during the corresponding price discovery.
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:54:29
1. You are presuming that there will be an upcoming crash as if it were a fact. Sure, crashes happen from time to time. However, at this point a crash has happened and the general 8k territory has shown to be resilient. Sure, it might drop to 7.5k, who knows, but the recent crash lacks several of the factors that contributed to the worst crash down to 5.8k.
2. If bitcoin bleeds, most alts will bleed as well. People are more likely to consolidate larger amounts into an undervalued bitcoin than into dipped alts. It is far more difficult to determine when alts are undervalued due to the fact that they are relatively new.
In the case of an unexpected bitcoin crash below 7.5k, I'd rather suspect that a number of investors might fear that certain alts might head towards dangerous territory, sell them and consolidate into bitcoin. Or perhaps, they might prepare for this in advance if they fear it to happen.
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:25:47
Understandable and probably a decent strategy. Since my main BTC stack is for holding I enjoy a price rise as well. My BTC trading stack is smaller than my holding stack and I use it as a backup-plan to make smaller gains from fluctuations for times when my holding stack isn't making short-term progress. Long-term I am bullish.
@_date: 2018-02-19 08:18:16
He probably means well.
I think these types of sentiments is an indication that there is still a vast potential for crypto market growth from where we stand today. While there are always risks involved with crypto currency investment, the elements of risk and uncertainty are factors that also increase the potentials for profitability if the investment turns out to be backed by the supply and demand of the market.

Better to send several smaller transactions; less risk per transaction and no reason for banks to jump to the wrong conclusions. Sure you get multiple fees, but at least you mitigate risks. Some banks are jumpy for no reason I have heard.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:37:08
I think miners provide a decent stability to the price and many miners won't sell below 12k. With their hardware investment and projected ROI they add a natural anchoring to the price. This is why I think that quick ascents are not going to hold very well. A slower rise will be better anchored in mining infrastructure investments.
Though, I enjoy hearing different opinions of price projections and I won't brush aside a June spike as impossible, I just don't see 30k anytime soon.

Perhaps you could state your theory in a more specific manner?
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:27:55
Nah, that's just wishful thinking. We're going above 9k is what I think.
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:22:03
Seems I was wrong after all, there was a bounce of sorts. However, not sure where the price is going right now, up or down. Perhaps we'll see some sideways trading for a while until the market decides.
Yeah, the general fear of crashes since early February probably is a factor. Another factor is that many people already have bought decent dips. I think it's a smart move to just wait a bit and see where trends are going from here. Miners probably want it up to 10k soon so they are reluctant to sell too low, but the market is a bit shaken at the moment it appears. It should recover soon enough though within the coming weeks.
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:30:57
It's impossible to say with certainty. Though it might be helpful to check the charts for 2017, 2016 and backwards. While the past isn't an indicator of future prices, it's at least good to have comparisons in mind. Best of luck, whenever you decide to cash out.
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:50:26
Doubt anything over 11k within the coming weeks, but after mid April, who knows. I am positive long term.

It all depends on supply and demand so we can't know for sure, but bitcoin is deflationary and the supply is locked. The key factor therefore is demand. If adoption/demand rise, then price is likely to rise. If the deflationary quality of bitcoin is greater than the inflationary level of fiat currencies, then bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will also experience a general rise in price over time, in relation to fiat. It's hard to predict the future based on historical trends, but if the past is any hint, I think $30k is a modest figure in relation to its potential, at least if we project a few years ahead. Of course, it is always advisable to set up a worst-case scenario situation as well. I don't invest more than I am willing to lose. Risk vs potential gains. Inflation in fiat brings loss over time for holders of fiat. Bitcoin is one of many asset classes that may function as a hedge against inflation. Only the future can tell.

Sure, it's a good thing to sell a percentage of the investment at particular intervals, to secure gains. The tricky part is to find the best spot to re-invest some of the gains, but there will always be dips to catch. :)

When logged in at Cex.io, press the top tab "Finance", and you will see your various coin balances. For each coin there are buttons for "Deposit" and "Withdraw". If you wish to transfer, let's say, BTC to your Cex.io account, just click "Deposit" on the BTC row and you will be sent to a second page where you are asked to click in a small box that you agree with the conditions. After clicking to agree, the receiving address of your selected coin type is shown.
Once you have copied your receiving address and sent coins to it (double check that it is 100% correct; both the address and the type of coin), the transfer should be on its way soon after. The website will show a small pop-up when the transaction has gone through and you can also find the details in the top tab for transactions. As always, 6 confirmations of the transaction may take up to an hour, even though the coin balance at Cex.io should be updated within 10-15 minutes. I made a small test transfer the first time to see that everything worked out and that's what I would recommend on any exchange.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:35:49
In my humble opinion, bitcoin has been tested through trials by fire in the recent crashes this quarter. I would make a distinction between price and value though. Bitcoin doesn't need a particular price-range to be valuable, but those who wish to cash out to fiat are certainly affected by the drop in price, until they aren't.
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:49:54
I've had a blast today, quite the adrenaline rush, awesome work everyone!
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:19:13
I think it's safe to conclude that the recent crash has been far less severe, judging from objective factors, compared with the crash from ATH in December towards the final valley and bounce at 6th of February. This time Kobayashi hasn't sold off anything, and as far as we know the Mt Gox debt is more or less paid off.
(Credit to FlorianManner for posting the link here)
While the price of Bitcoin is still affected by fears from the recent crash, combined with fears of near future drops, I personally doubt to see a drop below $8000 at this point in time. At the moment a lot of potential buyers naturally want to wait and see where the final bottom occurs, which reduces the demand presently.
On the other hand of the spectrum we have bitcoin miners and potential sellers that expect a rise towards 10-11k levels within a week or the coming week. Considering the recent crash and the fears in the market they might have to settle for 9.5k presently even though they consider 10k+ to be a reasonable market price in a market that isn't affected by strong fears.
The question is then how low the sellers and miners are willing to go below their expected sale price. On the one hand, if they wait, the prices will eventually recover from the crash. On the other hand, if they need cash right away they might sell now if they fear a further drop.
If the market sellers expects a return to 10-11k levels within a foreseeable future, then every thousand dollars below this line is considered a substantial loss of potential revenue. This is why I don't expect to see prices below 8k at the moment; it may happen as a quick visit from sellers that need urgent cash, but a few exceptions won't dictate the price for long.
This is why I think that predictions of a price below 5.8k is wishful thinking: yes, I would love such low prices to accumulate more BTC, but I don't think there would be enough sellers that would consider that price range to be beneficial. Since 11k is a definite possibility in the coming weeks, only a fool would sell below the worst crash bitcoin has seen, from which it has recovered remarkably since then. Further drops may happen, but the question is how likely a particular drop is compared to expected sale prices.
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:18:54
Let's see. Bitcoin has increased its market dominance since the crash of February 6th from 35.89% to 45.02%. At the same time bcash has soared from 4.67% to 4.67%, pretty much at standstill while bitcoin has grown.
Ethereum has had it even worse and gone from 20.87% to 14.67%.

It's impossible to know for certain until things happen. For me, I'd rather make several decent trades than waiting for one super trade. If there's a huge unexpected drop, I have extra funds for that if it happens, I just don't wait for it.

Agreed. He probably doesn't realize that you can both hold and trade at the same time. Holding is a decent general advice especially for newcomers.

@_date: 2018-03-30 21:27:33
I can't really agree. A person who bought at 20k in December might have learned enough about the market a few months later in order to execute a sale + lower rebuy with decent timing. Not necessarily, but I wouldn't rule it out.
Also, what do you mean by not likely have worked out? It obviously can work, it's just not recommended since it comes with risks, and it will take a lot of time as well so you would need to do it when you have sufficient spare time such as during a weekend. That's one of the reasons why people recommend holding, at least until a person have proper experience.
@_date: 2018-03-24 12:54:55
This surely appear to be an interesting weekend. That was quite a bounce at 8.8k. Will be interesting to see how this plays out.
I keep my main BTC stack for holding, so if price goes up I earn money. Then I have a smaller stack of BTC for trading which I allow myself to go risky with. I think that by mid April, at least, we should have a decent upwards trend. Have a good weekend and best of luck.
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:52:56

If I was in a pool of short-traders then I might short, but I am not, so I won't take that risk. I sold at 7.8k and bought back at 6.9k, then made a minor misjudgement later on but overall I am on decent plus. Are you shorting now or waiting for better opportunity?

My partner is fine with it. She realizes that it's a hobby of mine and respects it as such. I don't invest more than I am willing to lose.
As an artist it's nice and handy to accept commissions in crypto. Sure there are risks with cryptocurrencies, but with bitcoin's 9 year track record and it's proved strength through the crash of February 6th, I feel more confident being in crypto than being left out.
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:48:15
Sounds fair. My apologies for lashing out. Just a dude at 40+ here with still much to learn in the field of cryptocurrencies. I wouldn't mind a slow and steady rise now, although I am sure there will be drops every now and then which will be absorbed by the market.
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:44:13
Using a 100 day chart is a common measurement. However, I would also consider that the measurement shown just happens to start at the peak of the ATH at 17th of December 2017, at which point it is commonly believed that bitcoin, as well as many altcoins, were inflated and overvalued, just before the market crash and correction towards the lowest low of 5.8k at 6th of February.
Since the lowest low after the ATH dropped to 5.8k, compared with $6874 presently (as of writing), I'd be more inclined to look for a chart that show raw BTC-USD prices. Swings of dollar purchase power over the course of a few months doesn't really have much to do with bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency. If the chart merely display BTC-USD prices, then I don't see why it would mention buying power.
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:24:59
Bought the dip recently at 7.8k. I think the price won't go much below the McAfee-line at the moment since it tends to bounce at 2.5% over it. I expect to see 9k within a week so that's an easy 15% profit just there. In a worst case scenare I would have to wait one or two more weeks. I could live with that. Apart from that, my main stack is for holding for the next 2-5 years so if the market turns sour for a while that wouldn't bother me.

Good article overall.
While the cartel theory is embarrassing in its conspiracy theory assumptions, I think it is also a terrible narrative from the outset. If certain people are eager to spread unfounded assumptions, such as the determined belief that bitcoin must be going down to zero, while giving some kind of all-powerful, hidden group of conspirators as a reason, I cannot for the life of me see how that perspective would somehow contribute to a positive, rational and healthy market.
Please nip it in the bud.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:55:18
The $1000 spike from 6.9k at 12th of April was likely a result of a large number of high leverage shorters being forced to close their shorts, i.e. buy back their loaned bitcoins as a result of misjudging the rapid market transition at the end of tax-season. Other factors certainly play in as well but that's my overall take. Then likely fomo kicked in as well for some, especially when they saw the price rush vertically upwards.
Bullrun market mechanics can often be surprising and sudden. If you combine bulls, traders setting up longs, bots trading and a hungry market with lowered sell pressure, shorters mass-closing their shorts, perhaps add some fomo; these are all ingredients where spikes just may happen.
Market manipulation exist, especially in a non-regulated market such as bitcoin, it's just hard to extrapolate from the price movement. There are a host of different types of whales, traders and bots doing their own thing, resulting in a price terrain that is sometimes surprising.
I was skeptical of the fast price recovery as well, made a poor decision sell with my trading stack and then fomo'ed back in when I realized that the upwards trajectory was steady enough over time. The bear market had gotten to me a bit I have to admit. After buying back I could again enjoy the price increase. While we don't know how far the price altitude will go this time, I'll at least be more careful when considering crossing heavy bull terrain next time.

It doesn't matter. She didn't experience the technological boom of the 90'ies and onward so she wouldn't have similar frames of reference, and besides, I doubt that she would see much of a point regarding affirmations of approval. Just pursue your own rational self interests. Bitcoin isn't intrinsically involved with that, unless you decide it is. No approval necessary.
If you enjoyed the writings of Ayn Rand you might find Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics interesting as well since she was quite influenced by parts of his works.

I am considering that perhaps bulls were merely consolidating liquidity during the previous $100 upwards pump + dump, since they didn't attempt to defend the gains. Could be interesting. If 9.2k holds, possibly a good sign, if it doesn't, back to 8.8k perhaps.
[EDIT] I know that some bulls out there have been doing great. If it turns out that you don't have sufficient backing at 9.2k then that's not your fault. If you get backing, then let's hope that backing sticks for a while. The sell pressure has been a bit hard lately at these levels.

While I disagree with his opinions on bitcoin I think he's a brilliant investor in his particular field. He admits that he doesn't understand bitcoin and that he only invest in companies that he has a firm grasp of.

We already have great examples of artificial intelligence running most governments, except, they are 100% human and the definition of intelligence need to be broad enough to cover some overlaps with our closest living primate relatives. It is said that we have already achieved dominance over the banana, but not over the lab-mice, since the latter happen to be extra-dimensional travelers while the banana is a tasty fruit.

I think he intended to calculate the fees per average redditor, since his sum would just go over 8 bitcoin. However I agree that I am not really understanding his point either. I think he's trying to say that people shouldn't sell because of fees, which isn't a particularly good argument.
The reason why I don't intend on selling my trading stack is because I expect much better prices, at least I am curious to see where the highest peak will occur and from reading the market I think there's still a good amount upwards until then. In addition I keep my holding stack for long-term investment. Fees doesn't provide a problem unless people are scalping small trade ranges, which during a bullish terrain is quite difficult and risky.
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:02:34
No problem. The purchase power is pretty strong at 6.6k - 6.7k so if I were you I would at least wait and see. Supply and demand will guide the price discovery. Conspiracies can be entertaining at times but the motive behind is often fear or a desire to profit from a particular narrative.

Even bullish whales probably have to wait until after the selling pressure of the tax season has decreased in order to have success with any lasting pumps. Right now they are pumping and dumping for small short term profit since the market isn't ready for either a substantial increase or decrease. Mid-April towards July should bring a more positive terrain for higher price altitudes in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-04-08 08:55:12
It was a decent listen to go with a cup of coffee.
As always, people have placed their bets in various directions and will react depending on where they wish the market to go in the near future. If they are planning on shorting they will be naturally negative towards positive outlooks and vice versa if they are setting up longs.
As for me, I think the market needs to wait out the hardest sell pressure before we can have a decent upwards trajectory. There will be dips and all standard features as always. I'll go for patience and let the most eager sellers sell at suboptimal prices.

If someone is dumping BTC on the market it isn't likely connected to Mt Gox. How do I know that these addresses really belong to Mt Gox? I don't. Someone merely claims they do.
If you want to read about facts regarding the Mt Gox bankrupcty, I'd suggest to head here:
So no, for anyone with the ability to read and understand it is not likely that the Mt Gox trustee will sell any of the remaining coins. What would be the purpose when the claims were already covered in full and when a civil rehabilitation will be decided upon in September. If he sells BTC and BCH at this point then it would be a bit hard for him to distribute them among their owners in case of a CR.
I am sure that some whale has been dumping BTC on the market, I just don't think Mt Gox is involved.

I hold with my main stack and trade with a smaller stack, so if price goes up I make most profit and then I have some general fun with the trading stack in regards to fluctuations.

Although to be fair, as long as 8.7k-8.8k holds, if we drop back there, the general upwards trend is still fine. It's possible that the sell pressure has just been too strong for a while at this price altitude.

@_date: 2018-04-26 15:22:51
I suspect it was more of a slow strategic retreat back to more favorable price altitudes, due to excessive selling pressure.
Let the sellers sell at a level that favor bulls, no reason to give sellers extra bucks for coins that they appear to be intent on selling anyway. While pursuing sideways trading I wouldn't be surprised if bulls keep selling high and buying back low repeatedly in order to increase liquidity for further advances. They are investors and traders as well and need to make up for the cost of protecting price ranges.
Personally I appreciate the work of the bulls, they have endured a tough sell pressure lately and they also cannot risk to overextend themselves for the long run. So no, I don't consider bulls sitting on their arses.

The best trading in my opinion is when you wake up in the morning and find a great opportunity from your last trade a week ago, without having had to spend a minute following the market or experience any of the risks of daytrading. Best wishes.

I don't understand the negativity against this post. We have seen more or less constant negative posts where people claimed at 6.8k that we will never see 7k again (multiple times when we have dipped below 7k), that 3k-5k is certain in short timeframe, week after week. At least a positive post is somewhat of a trend change since they don't happen that often during this bear market.
Back to topic. I am positive but still think that the selling pressure during tax season will keep strong for a while. Sometime between Mid-April to July should see some really interesting development if I compare with previous years. Within the coming 24 hours I wouldn't be surprised to see prices between 7.2k - 7.8k, I just don't know how long that price altitude would last. Then there's always the possibility that we might not breach 7.2k this time. While there are some rich whales around with plenty of cash, their poker game is a tough read.

Right, could be a false signal, but I'd stay alert anyway since I saw a whale flashing a stack of 200 bitcoin in the bids at Bitfinex for a second. Sometimes this is a bluff, sometimes it is shown before a bullrun. Hard to know.
I would interpret it somewhere along these lines: "I understand that you might want to short at this point. My suggestion is for you to consider it very hard, because just maybe, we are a bit hungry today. I could be bluffing, but are you feeling lucky today, right now?"

Right, that's the independence factor which puts people into the autism spectrum even though we don't memorize meaningless strings of numbers or see crazy patterns everywhere. If you are used to focus on details and analyzing structures this benefits you in many lines of work.

Hard to tell. If we drop below 8k without a strong support then yes, at that point I would consider that there may be a new market cycle starting from a floor at 6.8k - 7.2k. If instead the price recovers over 9k with positive upwards momentum then I think there's a good chance at a higher peak, between 10.2k - 11.8k.
@_date: 2018-04-08 12:01:33
That's true. Although for every new fork, there will be an increasing competition for the forks to gain market cap percentages. Also when the number of forks increase, people may react by paying less attention to an increasing number of competitors.

Nope. If someone dumps BTC on the market, it's not the Mt Gox trustee. If you had done proper research you would know that the court will decide on a possible civil rehab in September and he wouldn't be allowed to touch the bankruptcy BTC and BCH addresses before that. The bankruptcy claims were paid in full from sales of BTC and BCH prior to early March so I doubt that he would decide to cross the court and the plaintiffs. You understand that a civil rehabilitation might result in the remaining coins being distributed among their rightful owners, right? And how would that be accomplished if he sells them without permission?

@_date: 2018-04-01 09:39:55
Right. In the area under 6.9k there appear to be more buying pressure than selling pressure. Will be interesting to see 6.7k being tested again soon. [EDIT] Yup, we're past 6.7k. So far.
Within a few minutes, selling pressure at 6.9k has lowered while buying pressure at 6.7k has increased, is a decent sign for short term progress. Also the volume has been picking up a bit, not perfectly yet but it's a clear improvement.
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:06:22
Right. Then you have whales working together on the other spectrum, seeing benefit in pumping up the price, whose behavior will disrupt bear-traders and shorters, making them less confident and causing them to incur losses. Sure, the bullish whales are not saints, they will sell for profit later, either parts or all of it if they are not holders, but at the end of the day whales are not a uniform group with a particular agenda. Rational self interest can explain most trading behaviors.
When people let conspiracies enter their thinking they start to panic sell, without basis in objective criteria, which may contribute to escalate a price fall which they oppose. Better to observe the market, be aware of risks, take precautions with long-term goals in sight and without stressing.
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:21:14
Not so strange. Alts tend to pump before bitcoin pumps. If you are a whale, you buy the alts first, then pump up bitcoin. If you do it the other way around you'll have to pay more for those alts. The alts doesn't affect bitcoin upwards, but the reverse is true. I'll never be a whale but it's logical enough. :\)

@_date: 2018-04-07 07:30:45
While I agree, I'd say that your point is just as valid if bitcoin merely regains a price altitude of 10k+ in July, which would be less drastic but still represent a 46% increase from today's price ($6850 as of writing). We have already seen bitcoin recover from 6k to 12k within a few weeks not that long ago. Though the past is not a metric that can foretell the future it shows that the potential is there, within reasonable range.
Another strategy is to wait for even lower prices. Personally I bought some more recently at 6.7k based on my observations since I started with bitcoin after the crash in early February. If that turns out to be a good or sub-optimal purchase only time will tell. If people wait for 6k and it happens then congratulations to them. I have more fiat in reserve to invest in case we see lower floors, although I don't invest more than I am willing to lose.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:16:30
To be honest, I won't really have confidence in any sudden pumps right now. I'd rather see some stabilization at a point where the price can be defended properly. First we need to test where the floor is.
If sellers are so eager to sell, let them sell plenty at sub 9k, then we might ascend again with less sell pressure.

Aye, the Greeks of that time are all dead by now, but their deeds are alive, especially the deeds of the bravest who died at Thermopylae.
The Greeks had evacuated Athens by the time the armies of Xerxes approached. The battle of Thermopylae was lost, with even more severe losses for the Persians. Xerxes' naval armada was then crushed at Salamis and he was forced to retreat with his starved armies without his desired spoils. Athens survived and grew in power. The brave warriors that died were heroes for centuries.
No relation to bitcoin whatsoever, it just didn't end the way you imagined. The Spartans valued bravery, fame and battle over life itself. Since all men die, they sought to leave the world with impact. And they did. They certainly didn't die impotent from old age and ill health. They were not remembered for going silent into the night.

@_date: 2018-04-08 11:23:01
I think the general cue given is that the bulls should walk slowly towards the goal/s instead of sprinting in order to preserve energy and liquidity. :) Possibly selling at strategic peaks to gain extra liquidity and let the price sink a bit before another upwards climb. If the selling pressure is still too strong then the bulls will have to wait for a better opportunity. Both bulls and bears appear to be continuously testing the waters for either direction.
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:16:53
The market has been hard to read lately and while I don't want to speculate on particular price levels right now, I would be careful to bet on dropping prices. It may happen, we just don't know the likelihood and it would be a pure gamble. Not all cards are on the table and the market is still in recovery mode. Unexpected bullruns can show up instantly and reverse a drop when people expect the market to sink.
Those that have already sold without exiting the market will generally predict low prices with absolute certainty since they seek to re-enter at a lower price with profit. This is understandable. However, when people make dead certain predictions like that, I tend to call bluff. A more nuanced observation is generally more realistic.

Some whales will be bluffing in the orderbooks but overall there have been some great poker-game quality action with interesting fall-reversals and odd tricks.

Taxation effectively means that citizens agree, generally under threat of fines and prison, to work for free for the state during a certain amount of months each year.
Taxes in themselves isn't the main problem in my opinion, but rather the lack of accountability from the government and the larger governmental bureaucracy combined with the state setting different standards for different citizens.
A couple of problems:
1. Citizens being double taxed. Double and hidden taxes simply add to the number of months and weeks you are working for free for the state. Double taxation has nothing to do with paying for firefighters and hospitals, which could be funded by regular tax, but has everything to do with state greed and forced financial redistribution.
2. Progressive taxation. This is where you are taxed at a higher rate the more you earn; i.e. the same standards of taxation does not apply to all citizens. When you evaluate how many months you work for free for the state, progressive taxation causes you to have to work extra weeks or months for free compared with your neighbor. Add the fact that the wealthiest will have great enough lawyers to pay the absolute minimum.
B-b-but the rich has more money and can survive being taxed more! Look, it doesn't matter if the state can technically tax the rich more; they will move their asses, assets or both if they feel taken advantage of or restricted in their investments. Even worse, when the state strikes particular deals with the wealthiest companies in order to have them stay in spite of a high tax pressure, competition is effectively undermined by the state setting different requirements for different companies.
If you have some amount of success from your investments of your already taxed income, then why should the state, who never backed you in your risks and hard work, be *that* business partner who only appears when there is profit to be reaped from your risks and then leave. If you suffer setbacks later, the state effectively robbed you of your hard earned margins. While losses can often be tax deductible, the state still screws up your investment plans.
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:55:16
Agreement is a tricky subject and the manufacture of consent is a subject of study since at least the late 1920'ies. Basically consent to a state relies on propaganda combined with the carrot and stick. Though yes, the state is allowed to rob you since its citizens gives it the power to dictate its own terms. This will probably continue as long as the practice is accepted by the vast majority of voters.
@_date: 2018-04-02 10:58:18
I would be careful with selling at this point if the goal is to re-enter at a lower price. Sure, you might luck out, but you also might not. If you sell for profit and don't plan to buy in again then that would be a different matter.
The market is different at this point than when we had a continuous downtrend. There is much more confidence and buying pressure at this level and point in time. I wouldn't be surprised to see occasional sudden spikes, which have already happened a couple of times, even during the night when everyone thought the buying volumes were low.
While sudden drops could happen, they might also be cancelled out by quick bullruns, resulting in squeezing shorters and bears. A higher price altitude would be a safer terrain for those that plan on selling and re-entering at a lower price point. Plus, better margins for gains.
After the worst crash this year to 6k at February 6th, we didn't see the 7k level again for weeks after the market had recovered and passed that price point. This doesn't mean that we can't see a worsening of the market, I just wouldn't bet on it.
This is merely my humble opinion. Stay safe and avoid risky bets.

When buying altcoins, one strategy is to wait until bitcoin hits a solid rock bottom floor, which last time was around $6600, knowing that once bitcoin rises there will be enough market confidence and expectations that many altcoins will go up with bitcoin.
The reason why several altcoins suffer right now is because people bought them at a far lower price (see my previous section) and are selling them for profit. Same thing happens to bitcoin as well at levels where the sell pressure is high, which is especially understandable after a bearish period. However, since bitcoin will likely keep going up and pass at least 10k-11k, altcoins should recover gradually depending on their respective sell pressure.
If bitcoin experience huge drops at some point that is breaking the positive bull momentum, without being able to hold proper ground, then that's when you will likely see a major sell-off of altcurrencies.
Due to these mechanics, bitcoin tend to increase its market cap percentage when it drops sharply and comes nearer to a solid floor, as a result of people selling altcoins and consolidating in bitcoin, while bitcoin loses some of its market cap percentage when the price is going up and you have bull terrain momentum, since then traders have more confidence in diversifying in alts. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:06:54
This is a decision you will have to make for yourself. It's up to you to evaluate if you think the long term prospects of bitcoin is worth it.
There's nothing wrong with taking out profits for yourself when you think that the price has reached a proper level. Like others have said, this will also be dependent on your private economy.
Study the fundamentals of bitcoin and make up your mind based on your evaluation of the value of the technology and where you think it is going to be 1-5 years from now. If you prefer to consider more immediate perspectives, then cashing out at a time when you have a profit, such as now, could be a good and safe strategy.
Personally I think that bitcoin is worth more than the current price at 8k. The recent bounces at 6k, 6.4k and 6.6k, in my opinion give decent indications that the market considers bitcoin sufficiently undervalued at those levels to merit a strong buying pressure. However, I could be wrong and don't take my opinions as financial advice; cryptocurrency markets can change for the better or worse in a short period of time.
I prefer to keep my investments in bitcoin for the coming 2-5 years, but that's just because I have confidence in the fundamentals, have no need for that cash right now combined with the fact that I don't invest more than I am willing to lose.
Stay safe with your economy and don't take unnecessary risks.
@_date: 2018-04-26 07:33:26
8.8k is an important support level and shouldn't be treated lightly. Many traders who sold at 9.7k are looking to buy back in at a point where they see a reliable stabilizing of price and proper rebound. A $900 drop is a decent profit in a short span of time.
The recent drops have been reduced in strength and personally I wouldn't sell at 8.8k since it is a potential price altitude for buybacks. Once a bottom is perceived to be confirmed there will be a rebound. Don't sell at the bottom. If this isn't the bottom, then I would suggest to at least wait and evaluate the situation before making any drastic decisions. And yes, some might say that the recent drop to 8.7k was the bottom, perhaps it was, we'll see.

I wouldn't go that far.
If the data is correct, it shows that during each year there were a host of factors influencing the price of bitcoin, resulting in this set of data. Some of those factors may be 'relatively' recurring ones, others may be unique for that particular year and/or month. Alas we cannot separate and identify the underlying influences from merely looking at the set of data.
When an array of factors are considered, I think there is value in also considering past performance and patterns, with a critical mind, as long as one prioritize more critical and recent factors.

And especially, thanks for all the bullish fish!
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:18:56
Right. Once the most urgent sell pressure has blown off its steam sufficiently at 8.7k - 9k, the continued climb should be easier. Then 9.2k will be the next major barrier, unless we skip it with a bullrun. If the momentum is positive enough most sellers don't mind to raise their sale prices.
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:58:23
Sorry, I wasn't able to follow completely. Bitcoin went up from 6.6k to 9.7k, then it recently fell down to 8.7k - 8.8k, with most major alts mirroring its price movement fairly well. I guess down depends on when you bought in. For me it's still up about 28-30%.
Sure, there have been a tough sell pressure from some whales since the price reached 9.7k. On the flip side, other whales, combined with some bulls have defended the 8.7-8.8k price range for a while in spite of heavy pressure. There are many interests at play in the market.

Sorry sir, that response doesn't check out on my plausibility screen. There's a difference between presenting an honest, nuanced speculation, and preaching absolute deterministic outcomes for the future.
@_date: 2018-04-01 23:52:35
There are several trends existing simultaneously. If you combine a congregate of factors and trends then you get a complex picture of potential outcomes, both upwards and downwards.
The further down the price goes, the stronger the buying pressure becomes since traders will consider the price increasingly undervalued below certain ranges. That's why it's difficult to predict price drops below levels that are known, where we have observed strong bounces already, since the terrain below that bounce is uncharted in regards to the buying pressure.
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:21:56

Sorry man, I don't buy that analysis.
And to be honest, I am not sure if I understand what you meant.
My observation has been that to the contrary, there have been strong buying pressure at 6.8k-6.9k even though the wealthy buyers could have easily let the price sink down to 6.7k if they had wanted and therefore had a better bargain. So I'd rather say that there appear to be some whales actively keeping the price over 6.7k at the moment and since some time, which may indicate that they are bullish in the near future. This doesn't however mean that the same whales won't cash out at a particular price altitude and it also doesn't imply that a particular price direction will occur by necessity.
@_date: 2018-04-08 11:39:56
Right. There might be some exception such as Litecoin that have slightly increased its market cap percentage during the recent trials by fire, but it's still not handling the stress anywhere near comparable with bitcoin, where bitcoin's market cap percentage has significantly improved since the crash at early February.

My reading at 7.8k was that the volume was too low at that time, combined with a high sell pressure, so I sold and bought back at 6.9k. At that point I didn't want to risk anything since the purchase pressure and volume rose a bit. Then I purchased some more at 6.6k and now recently again after the last bounce. Good for you to have read the market properly, but it's definitely a hard read at times so don't expect everyone to arrive at the same conclusion. There will always be passion(TM) involved.
It appears that we have a decent rebound now towards 7k. While 6.7k might be tested a few times it looks like the purchase mood is pretty strong at the moment. Might see some 6.7k sideways action for a while.

I think you are lacking in nuances.
My starting point is the observation that several different trendlines exist simultaneously. The trendline from 20k is a relevant one, but it's hardly the only available.
Bitcoin's real test under stress in my opinion is found when you remove the hype bubble prices of 20k and measure from the lowest point and bounce after the crash to 6k, which happened at February 6th. If you combine several relevant trendlines you will arrive at a more thorough and less onesided analysis.
My observation is that the trends since February 6th have been complex, though bitcoin has shown an interesting degree of recovery from the last series of crashes in an unregulated market. While bitcoin still hasn't fully recovered from the recent crash and bounce at 6.4k, we haven't seen a repetition of the worst low of the year yet, albeit the price hang fairly close.

@_date: 2018-04-01 09:55:54
Wouldn't surprise me. I have seen plenty of purchases of 10 and 12 bitcoin recently so there definitely appear to be positive moods regarding these sub-7k prices. I bought some more at 6.6k while it lasted, just after the bounce. While opportunities may return, they also may not. Mid-April should get some good steam going.
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:13:34
I'd say that it's a possibility that we'll see 6.6k-6.8k whenever the current peak is discovered. After that point however it's far harder to make certain predictions. Also there may be some surprises along the way since whales generally enjoy disrupting past patterns. Just don't be too comfortable in your certainties.

I'd say it's hard to tell. During the last ten minutes the purchase volume has increased a bit so I would be a bit careful regarding rash decisions. You could be right, I just wouldn't bet on it. There have been several traps/surprises today so far.
At least nobody can call bitcoin boring at the moment.

Man, quit that cartel talk stuff. It's causing more negativity than it solves. The market is what it is, whales and traders buy and sell when they think they will profit from it. Get over it.

Could be a bluff, but I recently saw 6893 bitcoin on the sell side of Bitfinex. Even if it is mainly shorts, it is possible that bulls might have to retreat a bit to a lower price point. I could be wrong, both sides tend to bluff, I would just be extra careful out there.

I could be wrong, but since the recent crash I have seen quite a few beartraps where shorters have been squeezed. To me it appears planned. If some of the most obsessed shorters are economically damaged through a series of clever traps, this would certainly improve the price recovery for bitcoin. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate shorters and margin traders. But shorting at low price levels and hoping for a complete crash just isn't a healthy mindset, and there will be risks with such behavior.

But why should I expect others to be concerned?
If I wasn't confident in bitcoin on a long-term basis I wouldn't have invested in the first place. I don't rule out the possibility that I could be wrong, that bitcoin might become worth less, or more over time than I presently expect. I am prepared to accept both outcomes in case they should happen at some point in time.

Possibly you are right. Personally I suspect that some of the more extreme shorters work in pools in order to provide security and extra liquidity. While their tactics probably worked fine at higher price altitudes, they have stumbled upon more uncertain terrain down here. This lower terrain is native bullground and it takes balls, or overblown confidence, to bet on dropping prices when another bullrun may be around the corner.

First, I haven't seen any evidence that those addresses are linked to Mt Gox so far.
Secondly, it is highly unlikely that the Mt Gox trustee would sell any remaining BTC or BCH since the claims were paid in full from sales prior to early March this year. In September the court will decide if there will be a civil rehabilitation, i.e. distribution of the remaining coins to the creditors.
If any coins were moved from legitimate Mt Gox address, then I'd assume that would be for purposes of consolidation.
Personally I think that webpage is sketchy, it has annoying ads and the purpose of spamming links to it is likely to generate money from traffic. The owner claims to have been banned from the only serious subreddit regarding Mt Gox, so no, that doesn't make him any more credible, rather the opposite.
Here's what we know so far on Mt Gox:

Best wishes with your decision.
When I went into bitcoin I set up some basic parameters for myself with a perspective of at least 2-5 years into the future, potentially 10 years depending on the development. Since I haven't invested more than I am willing to lose I would be ok if bitcoin went to zero. Yes, that's honestly true. Although, I doubt that would happen since I have confidence in my observations and judgement. I don't make a bet unless I am willing to take the risk of loss.
Personally I'd rather risk the volatility of crypto than the inevitable inflation of fiat or some of the fiat-pumped stocks, which have their own volatility. If my investments turn out to be flawed then I am willing to accept my losses, reevaluate my judgement and move on. However, if bitcoin rises over the course of time and I didn't invest - contrary to my judgement - I would feel regret. As long as people follow their own judgement, their decisions will prove to be either correct or incorrect over time. I intend to follow my own mind with the responsibilities, risks and potentials involved.

There are times when it can be profitable to sell and rebuy at a lower price, I just think that the market is too hard to read at the moment for it to be worth the risk. I sold at 7.8k and rebought at 6.9k, then bought more at 6.6k after the bounce. Feel free to take risks, I would personally wait for higher altitudes before I took a chance. Don't let conspiracies get to you. Observe the market over time and adapt, just don't let people cause you to feel panic.

Not sure if I follow. When bitcoin crashes, many of the altcurrencies crash even harder and show less signs recovery, possibly because people consolidate in bitcoin during crashes. Litecoin is one of few top-chart altcoins that have improved its market cap together with bitcoin since Februrary 6th, but that's more of an anomaly in comparison with many other alts.

Buying volumes are a bit down so it's possible that we might see some drops. If that happens I would expect bounces at 6.6k - 6.7k.

@_date: 2018-04-14 19:37:46
That's a possibility. On the other hand there are also a lot of sellers that have waited weeks to sell at 8.2k-9k, which means that the buying pressure will need to be tested against the selling pressure and regarding this it's a bit early to forecast what happens above the 8.2k range at this point in time. If bitcoin doesn't push past 8.2k within the coming days then there is the possibility that it might revisit the 7.5k-7.8k range.
The buying pressure has been strong for the last two days since the 'great spike' from $6.8k, however, I trust a slower climb more than a sudden elevator, and while I expected a recovery the coming days and weeks, the acuteness of the angle of that rise was a surprise. As for bullish sentiments the overall confidence levels have increased dramatically; even if the price were to fall a few hundred dollars due to temporary high sell pressure, the price would likely bounce back up relatively soon, or at least stabilize and then trend upwards. I don't see sub 7k prices coming back anytime soon.
Looking at the market depth, there are some trader expectations of purchase orders at 7.5k, which may be in the wishful thinking territory at this point in time, I just wouldn't rule that possibility out completely.
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:41:22
Right. Plus, when whales play poker they keep most of their cards hidden.
After a crash, some whales have a tendency to buy low, sell at a chosen high point, wait for the price to drop and then push up again with force to a new higher peak, confusing the market with a sudden burst that catches people off-guard when they were thinking the price was dropping.
When whales battle, the smaller fish, such as most of us, may want to wait out the results before making drastic, rash decisions. Small fish like myself tend to have better odds at higher altitudes where the market is generally easier to read.
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:13:17
My impression is that the difference is like night and day. At 8k the price had fallen steadily since 9k without much resistance and the volumes were much, much lower than now with far less visible purchase power. Probably many traders wanted prices sub 7k levels and felt no reason to rebuy until it dropped deep enough. At this present point, I'd be more careful with taking risks. The bounces over 6.6k have been strong and happened in the blink of an eye, which is not the kind of signals I would appreciate if I wanted to sell or short.
@_date: 2018-04-02 00:51:59
The price falls as a result of eager sellers, combined with the fact that there isn't sufficient buying pressure to counter the selling pressure. A weak buying pressure contributes to the fall but it is the eagerness of the sellers, who are bidding below each other in order to sell, that causes the actual fall. The selling volumes also have to outperform the buying volumes.
The buying pressure increases the more undervalued the price is considered, at least below a particular point. This is what eventually stops the price from falling and results in a bounce. Though if we are considering particular assets that are not expected to recover properly, then it is not given that the buying pressure will increase much as the price drops, if there isn't enough confidence that the asset will recover and pay off within an expected timeframe.
@_date: 2018-04-08 08:34:02
Price goes up when buyers are eager to outbid each other upwards, and it goes down when sellers are eager to outbid each other downwards. Then the buying volume has to outperform the selling volume for upwards movement and vice versa.
Since most sellers want to maximize their profit they will wait as long as they deem possible before selling in order to achieve a price level that they consider optimal for the moment. This is where FUD comes in, since it is a tool for telling newcomers that the price will not have a chance of recovering and that sellers should accept selling at a suboptimal price, for the benefit of bearish traders who need extra sell pressure in order to maximize profit from their shorts and then be able to buy back at the next floor. If that new lower floor doesn't materialize and price goes up instead they will have to buy back their shorts at a loss.
Most people that give a price analysis generally have a stake in the game and normally won't predict a price movement which doesn't benefit them. That's why I prefer to read nuanced predictions that account for both upward and downward possibilities, as long as one keeps in mind biases.

@_date: 2018-04-02 10:45:23
I would be careful with selling at this point if the goal is to re-enter at a lower price. Sure, you might luck out, but you also might not. If you sell for profit and don't plan to buy in again then that would be a different matter.
The market is different at this point than when we had a continuous downtrend. There is much more confidence and buying pressure at this level. I wouldn't be surprised to see occasional sudden spikes, which have already happened a couple of times, even during the night when everyone thought the buying volumes were low.
While sudden drops could happen, they might also be cancelled out by quick bullruns, resulting in squeezing shorters and bears. A higher price altitude would be a safer terrain for those that plan on selling and re-entering at a lower price point. 
Just my humble opinion. Stay safe and avoid risky bets.
@_date: 2018-04-07 12:59:12
Counter people's points instead of obsessing about their looks and/or clothes.
Personally I am not a fan of Roger Ver but overall I like the fact that the host invited a variety of individuals with different perspectives.
Regarding Bcash and its market cap, it has performed negatively since the crash at February 6th, while bitcoin and litecoin (to a lighter degree) have improved their respective market caps, even while prices have dropped significantly. Ethereum has been worst off among the top altcoins during this period and has seen the least recovery in terms of market cap. I wouldn't put too much hope in the idea that altcoins will improve if bitcoin falls enough, since people owning alts tend to consolidate into bitcoin when cryptos are down.
The "bitcoin core" narrative of Roger Ver is getting tedious and doesn't improve my view of Bcash at all.
@_date: 2018-04-26 07:58:21
Looking at recent months there are several situations where the price have rebounded after a fall like this and surpassed the first 'top'. There are multiple potential outcomes at this stage and I wouldn't be dead sure on any one of them. My general rule of thumb is to not trade until I feel confident that it won't backfire, which generally means to wait and monitor any potential changes in trends and price terrain.
Oftentimes, just stepping back from the market for hours or days may present a better trading opportunity. Bitcoin will have its ups and downs and won't go anywhere soon. If in doubt, there will always be better situations ahead.

@_date: 2018-04-07 14:41:52
Surprise for you then since the market cap percentage of bitcoin has improved since the lowest low this year at February 6th, even after several subsequent crashes. During this period bitcoin's market cap percentage has gone from 36.4% to 45.18%. While you could also measure from the top of the ATH, we don't know to what extent bitcoin was inflated at that point. After the bounce at 6k back then at least we have some type of signal that a floor was hit. It may not be any final floor by far, but so far it's been the lowest this year.
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:19:33
You said the price would drop drastically during the night and it didn't happen. Sure, I have made incorrect predictions myself many times, that happens.

Was there some type of point or argument that you wanted to make here?
@_date: 2018-04-15 05:59:44
Same here, I bought back with my trading stack because the buying pressure is still going strong and we are trending towards 8.2k in a steady upwards climb. The market depth has shifted upwards during the last hour and the drops have been less and less severe. While we might have some sideways action for some time, the period between mid-April towards July has historically been positive, so I personally don't want to miss out on that potential opportunity.
We still need to probe the 8.2k-9k area, but it's possible that sellers catch up on the positive momentum and decide they might get a better sale price if they wait and sell at a higher price altitude, especially if we don't go below 8k-7.9k anytime soon. Still, the sell pressure over 8.2k is still relatively unknown so smaller dips at that point may happen. But considering the slow, steady climb right now, perhaps the crossing will be less eventful than I had expected.
At this point it appears to me that the new pricerange at around 8k has been tested and proven to hold, I was a bit skeptical at first after that first initial bullrun climb from sub 7k to 8k. When I zoom out at the 30 minute range, I don't want to end up on the wrong side of that slow trending climb.
