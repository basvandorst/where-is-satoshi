Happy cake day! Do you feel like it's a special day?

What? I didn't realize the CAD had fallen that much.

And it worked for you? Yes,I downloaded that zip file, extracted the files and copied them to a usb stick.

I had tails on DVD but the bitaddress files were on a writable stick. But maybe it did need to be able to write to the tails folders for some reason. Thanks.

I had to change to legacy boot mode before it would even work. I've considered trezor. I hate to shell out the money but it might be worth it. People say to get another computer and never connect it to the internet, well, that would cost as much as a trezor.

I want some of what you're on. Good story, man.

Nice! Good luck!

Tell me about this new firmware, maybe I'll wait for that before I order one.
@_date: 2016-01-09 21:50:40
I'll try that, thanks.

Yeah, I played with that too. It gave me my long phrase then said I would have to go online to complete the process. I guess that would work too, I just didn't finish with it.

I'm curious why the shippers do it. They end up paying an effective rate of $500-600 per btc.

6-7 times the cost actually. Trezor is $109 shipped, Hw.1 is $16 shipped (to the US anyway).
