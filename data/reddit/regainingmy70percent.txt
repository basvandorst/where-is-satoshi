He made a bid on a whole resort complex but a competing bid came in last minute and he didn’t get the entire resort, just the casinos.  In the time it took to the parties to negotiate the splitting the casino and resort the bond market moved dramatically and the interest he had to pay on the bonds was much higher. This is why he keeps saying you have to walk if you don’t get the deal.

I go long and short during sideways action with a stop loss on both. Usually one stop-loss locks in a gain and the other get to run.  Usually the longer the sideways action the more dramatic the price movement after.

The floor has been trending down, and the highs have been lower. I'm hoping the price goes up, but Im shorting when the indicator turns red and longing when it turns green.

Its an Exchange Traded Fund; which means that a company will but a bunch or stocks, or gold, bitcoin, etc. The fund trades on an exchange like a stock. Most follow change in value in proportion to the investments inside. GBTC is similar, but its been more expensive than the underyling BTC in the folio. I have it in my Roth at Fidelity. That way if it moons I don't have to pay taxes on it. Lord willing it will moon, and I 72-t the account and the increase in bitcoin will mean that my RMDs will barely be able to spend down the account. Take the RMDs before it looks like its going to tank
@_date: 2018-07-20 15:39:35
$GBTC is an stock market invest-able vehicle for bitcoin. RMD refers to the required minimum distribution you have to take from retirement accounts. You can retire before 59.5 so long as you commit to taking withdrawals every year.

Bitcoin is the standard, like brent crude, that everyone refers to.  When bitcoin is doing well, money will flow from alts and alts will then decline. But then crypto is doing well because bitcoin is doing well, alts appreciate.  The reverse is also true. Bitcoin dumps and alts will shoot up as people flee bitcoin, but then they decline because bitcoin is declining.

TA is very effective in crypto for two reasons. First there is no 10 K or other government reports so it’s an experiment and mass psychology painted across candles.
