Sure.  I wanted to get something out first.  Previews are definitely high on my list of things to integrate soon.  
Could be right about the tweet, I was thinking if an artist *you know* is going to release something new it could come into play.  Previews make tons of sense there as well. 
I'll set up a roadmap of where I'm thinking of taking the service soon.
Appreciate the feedback.

Hey - Gotta be on my end.  What browser/operating system are you using?  
Edit: I can recreate using safari - not sure how I missed it - will fix and let you know.
Edit 2: Just pushed a hotfix: should work now.  If not, shoot me an email at support and we can discuss more.  Thanks for bringing this to my attention.

Hello.  Yesterday I launched   It's in very early stages.  While it's functionality is not nearly the scope that you describe, I'm working to make it better every day and considering the wants of the community. 
First Up - Audio Previews, which is pretty necessary, I'll admit.  
There are tons of challenges in trying to compete with the big boys - Spotify, Soundcloud, Bandcamp.  A lot of competition as well.
But I'm definitely interested in pursuing different ideas.  I'm also a rapper/musician, so I would love to develop tools that actually help independent musicians.  
Got a link to your music?
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:29:22

What's stopping someone from doing that from another service? You can rip music from Soundcloud, Bandcamp, etc very easy.

The more and more I talk to music fans, I realize they do value music - they do want to see musicians get paid fairly for their work - but Spotify et. al. is just so damn easy to use and access.

You're probably 3-4 time zones away from me.  Either way, looking into it - appreciate the update.

Probably an API.  
I was using a service similar to this one a little while back.  About a month ago they just bounced.
Your site looks much nicer, but honestly, you should run an alpha and promote like hell.  I think the more people using the service, the more appealing it becomes to others.

@_date: 2014-09-04 19:57:56
"And will debut it when it is more mature..." 
So no, it was never a 'former policy' as your title suggested.  
It would be a disastrous business decision for Circle to reset account balances to the USD value of BTC when purchased.  
I assume this would be an opt-in feature and your funds would be static from there onward. 
@_date: 2013-05-05 14:07:58
Ok great.  This is something the community needs, as CoinDL is slowwwwww and openbitcoinstore is extremely heavy for many uses.
@_date: 2013-05-06 22:00:34
Yeah and it became more and more 'idiot-friendly'.  Not the same as 'idiot-proof' of course, but I still think people should strive to make it not "just for geeks" (even if you disagree, think of it as a sliding scale not a dichotomy) instead of laughing at people who think the entry barrier is a little much right now.  
Remember Hotline?  How much easier are torrents compared to that...

This is 101 type shit.  Unbelievable.  
@_date: 2013-05-05 14:01:34
Looks great. File size limit?  
Merchants aren't going to start thinking in terms of btc until the volatility drops.  Heck, I believe most merchants aren't accepting bitcoin because it's revolutionary, but rather because it opens them up to a new, niche market.  
It would be really great if you could set the price in fiat - just speaking from a realistic, rather than ideological, point of view.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:48:52
Yeah I understand that.  Would also love a Ruby API.
@_date: 2013-07-07 00:16:25
Probably buy something you need?  I mean, there's a chance the merchant will immediately exchange it for fiat, but perhaps not.  
@_date: 2013-07-15 20:24:26
Ah, that's good to know.  I've seen them in some newer museums here.  Personally, I always assume someone's trying to push a product to me when I see them randomly on the street.

@_date: 2013-05-28 12:03:08
I've heard him before speak on this subject so maybe I can put it together.  
If data is as free as it has been, then there is too much risk for the companies that control it and no control at all for the people providing the data.  If we were paid for the content that is gobbled up and mined by companies, Lanier argues, then we'd have a more vibrant environment where there is participation up and down the power structure.
He says not to think of it as paying for everything but as getting money for much of the content that you post.  
@_date: 2013-07-15 17:41:16
Agreed.  I'd say they're better for those types of deals than for advertising/promotion.  
@_date: 2013-07-15 14:44:10
Now if anyone actually used QR codes...
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:45:02
I think it's a major stumbling point right now.  Those who do are taking a big risk and probably (hopefully) understand the market fairly well. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:36:55
or the artists
@_date: 2013-05-11 18:29:08
A usually argument against Bitcoin being a currency is that it's more like pogs or beanie babies.  A good counter is that you could never buy goods/services straight up with pogs, and you can purchase quite alot of stuff with bitcoins - even disregarding Bitspend which is a kind of middle man.
Look at how it **functions**.  
If you do you, I think, it's pretty obvious Bitcoin falls somewhere in the commodity-money range.  Whether it's a hybrid, or both at the same time, or whatever, seems to be in that general area.
Shared belief in value doesn't automatically equate to legitimacy.  Baseball cards, for instance, aren't money -&gt; even when most people agreed that many were worth a whole lot.  
I like the beer idea from ExecIN below.

I'm a rails developer.  It's easy to get into, it provides some basic security, and the community is huge and helpful.  
As for the appearance, that's Twitter Bootstrap.
It would behoove every Rails developer, however, to pull back the curtain and really learn what's going on: it would be great if developers learned Ruby first.  I'm starting to work with Node now and am sure to learn as much as I can before starting with a framework.

How about running two different Bitcoind servers?  One that only does what you need with the Blockchain, and then one that deals with payments.
