Isn't it really hard to prove that everything is fair? Even if it's open source there's now way to veirify that the code that people see is actually running on the machine, without a trusted third party.

BitcoinPool is constantly DDOS attacked as well.

Looks like you can indeed. So much of my skepticism.

But in the end, maximum amount of coins will be reached. And the only reason to mine is to get transaction fees.

One could sell something only if they would cash out BTC right away. Imagine selling an item, that costs $30, for 1 BTC and on the next day bitcoin falls to $10. It's just isn't healthy environment to sell stuff.
Of course one could cash out after every deal, but what's the point of different currency then?

Generating those ridiculously complex hashes is required to keep the transactions safe and keep sure no one transfers coins that do not exist. So you could say it's pretty useful.
One could argue if finding UFO's in humongous space is as useful as keeping a currency working.

How do you know that it worked as advertised? I mean you don't know how much he payed for the Bundle, as far as you know it could have been $0.1

BTC fluctuates against EUR also. Or against any currency for that matter. Just saying that everything else is changing, but BTC is rock solid doesn't make much sense.

I have been thinking about it as well. It's like buying stuff in gold. Why would you? You could just keep the *gold*, the value of which keeps growing, and spend the cash/other currency.
So that I wouldn't steer off topic.
I think the best option would be to keep an eye on a market value of bitcoin and keep changing the prices. Unfortunately I can't see the volatility of it changing in the near future.
Edit: Missed a word :|

But it is useful. The currency wouldn't work safely without that kind of mining.

Like lots of other people. And the slow selling will collect momentum like a rock tumbling down the mountain.

I just made an account there and was wondering why I couldn't connect. Thought the problem is on my end.
