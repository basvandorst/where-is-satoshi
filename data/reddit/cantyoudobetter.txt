Donating to a libertarian in anything other than Bitcoin seems wrong.

Just leaving this here:
[Untechnical extrapolation analysis](
@_date: 2019-07-24 19:43:57
I agree.  That is why I said correlation and not causality.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:28:16
Yea. Esp wroom 32.  I will share the code for free. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:38:33
This is a great video. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:14:38
Yea.  I am making custom fonts for the top 5. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:21:25
Esp wroom 32.  I will give away the code. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:13:03
Nothing.  My cost is $20 plus shipping and about 20 min of effort.  Plus a bit of profit. Clearly not for everyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:23:27
You can configure what you want to show on the two lines.  My line 2 says - 2 da moon.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:50:11
BTW - really cool idea.  It could just use your phone as a wifi AP.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:18:48
Cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:20:48
My fav comment.  I already wrote in the code that sizes the font down for that.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:48:50
Dude,   I am not trying to make real money here.  Just spreading some Christmas fun and wow!
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:10:41
Cool.  Thats on.  Maybe my 100 will just be 10.   :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:49:23
I am playing with some battery options that will last about a week.  But it is wifi and not cellular.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:27:43
 I have one on the bathroom mirror, one on the fridge, and one on the door to my office. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:22:03
I will probably do direct over email if I open it up. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:51:24
Holy Smokes.  This blew up.  I love all the comments and have watched some of the videos.  It is good to know that others have as equally unhealthy an obsession with crypto as I have.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:29:54
This is good because it is short.  He only got one thing wrong.  In his example, with a 10/90 reserve ratio, $9k can be loaned on the original $1k, not $900.  It is an order of magnitude worse than the video portrays.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:38:11
Did more research.  The video is right. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:15:07
And Euro support.

I am a software Dev from back in the 80s.  We used to hate MS with the firey fury of 10000 suns.  Now they have open sourced MVC and .Net.  Azure is actually an amazing offering.  And now they are snuggling with Bitcoin.  This is not the big bad MS of yore.  These guys are acting like better citizens than any of the other major news players.   
Because of that I am now buying stock, using their Dev tools and services and have started to talk nicely about them. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 00:17:46
I might have to switch.  Can't believe I just said that.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:52:42
I guess I could send the public address, but that would not prove anything.  Anyhow, I am not sure why you are busting my chops.  I am just trying to bring back some of the positive vibes and bullishness.  
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:06:19
I am finally doing this right with Armory and an offline ubuntu netbook.  Damn thing is still syncing.
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:46:49
I too am in this small but growing sliver of the BTC/M3 Venn diagram.

I need this.  How do I give money?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:30:56
I am in!!!
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:53:46
I did.  That was the part I probably failed on.  I left them in the safe at home.  I figured that if the house flooded, or if there was looting, I would just move to another address until I got back. Not sure if that is the best practice.

I am Michael Bordelon, the VP of R&amp;D at a software company in Sugar Land, TX called HCSS.  We are already underway with helping the Houston community with house cleanups.  We currently have 10 crews running and we are trying to scale up from there.  We will run out of supplies soon.  If you send me BTC to the address below, I will post the donations to the fund we are using.  Make sure to put your name and Harvey Cleanup in the note.  I am out leading crews by day, but I will post the donations to this thread each evening.   Everything helps, even if it just buys a crew lunch.   Thanks...
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:30:31
Yes.  I have been posting for this....
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:52:11
Holy crap.  That's amazing!!!  Thanks guys.  
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:16:23
Here is a link to a photo album I just started. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:55:52
I will post pics from n a bit. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:06:59
That's unfortunate.  The fort bend chamber of commerce said we were the first to respond to house cleanup in Mass.  This would be a compelling use case for Bitcoin donations.  Oh well.

Here' s our "ghostbusters" team.

I never thought to leave one word off.  Duh!!!  Thanks for the pro tip.
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:04:36
Computer, chairs, ledger, car parts.   All of which cost me about 10x now. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:55:17
I don't know why you're mean to me  
When I call on the telephone  
And I don't know what you mean to me  
But I want to turn you on  
Turn you up, figure you out  
I want to take you on  
These words, you will be mine  
These words, you will be mine, all the time  
Now fool might be my middle name  
But I'd be foolish not to say  
I'm going to make whatever it takes  
Ring you up, call you down, sign your name  
Secret love, make it rhyme  
Take you in and make you mine  
These words, you will be mine  
These words, you will be mine, all the time  
I tripped and fell, did I fall  
What I want to feel  
I want to feel it now
You know with love comes strange currencies   
And here is my appeal  
I need a chance, a second chance, a third chance  
A fourth chance, a word, a signal  
A nod, a little breath  
Just to fool myself, to catch myself  
And make it real, real  
These words, you will be mine  
These words, you will be mine, all the time  
These words, you will be mine  
These words haunt me, hunt me down, catch in my throat  
Make me pray, to say love's confines, oh
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:47:59
Yep.  Worked great. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:48:09
Not all in, but added $50k worth.  
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:25:31
Thanks dude.  I was feeling a bit worried I was they only one that got this.  
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:05:46
I love mine.  Great piece of hardware.
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:23:14
Not a rat.  I am just a gold bug/ bitcoin newbie.  I was amazed at how long it takes to get dollars converted to BTC and back.  With the current volatility, small timers like us can make some serious money is we had a lower friction way to exchange our fiat. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:42:08
I like how the old guy finishes.  - "thought this was a joke, ITS NOT."  This was the buy that was bashing it two days ago.  I think it is not a young/old problem.  It is an exposure problem.  I told my mother in law that I want to give her .05 BTC for Christmas.  She said "no thanks, it's a Ponzi scheme."  But then she let me set up a wallet and transfer the coins.  Now it's sitting there on her computer getting all "ponzied up."   I think everyone on this sub reddit should commit to setting up five family wallets this Christmas.

I dabbled in day trading during working hours.  Wasn't able to follow closely enough and missed some key buy and sell points.  From 96-98 I lost about 10k.  Wifey pit an end to that.
