Unless it becomes so pervasive that you can transact mostly or entirely in Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:30:46
The “promises” were made by people (Roger Ver and crew) who didn’t know what they were talking about. 
Those in the know, like Hal Finney, had said early on that Bitcoin needed to scale in layers and wasn’t going to remain cheap at the base layer. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:57:25
It'll cause economic damage to some participants. Some people care about that. But I think that we have to tear off the bandaid and the two ideologies need to go their separate ways.
@_date: 2017-02-01 04:05:57
Are you both the same guy talking to himself?  Seems like it.
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:23:51
I'd wager that far more pre-2013 Bitcoiners understand that Bitcoin cannot be a cheap payment network (at the base layer at least) without sacrificing decentralization, than those who do not. And that includes myself. 
When you write this:


You betray that you don't really understand the challenges that face Bitcoin, such as strong centralization pressures, and the fundamental tension that exists in cryptocurrency between capacity and decentralization. 
You also show that you don't have a competent technical understanding of SegWit, which is widely lauded by the development community as an elegant and efficient scaling solution. 
To call it "complicated" is ludicrous - we can tell that you have no idea what you're talking about. And to then suggest that the Core community created it in order to create a dependency on themselves is... batshit insane paranoid. But then that's par for the course for r/btc.
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:13:38
But sometimes.. where's the smoke, there's only bacon. 
There's no way that Wright is Satoshi. He could've proven it but he wasn't able to, resorting to subterfuge instead. Maybe he worked with some guy who was Satoshi (that Kleiman guy), but that too seems unlikely. 
At any rate, Gavin is too smart to be bamboozled like he was, so it is definitely strange.
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:49:59
Do really think this blocksize debase is about MAX_BLOCK_SIZE? Would you people please educate yourselves about the issues before storming in here?
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:19:39
But Core is a community of developers, it can't really hire a PR manager.
@_date: 2017-02-01 03:58:06
Because they could go to jail for tax evasion. Not worth the risk.
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:19:05
You do not, as evidenced by a daily stream of blocksize debate threads here. And most of the time, the arguments in favor of just changing one parameter seem to get voted to the top of the discussion, usually suspiciously... like it happens within a short period of time.
But just try to defend the Segwit approach in rbtc and you'll see what happens.
@_date: 2017-02-01 04:02:58
Bitcoin is fucked if BU "takes over" and all the main economic players know it. That is why BU is dead in the water.
@_date: 2016-03-24 17:52:37
Sigh. This has nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-13 01:40:33
What are you doing that requires rapid-fire confirmations? I use Bitcoin about once per week, and that probably makes me a heavy user comparatively speaking. I've *never* had a problem with transactions getting through. The system works brilliantly.
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:48:59
I think the toxicity here is coming from frustration over the way the core team is being disregarded over a complicated technical detail that is constantly misrepresented by prominent people such as yourself (I do believe that you are writing in good faith).
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:42:54
A hardfork can change the definition of "valid" as long as the main economic players change their node clients to match the new definition, otherwise the new fork is worthless.
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:14:33
Yeah, sad. What a waste. Oh well, this "blockchain" nonsense has to run its course. I wonder if there'll be a Merkle Tree fad. Merkle tree will revolutionize finance!!11!
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:16:57
BU believes the white paper is a blessed scripture, and like all religious extremists, they misinterpret it to suit their needs.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:07:15
It's childish and it doesn't solve anything.
@_date: 2017-02-01 18:02:07
*rolls eyes*
@_date: 2017-03-31 00:22:07
Oh my god Erik... you know fully well why SegWit hasn't breached 50%. If you think that Jihan Wu and a few other pool operators stonewalling on SegWit is representative of the what the users want.... well then I think you've lost your way.
 Also you need to understand that miner signaling is for readiness... it isn't a vote!
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:44:08


This isn't true at all.
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:19:46
But Core is just a community of developers, it can't really hire a PR manager.
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:42:51
Uhh.. the commenters there are paranoid wack jobs and are mostly talking past Rosenfeld. We must have different definitions of constructive.
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:18:50
Guys... this misconception has been shown to be completely wrong ... please for god's sake stop making fools of yourselves.
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:17:18
This assumes that the economic majority won't defend itself from a miner's attack like this. Why would you assume that?
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:30:17
If Roger and Jihan hadn't obstructed the activation of SegWit, we'd have 2.1 MB blocks right now and the price would be over $1500.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:37:43
And who would accept those blocks?
Bitfinex? No.
Poloniex? No.
Bitmex? No.
Bitstamp? No.
BTCC? No.
ShapeShift? No.
Kraken? No.
Bitsquare? No.
BTCChina? No.
Bitbank? No.
BitGo? No.
BitPay? No.
Bitonic? No.
(there are more, I forget which ones)
So what happens to a chain that isn't valued by the economic majority? It gets a low price. It languishes with all the other low-valued alt coins. The silly miners who thought otherwise realize their mistake and return to mining Bitcoin proper.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:38:26
Silly hour will be when Roger Ver and Jihan Wu attempt a hostile takeover which at this point looks destined to fail badly.
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:50:52
No, that's a false equivalence. You can't just tar both subs with the same brush. This sub is *objectively* a better and more open place for discussion, even if it is "militarized" given the constant attacks from some altcoiners and certain other bad actors. Your comment is a typical smear comment in that it attempts to muddy the waters.
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:35:04
That is stealing... not cool.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:47:03
What, no [Articles of Federation](
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:11:50
The balance of power has worked beautifully to prevent Bitcoin from being controlled by any one party. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:25:03
What does it feel like? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:41:48
I would suggest deleting it off the front page. This post has an anti-Bitcoin, pro-altcoin vibe, disguising itself as an innocent "PSA/love thy neighbour/don't invest what you can't afford to lose" post. The skewed voting seals the deal for me.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:28:33
I blame Roger for teaching gullible people that SegWit wasn't the actual compromise between small blockers and big blockers. If he hadn't done that, SegWit would be activated right now and we'd have 2.1 MB blocks and the price would be over $1500.
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:46:00
The "fidelity effect" is such bullshit. It was something conjured up in the minds of the bitcoin-must-be-visa-scale-at-layer-1 fundamentalists.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:23:40
Your straw man reduction of the fight is disingenuous, glib, and wrong. 
One side wants us all to essentially jump off a cliff take to Bitcoin forward. They assure us that at the bottom, there'll be something called "emergent consensus" to catch our fall, managed by a group of amateurs who recently invented it without any kind of serious formal review or rigorous testing. 
The other side wants us to proceed with a safe and tested small capacity increase.
Those two positions are diametrically opposed.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:27:11
Core is owned by the community so you are correct.
@_date: 2017-03-12 20:05:21


So in other words, *never*. This is the "fantasy" part of the BU initiative. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:00:09
It is becoming clear that this entire post is a concern troll.
@_date: 2017-03-12 00:56:15
That only worked because of the block subsidy, which will be a mere 3BTC in less than 8 years. A fee market is essential.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:07:00
It's opt-in RBF, though... makes a big difference.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:35:45
It depends on how motivated everyone is. An attack by a mining cartel certainly motivates me to support a POW change.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:34:14
It's easy to simplify a complicated topic for non-technical people into seductive slogans and simple arguments. A jaunt over to will reveal why they remain technically ignorant.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:15:33
You hit the nail on the head. The Core devs need a friendly-faced leader or spokesperson, like Gavin. Greg isn't able to do it all himself. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 00:20:04
Because it is a little pathetic for Erik to recuse himself from performing a proper analysis of the system. A hostile takeover of Bitcoin by a clown car of morons isn't good for his customers and he knows it. 
The cynic in me thinks he's taking a "neutral" position because his financial interests are intertwined with Ver's.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:08:19
Nice straw man - you'll have a hard time finding anybody here who is against larger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:39:34
Jihan Wu is threatening to hard fork early in one of his latest tweets. He's gone insane.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:05:42
Store of value is a gigantic use case. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:27:37
 &gt; Well there's also a group of people who believe condensation trails from airplanes are actually the government misting the world with chemicals.
So true, and if anyone is in doubt all they'll have to do is scan the post titles in to get a whiff of the crazy.
@_date: 2017-03-29 01:11:58
Muh "original vision" lol
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:42:19
Sirer is an odd character. He's always seemed to be anti-bitcoin to me, but sometimes he appears with useful analysis and potential solutions. 
Despite his confidence, he gets lots of things wrong like his incorrect prediction of how the Ethereum fork would play out.
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:20:16
That's awesome! Wow, advertising Bitcoin to actually promote Bitcoin itself - why has it taken so long?!
@_date: 2017-03-31 00:16:36
According to those companies don't matter. Only the miners and a few shitty companies do - they'll define the new Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:22:52
Please, redditor for 9 days, tell us why he's wrong. What does your script say?
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:43:56
LOL I think you're right.
@_date: 2017-01-14 02:52:35
Sorry, but Bitcoin doesn't excel as a communications protocol. Counterparty is a misuse of the Bitocoin blockchain, which is primarily intended to be a decentralized form of money. 
Unfortunately for you, Counterparty and its ilk are projects founded on the flawed idea that Bitcoin can serve non-monetary use cases cheaply and while maintaining its decentralization. Time and experience has proven this assumption to be false. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:30:08
It's because SegWit paves the way for 2MB blocks. We need it first.
@_date: 2018-06-27 02:26:13
Allaire made A brutal mistake by abandoning Bitcoin sales a year before the massive 2017 bubble.
  Coinbase was onboarding 100k customers per day at one point! Meanwhile Circle was trying to catch up to Square, who’ve embraced Bitcoin the way Circle used to. 
Chalk it up as one of the biggest screwups in Bitcoin business history.
@_date: 2018-06-17 22:27:14
Nobody knows if he holds 1M coins. That’s speculation base on the analysis of extraNonce values in early blocks, but it’s not proof.
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:59:46


One of the most annoying things about this sub is how freakin' quick some people are to see conspiracies in everything. In this case, Garzik took a casual suggestion and implemented it. Get a grip, folks.
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:59:37
 &gt; Because the repo is controlled by those who'd rather extract fees via Blockstream by keeping the blocksize small.
Care to back up that assertion? I see people making it but it doesn't make any sense and seems more like lazy slander.
@_date: 2016-10-06 05:48:32
They're not talking about blockchain in the cryptocurrency sense, but in the shared database sense, so it's kinda pointless.
@_date: 2016-10-04 06:52:58
You are in but it gets occasionally brigaded by Roger's Pets over in @_date: 2016-10-17 20:07:49
Weird how this comment suddenly went from the top to the bottom. Roger's voting crew at it again?
@_date: 2016-10-11 16:55:59
No because that would be stupid. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 16:54:50
Haha! That's the result of too much groupthink.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:35:13
Hear, hear. There's a ton of disinformation being spread by Ver's shills saying that hashpower determines the rules and that this position is backed by Satoshi's Whitepaper, an assertion that has been thoroughly discredited long ago. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 08:40:06
That hype was why so many people bought into the presale. You cannot just hand wave that away because it's no longer convenient. Ethereum was supposed to be about the cold and disinterested execution of contracts by machine, not by people. We already have people interpreting contracts in our existing real world system.
Ethereum has abandoned its principles and in the process is tarnishing its reputation, screwing over those who did not invest in the DAO, and is making a mockery of "systems that can't care" and unstoppable code and all those claims.
Bugs that aren't intended in the contract... well boohoo. That's the nature of risk. The writers of the DAO contract made some very bold claims about how the final word on the contract is the code itself. And when that blew up, they begged for a do-over... and surprisingly they got it. How quickly principles are abandoned when money is at stake.
