You got a rejection letter from an aide that vaguely states some people in their employ have some bitcoins and suddenly Penn Jillette is a btc millionare.

I'm sure as soon as they can shift their enormous girths off the futons in their parent's basements the elite hackers of bitcoin will exact a swift and terrible vengeance. For the crime of suggesting that Nakamoto may be closer to Hank Hill than John Galt.

I'm convinced that serious bitcoiners are the financial equivalent of bronies.

Guys, I have trained my ferret to memorize a 256 character numeric string. On command he'll take a pen and scribble it down on a piece of paper. Is this a safe way to store bitcoins?

Don't get groceries at Walmart. Shit is nasty. Produce sits in their warehouses and overripens, a lot of their meat is "solution-enhanced" (pumped full of water/preservatives to up the weight), most of the dry staples are overpriced for their area, and the rest of the stuff is processed garbage.

Couldn't you have done the same thing with Paypal? 
I get the part with lower fees than a bank/wire transfer but that's not relevant to your anecdote. Unless your girlfriend was buying more than $1000 or so worth of groceries you could have done the same with Paypal and at a faster speed with no waiting for a blockchain confirmation.

Would your average bitcoiner be expected to pay extra rent for each of his (probably several) realdolls?

What if it's not a scam? As Bruce Wagner proclaimed to the masses "Buy high! Sell low! You'll still make profit!".
Who are you to decry child-prostitution-loving Bitcoin Jesus?

Satoshi has always been Ron Paul and Bitcoin is his only begotten son, born of the free market, come to earth to absolve us of our sins of dirty fiat currency.
Ron Paul rex coelestis. Bitcoin fili unigenite, amen.

Eagerly awaiting the first bitcoin champagne room. Awkward silence as the stripper stares impatiently at her phone waiting for the transfer to verify. Client sweating slightly under her withering gaze as he nervously stammers out a rehearsed speech of how he has freed her and her trade from the oppressive nature of government fiat. 10 minutes later the lap dance can finally begin. 
He creams his Batman underwear 20 seconds in, a stain slowly forming on the front of his best grey sweatpants. He wipes his face on his Rainbow Dash tshirt and apologizes while the stripper wipes off the faux leather couch. She acts as though she's not embarrased for him but the truth is painfully obvious. His night complete our bitcoiner leaves the club to return to the relative comfort of his mother's basement. As he gets on the bus he pauses to take a last look at the softly humming neon sign above the strip club. "Titcoin", it proudly reads.

If Sealand starts mining they'll finally produce something!
Mostly waste heat but at least they'd be trying.

Isn't it a commodity this week? I always lose track of how bitcoin is being advertised.
@_date: 2013-08-07 12:04:11
I don't think anyone is arguing that bitcoin can't be used as a currency at this point. Your smug is a little bit misdirected. There's a pretty long divide between a judge saying "eh, you can buy some shit with this?" and NEW WORLD CURRENCY ZOMG

So what exactly did bitcoin do here? Do you only donate from bitcoin generated business profits?

Buttplug + Bitcoin = Buttcoin.
 You missed such an opportunity.

I suppose it could work if their landlord, suppliers, utilities provider and insurance company all accept bitcoins as well. There's also the matter of local, state, and federal taxes but that seems to be a touchy subject with bitcoins.
Such a business could cash out bitcoins as they receive them but then there's the matter of surcharges from the exchanges. Or trying to sell in a down market when they need that cash now.

Atlas is busy with his nth attempt to get on the polyphasic sleep schedule. Bruce Wagner is in jail in either Thailand or the US (maybe both). Matthew N. Wright spends 24/7 trying to justify twisting out of his bet with the community to the entire world. Pirateat40 is either living on a private island or secretly being held in federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison by the FBI.

C'mon guys it's so easy! Just get a wallet app for your phone, purchase some bitcoins, scan the captcha, wait 10 minutes for the transaction to...hey wait where are you going?!

Oh wow, Roger takes his store down after bitcoin hits a 30 day low? I AM SHOCKED.
@_date: 2013-08-07 12:23:27
You'd make a lot more money if you bought/sold Magic cards instead of bitcoin. I am dead serious about this. Same business model but the cards have a greater trade volume.

How is it perfect with the lag in confirmations? Is there anyone that wants to wait several minutes for their payment to be confirmed?

Will these policies cover fires started by poorly built and/or overcrowded mining rigs? What about brain damage caused by heat stroke due to sleeping in the same room as mining rigs?

Why is the bounty in worthless fiat? I demand Roger offer a bounty of 31.847133758 btc.
