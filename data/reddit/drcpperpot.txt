Huge news. Hats off to Lopp and the LN team!

The point is that you could then use that money from Jan 1 2019 until April 2020 before needing to pay taxes on it. Do you not understand time = money? You seem to be the stupid one here.

What he said was, "I am the state!".  
Real humble guy there.

No, keep the prices high- it's an alarm bell for all the head-in-sand ostrich plebs to re-examine why the world isn't working out as they thought it would. I don't want them to feel comfortable, I want them to have a fire lit inside them to figure out what is really going on. High prices display the paradigm shift at hand better than anything else I can think of.

~Hello all.  
If you are in the USA, I would like to point out that now is a good time tax-wise to buy and hold BTC. By buying before Jan 1 2018, you can hold until Jan 1 2019 and avoid paying short-term capital gains taxes while also avoiding needing to settle up on those taxes until April 2020, when 2019 taxes are due. There is a lot of time for you do constructive things with that captured value potentially in that time.  
  
Also, we should see Lightning Network (LN) on BTC mainnet by then, which should be very bullish for prices as the coin will have a greatly increased utility. I'd also imagine we will either have or be on the precipice of atomic swaps by that time. Big things to be excited about, for sure...
  
Just food for thought though- good luck with your holdings, health and wealth in the new year :-)

Who exactly do you think the US does business with? Not Europe? Not China?  
  
What do you think the ongoing US deficit spending is funded by? Un-inflation?  
  
What do you think FASB 157 implies? Orderly, sufficiently liquid markets in existence?  
  
I don't really understand how you can presume to think that US economy exists on an island, and also don't understand why you seem to think BTC should only represent what is going on with the local US economy (if there even is such a thing).

Completely agree with this, as painful as it is to admit about the trajectory of the states these past 104 years...

Nah its ok, the free press legitimizing btc in the eyes of the public will be much more valuable than any short-term bubble crash crap. Besides, BTC isn't like some pump and dump penny stock- this is the real deal!

As long as they don't move though- you *know* it's secure...

Szabo/Finney, and maybe one or two others. Satoshi was always meant to be a pseudonymous figure, used to safely introduce btc to the world with. The genius of his legendary wallet is that it's untouched-ness is implicit proof that the system is secure.

He got his huge BCash bet checked by Wall St., who have run the price up to levels unassailable by Ver's consortium. I could see why he is frustrated. If they really were counting on a flippening though, it would have been a dumb, all-in move, setting themselves up for a knockout-punch.

AntPool doing pretty much everything they can to try and destroy bitcoin. Smh. “Evil”

Hi all. Stopping by from your local bitcoin trading sub to deliver a [friendly message]( Enjoy!

The deflationary part of bitcoin is what gives it its strength vs other currencies. If removed, it would lose it's value rather quickly...
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:32:04
Because the people using Bitcoin want it to be decentralized, and that includes being decentralized from control by the miners. The miners are wrong to *insist* that this hardfork happen. That is not compromise- that is contentious coercion.

I agree- naked futures selling (aka 'puking') is one of the major reasons gold price has been suppressed these past several years. I think you are right to be skeptical of this move. Being able to short/long BTC and settle in pure cash without taking delivery of the coin is immensely dangerous for something with such a small market cap. Guess we'll find out how dangerous in the next year of BTC. Stay tuned folks...

QTUM  
NEO  
Waltonchain  
Verge (XVG)  
ZEC  
Vertcoin (VTC)  
DASH  
Litecoin (LTC)  
Waves  
Decred  
I am sure there are plenty of others worthy of investment, but these are the ones I am aware of offering a good present/future value proposition. Alts are generally going down right now, so probably hold off buying until they are confirmed to have bottomed out.

Yes- presumably, this means that they can short the coin using USD, and then settle with the parties in USD or whatever fiat instead of exchanging any actual coin. I wish I were more fluent in this issue, but I'm merely aware that is occurring in other markets... Look up GLD/Gold futures manipulation. Also, you might want to check out the gold price charts from 2008 (USD crash) to 2011 (weird drop in price aka manipulation) to now (controlled). There are ongoing lawsuits regarding this issue and the supposed market manipulation in US courts now, and prominent intellectuals pursuing these cases...

Can't you install Electrum Wallet onto a USB thumb-drive and make backup copies as needed? Curious about this myself...
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:46:28
Many thanks for the reply. What about a encrypted virtual machine image (like ubuntu), on which you run electrum, on a thumb drive? Would that be better/acceptable?
@_date: 2017-07-07 07:09:12
No! Farming Bitcoin is a massive advantage to society!  
Having a decentralized ledger is a bulwark against currency manipulation by inflation. Bitcoin (or any decentralized blockchain coin/asset with fixed issuance) has immense social value on these grounds alone.  
Bitcoin (and the blockchain as an archetype) is doing to money what the internet already did to communication!

Fantastic post :-) Thank you
