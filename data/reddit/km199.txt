Not true. I have an account and I’m 16. Maybe they changed it. It’s easier to have ur parents make an account and then use that tho.

Many governments use currencies that they don’t control. Like all the countries that use the Euro and the countries that use the US dollar. How is it dumb for a government to use a currency they don’t control and why should a government control the currency?

Fuck Bitmex tho

No one regulates Bitcoin, yet it still works ....

They trade against their users with their trading arm. And if uve ever used them during a period of volatility, they don’t let your trades through.

So the only backing is that the government will take it away by force? I wouldn’t call that backing, some states allow tax payments in Crypto. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:01:36
Backed how and by what exactly? You can’t go the government and redeem anything with your USD. It’s issued by the government but they do nothing to prop up the value, therefore it’s not backed.
@_date: 2018-12-15 01:47:34
If their were less taxes or even no taxes, the US dollar would still retain its value. Its value comes from its widespread use, plus people think it's valuable too.

Thx !ntip 15

Same thing

You could try local bitcoins or see if your friends have Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:44:44
Is it on iOS or a website?
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:07:14
What are the 3 points? And why should miners mine at a loss? If they don’t think it’s worth it that’s up to them.

Bitnodes is currently being developed to estimate the size of the Bitcoin network by finding all the reachable nodes in the network. The current methodology involves sending getaddr messages recursively to find all the reachable nodes in the network, starting from a set of seed nodes. Bitnodes uses Bitcoin protocol version 70001 (i.e. &gt;= /Satoshi:0.8.x/), so nodes running an older protocol version will be skipped. The crawler implementation in Python is available from GitHub (ayeowch/bitnodes) and the crawler deployment is documented in Provisioning Bitcoin Network Crawler.

Check bitcoin.earn, are you saying 9500 is to many or to little?

Ima set up a node when I get home, will a raspberry pi work?

Bitcoin fees are very low. For international transactions, bank transfers, and normal transactions, Bitcoin is much cheaper and faster. Plus with the Lightening Network gaining adoption, fees will drop to next to nothing, and  using Bitcoin will be less expensive that a credit card or PayPal. Plenty of things are sold only in Bitcoin and not immediately cashed out. 
How would Bitcoin be more of a currency if it didn’t grow?
@_date: 2018-12-30 06:51:15
It’s an underestimate then.
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:23:37
It’s the number of nodes that they are able to recursively connect to, probably a little lower than the total. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:09:05
The price doesn’t affect why I believe in Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:43:15
The argument for Bitcoin being a currency is that people use it to transact. The whole world doesn’t have to use Bitcoin for it to be a currency.
@_date: 2018-12-31 05:31:34
That’d significantly hurt any businesses that relies on the internet, and therefor their economy

No I’m using the default reddit app

Bitcoin may not be stable for a long time, but as adoption increases the price will rise. If it were to become used as much as USD it would stabilize because so many people use it, just like how the dollar is stable. People would have to be paid in Bitcoin, and spend in Bitcoin. The dollar isn’t backed by anything, yet it’s value stays pretty much the same, decreasing by a few percent per year because of inflation. Since Bitcoin is capped at 21 million, it wouldn’t decrease in value from inflation. 
Some people do store money in Bitcoin, and have been for years. However people who do that are missing the point. Money isn’t meant to be stored or hoarded, but invested and spent. I’m not sure how store of value became one of Bitcoins selling points, it’s not a great argument in a volatile market.
