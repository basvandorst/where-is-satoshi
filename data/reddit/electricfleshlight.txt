Divorce her immediately if it bothers you so much.  You don't pay alimony for someone who's only been unemployed for three weeks.  And then you don't have to worry about her taking half "your" shit because you *both* paid for it, considering she was working.  It's a much more equitable split than you willingly accepting a housewife and choosing to pay for everything of your own volition.  Dumbass. 


Why the fuck would you quit your job?  Jesus you're a melodramatic little snowflake aren't you?

No it's not.  It's closer to 30% for first marriages and it gets lower when the partners are educated and don't get married too young or have kids too young.

I like how you ran off like a scared little girl because you had no valid response to my comment.

You can initiate divorce proceedings immediately in all 50 states. There may be a waiting period but you're under no obligation to continue giving your wife money, nor will 6-12 months of unemployment get you slapped with alimony. 


*Losing* her job? You said she quit her job. Don't you go changing the goalposts you disingenuous little shit.  If she loses her job then you're welcome to wait and help her find a new one, because again 6-12 months of unemployment isn't going to get you slapped with an alimony bill nor does it suddenly make all the household assets "yours" that she'll "steal" half of. 


You both paid for it, why is it just "yours"? You can buy her out of her half of the equity, or she can buy you out of yours, or you can sell it and split the equity. Or what, you think you should just get the whole thing because you're a man and a working woman *never* contributes to the mortgage?


What the fuck kind of idiot are you? You don't have to quit your job, and you don't have to pay for anything either *because you won't be paying alimony if you were smart enough to marry a working woman.*
God you're a histrionic baby.
