Can you select other news you want to receive? For example I want to follow charlie lee tweets, can I add it? Thats basicly the bloomberg of crypto, great job!

What if you invested 5% and today its worth more than 50%? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:48:21
Its on their website. I got mine 2 days after the estimated time. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:43:14
Well time to check r/coinbase . I´ve been using them for 4 years, and this month I´m having problems for the first time. I guess ill stick to p2p after all...
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:10:36
Not sure, but if you send to a public adress you previously used you should still get the coins. Can someone confirm?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:47:51
960sat/byte, first confirmation after 2 hours...
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:46:03
Paid 150USD and 1 hour after no confirmations lmao

You can take your seed, buy a one way ticket and start a new life anywhere in the world. That´s why I own Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-03 19:23:59
My life just much easier as soon as I got a ledger... That feel of opening my electrum wallet and waiting to see if the balance doesnt "disapear" is worth the 100 bucks
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:40:17
I also sold what is for me a life change amount. I still hodl Bitcoin, but last year the price jump was crazy. Oh well, by the moment I post this we will probably be back at ATH.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:16:56

I used to trade on polo. Now using bittrex since polo is awfull. Not going back anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-10-17 19:16:52
The 210b you are talking about is the last price known. If someone were to sold 1bil in bitcoin the market would suffer a lot. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:32:11
forex USD &gt; EUR have been rapping us hard. If it was 5 months ago we would be flying. HODL!

@_date: 2019-08-02 11:28:44
Maybe next time you shouldnt be buying gold from the bank, but perhaps apmex, provident, etc etc. Look im all in for bitcoin but also got a nice amount of gold just in case. Also in € (my currency) the price already jumped almost 30% up in the last 12 months, peanut growth for bitcoin but gold is a tool against inflation and its working just fine.

@_date: 2019-02-01 23:28:57
Well checked the new fiat exchange and GDAX is much better off. Also never had any problem with them, all withdraws processed in under 48hours... I´d like to support binance more but for that they need to be more attractive than gdax. 
@_date: 2019-06-09 17:19:57
The next wave will be HUGE!
@_date: 2019-02-10 13:35:45
Can you withdraw with skrill? Last time i checked it was just "paper btc"
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:50:03

True, I got a second email and this time my limits were increased. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:33:09
I care more about 9k than 10k. The day we hit 9k we will brake the internet.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:47:18
20 years?
More like 2 years at the current grow rate.
However it can also go to zero! Only time will tell. HODL! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:33:58
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:06:46
Download electrum and put your bitcoins on it. Save the seed and you are good to go. I cant fcking believe people still keep bitcoin on online wallets.

@_date: 2017-11-06 19:18:24
Will buy at 6k$
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:30:57
Why not sell peer to peer? There´s tons of people wanting to buy and they don´t know how. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:43:31
More people will jump in at 10k
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:05:22
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:49:20
Half full :D
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:47:36
I think we are still far from what is the real value of bitcoin. People are just starting to realize the benefits of this amazing technology! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:11:31
The day we get to 9k, we will break the internet. I´ve got a champagne bottle to celebrate when it happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:11:22
Well I bought 12 hours ago at 7.3k, here we are...
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:08:29
TBH I didnt tought it was that good. Im loving my ledger, might buy another one for day to day transfers! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:52:09
Same, its phishing
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:03:11
Having the ability to wake up, take the next plane and start over anywhere in the world without having to deal with the banks, questions... That´s why Im in cryptos, the price going up is a plus ofc, but I´ll never sacrifice this freedom over more networth. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 09:26:40
and yet they are more "pure" than the other diamonds.
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:42:53
You can buy BTC with your skrill balance. However the last time I checked they didnt allow BTC withdrawl lol You can use localbitcoins but for skrill payment you will have a somewhat big markup
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:23:38
When you think about it, lots of DN sellers are now millionaires ahah
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:05:46

My only fear was when the rocket took off I wouldnt have enuff stake in the game. Either up or down, my ticket is bought. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:25:02
Have enuff skin in the game to be life changing, still crossing my fingers to go low enuff so I can load more. Think long therm, would you rather loose a life changing opportunity or 1 year of salary? Easy choice for me. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:50:59

@_date: 2017-09-07 08:59:35
Em Lisboa há várias pessoas a comprar BTC por €. Tudo offline, pago em dinheiro. Conheço um Chinês que compra até 100k€ de uma só vez...
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:23:23
Também, mas para comprar a uma pessoa vais pagar um premium enorme. Podes comprar na coinbase que não há risco nenhum das finanças chatearem uma vez que só pagas 28% nos benefícios quando vendes, e se vendes a uma pessoa, eles nunca irão saber que vendeste. Se bem que em Portugal duvido muito que consigam regular alguma coisa tbh...
@_date: 2017-09-07 08:54:18
É bom ver um Português por aqui!
I never sell via coinbase. You can easily convert BTC to CASH without using any of this services. 
I considered to buy in Porto, but at my age it´s still a bit to early to invest such a huge amount.
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:55:29
I can live 2 years all expenses accounted with 4k$

Nothing but good things to say about bittrex. we all instantly had our btcash so we could dump it. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:51:36
Couldnt find the info in EN. Update with your link. You the best! 
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:16:37
Yes I agree with your reasons. However we are still early adopters. In my country only people that bought stuff on the DNET know what bitcoin is. HODL! 
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:01:02
Patiently waiting for coinbase to credit my bank transfer to finaly be one the club. Congratz. HODL!!!!
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:01:33
Exactly! To each his own and we all have diferent beliefs, however to have an exit plan is always good. Expect the unexpected. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 08:06:20
I am afraid they start to track everything. Other than gold/silver/btc what do you suggest?
@_date: 2017-09-19 08:46:26
A year
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:22:52
Tbh for this amount of cash id go personaly after the DEA agents involved...
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:58:14
Download a wallet and withdraw your coins. I use electrum-ltc and no problem so far. Also for 75 coins id purchase a ledger (hardware wallet) 
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:33:17
I´ll gladly pay the fees to support the miners. I dont like to support greedy bank pigs. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:13:25
I´ll be honest, i´ve been using coinbase for a while and its been working very well. Deposits and withdraws under 24 hours, never got any problem buying or selling. I never tryed their support because I never needed, however I heard it sucks, just check coinbase subreddit.  
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:13:45
I see 6300
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:27:35
I know, however id go PERSONALY after them. 20k is a lot of cash. I have time, you dont fck with someone Who have time in his hands
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:16:44
Sempre cara à cara. 
Sinceramente não desde que tomes as devidas precauções. Se fosse trocar uma quantia elevada não me importaria de pagar um gratificado de 100€ a um polícia para me escoltar 2 horas. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:37:01
Its just a start...
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:17:52
I still live pretty frugaly, I live the same life as before, but everyone around me feel something is different with me. They just cant figure out what, some people tell me I am misterious, others pretend to know whats going on but they dont know half the story. I am 25 and just building my life waiting to pull the early retirement trigger. Im to scared if I retire now I will loose the oportunity to learn some new skills at my job. I´ll give it a few years and go my own way. Overall Im just chilling life, dont feel the need to impress people anymore.
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:52:18
The seed is everything you need. Even if you lost your computer, you can recover all your coins with your seed. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:44:40
Its more about how the world is changing... Thats why Bitcoin is more valued every day.
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:15:21
Just came back from the bank, and god damn I want the financial system to burn. This poor old men was pressured to pay the credit in more "confortable" payments. I also had to pay 5$ to withdraw cash from my bank (everyone have to pay for withdraws over 400$ since it´s the daily limit at the atm) 
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:24:20
Pena não venderes nada que eu necessite. No entanto big up por aceitares bitcoin. Força! 
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:46:12
What is not allowing you to?
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:46:04
We don´t need to educate the medias, 5.3k and counting. Bitcoin is a position of power, we are alone on the journey, lets rise and shine! 
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:33:14
Estou dentro desde 2014 e já vi e ouvi muito. O bitcoin vai viver. O preço vai cair, vai voltar a subir. Estamos prestes a ver uma crise de liberdade económica jamais vista. Onde achas que as pessoas vão guardar o dinheiro? Ouro, prata, terrenos, arte e agora BTC. 
Mas é como tudo, não invistas aquilo que não estás disposto a perder...

Honestly fck this system. I may still work part-time but only because I want, not because I need.

@_date: 2019-05-13 19:19:13
Use gdax instead.
