Same - I downloaded it but its not appearing and I can't re-download it as it says its already installed.

I downloaded it via the direct link in the other post, and it isn't appearing on my extensions page. When I search for it on the Chrome Store its not appearing either.
But when I go to download it via the direct link again it says it's already installed?

2 hour interview and we barely have more than a blurb.

Exact same error I'm getting. Clearly this isn't resolved.

I wonder what Cointree will do, will they have to follow suit?

No they moved their head office to London so they no longer have to charge GST as they technically are not operating out of Australia.

Yeah I emailed them feedback complaining of the very same thing. Also, they sent the card and the PIN in the same fucking letter... which is pretty dumb.

Bloody hell that's cheap. Site looks a bit dodgy though.

Bitinnovate.com. Their commission is 7.9% which isnt bad and you have the coins within the hour.

It may seem so, but it's one of the only sites that allow Aussie local bank transfers without international fees, and also their buy price is usually at least $2-3AUD less than any other bitcoin buy site. But, if you know better sites to buy from I'd love to know, and possibly save some money!
