I think the blockchain should be increased at this time, but Bitcoin can never grow to such a size that all transactions go on the blockchain. This issue has always been present, but was pushed back by the Bitcoin promoters, since the issue would be moot if Bitcoin never saw widespread adoption. The question then becomes, how do you entice higher transaction layers to development?

Heh, banks don't work that way. I've seen them return a bank wire, which is against the law, but you'd have to sue them to win the case. I've seen them freeze accounts for over a year, without any communication with the customer. I've seen them return funds from stolen checks, weeks after certifying the money as good.
Banks will do anything and everything to ensure that they don't take losses. You may have to sue if you believe they've acted illegally.

People won't stop using credit cards. They're more convenient. However, people may see an advantage to Bitcoin in these areas:

2) Sending money to other countries. In Texas, there are hundreds of people in each store, lined up every night to send money back to Mexico through venues such as Western Union. If they could use Bitcoin for that, then they would lower their fees.

The issue with inflation is not necessarily that the dollar loses value; rather it's that the process of inflation allows real wealth to be taken out of the economy. Every time someone is paid with a newly printed, 'borrowed', dollar, the money they receive is used to bid up the prices of all the goods and services on the market that we all use. So, they compete for the goods and services that I use, and they are not working in a productive job which adds to these goods and services. This is the hidden theft behind inflation.

Moreover, about once a year or so, there is a story in the newspaper describing how some crime was thwarted by an honest citizen with a gun. So it seems to work well.

I don't think Bitcoin will replace credit cards for local use, but there are some things that Bitcoin seems suited for:
1) Buying stuff when traveling. Due to exchange rate losses, people might be inclined to use Bitcoin when traveling to other countries, rather than pay high exchange fees.
2) Sending money to relatives. In Texas, there are long lines in the evening where people line up to send money to their relatives in Mexico. If it becomes easy to buy and sell bitcoins, then this could change.
3) Large and low-markup purchases. Credit cards are not suitable for purchasing items with a low markup due to the charge-back risk. Bitcoin could find a niche area here.
4) International Business Payments. Business to business payments could use Bitcoin to facilitate the transfer of large sums of money, bypassing the extended delays and large fees of the banks.
So I think that consumer merchandise, while exciting, may never really see a large chunk of the Bitcoin market.

No doubt, a lot of real wealth has been created; but a lot of that real wealth has been taken through inflation, and given to those who are not productive.

A deflationary supply of money, created by a stable money supply and a growing economy, is an untested environment. With gold, there was still mining which increased its total supply about 2% per year, which worked well for the economy.

It will be interesting.

Some important Bitcoin points:
* Merchants in the third world are not able to compete because of high exchange rates, as no one wants their country's currency. Bitcoin offers a solution to this.
* Currently, it takes hours and high fees to send money overseas, or even to wire money within the country. With Bitcoin, money can be sent anywhere, within minutes, from any location.
* With multi-signature addresses, Bitcoin can be as secure as any corporate bank account.
* Bitcoin is to fiat currency what email is to mail.

Bitcoin is treated just like gold or silver. If you receive Bitcoins for a sale, then you need to record the US dollar value of the bitcoins when you receive them, just as if you received dollars, and then bought bitcoins with those dollars. If you spend bitcoins for something, then you need to consider that as a sale of bitcoins for dollars, afterwhich you used those dollars to purchase that something. Whenever you sell bitcoins, (or trade them for something), a capital gains tax may need to be reported if the value of your bitcoins that you traded in, were more than they were when you purchased them.

Wouldn't this explain why the Bitcoin price at MtGox has been persistently higher over these past six months or so? Presumably, when Mtgox had USD liquidity issues, people with USD in their accounts starting buying bitcoins to cash out; but this type of behavior couldn't go on for more than a month or so; yet it continued from June 2013 - Feb 2014. 
If, on the other hand, someone had found an exploit whereby he could withdraw bitcoins from duplicate transactions, then he would have a strong incentive to send more dollars to MtGox to continue this type of scam, for as long as he could. Hence, it may have taken six months for MtGox to go broke, and all the while, their bitcoin price would have been higher because of the continued use of this scam.

The problem is that you can't define order and chaos, when it comes to applying the idea to law. So it doesn't lead to the creation of an ordered society in everyone's mind.
People need to respect each other, as equals, and to do this, we need to stop threatening people with violence when they don't act as we demand. Violence and threats of violence against people acting in their own domain, should be the only crime. The idea behind the voluntary society is that people should be able to choose their own form of governance; everyone, individually. The regulations which arise from this type of society will vary from place to place, but the only universal crimes will be those which threaten others with violence, theft, and fraud.

Soft payments like Credit Cards are consumer friendly. If you don't like the way a seller treats you, just reverse the payment. So Bitcoin may not find a significant market where people can use credit cards. Bitcoin's strength is where hard currencies are preferred, like: sending money overseas; business to business payments; payments which would otherwise require high fees or an unprofitable exchange rate. Bitcoin's strength as a currency exists because it is irreversible. Bitcoin's weakness for consumers is that it is not always as consumer friendly as a credit card.

e-gold had a written opinion from the Treasury Department that they were not regulated as such, and were not required to register with Fincen. Doug Jackson spent 18 months, and $800,000, and won that case. Then six months later, they were approached and told that they would be charged with aiding child pornography if they didn't take a plea for the same crimes for which they had been acquitted. Afterwards, they were not able to get the money transmitter license.
e-gold offered a lot of advantages over Bitcoin:
1) The entire e-gold database was available, and frequently used, by law enforcement when crimes were committed, and law enforcement got the court subpoena necessary. Effectively, for law enforcement, putting all transactions in a central location made their job a lot easier.
2) Gold is much more stable than bitcoin. 
3) e-gold had personnel who would help with any transaction which did had problems due to any technical nature. Bitcoin has no such protection, and there was a case in Oct, 2011, where bitcoins were sent to an invalid address, and effectively lost in the Bitcoin network.
The idea that e-gold was used by shady characters was simply a myth in the sense that there are just as many shady characters using Bitcoin as there ever were using e-gold.

Bitcoin didn't break during the stress tests, but it's quite likely a few people were put off by it, to a large degree. Some transactions with the proper fees were taking over 24 hours to settle. This is unacceptable when a payment processor promises quick settlement. The stress test emphasized the need for a quick solution, not the other way around.

This will never happen. You're extrapolating as if users and merchants will actively make some sort of choice. What will happen is that the same products will continue to work as they do now, once 75% of the mining power chooses XT. The 25% mining on the old chain will become insignificant.
@_date: 2015-08-14 12:15:16
So you're admitting to having committed crimes?

Unfortunately, you can't separate the two. If XT becomes the norm, then Hearn is the new lead developer.

Purse.io has a systemic problem. It is matching up credit card purchases for people who want to buy with Bitcoin. Credit cards can be reversed. Bitcoin cannot. I don't know how they resolve this but this type of business has no room for any type of credit card reversal. Moreover, credit card thieves want something which is as good as cash, like Bitcoin. They don't want merchandise delivered to their door. Tie all this together and Purse.io, or Amazon.com, just may be delaying the order to ensure that the credit card is good.

How would it be a prank if all the pages work?
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:56:12
Absolutely true!
I used to sell e-gold back in 2000. We all quickly learned that it's not possible to move a soft money into a hard money without very strong identification; much stronger than Amazon requires. Moreover, when thieves find a path from their list of stolen credit card numbers, to a hard currency, they'll try to turn over as much money as possible. So a single fraudulent user could generate a lot of transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:02:07
1)If fraud was really an issue or a problem, why after all these months are there NO cases documented in the press?
Because Purse.io was too small to be on a lot of people's radar until recently.
2)Why would a huge and technologically savy company like Amazon let rampant fraud go unprosecuted?
Because there's no one to prosecute. Criminals buy stolen credit card numbers in large data sets. They generate whatever forms and information are needed to open an Amazon account. Then they use purse.io to buy bitcoins with their stolen credit cards and have the items delivered to the Bitcoin seller. Amazon is just stuck with the losses.

The OP means that the network can handle the traffic. The problem is that the block size can't.

Bitcoin is designed to allow the creation of six blocks an hour. Each block can hold 1 megabyte of transactions. Increasing the number of transactions does not increase the speed at which blocks can be created, nor the number of transactions which can be processed.

127 per page.
There are more bitcoin addresses than there are grains of sand on all the beaches, on all the planets, on all the galaxies in the Universe. If someone discovers your bitcoin private key, when it was truly randomly generated, then he is, literally, the luckiest person who has ever, or will ever, exist.
@_date: 2015-07-09 00:10:57
You're assuming linear growth. It is quite possible that growth will accelerate as Bitcoin gains popularity. There will also be periods of higher volume, and periods of lesser volume during any sample period. If Bitcoin were a centrally managed transaction system, management would be worried at the small amount of extra capacity.
@_date: 2015-07-07 12:43:23
Your assessment is spot-on.
But really, it's the nature of public debate. Minority opinions are frequently held silent by a larger group of popular opinions, until they are proven right. Now they are speaking up.
@_date: 2015-07-30 15:49:19
Yes, it's a crime, but there's no way to know who actually committed the crime. When an anonymous user buys credit card data from the dark web and starts using them to buy Bitcoin through Purse.io, there's no way for anyone to know who he is. He is pretending to be the person who's credit card information he is using, while the products he purchased are delivered to the buyer who paid him with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:35:22
People think that Bitcoin can handle up to 7 transactions per second, but if you average the number of transactions being put into each block, over the past 10 blocks, the average comes out to 1017 transactions per block, which averages to 1.69 transactions per second.
Bitcoin is at capacity, with or without the current stress.

Zero Confirmation Confidence is an illusion. Double-spends can occur against them with higher fees, and a higher priority, being given to a second transaction. It would be nice if we could trust a zero-confirmation transaction, but we can't.

You convert each payment into its equivalent value in dollars, for taxes. So if someone gives you $10 in Bitcoin, you record that as $10 in income, and then a $10 purchase of Bitcoin. At the end of the year, you will have $10 to report in income, and you will then own $10 in Bitcoin, which is the same as if you had bought stock, or gold, or anything else.
Alternatively, use a Coinbase account, and they will simply give you the $10 and you will never have to worry about Bitcoin.

One of the problems with Electrum is that it connects and sends its transactions to only the one server to which it's connected. If the transaction does not show up on Blockchain.info/address, then connect to another server in electrum, and you'll notice that the transaction does not exist. Send the transaction again attached to this second server, and it will work.
@_date: 2015-03-14 20:19:24
Electrum connects to an electrum server, which connects to the Bitcoin network. You can run your own electrum server and connect to it, if you want. You can also tell your electrum server to connect to your bitcoin server. But Electrum does not send over private keys to the servers, so there's no risk to use a public electrum server.

If he used fraud to receive the money, then this has nothing to do with calling himself Satoshi. That's not his legal name. If someone dispensing the grants, made a decision on that basis, then they were acting outside of their authority. It's not even perjury to call oneself Satoshi, unless it's under oath, and even then, it's not a legal name. There would be no basis for retribution, based on that.

Generally banks will close accounts if they see an avenue for 'money laundering', or any other activity for which they disapprove, or for which they believe may ultimately involve law enforcement. With Bitcoin, there's the possibility of legal action in the same vein as that which occurred with e-gold and the other popular gold and silver backed ecurrencies of the past decade. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:00:15
This isn't true. In the early 2000's, NetBank closed an account of someone I know. They didn't give him any reason, but after 1 year, almost to the day, they sent him a check for the balance.
Banks can do what they want, unless you sue them.

In Texas, there is a city of 100,000 people with a business district, industrial district, parks, neighborhoods, and all the amenities of a city, but until 2010, it did not have a government, and only formed a proto-government to avoid being annexed by Houston or Conroe. It's organized around voluntary contracts among the landowners.
Using a similar model, police and courts, and all the other things that a city needs, could be incorporated into the agreements.

This isn't deflation; this is an explosive bubble, and should end like all other such bubbles have ended. When Bitcoin stabilizes, it will still deflate a few percent each year, but it will be far more stable -- such that it will be used as a currency.
Can you imagine the alternative? An investment which doubles every month, forever? It's not possible because no one would be left to do the work.

No opening accounts or anything. Bit Instant will get bitcoins into your account within an hour. You print out a form, and then take it to any Walmart. That's it.
