Exactly this! What Bitcoin needs is a company, like a credit card company, to utilize Bitcoin as the behind the scene technology, but the user never really knows they are using it. But for the company it would be a more secure network, and easy to integrate with other payment systems as more other companies adopt Bitcoin as an option.

No, the blockchain is a public ledger, your coins are safe there. A hard fork refers to a significant change in the way NEW transactions are added to the chain. But the original chain remains intact.

That is a wildly specific case that still does not **require** bitcoin. Mainly because in a student home no one is going to agree to rent shelf space, everyone already pays rent, it's called working out your problems. But assuming this fantasy is real, the fridge sees Bob's shelf has no milk, so it uses Bob's card to buy milk, then George's shelf needs a tomato, so it sends a request for a tomato on George's credit card...still how is this a problem, pre-authorized payments are already a thing?
Also how is it more economically viable for bitcoin? Bitcoin uses a per transaction fee, so many small payments, for small grocery purchases, could end up with more net loss than a percentage system.
And for a fourth time now, my point is not about which is easier, my point is that both systems **work**. This means that there is competition in the internet of things. Bitcoin does not accomplish anything that was not already possible with credit/debit/paypal cards.
Don't act like your taking your precious time to incorrectly explain things to me.
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:19:56
but how are machines transacting with other machines noncompetitive? I could write a program for my fridge to buy with bit coins or with a credit card. Either system will function, just one will perform better
@_date: 2014-09-24 20:29:56
First off you would be that 2% charge is not a monthly fee, it's the rate the merchant pays to accept credit cards, and most US credit card contracts with merchants bar charging extra to a credit card user to use a card, thus this 2% is simply an extra 2% that the merchant charges to everyone. Second obviously you would authorize the card through the fridge computer just like any automatic payment set up with a credit card...it's not even a new thing, this already works. (at least this is true in US)
But that is really irrelevant, my point stands that a bit coin system in parallel with credit system would work, so it's not a case without competition. Because who ever owns the machine trying to make the purchase could set it up to make payments with either system.
The only system where bitcoin would be non competitive is if a robot was living on it's own, a credit company will not give the robot a card so the robot could mine and use it's own bit coins...but seeing as there is no robot demand for bitcoins this is still too far off to launch bitcoin.

Ideally yea it's impossible, in application it happens all the time. Sure there are market speculators, but the value can still become relatively stable. Stable to the point that you either need to buy and sell large volumes in a short time or smaller volumes in a long time frame to make money. 
The question is not invalid or impossible, it's simply "are you in bitcoin for the speculation to make money or would you use it even if it was simply a tool of trade and didn't gain much value over time"

Not really. If they quit their job and spent hours learning then sure maybe. But if you have a job and spend some time learning about a new thing, what was lost? A little relaxation time? It's not like you were going to work those hours for pay anyway. Risk is minimal at best.
 The first real risk takers were those who spent their savings trying to make a bitcoin startup company.

Ok I'm confused, I Googled Closed Loop economy. It's all about being environmental and not having waste products. So people are opting out of this economy, and bitcoin does what in this regard?
And war is driving inflation up because...? The rate of inflation is so small compared to the bitcoin price swings, I don't really think it's affecting bitcoin at all, at least now. Not until it's stable, then it might grow around the rate of inflation.

Not every application would, why would a fridge receive any payment? Also, why do you have this idea that a device needs it's own bank account to do anything. Exactly like any other automated transaction system if I or a company owned these machines they would be configured to send requests through our pre-authorized accounts. Then those transactions could show up on a single bank account statement with a number to identify the machine making the request.
Again my point is **still** valid, both these systems are functional. Yes, bitcoin might be easier to implement, and need less levels of security, but machine-machine transactions are not a non-competitive case.

How is this a great rewards great risk example? Early adopters could mine bit coins with a medium power CPUs and basic computers. What was the cost of downloading a program and starting to mine? Nothing. In fact only more recently has it become truly risky because investing in mining equipment might not pay off, and there have been a ton of problems with bitcoin mining equipment makers and exchanges running off with the money once they had it.

Generate wallet seems like a weird feature, I mean, I guess if you don't have one on you it can be handy, but that means the machine knows your private key. So you would need to move the transaction as soon as possible.
@_date: 2014-10-25 13:52:49
I'm going to give it a shot, but admittedly I haven't been able to get a clear explanation of what it is either. But here is what I think it is.
A side blockchain is created with different rules or functions, basically any other crypto currency, and it has a bitcoin wallet address. You can send bitcoins to this address, where a second blockchian verifies that you sent it bitcoins and gives you an appropriate number of Non-bitcoins. These non-bitcoins are then sent and received among those within this chain, but under the new rules created. Then when you want to pull your bitcoins our of the side chain you send a transaction to the chain which says you want bitcoins, the chain verifies you own the non-bitcoins, then signs a transaction from its bitcoin wallet to your bitcoin wallet. So there would always be a way to get out of the non-bitcoin assuming the network is up, if that network crashes then there could be issues. The pegging values means nothing because btc are simply relabeled to a number which makes transactions in that system easier to deal with.
 A system like this would require a way to make a private key shared by a blockchain which was created by the shared network and not any individual so the coins cannot be stolen, which can also sign transactions by using the network. And no mining of new coins could really happen because you're still limited by the number of bitcoins payed into the shared wallet.

No...it doesn't have anything to do with utility. Because I at no point did I mention utility. 
All I'm saying is that bitcoin became popular in a certain subset of the population, obviously computer programmers/enthusiasts. Those were the first adopters, and the people who started mining. It wasn't some high risk high reward investment that these people took advantage of and and the rest of the population saw and didn't try. It was simply right place/right time, and some extra effort.
This is the same way many businesses start off, people who get in on the ground floor are those who just happen to be in the same field.

Just thought I'd throw up my own conspiracy theory. CTRL + F for "financial" to get to the part of the plot about this.
"McClane and Farrell communicate with Bowman and show him an image of Gabriel. Bowman is dismayed; he tells them that the facility still running, part of the National Security Agency, was designed by Gabriel as a failsafe in the event of an attack on the nation's infrastructure. The initial attack on the FBI had triggered the download to that facility of all the financial data from stock markets, corporations, and government agencies. Gabriel apparently intends to download this information onto mobile hard drives, allowing him to undetectably siphon off billions of dollars."
In this movie, released only a little over one year before bitcoin.org was registered, and two years before the genisis block.
Basically bitcoin would have made the whole cyber attack part of the plot null, because with bitcoin everyone has all the financial data, and it's protected with cryptology, not governments.

I get what your saying now, so sure he's right... But still, maybe I'm wrong but that would take not just everyone using bitcoin but the military supply companies, and other countries literally not accepting US cash. This will probably never happen... And that doesn't mean the government still can't use bitcoin for economic warfare.

The fact that your response to most people is to say they are butthurt means you really don't have a solid argument, and you might be like 12 years old.
No matter how you look at it, as opportunity cost or money early bitcoin was not high risk. A pizza was sold for 10,000 BTC what was that loss? 10 USD? but the reward today would be about 4 million. Even opportunity cost is still quite low, although there could have been a few who risked a lot, you didn't need to risk a lot to get into it.

This is no good reason to not use them though, the vast majority of people didn't know the prefixes 200 years ago, now the population is much more well educated...well enough to handle the a simple prefix.
What I don't understand at all is why everyone wants to do this now, its not like were talking about changing the protocol here, just let bitcoin be adopted and stores will set prices according to what buyers want. Anyone paying in BTC now is most likely buying in a national currency anyway and it's being converted to BTC, for all they care the BTC amount could be displayed in hex, it doesn't matter because the BTC amount is not what the purchase decision is based on.

This brings up a question I've been thinking about. Does anyone explain public key email encryption before bitcoin? 
I feel like this is the best approach, if someone doesn't understand how asymmetric encryption, and signing works it's hard to convince them to trust this system with their money. However if you explain how public key encryption works with email, and make them realize it's trustworthy, then bitcoin is easy to explain. "Hey you know how email encryption works, yea it's kinda like that but we use your public key on a public ledger to store coins, and signatures to verify you own them."

To try to protect people. The economy goes through swings, that's inevitable, the governments job is to try to reduce those swings so that instead of a market crash we only get a dip.

How much have you traveled? Changing currency is not an issue, if you're in Europe you'll only use the euro, other than a few exceptions like Switzerland, but in those countries they typically either accept euros and just give you change in local currency. Or there are change machines on every block, like in Hungary. Also you can put your credit card in any ATM and get local currency. 
The push really shouldn't be to get tourist locations to accept bitcoin, you just need a bitcoin ATM in all airports and train stations. So that as soon as you arrive at a country you can pull out some local currency from bitcoin.

This is a terrible analogy, remember even if gold was not used as currency, it is still has some intrinsic value as a material. Being as it has the lowest resistivity of any metal, and has tons of other industrial applications. While codes written on pieces of paper have as much intrinsic value as the piece of paper.
Although I understand the idea of your argument, that the value is just what society deems it. 
The truth is though BTC is gaining popularity, and thus value fast, $1000 may or may not be near the actual settling price. I started looking in to Bit Coins roughly two weeks ago, when they were at about $600, now the price has nearly doubled, yet there has been no doubling of market use of BTC. So when people say that the value is absurd it's not that BTC can't be worth $1000, but right now that value is not really substantiated, it's a lot of speculation that's causing growth.
EDIT: Wow, everyone focused on the first part of my post and didn't even look at the sentence after it, I understand the value of bit coin. I just don't think the gold comparison is good. SiliconGuy I think said it best here, the difference is Bit Coin is 100% financial use, gold is not.

They probably have bought a lot of bit coins and are hoping to make the market go up really quick so they can sell at a high price. Then it will tank a few hundred again and they can buy cheap.
