Any information in the whois of the domain does not link to me, or any businesses we're related to. The domain was purchased and registered through our cart provider, which provides private registration by default. The resulting information in the whois is the information of the private domain register. This is pretty standard.
In the future, we'll defiantly use a rented post office box, but in our early stages it was an added expense we didn't need, so we just used a home address.

We've been operating for three weeks, all your suggestion are currently in the works! We launched the product to test the market, and early adaptors have loved it! We are currently working on a new layout, as well as some great tutorials to help inform our potential customers. 
Thanks so much for the feedback, and be sure to keep checking back for our tutorials!
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:12:44
We've done a decent amount of stress testing before we committed to this process. They hold up great. There has been a lot of interest in their durability, so I think we'll make a stress test video!
As for the chipping and flaking, this is not a problem with anodized materials, Its not like a paint, it doesn't chip and flake. It's actually pretty difficult just to scratch it.

Our cards are provide a secure way to store your coins offline. If you create a BIP38 encrypted wallet offline, we can make a custom wallet for you! They're super durable, and not to mention pretty bad ass. Most of our customers order a few and store them separately.
Check them out  (the original crypto cards!)

Hey Nobodybelievesyou!
Im sorry you still feel this way. You're clearly taking pieces of my comments and steering them as you please, and I'm not interested in engaging you any longer. We have to date, shipped over $500 in orders in approx. 3 weeks. Every one of those orders has a return address of my personal home residence, not a p.o box, or a blank address. I'm pretty sure that's fairly transparent. We're also working on some tutorials right now, so you'll even get to see my face! 
If theres anything else you would like, or if you just want to chat on the phone, contact us via the contact page, and we can help you the best we can.
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:35:44
BIP38 does a great job of making sure they stay hidden:)
@_date: 2014-01-05 23:01:51
No problem! Its mentioned on our front banner and in the product name. Thanks so much!

Hmm, that's not good. You used the link from this post and got that warning? We had posted a link a few hours before this one and incorrectly put https instead of http. This caused some problems with chrome. 
If you received this warning from the above link, could you please pm me a screen shot and let me know exactly what sort of warning you're getting, that'd be much appreciated. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:43:36
Uh oh! Haven't heard of that one yet, could you DM me with a screen shot and a description of exactly what the problem you're having is?
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:03:54
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:23:02
No, the password is not engraved. That would defeat the purpose of encrypting it. That would be the equivalent of leaving the lock combination on the back of your lock.
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:17:15
And the irony is?
@_date: 2014-05-17 20:40:22
We do! If you go through our checkout process, we accept payment via bitpay!
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:16:42
REPOSTED: In the original post the link was typed in with https instead of http and was causing people to have nasty warnings from chrome. We have reposted with the correct link! Thanks for your patience!
Hello Reddit! As promised, we're back with our newest product! Before Christmas we introduced you to our first product, laser engraved Public ID cards. After perfecting our process, we're happy to introduce you to our newest product, Cold Cards! BIP38 encrypted Cold Storage cards.
We also took some time and made our website a bit more appealing! Let us know what you think! Oh, and don't forget! Just like before, use the promo code "reddit" and get a sweet discount!
Forgot to mention that we accept Bitcoin payments via BitPay! Just choose Bitpay upon checkout!
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:10:53
Yup! No problem at all! You can just add 2 cards to your cart! 
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:06:22
Doesn't get much more personal then my home address! Feel free to swing by sometime and we can chat about world domination.
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:34:51
Glad you dig it! Dont forget to use the promo code "reddit" for a nice discount:)
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:25:42
It's been covered, but it's BIP38 encrypted. You create and encrypt the wallet, all we have is a few useless numbers.
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:54:23
We're from Canada! (judging from your user name, looks like you are to!). No listed phone number, since most of our customers are from many different times zones. If we were to list office hours to call us, they probably wouldn't end up being convenient to our customers. Email has proven to be a fool proof communication tool for a small operation like this! If you have any more concerns, feel free to shoot us a message on our contact page, we'd love to address any concerns!
Note about being located in Canada: Yes, we are located in Canada, but we charge a flat shipping rate for North America. This is because 99.9% of our customers are located in the states. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:42:46
Perfect question. You should never trust anyone with your unencrypted private keys! Thats why we only engrave cards with BIP38 (two-factor) encryption, that has been done on the customers end, not ours. We do not provide encryption, and we do not accept orders with unencrypted keys!
If you are unsure of how to encrypt your keys, check back in a couple days! We'll be putting a tutorial up!
@_date: 2014-01-05 23:26:32
good call! We're also working on some BIP38 lessons for those who are unaware of how to properly use it!
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:31:35
oh wow. Two key word typos on one banner...go team! Thanks so much for the heads up, and the order!
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:42:27
Thats why we do not offer products for unencrypted keys, and we do not offer encryption or wallet creation services. All Cold Cards are BIP38 encrypted (by the wallet owner). If you're looking for more info on BIP38 encryption, check back in a couple days, we're putting up a tutorial. 
If you're not interested in cold cards, check out our public ID cards! Great for accepting payment.
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:13:29
Yes! you're correct! They are actually engraved on anodized aluminium, and not plastic. That ensures they are extra durable! They work great as gift cards for friends aswell. Give them the preloaded card along with the two-factor password you created, and they can spend it as they please! 
Note: Im about to re-post this as the error was due to the use of https and not http in the link. If you could join the conversation in the new post, that'd be awesome!
@_date: 2014-06-10 00:01:09
Dont forget to use the promo code "reddit" for a little gift ;)
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:42:43
yup! We haven not had any troubles with any colours. So far the only tricky one is gold, which is why we have yet to offer it!
@_date: 2014-05-17 20:39:26
yup! Just shoot us an email!
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:20:55
Sorry you still feel this way! As stated earlier, shoot us an email at any time and we can answer any question you still have, or forward you along to any of our satisfied customers!
@_date: 2014-01-06 02:35:41
hm, you'll have to re-read my comment. I actually clearly stated why there is no listed phone number. I also clearly stated that you should not view a phone number as a sign of a reputable business. Its a phone number. Pretty easy to make one untraceable. 
If you're still worried, take a risk and buy a card, my home address is used as the return address. Or, better yet, get in touch with someone who has already received their product, maybe they still have their envelope. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:21:37
Hey xPatryn, the process used is actually called laser engraving. If your looking for a product that has an outcome almost like a dog tag where the image is scratched into the metal, it would cost upwards of $80/piece. It takes about an hour per card this way ( tested it out ) and the resulting product is pretty poor. Doesn't scan well and doesn't look that great. These things are durable as hell. Will defiantly be making a video soon.
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:34:46
Hey mogifax!
Thanks for the feedback! We just started selling the product so we defiantly are still in the early stages and our store front is not the most polished! We started out testing to see if there was interest, and hey! It looks like we found some. 
- re uploading a banner with proper spelling now 
- it is a generic theme, yes. We're not web designers and are not in a position at this stage to drop a bunch of dough on custom work!
- the box is gone!
- works just great:)
- still trouble shooting this one
- about/tutorials coming soon!
- we reply super fast via email! 
Please keep in mind, this is a side business and we just started to test the market three weeks ago. Our presentation may be rough around the edges, as we did not sink a large investment into a site for a product that may not have done well. We are seeing amazing interest, and are now trying to boost our professional look!  If you don't like our site now, you should have seen it the day we launched! 
Thanks so much for the feedback!
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:59:40
Uh oh, thats not good. Perfect timing of course! Thanks for the screenshot. I'm looking to the problem right now. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:52:00
Back up and running!
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:13:20

Oh I noticed it, and felt they were questions I should answer. In hindsight, it seems that I may have broken internet rule number 1: don't feed the trolls.  
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:07:21
The process used to create these cards is called laser engraving. The cards are made of a coated metal (anodized aluminum), and they're actually incredible durable. Throw these things in box of rusty nails and they'll do just fine. Before committing to this process, we did a decent amount of scratch testing, and they stood the test. Maybe a video on their durability would be good for our video series! Am I saying these cards will withstand everything? No, that would be a silly claim to make, but they can with stand a hell of a lot. Now, if you're looking for a way to store your bitcoins so they'll survive the effects of a nuclear explosion, I may suggest searching for another method!
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:22:49
Sorry! Should have mentioned that we do accept Bitcoin via BitPay. We had a notice on our original site, but it seems we forgot to add it to our new site! Currently, we accept both paypal and bitpay as forms of payment. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:41:35
I'll be the first to admit. Our home brewed graphics created by not so artistic people are far from perfect! Sexy graphics are defiantly in the works.In the mean time, I'd be interested learn a little bit about white space! (seriously).
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:43:40
The problem your referring to is not due to a chipping or flaking of the treated aluminum. The anodizing does not chip or flake. If the metal sustains significant force that may result in scratching, the untreated aluminum beneath may be exposed. If the same thing was done to a piece of untreated aluminum, you'd have the same result, but since it is a uniform colour it is less noticeable.
Aluminum is obviously not scratch proof, but the cards still hold up great. They'd do just fine in your pocket with your keys, but maybe not so great against your bandsaw. We'll be posting a durability video sometime soon!
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:30:24
Oh jeeze! Right on the banner! I have had multiple people let me know about a typo but I couldn't find it!...right there...right there on the damn banner! Thanks so much!
@_date: 2014-05-17 17:30:31
Hello everyone! Just thought we would submit another post with our updated price (now our public ID and cold cards are the same price!). As with our previous thread, if you use the promo code "reddit", you'll get a friendly discount!
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:57:42
Hmm, thats no good. Could you PM me with a screen shot?
@_date: 2014-01-05 23:00:32
Glad you like it! Yes, I heard about the other guys going under! They created their site 24 hours after out first reddit post, and I guess they were having some troubles! We did a lot of testing before launching our product to the public to make sure everything worked right the first time! Dont forget to use the coupon code "reddit" when you check out!
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:45:27
Not that easy! All keys must be BIP38 (two-factor) encrypted by the wallet owner before sending the information along to us. We DO NOT accept any orders with keys that are unencrypted, for obvious liability reasons. If you are unfamiliar with two-factor encryption, check back in a couple days, we're creating a tutorial!
@_date: 2014-05-17 20:39:35
Thanks:) 
@_date: 2014-03-22 18:05:07
We make some pretty sweet cold storage options. Checkout crypto-cards.com
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:36:57
Thanks for the comments! We're working as best as we can to work out any kinks in the system!
As for the possibility of an extra text field, we'll defiantly take that into consideration if we decide to re-format the cards. This option is low on the priority list though, as adding another variable to the card can get messy.
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:35:48
I couldn't be less evasive. I've responded to every one of your questions and informed you that everyone that has purchased anything from us knows where I live. At this point, I honestly cannot tell if you are trolling or not. I'm just going to stop responding, and any curious customer reading this thread that still has questions, get in touch!
@_date: 2014-01-06 02:19:52
The original question that was asked before the post was edited was 
"Where are you registered as a business? I see no location or phone number. I'm very hesitant to buy from a company unless there is some accountability back to them."
So that question was answered just fine! Heres my response to the newly edited comment:
Im unsure why you would see a phone number as something ensures legitimacy. For example: pay as you go phones are untraceable, but since its a phone number, its more transparent? Sorry I'm just a bit confused. If you'd really like to talk on the phone, pm me and we'll give you a call, no problem. As I said, a phone number is not an effective communication tool for us right now, as we'd probably only be able to answer it 10% of the time.
As for the encrypted keys, once the order has been processed, all records of the encrypted private IDs are erased as an extra precaution. Any orders that are placed without encryption are cancelled, erased and the order is refunded (has yet to happen, but I say this just incase someone does something silly like that).
Feel free to ask any more questions:)
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:03:59
Hey joe!
Thanks so much for the feedback! We're definitely considering re-arranging the current layout. I actually really like your design! We've chosen to go a little bit larger than normally necessary, as we've found the shiny, coloured aluminium was sometimes unreliable if the QR code was to small. Soon we'll have another design option, and provide both the new and current one as options. Which ever one does best will stay!
Thanks again for the advice!
@_date: 2014-01-05 23:04:08
Edit: woops, realized you were responding to the comment above! my mistake!
@_date: 2014-05-19 20:40:05
Sure do! We ship internationally!
@_date: 2014-05-19 20:39:48
For our Cold Cards, we will only accept orders which have a BIP39 encrypted private key. This ensures nobody has access to your coins unless they know the password that goes along side the BIP38 key.
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:48:36

Hello Reddit! We started making these awesome laser(lazzzeerr) engraved bitcoin cards a while back and sold them to friends/locals. After realizing other people thought they were cool to, we decided to show them to the internet! The cards are made with anodized aluminum and are custom made with your personal QR code. The cards are about the size of a credit card and are super durable! 
We have tons more awesome products coming in the next few weeks so keep checking back. If you have any suggestions or requests shoot us a message or contact us through the site. We already have some custom orders for other alt coins!
Lastly, if you decide these cards are cool enough for you, use the coupon code "reddit" and you will receive 15% off!
Sorry if this classifies as spam as this is our company and yes, we profit if you buy products from the link, but we thought it was something the r/bitcoin community would enjoy, so we thought we would share!
Feedback greatly appreciated!
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:32:11
Yes of course! we can laser engrave a custom logo on the back aswell. sorry you missed the coupon code! message me if you order another with a custom logo and ill send you a 30% off code to even it out!

Perfect question! As of right now we do not offer private ID cards. The cards shown are ONLY public ID cards. We do not want to take on the liability that comes with private IDs at this moment. You'll notice we ask you email us if interested in private ID cards. We are setting up a mailing list for private IDs, and when the time comes that we can safely provide it as a service, we'll let everyone know! 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:31:25
Working on it! Shoot us an email and we'll let you know when they're ready! 
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:04:48
Where are you located? Right now its crunch time for the postal service so its tough for us to guarantee an xmas delivery. Shoot us an email and we may be able to provide expedited delivery!
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:58:05
These cards are not like paper wallets, as they only have public IDs printed on them. Paper wallets are offline storages with both your public and private IDs. These cards are receive only cards, meaning since it does not have your private ID, you cant use it to send money. Your friend or customer can scan the QR code on the card, and send funds to the wallet the card is associated with.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:30:24
Send us a message in the contact page, and we'll get you sorted! Show us what you'd like and we'll tell you if we can make it look good!
