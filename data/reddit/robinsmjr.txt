No, they were sold in 4 or 5 chunks and they went for tens of millions but still at a discount compared to market rates.

No, they were auctioned off like any other seized assets.

It was probably a one time thing or something the dev staff does rarely. Our company makes little personalized keep sakes for special visitors as well.

Twitter is weird sometimes. If you change the @ you will lose the verification but if you change the display name its 50/50 if it stays or you lose it. I remember in the past a lot of people complained about the display name thing losing the verification so maybe they made it a lot more lenient?

Very true i looked up the story again to see how many there were and what year it was. You wont fucking believe this it was 7,500 BTC in 2013. Personally i would have dumped all that the second it hit $1000 a Bitcoin. Who could imagine it going anywhere higher then gold. Now worth over $21.1 Million. I would have jumped off the golden gate bridge.

Because i am not that worried. I plan on searching the whole day tomorrow. Sometimes its better to be a little optimistic i guess, i mean i'm sure it has to pop up somewhere around here. Its a large sum yes, but not as tragic as the guy who accidentally threw away $8 million in bitcoins.
