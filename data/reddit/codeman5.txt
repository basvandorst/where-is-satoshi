Why is it BS? If babyboomers are passing down their money after dying wouldn't it make total sense that they would be? It's not like all that money is just going to sit there not earning anything. It's going to grow and pickup where their parents left off. And who cares who is buying the most bitcoin? It's not a race and it makes a lot of older generations look silly claiming that millennials are too dumb to be in bitcoin when a simple google search shows that millennials are way more likely to be the ones buying.
@_date: 2019-11-05 19:50:21
Lol. You have a position that needs filled?
@_date: 2019-11-12 20:31:26
Lol. Most people from every generation don't own any but any google search will tell you that millennials are the most likely to be buying bitcoin over older generations.
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:46:54
Lol. Yeah, maybe they should get a fucking clue. /s

Because I don't subscribe to what you say about the hypothalamus causing fibromyalgia. So in my mind these are totally different things that can't be compared. I have not seen concrete evidence of anything causing fibromyalgia.

Coinbase is fine if you don't mind waiting for your money to clear before buying on the exchange but still, other exchanges are cheaper and if you want to buy instantly then cash app is way cheaper.
@_date: 2019-11-01 14:12:42
This. I second cashapp. I would also just put it all in now but it's up to you. I think bitcoin will reach a point soon where it steadily goes up towards the halving so I personally don't think there will be many dips this low. DCA works fine if the price is heading down but if not than you aren't making as much.
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:13:09
Here's a couple articles I found in 2 seconds on this thing called the internet with my millennial brain.
Article from Forbes that states 20% of millennials claim they own some bitcoin. Only 2% of those 65 and older claim to have any bitcoin: [
Article that states that millennials are 3 times more likely to invest cryptop then gen x: [

That's a different thing entirely. There is a difference between an actual impairment and something created by belief. I take it you don't believe that a person's thinking can effect their body so really there is nothing more to argue about but if you want to broaden your horizons then look it up.

Agreed. Same with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. Everyone has inattention, tiredness, and pain. The issue is that these special people can't slip into someone else's body to realize they're just like everyone else except other people don't complain and just get on with their lives. I too was once a whinny bitch that blamed my problems on other things but then I grew up.
@_date: 2019-11-21 01:17:42
I can argue with it because a person convincing themselves something is real will have a noticable effect on the brain. I believe that fibromyalgia just like the others is imagined and until someone tells me the ACTUAL cause of these things I will continue to believe that. Giving into this delusion that people have is only hurting them.
@_date: 2019-11-11 20:05:24
There is still a generational factor imo and I think this is backed up by simple web searches that show that millennials are much more into crypto than older generations.

"Yes I know this site bcz I'm taking xanax from Daniel he is very sweet and you know I scammed many time before but now I have legit site Daniel deliver me which I place order on website really Daniel you are very sweet thank you." You commented this 4 hrs ago. Do you also take something from Daniel for your memory loss? Lol.
@_date: 2019-11-12 20:34:34
Well regardless, a simple google search will tell you that millennials are the most likely to be buying bitcoin over older generations. I don't know why older generations seem to get defensive over this since it doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2019-11-21 06:36:29
I can't comment on the breast milk thing as I have not done any research on it but I know for a fact that a cause of fibromyalgia is not broadly accepted. If a cause is found and agreed upon by the scientific community I will eat my words. Perhaps if I knew someone with it, as you do, I might feel differently but where I currently sit I can't believe it as I have had experience with the other conditions I mentioned which appear to be in the same boat.
@_date: 2019-11-01 14:48:58
I couldn't say since I've always just used a hardware wallet which is what I'd recommend for storage.
@_date: 2019-10-14 18:58:28
I say yes. Anytime before the halving is a great time.

This. Have friends buy it and sell it to you in cash. Then they should claim their bitcoin was stolen and if possible take a capital loss on their taxes while spending the cash.

You're going to want Trump if bitcoin goes up. Democrats want to increase capital gains while Trump wanted to decrease them.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:50:47
That's what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:43:45
I personally feel that while volume is up there, they are probably selling not buying. While watching Bitfinex's orders, which is headquartered in Hong Kong btw, I noticed more selling there than other exchanges as that news broke. Probably worried about their ability to be able to swap their bitcoin into something more usable or something. So more trading but less buying.
@_date: 2019-10-03 14:42:38
Yes. In the US, assuming it's long term capital gains, I think the taxes on that would be like $22,500. Which is just ridiculous imo.
@_date: 2019-10-03 13:38:32
While the volume may be high I'm not sure they are buying. If you look at Bitfinex's orders, which is headquartered in Hong Kong btw, there is more selling going on. I'm more inclined to believe they are worried about the future of their bitcoin so they are getting rid of it. I wouldn't be surprised if that's partially to blame for bitcoin remaining steady and not rising.
@_date: 2019-10-09 13:06:47
I definitely didn't but it's cool if you did. I'm sure you grew out of it.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:51:14
I agree with this. You can't really use hash rate in itself to predict price as that is determined more by demand. Bitcoin has a set supply coming in and when you don't have enough demand to meet that supply the price will go down regardless of hash rate.
@_date: 2019-10-28 14:22:33
You aren't kidding. That's why I'm in Bitcoin. So I might eventually not have to get up until I want. Lol.
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:36:08
Not gonna happen.
@_date: 2019-10-25 20:32:44
Lol. I'm sure that goes for many around here. It was pretty thrilling watching that. I'm getting closer to breaking even. I doubt it'll be much longer.
@_date: 2019-12-20 17:49:41
That makes sense. And then the person that was gifted the bitcoin would also have to pay capital gains/losses once they sell based on the amount it was worth at the time of the gifting.
@_date: 2019-12-12 15:46:41
I think it's easy to see why they would believe that. Any extra spending flows to the top and because demand is rising so is the cost of living and of products. So while the rich are getting richer everyone else has to deal with a more expensive living that offsets their small rise in wages. I guess if you take into consideration that there are more jobs the argument could be made that it helps people overall but a lot of people that already have jobs just feel like they aren't getting any wealthier with a stronger economy while the rich do.
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:12:42
I use cash app to buy and I'll use whatever exchange is cheapest/easiest to sell.
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:51:12
I'm aware of that however bank interest rates do help for money that needs to remain liquid and they have been declining. People were very lucky in the past.
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:08:34
That's what I love about bitcoiners. So many nice people willing to give.
@_date: 2019-12-12 18:46:08
For sure. That'll always happen.
@_date: 2019-12-12 20:16:18
I agree. I don't believe interest rates will ever raise again over the long term but people should become more responsible.
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:17:43
That's very true. It's just too bad that interest rates are low and that alot of people have little money to save. But yes, if you can afford it saving is very important.
@_date: 2019-09-26 02:54:13
I say good luck OP. And to us all. You are young and can stand to gamble on this with such possible returns. If it doesn't work, fuck it. You'll find a way to make it eventually. As I see it you'll have about until the next having, which is like 200 and some days, to see if bitcoin will follow the same trends and then you can decide to stay in or not.
@_date: 2019-09-30 20:23:46
Agreed. Capital gains tax is bullshit too.
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:09:31
What makes you think that? It would go against the previous trend of taking off after a halving which is in May 2020 so just curious.
@_date: 2019-09-27 13:06:46
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:38:36
Or perhaps the hashrate drop and the sudden movement of so much bitcoin are related. What if a large mining operation shut down to switch to new and better hardware and sold it's bitcoin to cover costs? If this was true then what happened is nothing to worry about.
