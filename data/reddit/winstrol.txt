not with these transactions fees 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:20:03
....redic, do you even use bitcoin? i have transactions not going thru at 512 bytes. Literally a $20 fee on $400 it's been stuck for about 2 days now. Bitcoin is taking a dive.

@_date: 2014-12-25 04:24:45

I love how people can't stand to see these pop up. Simply because they can't seem to grasp something maybe wrong with having the federal reserve bankroll our country(not saying it is or ist). But anyone who has a brain knows it's only a matter of time before shits hits the fan like it almost did in 2008, be it 10 years or 100 years this can only go on for so long. Open a godam history book because history likes to repeat itself &amp; your in for a rude awakening if you think everything is going to be fine and dandy. Hell maybe the fed will print money out for social security so we can worship the fed instead of hating it :P.

Maybe with a new crypto currency not now thou.

Shame. Silkroad is nothing compared to evolution that is another animal. All goes back to the "war on drugs".

I have a bitcoin wallet that has over 700 bitcoins i had from pre 2012. Ive never really thought that i need to report these coins to the IRS since i havent really touched that wallet nor the computer since(in storage). I also don't really have plans to use nor touch these coins until the future. Is what am doing illegal? Am guessing am hiding an asset that was worth nearly a million dollars just a year ago so just wondering.

Pretty sure your a fortune teller. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:27:03
Hmm never thought about satellite internet, i wonder how easy it is to pin point the user if they are tracking them.

Cue people claiming the fed is an amazing part of life &amp; will be here for future generations.

Would it be possible to reach the jury since they are there and identify them and try to talk them about the facts of this case? Just wondering if these guys are being protected from outside sources talking to them since his fate depends on them. Might come off a silly question but how possible is this in the realm of possibilities? 
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:03:34
Depends. Do they take my fingerprints &amp; scan my eye and ask me to bring a sample of my semen to buy a coin? No thanks. Alot of us don't use these ATM's because they are extremely intrusive on privacy. If you could put cash in and get coins out with nothing else in between &amp; a nominal fee am sure it would be more popular.

Dark Wallet. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:48:22
Why don't you just sell your website for loads of cash? Wtf lol. The exchange is easily worth six figures. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 10:03:33
lol this is sad...
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:08:24
I didt mean the press reaching them. I mean after they are done with jury duty are they allowed to google things or can a friend talk to them about the case &amp; discuss details? I mean your in the courtroom do they see things you dont? Are they only soppose to use the evidence the prosecutor shows them? 
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:02:11
[This guy has to give the machine his phone scan,photo id scan. All just to buy a bitcoin.] ( Who the hell thought this would be a profitable ATM? 
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:10:21
secretly extracting gold ? jesus how the hell does that work
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:44:44
The fed? how did that happen ?
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:00:31
str8 wreckage mate.

This is very true. It's crazy to think that somebody out there probably has a million bitcoins in their wallet. 
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:07:41
Money from Venezuela...ouch that must sting
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:11:52
I don't think anyone has made a good bitcoin site for local sales yet. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:18:25
Scary when you think about why they would do this.
