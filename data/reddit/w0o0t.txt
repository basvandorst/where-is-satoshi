Soros is behind much of the immigration crisis in Europe.
He does it for political purposes to change Europe at its core.
His open society has been very successful to this end.
His color revolutions has thrown every country affected into deeper states of unrest and chaos, just look at the results of the "Arab spring".

Power structures are the problem!
Like these ones: 
Fallos-like structures build by men and for me...
Ehh, what is this?
***"In Sweden, women, for example, use more electricity for activities related to cooking and household care than men do..."***
...built for women to slave in the kitchen!
We have to take the power structures down to free women from time saving equipment like washing machines and dishwashers!

When we rely on the password as the only thing that stands between hackers and peoples bitcoins, people will lose their coins. Most people do not memorize a new completely random password and long enough password.
For normal users reused passwords ends up in password databases after websites (or even governments) are hacked where a password can be linked to an identity: IP, browser fingerprint, cookies, physical location, physical device etc etc.

It was reported in ***NOVEMBER***!
Nothing was done. I assume that the developers of Electrum have at minimum a basic level of understanding of the technology they build meaning: ***the developers knew full well what could be done over the RPC connection***.
They only reacted when the issue got attention when Travis from Google's Project Zero sent them a message saying basically (my translation): *What the bleep guys are you doing here? Peoples money is on the line for Gods sake fix this.*
It's all there in the Github bug report.

I dont expect anyone to do stuff for me, the world owes me nothing. I would start my own country if I could truly buy land, but true land ownership is extremely rare. All I want is an opt out, they leave me alone and I leave them alone, but to the communists that is utterly unacceptable, they would rather kill me then leave me alone.
I have always been contributiong, I create value, I build things, and I will continue doing so. I pay for myself and many more by the value I create.
I was living in Sweden, they robbed me of more than 80% of my labor (all counted) so I left, but no place is free.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:23:46
Do you enjoy all the people you get killed for your tax dollars?
You have to understand: the govenment is just a bunch of people living off of the hard work of others, stealing value they did not create to do things the people they stole from does not condone.
For anything else there are simply fees for usage of private property.

That is the immorality of governemnts, I guess the responsibility for all those deaths is hard to carry.
Yes a miniscule part comes back to me, lets be *very* generous and say its 1% of my taxes in some form benefits me. I would pay for that if I had the option to opt out of the rest.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:26:22
Taxation is actually closer to robbery than theft. It is extorsion under the threat of voilence. That is just the definition of words, you cant argue with that.
You seem to belive that once you name something "the government" it is above morals, or even, in this case, above definitions of words. That is simply nothing but deep indoctrination by state funded education.

It would be a long and boring post to list it all, so let me give a few examples from Sweden:
They just built a new hospital in Stockholm (New Karolinska), by massive incompetence the and extreme wastefullness the thing cost as much as 1.7 Burj Khalifa to build, and costs are still going up.
Alot of money is wasted on govermental aid programs where Swedish politicians tries to push their agenda on 
the world like sending gender pedagogies to war-torn Ukraine, or supporting various corrupt regimes in Africa.
Shall we talk roads? 1992 to save 10-15 minutes train ride time the Swedish government started to build a train tunnel, the project cost many times the budgeted amount and instead of 3 years it took 23 years to build it. Oh and they also messed up the ground water levels, poisoned the workers and the surrounding land. 
Swedish schools are indoctrination centers, where everyone have to belive in state mandated values (värdegrunden).
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:35:13
What do you want? A pie chart? 
Sweden is a small place, what you call corner cases are large posts in the budget.
Just to pay for that hospital it takes the taxes of 277 000 swedish workers with a salery of €3250 (before taxes) working for an entire year, and mind this is only one hostpital and they then dont pay for anything else.
EDIT: Forgot to add, that is 2,7% of the swedish population.

This is the govenmnet you are talking about. It is not meant to make sense, it's only meant to make you miserable. Assuming that any laws are fair of resonable is really stupid, it is only a play of power, they will take all they can get away with.

I'm one of those people. I'm not rich but I pay for my self, I'm a parasite to no one and I take pride in that. I never take stolen government welfare money.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:14:07
I take pride in not taking govenemnt funding. I pay for my own expenses (including healthcare) whenever there is a choise for me to do so.
I left my native Sweden as taxation there is going from mad to insane (72% straight off being self employed, and another 25% for anything I buy after that).
It was not even possible in Sweden to bare my own costs.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:29:29
Taxation is theft, anyone supporting it is partly responsible for the immorality.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:36:42
I'm under the impression that another world is possible.
Governments running things are incredibly inefficient. They are slow, wastefull and byrocratic. That they are responsible for almost all wars does not speak in their favor. Look up the word demicide.
Counting all the taxes I have paid, I have paid for many lifetimes worth of roads and firefighters, so even by your standards I'm far from a parasite. But like a bullied kid who finally decides to stand up for himself have I decided that enough is enough, I will defent the value of my labor against the robbers.

This is really it, is it not?

This is the real hipocracy.

They do have lots of guns, one has to act accordingly to save oneself from trouble. I would not condemn a person paying extorsion money under the threat of violence (tax), but to support taxation is highly immoral.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:24:02
The world is insanely complicated, but twisting things into victim blaming by saying that the one who manages not to get robbed is the parasite - that is a lie that comes from the propaganda of state run schools.
Follow the logical chain of definitons and you will see this is true, but the hard part is accepting it due to the conditioning through fear of the implications from this simple truth. We are not logical beings and this is exploited on a massive scale.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:16:01
It is not hard to look at the numbers. I get very little back compared to the size of my contribution, then on top of they they steal even more through inflation. Naming it robbery in the abstract is not unjustified when the alternative always boils down to state violece at the end, they will place me in jail if I don't do as they say.
"we learn as children" from state schools, that taxation to pay for wars (and indoctrinate children) is morally a good thing.
For sure there is something to say about local community and family. I do care for them and I do contribute to them, there is absolutely no need for the centralized state to facilitate my suport for my community.

The distance to the moon is 384402 km.
*Let's get this number into perspective.*
A somewhat fast **walker** can walk about 40km in a day, at this pace it would then take 9610 days to the moon or a little less than 27 years.
A **car** traveling at highway speed of 120km/hour can travel 2400km in a 20 hour period, at this speed it would take 133.5 days to the moon.
The cruising speed **airliner** is about 0.26 km/s, now the moon is only 1.48 million seconds away, or a mere 17 days.
But let's face it, if we're going to the moon we won't get there without a **rocket**. Already in 1959 the Soviet Luna 1 probe went to the moon in 36 hours. The fastest trip to the moon ever was NASA's New Horizons Pluto mission at 58,536 km/h it only took 8 hours and 35 minutes!
Hodl on to your buts, we might arrive at the moon faster than expected!
*Then we go to Mars.*

Yeah, unjustified levels of violence is always reported and loved by the media. Unjustified seizures of property for someone the media considers a criminal by default - not so much, normally such cases will go unpublished.

You have a wired view of how your tax money works.
Once it's stolen from you, you have no control over it anymore, at this point considering that it is 'yours' is just you fooling yourself.
You may say you have control over it through the voting system but if you were to try to quantify your influence over how it is used compared to the bureaucrats influence, your influence is so small so it can effectively be discounted.
Now, supposedly laws are determining its use, but you have to understand that in the bureaucratic system every bureaucrat at every level it goes through has influence over its use. Lets say for illustrative purposes that this influence is 10% at every level, then this influence accumulates and over time lawyers will be more and more inclined to side with the state rather than you when the two are in conflict, for example when there is a promotion on the line.
This influence is a corrupting factor over time for the very reason that the lawyers are payed by the state and not by you, their incentives are not set right.

Google has been running these kinds of scams for a long time. For most every ICOs the top result on Google would be a scam version of the ICO. Google knew these very well and still persisted in pushing these kind of ads, it cannot be considered as anything other than willfull ignorance at best. Most of the ICOs themselves were plusible scams, but this does not excuse Googles behaviour.
When Google finally decided to not advertise for crypto was great. Google cannot be trusted.

Thanks for sharing, another example of how the governments needs to be stopped, and also nice to see a real world example of Bitcoin delivering on one of its promises.
What hurts the most reading your story is the cynical nature in which they made you accept a bargin. With your legal system being the way it is they use your rationality against you to avoid justice.

@_date: 2018-03-18 00:36:03
Ah yes, I see your point about the possible double standard here.
A few observations, first I would hold Google to a higher standard in terms of expected turnaround times for serious fraud reports as they are simply playing in another league when it comes to resources and hold what is almost a monopoly on information, second (taking OP's word at face value here - which I think is fair until there are good reasons to doubt his words) it looks like they did actually take down the scam-ads as soon as they were notified (even to the point of defying the feds command in order to protect their customers [and themselves]) where I personally know for a fact that Google has waited for weeks to do the same when they have been notified of scams and that this pattern repeated itself for *every single ICO that was launched*. I think we do have to distinguish the scale here. Given Googles resources and their ability to respond very quickly if they feel like it (in other cases) it is hard to explain away their behavior as anything other than willful ignorance.
Now, that said, the world of affiliate marketing is generally rotten to it's core where the success of a site is normally an indicator of it's creators low moral values, especially in the area of multi level marketing and get rich quick schemes scams abound. And so this of course informs the suspicion that OP might have been in this crowd, however not having looked into their sites personally I will reserve judgment in this case as I could see it being at least theoretically thinkable that they ran such a site successfully with integrity (however unlikely).
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:34:22

@_date: 2018-03-17 02:02:54

Not being afiliated with Google is s good thing. The values they stand for are fake news, scams and the elimination of free speech and privacy.

Haha, yeah that's true. But there are things that could make them state in a less bad way and if so those are all good avenues to pursue.
Where history is the guide the endpoint seem to always be that the  the state states in an extremely statfull way, which will be extremely painful to live through. There are many ways they can hurt crypto users (and endpoint security is today extremely bad so using them anonymously is extremely hard).

Most people in my native Sweden think the way you talk about it, yet very similar things are happening there. I will assume that your country is the same, you just don't know about it as media is not reporting these things. I wish I could talk about what I know personally but like OP I have to stay quiet at this point in order to protect others.
