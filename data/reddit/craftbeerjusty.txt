Hi - The festival is on for ten days, so that merchants have plenty of time to accept Bitcoin and hopefully once they've done it for ten days, they'll just see it as normal and will continue accepting it afterwards. Additionally, it gives the public plenty of time to visit merchants. 
There are a lot of events taking place during the ten days. Some are TBC, but the vast majority are not. 
Anyway, if you're in London, please support the merchants who have taken the step to accept Bitcoin or attend an event and that will help all of us that love Bitcoin as it's these small steps that matter for Bitcoin to become more mainstream.

Thanks for all the comments. 
 - Yes, adding to coinmap is on our list. Thanks for that. 
 - See you there!
 - Will post to Reddit's Bitcoin page as well - thanks for the tip!
 - Good British beer is definitely a good reason to visit London. Go on... 
 - haven't been yet, but will be and have been in touch with the guys that run it. Hadn't thought about people selling bitcoins to newbies. Great idea! Love it. Do you have any ideas on how you think it would best work? If so, message me please.

The more merchants that support Bitcoin, the better for Bitcoin as it helps spread the word. With my business, I have actively helped newbies purchase Bitcoin, dispelled silly myths spread by mainstream press, advertised Bitcoin, Bitcoin news and information to a database of people that don't normally engage with it. I have helped people understand more about Bitcoin who may never have had the opportunity to otherwise. I have spread my enthusiasm for AltCoins and as a result people have purchased Bitcoin and participated in the economy who would never have done without my business encouraging them to take 'the plunge'. Being negative to me and my small business does not help anyone.

We actually started accepting Bitcoin last month for our Pop-up Pub. 
What a fantastic way to get to know Bitcoiners - over a delicious British craft beer! Take a look at our [CoinDesk review]( 
Anyway, we realised that we hadn't shared that we are also accepting Bitcoin for our beer tasting experiences and private events (stag do's, corporate events etc). So if you're in the mood for great tasting beer and would like to support British breweries, you know where to come :) [The Craft Beer Social Club](
