Okay so inflation is the reason why currencies lose value.
So my question is, do people really want a currency that appreciates rather than one that depreciates??
Think of the economic affects of an appreciating currency. Suddenly everyone will minimize spending on stuff, minimize investment and maximize saving. Businesses will have to pay people less and less because not only does 1 unit of currency buys way more stuff, people don’t spend as much of their money.
This whole notion of currency being equivalent to an appreciating asset drives me up the wall. If this Bitcoin become a benchmark currency to do everything in, the economic fall out is going to be catastrophic.
It is GOOD when currencies lose value in a slow manner!!! 
Please don’t use Venezuela as an example against me. That’s an example of EXTREME depreciation in a short period of time and that’s bad. The British pound’s depreciation is good kind of depreciation.

Lol! wishful thinking much?
Most millennials in my circle are SUPER skeptical about crypto’s future. I don’t think most millennials even know how they could go about owning a bitcoin.

This is not at all the same kind of comparison!!
Stocks =/= Bitcoin (or any other currency)
Maybe a comparison to some metal would be more accurate. I hope this isn’t too complicated to understand for whatever primitive mind created this post.

You can’t have it both ways.
Freedom from the laws is the main argument for bitcoin. And that the protections are built into its decentralized design

Whenever I see crypto enthusiasts get pissed about the lack of protection or the lack of ethical behaviour in the crypto market it makes me laugh.
The main argument for crypto is that it is beyond the legal framework, unregulated and uncontrolled.
You wanted the Wild West of currency markets and now that you have it you want the legal framework to protect your investment.
This is hypocrisy or crypto investors are naive

Unregulated environment is the EXACT reason why right wing libertarians are pro-cypto. Any system of this design by its very nature will attract scammers, pump/dumpers, copy cats (BTC/BCH) and of course the anti government types.
Again, you can't have an unregulated environment and expect everyone to behave and be all ethical

I think it is even more ignorant to be so entrenched in your views you refuse to look at the other side of the coin
