Puts downvote proof hat on.
Bitcoin isn't a currency, it's a commodity traded like a currency, but it's a highly volatile one.
What defines a currency is demand. Demand for a currency exists through the obtaining of it through labour, the need for it to pay taxes and the ease of which it can be traded for day to day purchases such as a pint of milk or a loaf of bread.
Bitcoin needs to be purchased through regular currency or "mined". It's demand is based solely on a notion of value, but no actually true requirement.
It could easily be replaced in the morning if an identical concept was introduced but with more wide ranging acceptance and usefulness.
If Bitcoin ever became a threat to a legitimate currency, it could be undermined and be rendered valueless in a matter of seconds.

You may well make a lot of money, and I genuinely hope you do, but what you're doing is pretty much betting your entire life savings on black on a roulette table.... If it works out you'll feel like a genius, if it doesn't, you'll be called an idiot, but no matter what way you look at it, it's an incredibly risky investment over which you have absolutely no control.
Best of luck with it, like I said I genuinely hope for your sake it works out for you, but a word of warning, winning, if you do, is addictive, every investment is a gamble and inevitably gamblers will always lose, so knowing when to get out is key as every industry, investment and commodity will collapse over a long enough time frame. The only way to win is to quit when you're on top and the toughest time to walk away is when you're winning, just keep that in mind.
I would suggest setting a target for overall value when you will be willing to walk away and if/when you achieve that goal, no matter what, walk away. That's my advice, for what it's worth.
