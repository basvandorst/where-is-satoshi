I’d venture to say that he probably only claims to skim the book and read the table of contents. He probably doesn’t even do that.

If anything he just proved how unstoppable Bitcoin is. You can’t hold anyone directly accountable. 
Where as Libra is well.. linked to everything..

I love that guy on twitter talking about Bitcoin as if it’s an organization and that it’s a bubble that will need a buy out from the government when it pops.
Nice try..

Isn't this destroying that value of bitcoins? 
You can't get something for nothing. It's exactly what happened with the housing market crash. You can't put money in a magic box, Shake it around, and pull out twice as much money. 
Eventually that super low price for 1 bitcoin on mtgox is going to level out with all the other markets and sink even lower.

The whole RFID thing is a little fat fetched to me. Why would the government waste their resources when they can just utilize the RFID chips the cellphone manufacturers are put in all the smartphones? 
Everybody wants them so bad.. Payment processing will be so easy.. OMG..
We already can't trust the government not to snoop on our devices.. They aren't going to inject the RFID's in our skin. They will market them in such a way that everyone will be begging for them.

You just blessed me with knowledge.
@_date: 2014-05-04 15:06:10
You don't get the point. Why would they inject it in our skin when they can just use our controllable lust and greed to make us feel like we can survive without one. 
What one saying is that they don't even need to waste their time lining us up at our post offices to get a chip when We're already lining up infront of electronic stores fighting for them..

Facebook is like China. It just takes existing ideas and makes them more accessible and cheaper to your parents and grandparents.

John Mcafee, Tim Draper, Tai Lopez and, Jordan Belfort.. the Mount Rushmore of shitty financial advice.
I wish these four guys would stop making it onto the Crypto subreddits and then being met with positivity.

Mining will be expensive. The electricity it requires is extremely high. Picking up a second job for month is less work.

Yes. Through Coinbase or other exchanges. I only have 1/10th of a coin. That I bought in pieces. But since I bought it my investment is up 50%
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:00:47
I see one of these posts every other day

“If you are a United States resident, your Coinbase USD Wallet is covered by FDIC insurance, up to a maximum of $250,000.” -from their own website.
FDIC only insures Fiat money.
They claim everything else is insured but do not elaborate on it.

Stupid. Why do people say things like this.

Just buy some. It’s easier and less work.

No it’s not. The only really negative thing that he said about crypto is that at this point people are just using it to gamble. Which is kind of true.
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:49:08
There’s a lot of scum on that list. Just saying

Wishy washy crypto investors think in 2 day cycles.
Omg I’m going to be rich and omg the world is ending because bitcoin dropped by $30.

I really hope that crypto destroys Bank of America and Wells Fargo.
