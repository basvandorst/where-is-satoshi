Agreed. Just been on my mind.

If you end up in the highest tax bracket (39.6%) you can save 2.6% by waiting to 1/1/18 when it drops to 37%. 
Of course, the value will likely be different then.

I'm six weeks in. Just keep reading and reading and reading. It will all start to make sense. "I'm way late" has been echoing in these halls for quite a long time I have learned. If it goes to a $1b you are still early. Put a plan on paper. Decide what you believe in and what you don't. Only invest what you are totally willing to lose. Dollar cost averaging is a great way to eliminate the emotional rollercoaster. And good luck!

To be clear. I was referencing the tax rate for the highest bracket dropping from 39.6% to 37%. Which as of right now, is supposed to be the rate for 2018. Actually forgot about the capital gains tax. But that is based on length of ownership, not calendar year.

Love the post and love the commitment. I agree rolling with consensus but I think we should keep in mind that those that understand the technical side, and it sounds like you do, need to protect the "community" from self interest that can very easily make it's way into the space.
Seems to me like the "The Money" is here and it is not going anywhere. The original intent of the OGs will need to be protected and I think that if we do not feed the "big dogs" they will eat what they want. I like to think that we can't be touched by greed and malintent but it looks like "we" are already being inundated with it. (Roger Ver, DCG, S2X, Wall St.)
Implementing and protecting the spirit of Satoshi and those that started this movement will likely require protection from this greed and malintent. Looks like they are here and they are forging alliances. NO2X was a huge victory but it was likely a tiny little battle. Great wars will come. We will need people like you and others to speak up and fight back. I think that sticking with the consensus of "the protectors" will matter but when the consensus becomes that of the miners (believe me, if it don't make them more money, they will not be onboard) and the greedy, the minority just might become those that have Satoshi's best interest at heart. Remember "life finds a way". Sadly, so does capitalism.
Note: These are just some thoughts. I know that there is likely more protection in place than I understand. Please don't murder me. Thanks. ;-)
Edit: Realized I was being a little too sure of myself and definitive. Edited to reflect more accurate my understanding.

Would a different exchange likely be a different value? 
When do I actually get to decide? Only when I am sending from my own wallet?

I bought at $7,816 the other day. 
Lesson number 1. Emotions should NEVER make financial decisions. Dollar cost averaging is a really good idea for me. Glad I learned that now. Bought at $5,900 on Sunday.

Scoped out the website. Just want to recognize your attitude towards expression and representation. Good shizz man. Good spirit about the whole situation. Hustle that original man. It will go for some serious BTC. For sure.

nub question... What is a MEW? Type of wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:34:00
I like the term "offered bounty". I assume Coinbase puts the highest paying "offered bounty" on there to cover their asses so that the transactions get hashed sooner than later. Would that be accurate?
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:31:38
I agree, however, (lol) this is a real concern for the BTC environment as a whole. I think it will get worked out. Both speed and cost but to be honest, as a new adopter I was blown away by the fees. I was going to send $5 to my Ledger to learn how to use it and it cost $4.51. So I didn't bother.
The newcomer and the reputation are so important. In order to protect the integrity of the whole thing in the public eye, this stuff will need to righted faster than the adoption. If the space builds and builds and builds and the stories of fees and speed get some coverage again, it will be very different when it's the cover story on Forbes magazine or the WSJ. Bitcoin will survive but the threat of something smarter, faster, cheaper becomes more real everyday these things don't get worked out.
Not to mention the problems this causes in the adoption as a currency for micro-transactions. You all know. Nothing new here. Just thought I would add something to the idea of how this affects the adoption rate of crypto in general.
Personally I think BTC will survive anything. 60%+ market cap is hard to screw up. Ask Uber. But eventually, if these things are ignored (which they aren't) there could be a threat. 75% MC would feel better but 60% is pretty solid.

Please explain (or link) for the new guy. Thanks.
Is this the guy that pushed for SegWit2x at the NY meeting? Who really is invested heavily in a lot of the "voters"?
And what exactly is he saying here? Looks like he is just encouraging the mining community to get more nodes up and running to support the split?
I don't get the "not trust the current exchanges" and "unwilling to move cold storage".
Is he saying the new coin will pump because everybody is scared? Exchanges included? And they should keep creating a paranoid user base?

I think that the more immediate future will prove to make the market even more volatile with these events. The current bottlenecks and speed bumps to adoption I think likely muted the full impact here.
If there was a more reliable point of entry, a broader consumer understanding, faster speeds, lower fees, etc. this pump would had been even greater. Once all that becomes common place and the kinks worked out however, say 5-10 years down the road, these global macro events will have a smaller effect.
Edit: I should note that their Golix exchange could be an amazing point of entry. I have no idea. Just assuming it is on par with the 4 or 5 I have experience with.

Thank you for that explanation and clarification. Makes sense now. 
Of course there is so far to go, and not that there won't be a smart solution, but it seems a better one will be needed if BTC is really going to reach the far edges of society as an actual currency. (Another topic altogether.)
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:23:30
What a trip. Thank you for the feedback. I’m just trying to make the “smartest” decision but I guess there really isn’t one. I’ve learned a lot over the years about being committed but flexible. So I think for now I let it ride. These decisions are not set in stone. I believe in the future right now and today I see the moon in sight. So, for now, I hodl all of it. I made a commitment to readdress my strategy in January anyhow. I hope it continues to feel “safe” and full of upside. To the moon!

Dollar Cost Averaging on schedule. Nice easy catch!
(Let's not talk about $7,813.86)
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:31:29
Coinbase is very clear on their site that they see $0 of this fee.
"Please note that no portion of this fee goes to Coinbase."
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:03:58
Screenshot that too. I did buy last week at $7,816.86. I'm all about that scheduled DCA now. Hopefully Sunday afternoon sees a little dip.

Thank you for the feedback.

So I am new and I had bought some at $7,300. And then when the fork was cancelled, I bought a little bit at $7,813.86 (anybody higher?) during the excitement.
What a great lesson. It forced me to actually write out a plan that eliminates the emotional hype in my head. And will quell some of the dissapointment when stuff crashes. I actually feel it working already as I watch Bitcoin Cash take off. I believe in the long term for BTC and it's fine if I miss out on some "40% time". It won't be the last time or the last coin to take flight. Happens everyday on something. If I was really worried about BTC's longevity, I would reconsider but I'm not. If I do change my mind on that, I can write up a strategy for getting into Cash at that time. No more emotional/fomo decisions. Feels good really.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:03:36
I have been thinking about this and I like the fact that there is incentive of course, but won't fees just continue to climb? Over $12 right now. Doesn't this severely limit the usability of the coin in the long run?
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:03:57
Well that makes more sense. Interesting to think about how this will play out in the coming years.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:37:55
Anybody know how an order happens when there is a slow down? Should I put my order in now? Do I still commit to the bid price right now? Or do I get the bid when it "processes"?
I'm afraid to do a limit order because I am not sure if the transactions that have not caught up yet are pumping or dumping. Anybody know? Is the traffic I see, setting the market price regardless of the slow down?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:31:03
Ok. Mostly makes sense. If you could help get it all the way through I would appreciate it. I'm sure I don't understand part of the way the exchanges actually interact with the two different blockchains at the same time.
The exchange is just acting as a liquidator, right? So even though we are trading one currency for another, they just commit to the transaction and do the actual swaps and initiate the txids for each currencies blockchain. Am I getting this?

What I have learned is that it really is as complicated as it sounds. The exchange between currencies all matter. But essentially if you trade some NEO for some ETH, you have that value in ETH. You may just keep that ETH and ride that volatility as opposed to something else but essentially people tend to consider "taking profit" as converting back to fiat regardless of how you get there. For example, if your $100 worth of NEO gets traded to $100 worth of ETH you can quickly convert back to fiat of $100. But if you keep your ETH for 2 hours or two days or two weeks, you may have less than $100 worth. So you always have your USD value at risk unless you actually convert it to USD. (has its own risks of course). But essentially most people consider taking their crypto profits to mean that they sold their crypto for USD or purchased a physical asset like a car or a house with the crypto. Hope that makes a little more sense. FYI. Every crypto exchange is a taxable event according to current US tax law.

I don’t know much about it but apparently a lot of people use Tether. I believe it is designed to always maintain about the same value.
