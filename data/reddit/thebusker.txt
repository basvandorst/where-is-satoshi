I am in agreement over trust in Bitcoin as a value because it shows a sentiment of trust toward the viability of Bitcoin. But I still believe the wider use of it to purchase goods and services will have a larger effect on the adoption of Bitcoin.

What is your obsession with telling me to create my own coin? I am here standing for the adoption of bitcoin.
I want bitcoin to proliferate. It's just that I feel the way the community is going about it by saving is not the correct course to see widespread adoption. I appreciate you trying to have a meaningful debate with me on the matter. Our views differ and neither wants to concede. Let's just agree on this and call it a day.
I grow weary. I have posted my share of words today trying to talk sense to the fanatics and defend my stance that widespread usage will do a lot more for bitcoin than it's perceived value. Perceived value can change. It can rise or it can fall. Widespread adoption and utility is hard to change and harder to dismiss.

This is not FUD. This is the truth of the matter, can you counter my argument that another coin with wider adoption and significant backing by a large corporation will not wipe out bitcoin?
It will wipe out bitcoin the commodity/investment but it won't wipe out the protocol or network - this has been invented and cannot be un-invented.
Can you also counter that bitcoin's value as it stands right now is not fuelled by speculation?

The addition of 5.2 billion coins per year was also known since day 1. The developers said they were leaving the code as is - not changing it to add the 5.2 billion coins per year.
Edit: And even the logic of it being an inflationary currency doesn't hold water. A lot of economists will tell you that inflation is good for a currency as it promotes the utilization and encourages spending. It's a feature that differentiates Doge from LTC and BTC.

Why did you take those 20 BTC? If they mistakenly put it into your account, and you knew it was a mistake - why did you withdraw them? When you withdrew them, what was the price per BTC? Was it prior to the fall in price during the revelation of the Charlie Shrem arrest?
I wager they charged you for the BTC before the price fall and now that the price has fallen, you don't want to pay the initial higher price, the price at the time when you withdrew them.
If you don't want to pay the higher price, then you shouldn't have withdrawn them.

Then in my opinion you are doing it wrong. You should promote adoption by utility - not by saving.
I am speculating but not for selfish and financial gain. I am speculating that people should promote bitcoin via use and not via saving. There is no agenda on the pricing for me which makes it less of a factor when I share my opinion.

You are explaining the technicalities of bitcoin protocol. It's the same with every new coin. They are all based on the same protocol.
I am arguing, that there will come a coin that is more widely used than bitcoin and will improve upon it in some way. I am not saying that coin exists yet, but that it can exist later.
You can argue that it doesn't seem likely or that bitcoin has a head start and can adapt and that is fine.
But to downright squash the notion that a coin can come along and replace bitcoin shows you are quite stubborn.

Yes, I would be ok with this. I paid you $1000 worth of BTC. I get $1000 back. If it doesn't buy me 1 BTC anymore, that is my problem and shouldn't be yours as a retailer. Say it was a gold bar worth $1000 USD that I chose to exchange. I gave you the gold bar - you converted it into USD and I bought $1000 worth of merchandise, the gold bar has been converted into USD, it's no longer in your possession.

The announcement was to tell the community that the code was going to stay the same. They obviously were thinking of changing it to be deflationary - but decided to leave it as is, hence the announcement.
Investment was never a goal of Dogecoin. It was created to be used like a currency - which I might remind you, is how Bitcoin was intended to be used. The Investment vehicle was created by speculators.
Satoshi's goal was to create a currency that could be sent easily and verified without a central authority. Not an investment vehicle.
Dogecoin will be around as long as people use it. And if you judge it by that metric, it is more widely used than other crypto currency and is growing in adoption at an astounding rate.

1. They add 70bn a month the the money supply already. Why wouldn't they release another $70bn gradually over a year - which is 7 times bitcoin market cap. How does the 70bn they are releasing now per month affect inflation?
2. Why can't they just limit the amount of miners once it hits an acceptable hashrate to conduct transactions in a timely manner?
3. Why is there a need for bitcoin then? The Fed coin uses this same revolutionary protocol. Trust is not lost, but rather it's placed in an authority that uses bitcoin protocol to do everything that bitcoin does - without the speculation. Are you saying that Speculation is the killer app of bitcoin?

Why is a higher price necessary to achieve this goal. A higher price will only indicate that it is growing in adoption.
While I would say that a higher price would make it so that early spenders have lost the potential gain in value. It in no way affects the utility of bitcoin.
Say it started off with a $5 million dollar market cap, and everyone actually used that $5 million dollars to purchase items. 100% spending. And through the usage of that $5m it rose to $10m. Now there are $10m worth of spending.
It just means that $10m has been redistributed into new hands and they have reaped the gains. It redistributed the wealth from the predecessor to the successor. The successor reaped the benefits. First generation passing it's wealth to second generation. Second generation gains the rewards, but that is because they were willing to accept the coin.

I would argue then that lowering of price is better for adoption rather than the rising of price.
Smartphones are now cheaper, adoption is greater. Internet is cheaper, adoption is higher.
But my statement is missing the point. Price doesn't actually have any correlation to adoption with bitcoin as it's utility is actual close to free.

What one liner did I use? I provided many lines of questioning your motives.
Firstly I asked if you held Doge. As you don't - I don't see why you would be invested in the value of something you do not hold.
Second, I looked through your post history, and it shows a lot of posting in r/dogecoin. Once again, why post so much when you don't have anything invested?
Thirdly, you are providing information to holders of Doge. Why? I merely question your motives in regard to a coin you hold no vested interest.

@_date: 2014-02-07 11:17:59
Price rise equals less volatility? How does a price rise equal less volatility. Looking at it percentage wise. If it were valued at $1m a swing of 1 per cent would equal a $10,000 swing. If anything it would make it more volatile. If it were $10 per bitcoin and it has a swing of 1 per cent then it would only mean a swing of 10c. Price has nothing to do with volatility.
Higher price also doesn't equal adoption via retailers. Retailers don't hold bitcoin as an investment. They convert to fiat straight away.
Did you even read my statements. Price has nothing to do with adoption or usage.
@_date: 2014-02-05 23:03:11
You will understand once Bitcoin is replaced. The price has nothing to do with it. The only reason why it's not replaced at the moment is because it is still unclear where Cryto Currencies will lead us. Once it's clear that the network and protocol are the key factors, a new coin will come along and wipe bitcoin out.
The best way bitcoin can stop this is not by increasing it's price but by making the install base and user base larger by promotion of use to gain this adoption. Which is my argument all along. I am not promoting the downfall of bitcoin here. I am promoting its rise by utilizing it.
You can continue to hoard it and try to promote it via increase in value. Value of the coin is only here at the moment due to speculators. Once they leave, you will understand.
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:01:16
By the mechanism that bitcoin is actually an open source and free to use application and protocol. 
And you keep saying holding. That is not the intended use of bitcoin.
The intended use was to create a currency that could be sent easily which could be trusted via consensus of the network at relatively no cost. Which bitcoin has done.
It was never intended to be held as an investment. This was created by speculators - which is what you are. You are a speculator, as you hold your coins hoping they will grow in value, speculating that the price will rise.
And your argument that there can be no currency if people don't hold it is based on your opinion. Currencies are created to be able to circulate, store of value is another use, but the main use is circulation - so that people can use it to trade for other items. Saving and price rise doesn't promote the adoption of a currency. It may promote it to investors and speculators but not users.
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:44:13

The price of bitcoin has no correlation to Merchants incentive to accept it - they convert it to fiat on the spot. Most businesses accepting bitcoin do not hold any bitcoins.
The wider use of bitcoin however creates great incentive for Merchants to accept it.

Bitcoin is an open source protocol. It can and will be replaced by something that gains wider utility.
My sentiment is that the greed of hoarders who don't actively use their coins will contribute largely to this downfall by not practicing in its use and adoption.

No, I can disagree with you without saying bad things about you - which I can honestly say is very trying for me at the moment.
But this thread is an obvious post to try and incite FUD about dogecoin - just look at the title. It says the devs fucked all the initial investors by removing the cap - which is also false and misleading as there never was a cap, or investors for that matter.
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:45:25
There is no need to save dogecoin - it is performing better than any other cryto currency. It has a vibrant community, it has good morals and ideals, it's welcoming to new adopters and it's growing faster than bitcoin in terms of utility.
bitcoin on the other hand is full of greedy speculators who feel as though they are entitled to more profits just because they hoard the coin, spread a little good news every now and then and smash an iPhone, or 5.

Let's not forget who created the smartphone as we know it today. Who created the iTunes store business model, the appstore business model?
Now that they won't allow just anyone or anything to reap the rewards of their hard work you call anti-trust. You can't call anti-trust on something that they created and own. Your philosophical base is baseless.
They did the hard work, similar to what you are trying to do with bitcoin now. They took the gamble, they invested the resources and now you feel as though they owe you something? This is what I have been saying all along. The greed of this community knows no bounds.
It thinks they deserve something for supporting this cause - well let me tell you, this little cause has paid you back more than enough.
You want to reach mass adoption and proliferation by just holding and hoarding your little coins and telling people to buy them? You want access to Apple's user base? They don't owe you a thing. You owe them for starting the Personal Computer Revolution. You owe them from creating smartphones for creating tablets. Stop thinking you are entitled to anything. And you owe bitcoin. Bitcoin owes you nothing. Apple owes you nothing.

And how you can say I am the one who is bullying boggles me. I am the minority voice here. Bullying by definition states that the bully is bullying someone of smaller stature or populace.
There can be a small justification that Apple is bullying you by not letting you have an app on the app store, but they are not bullying. They are making a decision not to follow bitcoin - maybe they have other ideas. The community is in a state of mind that Apple has declared War on bitcoin. They didn't declare War, they merely didn't accept your idea.

Where did the 20 BTC go then? If they were still in his account I don't think Coinbase would have charged him for them.
The point is, they were in his account, he decided to take them and Coinbase charged him for them.
Now that he has taken them and they aren't worth the same amount as what he was charged, he wants to say:
"No I don't want them at that price you charged me. I want to give you the BTC back."
He should have left them where they were. I bet he wouldn't be complaining if the BTC he was charged for had risen in price.

Stay alive? I already stated Doge is the most *alive* coin out there. It's the most widely used crypto out there. Like culture, it will stay alive as long as there are people using it. And Dogecoin is based on the same source as litecoin and bitcoin. Attacking it via development is the same as attacking bitcoin.
Battlecoin is based on attacking coins by utilizing their *vast computer resources* to mine the coin it is attacking - their vast computer resources is currently non-existent.
So basically any coin that has a low hashrate will be succeptable to this attack. Dogecoin's net hashrate is the second largest compared to bitcoin. Why would you say Doge will be killed first? Litecoin has a larger probability of falling to BattleCoin as their hashrate is lower.

I do not presume motive of selfish gain. This is a well known motive as to why there are so many speculators here. This is the fact of the matter.
The value needs to be there, yes, but the value shouldn't be the driving factor in adoption of bitcoin. Adoption itself should be the driving factor of bitcoin - once again, I must tell you, adoption by definition implies utility. Increase in price does not imply there will be greater adoption, adoption however can lead to an increase in price.

The speculators that are currently in bitcoin are fanatical, greedy hoarders. I will not refrain from saying this. It's the truth.
I will support Bitcoin no matter which form it is in. Currently I support dogecoin the most as it's ideology, community and intentions are the closest resemblance to what I deem is the ideal of Bitcoin - what it's creator intended it to be.

Bitcoin at its current state is far from pure. It is being driven by speculators as an investment vehicle. It will only become this pure entity when people stop worrying about the price and just use it as it was intended.

This is a reasonable course of action. Although it is not actually financially prudent. It is a good show of support for bitcoin, but Apple's business doesn't rely on and is in no way linked to the success of bitcoin. If bitcoin succeeds Apple can reverse their stance.

Number of transactions is indeed promising by looking at the graph, but are these trades or actual purchases of items?
Putting into account the $126,000 from Overstock and the $500,000 from Tiger Direct and the Black Friday Sales of $7m and the ~$1m of precious metal sales, that totals: ~$9m. Which is about 1% of total Market Cap, which would mean 99% are hoarding bitcoins.

You state the halving of the coins rewards per block found won't do anything to the price. And yet you state that the allowing of adding more coins will do something. You also state Investors/Speculators don't like Inflation, so they must like Deflation right? Halving is by essence deflation.
You contradict yourself.

I share the same concerns as you on this matter. It worries me that the address in my Coinjar wallet is not actually *my* address, but rather Coinjar's address and is controlled totally by Coinjar. My Bitcoin is basically at their disposal - similar to my money at the bank. When you deposit any Bitcoin into Coinjar that Bitcoin no longer belongs to you. it is now Coinjar's and they will put a number in their system to indicate that you have that sum of Bitcoin in their holding.
But I have been told that all web wallets act like this in nature, and being early days in the Bitcoin market in Australia, we don't seem to have any other choice.
TLDR; When you deposit Bitcoin into Coinjar, the coins are no longer yours. But that you *trust* Coinjar to honour the release of the Bitcoins in their system back to you or another third party. But in their defense they have been very accommodating and show no signs of ill intent. We shouldn't go on a witch hunt until there are actually witches.

It does not distract from the real bitcoin community. Bitcoin was created to be used. I would argue that the bitcoin community with its large amount of speculators and savers distracts from the original idea of bitcoin:

It doesn't work now that there are speculators. Having a fixed value also doesn't work as there is no room for growth other than introduction of new coins - which will end.
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:56:12
Am I arguing that there isn't a way that anyone can actually *take a shot* and help fix this problem? No. I am arguing that the people who had the title of Bitcoin Development Team - which leaves little to interpretation that they are the actual development team behind bitcoin by consensus of the community - did not address a quirk that had been in existence for three years.
Why are you asking me to become a bitcoin developer? It has little correlation to what I implied.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:27:49

Then the events of the past few days have opened their eyes, that this is indeed a big issue - as it has completely halted withdrawals from most major exchanges.
Then they were incompetent in not identifying that the issue is a larger problem than they imagined.
@_date: 2014-02-07 16:40:47
So then the new coins that aim to replace bitcoin run choppy as hell and are very slow? Your argument has no correlation to my argument that bitcoins replacement will be based on a higher user base - not the technology. As all new coins are based on bitcoin protocol with added features/tweaks.
I would also argue further technological understanding and evolution of bitcoin by the successor can make bitcoin look choppy and slow as hell.
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:55:27
I am not badmouthing it. I am bringing up thoughts I have regarding the saving of Bitcoin. I defended Dogecoin only from people who blatantly tried to make FUD about it.
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:39:17
The new coin has 100 times the amount of wallets. The new coin has a 100 times the user base of bitcoin and is far more likely to spend those coins rather than holding onto them.
Is this a good enough example?
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:57:55
I can see how this helps the people who had large holdings in BTC and increases their buying power - but not the adoption. I also bring up the notion of hypocrisy as stated in the title. Bitcoin is preaching that fiat is not worth anything as it has unlimited supply, but everyone who is saving BTC is waiting to cash out late in fiat right?
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:30:24
Bitcoin protocol will prevail no matter what. bitcoins, however have a large likelihood of being replaced by a better/faster coin with a larger user base.
Bitcoin protocol will evolve into a way of agreeing on consensus of ownership and not some commodity as it is known today.
The first version of something revolutionary hardly ever becomes the version that gains mass adoption.
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:42:04
Yes, I could do that, except, I am not on the development team am I? I also don't get paid to develop it.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:40:10
It's their appstore. They never said it was open-source. They are a closed System. If you don't like it then don't develop for them. You don't go and say that they declared a WAR on you and that you are now fighting a war.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:55:49
I am only defending them from a neutral standpoint. They didn't accept your idea and you retaliated with a so-called war.
And it does make them childish and fanatical, breaking things when you don't get your way is by definition and metaphorically linked to childish behavior.
Fanatical in the sense that you have an idea, and you are using extremism to try and convey that message.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:31:18
Firstly why do you single out Doge? There are hundreds of coins out there, yet you single out Doge.
You don't single out CatCoin or BitBar or any of the far smaller coins out there - which would be logical as those lesser known and obscure coins are what BattleCoin is trying to *kill*.
Doge, by utility is the most used and transacted coin out there. I am not talking about value based transactions. I am talking about pure number of transactions and people actually using it.
In 2 months, it has gone from a new currency to a top 5 currency. In 2 months it has reached over 50,000 subscribers in the subreddit. Let's just think about that for a second. Two months.
Granted, Bitcoin didn't have Bitcoin to help it, but you can't ignore how much dogecoin has done in the short amount of time it has been in existence. And it's fine for a bigger brother to feel insecure over the success of a younger sibling. But don't diminish the achievements, it makes you appear jealous.
First they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they fight you. Then you win.
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:23:05
Fees would actually be lower than bitcoins based on bitcoins current valuation. I stated that everything would remain the same. The protocol, the fee structure. The only thing that would be different is the speculation.
The same people who are mining now would mine. The details of how much a reward for mining isn't important - maybe they could even have contracts for mining. You provide a certain amount of hashes for a certain amount per month.
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:24:08
Yes. This has been my stance all along. Blocking bitcoin apps on their platform, which they created, is not an attempt to sabotage bitcoin. Bitcoin has many avenues to proliferate.
You wanting access to the iOS market share to proliferate bitcoin is understandable. It's a very large install base.
Stop begging Apple to let you have access to their install base, create a larger install base than apple. Make them beg you for your install base.
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:46:46
I can make it this statement with relatively good accuracy:
Over 90% of Bitcoin holders are holding onto it as an investment. Most transactions we see are trading over exchanges and not the use of Bitcoin to by products or services. What am I ratting here? I am pointing out arguments that can be made that are stifling Bitcoins adoption.
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:50:51
We are going around in circles. This is my last statement on the matter. Price should not be the driving factor in adoption of bitcoin - fast, easy and cheap utility should be the driving factor of bitcoin. Adoption will lead to increase in price via mass utility, not through speculation.
@_date: 2014-02-05 19:54:05
What good is $1m per bitcoin if no one uses them? Utility is what Bitcoin is about.
In my opinion all the early miners and adopters who received bitcoins at below $100 USD per bitcoin and aren't utilizing them to put money into the economy is just plain greedy. There is no other word for it.
You want to start a revolution, but aren't willing to sacrifice further personal financial gain - this is my fundamental problem with Bitcoin. Selfish personal gain over the widespread adoption and economic stimulus.
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:35:12
If it's Gox's fault then why do we see all major exchanges halting the withdrawal of bitcoins?
It may be a DDOS attack happening at the moment, but that doesn't deter from the fact that there is an angle to be attacked now does it?

You are helping Bitcoin gain wider adoption and kudos to you. That doesn't change what I stated though.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:52:57


Wow. All you need to do is dress up in a dark hooded cloak and hold up some kind of effigy and it will be complete.
@_date: 2014-01-17 22:36:43
Supply and Demand. It's the only reason at this stage of bitcoins life, 90% of all bitcoin holders are speculators. In the world of speculation: Supply &gt; Demand = Lower Price.
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:19:33
When have I stated that it does? If bitcoin were worth $10 it doesn't change its core features or its utility in any way. It only changes well, the price.
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:55:51

@_date: 2014-02-06 16:48:40
Oh, you would get a lot more attention if you went out and started shooting people who use iPhones. You would get unlimited bad press with that publicity stunt.
The idea is not to draw a line on how far you should go for a publicity stunt. The idea is to not even walk down that road - which has been my argument all along.
Bitcoin has many avenues open to it to gain widespread adoption. Instead of feeling hurt over Apple not allowing their install base to use bitcoin - why not create an install base larger than Apple and make them beg you for your market share.
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:30:46
I insult no one. I only single out their actions. Bitcoin *is* full of greedy speculators. 90% of people who hold bitcoin do so as a speculative investment.
The Dogecoin community isn't complaining that we can't have access to the iOS market. We make do with other wallet apps. Bitcoin however complains like a petulant child and breaks iPhones over it. And yet we still grow in usage and adoption. We actually just raised 330 BTC worth for a charity.
But you should just keep ignoring and laughing at us.
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:24:15
Doesn't justify destroying a perfectly good phone so that you can perpetuate a childish battle with Apple, *dude*.
It's the wrong approach. Apple has shown their stance on the bitcoin idea. They chose not to accept it. Respect and accept their decision like an adult would respect the decision of someone who doesn't want to have sex with you.
Don't try and force yourself on them, and don't break things like a child.
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:38:00
So they addressed the issue in a day? So why did it take three years?
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:43:53
While a larger market cap does equal more opportunity for trade it has nothing to do with the profitability. Profit happens when you sell something for a higher price.
A rise in the value of bitcoin would only mean more buying power if you had held on to it.
Profit comes from selling a good or service at a marginally higher price than you obtained it. The price of the medium you are using to facilitate the sale doesn't have anything to do with profit.
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:19:49
Honestly, why do you bother posting? Wake up from what? Should we all dump our BTC holdings? I really don't understand your objective here. Now get buried and piss off.

What I meant to say was, they aren't DDOSing their servers, they are DDOSing huge transactional volume at them using this quirk in the hopes that they can mis-align their balance keeping records.
If the quirk didn't exist and was addressed, the DDOS would be rendered ineffective.
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:49:42
It's true though. lol

Yes, another transaction that I made also went through very quickly. That's why I am a little worried about this transaction - If they would just tell me what's going on I would feel a lot more secure about this, but I have heard nothing from them for 3 days. The person who was administering my support ticket has also made new posts since this time, yet has not replied my support ticket.
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:07:56


This in my opinion is a bug. It was never intended to be a speculative investment vehicle. It was intended to be a widely used and stable currency. That could be agreed upon with network consensus on ownership.


Your ideology of bitcoin is clouding your logic here. You truly believe the FED can't fund or pay to have miners on the same magnitude of current bitcoin miners?
@_date: 2014-02-14 18:19:42
People are greedy. They also become delusional and fanatical when they have large amounts of money invested into something.
Even when presented with logically correct information that puts their investment in a bad light, they will choose to ignore it.
Price is rising - Good News! Bitcoin is becoming accepted and adopted.
Price is falling - Also Good News! Time to buy more!

I laughed harder than I imagined I would.
@_date: 2014-01-06 15:11:42
I understand how you feel regarding this. But like I said, we are still very early in Bitcoin's development. This is the current solution that is on offer, I believe it will evolve and be rectified as time moves forward and as demand for not only Bitcoin, but the ideals that every Bitcoiner holds dear grows. We are the pioneers/early adopters and have to build the railroad tracks and foundations. We are still using a mix of old technology(banking in the archaic sense) and new technology. I am sure it will evolve over time to shed the archaic factors though.
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:34:26


Yes and you can display your outrage in a calm and reasonable manner. Accusing them of declaring war on bitcoin is not calm and reasonable.
Getting people to break their iPhones in retaliation is also not calm and reasonable.
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:27:02
Testimony that isn't as bad as you say, is that your post has not been buried.
On another matter though, if the price of bitcoin can be affected by reddit, then bitcoin isn't ready yet - which it isn't. It's beginning it's journey, but everyone can agree it's not ready for prime time yet. It will be in the next few years, but not as a commodity or currency in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:00:04


This is exactly what I am saying. It's not the monetary value.


Personal attacks? Really?
@_date: 2014-01-04 12:03:54
Calm down, no one is stealing your coins, masking them just means adding a filter. You can always see how many BTC you have. It's just for ease of use/reading. It's useless replying to you actually, you are so blinded by your outrage that trying to debate you is useless.
@_date: 2014-02-05 21:21:12


And this isn't presumptuous?
$126,000 from Overstock and $500,000 from Tiger Direct and the Black Friday Sales of $7m and the ~$1m of precious metal sales, that totals: ~$9m. Which is about 0.1% of total Market Cap, which would mean 99% are hoarding bitcoins.
I stated 0.2% which would double the amounts I just stated - and is still only 1/5 of 1 percent of market cap. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 03:33:06
This current iteration of Bitcoin will die. Bitcoin as a commodity will be milked for all its worth by the greedy and powerful. If and when it re-emerges, it will be what Satoshi hoped it would be, at least a closer semblance of what Satoshi hoped it would be.

I have had a very positive experience with Coinjar.
Opened account around mid-December, 2013. Linked my bank account, which took about 2 days to verify.
Submitted my Identification for verification on the 23rd and had it verified on the 27th, by the Founder, Ryan Zhou. He personally sent me the confirmation it was verified.
Sent 0.5 BTC from my BTCe account on the 29th. Withdrew my first 0.5 BTC on the 30th after creating a sell order with Filler(which took about 2 days to process). I got $409 AUD for the sale.
My opinion is they are a relatively small startup and are going through growing pains. But they are definitely trying their best to cope with the demand for Bitcoin. They are a legitimate company and have a good banking relationship with NAB and Westpac.
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:08:49

That's the thing - I can't as the community spends it with great pride to promote it's adoption. Most dogecoin owners are just happy they have even come this far. They are grateful for what bitcoin has bestowed upon them.
You however are never grateful, always wanting more. Higher price. I can profit more if I just hoard this coin a little longer.

You seem to be quite good at editing videos. I only wished you used that skill for a better message than wasting perfectly good iPhones.

Good work nonetheless. Well done.
@_date: 2014-01-03 14:02:27
Exactly, presenting it in that format even you got confused. If it were presented in local currency, I doubt you will ever be confused. The technology and calculation of Bitcoin needs to be invisible to the end user and presented in a way that they understand.
I believe this usability factor will allow it to become mainstream and gain widespread adoption.

Your approach is childish and resentful. Your approach should be:
Hey Apple, we've created this little thing that has risen in popularity - perhaps you should take a look at it.
It's cool if you don't think it will be a thing and you may have other ideas and I respect that. But in case you are interested we are always going to be here.

Apple has always been about control. Steve Jobs said:
"People who are serious about software should make their own hardware."
Apple has always been about creating a closed system so they can dictate the user experience - and you only realize this now.
Says fuck you Apple, you lost a customer. Frankly you're not a customer that Apple even wants or needs. You and your Bitcoin's $10 Billion market cap can frankly eat shit in Apple's eyes. Apple has over a $100 Billion in cash - it can buy all of your Bitcoin 10 times over and not even break a sweat.

From what I read in that thread, he cooperated fully and maintains that someone hacked his accounts via one of his email addresses.
It does come as very surprising to me that such an incident occurred.
He could have orchestrated the hack as he is the co-founder of Coinjar which seems like a competitor to Bitcoinica, using it as testing grounds for a website security experiment.
But I believe that the Coinjar is a legitimate company and my experience has still been very positive nonetheless.

When you post something on reddit, there is an upvote button next to your post. Does this imply you are begging for upvotes? Though the upvote button is a function of the site and not by your choice, it is still there nonetheless. It is there as a means for people to utilize if they so desire to give you an upvote. It will take more than a few downvotes from people to change my rationale on this matter. I won't be seeing myself anywhere.

Ah, but I already stated that people will spend regardless of perceived gain in currency over time. Because their desire for the item is greater than the gain in holding their currency - or as in my example, waiting for a better item at the same price 6 months later. I feel that People will still spend, irregardless.

I would disagree. Their fiat has value, they can purchase gold with that fiat right now and then watch it appreciate, but they won't because they perceive gold that sits there in storage as useless to them, even though it will appreciate. They would choose to spend their fiat on an iPhone or iPad, because they use it on a daily basis and it enriches their lives.
People who own gold, I would also think are not regular consumers. Like I said, I believe Bitcoin can teach these consumers, that a currency is like gold - it should appreciate. But you can only teach someone who is willing to be taught.

I don't see a problem, I see a difference in opinion. Some people couldn't imagine standing in front of hundreds of people and placing a means of collecting donations in front of themselves. While others are perfectly fine with it and even enjoy it.
I never asked anybody to donate anything. I offered a means of doing so, if they were inclined. The donation is not the motivation for what I wrote. I would have shared my thoughts no matter what, just like I would still perform in front of hundreds of people with no reward. The reward is a bonus, not a motivator. That's why I have no problem with it.
