I just started hobby mining LTC in March 2014.  I have zero BTC at the moment, but plan on starting to buy every month via Coinbase.  I've been in IT since I was roughly 13-14 years old doing dial-up bulletin board systems with my brother (BBS's).  I find this new technology fascinating and I believe that BTC will be used for more commercial applications over time.   I think LTC will catch on as basically the quicker transactions as you list in your initial post.  I think BTC will be used for more contractual agreements as well, with escrow services and the like.  Not that LTC cannot do the same as the architecture is very closely structure, but I think BTC will eventually be much higher in value per other fiat currencies that utilizing it for smaller transactions will be harder and harder.  LTC will increase as well but more on the level that BTC is now staying in the $500USD range once it matures in the next 5 years.
The thing I don't think people realize is that this technology really is going to balance out how everything is done globally.  We won't be tied to governments anywhere near as much.  It's akin to Mouth in the Goonies diving back in the wishing well to grab as many coins as he can get.
We're taking it back.... we're taking it all back.
