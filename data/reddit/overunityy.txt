Well said ,I support The Peoples currency .

Fiat is backed only by a promisory note and relies entirely on the peoples trust of their governing body .
Hands up how many actually trust anything the government says .
This is  to show that not a lot of average joes trust government, that then shows that the entity that backs fiat is very weak in reality .
Bitcoin in turn is backed by every single user of the currency ,which as it grows could be average joe ,bitcoin price will reflect  the mass populace that believe in its value which in turn will be seen it its true price discovery .
Fiat's price is tightly controlled by central banks manipulation in the markets ,it is not a reflection of true market price.
 We all know any fiat can be infinitely put in to circulation to weaken its value thus actually taking money directly out of the wallets of it's  population without the masses even noticing ,This is were bitcoin is given value since it has a fixed mathematical algorithm controlling the amount in circulation .
Gold until 1971 controlled fiat but now bankers are forcing poverty on the masses through pouring trillions of extra fiat currency into circulation thus weakening spending power.
Bitcoin if the population accepts it corrects these current fiat flaws

The item you sell is always valued in your currency ,so if they pay $1000 for an item you should return them  $1000 or the equivilant in btc ,there really is no issue .
Bitcoin is global but local items will be the local currency converted to bitcoin amount .

This is the first time in history that the average person in the street has the opportunity to buy or invest in something that has a potential to gain in value ,can anyone name anything that a working man can buy that does this ?
Generally anything that has potential is ringfenced by large financial companies who create barriers such as Fidelity and there minimum £2,000,000 net wealth and £200,000 income levels.
Bitcoin is a peoples currency and for the first time in history anyone can buy a small amount relative to their income and take part in something that even has potential to gain value .
For the first time in history you have a weapon to show banks that you do not agree with the way they are treating customers and the way the bailouts were handled .
Every £1 you save in bitcoin is taking ~£16 of lending power from the banking system due to the fractional reserve system ,so if you want to send government and financial instituttions a message save in bitcoin .Do your part and collectively a message will be heard .
If people adopt bitcoin, infrastructure will be built and its usability to buy everyday items will happen .
Once £10,000 /bitcoin is reached most people will know of at least one place locally they can spend it and early adopter who saved with bitcoin could be spending purely the profits.

What I will tell you is that bitcoin trading so far is far more honest and easy for a new trader .
With bitcoin you only lose money by selling lower than you bought , as long as you hold the value of your coins goes up and down but you are always in the game .
Now compare this to Forex ,most traders are on 150-1 or more leverage, so that relatively small moves give them a margin call and the whole account is gone forever .
At present in bitcoin this does not exist that I'am aware of .
In forex and stocks you do not get the order book or real volume in some cases no time and sales .
These are vital components to evaluate trades so make full use of these tools as I suspect once wall street get their grubby hands into bitcoin trading platforms will appear with 150-1 + leverage and people will be tempted with the lure of bigger profits but take it from me 95% lose their account inside 6 months .
Stick with bitcoin and 1-1 leverage and at all costs resist the  soon to come promises of highly leveraged accounts , where you will lose all your coins and any money you had in the account .

Do you really have faith in your government ,be honest ,you are forced to trust them by law ,can you really say hand on heart you believe what the government tell you ?
bitcoin allows you to show your faith in it by voluntarily holding it ,you are currently forced to hold government currency .

I do not think the developers will make it public what the top ten issues are .
My biggest concern is with the bitcoin developers not getting paid for there work ,as far as i can tell one person gets a wage and all other contributors do it for free.
We all need to make a living and developers are no different so the main flaw for me is that the malleability issue would have been solved in 2011 if more developers had a financial reward for their labors just like anyone else .
I fear for the longevity of bitcoin because I see no wage structure for developers to quickly resolve issues such as we have seen recently
