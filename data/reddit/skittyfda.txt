Unrelated but I was wondering if you have a source you'd be willing to share for smaller quantities of individual flavor molecules.

What scraping tool do you use and where do you scrape from?

TPA was the first place I checked and I even wrote them an email with no response. How do you suspect companies like Flavorah and Real Flavors get their start given these limitations?

Cool cool. Hope to meet you one day. We're friends on FB and I've been checking your site every once in a while for the rumored travel calendar but one thing I've learned from reading your shit is you're shit at staying on schedule. Hard to find ladders like the ones you leave on the open internet so I put up with it with a smile on my face. Truly appreciate all of your contributions and I hope to follow in your footsteps with age!
Edit: **BEST** - Fucking lol

I'll be glad to keep checking and happy to hear you'll be near. Oddly enough, I had a dream once that I had lunch with you in a dim-lit diner with gothic architecture. Very excited to hear some of your stories and talk real estate/aroma compounds.

I'm in NE Ohio and have a couple humble properties I rehabbed but am looking to expand but of course cut costs wherever I can. I'm just wondering what you're googling to find these local pay-to-play sites.
