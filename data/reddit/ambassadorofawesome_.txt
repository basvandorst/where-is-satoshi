I would humbly suggest 50% liquidate. Then decide on a good monthly “leak”. Say $500 a coin Times 20 coins, and then determine to sell that value each month treating your balance like an annuity. I don’t think you could sell more than it would increase per coin. 
The other 20 coins cold storage and be a difference maker in your family’s history.

Is he forgetting to mention the addition of a new coin with the fork of bitcoin cash? Of course that had an effect on percentage of cap. Maybe some valid points regarding fees but don't take mutually exclusive occurrences and tie them together to support arguments.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:57:24
It would be worth it to raise your purchase value if your goal is to purchase a whole coin in the end. The btc would only need to increase in value 3% weekly to surpass your $100 value now and that minimum percent will decrease as value increases. As points made above suggest, your purchase strategy makes sense if you want to participate in the growth pattern.
Do the math on a couple of examples with different growth. Regardless of your goal(buying a coin or investing in growth) buying more consistently makes financial sense if you can afford.

I borrowed against my 401k with a personal loan. When they asked why I said “investing in a business”. Bought at $4900 and needed btc to be only double in value in 20 years to make math sense. I’m happy with the progress so far obviously. Payroll deductions for the repayment is my mental dollar cost average with a HUGE discount since every two weeks I’m buying at $4900.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:39:29
You can not retrieve like that. It’s my understanding it comes out as a percentage of the total. The increase in value is tied to the value of the object. For simple math...if she bought in 2 bitcoin at $2500 each, and she would be selling .5 bitcoin at $10k each to withdraw $5usd, then she would pay cap gains on $3750usd with $1250 being her initial investment on the half coin.

Here’s my best ELI5. You buy a framed piece of art. For years you hang that beautiful thing on your wall. One day, your girlfriend comes along and wants to reframe the art. She takes it off the wall and pulls it out the frame. lol and behold, there’s another piece of art behind yours. Now you own two beautiful arts. Your girlfriend frames both pieces separate for you to now own and enjoy on your wall. 
Your girlfriend is Coinbase. Your bitcoin is the art, and segwit2x is the extra art you’ve discovered.
Your girlfriend gave you access and enjoyment of your second piece but ISN’T the one that gave it to you. She merely helped you see it and display it. Both pieces came from the same source and she’s making the splitting of the two easier.
Coinbase isn’t doing this to be nice. They’re hopin the early access to coins will produce more transaction fees for them. Just as you trusted your girlfriend to handle your valuable art the way you want, you’re trusting Coinbase to manage and split your coins.

If I remember what I did when I accidentally sent to a btc wallet instead of a bch wallet address like you did rather than blame someone else, I deleted the bch wallet on the app, then used the same seed to start a new one, which scanned the addresses pulling my bch into it. Pretty sure I fixed my own problem looking at their FAQ or google searched for the help.
The value is in the quantity of bch you own which is effective from the date of your transaction. No one is trying to cheat you. I am choosing to leave the bitcoin.com wallet but not because it’s inoperable or malicious.

It’s an interesting thought. I DO think you’ll have to pay gains only, but from zero cost basis as you took ownership of the property(coin) with no expenditure. Then upon sale, you’ll pay gains on the alt coin full value. Be sure to document dates of forks so you can track your fifo.
I think gift would be a near impossible qualification. Establishing the cost basis at time of ownership would be the difficulty. And there’s no “donor” to verify FMV. “Maybe” you can establish fmv with documentation of the trading value when First present on an exchange, but it’s still tough to call it a gift.

I think that $50 would be better spent learning how to move around on different mediums. Move from coinbase to gdax, do an exchange for another coin...then exchange back to btc. Move that to a couple wallets and create a paper wallet and move it to that. The more practice you'll get the better. When you get better at that, you'll have an appreciation for the coin and be able to ascertain the right answer to your original question.
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:19:19
There you go. That's what I meant, the quantity of btc. No matter what the market does, once you bought the two, it would stay "only two". You should invest only what you're willing or able to lose. Additionally investing it all will make you slightly less liquid and less able to use that money in case of an emergency. If you were my child, the parental advice would be to split your amount into 5 portions and only invest 4 of those...1 a month for 4 months. After the first portion is converted, move it and spend it and store it. Once you realize how boring it is to actually have some, you'll be more prepared to choose to invest more next month.

I was thinking like the replier who talks about bitcoin having more value than the fiat...but I was going to spend the fiat ANYWAYS...I lose NO VALUE if I spend the bitcoin instead of fiat...then support the tech and just refill my wallet with the same quantity of btc spending my fiat on the btc rather than the purchased item.

I did this very same thing but I did all my research first. Have him look at and understand an investment calculator. Since he extracted from a 401k he probably has a loan with a 5 year repayment and percentage of 5% or whatever terms he agreed to. I spent some time doing the same and in 20 years I need btc to double to break even. This takes into effect the LOST retirement money of leaving 10k in the plan for 20 years. 
   10k in a 8% return for 20 years = $46.6k
   11.13k in a 8% return for 15 years = $35.3
      (This a little off as repayments at the beginning will benefit from the plan interest longer)
 Difference of $11,300 PLUS $10,000 purchase is what I need my total to be for break even in 20 years. I think there's some advantage to thinking about my $210 a month payment and wrapping my head around a weird cost averaging process, but I'm still pondering that. 
So basically...I need coin value to double between purchase date and 20 years from now. To the moon...

I've pondered this. I work as a consultant/vendor in the industry. Been talking about it specifically to one customer. I think somehow getting the bitcoin off the books as fast as possible will make your bookkeeper happy. Are you LLC? Perhaps you can use the bitcoin to pay yourself or the wife? 
I think it'll be a while before a POS will include bitcoin as an option, but your current system may be able to set up another pay option similar to a gift card that may include a tip line. Which is another discussion altogether when to auth the transaction pre or post tip. Then use the tablet as a depository wallet.

Agreed that cost of transaction needs to be considered. As does ATM fees, using your cc/debit card at gas pumps versus cash price, interest on cc, higher prices as retailers pay for the "right" to accept cc transactions.
