I haven't been convinced by any such arguments. 
While it's possible for bitcoin to overshoot its equilibrium value (supply vs. demand), over time the decreased production new bitcoins will cause decreased supply.  Since the total amount of the currency is fixed, in the far future the bitcoin price could be fixed very high.
It's like the Berkshire Hathaway of currencies

I guess people are forgetting that if you feel like gambling, it's definitely possible to solo mine and simply hope that you find a block! 
Your chances of "winning" won't start out great, and will likely decrease every 2 weeks, however they will never be truly zero.

You may have to see a tax specialist for more specifics.  But if I remember correctly you're only taxed when cash out bitcoin into USD

If you're looking for more warning signs in an upcoming crash, please know that there really is no way to predict what the price will be with absolute certainty. 
That being said, there was certainly a kind of mass-psychology in effect at the time.  The price seemed over-inflated at the time.  People who had bought bitcoins in the 10-20 range a mere weeks before now saw their investments grow more than 19-fold.  That's not normal, that's astonishing.  The January-April price rise made many rich.  
This, coupled with the uncertainty caused by the largest exchange at the time (MtGox) experiencing huge lag issues really sent the markets into panic sells.  
The market would be running up up up, and then the lag would grow, it would take an hour or so just to get a trade order to go through, and everyone took this as a cue to sell off.  That big drop from $260 was a doozy as everyone's psychology was on the same page at the same time.  Born of this however, was the opportunity to get bitcoin at extremely cheap prices and I don't regret anything I bought sub-100.  
Just be greedy when other people are fearful, and fearful when everyone else is being greedy.

I wouldn't recommend doing this.  If someone is willing to give you cash in exchange for bitoin, they can later go to paypal and claim that you tried to defraud them, and for whatever reason they give paypal will freeze your USD funds and/or take them back. 
If you need to sell them quick, try Coinbase.  If you need to sell them VERY quick, try localbitcoins.

Don't just start an online store, create a google chrome extension that will allow the user to pay you in BTC, and then the item gets purchased and sent to them!

That can actually be problematic.  Sometimes sending repeated responses every day can cause your email to appear newer than it should be, which means they're probably solving other older problems first.  By the time they got to you it was probably way too late to reverse

Well, what do you want to use bitcoins for?  
Personally I feel more comfortable holding bitcoin because it's a hedge against inflation.  Try Coinbase if you live in the U.S. 
@_date: 2013-10-08 22:08:22
It should be.  They have long since lost my business. Currently the only way to get USD funds out is with an emergency withdrawal that takes 2-4 weeks and has a 5% fee.
I hear that other currencies are much faster, but I'm still wondering why there isn't more arbitrage going on.  Theoretically we should see other exchanges slowly increasing and MtGox slowly decreasing

This amount would represent 
* 2.4% of the total amount of bitcoins that can ever exist
* 4.3 % of the current market cap of the bitcoin economy
* The cumulative reward of finding ten thousand 1st era blocks
* Over $100,000,000 USD in today's markets
* About 75,000 ounces, or 2.13 Metric tonnes of gold.  
It's still kind of crazy to think that a mere 1/1000th of a bitcoin is worth almost as much as a US quarter now, but yet here we are!
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:51:24
Ah yeah, I hear you there.  This is really an issue when your account is brand new.  Once you increase your trust limits with them (level 2), you'll get to a point where you can buy bitcoin and they'll give it to you immediately. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 17:45:29
Walls are important pivot points where the market has to collectively decide whether it can overcome the barrier.  Usually it can, but a price point is only as strong as it's given support.  
* If people notice the wall starting to crumble, then it's usually in their best interest to buy into it because the price may not be that low again.  
* If the market decides it can't meet the wall and support is thin underneath, there may be a sell-off as people don't expect the price to go higher.
* If support is substantial AND the wall remains high, then the price simply stagnates in the valley until some breakout activity happens later.

This has already happened.  Numerous alt chains have been started with alternative cryptocurrencies.  They have various niche uses, some better than others, but none have experienced a meteoric rise quite like bitcoin. 
This is simply due to the fact that bitcoin came first.  Theoretically a better cryptocurrency could come along, but it would need to seriously prove itself, and prove that the bitcoin protocol itself could not be improved to match. 
That being said, you're actually still an early adopter.  Being jealous of those who came before you and took bigger risks won't help a thing.  Don't focus so much on missed opportunities of the past, think about what can be done in the future!
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:38:22
This is an extremely personal question that is based on your position in life and your obligations.  
* The older you get 
* The more debt obligations you have
* The more people that depend on your income (spouse/family/etc)
* The higher standard of living you require
All of these factors (and more I'm sure) decrease the amount of your funds you can afford to risk.  
That being said, some days I do feel as if bitcoin is a safer long term investment.  It will go up and down in the long term, but years from now it will either be very highly valued, or have no value at all.

Did they (or the bank) give any specific information on why the wire failed? Those fees really, really suck by the way.

They can't shut the bitcoin network down, but they can try to outlaw services that attempt to deal with Bitcoin, and especially exchange it for USD. 
However, I do not think that this is very likely.  They will try to regulate and tax it, if anything.  Bitcoin is a valuable new tech and they know it.  If an outright ban is ever put in place, the technological development would gladly be picked up in another country (Sweden, Iceland, Germany, etc) and the US would simply miss out big time.

Look I am actually all for socialistic programs, but there is a point in which you want these managed by a government and NOT a payment protocol. 
There are cryptocurrencies that attempt to distribute funds around so that all of the users share wealth, but there are also ways to game the system and I will never use those kinds of altcoins as a store of value.

Check out your order history page, it will show exactly when they're supposed to arrive. Typically it's about 4 days, or more if it runs through a weekend.  
The price you paid is locked in at the time you order too, so you're not going to be charged any more (or receive any less bitcoin) as the market changes

Sorry to hear about what happened with bitspend, do you have an info on why they went down?

If you check the address on blockchain.info, it was probably a spam transaction designed to advertise a service (like a betting website)
Side note, I kind of enjoy the fact that advertisers literally have to pay you for this.  It's a nice change from the current system.

Change the passwords on EVERYTHING, especially your email account.  Contact the websites to determine if there's any suspicious activity on your account lately.  
look for security weaknesses where you may have used the same email/username/passwords on various sites, and run an antivirus scan pronto!  Might not be a bad idea to use a different computer to generate a cold storage wallet and send your funds there for the time being

You should be incredibly wary when going "all in" on any position.  Maximize profit? Sure, but you also maximize loss. 
Keep in mind that the bitcoin's market price is only as strong as the supporting bids underneath.  If you really want stability, then buy BTC and leave an open order where you'd like to buy more at a killer price in case the market drops later.  
* if the market drops, well then congrats you bought bitcoin on the cheap
* if the market doesn't drop, well then congrats your current bitcoin holdings are increasing in value due in part to your own bid support. 
If you wanted volatility though, then by all means go all-in whenever you can.
