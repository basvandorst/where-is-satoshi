There is some nice delusion going on that you are downvoted even though you link to a discussion of a Monero developer that confirms what you wrote.
Monero is a nice project but it scales absolutely horribly compared to Bitcoin. A simple transaction is 100x (yes, **100**) larger than in Bitcoin. If it ever becomes as popular as Bitcoin, either the fees would be astronomical, or it will have so large blocks that virtually nobody would be able to process them.

There are two segwit type addresses: segwit embedded in P2SH (the addresses start in 3) and native segiwt (addresses start with bc). The latter is better (the transactions are smaller but it is not yet supported by many wallets/exchanges). P2SH is an old standard, activated in 2012. There is 100% support for these type of addresses. I have been using P2SH-segiwt for a few months now with two dozen of transactions and I had (as expected) no problems whatsoever. I also did a few of the native segwit transactions without problems but it's practically impossible to receive to these addresses now unless you send it to yourself.

Interestingly, this block could have been 2.8 MB  if all transactions were native segwit (P2PWKH). The P2SH-segwit transactions that were responsible for the record could have been optimized with native segwit as P2SH creates an overhead.

1.7 MB is a low-end estimate. 1.9MB  is a more reasonable estimate based on the current usage. 
And this record block had a bunch of thick, large, multi-input multi-signature transactions that benefits most from segwit.

What you describe is not double spending, it's sending to two addresses. The network does not bundle anything. Your wallet software creates a transaction 0.3 to A and 0.7 to C (change). And if you spend later 0.3 to B, it will create a transaction form 0.7 in C 0.3 to B and 0.4 to D (new change). 
If you have a wallet that can do send to many, it can create a transaction 0.3 to A, 0.3 to B and 0.4 to C without creating an intermediate change and saving the size of the transactions and hence the fees.

It's worse than that because Bitstamp consolidated a few dozen of inputs in this transaction. Coinbase does input consolidation  separately so they are paying roughly twice of the 900 weight per output sent. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:06:31
I simply analyzed example transactions but it can be taken from the [transaction format](
Transaction data independent of inputs/outputs is the easiest. Each transaction has 4-byte version and 4-byte sequence. Also, the number of inputs (1 byte for less than 253 inputs) and the number of outputs (1 byte for less than 253 oututs). The total is 10 bytes (or 12 if more than 252 inputs/outputs or 14 if morre than both 252 inputs and outputs).
Outputs are also easy. Each output has  8-byte value, 1-byte size (if less than 253 bytes) and the script. The script is for legacy: OP_DUP OP_HASH push(20) &lt;20-byte-script-hash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG, 25-bytes for the script. It sums to 34-bytes (error below my table corrected). 
For segwit, [consult BIP141](
For P2SH, we have HASH160 push(20) &lt;20-byte-script-hash&gt; EQUAL, 23-bytes script, 32 bytes output. And finally, P2WPKH (bech32) is OP_0 push(20) &lt;20-byte-script-hash&gt;, 22-byte script, 31-bytes output.
Now inputs.  Each input has a 36-byte previous output outpoint (32-bytes txid and 4-bytes output number), 1-byte scriptsig size (if less than 253-bytes), scriptsig and 4-byte sequence. Scriptsig is push(size) signature push(size) pubkey, so size of signature + size of pubkey +2. 
[Signature is 71-73 bytes]( 7 bytes overhead (including sighhash) plus r and s. R and s can be 32 or 33 bytes (can be also smaller with small probability). 
pubkey is 33 bytes. Total legacy input is 36+1+1+71/73+1+33+4=147-149. For some unknown to me reasons (due to BIP62?), 73-byte signature is currently very rare is almost exclusively inputs are 147-148. 
So the legacy 1/1 is 10+147/149+34=191/193.
Now with segwit (see BIP141, BIP143 and BIP144). P2WPKH is simpler. Base data for input is  36-byte previous output outpoint 1-byte scriptsig size (zero scriptsig) and 4-byte sequence. Witness is  1-byte number of witness elements, 1-byte pushcode, 71/73 bytes signature, 1-byte pushcode, 33-bytes pubkey. So total vsize is (36+1+4)+(1+1+71/73+1+33)/4=67.75-68.25 vbytes. But it's not enough. Segwit introduces extra two bytes regardless of the number of inputs (see BIP144) so there is 0.5 vbytes extra per transaction. 
Summing up, bech32-&gt;bech32 transaction is 67.75/68.25 + 10+0.5+31=109.25/109.75. 
Now p2sh-segwit inputs adds an extra 23 bytes in scriptSig (see BIP141). So 90.75/91.25 per input. p2sh-segwit-&gt;p2sh-segwit is 23 bytes more per input and 1 more per output compared to pure bech32=133.25/133.75 vbytes.

I think this study is outdated. Bitcoin Core improved, heck even 0.15 is much faster than 0.14. And Segwit has O(N) instead of O( N^2 ) signature checking cost. It may be risky to have 8 MB blocks but 2MB work just fine.

Kraken as far as I know supports segwit. You may have meant other exchanges. 
And this change situation is not that simple. Normally, the change is fully automatic (address and amount). If you want to have segwit in Bitcoin Core stable (because there is a working fully segwit wallet in the developer version with automatic change and extra bech32 support in the testing stage), you have to generate a new address, "segwitize" it and explicitly specify it in the transaction (both amount and address). So a few extra steps.
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:16:41
A single private key should start with L or K (do not post it anywhere!). 
You should import it to Electrum with File|New/Restore, enter wallet name, Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys, enter the key, click next, put password and the wallet should sync and show balance. At the receive tab you should see the address. Then you can send it anywhere (do not forget specifying "replace by fee" that will allow bumping), including your newly created segwit wallet that you can create any time (before or after importing).  Electrum uses bech32 segwit which is fine for sending but you will have problems with receiving to this wallet. You can also create [P2SH-segwit wallet in Electrum with a few extra steps]( 
Alternatively, you can do Wallet|Private keys|sweep after creating a segwit wallet first but the former way is more universal, you have more control over the sending process.

The smallest Monero transaction with the default mixing is roughly 13kB. Smallest Bitcoin one is 192 bytes, a factor of 67x, so indeed 100x is a bit of rounding up on my side. Typical transaction (2 input/2 outputs) is 226 bytes, a factor of   57x. 
~7x is still a lot. And Bitcoin will have Schnorr, MASTx, etc and will also scale better.

You set up your own fees. The fee shown in the wallet are only **suggestions** and are frequently widely pessimistic. 
The block inclusion is an auction. The miners include highest-paying transactions. Since block space is limited, the crucial is the fee per byte (because miners prioritize highest-per-byte-paying transactions). So the fee you set up depend on the size (which is related to a type of transaction and how many inputs and outputs there are) and with the satoshi per byte rate (satoshi is 10^-8 BTC). At this moment the 1MB cutoff is [between 5 and 6 satoshi per byte]( So if your transaction is 190 bytes (Electrum will show it when you click preview) and you multiply it by 6 satoshi per byte, you'll pay .0114 mBTC which is about $0.13 and you'll have a high probability (but not certainty) to have it confirmed in the next block.  It is good to select replace-by-fee that allows later to bump the fee if necessary.
You do not have to transfer to a segwit wallet at all. But transactions later sent **from** segwit addresses are smaller in virtual size (the thing that matters) and hence cheaper. So you may transfer now (when the fees are cheap) and save on the fees later. But this is all up to you. See, [this table for comparison on sizes of the transactions](

The mining revenue is directly proportional to the cost of disrupting the Bitcoin network by the 51% attack. So you can pick up two choices, either Bitcoin transactions are expensive or insecure. There is no way around it. 
The cost per transaction can be mitigated by increasing the block size (hence the number of transactions) but this is not without multiple problems that you should be aware if you followed the heated scaling debate. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:19:03
Because these type of transactions currently  have low fees. When the blocks are far apart, the miners pick up mostly recent transaction paying &gt;10 sat/byte. If there are blocks quick apart the former already picked up the higher-paying transactions and the next block must dig deeper into the bottom of the mempool.

Well, it is definitely not a wide consensus. First of all, Bitcoin has the widest community of all crypto and they do not share this view. Moreover, there are friendly to bitcoin altcoins like LTC and to a slightly less extent, XMR. 
Bitcoin is obviously not better in everything. But Bitcoin is not just the first. It is the most secure (the longest history with no loss of funds due to protocol mishaps, the strongest mining, hence the most expensive 51% attack) and the most decentralized coin available. It is not easy to beat. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:12:43


Rational markets (ehm, I know) should have already priced it. But even if not, only 20% of the coins are left to be mined. This supply is dwarfed by the already mined coins. The hypothetical future BTC price increase can only happen due to the extra demand because supply is not going to change much. 
But regardless of the BTC price, the cost of 51% attack should always be related to the total market value. It will be not safe to protect (let's be hypothetically optimistic) a $10 trillion market with a few billion of mining equipment. And if there are not enough fees (say only 0.25 BTC per block worth the current 12.5 BTC),  this is going to be the outcome, current difficulty and relatively low cost of 51% attack.

BCash is not faster. It processes 1 block per 10 minutes. The blocks can carry up to 8MB of data but there were only 2 such in the history of BCash. They are now only 400 kB on average, mostly carrying weird transactions. (the average transaction in BCash is over 1KB while it's 500 bytes in Bitcoin. BCash has lower fees mostly because there are much fewer users. 
But moreover, BCash removed Segwit, a protocol soft fork that removed transaction malleability (among other improvement) and removed replace-by-fee a mechanism to bump the fee after sending.

This was an argument against segwit2x which just increased the block size and not did not fix the O(N^2 ) signature validation of legacy transactions. 
It has been fixed in BCash in a rather funny way. BCH which hates segwit with passion used the preimage algorithm from segwit. So all transactions in BCH are hashed before signing just like the witness in segwit. The segwit algorithm is O(N). 
In a hypothetical future Bitcoin hardfork that increases the block size, I'm pretty sure it will be done in a similar way. It has a minor drawback. All unconfirmed legacy transactions will become invalid at the fork time. They would have to be resubmitted with the new transaction format.  Also, all SPV clients will have to be updated in a similar way.

If you only send and never receive you don't have to be online at all (except for sending).
If you receive, you have to be online when receiving funds and you have to monitor the blockchain if the old channel state (where you have less than now) was mined. If it was, you would need to publish the penalty transaction before the time lock expires (current default 144 blocks).  You can presign this transaction and send it to a third party (watchtowers). You can send it to multiple watchtowers. Since penalty transactions award all the channel balance to you (so more than you have), you can use the extra balance as a mining fee and a possible watchtower fee. The watchtower functionality is possible in the protocol but as far as I know it is not yet coded. For the watchtower, malleability fix is essential because you can only sign a transaction in advance if the input TXID cannot change. 
I expect the penalty transactions will be very rare. The threat of the penalty will be enough to deter the cheaters.

Opening a channel is a set of two transactions, one sent to the blockchain (funding transaction that is send to a multisignature address that both parties have keys) and the other is kept private (refund transaction). At the time of the opening, the refund transaction simply return the whole balance to the party that opened the channel. LN transactions update the refund transaction. If Alice had 0.1 BTC and Bob 0.0 and Alice pays 0.01 to Bob, the refund transaction is updated from 0.1 to Alice and 0.0 to Bob to 0.09 to Alice and 0.01 to Bob. How to do it in a trustless way is beyond ELI5 but it can be done. The transactions can be done indefinitely as long as the total balance is not greater than the opening transaction. So Alice can pay up to 0.09 to Bob and Bob can pay up to 0.01 to Alice after the first transaction. If Alice pays 0.01 again to Bob,  she will be able to pay up to 0.08 BTC to Bob and Bob 0.02 BTC to Alice, etc.  
The whole LN magic is actually that Alice can pay not only Bob but Carol if Carol has a channel with Bob but not with Alice. Bob will route the payment and collect a small fee. Therefore, if you have a channel open with some well-connected party you can pay anyone in LN. 
1. You have to have at least one open channel in LN to get funds (and the channel has to have receive capacity). 
2. Electrum has a development version to participate in LN. I have no idea how mature it is. LN is still alpha software so it is probable still quite rough.  
3. Fully interoperable. LN channel balance can be settled on the blockchain any time. The refund transaction is a valid transaction on the blockchain.

The irony of this transaction is that this is an example of blockchain bloat. The transaction contains tiny outputs (less than $3 each), somebody would have to pay a lot of fees to consolidate it. If you follow the outputs you can see  [such a transaction like this one]( spending $14 of coins, paying almost $13 in fees.
All those fee-free transfers (and Bitstamp has such) contributes to the blockchain bloat. We should not record for all eternity such a trivial and economically nonsensical transactions.

This block was not typical because it came long after the previous one. Hence, you had to pay way more than 10 sat/byte to have the transactions confirmed. 
Even if the running rate is 10 sat/byte, from time to time, there will be blocks that required 200+ sat/ byte. So if you really must have a confirmation in the next block, you must set up a large fee. But if you can occasionally wait a block or two 20 sat/byte was OK and 11 sat/byte would be OK for waiting a few blocks. 
The best strategy for quick and reasonably cheap confirmation (and I wonder why so unpopular) is to send with the fee barely enough under the top 1MB in the mempool and increase it the with RBF to stay over the cut-off line.  This way, if you had been lucky, you would have paid 11 sat/byte for immediate confirmation and if you had a bad luck with something like block  you would have paid more but still get a confirmation.  
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:35:23
You have to have a wallet with the  RBF support and select it while sending. Electrum has the most flexible one (you can RBF all transactions), Bitcoin Core has one (but transaction must have a  change and it is not fine-tunable). I don't know other wallets.
If your transaction was marked RBF, you can select "increase the fee" afterwards and change the fee as many time as you like (while unconfirmed). But each change must be upward and at least 1 sat/byte higher.

You have to have a malleability fix for the LN watchtowers. And the only not whack-a-mole-type malleability fix is segwit or something equivalent to segwit (i.e, not hashing the signature). 
Even if BCash managed somehow to make it without segwit, current LN BOLT standard requires segwit so they would have to create their own protocol, code it and then they would have a non-interoperable network. 
So, yeah it is possible but then it will not be LN but LN-like. Just like BCash is BTC-like.

I think you can do it now manually (haven't tried it though). You can create a raw transaction in Core via command line interface, sign it with ledger (via Electrum or python interface or other tools) and broadcast it with Core.

It takes much more money to kill of influence BTC than any random altcoin. Firstly, 51% attack on Bitcoin is the most expensive of all because it has the strongest and most expensive mining.

It is highly unlikely. There will be not enough capital between you and the destination even counting all the paths. Moreover, the LN fees for large transactions will be comparable or higher than on the chain. 
In the blockchain, the scarce resource is the block space, in LN the scarce resource is the committed capital. Blockchain has a limit on the number of transactions but they can be of arbitrary value. In LN, it is the opposite, there can be arbitrary many transactions but they can be of limited size. LN protocol implements fee per value and for large transactions, the fee will be substantial.

Since the average block size has not decreased, the size of the transaction must have gone up. And it can mean either more inputs (consolidations), more outputs (batching), or more complicated transactions (e.g. multisignatures).  
Last 144 blocks averages:
transactions/block inputs/block outputs/block inputs/transaction outputs/transaction
1331.20 5039.27 4175.25 3.78 3.136
If you compare it with [an analysis I did two weeks ago]( there are more inputs per transaction, more outputs per transaction and the transactions themselves are larger. There are actually less outputs per block but slightly more inputs so the change in the transaction mix is rather brought by consolidations (in many cases from [large-size multi-signatures like these]( than batching. 
It seems there is less simple 1 input/2 output traffic (individuals but also Coinbase that does not know how to batch) but more consolidations. And indeed, the [unspent transaction outputs are going down](  
On the other hand, cheap fees brought us [transactions like these]( There are tons of these is recent blocks. They look like distributing free samples. But $1 coin is not easy to spend (sure now, yes but low fees may not last) and the recipient may be later disappointed when they try to spend it.

After coinbase reductions, the (almost) only mining revenue is from the fees. The fees will be the only thing that prevents the 51% attack. 
Currently, we are mostly protected by inflation. But after a few next halvenings, the coinbase revenue would be too small to support a difficult to disrupt  mining.  If there are not enough fees, miners will turn off the equipment, the difficulty will drop and the 51% attack becomes cheap to execute.

Of course they are. The larger the miner revenue, the larger difficulty. The larger difficulty, the larger hashrate required for the 51% attack. The larger hashrate, the larger cost.
Miner revenue and difficulty relation has a lag. It takes time before miners invest in the new equipment (and producers create them) but in long term, it is completely correlated.  
Since difficulty grew more than Bitcoin price due to ASIC specialization and due to the lags and slow reaction of the difficulty to the BTC price (and two halvenings), the [difficulty](
 and 
    [BTC price]( graphs are not identical but are very similar. Difficulty jumps a lot during bull markets and slows down or even drops during bear markets.

Unless, you use some kind of escrow, you can always be cheated by a dishonest merchant. And therefore, you can also be cheated by a hacker pretending to be a merchant.

In the current specification, blockchain fees are paid by the party that initiates the channel. 
Yes, the maximum that can be sent is the channel balance (minus reserve) but the channel can be refilled indefinitely. In theory, you could open a channel, spend from it and get it refilled it via paycheck from your employer. 
You front the bitcoins when you open the channel and I'm not sure if the funding can be done (in the current specification) by both sides. In theory, this is possible.

A few problems. 
1. Bigger blocks make running full nodes more expensive, leading to less security (less actors verify independently the blockchain). It's not just storage but CPU time for verifying blocks and bandwidth to download/upload it fast enough not to be out of sync with the rest of the Bitcoin network. Many attack vectors impossible against full nodes are possible against light nodes and if a larger fraction of users is only on light nodes, the global security suffers. Full nodes provide something akin to herd immunity. 
2. Bigger blocks propagate slower, leading to more block orphaning and mining centralization (pools with more hashrate are less prone to orphaning). Currently, Bitcoin has a very low orphaning rate, but it used to be a bigger problem before FIBRE inter-pool network and compact blocks. With bigger blocks we may return to 2013-level pool centralization. 
3. Blocks size increase requires a hard fork. Such an operation is risky and require careful planning. There has never been an intentional hard fork in Bitcoin post-Satoshi history (some accidental forks may be regarded as hard forks but they were resolved with mining majority).
It does not mean that the block size increase will never happen. Some modest increase is not out of question, preferably with some mechanism for future increases without constant forking. But we cannot do it willy-nilly without  considering both the centralization tradeoffs and the hard fork risks.

This is outside of the main topic but is so wrong that I have to correct it. The reason CO_2 absorbs infrared radiation so well has nothing to do with its mass and its number of electrons. The infrared radiation excites nuclear vibrations and absorption is allowed (in the first order) if the molecule changes the dipole moment during vibration. By symmetry, O_2 cannot change its dipole moment via any vibration, while CO_2, being a three-atom molecule, can change the dipole moment by bending.  
This difference is huge, N_2/O_2 and Ar are virtually transparent to infrared radiation while CO_2 is opaque. CO_2  absorbs IR radiation many orders of magnitude more than the main air constituents, hence only small concentrations of CO_2 have a large impact on the IR radiation profile. 
I like your Bitcoin comments and don't take it personally but, please, educate yourself more before you talk about greenhouse effect and global warming.

This is very simple. It is moved so the transaction ID does not depend on the signature. This is the "one ring to rule them all"  maleability fix. Transaction ID depending on the signature was one of the biggest Satoshi's design errors. 


You are completely missing the point, I'm afraid. A hard-fork is not an open-source fork equivalent. If you fork Firefox to make Palemoon (real world example), you get two browsers that are inter-operable, you can browse the same pages, import the bookmarks, you can move to Palemoon from Firefox and back many times without any problems. Heck, you can even use the Palemoon code in Firefox and vice versa so the forks actually can improve the ecosystem. 
With Bitcoin hard-fork, you create a parallel universe with no way to travel between them. The community is effectively split. In the worst case of forks without replay protection, you create a bizarre world, where blocks are not valid between the forks but  transactions are valid on both chains, making the loss of funds a huge possibility. 


It's one of the factors but not the only one. The other is the orphaning rate and the risk of mining centralization. Large pools have smaller risk of orphaning and in the world with large orphaning rates, mining will gravitate into larger and larger pools. We had this problem in 2013 before FIBRE network was created and compact blocks were introduced. Without that we would have had a lot of problems with even 1MB blocks. It's easy to take it for granted. 


Although I'm not completely opposed to the idea of modest block size increase, you are underestimating the problems and overestimating the Moore law progress that slowed down significantly. Not everything can be parallelized in Bitcoin (transactions that depend on other transactions cannot be processed parallelly) and single-thread CPU performance is virtually constant for the last several years. Bandwidth is also a factor and in some countries (e.g. Australia) data caps are common, we could effectively remove the whole continent from the Bitcoin ecosystem with too large blocks.  
Also, the block size implies the size of unspent output database (UTXO) which is the most expensive externality.  


On the other hand, the central risk to Bitcoin is and has always been mining power. Owning a majority of hashpower is the only way to attack the blockchain itself, 
No, full nodes are the only way to protect against cheating miners. Miners can only 51% attack the network if they play by their rules. And this attack is practically impossible for profit.
On the other hand in a world, where only miners run full nodes, they can collude and create an "inflacoin", Bitcoin with permanent inflation, removing the 21 million limit and the rest of the economy on the light nodes would not even notice the change. With the economy of full nodes, the inflacoin is immediately invalidated and the nodes can safely transact in the old fashioned bitcoin. 
Full nodes create a herd immunity for the Bitcoin ecosystem. 


This is well justified since segwit transactions are cheaper to validate. Legacy transactions have to be phased out and without the financial motivation it would not have happened.

Yes, and moreover the current LN standard and implementations require segwit so any future potential malleability-fixed BCH would require rewriting lightning network standard and implementation and the resulting BCH-LN would not be interoperable with the main LN. The LN is for example interoperable between BTC and LTC via atomic swaps.

There is no environmental variable anymore. The signing is correctly performed if the key is of type p2wpkh.
So I added 
 t = 'p2wpkh' if derivation.startswith("m/173'") else 'standard'
after 
t = 'p2wpkh-p2sh' if derivation.startswith("m/49'") else 'standard'  # bip43
in lib/keystore.py
and similarly 
if derivation.startswith("m/173'/"):
           xtype = 'p2wpkh'
in lib/base_wizard.py
Then, you create new wallet, hardware wallet, derivation m/173'/1'/0'  for testnet or m/173'/0'/0' for mainnet. This derivation path is my own invention and unless standardized, it's not going to be interoperable. 
I tested it on testnet a lot with no problems (except for the minor glitch with sending to P2WSH addresses). I would even use it for mainnet but without the standard derivation path, it would be a lot of problems if the standard is different.

Yes, 3 transactions. Old two and a new one. Sum the size of all of them, multiply by current fee (500-ish sat/byte, I'm afraid) and subtract the old fees. This should be the new fee. 
Double check the calculations because fees are now very high and each error would cost you another fee. It is also good to have a wallet with coin control because otherwise you may send new transaction from a coin that was not a part of these two old transactions. And in this case, it's not going to work. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:06:40
The parent was incorrect saying that witness data is a separate block structure. Witness in inside the transactions. Maybe that's creating the confusion. 
The rationale is simple. Segwit transactions are cheaper for the full nodes to verify, we should push for their adoption (and also they fix malleability, allow futures script versioning, give better security for multisignatures). If with the significant discount, the segwit adoption is slow, what do you think would have happened without it? 
So you may ask why weight and not other way? It turns out that weight might be more difficult for humans but it is better for the machines. With a single limit, it is easier to optimize the fee-maximization algorithm of block inclusion. See the section [Moving towards a single combined block limit](

[This site shows the mempool evolution]( and there are 31MB of transactions 80+ satoshi/byte. Despite the blocks going indeed faster recently than 1 per 10 minutes, the mempool is not clearing, hence the rate of transactions is matching the rate of block creation. There will be some slowdown in transactions when Americas go to bed (for some unknown reasons, despite large trading in Asia, Asia makes less transactions than Americas) but the streak of mining luck will not continue so long. 
I love sending transactions with absolutely minimum fees to confirm but I can bet that within 24 hours a transaction with 71-90 sat/byte will not confirm.  Next days, who knows. Christmas is coming and the mempool will probably clear substantially but before then, it is unlikely.

It's very simple to use segwit. Use a segwit-supporting wallet. Both hardware wallets, namely Ledger and Trezor support segwit addresses. Software wallet Electrum also supports it (but see below). I do not know Samurai but apparently it also supports segwit. 
There are two versions of segwit addresses, one that start with number 3 (these are completely compatible with everything), and the newer ones starting with "bc" that are better but not yet widely supported. If you are not experienced, use the former one. Electrum by default creates the new format (if you choose segwit). You can create those that start with "3" but it is more difficult. 
Segwit2x has really (despite the name) not much to do with Segwit. Segwit2x is a failed project to increase the Bitcoin block size 2 times (hence the 2x label) on top of Segwit. Segwit was sucessful, Segwit2x failed. Coinbase supported Segwit2x but since it failed, there is nothing to worry about (except the fact that they spend so much time and energy on a much criticized project). 
Coinbase does not use segwit but it's their problem not yours. Everybody who sends from a segwit address benefits from segwit. And you can send from a segwit address to anybody (both segwit and non-segwit). If you have the segwit address that start wth 3, you can also receive funds from anybody. If the receiver does not use segwit,  they simply do not benefit from that. 
Segwit makes the transaction effectively smaller (therefore cheaper because fee is related to the size), fixes transaction malleability, enables use of these funds in future second-layer solutions (like so-called Lightning Network) and makes the transactions easier to verify for everybody.

Current 1MB cut-off is 230 sat/byte on my mempool. There are only 1.5 MB of transactions above 150 sat/byte. With some small luck, it should confirm soon (a few blocks). Today many 110 sat/byte transactions were clearing earlier.

Core uses Segwit since 0.13.0. It understands the segwit transactions, relays them and validates them. You can also create a Segwit addresses in the console (via addwitnessaddress) and in the github version you can also create, send to and receive from bech32 addresses. 
Automatic support of segwit addresses is currently [prepared here]( It's not easy to make it conservatively so the funds are not at risk. It must survive many scenarios that are not typical but Core developers are conservative, it's better to make it right than fast. The scenarios are: user uses Segwit but loses the wallet. The backup wallet is from older version without Segwit. User uses Segwit but downgrades the software, etc.

On the other hand, they are completely clueless about it. 
Replying to the main post, one of the current LN implementation (lnd) has so-called "autopilot" mode, where it creates and maintains the channels automatically. But on testnet, where coins are free, it is a nice thing. On mainnet,  each opening and closing of the channel costs money in fees so I'm not sure many will be brave to leave it to bots. 
Also, eclair mobile wallet has it very simple: you click to open a channel, select the funds committed and that's it (but you need to wait for the confirmations before using the channel). 
Bitcoin and the related technology has never been for newbies, though. And probably will never be. Well, it is not that bad, newbies has either learned and stopped being newbies or left. But I'm afraid the main benefits of Bitcoin that it is a decentralized, permissionless, trustless, deflationary and pseudonymous currency has very little mass public appeal. Main appeal for mass public is only "Bitcoin can make me rich".

The current standard states: [the sending node]
[MUST set funding_satoshis to less than 2^24 satoshi]( 2^24 satoshi = 0.1667 BTC. 
Even if this limit is eventually lifted, there is a finite amount of BTC on a path from you to your recipient. Even if exchanges would  open some super high-capacity channels, in case of arbitrage opportunity, the channels would be very quickly depleted. 
The protocol recognizes the problem of capital and sets a fee per value. So even if sending $0.01 would cost, say, $0.0001, sending $1000 would cost much more, probably $1 and sending $100000 would probably cost more than on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:08:10


I don't know. possibility of sending $0.01 transactions with $0.0001 fee? Possibility of reloading the channel by receiving funds, therefore having it open indefinitely? Earning fee by transaction forwarding? And best of all, having it all trustless, psuedonymous and censorship free?
Two other issues. In the current standard, the channel is limited to 0.1667 BTC so there will be no possibility of freezing 10 BTC (unless you open very many channels).  I'm not sure it is currently supported, but it would be no problem to spend the part of the channel balance in a regular blockchain transaction without needing to open and close the channel separately if the partner cooperates. Your transaction would close the channel, send a part of the balance to outside address and open a new channel all in one transaction.

Because you shouldn't trust miners. Without verifying all the transactions, you cannot know if a miner didn't add an extra 1 BTC to his mining reward (why? Because you have to verify all the transactions to see how large the fees are in the current block). Sure, other miners can detect it but who is right? Maybe the other miners try to play some games to blame the others? Without full nodes, the rules can be broken and before the dust settles, you may wake up in a world with &gt;21 million bitcoins.

This is probably too clever to write without diagrams. So consult [Figure 8 of the lightning network whitepaper]( and [this stack exchange post](
The essence of the cleverness is that Alice and Bob have both a different sets of transactions to broadcast. And the address to spend is a pay to hash script which has a conditional. One key can spend it immediately and the other only after some time. In the transaction Alice can broadcast, she has the_after_some_time key but she has only half of the immediate key (the other half has Bob). When Alice updates the channel balance paying Bob, she has to send Bob her half of the key that unlocks the funds immediately from the previous transaction (where Bob has less). Bob has the public key so he can check if the half he just got from Alice unlocks it correctly and only then he signs the new channel update, where he has less. Alice still has the time locked key but if she tries to publish the old transaction, Bob has the key that unlocks the funds immediately.  But Bob cannot spend these funds unless Alice broadcasts the old transaction which he cannot force her to do (Bob has a mirror transaction only, where his funds are timelocked and Alice has a half of the key to spend it immediately). Only if Alice wants to trick Bob by publishing the old transaction, he can spot it and spend the funds in a penalty transaction. 
My head hurt when I first tried to understand it and, boy, this is clever. But after understanding that (though there are still some details I don't understand), I realized that Lightning Network is as ground breaking as Bitcoin itself.

Do you run your full node? Even now, if I get 5 blocks within 10 minutes (it happens almost daily), my desktop node chokes. It could not verify the previous blocks and new blocks arrive. With larger blocks the network becomes unsynchronized. 
With larger blocks, there is a huge incentive to centralize mining because smaller miners are in disadvantage due to higher probability of orphaned blocks. 
Then, you have the UTXO growth. This database should be kept in memory and it grows even with blocks because there are more and more users. One single bad decision (letting large blocks) and in a short time, you can only run full node with an enterprise-quality server.

Short answer: no. Long answer: Any proof of work must be hard to calculate and easy to verify. There are virtually no scientific simulations that have such a property. Even if they are fast to verify CPU-wise, they would require a lot of data. 
Moreover, in order to work it as a blockchain, this scientific discovery would have to depend on the transactions. One could have a [Mersenne prime search]( as a proof of work and it would work to create empty blocks (if you didn't care that the blocks would happen every few years). But linking the transactions? I can't find it possible.

If you don't control the inputs or outputs there is nothing you can do (most of if not all of the acceleration services are either ripoffs or scams). You need to ask the sender to do RBF, or recipient to do CPFP. Or after some time, the transaction will get dropped from the wallet and could be resent with higher fee (but there is no guarantee that this transaction may not go through someday).

Schnorr in Bitcoin does not exist except as a general concept so I have no idea how it is going to be implemented. 
But current legacy outputs contain the following script:
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 hash OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
Bitcoin would effectively have to ignore it to schnorrify and this is a nightmare to make without breaking something (and probably impossible without a hard fork).  
[BIP141 suggest that Schnorr will have a new version number]( that would mean, I'm afraid, that even current segwit outputs may not be Schnorrable.

I'd like to add that there are fees per value in the LN protocol. So a large transaction can deplete the channel (but not completely, there are limits of the transaction value relative to the channel size) but it will cost the attacker. Moreover, fees for the channel are dynamic and asymmetric. You can ramp up the fees when the channel gets depleted on the send site and keep them small on the receiving site so depleting the channel gets much more expensive than replenishing it.  
Channel imbalance is a potential problem in LN, but it can be mitigated. Moreover, if the LN network is robust, it will only change the LN topology that should work as efficiently.

Why don't you first read a thorough explanation about [segwit benefits]( and [segwit drawbacks]( It is very well explained, in particular in the section "Risks due to larger blocks". 
Segwit is a block increase but on the other hand, the segwit signatures are cheaper to verify and the witness discount creates some rebalancing between the size of the outputs and inputs. For the Bitcoin network, the unspent outputs (UTXO) are the largest externality, yet legacy transactions have a large input size and small output size, making it hard to consolidate the UTXO. In segwit, the proportion  is improved (by witness weight discount), making consolidation of the output  (and reducing the UTXO size) cheaper.

No, it's not that bad. I've just analyzed last 144 blocks, and the blocks would have been 1.88 MB on average if fully segwit. 1.61MB was the lowest and 2.15 MB the highest. Of course, there will always be some old legacy transactions (but only 1% of the inputs in the current transactions are older than block  481824, the segwit activation block, so it would quickly die down if everybody switched to segwit) but on the other hand segwit may change the block structure toward slightly more savings. 
Notice, that the above figure are for pure P2WPKH transactions, theose with bech32 addresses. P2SH embedding removes some of the savings.

Yes, indeed.  
If you are super paranoid, install Bitcoin Core and electrumx server as well (the latter is hard). This is, in my opinion, the safest and at the same time the most useful Bitcoin wallet combination (if combined with hardware wallet, offline signing or watch only wallet). This way, Electrum will query electrumx server which will query your Bitcoin Core  and nobody except you will know that these are your coins. Standard Electrum will ask some random servers on the Internet about the coins and although tries to obfuscate it a bit (by asking more than it should) but somebody can probably guess that your IP number is likely connected with these coins.

It's not a major problem for several reasons. First of all, there is no lockup. It's not that you deposited money and they can refuse to pay you back. If someone starts to play dirty, you leave. Secondly, it will be still very decentralized. It's like with airports (but better), you can connect through many hubs, there are many, many multihop routes to the destination. It's not Paypal 2.0 where everybody has to have accounts in Paypal 2.0. It's better than airlines because you can yourself create your own airline connecting your Podunk with any airport in the world. Lastly, any centralization on top of decentralized Bitcoin is much less of a concern than centralized Bitcoin. 


This is not free and not without tradeoffs. It's a transfer of cost form transaction makers to full node users. The limit can probably be raised  (though it is raised to effectively 2MB by Segwit and only 10% users cared to upgrade) somewhat but if a full node cannot be run on a home computer with home internet connection, Bitcoin will quickly become dangerously centralized.  [Read more in my previous post](
1 minute block time with large blocks will make mining completely centralized. Because orphaning rates would skyrocket and small miners that are much more prone to orphaning would drop from the market.

By the way. Total number of transaction is actually meaningless. Even 100,000 1 sat/byte transaction would not make a difference.
What is important is the size of the transactions above some reasonable level, e.g. 100, 50, 20, 10, or 5. Any level you want to transact on.

The blockchain space is wasted so much that it's hard to believe businesses can be so wasteful. Many, many exchanges do not batch the transactions and instead of sending 1 transaction to 20 recipients, they send 20 separate transactions. A 20 recipient legacy transaction is 834 bytes while 20 separate ones are 226 each, totaling 4520 bytes, more than 5 times more. Segwit helps but it's still 3320 vbytes vs 751.

Ledger firmware 1.10 supports bech32 (with minor glitches, like cut P2WSH address which is longer than P2WPKH). Electrum has a code to support this Ledger feature but it's switched off (I enabled it and it works on testnet, though I was i bit too scared to use an unofficial feature on mainnet).  So I guess the hardest part of the bech32 support in Ledger is done. 
With the current Core github HEAD version  you can send to bech32 from GUI but receiving  address must be generated by addwitnessaddress. Full wallet support (for both P2SH-P2WPKH and bech32) [is being worked on](

No, no, no. There is no expiration. The default mempool removal in Bitcoin Core is 14 days (it used to be 3 days but now it is 14). But you can never be sure that some miner does not have a longer limit. 
The only way to "remove" a transaction is to double spend it (i.e spend again the same coins if the wallet allows it). You should never assume that the original one will not go through. 
The fees are currently trending down. If the fees is not very small it may confirm today.

During a bursting bubble or hypothetical crash of bitcoin the altcoins will fall down even faster. 
Altcoins are the empirical proof that we have a cryptocurrency bubble. Most of the altcoins are outright scams, majority of the rest are just copycasts (plus scams). There are maybe a few of the altcoins that have some utility. Yet, it is a multibillion dollar market. 
Altcoins are also (hidden) inflation. There are 21 million of bitcoins but infinite number of altcoins. And inflation masks problems (fees can be free because the miners are paid by inflation) and inflation always at some point shows its ugly face.

No, soft fork would be enough. Soft fork makes previously valid blocks invalid so you can tighten rules.
Also, without any forks Bitcoin Core can make, e.g. the transactions to legacy addresses non-standard. After nodes upgrade, it would be difficult to find a node that would relay such transactions and people would have to switch.  Sending from would be unaffected so no problems with spending from legacy addresses.  
However, both changes would be pretty controversial so it's unlikely to be implemented.

By opening a channel, you send bitcoins to a multisignature address where you have one key and your counterparty has the other. Simultaneously, you get a signed (by counterparty) refund transaction to yourself. You have to protect your key and not lose the refund transaction. LN transactions are simply an update to the refund transaction. 


Yes but the coffee shop will be able to pay you back or pay anybody in LN if you have another channel open (and this channel is not a dead end) and you are willing to route payments. 


A blockchain transaction to a segwit multisignature address. If you have segwit (and segwit is required for LN), it's small in vsize (i.e. size with witness discount). [This is a LN channel opening transaction]( 153 vbytes, less than 226 standard legacy transaction.  


[This is a channel closing transaction]( 149 vbytes. It would have been 180 bytes if the refund went to two parties, instead of one.  
Miners mine it as a regular transaction with regular mining fees. Signatures are exchanged between you and your counterparty during channel opening and channel transactions. 


By publishing the channel closing transaction. It can be done cooperatively (the other party signs a new closing transaction), in this case it is instant (plus waiting for block inclusion) or without counterparty involvement, where the presigned transaction is timelocked (current defualt as far as I remember 144 blocks). This time lock allows the counterparty to check if you are not cheating (by publishing an old transaction where you have more funds) and publish a penalty transaction. If your transaction is the last one (you have not published a previous one), it will confirm after 144 blocks. 


Yes and no. First of all, LN is not for paying large sums. It's the exact opposite of Bitcoin blockchain, where the number of transactions is limited but they can be of arbitrary value. In LN, the number of transactions is arbitrary but their value is limited. 
It does not make sense to open a LN channel for one transaction. But if you have a channel open to a place that is well connected and the business you want to transact with has a channel open to a well connected party, you can pay your hub and the hub will route the payment to the other hub and maybe another one and then to your business. Think about it like Internet packet routing. 
So you can pay for coffee even if you both are not directly connected.

I don't know the details of your wallet but if you are not in a hurry, wait. If you are and your wallet lets you do it, send it with a larger fee. [Monitor the mempool]( and set the fee accordingly. If your wallet allows for replace-by-fee, set it. It allows for bumping the fee later.

This is a fourth major wave in Bitcoin. Many newbies arrived when bitcoin reached $30 (then it crashed to $2), the next wave was with $100 (there was no major crash but a correction and some stabilization), and then with $1000. Every time it looked the same. And every time, they brought many problems but also new blood. And after the correction, newbies either left or become non-newbies and the Bitcoin universe grew. And the cycle repeated. Is the cycle going to repeat again? Who knows. But Bitcoin is going to evolve and only a few major things are set in stone: no central entity, no censorship, open source, pseudonymity,  and 21 million BTC.

The prediction about a civil war between hodlers and transactionistas over the introduction of inflation is a very interesting one. Because, indeed, these groups have vastly different priorities. Holders want the best value and transactionistas want cheap transactions. The former is secured by no inflation, while the latter will want a never ending subsidy. 
Although, I sympathize with the no-inflation camp, there is some merit in hodlers getting a free ride. In the era, where only the fees pay for (most of) the mining, holdlers pay nothing for mining securing their wealth, yet benefit greatly from the security it provides. 
Interestingly, [this topic was discussed as early as 2011]( and at the time, the contentious forks were unimaginable.

It's not difficult. The last graph is the most relevant. Since each block is maximum 1 MB virtual size, if you look at which band the 1MB cutoff is, you can see which transactions will get through (the ones that do not fill the 1MB).

All lending is fractional reserve. 
At the times where gold was money, you could deposit your gold into a bank and pay the fee for have it stored. And it was kept there and not moved. This way it was always available to you and you could always withdraw it. Today you can use safe box in a bank.
Or you could deposit it and let them lend it. But it was no longer non-fractional, if everybody wanted to get their deposit, it wouldn't be possible. The money starts to multiply,  the person who borrowed the money could buy equipment for his business and the seller of the equipment can deposit the money in the same bank and have it also lend. And suddenly the same gold creates two deposits. And unwinding it requires both borrowers to return their money. So lending creates money and paying debt destroys money.

Two first positions on your list are contradictory. Because either you pay high transactions fees or you have slow processing times. You cannot have both. 
Slow technical advancement, you say? We have has a major change with segwit, there are sidechannels and lightning network being developed. So larger blocks are a technical advancements, in your opinion?
Forks coming every week is not a Bitcoin problem. You can safely ignore them. No harm done. 
Bitcoin is less centralized than in 2013. The mining pools are more diverse (though China still dominates) and there are more full nodes in the network.   
The only true on your list is that microtransactions are indeed impossible but no altcoin can do the same with the popularity of Bitcoin (Ether has had a huge growth of unconfirmed transactions and rising fees due to Cryptokitties). And lightning network is perfectly suited for microtransactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:28:34
Maybe. I don't know if the specification allows for multiroute payments (even if not, you can always make several smaller payments). But nevertheless, you cannot route around the limitation that there are only 21 million BTC. If there are millions of channels, most of them will be small. And paying in LN, you can utilize only bitcoins in your channel path. 
LN is ideally suited for micropayments. It's unlikely that it will be used for even medium size payments.

Although this story is mainly FUD, it is in theory possible to rewind the blockchain before the segwit activation on Aug 1 with a metric megashitton of hashing power and steal all the funds in Segwit addresses that have their public keys exposed (so if you don't reuse addresses, no worry). The operation would cost billions and would crash the value of Bitcoin to the ground (because all the transactions from Aug 1 would be reversed so the chaos would be immense). If it happened, I would not care if I had a legacy bitcoin worth pennies or a stolen segwit bitcoin. 
Edit: Since the whole history up to Aug 1 would be reversed in this apocalyptic scenario, only pre Aug 1 Segwit coins could be stolen. Because all post Aug 1 coins (including post Aug 1 legacy coins) would cease to  exist and the funds would revert to pre Aug 1 owners. There were very few pre Aug 1 segwit coins, some tests were made and some brave developers made such transactions. So even in theory, this plan would not be very successful in stealing segwit coins.

Ledger segwit wallet (so far) uses the so-called P2SH-P2PWKH address type, i.e. segwit embedded in pay-to-script-hash (P2SH). For everybody this address looks like any other P2SH address (starting with 3). Since P2SH standard is very old (BIP16 activated on 2012-02-15), all wallets should support sending to P2SH-P2WPKH.

We are at 30-35% of possible capacity. Segwit and batching adoption by exchanges would allow 3 times the current transaction rate. If they are not bothered to do it when the fees are high, do you think they would be bothered if we increased the size whenever there is a capacity problem?
The storage is not a problem and never actually was. The biggest cost of running the node are upload burst bandwidth, data caps and RAM/CPU requirements. With UTXO creeping up, the RAM would kill any low-end machines soon. Bandwidth increase would kill users with data caps.
I think some modest block size increase is possible but we haven't yet seen the 2MB blocks (full segwit adoption) and don't expect much larger blocks to be possible on consumer machines. My mid-range desktop occasionally chokes now whenever there are a few blocks in short succession (happens daily) and I'm temporarily out of sync with the blockchain. With 8MB blocks, I would probably have to buy a separate machine, with plenty of RAM and SSD instead of HDD.  I have paid maybe $80 in fees this year. Still less than a new machine. 
Also, with bigger blocks we will also either see orphaning again or SPY mining would make more and more empty blocks. And no, BCash has not been tested with 8MB blocks, there were only 4 such blocks, very widely separated.

They were, [see, e.g. here](  Several 1130 satoshi fees = $0.12 at that time. It would have been $0.09 if segwit was used. These are regular transactions because it was the running fee at that time. 
I agree, this was a brief window on Dec 4 with such small fees but 15-20 satoshi/byte (i.e. $0.30-$0.40) were common at that time (Dec 4-5). 
You say, months? I made a transaction with 140 satoshi fee (I wanted to test segwit) in late October. With $5500 BTC at that time, the fee was $0.0075, i.e. less than a cent. Yes, a waited a few days but the running fee was $0.03 without waiting. 
Yes, the fees are a problem. But we have segwit for months and only 10% transactions are segwit. Apparently, fees hurt too little for many to bother.

Bitcoin is not what Satoshi created since 2011. Because Satoshi disappeared in 2010. There were enormous improvements both usability-wise (first encrypted wallets then deterministic wallets, multi signatures, etc.) and under the hood, e.g. enormous optimizations. Original Satoshi's code even after updates couldn't handle more than 500 kB blocks, see the [infamous DB locks incident]( 
Ideas such as LN do not appear out of nowhere. It requires a functioning Bitcoin and real view of the challenges. Satoshi did not predict LN because nobody at that time though it was possible. And it wasn't possible without a few upgrades in Bitcoin, such as OP_CHECKLOCKSEQUENCEVERIFY (and friends) and finally segwit.

Unless you are a miner, you will not send such a transaction. They are all non-standard because the outputs are below the dust limit which is currently 546 satoshis. If you split it into pieces of 546 satoshis, you will pay tons of fees and the resulting outputs will be unspendable because the fees will be larger than the value of the coins. So you will turn you 0.001 BTC + fees into dust.

OK. This is getting interesting. If you wait a bit, I'll try to figure it out in detail.  Or experiment yourself on testnet. 
Indeed Electrum would do that. You have to increase the fee even more but if you bump the fee large enough, you will kill your child transactions like it never happened (it's because the replace by fee bumps the fee from the change and if you change the change, then the transaction that depends on the change becomes invalid).
If you want both transactions to go, you have to bump the fee on the child transaction. They will both confirm if the sum of both fees divided by the sum of both sizes is larger than the market clearing fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:30:19
Yes, you can, though it is not easy. 
You install Electrum and add a hardware wallet (well, this is not difficult). So now you can use Ledger with Electrum (with full functionality of  Electrum, which is much better than Ledger app with the same security of hardware signing). Then you install electrumx server (this is  hard) and connect it to your Bitcoin Core. You set up Electrum to connect to your electrumx server. And the transaction will go Electrum-&gt;electrumx server-&gt;Bitcoin Core-&gt;Bitcoin Network.

The fees got that high due to unprecedented activity on Thursday (due to markets volatility). Now [they are slowly trending down]( with fees 60% off the peek (you can confirm 160 satoshi/byte, while it was 400 sat/byte yesterday). 160 sat/byte is $5.5 for a typical legacy transaction, or $4 for segwit. It's still quite a lot but weekends usually bring less transaction volume and the mempool should ease a bit more, with some luck to 50 sat/byte by Monday. A week ago, the fees were 5 sat/byte (so 10-20 cents) but nobody knows if we return to such small fees. 
Bitcoin transaction fees are independent of the value. It's not worth moving small amounts.

No, but if Schnorr signatures are implemented, it may help (though no miracles, the signatures will be smaller but non-signature part take a few dozen bytes per input and it will not be reduced). I'm not sure but I think Schnorr may only work with segwit so it may not help with the legacy dust.

Definitely. There are very few scenarios where Bitcoin (almost) dies and altcoins thrive. It had to be a very Bitcoin-specific problem and it would also make a significant dent in the altcoins value because if the largest coin can be killed then smaller ones are not immune (even if not to the same problem but to a similar one). On the other hand, Ethereum can die today and Bitcoin would likely not even blink. Because Ethereum has not existed for most of Bitcoin history. 
Altcoins are bull market vehicles. People bet it's going to be "the next best thing". 
Very few of the altcoins bring anything new to the cryptocurrency world. Most of the altcoins are scams anyway. Anything premined can be dumped below your buying price and the preminers would still profit.

Before jumping into the LN relay ship, you should be aware that while paying to in the LN is complete risk free, getting payments is not risk free. If you get payments, you have to monitor the network and if the malicious counter party closes the channel with an old state of the channel (where you have not yet received the funds), you need to broadcast the penalty transaction within some time limit (current default is 144 blocks, so about 1 day). The good news is that it can be automated and left to the network, the penalty transaction penalizes the cheater and you can set up the reward to be spendable by anybody so anybody in the network can broadcast the penalty transaction and receive the reward.

There is zero evidence for a spam attack. Any such attack would have to spam with high fees. Spam with low fees does nothing. The mempools even have memory limits to evict the lowest-paying transactions. 
There is a FUD and media attack by Ver and Co. But they don't have to spam the network. What do you think happens when exchanges open 100,000 BTC accounts daily and some of the users want to withdraw the funds?

It does matter unless he is going to forget the keys and leave the funds unspent. Because eventually, you will have to move the coins and pay the fees. And the size of the transaction is 147 bytes per legacy input. 
On the other hand, he might be waiting for the Schnorr signatures. With the Schnorr signatures, the size of the signature will not depend on the number of inputs.

No, there was only [one 8MB block, two 6MB, two 4MB and three 3MB that day]( widely separated by 2MB blocks. Sure it is busy by Bitcoins standards but this is not something that is not possible with a full segwit adoption (well, except a few larger blocks but there are only a few).

I spent time watching this video. I tried not to biased. I read Rizun's paper arguing that unlimited blocks have limits due to risk of orphaning and I found it quite interesting and challenging my dogma that blocks have to have limits to crate a fee market. But this talk is pure garbage. 
This argument he presents might be valid is a bizarre BCash world where everything is centralized and only miners run nodes and can switch on and off everything. But for Bitcoin, it is pure nonsense.
The main argument is that miners can collude and strip witness signature and pocket extra money. This is a complete misunderstanding both how segwit works and how Bitcoin works. Doing that means reversing the segwit soft fork. And reversing a soft fork is a hard fork (i.e making previously invalid blocks valid). And hard fork is a creation of an altcoin. So yes. miners can do it and create a "rob segwitters off" altcoin, which will be  rejected by honest nodes and ignored. And they will waste money and electricity for the stupid attack that is not going to work. 
If  he is one of the best brain powers that BCash group has then I think we can safely sleep because they are intellectually inferior as a group. They are only good in loud propaganda.

It depends on the transaction size. And the transaction size depends on how many inputs and outputs are and how complicated they are (multisignature inputs are larger). We have maximum 1MB block virtual size (i.e with segwit discount). You can squeeze 1800 transactions (i.e 3tx/s with 1 block per 10 minutes) if they are 555 vbytes each or 6 tx/s if they are half the size. The smallest possible standard transaction is 110 vbytes, so you can have 15 tx/s of these type of transactions. 
And this is the theoretical blockchain speed. You have different block generation speed (they can be faster or slower than 1 per 10 minute) and the transaction can be generated faster or slower. If the transaction are generated faster than the blockchain clearing speed, the mempool increases if there are less new transactions that block confirmations, the mempool clears.

Only confirmed transactions unconditionally exist. Unconfirmed transactions are, well, unconfirmed. 
I have this transaction in my mempool and it shows in btc.com but it depends on an [unconfirmed input with a very low fee]( My theory is that this transaction was removed from many mempools (including those that your Ledger app or Electrum connect to) due to the low fee. When a mempool gets full (but each node sets its own limits), it evicts the lowest-paying transactions. And if there is no parent, the child is also evicted. 
Since the transactions are in some of the mempools, they may eventually be mined. But since a transaction in a block cannot depend on a unconfirmed transaction, the latter cannot confirm without former. And both of them have an average fee of only 98.5 satoshi per byte which is too low now (but it may confirm next weekend, where the number of transaction is likely to be small).
Either wait, or you may try to double spend them (if they are not visible in your wallet, the wallet will allow it) with a larger fee. Double spending is always tricky, some of the nodes may reject your double spending effort. But miners are usually happy to double spend with larger fee. 
And please use "replace by fee" (Electrum has such an option), it helps tremendously in fee bumping.  And use "send to many". Electrum has this option. With send to many you save quite a lot of fees because you do not generate and respend the change. And finally, switch to a segwit wallet. Both Ledger app and Eletrum support segwit. Segwit brings lower effective fees and many other (under the hood) improvements.

But the attacker fares worse. 
Many people bringing up this argument do not realize (or do not want to mention it), that you don't have to monitor the mempool. Only the blockchain. Because the transaction that allows the attacker to rob you must first appear in the blockchain (so if the mempool is clogged, this is the first barrier). You have a key to this address that allows immediate spend and the attacker can only spend after some time. And you can spend his funds on a mining fee. So you are ahead of the attacker time wise and you can use more funds for the fee. There is virtually no scenario (except when you miss the deadline or maybe if the attacker is friends with miners but the miners must really love him because they will get less fees) that the attacker can gain from it. 
Imagine that you (Alice) have 0.3 BTC and Bob has 0.7 BTC in the channel. It means that you have a closing transaction that pays Bob 0.7 BTC immediately and 0.3 BTC to Alice in a conditional address that have two keys. One unlocks it immediately and the other pays you after, say, 144 blocks. You keep only half of the immediate key. The other half  has Bob. Bob has a mirror image of this transaction, it pays Alice 0.3 BTC immediately and 0.7 BTC in a conditional address with two keys, one immediate and one delayed. Bob has only the delayed key and half of the immediate. 
Now imagine that  Bob pays you and you have 0.4 BTC and Bob has 0.6 BTC. But before you sign this new transaction you must receive from Bob the second half of the immediate unlocking key from the previous transaction. You can verify the keys since the public keys are known. And now if Bob tries to broadcast the old transaction and it is mined, you can spend 0.3 BTC that belonged to you and also 0.7 from Bob because you have the immediate key (Bob can spend 0.7 BTC, so it's 0.1 BTC ahead only after delay). So you can sign a new transaction from this address using the penalty key: 0.1 BTC to Alice and 0.6 BTC mining fee. If it is mined, you are even. If Bob tries to make a transaction, he can only pay 0.1 BTC fee to be even (and less if he wants to rob Alice). So miners pick up your transaction instead of Bob's. 
You may ask  how cannot you rob Bob? Because you cannot force Bob to publish the old state. And your old state mirror transaction is completely different and the penalty key does not work. The penalty key only works for the old transaction that Bob owns.

Lightning does not require any Bitcoin protocol upgrade. Everything was done in the past. 
MAST has proposed [BIP114]( and [BIP117]( 
and these are candidates for a softfork. This is particularly easy with segwit where new functionality requires only a new witness version (and of course programmed support for that but this is worked on). Schnorr is less mature but could have the same upgrade path.
Soft forks require support from miners and segwit was nasty but there were many softforks that went smoothly. So it may work this time, too.

I'm not sure I was clear enough. Hodlers cost the Bitcoin ecosystem just a few hundred bytes each and it's not a big problem. But hodlers do not pay fees for keeping the mining active (when the coinbase subsidy is gone), only  transactionistas. Yet, hodlers benefit greatly from the security that mining provides. Now, it is not a problem, we are in the inflation era but when the subsidy is (almost) gone, hodlers will free ride on the transactionistas. 
Sure, one can argue that fresh transactions benefit more from robust mining more than old ones as the reorganizations are more risky for fresh coins but everybody benefits from the stability the mining provides. If the fees are not large enough to keep the difficulty high, we may get mining reorganizations and the resulting chaos. If the difficulty is small, the 51% mining attack is cheap. And if the 51% attack is cheap, somebody with grudge on Bitcoin will do it. Governments, competition, the list of the Bitcoin enemies is long. You cannot really benefit from the 51% attack (that's why it has not happened, yet) but you can create a lot of damage. So hodlers cannot let transactionistas go away, yet the transactionistas may become fed up with the fees and leave to, e.g. altcoins. Or they will create their own Bitcoin inflacoin (as suggested by the OP article), leaving Bitcoin with not enough mining revenue and thus insecure.

There are two aspects in centralization: individual miners centralization (the ones that control the hashing) and the pool centralization (where the blocks construction and validation happens). 
Hashrate is more decentralized than the pools, though most of the hashing is in China. There are big hashing farms but none is nowhere near to controlling the significant fraction of the global hashrate.  
Orphaning create an incentive in pool centralization. Please, [read one of my previous comments](

This is tricky and mostly (but not completely) true. LN channels store funds in multisignature addresses. You have one key, the exchange has the other. Also, you get a signed refund transaction (in case the exchange does not cooperate). If hacker steals the exchange key, he cannot get the channel fund that belongs to you without your cooperation. 
But the hacker can steal the key and pretend that he operates the exchange. Even better if it can controls other channels. It gets bad if he can control the exchange without  the exchange realizing. Like the MtGox hack (nobody knows if it was a hack or an inside job but the effect was the same, silent siphoning of funds). He can move the coins through LN channels to him and nobody will notice. 
So this is not completely hack-proof but the hacker cannot steal the funds you haven't moved to the exchange, yet. But the funds on exchange can be stolen. And it can be nasty if the operation is stealth, without anybody noticing. 
The good thing about LN is that small funds can be moved. So you can sell small amount, withdraw them and lose only small amounts that you have not yet withdrawn.

No, it wasn't. Satoshi's whitepaper mentions the fees. The fees are necessary after the coinbase inflation is gone. Bitcoin was sold by overzealous proponents as free or virtually free but it has never been further from the truth. 


Yes, they can. But there are no barriers of entry. No network effect (competitor to Paypal will start with zero user base, won't be able interoperate with Paypal users, a LN competitor enters an open and interoperable network). 
Moreover, mining is and must be expensive. It's the only way to protect against a 51% attack. There is no other way around it. Early Bitcoin and most of the altcoins simply pay the miners with inflation. But this is not sustainable long term. 
On the other hand, processing LN transactions is cheap and is never going to be expensive. The only non-trivial cost is the cost of capital (both freezing and guarding it). Hence, the per transaction fee will be very small, the per value fee may not necessarily be negligible.

Most of the accelerator services are likely scams. The ones from miners may work (because they can indeed confirm whatever they want if this is a valid transaction) but nowadays the fee is too much of a business so it is likely to be very expensive. 
After some time (14 days is the default expiration in full nodes but this is not uniform), the transaction should drop form the mempools, you should also be able to reset your wallet and resent it with a larger fee. As long as it stay in a mempool, the node will reject a new transactions treating it as a double spend. 
You may try to do it now because at 12 sat/byte it might have been removed from some of the mempools and may propagate to some of the miners that may grab this double spend with a larger fee. I'm not sure if it is going to work. Doing double spends is always tricky. If you can afford to wait, it is best to wait. 
In future, try to migrate to a wallet that allows replace by fee. With replace by fee, it would have been super easy.

Schnorr signatures will be extremely difficult to make retroactively (for old legacy outputs). It's more likely that Schnorr signatures will only be available for segwit. One of the advantages of segwit is that the witness contains version number which can be easily upgraded to mean Schnorr.

These 2FA wallets are very expensive now and not worth it for such small transactions. Firstly, you pay the trusted fee, secondly the size of the transaction is large because of the non-segwit multisignature (406 bytes vs 226 for legacy transaction or 166 bytes segwit). If you had a regular segwit wallet, you would have paid  0.000227 BTC and no trusted fee. 
Edit. [Trusted coin fee is 0.002 BTC for 20 transactions]( and it's not an Electrum fee but the Trustedcoin. So next 19 transactions, you will have no trusted coin fee but the extra size due to multisignature will always be there.

Electrum 3.0+ has a full bech32 wallet and can also send to bech32 addresses. Ledger has support of bech32 in firmware 1.10, after some small hacking I was able to use it with Electrum (for both send and receive). It has an official wallet planned for Q1/18. Trezor either already has bech32 or is in beta, I'm not sure.   
Bitcoin Core [has a full bech32 wallet in the review/testing stage]( but current github HEAD version can already send to bech32 addresses. 
No idea about other wallets but likely not yet. 
If your wallet supports bech32, you can send to everything. The problem is with receiving, you can receive from other bech32-aware wallets but, e.g. no exchanges support bech32 withdrawal as far as I know. 
Adding support for sending to bech32 is much simpler than a bech32 receive wallet, we would see much faster adoption of sending to bech32 next year (hopefully).

There are a handful of altcoins that have anything even remotely different from Bitcoin and even those will not scale (but offers some value in the present state, e.g. Monero). Recently, Ethereum backlog and fees skyrocketed due to a Cryptokitty popularity, so anything will struggle if it's popular.  
Bitcoin is likely in a bubble (but it was continuously in a bubble since 2011 because every time since then you could argue that it should not be worth that much) but the recent altcoins bust  makes it at least partially supported by the fundamentals.

Yes, there was an enormous progress and it also shows that the group of people that advocated block size increase before these optimizations  were irresponsible.
I think a small (2x, maybe even 4x, though this is really pushing the limits because low-end hardware would no longer be able to run full node) increase should not put as in jeopardy and I'm not sure what the Core developers plan is for that. Maybe they want first to "starve the beast". It is extremely disconcerting that even with &gt;$20 fees at the peak (currently well below the peak, though), 90% transactions are non segwit and major exchanges do not batch transactions.  If we increased the blocksize every time there is a problem, they would never optimize their transaction engines. They are the blockchain polluters.

Segwit addresses are perfectly claimable in case of fork. I personally claimed BTG from a segwit address. However, depending on the tools (most forks use a Core clone), it may be more complicated than for the legacy ones. 
It is possible that a clone removes segwit but it would be equivalent to "stealing" from segwit users. Many would think it's not fair and such a fork would likely have smaller value than others.
There is a diminishing value from these forks. They are premined scams anyway. I'm not sure I want to risk anything (at best privacy) to claim anything.

No, sending in LN carries zero counterparty risk. Receiving in a LN channel carries some risk that can be mitigated. 
By sending, you only "risk" opening and closing fees and some funds lock-up. Opening a LN channel is simply a Bitcoin transaction to multi signature address. You keep one key, the other party keeps another but before you do, you receive a refund (closing) transaction from the funded address that pays the balance to yourself. LN transactions are simply updating the closing transaction. If your balance is 100 and you send 10 to Bob, you update the closing transaction from "Pay 100 to yourself and 0 to Bob" to "Pay 90 to yourself and 10 to Bob". The 
closing transaction is time-locked and cannot be spent before some predetermined time in order to let the counterparty publish a penalty transaction if you try to cheat by sending an old channel balance where you have more. If the counterparty cooperates, closing transaction can be updated with no time lock.

We could have 1 sat/byte transactions now if exchanges (and some other large blockchain users)
1. Switched to segwit
2. Started batching transactions
About 90% transactions are non-segwit. About 70% more capacity compared to current 1.1 MB blocks would be possible if users switched to segwit. 
I also ran an analysis of the recent blocks and about 35% of inputs are less than 5 blocks old. It means that up to 35% of blockspace would have been  freed if transactions were batched (because these are not necessary if they were run together as multioutputs). Well, batching it would introduce a small delay and not all the transactions are by the same party (but most are) but 7-11% inputs recently are from within the same block. Batching it  creates zero extra delay.  So about 50-60% of blockspace is wasted. Why? Most businesses don't care. They want to externalize their costs on full node users instead of doing their part. And doing their part would save them millions in fees. But they apparently have so many new users that they would rather profit from them than fix their broken bitcoin transfer engines.

No. Please do not make such claims. It is good to contribute but it is not necessary. There is plenty of nodes to choose from. We are not short of the upload speed. 
The most important purpose of full nodes is to make transactions from full nodes. This way one cannot be duped into accepting a false coin. And the more people verify the blocks they transact on, the less chance anyone would like to pass false coins into light node users.
What kind of "false coins"? For instance an "inflacoin", a coin without the 21 million limit. Currently, the only way to verify that miners had not increased their reward is to run a full node.

It's a difficult choice and it depends on your technical knowledge, willingness to learnm, and safe practices. 
Also, choose wallet that allows you to set up your own fees. All of the mobile wallets I tested (Mycelium, Electrum mobile, ~~Samurai~~) failed it and recommended fees were always way overestimated. 
1. Tiny sums (a few, maybe a few tens of dollars): keep on an exchange. Really, the exchange may go bankrupt but tiny amounts are not worth the effort and the transfer fees. If you buy more or if bitcoin is worth more, by that time you'll learn more and will get a proper wallet. 
2. Small sums: desktop wallet, I recommend Electrum, it allows full control over fees, coin selection and has an excellent replace-by-fee interface. Cons of a desktop wallet: if you get a malware that steals the password, the funds may get stolen. Unfortunately it happens, particularly on Windows. Antivirus helps but no antivirus is 100% safe.  
3. Larger sums, either an airtight (i.e., without any software except for the wallet and no network) desktop for offline signing (Electrum works very well in this case) or a hardware wallet. Both Trezor and Ledger are good. Both can also be used with Electrum for more features with the same security. 
4. With even more sums, set up your full node with the setup up from point 3. Run Bitcoin Core and Electrum Server and connect Electrum to this server. This is not easy but having a full node is the only way to make sure you are not being cheated. It's the essence of Bitcoin, trust only yourself. Light nodes are not completely safe since they do not check if all the coins are valid. They are not safe in case of some malicious network split where light nodes may blindly follow the longest chain. Light nodes have poorer privacy, they only download information about your own coins and  the server you connect to can guess which coins you have. Some wallets try to obfuscate it but it's never as safe as full node.

The definition is simple. Hard fork makes some of the old invalid blocks valid, soft fork makes some of the old valid blocks, invalid. This is commonly described as relaxing and tightening, respectively. 
If I make a rule that difficulty jumps 10 times up starting from the next block, it is a soft fork. Old software would still recognize these blocks as valid. But miners mining with the old rules would make some of the previously valid blocks invalid. If I make the difficulty smaller, it is a hard fork. If I change the coinbase from 12.5 to 10, it is a soft fork (I don't know if you are aware that miners can pay themselves less than 12.5 BTC and it will be a valid block), if I switch from 12.5 to 15, it is a hard fork. Changing 1 MB limit to 10 MB is a hard fork. Switching to 500kB is a soft fork (because you can create a 1 kB block now and it is valid but you can't make a 10MB). And so on.  
If a hard fork tightens some of the rules then it is a combination of a hard fork and a soft fork. Because hard fork must make some of the previously invalid blocks valid.

The channels can be left open indefinitely. I plan to open two channels and never close them.

@_date: 2017-12-23 07:50:01
You can use the old one but the segwit addresses will be separate form the old ones, i.e initially empty. 
Electrum (that can be connected to both Trezor and Ledger) has a "send to many" option. With this option you can send the coin change of the next transaction to the segwit address. This way, you don't have to spend extra fee for moving to the segwit address. The transfer will piggy back on the transaction you were supposed to make, anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:46:18
True. I monitor the mempool myself and the largest 1h average transaction level ever was 2.6 kB/s. 2.6 kB/s is 1560 kB per 10 minute block. It's not even a full segwit block. 
And it's even worse that that. There are several business that do not batch transactions. The businesses prefer to profit from new customers than fix their broken bitcoin transaction engines. Not only they do not have segwit but many exchanges do not batch transactions wasting 80% of space. The best example is Gemini, no segwit, no batching and they use an (obsolete for years) uncompressed public key, [adding 32 bytes extra to each of their 367,872 transactions](
If we increase the blocksize they will never get rid of the bloat. And if we keep the bloat, we will make running the full node prohibitely expensive.

No, the transaction volume went down. 62 satoshi/byte transactions started to clear. A few hours ago 30 MB of transactions were ahead of you. Now it's only 15 MB. If the transaction rate does not increase (big if), it should confirm. But when Americas wake up, the transaction rate usually picks up, I'm afraid.

Well, maybe. But BCH hasn't tested anything, yet. A single 8 MB or two blocks does not make a test. There were only four 8MB BCH blocks, very widely separated
I run a full node and the problem is when there are a 3-4 blocks in short succession. It happens every few hours. When it happens, the node gets a hiccup. It hasn't processed the old one and new ones try to arrive. It gets temporarily out of sync and for instance, Electrum (that I have linked to it) would not show any unconfimed transactions until it syncs again. The machine is a reasonable modern desktop but I use it for other tasks and the blockchain in on HDD. With 8MB blocks, I would likely have to buy a separate machine, possibly with more RAM and SSD and run only Bitcoin on it. I will never pay in bitcoin transaction fees the cost of the machine or probably not even the electricity to run it.

I do not know all the details but the protocol requires updates of the refund fee if the market fee increase. Also, the channel (except initial funding) cannot be imbalanced for one side (there has to be a reserve) so the other party is also motivated to get the refund and should cooperate in the fee bumping. 
But I have no idea what would happen if the other party drops dead and the refund transaction is stuck in a limbo. 
Edit: I realized that if you control the closing refund address (and you should, it would not be a good idea to have refund send to a third party) you can easily do "child pays for parent" and bump the fee. So there is no risk of the transaction being stuck forever. However, there is a risk of paying large fees (but Bitcoin blockchain has the same problem).

Currently with 120 sat/byte transactions clearing, it's about $3 if it is a single coin (192 bytes transaction). 
And with hardware wallet linked to Electrum (where you have a "send to many" option), you can make a free transfer in the next transaction. Simply send the change to your new segwit wallet, instead of back to legacy.

No, it would reduce the fees dramatically (at least initially, with lower fees, the number of transactions would increase). Currently at hourly peak levels, the transactions arrive at 2.6 kB/s (hourly average on my mempool monitor). This week's level is around 2.0 kB/s on average. 2.6 kB/s 1560 kB block per 10 minutes. 2.0 kB/s is 1200 kB per 10 minutes. With 1.7 kB blocks (low segwit estimate), we would have cleared current 192 MB mempool in 384 blocks, i.e less than 3 days. And since 1560 is less than 1700, the backlog would not have reappeared and it would be enough to have 1 satoshi/byte transaction as it was possible last time when the mempool was empty, in [late October](

Did you specified an increased  fee? If you keep the old fee, the old fee will be displayed.

It's even bigger effect because inputs are larger than outputs. 
Legacy sizes is 174 bytes per input and 33 per output +12 (headers, etc.).  So a chain of transactions (B and D are recipients, C and E is change)
is 452 bytes and
is only 291. And the effect is the same. The longer the chain, the bigger the benefits of chaining. For more than 20 recipients the savings are more than 80%.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:42:11
Not completely. A witness program is a special sequence, where OP_0 is only one of the parts.
See, CScript::IsWitnessProgram in script/script.cpp in Bitcoin Core. And calls to this function. 
So you can use OP_0 inside a script without changes as far as I understand (but it will be non-standard). But OP_0 and data between 2 and 42 bytes is a witness program and it has to be accompanied by a witness signature to be valid. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:09:29
It depends on the wallet. Bitcoin Core shows it if you enable "coin control features". Electrum will show it to you if you click preview instead of send (and allows you to fine tune the fee with "edit the fees manually"). Wallets for newbies usually hide this information. 
Typical transaction is 1 input/2 outputs (recipient and change). This is 226 bytes legacy, 166 virtual bytes segwit that starts with 3 ,
or 141 vbytes bech32 segwit. If you have received many transactions, particularly small ones and the funds from one are not large enough, the wallet will combine the inputs and there can be more than one input. Each legacy input is 147 bytes extra, segwit is 91 bytes or 68 (bech32). Outputs are cheaper, 33, 32, and 31, respectively. Therefore, it is very beneficial to combine transactions and instead of n transactions do one transaction to n recipients.
The input bytes may vary by 1 byte. Signatures are not always the same size.

Wait a little bit more. The fees are slowly dropping (they are already 70% off the peak) and your transaction is not very far away from the level that miners are confirming right now. Only 3MB are above your  fee level. With some luck, you should have it confirmed within an hour or two. If not, the weekend is long and the mempool should slowly improve. 
Edit: I was right. The transaction has just confirmed
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:30:15
Because of the [extreme level of transaction activity since Thursday]( The blockchain has limited capacity and everybody competes for the space. 
For a day, the mempool has been slowly clearing, the fees are already 75% off the peak but a $3 fee, assuming a typical non-segwit transaction of 226 bytes and $15000 exchange rate, translates into about 88 satoshi per byte and there are about 20-30 MB of transactions (so 20-30 full blocks assuming no extra activity) above your level so miners will include them before your transactions.  With good luck, it may clear by Sunday evening because during weekend the activity is lower. I you had a segwit wallet, the transaction would have already cleared hours ago. 
If you did replace-by-fee, you can bump the fee easily. If not, there is child-pays-for parent (read my [mini-guide here]( but it is going to cost extra.

LN has indeed payment limits and channel balance limits (it may be lifted in the future but currently it is enforced). Maximum payment is about 0.04 BTC and maximum channel balance is 0.167 BTC. And channels must have a reserve, so Bob can never risk 0 BTC. The reserve is a soft limit, Alice suggests the reserve value in the opening transaction and may suggest a large value if she worries a lot.  Bob may refuse such a large reserve but he cannot force Alice to use smaller reserve than she wants. The reserve works both ways, so Bob cannot also pay Alice too much (it also reduces the risk). 
It is indeed possible that Bob can rob Alice of more than he risks if Alice paid him more than the Bob's reserve amount and depleted Bob's balance to the minimum requirement and later accepted a large payment from Bob. But Bob still has the time-lock disadvantage.  


I don't know the details but protocol allows (or maybe even requires) the fee update. 
With the penalty transaction, you are free to use any fee you want because you have the immediate unlocking key.  Al long as the blockchain market fees are below the channel reserve balance, there is virtually no risk. There is a systemic risk of multiple stale channel posting by huge evil Bob but he will have problems in confirming these stale transactions if there is a fee market pressure (the transactions that earlier both Bob and Alice agreed to will not confirm if the market fees increase).
So there is overall indeed non-zero counterparty risk if you both send and receive funds but it is small and it can be mitigated.   There is zero counterparty risk if you only send funds. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:09:07

What you describe is impossible. Each full node verifies everything. You cannot forge blocks or transactions. You have to send transactions with valid signatures for inputs that are unspent. And blocks with current rules (difficulty, coinbase reward, block size). 
But someone can indeed make a Sybil attack (it's difficult because even one node is enough to see that something is fishy) and isolate you from the network so you will only be connected to evil nodes.   And then you are in an alternative reality Bitcoin. The attacker can, e.g. send you bitcoins only in this fake network and not in real Bitcoin. 
But in order to feed you  with correct blocks, he has to mine them at the current difficulty, i.e. he needs to spend a hashrate of an equivalent of 12.5  BTC per block (actually more because in honest network you can also get fees), i.e. quite a lot. And then 5 blocks more so the transaction is confirmed. And hope that you will not check it otherwise (on any online tool). And unless he has the current Bitcoin hashrate (and not just a fraction), you will notice that blocks are coming surprising slowly (like every few hours). 
There are more attack vectors against light nodes (SPV) because they do not verify validity of everything.

And you are right. Forks are printing money. And it is inflation that allows, say, BCH to have almost zero fees (what would happen without 12.5 coinbase BCH reward?).

No, a 3-hour block rate (hence, estimated hashrate) is not a reliable metric. Mining is stochastic and by luck there can be a 100% jump within 3-hours with no extra mining activity, see [cumulative distribution functions of Poisson distribution]( The probability that the block rate jumps at least 100% within 3 hrs by sheer luck (i.e., 36 blocks in 3 hours, instead of 18) is only 0.01% (so it happens every 2-3 years) but if the hashrate is elevated relative to the difficulty by 30% (due to the increase of genuine mining activity), the probability of at least 36 blocks in 3 hours is 0.92%, so it happens every 2 weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:56:08
Apart from all that, BCash is much less secure. With 7% of the BTC hashrate, it can be 51% mining attacked by any of the 6th largest BTC pools with some hashrate to spare. 
In contrast to BTC, where 51% mining attack is not profitable (it would make the mining equipment pretty much worthless because the BTC price would tank), the BCH crash would not impact BTC negatively at all.

No, it's actually brilliant and I'm glad LN authors understand the economic ramifications. 
In Bitcoin blockchain, the space is scarce, hence the fee is per byte. In LN, the frozen capital is scarce, you can do millions of transactions and processing all of them costs next to nothing but if you deplete the channel by sending a large transaction (i.e. all of the balance goes to one party) it stops working that way and requires rebalancing or new funding, or changing the fees so the reverse operation is cheaper and waiting for the rebalancing. All of that cost money. 
LN is going to be the opposite of Bitcoin blockchain. In the blockchain, the number of transaction is limited but they can be of arbitrary value. In LN, the number of transactions can be arbitrary but their value will be limited. 
LN should be a boon for microtransactions, sending $0.01 with $0.0001 fee and all of that in a trustless way.

I have no experience with blockchain.com. They should not flag it because after confirming it does not matter at all. However, the option is indeed stored in the transaction (in the nSequence field) so an overzealous may still flag it. The correct code should flag it only when unconfirmed, however even then it is harmless, it just means that the transaction can be replaced with a higher fee but any unconfirmed transaction is not final. RBF just makes the change easier.

Very easy. Install Electrum. Connect Ledger (unlock it with PIN and start the Bitcoin application). File/New/Restore. Enter name of the wallet. Click Next. Standard wallet. Use a hardware device. The Ledger should be detected (if not, google how to fix it, it can have many reasons, this is the only problematic moment). Click next. Derivation: default is m/44'/0'/0' (this is the wallet you have now). You can later create a new wallet with m/49'/0'/0' this is segwit (it has addresses starting with 3) which has lower sending fees than legacy and slowly move to the new wallet (but you can still use the legacy for sending). Click Next and that's it. You should see your balance and the transactions. 
Read [background about segwit here](


You don't need for receiving and watching. But you'll need it for sending. All the private keys are on the hardware and Electrum does not know them, only the public addresses. Whenever you want to send something, you will have to confirm it on the Ledger.  
P.S. You have overpaid at least 100% on the new transaction.

You can do CPFP from any wallet. But it's best to have a wallet that offers coin control (i.e., selecting the inputs in the transaction). Otherwise, you may have to send the whole balance and it may be super expensive if you have many coins (i.e. many transactions funded the wallet).

There is no really any pressing need to artificially segwify the coins.  Switching to a new segwit receiving address would do the trick.

I find the best combination is to use [this site]( and [this site]( You have to get used to it but it's not difficult. Each block is max 1MB virtual size (virtual means with segwit discount). So miners include the best 1MB of transactions (with some caveats). From the first site you can see the evolotion of the mempool and read (as of 11:50 UT) that 10 sat/byte (3.38 MB) will be not enough if the block is found right now and 20 sat/byte (0.332 MB) is will get confirmed right now. From the second site, you can read that there is a big wall at 11 sat/byte so, in fact, 12 sat/byte should be enough.
But mining is stochastic and there can be a long spell with no blocks or there can be a few blocks one by one. In the former case, even 50 sat/byte might be not enough, while in the latter, maybe 9 sat/byte clears. 
It's best to aim low and have a wallet that allows replace-by-fee.

It's subtle. My full node on a reasonably modern desktop machine with blockchain on HDD chokes occasionally on a series of blocks with short duration. It happens daily that you have 2-3 blocks with very short sequence. Before fully validating a block, another arrives and you are out of sync. If you wait a bit, everything goes back to normal. If you increased the blocksize (probably with full segwit adoption already, though segwit decreases time for signature verification), it would be much more frequent. I would have to create a separate machine and not share it as desktop. With 8MB blocks, I would have to buy a powerful machine with more RAM and replace HDD with SDD and pay more for electricity than I pay in bitcoin fees. And I'm not sure my home internet would handle the bandwidth during peak times. 
But we can increase the throughput probably 3 times without any changes in Bitcoin if [exchanges implemented segwit and transaction batching]( If they don't want to do it when fees are high, imagine how slow they would be, if we increased the blocksize anytime they wanted.

I don't know the Trezor application. I know Electrum (you can link your Trezor in Electrum so you can still have the same wallet and the same security but Electrum interface) and it will show everything. And Electrum has a replace by fee interface that allows fee bumping and many other features.  
Suggested fees are almost always overestimated (the people are less angry with overpaying than with transactions that did not confirm) and it's more frugal to select custom fee.  
If you just received bitcoins in your Trezor in only a single transaction and you are not sending the full balance (so you'll get a change), the size will be 166 vbytes (to segwit addres) or 167 vbytes (to legacy). And if you really have a segwit wallet (you received with an address that starts with 3). If you received bitcoins in more transactions, it gets more complicated.  
Current fee for immediate block inclusion is about 380-400 sat/byte  but 141 sat/byte (its best not to select round numbers because a lot of people select round 140) has a very good chance of confirming within a few hours. Lower fees are possible next weekend (during weekend there is usually less transaction volume).

This is a very broad question. Because there are very many aspects of Bitcoin. I can start with easiest ones.
1. Can you lose money on Bitcoin? Yes, a lot. It happened many times in the history of Bitcoin. It can happen again. Bitcoin always recovered but each time the recovery was longer. There might not be the next recovery for multiple reasons. But Bitcoin has never had a breach in the protocol (well, almost, early Bitcoin fail from an integer overflow bug which was fixed and reversed) and has an excellent track record of surviving many, many mishaps in the Bitcoin ecosystem (hacks, exchange collapses, etc.). Keeping money in exchanges is much more risky than the bitcoin itself. But past performance is not a guarantee of future.
2. Can Bitcoin be surpassed by a better technology? Maybe. It's one of the main risks. However, Bitcoin is not static. It improves, it's much better than the Bitcoin of Satoshi (Bitcoin creator). Recently, Segwit has been introduced which enables many things that were impossible or difficult in the past. 
3. Bitcoin is and must be expensive to mine (it's a feature, it's the only reason Bitcoin was not mining attacked in the past), hence transactions in the blockchain will never be cheap (second-layer solutions may change the situation). 
4. Bitcoin can be killed by someone with very deep pockets. The beauty of Bitcoin is that it is close to impossible to gain by breaking the rules (if miners decided, e.g,  to award themselves more coins, their coins will be rejected by users and worthless). But it is possible to wreck havoc in the Bitcoin ecosystem. With &gt;50% of mining power, it is possible to rewrite Bitcoin transaction history and, therefore,  create an ungodly mess. It is expensive but possible. The attacker would gain nothing but can create chaos. Much cheaper attack is to spread FUD, lies, confusion and recent forks can be considered an  "hybrid" attack on Bitcoin. 
5. Bitcoin is extremely unlikely to die hard but it can revert to a crypto enthusiast playground (with the corresponding loss of bitcoin price) and lose mass adoption if the fad among wide population dies. Crypto enthusiasts love bitcoin due to its decentralized nature, censorship resistance, pseudonymity, and deflationary nature. The general populace may not find value in these properties.

The author of the story doesn't know Bitcoin history. It was certainly possible to mine on a laptop in mid 2010. Difficulty of block 75,000, mined Aug 18 2010 was 511.77. For a 5MH/s miner (typical CPU miner at the time), the average time to mine a 50 BTC block at that difficulty is 5 days. Yes, 5 days! 
Even in early 2011, you could have mined a block if you were a bit lucky (and certainly mined a few BTC in a pool). The difficulty of block 100,000 (nice round number), mined on Dec 29 2010 was 14,484.16. The average 5MH/s block time is 144 days. Of course difficulty increased but with some luck it was possible to mine even then.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:57:04
But segwit transactions are cheaper to verify so one of the negative aspects of larger blocks is significantly reduced. 
I analyzed the last 144 blocks and they would have been 1.88MB on average if fully segwit (excluding empty blocks) with 1.61MB lowest and 2.14 MB highest.

No, soft fork makes some of the previously valid transactions (or blocks) invalid (hence tightening). Hard fork makes the opposite. 
For instance,  [BIP65 soft fork](  redefined OP_NOP2 to mean OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY . Before the soft fork, you could put OP_NOP2 and it would always mean nothing. Since the soft fork, [OP_NOP2 would mark the transaction as invalid if the top stack item is greater than the transaction's nLockTime field]( The soft fork redefined OP_NOP2, making some of the transactions using OP_NOP2 invalid. Previously all transactions containing OP_NOP2 were valid (if they did not violate other rules).

Everything that changes the header, changes the hash. So nonce and, e.g., the merkle root. And merkle root changes if any of the transactions changes. 
Nonce is only 32-bit so miners also modify the coinbase transaction (the one that pays them the mining reward), when the nonce overfills.

Yes, but it's tiny effort. If your mempool has a 300 MB memory limit (default) and you are at the limit and evicted 1-10 satoshi/byte transactions, you won't accept transactions that pay less than 10. You won't validate them. Moreover, your peer nodes are likely not having them, either,  and even if they do, they mark them is "unliked" by you and will not re transmit them.

Nitpicking. I should have added "moved" before coins but it should be obvious from the context.
Edit: but the old coins move very infrequently. So we will never reach 100% segwit adoption but they will never contribute much to the block content.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:19:40


Yet, there are more than 100 blocks since a below 100 sat/byte transactions were confirmed (apart from some parents paid by children). So the average of 4 blocks is, well, wrong. 


These are just words. It's not an algorithm. I cannot reproduce their methodology. I don't know what this 90% means. They do not even explain if they take into account child pays for parent transactions. These sometimes can skew the calculations a lot. 


There is zero evidence for spamming attacks. It all looks genuine. I hate BCash and their shenanigans as much as you and they definitely attack Bitcoin with FUD, the spam is not what they do. The don't need to. What do you think happens when exchanges open 100,000 accounts daily? Crazy transaction volume. 


I'm not talking about the **state** of mempool but the **rate** of mempool activity. I monitor it myself, I have a python script that currently shows me 2.9 kB/s vbytes mempool activity (1 hour average). This is close to all time high. The 1 per 10 minute block clears 1.667 kB/s (with some faster mining 2, occasionally 2.5 kB/s is sometimes possible but it cannot last, 20% more than  1 block per 10 minutes is 1.83 kB/s).  During the last weekend, the mempool rate dropped at times to 1.4 kB/s. When the new transactions come slower than the block clearing rate, the mempool gets smaller, otherwise it piles up. And now it piles up, I'm afraid. 


This was yesterday and today is today. Yesterday 62 sat/byte were confirming. Today, the lowest rate was 110 sat/byte and it's creeping up.

It is working now. I've made a two hop transaction to yalls.org. However, there are few nodes available and those available are not constantly online. And if they are not online, they cannot forward the payment so even with my two channels open, some of the payments cannot go through because no path is available. 
LN requires some network effect to work and it may be a problem initially but with multiple channels open and, therefore, many paths available, the temporary breakdown of some channels should not be a problem.

[Here you are](
You need full node with RPC activated and I think with txindex=1 (I'm not sure about if it will work without it) in bitcoin.conf. And python with python-bitcoinlib (preferably python3). And this is quite slow, so you may reduce the number of blocks to analyze from 144. 
Edit: Fixed the code. Wrong indentation. The old code would crash is the is a block with only coinbase transaction.

Maybe start with [Lightning Network FAQ](
If you want to get technical, [the whitepaper is excellent](
And the strength are: ability of cheap, instant, trustless bitcoin transactions. The main weakness is that the transactions  cannot be large in value. The ability of routing a lightning network transaction greatly diminishes with the increasing value of the transaction. So this is the exact opposite of Bitcoin blockchain, where the transactions can be arbitrary in value but there is a limited number of them possible.  LN has arbitrary number of them but limited value. 
Sending in LN is completely risk free (except for the risk the you send money and the other person will not deliver the goods), receiving has some very low risk that can be greatly mitigated (it is practically risk free if the Bitcoin blockchain has lower fees than the LN channel minimum reserve). LN if used for routing payments requires your private keys to be hot, i.e. not in cold storage so some risk of getting the funds stolen by hackers. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:45:12
This guy is trolling. Ideas never materialize instantly. A lot of work was needed to make it happen, only in August Segwit, which was necessary for Lightning Network (LN), was activated.  LN **is** working currently on testnet, it's not vaporware, although it is a bit buggy (the biggest problem I found in the lnd implementation is that reconnecting after partner shuts down is not perfect and you start to lose connections after a while). It will get worked out, it's much less buggy that it was a few weeks ago. 
Of course it does not mean that LN will quickly become "the next best thing". The biggest problem will be inertia. Look how slowly Segwit is getting adopted by users. And it will take time for LN adoption to grow large enough and since you can't send bitcoin via LN to somebody who is not LN participant, there has to be some level of adoption before it gets usable. 
Nobody knows how LN fees will settle but we can predict that fees per transaction will be very small since processing transaction is very cheap computationally (in contrast to blockchain mining). On the other hand, freezing bitcoins in the channels incurs some opportunity costs, therefore in LN there will be a fee per transaction value. These may not be negligible for larger transactions and may approach the regular Bitcoin fees for large enough transactions. So you will probably be able to send $0.01 with a $0.0001 fee but sending $1000 will perhaps cost $1. 
Transactions will usually take seconds, the biggest delay is communication around the world. There might be some delays with unreliable channels, if one machine on the payment route dies, it will need to be routed around. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:09:14
Who knows. Everything is Bitcoin is glacial speed (which is not bad in itself). Segwit is very easy to setup and it's still only slightly above 10% of the transactions. On the other hand the gains from segwit are not dramatic. Lightning Network should be significantly faster and cheaper. 
A payment processor, such as Bitpay could gain a lot from LN. So if something like that opens, the adoption should skyrocket.  
Keep in mind that LN will only be good for microtransactions (at least the first edition of LN). You won't be able to send 1 BTC through LN or probably even 0.1 BTC, the channels will not be large enough. But for 10000 satoshi  or maybe even 5, it will be great. The protocol supports milisatoshis so maybe even less. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:53:47


Two problems. 1) It is a hard fork so everybody has to upgrade. It cannot be done quickly. 2) We are utilizing 10% of segwit and many exchanges are not even batching transactions, creating a lot of bloat. If users are not optimizing the transactions when fees are high, how can we expect them to reduce the bloat when fees are low? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:30:07
If there are tens of millions of channels (it's a big if, though), then yes. Because each channel can process a few transactions per seconds if nodes are geographically close and maybe 1 per second if far away. But since this is perfectly decentralized, everything can go in parallel. And a LN transactions is a series of a few exchanges of short data between the nodes that essentially mean "update from 100 to Alice and 100 to Bob to 90 to Alice and 110 to Bob". 
But this is really nothing special. It's like saying that cash can handle millions of transactions per second. Because indeed it can, because each transaction is independent. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:23:53
I looked at the [BIP](  and [the Core source code]( 
And the logic is the following: The new fee must be at least the sum of the fee of the parent and all children plus the size of the replaced transactions * 1 satoshi/byte. 
If you had 0.1 mBTC parent fee and 0.2 mBTC child fee and your changed transaction is 200 bytes, the new fee must be at least 0.302 mBTC. 
The child transaction is automatically invalid if the replaced first one confirms. It is unlikely (but not impossible) that the original one (with the lower fee) goes through, then the child transaction is valid and may also confirm. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:51:08
Double spending unconfirmed transactions is quite possible and happens from time to time, though unless RBFed, your wallet or your peers may not want to cooperate. Only one of these will get confirmed (baring second paragraph).
Double spending confirmed transactions is possible during block reorganizations. Since the probability of long reorganizations quickly decreases with the number of confirmations, one confirmation is not very safe, while 6 are almost certain. There we some incidents in the past where even longer confirmations were reversed, though.

You need to define "working". It is working in a sense that code that works exists, you can send a LN payment today. Though there are some bugs that need to be fixed (the biggest problem I noticed is that connections die and have a hard time to reappear automatically). 
The biggest problem is when you are going to do something useful with that. If a simple change to segwit wallets take months to be adopted by exchanges (and we are very far from full adoption), how quickly do you think LN will get embraced by businesses?

The signatures are not stripped. They are present. 
Segwit allows for larger blocks because it introduces weight. And witness has weight one each legacy byte has weight 4.

Depends on the transaction. A typical transaction of one input, two outputs is 226 bytes legacy, 166 vbytes P2SH-P2WPKH segwit (27% less), 141 vbytes pure bech32 P2WPKH segwit (38% less).
If you have many inputs, the savings are larger (and less for many outputs). For 10 input, 1 output legacy is 1515 bytes, 953 vbytes P2SH-P2WPKH (37% less), and 722 vbytes P2WPKH (52% less).
Multisignature transactions benefit even more. Multiinput 2 of 3 multisignature transactions in bech32 P2WPKH segwit are 75% smaller.

I do not understand. Did you do child pays for parent or replace by fee? If you do a new transaction (so, e.g. child pays for parent) you only have to pay at least 1 satoshi per byte. In the RBF case, you have to **increase** the fee by at least 1 satoshi per byte. If you don't, the nodes will reject it.

It won't. Anyone can create a hub. Me, you and a big exchange. And you can switch if any of the hubs plays dirty. It's not like a PayPal lockup where a competitor won't be able to pay current PayPal users. In LN, each new player can route payments to anybody on LN.

There is no problem with  getting mined. Because the outputs of this transaction are time locked. You don't have to monitor the mempool (this is even impossible). You just need to monitor the blockchain. And if  is mined, you can send the penalty transaction. You can put an enormous fee (complete balance of the the cheater) so it will be almost certainly mined and even if there is a backlog (so the timelock passes), the cheater would not be able to match this fee because he will not be able to pay more than you because he couldn't spend more than his balance.

We could likely [have 3 times the current capacity if exchanges and business fixed their transactions engines]( 
I believe we will have the blocks larger eventually but without fixing the bloat, the blocks will be filled very quickly again we are back at square one.
Raising the blocks size has three major problems:
1. It requires a hard fork and hard forks are risky. 
2. The larger the blocks, the more costly it is to run a full node. We have still some breathing room but the full node must be able to be run on a home computer with home internet connection. Otherwise, Bitcoin will become dominated by businesses that could afford running servers and business have different priorities than individual users. This is a speculation but business will likely lobby for permanent inflation. Because inflation would make the transactions cheaper, while it is bad for hodlers. 
3. With larger blocks, small miners are in disadvantage. With larger blocks, there is more risk of block orphaning and small miners are more susceptible to orphaning. This would make larger miners more profitable and small pools would lose miners to larger ones. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:52:22
OK. I hope I'll make it simple. 
Each transaction is Bitcoin spends some coins (outputs from previous transactions) and creates new coins (new outputs). If you only received a transaction once  (or consolidated coins at some point in the past), you have only one coin, one input to a transaction. It is a most common situation (but people that received many transactions may have many coins).
Let's say you have 1 BTC as a one coin. Now if you want to transfer 0.1 BTC to somebody (exchange, business, friend), let's called it A, with a fee of 0.001 BTC, your wallet does a transaction "spend 1 BTC and pay 0.1 to A, 0.001 to miner and 0.899 BTC to address C that belongs to the originating wallet". C is a change. Every transaction either moves the complete balance or creates a change. Normally, the change is created automatically. The change can be later spent in another transaction. With "send to many", you can make the transaction that moves the change somewhere else. So with "send to many", you can do a transaction "spend 1 BTC and pay 0.1 to A, 0.001 to miner and 0.899 BTC to address S that belongs to the new segwit wallet". After the transaction, you will no longer have a coin in the legacy wallet and you will have 0.899 BTC is the new segwit wallet. And this is all without any extra fee, the transaction size is exactly the same with creating change and moving to address S (actually it is 1 byte smaller but this is a tiny difference). And later transactions from the segwit wallet are smaller, hence cheaper. 
Of course, things can complicated if you have many coins. Then you may either wait for another transaction to spend them or consolidate them but the latter increases the size of the transaction so it is no longer free. It's bad if you have many very small coins as each legacy coin (input) is 147 bytes extra in a transaction so it is quite a lot. In this case, I would recommend waiting for fees to get smaller (weekend, particularly longer weekend like Christmas have lower fees, the fees has already dropped 65% from the peak and we should see even lower later) and move them to the segwit wallet.

Only after they stop the bloat we can think about increasing the block size. Because otherwise, they will never fix it and will lobby for larger and larger block size.

I know that HitBTC has both segwit and batching. Also Bitstamp has segwit (and likely batching). 
Both Trezor and Ledger very quickly added segwit to their hardware wallets so these are also companies that are recommended.

No, it wasn't. Satoshi's whitepaper mentions the fees. The fees are necessary after the coinbase inflation is gone. Bitcoin was sold by overzealous proponents as free or virtually free but it has never been further from the truth. 


Yes, they can. But there are no barriers of entry. No network effect (competitor to Paypal will start with zero user base, won't be able interoperate with Paypal users, a LN competitor enters an open and interoperable network). 
Moreover, mining is and must be expensive. It's the only way to protect against a 51% attack. There is no other way around it. Early Bitcoin and most of the altcoins simply pay the miners with inflation. But this is not sustainable long term. 
On the other hand, processing LN transactions is cheap and is never going to be expensive. The only non-trivial cost is the cost of capital (both freezing and guarding it). Hence, the per transaction fee will be very small, the per value fee may not necessarily be negligible.

Bitcoin is also complicated. Hellishly complicated. The more deeply you dig, the more layers of complication you can see. And yet it works. And it took years for bitcoin to mature. And there were bugs along the way. 
I don't know if LN will take off. Just like in 2009 you couldn't know it about Bitcoin. But LN (trustless payment channels) is as ground breaking idea as Bitcoin itself.  And ground breaking ideas are risky.  We know the Bitcoin succeeded but at that time it was pure speculation. 
I don't worry if LN works, I only worry if it hits large enough adoption. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:17:58
LN will be neither. Neither you will have to open a channel to every counterparty, not it is going to be centralized. It will likely be a hub and spoke system. You connect to a hub or a few hubs (but there will be hundreds of them) and the hubs connect to each other and other users. And no, this is not like banking because banking requires trust. And LN is trustless. At no time a hub can grab your money. Uncle Sam can close the hub and you can still recover the funds. If some hubs require KYC/AML, other hubs in non-retarded countries will not. 
This only thing you risk in LN with sending money (there is some risk for receiving but it can be mitigated) are opening/closing  fees and some lock-up time (the funds cannot be spend immediately if the counterparty does not operate).

Do you use a segwit wallet? If no, stop complaining and use one. Do you only transact [with businesses that use segwit and batch transactions]( If no, stop complaining because you are contributing to the problem and switch to businesses that are not "polluting" the blockchain with their bloat. Only if you answer "yes" to both, you can start complaining and maybe educate those that answer "no". 
Segwit and batching allows the blockchain to process 3 times more transactions. We have a scaling solution under our fingertips. And yet, users do not care and businesses prefer profiting form new users than fixing their broken bitcoin transaction engines. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:43:15
1. Channels can be opened indefinitely (but if you only send and not receive, it will be depleted at some point)
2. There is no LN blockchain. The transactions are stored between the channel parties. The network knows only the channel balance (because it is required for routing).
3. The transactions in LN are actually Bitcoin channel closing transactions. The parties simply update from "give Alice 100 and Bob 200" to "give Alice 150 and Bob 150" after Bob pays Alice 50. 
3. If the parties agree, at any time they can close the channel by publishing the last state. You can also close the channel unilaterally but the funds are timelocked (current default is 144 blocks if I remember correctly) so the other party can check if you are not being cheated by publishing an old state where you have more. If so, they can send a penalty transaction (that is signed before by both) that penalized the cheater. 
LN is best suited for micro transactions. You can have an arbitrary large number of transactions but they can be of limited value only. This principle is the exact opposite to Bitcoin blockchain, where the number of transactions is limited but they can be arbitrary large.
The difference to services, where you deposit funds is that you don't have to trust the recipient. The only thing that you risk are opening/closing of the channel transaction fees and in case of uncooperative counterparty, you have to wait for the timelock to expire if you close the channel unilaterally.
If you receive funds, there some risk but with the penalty transactions (that you can actually broadcast with anybody can spend so the network can look for the cheaters and get the reward) the risk is not large.

If they are in different places, there is no way to combine them (particularly if you do not control the keys).
Legacy can send to both legacy and segwit (that starts with 3) and segwit can sent to both legacy and segwit. Segwit discount works when sending from segwit so it is beneficial to have a segwit wallet. 
legacy -&gt; legacy (no discount)
legacy -&gt; segwit (no discount)
segwit -&gt; legacy (discount)
segwit -&gt; segwit (discount).
If you have a wallet that supports bech32 (there are very few, only Electrum and beta Bitcoin Core as far as I know), you can send to legacy, segwit and bech32 segwit, while you can receive only from wallets that understand bech32.  Bech32 addresses give slightly larger segwit discount but are currently not very convenient due to not widespread support. But eventually, people will switch to bech32.

Today's lowest fee for confirmation was around 350 sat/byte (right now about 440-450). Yesterday it was 110 sat/byte, on Sunday 62 sat/byte. It it hasn't confirmed since last week and you had fees larger than that, you are doing something wrong (e.g. sending unconfirmed funds from ultra low-fee transactions). It's an auction and if you do not bid high enough, you are not going to buy space in the blockchain. 
I wish the fees were smaller but 90% users do not use segwit, many exchanges do not batch transaction (wasting even 80% of the space) and do not use segwit. Apparently fees are still too low for them to care.

You may also consider waiting. 58 satoshi per byte is not a very bad fee, though too small right now (80 would have been enough a few hours ago) and if you are not in a rush it may confirm this week. 
You should never assume that this transaction will never confirm (despite what people or your wallet may say). Bitcoin transactions have no hard expire limit. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:06:57
Not really. It's best to think about Bitcoin transactions as non-cancellable. A transaction may be forgotten if it's in the mempool for very long but there is no guarantee. 
Transaction is simply a instruction "move coins from xx to yy". You sent it it to a few servers and those broadcast it all over the world. There is no procedure of removing it because you will never know if everybody removed it.
You can do a "double spend". Send the same coins somewhere else but it is not easy. Your wallet will not let you do it, even if you used other tools, network will likely not accept it. 
If the transaction  fee was not very low (say below 100 satoshi/byte) it may confirm this weekend if the number of transaction eases a bit (it usually happens during weekends but with high volatility on the markets it's not guaranteed).  
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:12:19
All channels have a reserve fund. You cannot go below the reserve. The penalty transactions spend the reserve from the cheater but the rest is paid  to the honest party. So the reward is not paid by you but by the cheater. 
So yes, the cheater maybe can get the reward but it is nothing more than getting the cheat reversed (minus fees). And cheating works only if there is no penalty transaction, so the strategy of cheating and reversing the cheat just in case is risky. Anybody can get the reward 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:47:52
If you do comparisons, take into account various differences. For instance, Ethereum has no multi output transactions (sure, you can create a smart contract with such an effect but nobody does that). So a 100-output Bitcoin transaction would be 100 transactions in Ethereum. 
Also, Ethereum has a lot higher inflation that Bitcoin 15% vs 4% so mining is much more supported by hodlers than in case of Bitcoin. 
I haven't personally tried but I read that Ethereum full node software cannot be run on low-end consumer hardware anymore.

Yes, it can but in LN, you won't be able to move large sums. And even if you could, the fees would be large, comparable with blockchain. Because in LN, processing a transaction is cheap, freezing the capital costs money. It's opposite to blockchain where the number of transaction is limited but their value is arbitrary.

Yes, you can use Ledger with Electrum. Electrum is a much more versatile wallet. It has "send to many", "replace by fee" and coin control, all highly recommended in the world of high fees. 
Ledger still signs the transactions and no keys (except public keys but this is required to get addresses) are read by Electrum. 
To add Ledger to Electrum, create a new wallet, specify "I have a hardware wallet", select "m/49'/0'/0" derivation for segwit (44 is for legacy but you don't want that) and that's it. You can even use them side by side. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:56:20
I don't know if it is a solution for you but both Electrum and Bitcoin Core has "send to many" functionality if you can import your private keys. Each extra output is only 33 bytes, much smaller than a whole extra transaction of 166 vbytes (segwit) or 226 (legacy) so indeed you can save a lot.  
1 input/4 outputs (3 recipients and change) is 291 bytes legacy or 240 vbytes segwit. 33 bytes less if you have no change. It will be larger if you have many inputs. 
Both also allow for replace by fee in case you need to bump the fee. 
The fees are not as large as you suggest (550 satoshi per byte are confirming within one block) but it is going to be $23-28 at the moment with the set of three recipients and change.

LN utility will become smaller and smaller the larger and larger the transaction value becomes because there indeed might not be any paths for a large transaction.  The fees may also become comparable with blockchain fees for large transactions. The protocol designers even restricted the channel size to 0.16 BTC (exactly 2^24 satoshis) (at least in the current version, it may be lifted in the future). But on the other hand the protocol supports milisatoshis and LN should shine for micropayments.

My position is (and from what I read, this is close to many Core developers)
1. we do not need it right now because segwit is already a 2x effective increase. There is also a lot of bloat (e.g. [non-batched transactions](
2. it has to be done carefully. S2X btc1 fiasco showed what could have happened with an ill prepared hard fork.  
3. we must always preserve decentralization at all costs. It should be always possible to run full node an a home-class computer with home-class internet connection. Otherwise, Bitcoin will be captured by business. And the next step of "transactionistas" will be to lobby for permanent inflation. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:15:47

The tail emission might have been OK if designed from the start but now it it would have been a change in the rules. Moreover, nobody knows how many bitcoins are lost. Sure, there were a lot of lost early on but now it is definitely way less than 210,000 BTC a year that the "mild 1% inflationistas" would suggest. 
What would happen when the block subsidy is gone is a serious economic problem. It's not discussed by big blockers (for big blocks the fees would be smaller than for small blocks because the blocks space will not longer be scarce and the minimum fee for the inclusion can be tiny). I found also [a discussion from 2011]( where it was suggested that fees will either be high (not competitive with mainstream banking), or the security mining provides will be laughable.

Current version of the protocol, [limits the size of the channel to 2^24 satoshi = 0.1677 BTC]( 
I'm pretty sure that there will be "large channelers" to complain about it from day one. 
The problem, [as nicely argued here]( is that Bitcoin is limited by block size and cannot handle too many transactions but the transactions can be arbitrary large.  LN, on the other hand, can handle arbitrary number of transactions but is limited by the BTC funds committed to LN so the transactions cannot be large. 
Also, LN has fees per transactions AND fees per value of the transactions which is logical. You freeze 0.1 BTC in the channel and a 0.1 BTC transaction will make this channel inoperative (at least one way) so you want a larger fee than for a 100 satoshi transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:14:20
Batching saves about 80% of size in the outgoing transactions (by not producing change over and over). But segwit saves 40-60% of the receiving addresses consolidation (or the size of the inputs if there is no consolidation). They are both complementary. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:32:57
Network is not slow. It's just higher paying transactions are getting ahead of you. 
If you set replace-by-fee, it is easy to bump the fee (but I guess you haven't done it or you wouldn't ask that). You can try child pays for parent, read [my mini-guide here]( But it's going to be super expensive today. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:24:44


Yes. And why segregation? So the transaction ID (TXID) does not depend on the signature. Signature is separate from the part of the transaction that is hashed into TXID. 
TXID dependence on the signature was one of the major Satoshi's Bitcoin design errors. Since signature is not unique, you can have many valid TXID for the same transaction, hence malleability. Segwit fixes that once and for all. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:31:45
I would not hold my breath yet. This is still very much beta and extremely immature. I have taken my time to set up the lightning network and I couldn't send a payment to anybody, except to myself. The routing path cannot be found or the intermediate nodes die and don't forward the payment. 
Even after bug fixing and going live, it will take a lot of time to gain traction. There must be a certain network effect to be usable. Sure you can create a channel with your friend but then what? It's a nice piece of technology but it's not going to revolutionize Bitcoin tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:51:54
Well, yes. First, you should check the [current state of the mempool]( and select the fee in satoshi per byte. The band with &lt;1MB size should confirm soon (immediately with a block at this moment, later if there is a long stretch between blocks). If you zoom out you can see historical levels.  
Now, a good wallet should give you size of the transaction in virtual bytes (this is the size with segwit discount), so just multiply the size with fee per byte and you get fee is satoshis. Divide by 10^8 to get BTC.
Example. The fee you plan to send 120 sat/byte. Transaction is 166 bytes:
Fee=166*120/10^8 = 0.0001992 BTC=0.1992 mBTC.
Now, if your wallet does not show you the size but at least present you with the number if inputs and outputs, the calculations for segwit addresses that start with 3 (there is another more efficient bech32 standard with addresses that start with bc but this is not very common)
Base transaction (1 input/1 output) is 134 vbytes. 
An extra input is 91 vbytes and extra output is 32 to segwit address and 33 to legacy. (There can be some one of two bytes differences due to rounding and due to signature not being always the same size).  So a typical transaction of 1 input/2 outputs (sender and change) is 166 bytes.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:33:52
No it won't. Hard forks relax rules and soft forks tighten them. It would be a soft fork. 
We could simply add to the Core that starting from block xxxx, transactions to legacy addresses (spending from will be unaffected so no loss of funds) are invalid but it would be extremely controversial. 
However, we can make them simply non-standard, so miners can include them in a block but they will not be relayed and effectively very difficult to make. It would not even be a soft fork. It would be a "default rules change". However, old non-upgraded nodes would relay these transactions.  
On the other hand, super-high fees we have now should do the same trick.

Read my [description how to do child-pays-for-parent]( but with the current market situation it is going to be expensive. 
You can link your Ledger with Electrum and Electrum offers much better coin control. If you have a lot of coins in a wallet (from previous multiple incoming transactions), it's better to send only the change from the stuck transaction, not the whole wallet value. 
I wish more people used wallets with replace-by-fee because fee bumping is then super easy. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:53:16

Even if by some magical force, Core developers added such code to the repository, all the users, miners and merchants would have to change the code, otherwise the Bitcoin will permanently split. So now you can see that it is not possible to do it overnight. If there is ever a hard fork, it will have a long lead time, half a year minimum with months of debates and discussions. 
Now, if ever you ran a full node, you would know that it is not a light task. I run a full node on a desktop computer and it struggles whenever there are  a few quick successive blocks (it happens from time to time because block creation is random). It is already problematic with an average of 1.05 MB blocks. I would probably have to move the node to a separate computer if Segwit adoption is full and blocks are 2MB if I wanted a reliable node. With 8MB, I would stop running a full node because it would be too resource intensive (BCH have 8MB maximum block size but average block size is 50 kB). And this is just a single piece of the problem, there are block propagation issues where small miners are at disadvantage because of the delay between finding a block and propagating it over the network. 
Then we have an [unspent transaction output (UTXO) growth]( This is the most expensive part of Bitcoin, this database should fit into RAM because all the transactions are validated against this set and it grows despite the block size that was not increasing. With Segwit it is going to grow faster and if we increased the block size, we may have not immediate problems but soon  in a year of two the set would grow so much that only fast servers would be able to validate and process Bitcoin transactions. 
And then the peer to peer aspect of Bitcoin, the very essence of its existence would be over. It would be peer to some centralized hub currency. And if hubs do not like you they can ban you from using Bitcoin. And if Bitcoin is no longer decentralized, it all over. And you cannot easily fix it, if it stops being decentralized, it will not revert. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:59:39
The same as between non-segwit wallets. You wait for the inclusion in the block and for further confirmations. 
But segwit transactions have lower effective (virtual) size so you can pay less and still has the same chance of block inclusion. Typical transaction (1 input/2 outpus) is 226 bytes legacy, 166 bytes segwit, or 141 bytes newer segwit (based on bech32 addresses). So if the miners accept 100 sat/byte transactions, you can pay 16600 satoshi for a segwit transaction and are in the same position in the mempool queue as somebody paying 22600 satoshi for a legacy transaction. If you pay 22600 satoshi for a segwit transaction, you are way ahead of legacies paying the same. 
So you pay less for the same priority or pay the same for better priority. But the speed is the same.

Core developers are not against blocksize increase. Quoting Eric Lombozo, [The issue most of the Core devs had was never really about whether we should increase the block size - but how we should do it.
Recent segwit slow adaption is a proof that the market gives damn about fees. It doesn't care. Really. The businesses prefer to profit from new customers than fix their broken bitcoin transaction engines. Not only they do not have segwit but many exchanges do not batch transactions wasting 80% of space. The best example is Gemini, no segwit, no batching and they use a (obsolete for years) uncompressed public key, [adding 32 bytes extra to each of their 367,872 transactions](

If they use a light wallet, they already put a burden on the network. Yes, it's a smaller burden with respect to the data exchanged but a high burden with respect to trust. They increase the size of the Bitcoin economy, where some of the attacks are possible, motivating potential attackers to try it.

Jeez, did you read the Satoshi paper and got this impression? (hint: Satoshi did not expect mining to become so centralized).
Non-mining nodes are absolutely essential to check if miners do not cheat. By either not validating transactions or simply getting more coinbase BTC than they should. 
Now, non-mining nodes that just sit are not that important. But economic non-mining nodes (nodes that create or receive transactions) are essential. This way users, merchants and whoever want to transact keep miners in check. If 51% miners decided, now its great a great time to get 25 BTC instead of 12.5 BTC, they would only create an altcoin that all the current nodes would reject. If all the users blindly trusted miners, they could wake up in a new miners-friendly world and there wouldn't even be an honest chain to go back to. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:02:12


I agree that LTC is obviously superior to BCH but the only thing where it is superior to BTC are fees (due to being less used). Everything else is worse. It has less adoption, the mining hashrate is lower (hence less security with respect to a 51% attack), it has lower block time but this is a mixed bag (there is more orphaning, hence you have to wait for more confirmations to get the same security). LTC has also less developers, shorter history and less public recognition. LTC is a BTC copycat that does not pretend to be better nor being Bitcoin. A younger brother.

It cannot refuse. It can only delay. You have the refund transaction signed. This transaction is valid after some time. There is no way to reverse it after this time passed. 


Well, yes. They will run it to get money from fees. But the fee structure is going to be be completely different. The fees per transaction will be very small and there will be a fee per value. It is quite possible, you will be able to send $0.01 with a $0.0001 fee and $1 with $0.001 fee. Because in LN, updating transactions is very cheap, the frozen capital is more costly. LN will shine for microtransactions. If LN became popular, it would open a completely new web era. You write an interesting post and get a $0.01 tip. You like somebody's post, you tip him. Web sites with no ads supported my micropayments. 


No, because it's trustless. If you deposit money to a bank you have to trust them that they will not steal it that there will not be a run on the bank and that they have enough cash. In LN, the only risk you have are channel opening and closing fees.
If LN takes off (it's an "if" because some network effect is required for LN to become usable), there will be multiple hubs. For profit, non-profit, big hubs with thousands of channels, mini hubs made by a guy with 1 BTC and a dozen of channels. And finally, anybody with two bi-directional channels can route payments.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:14:54
What do you mean by "large channels"? Large value? The transaction size is independent of the value. It's independent on the number of LN transactions exchanged in a channel. I'm not sure if you can close many channels at once but if you do savings are not very large compared to closing channels one by one. So LN opening/closing transactions are never going to be large in size.  Due to segwit magic, they are smaller than current typical regular Joe 226 byte legacy transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:45:54
Well, if they have backlogs to verify users to be able to start profiting from them, broken transaction engines are likely low priority. They should have started the work months ago but they probably  hoped Segwit2X would solve the problem for them (why work in increasing the throughput 2 times when the network will do it for them). 
Users are also at fault. They do not shop for smaller fee exchanges. The ones that have segwit and batching have lower fees. Many have no idea how the fees work, they just want to get a piece of "the next best thing" they heard so much about. 
But no matter what you do, decentralization is costly. Alts are cheap because they haven't hit the limits, yet. And the miners are currently paid by inflation. In Bitcoin, we also pay 12.5, almost a quarter million dollars each 10 minutes in inflation, the fees would have to be a few times larger if there was not coinbase subsidy to support the same mining security.

Hardfork can make for instance the legacy signature hashing linearly scaling instead of quadratically scaling (segwit fixed that but only for segwit transactions). It is a prerequisite to any blocksize increase because otherwise the hashing of large blocks containing the legacy transactions can take a lot of time, effectively DoSing the full nodes.  
Not fixing this was one of the stupidest thing about Segwit2X (the proponents of Segwit2x were either ignorant of that or too technically incompetent to fix it).  
There are other bugs that can be fixed via hard fork: 2015 instead of 2016 window for difficulty adjustment or [OP_CHECKMULTISIG bug]( though the latter would be be hard to chainge without making some of the coins unspendable so it will probably never be fixed.

I don't think this is against the Bitcoin spirit and there are a lot of precedents of such practice. In Bitcoin, unconfirmed transactions have always been second-class citizens.  Any soft-fork (where previously valid rules become invalid) works like that. Aren't you worried about those unconfirmed transactions stored somewhere with e.g. OP_XOR that has been invalidated? Or those  OP_NOP2  transactions that were valid but now fail OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY? These are all very unlikely but what about transactions failing BIP66 (strict DER signature)? And yet we survived all those soft forks. 
You are worrying about a non-problem.   
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:49:35
I disagree with such a stance.  Even if there are such HTLC transactions (which is highly doubtful because there is no software that uses them), they can always be submitted on chain before the hard fork that would have a very long headway. It is wasteful to spend so much collective CPU time for all eternity (of full nodes that are unpaid) for such a non-issue as hypothetical unconfirmed HTLCs, particularly since these HTLCs can be a) submitted to the chain, b) rewritten any time using the new SIGHASH. There is no loss of fund since the unspent outputs will be spendable. 
An ugly solution to all the hypothetical unconfirmed transactions, but better than leaving it as is,  would be to allow legacy SIGHASH only for unspent outputs older than the hard fork date. Since there are finite number of such outputs and this number would only decrease, it leaves a limited option for DoSing the full nodes with the legacy SIGHASH. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:35:15
To be even more pedantic, the pure P2WPKH inputs are one byte larger (if I did not mess the counting), there are 2 extra bytes regardless of the number of inputs and outputs but the P2WPKH outputs are 3 bytes smaller. So for 1/1 transactions, the size is the same, it can be both slightly larger (many inputs) or smaller (many outputs). 
But the P2SH-P2WPKH are always larger due to extra 23 bytes in scriptsig.

Ignoring the fact Bitcoin will almost certainly not switch to PoS (as this is a much less secure way of creating a blockchain), the block time is to synchronize the network (i.e. make sure everybody has the same blockchain) and has very little to do with the PoW computational time. 
One can  create a PoW coin (e.g. Ethereum) with very short block time. It creates a lot of problems, including a high rate of block orphaning. In Bitcoin, [orphaning is extremely rare]( while in [Ethereum it happens every few minutes]( For Ethereum, since the orphaning is so common, one has to wait many more confirmations to be sure one follows the longest chain than in case of Bitcoin. Therefore, the only benefit is the reduced stochasticity. In case of Bitcoin, 6 confirmations can be 60 minutes on average but may be more than 400 in case of bad luck (or 5 minutes in case of good luck) while security-equivalent 240 Ethereum confirmations would take one hour with much smaller variance. 
High rate of orphaning creates an incentive for miner centralization because the larger the miner, the lower rate of orphaning. Ethereum fights it with paying also for the orphans (uncle rewards) which  may only work in an infinitely inflationary environment that Bitcoin consensus will likely never accept.

The fees are dynamic. They were $0.10 just a week ago. It depends how many transactions people make. Crazy market volatility increase the volume. Dull markets and weekends work in the opposite direction. The current fees are $4 for legacy and $2.8 for segwit transactions and are slowly trending down. They might be half of the today's value by the end of the weekend if the current trends continue.  
A few moths ago, a big change called Segwit was introduced which, among other things,  increases the network capacity about 2 times but so far only 10% transactions are segwit and apparently 90% users didn't (yet) bother to upgrade, in particular,  large services like Coinbase. If 90% users switched to segwit the fees would drop significantly because there is not enough traffic that will fill the block with twice the capacity. 
There are other scaling solutions in the pipeline: sidechains, lightning network, Schnorr signatures, and finally, maybe a blocksize increase but it will take some time for these solutions to get mature.

Actually, the transaction rate fluctuates more than the hashrate so the BTC-BCH  hash jumps only add to the noise but is not the major part of the uncertainty. Even with the steady hashrate you never know if your 10 sat/byte transaction in an empty mempool will not be overtaken by a 10MB set of 20 sat/byte transactions sent by a large wallet due to its consolidation. And if it does, your pole position for the next block may become an ETA of 100 blocks or more (if there is a constant 90 kB/minute rate of &gt;10 sat/byte transactions). 
I tested extensively RBF on testnet because it is a bit tricky (the usage depends on the wallet software, Electrum does it quite well, the Core software lacks granularity) and you can bump the fee multiple times (but always up). The minimum bump is 1 satoshi/byte. If the transaction has a change, the bumped fee reduces the change. if there is no change, you can only reduce the sent value (so with no change it not useful for paying someone but wallet consolidation is fine).  I don't have a live "mainnet" experience because all the transactions I sent (with low but not ridiculously low fee) went through within a few hours and no RBF was needed.  
I'm also thinking about programming a fee estimator because I think all the available ones suck in one aspect of another. But I'm not sure I will have enough time to make it public.

I wrote a code to extract the coinbase transactions and here is the first 5000 blocks. 
In gnuplot, you can plot spent and unspent coins with different colors
plot 'file.txt' using 6:($8==0 ? $4 : 1/0) w p title 'unspent','' using 6:($8==1 ? $4 : 1/0) w p title 'spent'
Extranonce larger than 1 byte can be decoded as littleendian and bigendian but it seems it is all littleendian because bigendian does not fit into the fatterns. 
You can zoom in and out. For instance, you can see that at about block 1400 two miners started mining and it suggests that earlier blocks (and later blocks) are not by two similar miners.  
Spend and unspent coins are clearly different, though there are occasional blocks that do not fit into this pattern.

With some moderate luck, this should be confirmed by weekend because during weekends, the transaction rate is smaller and mempool clears. 
If there is large volatility in the markets during weekend, there may be not decrease but increase in transaction traffic and then all bets are off.  
If you own the receiving address, you can also do Child-Pay-for-Parent transaction but it would cost a lot since the original transaction is quite large. 
It's strange than an exchange would set up so small fee.

I agree with the criticism and after reading more I think this hypothesis is not as strong as I thought. However, r/nullc "People claiming "1 million" are claiming that every unspent coin mined in the first year is satoshi's-- which is clearly untrue." is a huge oversimplification. Because 1 million BTC comes from unspent BTC with a distinct extraNonce pattern so it is more than just a count of unspent BTCs from that era. 
There would have to be a combination of a few coincidences for the pattern to appear from multiple actors. Not only very similar hashrate and similar connection time but also unwillingness to spend these coins. Because spent coins have a different extraNonce pattern. 
But yes, the only thing for sure is Satoshi's blocks 0 AND 9. All the rest is a hypothesis. Satoshi may have mined between 100 and about a million BTC or even slightly more.

Apart from accelerators (which are ripoffs, in my opinion), you can do replace-by-fee if your transaction was replaceable in the first place.

If you have, you send the change to the address you own with a fee that is high enough for both parent and child to confirm. Both options are supported by Electrum.

It is not advisable right now to send transactions below 5 sat/byte. Some of the miners do not even include such transactions in the block and there is a very high competitions below 5 sat/byte.

Not really. Look what happened with Bitcoin Clashic (original BCash with original EDA). Old non-upgraded nodes rejected new rules and accepted only blocks with old rules and forwarded them to original network miner(s).  In this network, new BCash does not exist even though it has more PoW. 
Sure, Bitcoin network cannot work without mining but mining cannot exist without P2P nodes. Yes, miners can create their own network but without robust P2P network, a single (apparently) non-upgraded BCash (BClashic) miner would have created blocks that nobody knew about.

Steepness of the sequence of blocks with the increasing extraNonce. 


True but this is much less likely than a single miner because even small differences in CPU speed or starting time would make the pattern disappear. 


Yes, but you are making a lot of assumptions (Ockham's razor would point to a single miner). They would have to have the same hashrate, start mining at the same time and reset the extraNonce at the same time. 
But yes, blocks 1-9 might have been mined by more than one miner if they had almost identical hashrate and started at the same time. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:29:38
It does not matter which chain is the longest if the longer one is not according to the network rules. 
Imagine that Bitmain decides that 12.5 is too little and from now one they mine 25 BTC. Even with 51% of mining hashrate, their blocks will be rejected by all the users and all the merchants. Their fork will become an alt coin.
In the Bitcoin ecosystem, users cannot have their transactions confirmed without miners. But without users who run the nodes and accept them, the miners cointabase transactions  are worthless.  
BClashic definitely can survive as long as there are people willing to trade it and miners to mine it.  And the total PoW does not matter.

But only sending from a segwit address is a segwit transaction (it can be sent to a legacy address and it is still a segwit transaction) and all exchanges can sent to a P2SH-P2WPKH address (starting with 3 but not all addresses that start with 3 are segwit) so it really does not matter for you. But of course it is nice to support exchanges that reduce the congestion. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:44:49
Is there a nice way of creating P2SH-P2WPKH software wallet? The only way I figured out is to select "BIP39 seed" and m/49'/0'/0'  instead of  m/44'/0'/0'. But it requires specifying manually the BIP39 seed (so use some external source of words) and Electrum developers are not fond of BIP39 and warn about lack of support in the future. 
Bech32 addresses are not supported by others yet, so the only reasonable way of using segwit now is to use P2SH-P2WPKH.

Because blockchain.info is broken and does not show the true values. Here is a [correct graph]( Both unconfirmed transactions and total fees are falling.

Lightning network is not yet ready for mainnet but you can try it on testnet. When ready and widely deployed, it should be usable for coffee. You will need to load the channel with bitcoins and can perform as many instant transaction as you like. There will be fees but since there is no limited space in the LN, the transaction fees will be much lower. LN defines milisatoshis so the authors expect some values transferred to be at subsatoshi levels. 
The biggest potential problem with LN is that it binds the capital, you have to freeze the bitcoins and therefore cannot have too many channels open but for a typical user one or two channels to a well-connected "hub" should be enough.  
Segwit transactions are cheaper because the are effectively smaller in size (actually, the signature witness is discounted which lowers virtual size but the effect is the same). Typical transaction of 1 input and 2 outputs is 226 bytes but only 166 virtual bytes with P2SH-P2WPKH (27% discount) and only 141 bytes pure P2WPKH (38% less). Transaction with very many inputs and not very many outputs are about 50% smaller and complicated multisignature transactions are about 60% smaller.  
If everybody switched to segwit addresses, 1.7-1.9 MB blocks would be typical so it will help with scaling. 
Segwit transactions are from a segwit address so in order to take advantage of it, you have to move bitcoins to a segwit address. But you can do it when the mempool is empty and the fees are low (and set up you own fees). You can monitor the mempool [here]
( Weekend are usually better (but not always, two weeks ago, the miners switched to BCash temporarily and the mempool backlog was enormous).

They have to spend a lot of money because spreading lies is much more expensive than the truth. 
The best weapon against BCash is to spread the truth. And it can be a grassroots effort, no need to use a fund. Educate newbies, help them setting wallets. Promote Segwit. Promote replace-by-fee. Promote 2nd layer solutions. Test all those new software while its in beta. Report bugs. All these things make (or will make) Bitcoin better while BCash stagnates.

You cannot "convert" a wallet. Why would you want to do that? If you have some coins, they are spendable with only the exact address so you cannot really convert them. And if the wallet is empty, you can create a new one without problems so there is no need to convert. 
But if you have coins and you want to switch to a new wallet, when you make the next transaction, instead of automatic change, you send the rest of the balance to a new wallet. And voila, wallet converted.

Something terribly wrong is with this site because the next difficulty will not drop that much. Last difficulty adjustment was after block [491903]( at 2017-10-26 16:52:05. Current block is [493520]( at 2017-11-07 20:46:54. These blocks are 17515 minutes apart with 1617 blocks between. Therefore the next difficulty based on the 1617 blocks is (1617/17515)*10=92.15% current, an almost 8% drop.

It won't. Many people will have a wait and see approach, particularly since the replay protection is not easy to achieve. Others with small unimportant transactions will be put off by the high fees and will postpone transactions. We should survive any non-malicious actions. 
But if the miners form a cartel and start a 51% attack, it will be much more problematic. 51% attack has never happened in the history of Bitcoin because you cannot really gain by it, only destroy. And miners so far were rational. If they attack BTC, B2X and BCH will also take a hit because if it is possible with BTC, it will be possible with any coin and the cryptocoin market will be seen as vulnerable. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:20:35
In Electrum, Tools/Preferences/Fees/Edit fees manually. And on the send tab, you can modify the fee. 
There are a bunch of sites that recommend the fees with various accuracy. The best ones are such that do not show just value but the whole mempool statistics, [like here]( The blocks are about 1MB in size, so the  transactions around cumulative 1MB should confirm if the block is found right away. At around 2MB, you'll have to wait but it is also quite probable that 2 blocks are going to be close apart on the transaction will fit. At about 10 MB, it will definitely take hours to confirme or more. 
Another excellent site (but it's only a present moment snapshot) [is here]( The graph shows the cross-section of mempool and place where the 1MB line crosses the distribution. Most of the transactions below the line will be confirmed in the next block (if it was mined right now), most of the ones above will have to wait.  
[This site]( shows historic fee distribution. 
The problem with fee estimation is that mining is stochastic. There is no schedule and there can be a long delay between blocks. Or a few a minute apart. So you never can be sure. 
It is always best to set up low (but with some chance of confirming) fee and use a wallet that allows "replace-by-fee" fee bumping if the transaction is stuck for a long time.

What do you propose when the block subsidy becomes negligible? The block subsidy will fall below the current  fees in 2024. 
Bitcoin must be expensive to work. There are no workarounds. The mining equipment to mine bitcoin would cost roughly 1.5-2 billion dollars to replace. It protects a 120 billion market. Anyone with 1.5-2 billions in his pocket can have 50% of the hashrate and kill Bitcoin with a 51% attack. Expensive? Maybe. But if there is no block subsidy everything must be paid from fees. And fees must be high enough to provide enough difficulty to deter anybody from doing this attack. And fees can only be high enough if there is competition for the block space.  So block space must be scarce.

Well, it is indeed a free market. But transactions with a fee much larger than the outputs? Who does it repeatedly?

The price is not zero due to closing of the winning positions (those who sold before, now buy BT2 to close the position). You can of course wait for the resolution but the funds are frozen and exchanges have a non-zero risk of folding during that time so it is better to exit now.

It's true that the only blocks that are almost certainly Satoshis are shown [in this picture from the same article]( We know that block 9 was mined by Satoshi (because of the block 9 that used coins for a transaction to Hal) and they all follow the same pattern except for block number 12. 


Yes, it is a conjecture but it is a more probable theory than the theory that Satoshi mined only blocks 1-11,13-14. The mining patters [had a striking regularity]( and are very likely from the same entity and also quite likely from the same entity that mined blocks 1-9.
But of course, unless Satoshi moves these coins it will forever be a conjecture.

I would not recommend setting such a low fee yet. There are more than 7000 transactions &lt;6 sat/byte. So only very lucky ones get included in the block. 
The mempool is currently filled with a bunch of large transactions such as [these]( with 59 kB size and 6 satoshi/byte. After including all the higher-fee ones and these large transactions, there is probably a few kilobytes free and some miners can add a few those 1 satoshi/byte ones. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:24:38
Fee is the difference between sum of inputs and sum of outputs. Input value is not printed but you have a txid of input 3a760e081d7377e2d8d30f74fa6cefd7f6e093ac1480de7b3b6f6551dd294d5d. vout=1 of this transaction (second in human terms) is 6.7250491 BTC.
6.7250491-6.72297416-0.00158000=0.00049494 BTC fee.
There may be simpler tools for that but you can extract the fee with this data and parent transaction.

What you have done is you moved your transaction from about 29 sat/byte to 43 sat/byte. Not enough right now. 
Child pays for parent must pay fees for all the parents and grandparents. Since your parents and grandparents were large, the fee per byte is not impressive.
In the numerator, sum all the fees, and in the denominator, all the virtual sizes:
(.00066900+0.00278280+0.00600000)/(20126+1518+192)*10^8 = 43.29 sat/byte
When you asked the questions, [I told you the child pays for parent will be expensive]( since the parent is huge. 300 satoshi per byte child is not enough. It's the sum of all fees and sizes that matter. 
By the way, everybody now knows what your wallet address is and how much money you have. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:08:45
Fees are less unpredictable than markets and if the fee that is not completely out of touch (at least 10 satoshis per byte), it is just a matter of time. Except in May, where something really crazy was going on (it's possible that it was a market manipulation by a group of miners), the max waiting time for 10 satoshi/byte transaction was 3-4 days. Most of the September and early October, the mempool was not full and it would take just minutes. Now it is moderately full with some days a bit backed up. But every now and then, there is a lull. 
There is also a replace-by-fee option which allows you to bump the fee while the transaction is not yet confirmed but it is considered an advanced option and not many wallet programs include it. 
However, it is not recommended to sent tiny transactions. Even if you pay small fee now, each transaction takes space, so if you want to spend from a wallet that was built from tens of tiny transaction, the transaction will be larger than one bigger one. And the fee is per byte. 
If you want to play with bitcoin, check also testnet. Although testnet was designed for the developers to test the code before using it on live bitcoin, anybody can transact on testnet. Many wallet programs support testnet (but usually you must explicitly specify this option). On testnet, you can get [free coins]( The difference is that testnet blocks are not full, so any fee would be OK but everything else works just the same. The addresses on testnet are different, so it is not possible to accidentally sent bitcoins to a testnet address.

Well, for starters, BCash emergency difficulty adjustment (which now lives in Bitcoin Clashic :) ) was not Satoshi's idea and he would have never created something so stupid.

You must have forgotten the seed as well. 
If for some weird reason, it is the Trezor fault, creation of BIP39 wallets from the seed [can be done in software](
Download a Linux distro. Boot it from USB. Copy the above page to the USB. Boot Linux, do not enable network, open the page in the browser. Enter seed. Copy the addresses.  Check in any block explorer if the addresses have funds available. If yes, the private keys can be used in any wallet. Or the seed can be used in, e.g. Electrum. 
What is the error message when you enter the seed? Seed has a checksum so entering one word wrong would be detected. Perhaps you have also set up an extra password on top of the seed. Without the password the seed is not usable. Neither in Trezor, nor in any software. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:22:18
With Bitcoin, when you send a transaction,you should assume that it is not reversible. You cannot reliably "cancel" the transaction. Even after 72 hours, there may be some nodes that keep the transaction and forward it to miners. I had once a transaction (which I submitted with a ridiculously low fee to test the issue) staying in the mempool for more than a week. My wallet stopped transmitting it but it still got confirmed eventually.
However, you can spend the coins to a different address, essentially cancelling the original (and doing a "double spend" but only one of the transaction will get confirmed) but it is still not 100% reliable as the original transaction may still go through. You can read [a guide how to do it here](

1 satoshi is 0.00000001 BTC.
1 satoshi per byte is equal to 0.00001 BTC/kB.
So 170 sat/byte is 0.00170/kB.
But 170 satoshi/byte  is way too much unless you really *must* have the transaction confirmed immediately. 80-100 should be OK for 1-2 blocks and 20 sat/byte should confirm within a few blocks. See, [the mempool here](

And it is happening again. After BCH price increase, significant hashrate jumped to Bitcoin Cash and BTC blocks again slowed down and BTC mempool is piling up. 
Interesting is that this time BTC reward+fees (2.5-3 BTC per block) are as profitable as mining BCH but fees are not guaranteed and miners probably prefer steadier income stream. Or they expect BCH to increase, at least in short time. 
It will stop ether when BCH/BTC price drops or after about 3 days when BCH difficulty is  going to readjust up.

So maybe alts will kill Bitcoin and then get themselves killed. 
Protecting a hundred billion dollar market from those who may want to kill it cannot be cheap. So mining rewards must be non-trivial. And with low fees, only low difficulty is possible and low difficulty means that the cost of disrupting Bitcoin  (by buying or renting mining equipment to perform a 51% attack) is small. 
Bitcoin can only survive if it is expensive to disrupt. And it can only be expensive to disrupt long term with competition for the block space.

In theory, you can set 0 satoshi/byte but this is a transaction that will be rejected by any standard node (minimum fee to relay a transaction is 1 satoshi per byte). You will have to connect directly to a miner and the miners must be friendly enough to include such a transaction. Now, it's virtually zero chance for it to happen. 
So the minimum is 1 satoshi per byte but segwit introduced a virtual size concept, where witness size counts as 1/4 of the non-witness part. So you can have below 1 satoshi per byte (but exactly 1 satoshi per virtual byte). The lowest possible now is [1 pure segwit P2WPKH input to 1 pure P2WPKH transaction]( with 110 satoshi fee with 110 bytes of virtual size, 192 total size, and an effective 0.57 satoshi per byte.

This recommendation is for those who cannot wait. You have a 90% chance of getting the transaction in the next block. If you are willing to wait 1-2 blocks extra (and in the worst case issue replace-by-fee), 6.1 satoshi/byte is the current rate. 
There are a lot low-fee transactions going through. At the top: 39882 transactions 1-10 satoshi/byte were confirmed in last 336 hours. Large fees are only for those who do not want to wait.

Have you read the Satoshi paper? What is his solution to double spending? Yes, mining. And only mining. Why do you think the Bitcoin Core since the beginning displays not mined transactions as "unconfirmed"? Because with or without RBF one can double spend. P2P networks are not perfectly synchronized and even if double spend attempts are dropped by the nodes, it is still possible to sneak such a transaction. And of course an unscrupulous miner can 
always substitute a broadcast transaction with a different one. 
And then there is a whole issue of chain reorganizations so even lightly confirmed transactions (1-2 confirmations) are not safe. 
Last but not least, RBF is optional so don't project your misguided fears onto us. Don't like RBF, don't use it. But leave the rest of us alone.

No, without ASICs it's just a waste of electricity. A high-end GPU has a 1/10000 hashrate of a single ASIC miner. Millions of GPU would not make a dent.  
What regular users can do is to move a part of their coins to exchanges that will split the coins immediately (bitfinex and hitbtc, maybe others) and dump B2X coins after the split. So the miners will have to mine B2X at a loss. We do not have to dump B2X to the ground, just not let it appreciate above, say 25% of BTC. If BTC survives, one will get a nice profit.

Due to a bug in the early Bitcoin code, extraNonce was not randomized and was increased regularly. The study suggests the same entity mined 980 K coins. Of course, you cannot be completely sure but it is quite likely. And there are unspent coins that do not follow this pattern that likely belong to different miners.

This is a patented bulshit. BTC has never hardforked. BTC is compatible with the BTC protocol to the genesis block. You can take the very first 0.1 Bitcoin code, compile it today (run it probably on RAMdisk because it was too slow to be used with today's blocks) and it will process and accepts current blocks (it will not understand some of the improvement but it will not reject them as invalid). 
You cannot say the same about BCash.

It's not true. [All the Bitcoin forks were soft forks]( You could take an early Bitcoin software and apart from the fact that it won't be able to catch up with the blockchain (because it was awfully inefficient), you could create and broadcast a transaction with it  and it would be accepted by the Bitcoin network. 
The same cannot be said about BCash.

No, in Core you put the fee per kilobyte. Core computes the size and on the confirmation page shows you total fee. You can the cancel and change the fee. But in the dialog box, you put fee per KB. So for 80 sat/byte the fee is .0008 BTC/kB. 
Typical transaction (unless you have very many small coins) is 226 bytes. 0.226 kB * 0.001 BTC/kB = 0.000226 BTC.
The mempool is dynamic, now clearing approximately 60 sat/byte. But the volatility on the market increased the transaction rate and the fees might creep up again.

This post is trolling based on the r/btc (BCH) scheme. Why? Because this point :


is horseshit directly from BCH propaganda mouthpieces. 
All unconfirmed transactions are  "potentially reversible, double-spendable, or cancellable". And if you don't like replace-by-fee (RBF), don't use it. It is purely optional. You don't like receiving such transactions? Require from your customers not to use it. But leave us alone. 
Mining cartel hates RBF because it allows fine-tuning the fees (i.e. lowering). You don't have to send a huge fee for express block confirmation. You can start low and raise it up only if needed.

The programs take historical data as a fee estimation. And because people overpay, the historical data are overstated and it's an endless loop. 
It's best to analyze the mempool directly. These [two]( [pages]( offer a different look at the mempool and are highly useful. In the former, very useful is clicking on the fee level at the legend to ignore some lowe fee transactions, and in the latter, ignore the suggestions, look at the graph.

Yes. For 80 sat/byte it will be 0.00080 BTC/kB. Don't forget to click "Request replace by fee" (it allows you to bump the fee later if you have change in the transaction and there is no harm in using it even if it's not necessary). If you click send, and the program asks for the password, you will have a final page with confirmation. On that page, you'll get the size of the transaction and total fee in BTC (fee is size x fee rate per kB).
But since I wrote it, the mempool got more competitive and with 80 sat/byte, you'll have to wait a least a few blocks. 140-150 sat/byte should give a quick confirmation (but the mempool is growing so who knows), below 130 sat/byte there are a few megabytes waiting and since each block is approximately 1MB, anything below 130 sat/byte will have to wait.

Do not panic (yet). The funds are only spendable by anyone if you  reveal you public key. And the only way to reveal it (well, except of telling us here) is to make a transaction with the same address on the BTC network. So **do not make a transaction from this address on the BTC network**. If you do, the coins will be stolen soon. If you have already spent coins from this address on the BTC network, the funds are vulnerable. 
You can yourself spend these coins by creating a transaction with public key hash in the redeem script. But the transaction is non-standard and only miners can include it in a block. So you have to contact a BCash miner. Or mine yourself. Apparently btc.com have already recovered some funds this way.

Interesting, so they use inferior software because they don't trust Core?


You must have a deep knowledge of all the intrinsic in order to know which is which.

To add up, Bitcoin is actually much better that it was from the Satoshi era. Old version of Bitcoin core would not cope with the current number of transactions (hence the [infamous 0.8.0 split](  A lot of new improvements were introduced, P2SH (and multisignatures), Segwit, light blocks (to speed up the propagation) and many, many smaller improvements.

The problem with this theory is that the next difficulty adjustment will be minimal +-3%. You cannot increase difficulty at the last moment.

Yes you can. But the wallets will be separate. If if you choose one and decide to switch to the other, you will have to transfer funds and pay the mining fee.
But Legacy and Segwit addresses are fully compatible. You can send to and receive from legacy and segwit wallets. 
As the message says "segwit has lower fees, faster signatures and will enable second layer solutions" so it is better and there is no reason to use legacy unless you need it for recovering from old wallets.  
There is an even better BIP171 segwit format available (actually Ledger supports it internally in 1.1.10 firmware but the application does not) with so called bech32 addresses. The fees are even lower and the address has nice error detection benefits but it is not compatible with old wallets.

While I think what the OP did is questionable morally and legally, it is a quite clever hack. 
It was possible due to a few mistakes on the victims part plus the vile design of BCash of reusing the BTC address space. 
Since you cannot create a segwit address in BCash, all these addresses were created as BTC addresses. That's crucial mistake number 1. Since P2SH-P2WPKH outputs in a non-segwit world are spendable by providing the redeeming script that hashes to the address, the victims had to also spend their BTC coins with these addresses (Mistake No. 2). Taking public keys from these BTC transactions, one can recreate the redeeming script and spend the coins. 
There are quite likely more potential victims. The message is clear: if you sent BCH to a segwit address created with BTC **do not spend from these addresses in the BTC chain**. Otherwise, your BCH will be stolen. If you do not spend the BTC coins, the BCH can be recovered by creating a transactions from the public BTC key. 
Edit: Since the anyone can spend transactions are non-standard, only miners can spend them. Antoine Le Calvez, [suggests contacting the miners]( if you mistakenly sent to a segwit address in BCash and not spend it in BTC.

It's not a problem security-wise but it's privacy-wise. Before you wrote the post, nobody could have guessed how many coins you have and which belonged to you (apart from the one in the original post). 
To understand how child pays for parent works, you have to think as a profit maximizing miner. In order to squeeze your transaction, the miner have to remove some other paying transactions. And your transaction must pay more than the removed ones. 
Also, it is not 100% sure way (at least not 100% sure quick way). Some miners run outdated Bitcoin Core that did not calculated all the parents and children and some miners do not use Bitcoin Core. But those that run fairly recent Core would include the child pays for parent transactions.

Though experiment. 80% miners decide to create a fork. Let's name it Bitcoin 2X. Bitcoin 2X will pay not 12.5 BTC per block but 25 BTC. What would happen? The Bitcoin 2X chain may even be longer (it has 80% support) but is rejected by the user nodes. Nobody will want this coin (well, almost, as with BCH/B2X there are always gullible people), the price of Bitcoin 2X tanks and miners lose money.

I would add that addresses that start with 3 are P2SH addresses and can contain many things, including segwit P2SH-P2PKH addresses. The  P2SH-P2PKH addresses can be created from command line in Core 0.15.x. But not all P2SH addresses are segwit-ready. 
There is also a slightly more efficient pure segwit method with so called bech32  addresses, defined in BIP 173 and was merged into git Core late Septemeber and can be used from command line in the git version of Bitcoin Core.

I am against. I think some research can be made towards some increase in future (but only after analyzing the impact of segwit block size increase) but the block size MUST be limited for Bitcoin to work long term. After the block rewards goes to zero (and will become already quite small in not so distant future), the only thing that can keep the mining are the fees. And there has to be competition for fees in the mempool, otherwise the fees tend to zero. Block space must be a scarce resource. 
Mining cartel is for large blocks because they do not think long term. In short term, lower fees may indeed imply bigger adoption and bigger short term profits. In long term, their mining equipment will bite the dust so they only think about short term.

Are you aware that you are the only one that sets the fee? Miners will just accept it or not and they will accept it if there are no higher-paying transaction available. 
If you are willing to wait, you can set 10-20 satoshi/byte = $0.17-0.34 for a typical transaction. The wait time today for such transaction may be more than 10 hours because after yesterday's frenzy the mempool is quite large but it is slowly clearing up.

You have to create a segwit wallet. The one that Electrum can create from its seed uses BIP173 bech32 address that are not supported by many wallets yet and you will have quite some problems with receiving funds with such addresses (but sending from is fine, so you can fund it yourself from a legacy wallet with Electrum and use as a spending wallet). BIP173 addresses provide the smallest transaction size of all the possible ways of sending transactions (hence lower fees) so eventually people will upgrade to this format.
Alternatively, you can create a so called segwit embedded in P2SH (so called P2SH-P2WPKH) wallet with addresses that start with 3 that are supported by all wallets but in Electrum it is not straightforward and I do not recommend it for non-technical users. 
Hardware wallets, Trezor and Ledger support P2SH-P2WPKH as far as I know and it is probably currently the safest path for non-technical users to use segwit.

It's a part of the design. Mining has to be expensive. Otherwise, anybody could cheaply run a 51% attack and destroy Bitcoin.

Btc1/Segwit2x developers, Jeff Garzik in particular, made two separate errors. One is that the fork was advertized (494784) one block later than was coded (494783). So essentially every exchange that would have split the coins at 494784 would have split at the incorrect block. The other error is that in order for the fork to proceed, miners had to mine &gt;1MB block (actually block weight&gt;4M). But there is an error in the btc1 code and in the default configuration, miners could not mine such a block.
Now the chain is stuck, either because nobody bothers to mine with Segwit2x, or they try to mine but cannot create a block that triggers the fork.  Garzik quickly created a patch (so much for well-reviewed code) so if a miner applies this patch (and did not die first from laugh), the chain will proceed. 
Mining each block of Segwit2X chain cost $100,000 lost BTC mining reward so there will be very few takers.

Banking in Europe is cheaper. SEPA transfers are cheap or free but SWIFT are not. I do a wire transfer to US from time to time and it costs me 7€ to send the funds (so far so good) but the US bank charges $16 for the incoming wire and a middle-men bank that you have no way to avoid charges an extra $12. So the total is about $36 regardless of the transaction size. And it takes 3 days (it can take overnight if you pay extra). Bitcoin is still way cheaper and faster.

There is no other way than the consensus. The only other workable solution was to pick a version of the Bitcoin protocol and decide that this is the "true Satoshi vision" and treat everything else as a heresy. This way there will be no ambiguity but the protocol will never improve.

Bitcoin design is that you pay a fee for miners. Miners can include the transaction in the block collecting the fee. Rational miners collect larger fees first. If the are many transactions waiting, miners only include the cream of the fees. If there is a lull, miners include also low-fee transactions because a low-fee is better than nothing. 
This is dynamic but apart from some busy periods, 10-20 satoshi/byte is usually perfectly fine. Even 1 satoshi/byte can go through from time to time (but the wait can be of the order of weeks). 
At worst case, one can use replace-by-fee, when you can bump the fee. Some wallets support it.

My best guess is the you forgot the extra password on top of the seed. 
But if Trezor is somewhat defective, the seed should work in any BIP39 compatible wallet. If it's so much money, buy Ledger Nano and try putting it in Nano. It should also work with the Javascript tool I linked. Or in Electrum. Software wallets are less safe than hardware ones so you may want to wait for the new device.
But, in my opinion, you messed up with the seed. Either by forgetting the extra password (and forgetting that you had an extra password), or by replacing the seed with another one and forgetting to write it down. 
If you used a good password on top of the seed then there is  really nothing you can do about it. If the password were week, you could try to brute force it. If you know the addresses that you have your coins in, it would help with brute forcing.

I hope that what you are doing is with a seed that do not have any bitcoin balance (to claim some semi-worthless stuff like Bitcoin Gold).  Any balance related to this seed, also no balance for the keys that you will not import. Otherwise you can lose your bitcoins and don't do it!. 
If the keys are empty, the easiest way is to [download this page]
( You can run it locally (without internet access). Put your seed, enter BIP49 derivation and locate your address. Take the key and import it into Core. Core should recognize it. It's better to do it on a newly generated wallet (to make the next step easier)
Then, things start to get interesting. Core does not know that it is a segwit key. You have to generate redeeming script for the witness with addwitnessaddress command. But you have to know the key hash of the public key. There are tools avaiable for that but probably the easiest would be to export the wallet to a text file dumpwallet "filename" from Core console. Read the file and locate the address (you will recognize by the private key). Then return to console and do addwitnessaddress address. That is still not enough. You have to rescan the wallet. Exit Core and run it with 
-rescan option.

If you can connect the PV infrastructure to the grid if, for some reason, cryptocurrencies tank, it's less risky than buying coins. If not, it's probably as risky as buying. If Bitcoin "goes to the moon", the profit will be better with buying than mining, though. 
GPU mining is less risky since GPUs are more universal. In case of ASIC mining, the miners are worthless if both Bitcoin price tanks, or there is a breakthrough in mining that makes the old miners obsolete.   
But mining should be an excellent source of income if Bitcoin stabilizes. With cheap energy (if you really have cheap energy, because these PV panels and batteries are not cheap), you can have advantage to other miners.
P.S I do mine with PV but it's a single GPU done more for fun than for profit (see my nick :) ).

There are only two factors that make the switches a bit sticky:

2. It takes 100 blocks for the mined coins to mature so it may not be worth mining temporary blips in profitability

When you created the wallet, Electrum showed the following message:
"Segwit wallets use bech32 addresses, defined in BIP173.
Please note that websites and other wallets may not support these addresses yet. Thus, you might want to keep using a non-segwit wallet in order to be able to receive bitcoins during the transition period."
It is all explained. You can send **to** this wallet from another Electrum wallet. You can send **from** this wallet to anybody. But to receive **from anybody**, you need to either ask them to support bech32 or keep legacy wallet for receiving.
You can also create a P2SH-P2WPKH segwit wallet (I'm sorry that it can be confusing but it's not that difficult after learning a few details) with addresses that start with 3. These are recognized by anybody (but the transactions are larger than BIP173 ones). In order to do it, you need to either have a hardware wallet or create your own BIP39 seed and use m/49'/0'/0 derivation path (and BIP39 option) in Electrum.

So stupid bugs would have never happened to Bitcoin because Core has a team to review the code, instead of a single person. 
But if it had happened, Bitcoin mining would have frozen for some time.  The quick fix would have been prepared and miners would have had to apply this fix. Then slowly, things would have gone back to normal. But in the meantime, fees would have risen to astronomical levels, miners would have lost money for not mining (but would have recouped the extra fees) and there would have been a colossal public relation disaster.

30% DA is close to impossible because it would require a massive jump in hashrate. Already, about half of the time to the next retarget has passed and the hashrate increased by about 10%.  It would have to increase about a further 50% to lead to 30% DA. 
Moreover, your linked formula is incorrect. With the current BCH difficulty algorithm, it is not possible under any BCH/BTC price ratio to have zero block rate for the fee-less BTC.
Correct formula is (assuming currently the BCH/BTC system is at equilibrium):
newBTCspeedratio=( (currentBCHprice * 12.5) /(12.5+currentBTCfees)+1)/ ( (newBCHprice*12.5) /(12.5+newBTCfees)+1)

If it had been sent 3-4 hours ago, it would have confirmed instantly. Now the mempool [is more full]( and the running fee is larger so it may take some time to confirm. Hopefully a few hours but the number of transaction is a bit elevated last few hours.  
It should confirm eventually so unless you are in a big rush, there is nothing to worry.

You sign inputs and outputs (actually hashes of them plus some other stuff sans signature). You have to sign inputs to prove that you have keys to the inputs and you have to sign outputs because otherwise anyone can rebroadcast your transaction and replace outputs with something else.

This is very complicated and with alt-SHA256 even more. Actually BCH should see some stabilization due to the new difficulty adjustment but with B2X we may see wild, destabilizing swings. 
I think the fee estimation based on the historic data does not make sense. Much better is to take the current pool state, estimated hashrate (which can be very inaccurate during miner jumps) and the transaction rate. But then, you have unfilled blocks, transaction that miners take ahead of others and of course stochastic variance. The best advice is to set small fee, broadcast the transaction and if it is not confirmed after some time, increase the fee with with RBF. 
We do not know what would happen if the block size changed. The market reacts slowly. Coinbase or Bitpay would have saved millions if they switch to segwit, yet they don't care. If the blocks were not full, we will have a return of block spammers, including a variant of the infamous Satoshi Dice gambling site which at some point filled majority of the blocks. 
Last but not least, with about 2500 transactions and 12.5 block reward, each transaction has a 0.005 BTC = $35 hidden-fee. After the block rewards goes to zero, all the mining operation would have to be paid from the fees. Fees cannot be small. It's the way the Bitcoin network works and it is inefficient and expensive. It's a price for s trustless system. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:39:47
BCH is not going to work long term. There is no possibility that without second transaction layer (and it is close to impossible without segwit), it is going to scale. If they keep increasing the blockchain, only a few super centers will be able to process it. And then, you have Paypal 2.0. They dont't like, say, Wikileaks, Wikileaks is banned. They don't like you: you are banned. 
Moreover, after the block reward reduces, the mining must be supported by fees. And either the fees are large enough, or the mining stops. 
Miners love it because miners only think short term. In long term, all the mining equipment they have will be worthless, so it is a "grab the money and run" type of business.

Segwit transactions are only FROM a segwit address. So if you send coins to a newly generated address from addwitnessaddress, the next transaction will be segwit. 
Core support for segwit in the stable version is not very user-fiendly (but the developers warn about it). Be aware that if you recover form a backup wallet, the address generated with addwitnessaddres will not be present and you will not see the coins. So either do backup after each transaction or make a note of the address you generated the witness from. Only after making addwitnessaddress and rescanning, you will see the coins in the latter case. 
Also, the change generated is always legacy.
The next version will have it or if you are brave (but start with testnet first), [this code](  which is about to be included in the master, contains an (almost) complete segwit support. 
Electrum has a better segwit support but bech32 (BIP173) type is not wildly recognized by other wallets (but gives the smallest transactions and may be very good as a sending wallet). You can also create P2SH-P2WPKH wallets (the same as Bitcoin Core with addwitnessaddress) either from a hardware wallet or from a BIP39 seed. 
I tested almost all the address types in Electrum, ask me if you have questions.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:34:48
You propose a BIP. It's get discussed. You provide the benefits and possible drawbacks. You propose the ways to reduce the drawbacks. If there is a wider support, the code can be merged into Bitcoin implementations (including Core). The code is extensively tested on testnet. Users update their software. The miners update their software. After some period the change locks-in. After some time, the change is going live. With wide support, the minority chains dies. Everybody is happy. 
A hardfork is always disruptive. it is extremely stupid to do a hardfork with just a single change: block size increase. If doing a hardfork, we can add other changes, like, I don't know, smoother difficulty adjustment (with completing coins 14 days becomes very long).  It cannot be done with a rushed, not discussed, not consulted change that does not permanently solve anything.

Gresham's law is one of the most misunderstood economic concepts. And you repeat this misunderstood view. 
Gresham's law requires that the "bad" and "good" money are interchange'able 1:1 (or at least by a constant factor), i.e. "good" and "bad" money are pegged.  It is easy to understand with precious metals coins. If there are two coins denominated 1 denarius, with the first containing 1 g of silver and the other 0.5 g of silver, the latter will be spent and the former will be melted, hence "bad" money drives out good. But if there is no peg, this law does not apply. Therefore, this law has absolutely no meaning to bitcoin relations with fiat  since bitcoin is not pegged to fiat.

Incorrect. There is nothing magical about listening node apart from the fact that if you do not listen, you cannot be connected to first. But if you connect to any listening node, you are as full as anybody on the network. You verify, you transmit, re-transmit, share blocks, etc. 
It is possible that if a new listening node appears to the network, you can connect to it (either manually by watching bitnodes.earn.com) or automatically by peer discovery and you can send to it your complete blockchain without being a listening node.

Batching also reduces the number out outputs. Instead of multiple transactions with 2 outputs (recipient and change), you have multiple recipients and at most one change.
But it is a combinations of things: segwit, batching and less hype. With the reduced fees now we have a lot of input consolidations, hence UTXO set is down.

This assumption is false. The channel closing transaction is presigned by the victim and cannot be replaced-by-fee (RBF) because the attacker does not have the victims key.  He cannot do child pay for parent (CPFP) until the timelock expires to help confirming these transactions. The victims are always in advantage because they can do CPFP immediately as there is no timelock at their side.

Exactly the same can be argued about Bitcoin itself. 


Sure, because there is zero benefit in purchasing an Amazon gift card (unless doing it with a discount and spending immediately). It's better to keep fiat if you like having fiat. At least you can earn interest. You can pay Amazon with fiat 1:1 so there is no extra benefit with the Amazon token. 
Do I need to explain to you what the benefits of bitcoin vs fiat are? Because keeping bitcoin is not the same as keeping fiat. 
And LN-locked bitcoins are (apart from the opening transaction fees) actually not locked at all compared to the onchain bitcoins. Because you can always spend them, and the closing transaction can spend the funds to somebody else, so there are no extra fees. So by paying the channel opening fees, you open up an opportunity to participate in LN and you can always go back with no extra fees.

It does not work this way. They work like a bank. Most of their customers (i.e. merchants) receive money in fiat and the rest also gets the BTC later, in daily settlements. And these settlements are stored in their account at BitPay and customers transfer them on the Bitcoin network even less frequently than daily. So BitPay swims in liquidity. They never need to transfer on the network right away. 
Now the vast majority of transactions they receive are very small. Tens, maybe hundreds of dollars of worth each. It's not a problem for them to provide the liquidity to freeze the funds in unconfirmed transactions with low fees. These small transactions could wait weeks for consolidation and it would still not be a problem for BitPay. 
And 40 sat/byte does not guarantee anything. There were periods yesterday when you would have to wait an hour or two anyway with 40 sat/byte. So why not send 2 sat/byte and the result would be almost the same, just instead of 1 window of 1-2 hour wait, you have a few. 
Sure, all this would require a sane fee policy and fee monitoring but such business as BitPay should have researched it ages ago. And let's not forger they still not support segwit that would save them almost half of the fees directly and even more indirectly by receiving congestion (BitPay is large enough that their transactions constitute a significant fraction of the blockspace). So they complain about the "network fees" but they contribute to the bloat. 


Sure and a business like BitPay should have contributed a lot of money to its development. But as far as I know they sponsor zero development effort in this area.

The minimum fee may be lowered some day but now you cannot confirm transactions below 1 satoshi per virtual byte unless you mine it yourself because all the miners require 1 sat/vbyte or larger.  
For fun, I set up my full node to accept transactions down to 0.1 sat/vbyte and it picked up a few such, [like this one]( but it sits for several days unconfirmed because no miner is willing to confirm it, even though there were a lot of blocks below 1MB.

In Bitcoin blockchain, only unspent outputs can have balances. There is no such thing as "addresses with funds", it's only a wallet feature.  It is a bit of nit picking in this context but it is important. People are frequently surpized why the fee is so huge even though they are sending "from a single address" if the funds were recieved in multiple transactions. 
So, yes outputs with balances are treated differently than outputs that are spent. But **outputs**, not addresses, full nodes do not look up the addresses while verifying the transactions.

The simulation is funny but quite misleading. You get get into the "full bus" if you pay a higher fee that the lowest-paying passengers from the bus.

1. It is a problem and is going to be a problem. A partial defense is that the funds locked in LN are going to be small for most non-professional users. The hubs that have many channels are a different story. Sending is safer and occasional sending can be done completely airtight. Receiving and routing have to be with hot wallets. 
2. I believe the current gossip method (everybody knows everything) does not scale and must evolve to something more clever. [Read this discussion]( about this problem. 
3. Channel rebalancing is a problem but can be mitigated by, e.g. exchanges. The users that mostly send can refill their channels and the businesses can empty theirs.

Addresses do not contain balances in Bitcoin. Addresses are just handles to public keys with their corresponding private keys. Only transactions matter.

Spent one can be forgotten after verification but unspent must be kept forever (until spent).

LN in itself is not and is not going to be free. It is going to be much cheaper than the blockchain fees, particularly for small and micro transactions but the capital is not free and there are fees. Moreover, you pay fees for opening and closing a channel but these fees will be amortized over multiple transactions you can perform over this channel.  
It would not be as safe as in cold wallet to keep bitcoins in a LN network channel but for small values the risk should be acceptable.   
There will always be blockchain transactions. LN would be only competitive to small transaction, large transactions will be done on chain. The economics of the blockchain transactions is different than the LN ones. In blockchain, the block size is the scarce resource, hence the fee depending on the size of the transactions and there is a limited number of transaction that can fit the block but they can be arbitrary large in value. In LN, the frozen capital is scarce, hence the fees would depend on the value of the transaction but you can do arbitrary many of them.

Of course users could lose money. The code did not use a deterministic seed so you would have to backup the wallet after each transaction. There were breaking changes after you had to close all the channels (and paying the mining fees). I used lnd on testnet and after closing the channels and upgrading the code,  some funds were not returned and I couldn't figure out how to get the funds. After spending a few hours I gave up and nuked the wallet as the testnet coins are worthless. I'm still unsure if the funds were recoverable or lost.   The code is more stable and safe now but I'm not going to use it on mainnet before extensive testing on testnet.

0.5 sat/byte for a segwit transaction counting bytes, yes. But &lt;1 sat/ virtual byte, where virtual byte = weight/4 is extremely rare.

Schnorr reduces the size of the signature. If you have 100 inputs, instead of submitting 100 signatures, you'll submit one. There are two buts
1. Schnorr in Bitcoin will almost certainly be implemented as a soft fork with new Schnorr-aware addresses, i.e. legacy addresses will not be schnorrable. 
2. Schnorr reduces the size of the signature only, the non-signature part must be supplied, including TXID and outpoint of the output to be spent (36-bytes) and sequence (4-bytes) and (though I'm not 100% sure) public keys (33 bytes).  Therefore, the reduction for combining 100 signatures (approximately 73 bytes) is not 100-fold but much less (about 50%). Moreover, segwit already discounts the signatures so the effective reduction is even less impressive in case of segwit. 
So dust will still be dust in Schnorr-aware world, though a the bar for dust will be a bit lowered.

I think this conclusion is based on false premises. If I understand this methodology, they compared the current market cap to the product of price and mining production during the lifetime of Bitcoin. It is completely false. It assumes that miners sell all the coins as soon as they are mined and do not hodl. It is not true even now and in early bitcoin the fraction of the coins immediately sold was even lower. With miners hodling, they sell coins at higher prices than when they were generated and the whole inflow of money from buyers to miners is much larger.

Each node sets up its own fees. The market will determine the effective fees.
In the protocol, there two fees possible: one per transaction and one per BTC moved. Current default in lnd is 1 satoshi per transaction and one millionths of the value. The latter value will likely be higher when the LN matures but the former may be even lower. There is very little cost of moving a transaction (just a few hundred of bytes of data) and LN defines internally millisatoshis.  
We can only guess how the market will work out. I would guess that it would cost a sub satoshi (0.1?) to send a satoshi, a satoshi to send 1000 satoshi and 100 satoshi to send 0.01 BTC. Larger values will likely be more competitive on chain. 
The fees are charged for each sending, so if you have a multi hop transaction, each node will collect its own fees.

The BCH and BTC code diverged so much that implementing Segwit in BCH is not going to be easy. Moreover, they hate Segwit with passion, spent enormous effort to make it look bad, and them being non-Segwit is one of the three major pillars of their "religion" (the other two are big blocks and 0/confirmations) and questioning one of the pillars would create a risk of a schism.

P2SH is mainly used for multi-signature transactions and as a compatibility-container for segwit transactions. 
The major benefit of P2SH is that it can contain almost any Bitcoin script and yet it is small, you can hide all the complexity from the address and the sender does not need to support anything from this script. Only at spending, this complexity is reveled.

No, it's a senseless overpaying. For the last two days, even a measly 60 sat/vbyte guaranteed the next block inclusion every time. In the last week, 100 sat/vbyte was enough. 200 sat/byte would be overpaying and 2600 sat/vbyte is insane. Never in the history of Bitcoin, such a fee was required for the next block inclusion. The largest ever was 1400 sat/vbyte. 
And in Bitcoin mining nothing is guaranteed. There are spells of no blocks 1 hour apart and no fee can speed it up.

The victims have 95% at stake and can use 5% of the attackers funds. If 5% is not enough for the fee, they will lose but the attacker always loses more unless the victim does nothing for the duration of the time lock. 
My point is the attack can only work as DoS. It's not possible to monetary gain because the victims are always ahead. They have time advantage (no time lock) and money advantage (attackers funds can be used for the mining fee in the penalty transactions).  The attacker can probably only fill a single block with closing transactions (and still cannot spend them) before he is going to be outbid but the victims. The result is: a bunch of people lose some money on the fees, the attackers loses a lot of money on fees and loses the justice penalties, the miners win. The same result can be done by spamming the blockchain now. 
This LN "attack" scenario has also a few additional improbable assumptions. That he opens thousands of channels, then practically empties them. A lot of victims will close the channels ahead of the attack particularly since they will not pay the closing fees (fee are paid by the side that opens a channel). It's also quite difficult to empty the channels, the victims will have to have extra full channels to other parties to move the money. The attacker can lookup the public information to see who has extra open channels but he has no way to see what is the status of the channel (how much is on the victim's side and how much on the counterparty). The effect is such that there will be large fractions of channels that are unable to be emptied out and he does not know about it beforehand.

It's nice and all but the problem is that they overcharge as hell. You can now pay 147 satoshi per legacy input or 91 if segwit and have it consolidated within a few hours (and why should they be in a hurry) but they ask their customers to pay 50-100 times more than that.

About 2 days ago mining Bitcoin Cash became more profitable than Bitcoin and miners flocked to Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin blocks slowed down and mempool (unconfirmed transactions) [started to keep rising]( Miners include first highest fee transactions and yours in in the middle of the pool. 
In about 8h, Bitcoin Cash will [become unprofitable again]( and the clog will likely start to clear. 
You can wait, eventually it will go through (but may take another day or two) or if you have a wallet that can bump the fee, you can bump it. But current fee for including in the next block is 290-300 satoshis/byte, so 5 times your fee. 
With the arbitrage opportunities for the miners, these types of oscillations will come back again until Bitcoin Cash dies in obscurity or Bitcoin (or Bitcoin Cash) changes difficulty adjustment algorithm to quicker react on hashrate changes.

This transaction is 1.08 satoshi per virtual byte. So it looks and works just like a regular transaction. It would have it be below 1 sat per virtual byte (i.e less than 4 satoshi per weigh unit) not do be propagated.

To me the most important feature of running a full node is to verify that miners do not cheat. No light node can check if the miners did not add extra coins to their coinbase. 
There will be enormous pressure at the time of the next halving to add inflation to Bitcoin. Without a robust network that can reject this inflacoin, we cannot be sure that the Bitcoin monetary policy will always be sound. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:30:31
Bitcoin addresses are not like account numbers in fiat banks. 


Because full nodes (including miners) do not care if you have, say, 10 unspent outputs that correspond to the same address or 10 unspent outputs that correspond to 10 different addresses. In both situations, in order to spend these funds, you have to provide 10 TXID/outpoint pairs and 10 signatures. The size of the transaction is the same, therefore there is absolutely no benefit ([and a lot of drawbacks]( of reusing addresses. 
It's best to mentally think only about coins, i.e. unspent outputs and use a different address for each receive operation. It enhances privacy, security and has  no drawbacks (maybe a tiny one of the need of keeping more private keys but with deterministic wallets it's not a problem at all).  
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:16:58
Running full node is always good for the network but for the hodlers, the best defense against segfit2x is to sell B2X token just after the split. Low B2X price = miners jumping to BTC chain. We do not have to sell it to the ground. Just to keep the prices from pumping up. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:03:17
Yes, indeed. 
Moreover, although this bunch of dust outputs will still be in the blockchain, it will no longer be a part of unspent transaction output database (UTXO), reducing the memory footprint for the full nodes. Additionally,  the full nodes that prune the blockchain will no longer need to store it. So it is a win-win for everybody. 
You may ask, why not consolidate everything? By consolidating, you show to the world that you own all these addresses and if you consolidate outputs with 1 BTC and 1000 BTC, everybody you transacted with this 1 BTC will know that you also own 1000 BTC.

You aren't suggesting that BitPay sends the proceeds to an exchange right away, are you? Because, you know, even with a million satoshi per byte fee, there are times when there is no block for an hour due to random variance. And during that time BTC can lose 20%. 
So, no, BitPay does not need to send the customers funds to an exchange in a express way. They either have funds on an exchange or they hedge with futures. And, as I explained earlier, [BitPay swims in liquidity](  so they can afford to wait a few hours.  
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:49:42
Credit cards settle for days and sometimes weeks. During that time, the funds are not yours and can be reverted at Visa/MC's will. Theirs security is comparable with 0/conf Bitcoin transactions. If you trust your customer, you'll be fine, if not you can be scammed. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:19:34
Yes, it stabilized a bit but blocks are still going slower than 6 blocks per hour and BCH has even higher block rate. It's good that many miners are not maximizing short-term profit because otherwise BTC could completely slow to a halt. 
I'm afraid it's going to get worse with B2X with huge swings of hashpower and slow confirmation time on one of the chains. The one with lower hashrate would fare much worse.

You would have saved 56 bytes (91 instead of 147 per input) if you used segwit. And 40 sat/byte in the current fee market is ridiculous. 2 sat/byte were sufficient to confirm in most of the blocks today and at worst required a 2-3 hours wait and 1 sat/byte were also confirmed, though the queue is longer. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:15:01
[This article]( has a very detailed and easy to understand list of objections for the Segwit2x.
I would add that there must be a block limit, otherwise the blockchain will be filled with transaction spam. So any proposals with unlimited block size are economically impossible (a proposals with minimum fees are equivalent with block size limit).  The limit must provide a balance between the interests of bitcoin users, miners, and those running the full nodes. The latter ones are unpaid and must bear the CPU, bandwidth and disk cost of verifying transactions (and are necessary, e.g., to check if the miners do not cheat so having miners only is not enough). With the increasing of the block size, the cost of running full nodes increase, discouraging this vital (unpaid) role. If the blockchain is so large that home users are unable to run the full nodes, only large centralized servers survive, creating a risk of bitcoin cartelization. 
There is probably some room for increasing the block size without making the  cost of running the full nodes too excessive but we have recently increased the effective block size by Segwit 1.0 and any other change should be well prepared and not forced upon the users by a handful of organizations.

Bitcoin fees are the price to pay for the limited space in the blockchain. Fees are independent of the transaction value but depend on their size in bytes. Transactions with large number of inputs and/or outputs are larger. 
Fee per byte is dynamic. Good wallets allow you to specify the fee before the transaction. You set up the fee and miners can include your transactions or not. They usually include the highest paying transaction first, so if there are a lot of people that want to transfer bitcoin (in jargon, the mempool is large), the required fee may be higher. If there is low demand (at the moment it is not very high) the fee can be small, of the order of 5-10 satoshi per byte which for the typical transaction is about 7-15 cents. If you are willing to wait for the mempool to be empty and are willing to have some chance of aiting long time, you may have luck with just 1 satoshi/byte which is 1-2 cents. I did such a transaction last week.  
There are many sites to monitor the current market fees. [This site]( is very nice if you understand the size dynamics. [This is another one]( with fee recommendations. 
[This one shows historical fees]
( As you can see, you can send transactions for pennies but you may have to wait. Typical transaction is 226 bytes.

1. Anything that fixes malleability is equivalent to Segwit: the only way to fix it is by removing signatures from TXID. And it's something that BCH camp hates with passion and spent a lot of effort demonizing. Flextrans are as popular in the BCH camp as Segwit. 
2. BCH only fixed third-party malleability. "First"-party (i.e. by signer) malleability is still wide open. 
3. Currently implemented LN requires Segwit. There is no development on any alternative approach in the BCH camp. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 20:02:58
If the BTC address is segwit and its corresponding public key has already been seen on the network, the BCH sent to such address can be claimed by anybody. There were such cases.

2700 satoshi is $0.189
And you can pay less, 5 satoshi per byte or even 1. For a typical non-segwit 226 byte transaction, 1 satoshi/byte* 226 bytes is 1.5 cents and segwit reduces it to 1 cent. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:35:36
Let's not exaggerate. The lowest fee (unless you mine yourself) is 1 sat/vbyte and the lowest transaction size is [110 vbytes]( So on chain, the lowest practical fee is 110 satoshi. 
But indeed you can move 1000 satoshi (about $0.07) by paying 110 satoshi fee (about $0.008).

If one has to trust the miners, why bother with mining. Let Bitmain have a database with all the transactions and just take a small fee.  It would be cheaper, faster and more eco-friendly. /s
