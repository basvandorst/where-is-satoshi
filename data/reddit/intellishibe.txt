Do you have your old public addresses? If so, check them on a block explorer.
Do you have your backup seed?

It's not going to go through with that small of a transaction fee anytime soon. It's not about how much bitcoins you send, it's about what is the size of the transaction (in bytes).
You can spend the output of the transaction with a higher fee (aka child-pays-for-parent) to help the initial transaction one go through. The fee needs to be large enough for two transactions. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:48:18
Yeah! There's about 8.5MB of 100+ sat/byte transactions in the mempool right now. So I guess if this keeps going for about 15-20 more blocks, my transaction will finally go through!

Your invoice is in Euros, you're looking at the USD rate. The Euro rate right now is €9,503.58 on that page.

The argument is that they will have control over the network, for example they could refuse you if you don't agree to KYC.
IMO this isn't even a big deal. There will be nefarious nodes but there will also be nodes which will be fine.

Coinbase doesn't support the bp1 segwit addresses that Electrum makes.

Helping the bitcoin network (and possibly getting some donations). There's no financial benefit from running a node.

That, but also applications that have nothing to do with Bitcoin.

You're right that it would significantly change the BTC/USDT markets, as those token would prove useless and the BTC/USDT price will go up significantly as the presumption of 1:1 USD/USDT becomes invalidated.
However, I'm not sure how it would affect the BTC/USD market. It could hurt prices as more and more people will jump to the USD exchanges to trade their BTCs, therefore crashing the price but I suppose that will recover quite quickly.
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:06:01
Yeah we don't know the exchange wallets. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:19:17
There are different degrees to decentralization. Bitcoin is still much more decentralized compared to fiat currencies, but less decentralized to ASIC-resistant coins like Vertcoin or ZCash. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:25:37
Where is DOGE? How on earth could you make this without adding DOGE!
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:51:14
The thing is, if there's no token being awarded then there's no incentive for mining. So it won't be decentralized anymore.
But there's more to blockchain technology than being a decentralized ledger. It has other applications as well. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:44:31
If you had enabled the "replace-by-fee" option, there's hope. Otherwise, there's no way to force the mempool to replace the old transaction with the new one, instead, they will probably recognize this as a double-spend and reject the transaction.
Your best hope is the CPFP option (child pays for parent), spend the remainder of the transaction with a larger fee (for the size of both transactions) and it will probably go through.

CryptoID says this about their guesstimated wallet ownerships:

Let's hope my 10-day-old unconfirmed transaction will get picked up by a miner!
Edit: It's confirmed! 
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:26:13
Yes. See. It has its uses that people who dislike Bitcoin can get excited about.

While it's technically possible to compile it in Windows, it's too much work. It's best to cross-compile it for Windows on linux. You can use a linux virtual machine or get a cheap/free linux VPS.
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:36:18
Increased hashrate on the network which results in more blocks in a given time. This will be rectified at the next difficulty readjustment. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:20:59
Check your address(es) on a block explorer (blockchain.info, BTC.com, etc) and you can see the transaction history.
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:05:40
Depends on how strong the password is. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:49:59
Install an open-source local wallet (Bitcoin core, Electrum, etc), backup your private keys or your seed and then transafer the money into your new addresses. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:29:49
There will be fewer transactions on the blockchain, but with the Bitcoin network growing more and more, there will be enough on-chain transactions to support the mining process. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:03:06
Because the network isn't dependant on the government, unlike the stock or gold market. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:46:34
DAMN HODLERS. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:17:57
Yeah. If a person has to ask on a general Bitcoin subreddit, it's best to not do it until a well-vetted wallet implements the feature.

Tether is fiat without actually having the fiat.

You can install linux in a virtual machine in literally minutes.

There are malware which are quite intelligent. When you go offline, they still run and record your keylogs, store them somewhere and read it back when you reboot later.
This is why you should use a hardware wallet, or at least, use an airgapped computer entirely which is never online. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:26:45
Still better than having no transactions at all. Dogecoin has more transactions than BCH.

Try @_date: 2018-01-31 19:53:24
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:42:21
You're right. The fee as in sat/byte doesn't need to be higher. Transactions with higher inputs have more bytes in them.
My mistake was that I assumed there was one input, so I set a fee (manually) that should have roughly translated to 500 sat/byte. But there were 5 inputs instead of 1, so the sat/byte fee went down to 94 in my case. Totally my mistake. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:09:02
I usually trade locally. Safest/best rate. Have been able to get a $100 Amazon gift for $80 worth of BTC! 
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:30:53
That's certainly a possibility (and BTC has gone up since the shutdown). Obviously any lack of trust in the centralized economy would translate to increased interest in Bitcoin, but it's not a univariate relationship. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:29:38
No, the second output is the remainder going into their own wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:19:40
Like Australia moving their stock exchange technology to blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:40:43
So this transaction was sent by Coinbase, not you?
Or did they sent it to your Blockchain and you sent this one from there?
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:59:04
You can't double spend this, the mempool will reject it as it's not tagged as replaceable by fee. You should either spend the output of the transaction with a high fee or wait until it's eventually forgotten by the mempool, then you can spend it again with a higher fee.
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:00:47
The lack of transparency and audits is the real issue for this so-called FUD. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:34:02


@_date: 2018-01-20 06:17:08
Yeah that's a rediculous amount, especially today as the mempool is getting empty rather quickly. Even 100 sat/byte would confirm it in the next block.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:28:41
Transactions are stored on the blockchain, nobody can delete them.
Update the firmware of the Ledger, restore the seed and see the balance on your addresses. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:41:40
Non-segwit enabled wallets might not see the transaction if you ever decide to send it to them. Some exchanges are not SegWit enabled yet. That's the only risk. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:52:29
Bankers are the price manipulators.
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:22:08
You're right that we can only trust as far as the miners are trustworthy (the more decentralized, the larger the conspiracy has to be). But that isn't tne end of blockchain technology. A centralized blockchain can, for example, offer transparency and enforce certain regulations that will be impossible to avoid. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:58:17
I doubt it would even affect it.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:15:06
It's really up to the nodes and their mempool removal policy. Some do it after a few days, some even keep rebroadcasting old ones which means indefinite existence in the mempool.
If you do another identical transaction it will be rejected by the nodes, becasuse it's a double-spend.
Which wallet are you using? In the future, always tag the "replace by fee" option in your settings. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:26:51
Electrum doesn't even support importing private keys anymore, only sweeping them. Which obviously incurred a transaction fee. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:15:30
Gemini and Gdax.
Always do a small transaction to ensure everything is working flawlessly before committing to a large transactions.

If you were such a good merchant you'd have checked the rules and would have known that sale ads are not allowed on this sub.
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:06:32
Yes. But as you said, it's not supported by any wallets, so it's not directly possible *at this time*. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:25:24
They said they would support it, and today the mempool is basically getting flushed into the blockchain so I figured they may have started it, given how they've been more or less the sole reason that transaction fees were getting out of hand anyway. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:05:34
No. You should just wait until it's forgotten.
There are also transaction acceleration services that people sell online (which I don't trust unless sold by a pool directly, like BTC.com or ViaPool). It will cost you, but they can get it approved quickly.

Bitcoins haven't been mined using GPUs for years.

Those who need to keep the lights on will sell their bitcoins for life necessities. Those who don't will extract their money from stock market and buy more bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:09:50
Imagine I send you 1 BTC to a wallet address, you want to spend 0.05 BTC of it. The transaction will be the 1 BTC input in your wallet, with two outputs, one 0.05 BTC going to whoever you're sending it to, and a 0.95 BTC going back to you (usually another address that you own).
Coinbase uses the Bitcoin that another person deposits to give you in your withdrawal. So there's always a remainder which goes to another wallet, to be used to send Bitcoins to someone else.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:02:36
Coinbase has said that they will support segwit soon. So you might just give it some time.
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:02:40
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:22:03
Not directly. You can send them to a multisig address and keep your keys secret until that block has passed.
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:37:26
Those are most likely exchanges cleaning up deposits and processing withdrawals. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:51:53
I'll volunteer to eat it. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:46:04
Definitely an exchange sending deposits to their cold storage wallet then. Really can't say which one though, unless someone who has deposited to those addresses can comment. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:15:00
Jochen-hoenicke doesn't count no-fee transactions, bloclchain.info does. That's the difference. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:31:14
Yeah they'd want to brag about it! 
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:53:23
Yeah, that isn't going to get through anytime soon. Until some major event (like massive adaptation to SegWit and lightning network) happens that empties the mempool. Even if you have access to the output, it's not large enough to push two transactions in. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:54:04
Maybe that's a good idea, maybe isn't. But that's a different discussion. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:40:24
Sorry not gonna post the txid (for privacy), but my fee is 94 sat/byte. I actually wasn't aware that I was using multiple inputs otherwise my fee would have been fine for a single input transaction.
The mempool is almost getting empty of 100-140 sat/byte transactions, so mine will be next! Here's to hoping Coinbase (or whoever else) wouldn't begin spamming the mempool again! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:26:42
It already has. Look at SegWit and Lightning Network.
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:20:01
Someone (likely an exchange) didn't look at the mempool before sending the transactions, assumed 200+ sat/byte is still necessary. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:32:56
No it's not. The address is generated from the public key, but it's not the public key. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:16:58

Direct LN transactions have no fee at all. A fee is paid once it's opened and once again when the network is settled onto the blockchain.

@_date: 2018-01-20 02:56:01
Bitcoin CPU/GPU mining is dead. Your best bet is to use a pool that mines GPU mineable coins (Vertcoin, ZCash, etc...) and sells them to get BTC. That's how you get most profits. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:07:39
Some wallets have not been updated to support those addresses, so they fail a address verification check.
