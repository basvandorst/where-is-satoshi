My understanding is that you will be able to buy and sell from within the app like Circle or Coinbase.

That piece was an interesting read, but also quite idealistic. If that idiology were not shared by law enforcement, and it most certainly is not, questionable activities could land one in jail even if it were not possible to say with absolute certainty that the Bitcoin address involved belongs to the accused. One must only convince a jury, whose entire knowledge of the block chain will be provided by the prosecuting attorney. The no taint argument reminds me of the folks that claim we don't need to pay income taxes. No matter what ideological or historical or legal arguments one presents, the IRS will jail you if you don't pay.
Does anyone else believe that there is no such thing as Bitcoin taint?

It seems that if you are going to the trouble to use TOR, you should be using TAILS.

I think that taint has a lot to do with how you acquire your bitcoins. If you were to buy bitcoin on Coinbase then your identity would be tied to the bitcoin address that received the coins. If you then went on to deposit those bitcoin at one of the popular bitcoin gambling sites, Coinbase would likely shut down your account. The coins were tainted in so much as they could reasonably be tied to your identity.
Removing taint in the narrow sense refers to cleaning illegal activity from coins.  This is just dilution. As coins get mixed around from transaction to transaction, all coins will bear some degree of illegal activity. The point is that your freedom may depend on not having that activity associable with your identity. 
An example given in the article at the beginning of this thread is that of someone wanting to donate to Edward Snowden's legal defense. Some see him as a traitor and others as a true patriot. As the Supreme Court has argued that money represents free speech, one could make the argument that supporting his legal defense is a form of free speech. If you were to contribute though, you'd be guilty of a federal crime. In such a scenario it would be important to remove the taint from your donation. Once there is no way to reasonably associate the donation with your identity, you could make it with fear of reprisal from the state.
Your example of concluding that all bitcoin users had played SatoshiDice is actually a perfect example of why coin mixing works. Once tainted bitcoins have been widely mixed it is not possible to confidently associate them with any identity. Remember, circumstantial evidence is quite admissible in a court of law and can be enough for a conviction. Furthermore, when a corporation is making a decision about whether or not to do business with you, just the possibility of unsanctioned activity may be enough for them to permanently sever the relationship. Removing taint removes suspicion, preserves your anonymity and puts you in the position of power as a free actor in the global economy.

Are the protocols described in the article on point, or are there better practices to ensure privacy?

What altcoins do you think would be the best to mix with through Shapeshift in order to erase taint? What if Shapeshift were compromised? Would the mixing trail be traceable?

 sounds like a good mixing service. I like the idea that they have at least some accountability through their letter of guarantee address to keep them from stealing your coins. I don't know if this is an effective solution, but it always seems that there are rumors circulating around services like CoinFog that they are stealing coins. It's hard to know if the accusations are a disinformation campaign or people who have been legitimately taken advantage of.

I wonder if the commodity declaration is going to ease concerns of lawmakers as you suggest, or perhaps provide the schema for how to create more regulation. I know very little about commodities trading so I really don't know. 
If anyone reading this knows about commodities trading regulation as it stands today and how we got here, I'd be very interested to hear a summary.

Decentralisation is one of Bitcoin's key value propositions. In order for us to have a more free and equal financial world, our means of transfer must not be controlled by a central authority.

The Airbitz Bitcoin wallet is pretty exciting - Open source, AES256 bit encrypted on both the device and server, one-touch 2 factor authentication and with a giant directory of local merchants that accept Bitcoin built in to the app.

The best security system is the one you actually use. Marrying convenience and security is the way forward for Bitcoin mass adoption. Kudos to Airbitz for bringing that reality closer.

With edge security technologies now available, the only excuses for a company to leave your private data vulnerable is either ignorance to the solution or I desire to spy upon &amp; monetize your private information.

I love the look of the new interface. Way cleaner.

It's so counter to today's track and measure everything culture that I find it amazing. With such a strong push to make everything in the natural world known, I think that we got blinded to the fact that many things are best left unknown. I look forward to a future trend where people and companies celebrate the things that they don't and can't know.
