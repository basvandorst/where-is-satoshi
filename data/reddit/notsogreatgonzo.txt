I'm not regretting anything :) I bought my coins with money that I didn't expect to get (fixed a few computers for a local company, and to my surprise I got paid based on what they actually saved, not on the time I spent) , and it didn't have any consequences for my normal budget.  
If I had bought a new laptop for that amount, it would have depreciated more or less the same, and with a lot less chance of it ever increasing in value again :)

I bought at $ 731, so I've been enjoying the ride for more than a year now.
