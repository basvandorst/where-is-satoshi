Can you walk us through how to do it as that blog does not make sense to me.
I open up bitcoin app on chrome and go to Settings -&gt; Blockchains in the overview of "Ledger Wallet Bitcoin".
We are asked:
Which bitcoin chain do you want to use?
 
Bitcoin Cash
Bitcoin UASF
Bitcoin Segwit 2x
I choose 
Bitcoin Cash
And buttons "Main" and "Split" are available:
Select the "Main" option to transact using your main Bitcoin account and initially transfer your coins to a dedicated account, or the "Split" option to transact using a dedicated account.
Totally confused there what it means or what should I click. What is dedicated account to begin with?

They are based out of Europe, Lithuania and they advertise the site heavily when watching local TV especially basketball. I remember having problems registering there before as I live in US but with BTC it probably changed?
