Are you new here?  You can buy a shit ton of things with btc.


There's also other ways out there that also let you spend your btc anywhere using a crypto-debit card.

I think it can be explained with the term *declining baselines*.
**Declining Baselines:** *This phenomenon is something we all encounter daily, even if some of us rarely notice it. It happens often enough to have a name: declining baselines. The phrase describes the process of becoming accustomed to and accepting as normal worsening conditions. Along with normalization can come a forgetting that things were not always this way. And this can lead to further acceptance and further normalization, which leads to further amnesia, and so on.*
Economic conditions worsen gradually until people become used to them. Btc trading above 10$ was once considered insanity. Btc trading above 100$ was considered preposterous.... etc.. etc.

The data points are established every 10 minutes with a successful block being mined. Network gets hardier, hashrate increases.  If btc were only traded on 3 days, then you'd have 3 data points. 
The price in USD for bitcoins goes up or down, but the issuance of new btc per 10 minutes will go along at the same rate. 12.5, 12.5, 12.5, 12.5 until it halves at 6.25, 6.25..
There is speculation on the value of 1 btc, but bitcoin can not be devalued or inflated arbitrarily the same way modern monetary theory allows with fiat. Central banks turn on the printing press whenever they want. We have to trust that they are printing what they say they are printing. 
Nobody knows what btc is going to do, but realistically the best thing we can hope for is the price comes down so we can accumulate more of them before the halvening.

If you want to diversify you should, but the fear of US declaring war on crypto won't happen. There are too many billionaires who have gotten in already. If this was 2014, then you'd have a better argument. If there's a public event at a country club, go and ask how many people own btc. It's been spreading while everyone debated it's 1000th death, btc was being bought. Hedge funds, banks and other players have been buying.
Look at the politicians, they also own btc now, their kids have been buying btc because many of them heard about it through their millennial children. It's spreading faster than I'd like it to.

The current form works though:
Try to acquire bitcoins for as cheap as possible, and never sell them below the price you buy them at.
So it expands through network effects, and we're still super low in terms of how many people own btc, and those people are obviously motivated to sell them for more than what they bought it for.


Btc fulfills all 4 of Aristotle's principles for money Divisible, Transferable, Durable and Intrinsic Value. 
But it fulfills another huge one too, which has never existed to my knowledge before: limited supply.

* Btc is voluntary, nobody forces you to accept it. This is huge, and glossed over. 
* What is the electricity cost for keeping our current existing banks lit? The electricity criticism is pointed out, but I've never seen what the costs are for running banks, keeping them clean and secure, staffed, water bill, electricity bill, renovations, office furniture, supplies, etc? Maybe the cost of securing the btc network is smaller than the costs of keeping banks afloat?

My lightbulb moment came when I realized even people with a lot of bitcoins want more bitcoins, so the same amount of people every week that want bitcoins is actually increasing. 
Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast has a couple of excellent interviews with Saifedean Ammous @  talking about how all these topics relate to bitcoin.
Bitcoin is superior to any fiat currency, because it's supply is harder to manipulate. As people increasingly come to understand this FOMO like something we've never seen will set in. 
Even if bitcoin goes to 100k i'll still be buying. Why would I not? Fiat currencies are slowly but surely going to 0.

Dude I'm setting up all those people with recurring buys on Gemini.
The mobile app lets you setup recurring buys with your preference for amount and time.
You should do the same. We all should.
For example $10 a week... or $5 a week. Every week, forever no matter what the price is.
A lot of people can't get in psychologically because it feels "volatile". But if you start transitioning into bitcoin in small purchases it's smooth sailing. Plus it will probably help when you see that the dollar amount in your btc account is rising faster than the money in your bank, or your index funds.

Yes the value of crypto currencies is unstable in *dollars* because people are speculating on the value in DOLLARS.
The Fed can never arbitrarily increase or decrease the supply of bitcoins because some banks fucked up with people's money.
See, many people looked at the financial crisis of 2008 and said that the solution was not fair, the rules of the game are written by the banks and for the banks. So we were lucky enough to have Satoshi create a currency that has a steady inflation rate, it's actually so steady it's a flat line for 4 years. 
You can see that here: [
So this whole idea that we need to wait on bated breath to see what the Fed is doing is obsolete. We have a new global, uncorrelated currency that has an inflation rate which can not be tampered with, EVER. The value in this is immense. 
\&gt;The fed only has one job, really: keep inflation in check. And by God they are doing a fantastic job. Compared to any other fiat currency in the world, the US dollar is by far the most stable and inflation-secure.
Because the US dollar has been the world reserve currency for the past century. You are living your life under the assumption it will always be that way. Good luck.

Yeah and many congressmen are actively talking about the future of bitcoin. This doesn't change anything.

If we are past the point that Btc can be stopped then this can't actually harm btc. 
Could it cause 1 random shit state to pass a law making all Btc illegal? 
Perhaps, but goodluck to that state. Also remember bitcoin works, because of the incentives. There will be so many people in that state who own btc calling for that politician's head... the law will either never pass or get overturned eventually.

Unwanted attention of regulators?
Bitcoin has been around for 10 years. They know about it. Everyone who is of any importance in the financial and technology world knows of bitcoin. 
Your wikileaks quote is not exactly relevant anymore. The reason Satoshi didn't want bitcoin associated with wikileaks and begged Assange to not publicize that he accepts btc, was because the network hashrate for btc was absurdly small. Any state actor could flick their finger and 51% attack it. 
We are in a totally different environment in 2019. We had the president of the united states tweet that he didn't like bitcoin. 
Regulators know about bitcoin. They have invested quitely, and publicly they disparage it. I play tennis with many of these regulators.

If you expand the timeline so your granularity isn't so small you'll see that those "friction events" don't even register on the richter scale of bitcoin volatility/adoption/hashrate/whatever.


I see where you're coming from but one of the strengths of bitcoin is we can't go and complain at bitcoin headquarters to the CEO... you can't fine bitcoin itself as you know.
The question you're asking basically has no solution. It's like asking how can I go outside and not be affected by gravitational waves? 
One of the things, you I and the rest of the r/bitcoin community will have to grapple with is bitcoin will start to be talked about by people we disagree with. 
Some people don't like Antonio Brown, and if he suddenly starts saying "bitcoin is a limited supply decentralized cryptocurrency with blocks issued every 10 minutes" it doesn't make the statement less true. 
Some random dictator in Africa starts yelling through the megaphone "DON'T TRUST, VERIFY"... what will we do now? How will we feel as more and more people start to "*get*" it and start talking about btc constantly? 
These are the incentives at work and we have no control. 
It's going to be brutal. How will we feel when Lil Pump releases a song where he's "stacking stats"? 
Part of bitcoin is relinquishing this endless need for control and just letting the network effects play out.

*The LAPD and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) organized response began to come together by midday.

That's fine, you're probably right in trusting the banks.
But maybe you're wrong, and the next news story will be how they manipulated the price of gold. 
My whole point here is not having to trust anymore. Bitcoin is trustless. That's my point.

Buy a trezor or ledger.
I believe the true power of btc is when people own the private keys to their coins.
Which means you are now your own bank.

Thanks for the conspiracy insult, but I think you'll find that a lot of people distrust the financial system because it's inner workings are opaque. Libor, Lehman, Greece, Subprime, Cartels, compounded by the Cantilon Effect and yet somehow the concept that massive institutions with complete control of financial markets can't manipluate the price of gold futures through financial instruments is unlikely?
Thats a declaration of faith in the banks, not even trust. 
I don't have faith in god, faith/trust in the banks or their bullshit monopoly money. 
Don't trust, verify. That's bitcoin.
I want more bitcoins, not more dollars.
