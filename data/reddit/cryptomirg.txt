The whole thing with bitcoin is that it is completely decentralized. Nobody will want a crypto from the government since they would be able to regulate it. They will absolutely try, but will fail in my opinion. Also, I'm not sure if your from the U.S., but if they even tried to ban cryptocurrency the community is large enough to speak out against a ban. The difference between the U.S. banning and China banning is that in the U.S. we would speak out against it but in China making any claims that are negative towards the nations government would land you in a prison most likely.

Well, in simple terms a currency will only go as far as its usability. If companies hop onto bitcoin and other various cryptos (for many, many reasons they will in the future) this becomes a typical currency. What makes it different is the fact that its capped, so no government can step in and deflate the currency by pumping more of it into the economy. As long as people trust and use it, it will keep soaring higher and higher. Of course there will always be those to HODL forever just like people with USD, but they'll make a lot more in the long run than any USD inflation will get you. So, if people value it as real currency it becomes supply and demand.
