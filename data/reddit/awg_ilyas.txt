 doesn't work.
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:15:25
I'm glad in ordered last month. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:59:12
1 ) I did ordered a 30GH in middle of March. Will probably get it in May. 
2) I think it's BFGMiner that got the initial support. They will be handing out devs the ASIC soon.. (I hope) Not sure about Litecoin support, but It'll probably be there. 
Sounds like you got everything thought out. I think it's good. 
@_date: 2013-07-10 02:01:47
I've got a Bitfury + KNC miner group buy shares as well. Seems like those will be hashing sooner than my LS. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:01:27
Will be interested in how much it'll cost.. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:11:33
If you're willing to wait.  The era of GPU mining will end soon. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:07:37
I'm betting at 760 on Gox
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:11:31
My thoughts exactly. Lol. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:49:54
The person at the counter will fill the rest up. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:41:43
And there's a 30k+ sale it seems. o_O
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:05:07
Xmas sale! Wheeeee!
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:18:46
@_date: 2013-06-17 21:43:23
It runs on a Sandy i5. Plus, if you do, you'll need to install Ubuntu on it. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 19:22:16
Sold out? Last post i seen on Bitcointalk they're licensing the design.
@_date: 2013-06-16 14:39:34
Earned : Sold Chromebook Pixel 
Spent: Group mining shares for Bitfury ASIC. + groceries 
Edit: Clarification 
@_date: 2013-07-10 07:52:08
Bitfury. 25Gh/s. Ships August. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:19:33
Me thinks it is. They are just really slow.... 
@_date: 2013-07-12 02:09:32
Gen2 chips? Yes please. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:38:17
A modified Sinatra Fly Me to The Moon?  
@_date: 2013-06-15 19:56:35
Interesting. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:44:15
1) If you're willing to wait (for an eternity). July-Aug if you're order now
2) I'd go direct investment, GPU mining is getting harder. If BFL ships, even more.  
@_date: 2013-06-15 07:57:44
I'll be in man. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:27:55
Pretty much.  You're looking at &gt; 100 kh/s 
You could hook them up to (a) block erupter(s) to mine.
@_date: 2013-07-12 03:28:36
They should. TBH.  And I hope these chips have a higher hash / power ratio. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:58:20
Looks like it's looping for some reason.  In think it's a glitch. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:54:37
30GH/s one when it was around $649. Just before they hiked the price.
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:21:37
Greed. I stopped because I was worried it's going to my head.. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:52:32
They do. Check out Mobile Computer section. Not much of a choice though.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:20:21
3 and 6. Not much options for 4. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 02:39:07
Titanium backup works. It also backs up your app data. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:40:16
Tell that to a guy who actually preordered an ASIC miner. I'll be happy breaking even. Lol. 
That said I'm more of a believer in BTC. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 05:12:32
A 99 order of ~1500 BTC just got gobbled up. o_O 
@_date: 2013-03-15 21:42:27
Would hook it up to a Jalapeño or a Single though.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:40:25
If you can wait that is. Plus. I believe you'll still be able to break even the very least.  
Yes, I ordered a little single in march. 
@_date: 2013-07-09 18:53:02
Frustrating really. TBH, I'd sell my pre-order at a cost to buy more BTC/ Bitfury/KnCMiner. 
@_date: 2013-07-09 11:16:00
Tried it one during Google I/O. Best beta device ever.  But not really worth the $1500. Unless it's your disposable income that is. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 04:19:09
Rather use my GPU though. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:52:50
I have plans on hooking one up with a USB miner /BFL Jalapeño/ BFL little Single. 
@_date: 2013-07-09 11:19:54
Good luck man.  But I feel hoarding and buying group buy shares are the only accessible way to enter.  (Or K1 Nanos)
@_date: 2013-06-24 00:49:17
Cheaper. Good. But ROI is way way to long. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 08:13:24
Just broke 100 USD.  Damn
@_date: 2013-07-10 02:26:14
Ouch. Well at least you're raking some BTC man. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 21:02:58
I sold it for BTC.  lol.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:40:49
BFL is the best( and shady) and the only hope for you to get your hands on an ASIC. 
That Avalon boat sailed a long time ago. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:06:15
And I'm moving to Bitstamp..
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:29:52
Bought 0.5 BTC when 1 BTC was $176
Should've waited.. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:55:25
$40, I bought  0.5 BTC at $176
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:56:07
They said a week. One more week.... 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:59:05
Getting BTC, BitFloor is kinda easy. But you have to bring your cash to a local Bank of America branch. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 14:30:30
Needs Tapatalk support too.. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:51:54
I had a dream that bitcoin broke 800 USD. 
(Actually price on that day was 300+ USD, and then it rose later lol)
Greed, yeah. I had to stop trading on Gox. I can't take it, it was going to my head...
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:04:21
Lol. I know what you mean. I just hope they deliver this time. Minimal proof vid proof + BFGMiner just got a device from them. 
Hopeful, but still skeptical. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 02:33:26
Might wanna open it up, and see what fan is inside. 
I'm thinking of switching it to something a lot more quieter. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:53:03
My exact feeling --&gt; WHERE'S MY MINER BFL?!?!
@_date: 2013-05-08 05:12:39
Interesting. I might just pick up the Avalon chips now. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 05:08:46
I dropped quite a bit on a BTC miner. Crossing my fingers, hoping I can get it on time.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:35:30
Now, it's just the question if you're willing to wait. :/ 
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:40:22
I tried and I said fuck it and gave up. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:58:06
Was on their newsletter: 
I'd pick up two. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:50:04
Same thing is true when mining any resource. 
@_date: 2013-06-19 01:54:16
Dat hashrate. 
@_date: 2013-07-09 20:16:00
March. A bit late into the fray sadly. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:55:44
Well, they are sort of legit.(I still have my doubts they'll deliver on time) And there's no other way of getting any ASICs at all. 
I wanted an Avalon but it's just too expensive. 
@_date: 2013-07-14 22:41:10
Ouch, Chase seems fine with me buying and selling. But I do get like a quarterly wire from my sponsor. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:15:45
I did on some too. :D
I gave them 1 USD worth of BTC if they set up a Blockchain.info  wallet. ( Easiest for the beginner IMO) 
@_date: 2013-07-09 23:59:07
Never again. First and last order and I'll boycott them till the end of time. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:24:29
An "ebay"  sort of thing. I agree. 
I see some Craigslist sellers accepting BTC recently.
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:55:02
Call me crazy, but 1 BTC is kinda a fair price for the 1st gen. 
Wish the Al one wasn't that expensive.  (1.75 BTC  would be nice. :P)  
@_date: 2013-07-12 20:31:38
Prepaid cell service. O_o
