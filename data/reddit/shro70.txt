WTF. Just read the fucking faq . If you need a live support to do such basic operation Bitcoin is not for you.
And stop calling people motherfucker because you are not able to use Google.
Edit. You're a the_donald poster which explain many things.
Your history is hilarious .....and sad.
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:20:33
Use an exchange or le local feature in mycelium.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:08:22
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:16:55
Yep I think you're right.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:32:18
Seriously ? Just check the environmental cost of one transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:41:34
Poloniex .
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:16:18
Yes or reset your device before using it. You should read others stories and you will see hardware wallets are 1000x more secure than storing your coins on a PC , exchange , hpone ...
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:38:33
Actually only 10 15% are lost and in fact I earned more money because I can't access my fund till October.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:31:43
Or  the -45 %  crash killed thé hype.
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:38:49
What did you expect from RT ? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:38:31
Bitstamp . Bitflyer . Poloniex.
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:17:42
And the mempool is at 8000 unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:00:22
Probably a fake binance website. Check your history.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:36:34
Tx id ? Or fud 
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:44:43
Your Reddit history is hilarious. Bye
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:09:47
Maybe search on Google or r/mycelium for similar problem  but I think your problem is the bitcoin's price decreased since the last time you checked your wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:13:20
You drunk ?
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:19:16
And bcash from 3800€ to 1200 €. Remember if bitcoin fail bcash will fail too.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:38:59
Gdax=coinbase. It's an internal transfer.
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:24:46
Seriously ?
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:51:48
Lol. No. When the price of your car go up you still own 1 car. How  can you be in bitcoins without understanding this simple thing.
The value of your bitcoins go up not the amount of bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:37:06
Yep but like many others things like the iPhones price .
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:33:49
You should always create a new seed.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:45:31
No he mine monero. (Cryptonight algo)
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:10:45
No bad idea. Buy a GTX 1060 or 1070 and mine some altcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:14:00
Cash out to pay your taxes.
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:59:01
So you expect Bitcoin will perform better in 9years than bank in 300years ?
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:24:38
Amazon eBay. Just reset the nano s before using it. You can even open it to check the pcb.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:14:09
Because they believe in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:08:31
Set a custom fee of 50 sat/byte.

mtgox: why did you sell your BTC with that guy still holding ~30k in USD?
[Wed Apr 13 23:06:40 2011] mtgox: price is surely going up :)
[Wed Apr 13 23:07:29 2011] Mark Karpelès: yeah, but I don't want to abuse my knowledge of this kind of infos, and anyway those btc were obtained when I sold services on kalyhost with an exchange rate of ~0.9, so I'm back on budget
[Wed Apr 13 23:08:23 2011] mtgox: ah that is honest of you
[Wed Apr 13 23:09:08 2011] Mark Karpelès: if I play the trading platform game, I cannot play the trader game at the same time
[Wed Apr 13 23:09:55 2011] mtgox: I'm sure the people that run the NYSE also trade :)
[Wed Apr 13 23:10:07 2011] Mark Karpelès: :D
[Wed Apr 13 23:10:20 2011] mtgox: but yeah that is the best thing to do is keep them separate
[Wed Apr 13 23:10:33 2011] Mark Karpelès: I'm too lazy for this kind of games anyway
Mtgox = Jed mckaleid
I recommend you to read the whole Skype transcript.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:19:23
I will stop when someone will prove Bitcoin was invented by the us gov. You don't get my point. Go back to the_donald.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:56:48
How ? Which wallet ? Exchange ? ......
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:00:00
Hoping someone will lose "a significant portion of his finances " is not a respectable opinion. You're a piece of shit.
You can hate Bitcoin but let people who believe in it do what they want.
You're a fucking jealous.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:28:02
Not really. The firmware is protected.
Search on Google or ledger website for more infos.

@_date: 2018-01-15 14:45:37
Just wait and next time you should use the segwit address .

No hodl your eth .
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:40:12
Russia today. Ok.....
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:02:15
It can cost 30$ if you have multiple input/output.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:24:40
1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:13:01
Like there is a finite supply of bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:36:31
Stop dreaming Bitcoin will never replace Fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:22:25
Nobody care. Go back to r/buttcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:59:11
You can't mine bitcoin with a GPU or a cpu. You should mine altcoins and be paid in bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:13:19
Yep. I sold some coins near ATH to recover my initial investment so now everything is free money.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:30:24
Check your internet history for a fake binance site.
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:54:25
I think you don't understand what LN is .
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:27:13
No you should control your private keys at the time of the fork.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:33:44
Wow. It seem the concerted effort to push segwit is working.
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:25:55
No. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:16:10
Still not your coins.
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:32:30
Why this guy is still not banned ? Look at his post history.
I prefer to read some bcash shill than this moron.
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:43:24
And free deposit.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:34:28
Compare with r/coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:08:54
Open an account on bitstamp. Buy 5$ of bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:15:20
You can no more earn 80$ from 2$ .
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:26:58

@_date: 2018-01-15 14:46:59
No you will not lose your coins.

Great news but 6 months too late.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:11:47
I hate this guy but he's right.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:53:10
No you need 6 confirmations.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:42:40
430sat/byte is way too high. Try 100 200 but I'm agree fees are too high.
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:05:51
The network /coin is called Bitcoin . The software like in your link is called Bitcoin core.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:01:56
I don't care. I already earned 4000% profit this year.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:34:18
Nah. We should use bigger mail Box.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:35:30

Diversity is the key.
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:23:29
Why people continue to store their life saving on an exchange ?  We are in 2018. Print some paperwallets or buy a hardware wallet.

Ok. I bet in 10 20 years your opinion about banks will change.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:29:18
Wait some hours/day the crisis is not over.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:43:33
Actually there are only 14 offers in BTC. 0 in altcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:21:41
Yep it's called Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:20:53
The hype is over 
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:17:11
Not totally true. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:15:06
The Skype log is incredible.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:45:36
Bitstamp. The besyt exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:10:52
I hope. I will buy a whole Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:30:19
Because cheaper altcoins can raise by 100% a day.
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:54:23
Be careful with dead cat bounce . The correction is not over.
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:21:57

@_date: 2018-01-15 15:21:58
You can use bitstamp too. There is an Android app.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:49:10
Lol no. Your sources (probably Fox news and thedonald) are totally wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:06:14
Ok .thanks. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:42:15
Go back to r/buttcoin idiot. You seem obsessed by Bitcoin ? Let people be scamed or do some profits and get out.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:18:05

@_date: 2018-01-17 14:33:25

European Union.

Just verify your identity and withdraw your coins.
Sorry but before using a service I do some basic research about this service.
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:07:11
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:56:24
Ok Bitcoin was created by the gov to control the world . Just switch to another crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:02:02
Zoom out . Still down trend.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:41:00
Lol. Bch will have the same problem when people will start to use it. And remember if Bitcoin fail bch and others crypto will be impacted too. r/btc bye
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:03:12
 I think the price will bounce back to 13 14 000 then dip to 11 12000
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:26:27
Low. 5 7 sat
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:38:50
Take a 200 000€ loan to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:37:48
Futures contracts will kill the crypto's market like with gold.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:08:02
You should always diversify your investment. Never put more than 15 20 in high volatile asset like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:39:11
Sadly exchanges are the key in everything with bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:39:10
Happy new year and thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:01:26
So now a mempool with 100 000 unconfirmed transactions is normal ? Bitcoin is definitely dead.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:45:06
Source  ?  Proof  ? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:54:43

No he is a liar
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:53:28
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:55:08
Or people that hodl 80% and maximize their profits in altcoins with the 20%
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:40:52
0 risk.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:03:46
No and i use bitstamp since May.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:16:15
Bull trap.

Seriously ? Pretty safe ? Lol

Don't use the mineegate software.  They will steal you a % of your mining power. Use a 3rd party miner.

Hahahaha. I'm actually watching this episode.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:19:04

@_date: 2018-01-19 14:52:06
Coinbase will kill Bitcoin. Coinbase will fail this year so be prepared to a Bitcoin at 300$
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:59:32
Sorry but Bitcoin is not for you if you can't do ultra basic maths.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:46:46
There are great Americans people but the US government suck. The us government is responsible of milions deaths all over the world. The us gov used the nuclear bomb. The us gov founded drugs cartel. The us gov perpetrated terrorist attack . Wikipedia is full of shit the USA gov did.
So yeah fuck the USA even if Bitcoin is an American invention.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:47:44
So you believe in the pizza ring ?
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:10:22
Europe will never switch to Bitcoin as official currency. Maybe a cryptoeuro yes.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:00:58
r/BTC say it cost 10$ . Lol

@_date: 2018-01-09 12:41:37
Who care ? Nobody control it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:07:03
I can wait few years so I don't care.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:25:36
Are you serious. Atheist are probably more ethical than religious.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:49:17
You can acheive a cashless society without crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:53:24
Fees are not calculated with the amount of bitcoins you send but of the transaction's size.
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:43:54
Bad news for a privacy oriented coin. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:45:12
Not necessarily. Bitcoin cash is just a big sub too.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:16:59
Bcash has the Bitcoin name and powerfull backers so sadly I think they will succeed.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:03:54
Exactly . With people like him the totalitarism is close.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:42:04
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:08:44
Simply  the better exchange in the world.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:25:12
You should delete your mobile number in secondary backup and use printed codes.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:12:48
No. Like Elon musk is not Satoshi.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:11:37
Such attack will crash to hell the value of bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:32:25
Even with segwit and ln coinbase will continue to steal money from users with higher fees than others exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:36:57
100 % SCAM
"Earn compoundable passive 5-6% income paid daily." Lol
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:19:19
And burn money. You can't earn money by mining on phone. Only few hash /s so even with monero or others altcoins you lose money.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:07:59
Jealous.  Go to bed.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:59:39
Press F8 or F12 when you boot . Maybe try to reinstall bitkey on your USB key with linuxlivecdcreator, unebootin or xboot.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:45:55
What 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:40:18
Not 100% but 58% which is really big.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:48:33
Thanks u/DogerVer . That's really funny.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:21:33
Yep. First rule is to never click on ads .
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:17:40
You can pay lower fee . Just stop using shitty service.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:24:14
I never sell at loss so.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:29:11
I think you don't understand the purpose of 2FA.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:52:17
Stop using coinbase. The worst exchange to buy bitcoins .
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:46:22
Satoshi's 1 milions bitcoins are used to prove the security of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:12:25
Sorry but who will do such stupid thing ?
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:48:47
The community.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:29:55
First rule is to never click on ads. Come on folks we are in 2018 and people continue to lose money with stupid scam .
 I can't be sorry.
When you play whith 40 000. You do some research.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:01:30
So pay your rent and hodl your 0.067 BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:15:29
With binance you don't control your private keys so you will have forked coins only if binance accept to give you the coins.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:48:14
A little bit too childish.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:32:40
Ont only bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:40:15
Lol. Go back to iceposeidon sub with your fake coins.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:11:50
It's just a wallet not necessarily a wallet on a website. Can be a paper or hardware wallet.
Can you explain the hack please ?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:10:31
Lol. You don't understand what is Bitcoin so shut up .Bitcoin is not dead. 
"And if you buy something for the only reason that you hope someone else will be paying more than you did - you are participating in a financial bubble and a pyramid scheme that sooner or later will collapse."
Same as buying stock or gold.
See you later this year ! But learn more about what is really Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-02 12:54:52
Great news.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:37:42
Not really. The firmware is designed to check the integrity of the ledger. 
You can buy it from Amazon if you reset the seed.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:53:51
Yep. The real land of the free.

If the price is not affected by the fee's problem ,there is a big big problem. That mean we're in a bubble.

@_date: 2018-01-22 16:58:17
You can use this same key or use a new for each transaction.

@_date: 2018-01-11 19:32:12
"the only place I've stored the seed and password for the encryption is on my EverNote account " how your Evernote account is protected ? 
You should never store your seed or password on your computer or phone.

Go to r/sorryforyourloss sub and read some stories.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:38:07
search about btc-e ? FBI raided btc-e server.
People were able to claim 85% of their fund only because btc-e is a good company.
Now search mtgox,cryptsy ....
Why using censorship resistance currency if you store your money in an exchange which can be shutdown or stolen.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:54:16
Never use margin trading with cryptos.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:35:21
LN is a 2nd layer solution. The main blockchain will continue to be used.

@_date: 2018-01-15 15:15:37
Storing 32 BTC in coinbase is pretty dumb. I hope your opsec is good.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:33:14
The coins are taged now so ....
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:23:38
No you can send from a non segwit wallet to a segwit wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:44:23
Yep I'm agree. Bitcoin should be more eco-friendly.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:26:05
No. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:52:28
That's exactly why I continue to invest in gold and silver.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:42:51
Gdax is coinbase. Use bitstamp or gemini.

 You don't even understand how Bitcoin work.
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:19:43
Yep if you send 180 000 you will trigger some KYC alert.
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:46:22
Segwit is a big change in the code. Not really easy to implement.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:06:44
No you should use the authy app or backup the 2fa secret key when you register on a website.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:21:25
Do you have 2 fa on your email account too ?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:00:39
European Union will regulate crypto in 2018.

@_date: 2018-01-02 17:40:45
Yes you can but let your coins on an exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:52:42
Lol . Only 3 developers out of 700 work for blockstream. What a joke. Go back to r/BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:12:03
You should split your coins between 3 4 paper wallet. Don't forget to do backup too.
You should never store all your coins in only 1 wallet.
And generaate your wallet on an offline linux live cd
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:07:49
Yep but if your transaction is complex with many in/out you will pay more than 10$.
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:54:01
And kill bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:38:29
Many exchange ask to verify only to withdraw Fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:19:12

You don't know what is socialism. You're a crazy libertarian. People like you will destroy our society.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:40:14
Not if you let your coins on an exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:41:48
He's wrong. You can buy 5$ in an exchange . Just don't transfer the coins to another wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:33:15
Always initialize a new seed. 
Why nobody read the fucking FAQ 
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:06:31

@_date: 2018-01-15 21:13:23
Cryptos are still in beta .
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:07:44
No because how Pablo can cash out 1 bilions dollar  in bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:59:50
If you want anonymity with Bitcoin you should sell Bitcoin to monero then transfer monero between 2 3 wallets and buy Bitcoin with monero. 
"The idea so far is to give full ID first to buy BTC then send it to offline generated adresses and mix transaction 3 of 4 times between various wallets, " will litteraly be totally useless. Someone will still be able to track your coins from gdax to your wallet with a simple blockeplorer.
Maybe try to use mixer on the darkweb like helix.
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:37:07
Yep or using decentralized exchange like bisq.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:12:45
Hodl .
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:20:40
To be fair even with lightning a block size increase will be necessary to settle the channels.

No it's just really difficult to know how much taxes you should pay. I trade on bittrex,poloniex,bitfinex,bitstamp,wex a lot of altcoins and Bitcoin. Not easy to do the maths even with tools like cointracking.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:14:52
Your friend is an idiot. Show him others exchanges do free withdrawal too.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:37:32

Ledger nano s. Support many altcoins. Check their website.
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:37:47
Use an exchange like bitstamp or gemini. Fees are 0.25%
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:23:56
One more pro or the  crypto market will  continue to grow
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:44:54
Because GPU are more powerfull so why using a less powerfull CPU when you can use a GPU.
Well to be fair my old CPU I 2600k at 4.5 GHz has the same performance than my old gtx570 so I use the 2 . 350h/s +350h/s with XMR or ETN.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:16:12

What will be the cost of running a lightning node ?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:00:50

Yep and buy the dip each time.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:04:04

@_date: 2017-12-19 09:22:14
You can transfer 2 BTC for 5$ actually.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:49:44
Use coinomi or mycelium
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:29:38
Yep like gridcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:44:31
Which wallet ? If you use breadwallet, coinomi, mycelium,electrum .... You own your private key and your bitcoins.
Just backup the wallet seed like all people do.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:50:49
Well actually even with segwit the fee is high with a clogged mempool 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:12:24

Because you watch and read stupid things.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:58:11

Lol. What a joke. You can have 100 Satoshi by simply using a faucet.
Sorry for your loss.
I can sell your 200 Satoshi for 25 $ ? Ok ?
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:47:10
Why ? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:18:20
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:22:12
You can't . It's gone.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:41:48
Ok go back to r/BTC and let us with our shitty high fees coin. Bye
And FYI fees of 20sat work nice actually.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:27:11
"You can send a Segwit Tx if the receiving address is a Segwit address. The sending wallet does not need to be Segwit" ?
I think the sending address should be segwit to reduce the size of the transaction and the fee, not the receiving one.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:40:55
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:19:55
200 000 actually 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:01:02
It's just a small crash .
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:51:03
Bitcoin can't be stopped. The  price yes. The current bitcoin's economy .  But even if Bitcoin is banned worldwide some peoples will continue to use it .(darknet...)

You should modify your email password and add 2fa to your email account too.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:52:21
The network bandwidth is the problem like the time to validate data before new block.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:53:14
Yes 200 000 unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:22:22
What ?
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:13:43
Only on wex.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:10:39
Ok but it's not because Bitcoin has crashed 6 times and recovered it will do it again.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:12:40
Because coinbase is the worst place to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:06:46
Yep because you're a troll.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:15:30

Do your gold in your basement change value as gold price rise ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:56:47
No. Import your seed in a wallet like mycelium on Android.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:08:04
Bitcoin will be dead in 18 months.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:59:07
Yep. I use moonbitcoin , moonlitecoin .....
I do it in case a day 1 Satoshi = 1 dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:37:10
No really ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:48:01

By looking at the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:28:27
Only 15%
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:28:59
Or maybe a lot of people like  with transactions stuck since weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:43:03
Stop using this shitty service. Coinbase is one of the worst place to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:32:50
Yes. Just stop using this shitty service.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:09:00
Use this tool 
With 11 words I think you can recover it easily.
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:27:31
I put limit buy orders with 350$ step so I can buy the dip with dollar cost average strategy.
15000 &gt; 14650 &gt; 14300 &gt; 13950 ......
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:25:05
No. Cloud mining is a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:40:32
Lol. What you will say when Bitcoin will lost 50% in one day ?
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:48:11
No only for people smarter than you.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:29:49
The average Joe is an idiot.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:58:22
Hodl 85% of your bitcoins and play with the others 15%
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:18:48
So 50 000 unconfirmed transactions today
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:05:19
No. The mempool is full.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:02:45
Try to use winminer. You can earn 2 $ a day.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:02:19
Dollar cost average on the dip. I put limit order each 400$ drop.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:43:42
So you invest in bitcoins without knowing how to sell ?
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:23:38
Use a better wallet and set a custom fee.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:07:04
Ask why he is still free and not in jail.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:54:41
You can't claim forked coins if your coins are on coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:36:19
Nobody care about the fork. B2x is a scam coin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:52:07
No . Too late. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:06:30
Scam . You will lose money.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:12:02
And they're in love with evil bitfinex
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:17:11
"I am an expert after i spent an entire night researching" hahaha.
r/buttcoin is for you.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:26:17
Yes for 100$ .
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:38:16
I think we are between the greed and delusion in the mania phase. Or maybe already in delusion .
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:31:12
With mycelium you can send transaction with 3 sat/byte so you are a liar.
When you change the fee you should reselect the amount of Btc to send ( max button)
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:19:29
Totally agree.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:46:25
100% a scam. The security expert is the scammer or a friend of the scammer. 
How in 2017/2018 people continue to believe in low effort scam like this one ?
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:18:06
If you are scared by a 500$ drop Bitcoin is not for you. A day Bitcoin will probably lose 5000$ a day.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:13:21
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:11:23
Yep but there are 40 000 unconfirmed transactions with 0 to 20 sat/bytes
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:41:41
Start by researching about Bitcoin before posting ? Seem logical isn't it ?
I will not start posting about overwatch without playing it and learning about.

So I will lose the 0.046$ I have on kraken?
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:20:41
No buy more
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:20:14
The problem is not the nano but gatehub.
The sending address should be segwit not the receiving one to pay less fee.
Ask gate hub .
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:04:26
Like lightning node .
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:31:39
Maybe he want to claim forked coins or he is an idiot .
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:07:30
You can't. You should withdraw your coins from coinbase to a wallet which let you control your private keys.
Eg mycelium , breadwallet, electrum....
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:10:39
Lost word ? I'm right ?
Send only 1 to me .

@_date: 2017-12-13 17:11:20
They will steal inactive forked bitcoins not actual Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-05 21:54:18
Use a better exchange with free bitcoin withdrawal like bitstamp. I can withdraw even low amount like 0.0005 BTC to my hardware wallet for free.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:10:13
And 250 000 unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:27:02
Why people continue to use coinbase ? Use bitstamp or gemini.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:27:51
Because the satoshis coins are still in his wallet.

WTF. For 800 000 $ I take a plane or do a wire transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:48:22
Bitstamp which use segwit since September.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:52:36
You can do the same with a ledger nano S.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:27:40
Always diversify your investment. I believe in BTC but own eth, LTC, bch, xrp,iota,str,game,dash .... And gold/silver/stock.
And Reddit is only a tiny part of the Bitcoin community. Go to bitcointalk for serious reading.

Thanks to coinbase you can buy more bitcoins at a lower price.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:52:00

So you missed the ship ? 
Bitcoin will crash but will recover .
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:48:57
Lol no. Gdax is coinbase so using gdax support coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:36:23
Netwok issue + coinbase being the worst place to buy Bitcoin .

You can even read primecoin in your screenshot under account option.
Actually 1 prime coin cost 0.42$ so......
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:55:21
Ok but the competitors can cooperate . It happen all time with big company.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:09:51

I think and i hope you're a liar.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:42:26

Ripple , Bitcoin and Ethereum yes iota not actually.
A ledger nano S cost 80$ so for a low amount just use mycelium and coinomi on Android.

You should use bitstamp which is based in Luxembourg and use segwit since months. I can't understand europeans using coinbase or others us based exchange when there are better solution here.

Yes probably. Extract the hard drive then connect it on another computer, you should search for a wallet.dat.

Wow. First rule is to diversify your portfolio.

Sorry but you're the only one to have a problem. Peoples spend theirs paperwallets every time without issue.
I have 5 papers wallets. I use mycelium (my seed is written on a paper too) to import my fund from my paperwallet to send to an exchange to sell my coins. What's the problem.
If I want to send some coins from the exchange to a paper wallet I create a new paper wallet or send to an old one.
Than make sense for anyone except you. Maybe you're the problem.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:03:05
So the world of Satoshi is a world where you pay for each search on Google ?

@_date: 2017-12-09 08:28:47
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:11:46
No but it can help in short term trading. You can use MACD and AO indicator with good result.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:38:20
Just reset it and create a new seed.

Or in the freezer between two pizzas.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:04:29
No it's not a problem. Everybody say you should backup your seed when you use a wallet so your mycelium seed is safe.
It's also recommended to sweep the entire amount of your paperwallet .

You can send to a segwit address. I do it everytime I send to bitstamp segwit.

If coinbase is insolvent Bitcoin will crash to 500$ or less.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:46:12
No. I think Bitcoin will crash hard in 2018
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:28:06

What a fucking moron. I can't be sorry
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:21:40
Stop spamming with this non-issue. 
People who "learned about the importance of backing uo their private keys" will backup the seed of the software/wallet they use to import their paperwallets.
Find me some proof someone has lost money with this problem.( And not the 2010 post)
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:26:07

@_date: 2017-12-27 23:56:34
So you hacked someone and want our help ? Nice try.
"I lost access/don't know the phone number Coinbase is using for SMS 2FA because I was using one of those free phone number apps."

Bitstamp is not a wallet. It's an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:01:47

Best investment ever. You will not regret it even if Bitcoin reach 100 000
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:48:19
Use a segwit wallet and set custom fee. Actually 2 to 5 $ .
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:16:47
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:25:31
Wow. What a shame. You can withdraw for free on bitstamp.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:07:26
Crypto is only in beta stage.
Funny to compare Enron to a whole industry all over the world.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:59:06
Off course you can use coinomi to spend your Bitcoins you can even set custom fees.
Coinomi is a multicurrencies wallet with integrated exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:17:55
Or you can use others serious exchanges like bitstamp, gemini, kraken ....
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:21:12
80% not even know what is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:18:42
If you can't do basic math don't invest or trade  BTC.
@_date: 2018-09-07 18:32:30
Like today.
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:38:51
You sell your paper wallet or privatekeys  or password to someone. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:12:22
Useless and childish
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:12:59
Even with segwit coinbase will charge crazy fee. Mark my words.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:02:09

Just backup the seed of the software wallet you use.  What is the problem ?
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:15:24
Nobody care about the storage space. The network bandwidth is a problem
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:24:27

@_date: 2017-12-17 22:13:23

@_date: 2017-12-20 23:03:40
Because they are paid by AXA and want to kill Bitcoin. 's or not 's ?
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:25:58
Use a better exchange like bitstamp. Sepa transfer are free and you will pay only 0.25% to buy bitcoins.
You can trade in bitstamp too.
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:27:22

This is exactly why I continue to do use faucets now even if I buy bitcoins too.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:52:05
No it's a great news. A taxable Bitcoin is better than a banned Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:35:32

Lol. Ok go back to r/BTC.
@_date: 2018-09-27 13:41:43
Bitstamp is actually the best exchange and they're based in Europe.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:09:28
The coins are transfered to your mobile or software wallet so you can eat the paperwallet now.
And why it's so difficult to backup the seed of the wallet you use ?
Check Reddit, mycelium sub or bitcointalk nobody is confused .

It's called a stop loss order.
If you don't know what is a stop loss order don't do it . Especially on a crazy market like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:08:09
Bitcoin will evolve to be quantum computing resistant.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:16:21

" However, in a strange twist, instead of moving the physical gold to Istanbul as the Turkish press reported in April, the Swiss newspaper notes that around 19 tons of Turkish gold is now stored at the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements.
It was not immediately clear why Turkey would shift its gold from the NY Fed to the BIS, whose historical "gold rehypothecation" tendencies have been well documented over the years.

@_date: 2017-11-09 03:51:04
Yes. That's why Bitcoin cash supporter think bch is the real Bitcoin. I should say actually they're not wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:03:35
Not a problem. You can hold few hundreds $ in mycelium it's safe. Just don't do stupid things with your phone and backup your seed. Ah and use a pin code.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:32:54
Stop using coinbase. Use bitstamp especially if you live in Europe. Do a sepa transfer to bitstamp it's free.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:26:04

That sucks but only few peoples are concerned. 
No problem with my wex account. I have withdrawn my coins and Fiat so only my tokens stay in WEX.
Only people with suspended account seem to be affected.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:59:01
Miners and devs can run 1000's nodes if they want like with the b2x story.

A new forum software.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:56:02
So fee at 40 100$ are really bad.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:50:41
Yep. Withdrawn my last € from kraken last week.
Since btc-e each time I see a ssl25 error I withdraw everything
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:44:08

@_date: 2017-11-19 23:47:47
Wtf. It's just a screenshot.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:56:10
Use a faucet.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:59:21
BITSTAMP based in Luxembourg
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:45:47
You're right.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:32:37
Username don't checkout.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:38:19
You import or sweep your private key in a software wallet like mycelium ,electrum ....
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:09:14
Who is this guy ?
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:11:27
Roger vers lol and the miners need to restart theirs rigs to stop signaling s2x . Wait 2 or 5days and you will see the support disappear.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:43:02
Monero xmr 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:08:04
Be patient crash will happen quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:11:29
Wow. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:36:47
Because the market has anticipated this event.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:20:03
Use virtual keyboard.
Edit : "Updated, 11/7/2017, 8:40am PT: An earlier version of the article stated that the keyboard's software was sending key presses. However, in a closer look, it seems that the Cloud Driver software doesn't send the key presses to the Alibaba server but only how many times each key has been pressed. "
So probably nothing dangerous.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:39:05
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:38:50
Who care ?
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:34:02
Same problem but only when I try to send 1 sat/byte transaction
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:09:00
Use 3rd party miner.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:07:03
Next time use authy and backup your code.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:00:07
No more free 2x coins + money flowing from BTC to altcoins = small crash or at least a  correction
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:57:48
Lol . Paying 100$ to store 500$.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:58:46
21milions + 21 milions bcash + 21 milions bgold + ......
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:27:39
Simply use coinomi. Worked great with bcash , seem to work with bgold and will probably work with b2x.
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:27:22
You can't be serious.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:33:59
Bitstamp. A Luxembourg based exchange. Simply the best.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:37:42
It's a bank transfer problem not a mempool problem.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:11:50
Definitely a scam. Why not directly buying Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:36:27
He was just the final nail in the B2X coffin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:49:40
No 12 word pass phrase = no Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-08 18:02:34
99$ now
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:28:26
Next time use a real exchange. An european based exchange : BITSTAMP.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:36:54
Why they ask Bitcoin and not monero ?
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:55:35
Bitstamp. Based in Luxembourg.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:10:13
They will not add Bitcoin with the actual fee problem.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:27:45
Use a better exchange like gemini or coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:14:00
Why ? BTC-e is back since 2 months.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:28:52
Actually Bitcoin can't be used as a currency. Fees too high.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:57:43
"They made me believe that it was a machine used by Revenue Canada to transfer money quickly," 
How people can fall in scam Ile that in 2017 .
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:35:32
I always let somes orders at extremely low prices one time 1 was confirmed at 342$ when the price was 3420. My best day.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:36:29
It's the same chain.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:49:48
Source or proof ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:38:12
In the app.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:54:05
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:11:00
Printed paper wallet with bip38 password.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:36:08
Never put your private key/seed phrase on the web. 
Write it on a paper then laminate the paper and hide the papers in different locations.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:40:34
Stop using this shitty service.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:29:09
Buy on coinbase , withdraw to quadrigacx then sell here.
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:17:54

Use bitstamp. Us based exchange can be shut down quickly. Never trust the USA.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:57:18
Yep but you can still sell your 10m $ Bitcoin and let your Fiat in your exchange account t
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:47:39
So after one year on this subreddit you still don't know how to buy and store bitcoins ?
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:57:05
Use this livecd : bitkey.io.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:04:08
US gov can kill Bitcoin in USA. Bitcoin will continue in the free world.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:34:16
Big crash. 7800e on bitstamp.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:35:42
It's ETH not BTC .
This story is crazy. A newbie Dev kill 300m$ smart contracts. He is already famous.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:26:45
Use bitstamp ( based in Luxembourg) . Send a sepa transfer. It's free
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:34:05
You will probably lose 500$
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:39:04
Correction is not over. Asian market will continue to crash the price
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:54:33
Totally agree.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:49:30
A little too optimistic.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:29:22
 You can buy  or sell something for 1/ 50000 BTC or even 1 Satoshi . What's the problem ?
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:26:23
Because coinbase suck.
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:37:42
I will never understand people like you.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:25:31
Never buy in only a while time. I put limit order by 70$ step .
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:22:16
I start to think bch supporters are right.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:08:57
What ? You earned 10 000 for sweeping a bch wallet in coinomi ? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:44:37
Great news. We should stop using centralized exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:35:24
Kraken down then coinbase down. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:14:08
Yep. Ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:57:26
A lot but they work in Western countries
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:37:57
They can temporary block BTC by blocking the ports'
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:35:01
Bitstamp use segwit.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:23:18
Another devops in bittrex.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:10:59
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:25:15
Wrong. Actually ou can send your 20$ or 200000 with a 50 to 80sat/byte  fee . Thanks Roger and jihan for higher fees.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:19:11
Try bitkey.io before. All my printers are supported.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:06:04
Use their api next time.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:41:50
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:45:34
They pay the exchange fee . Probably 0.2%
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:11:17
Really bad idea.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:26:46
Mining contract = SCAM
Mining contract on eBay = 2x SCAM
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:38:35
Dollar cost average. Buy a little now , a little the next dip .......
I put 20€ orders each 200$ step.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:43:12
Lol no.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:44:43
Who is behind censorship notifier account ?
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:06:27
Just use the seed phrase.

Look at others markets with futures.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:04:04

True. I post  and nobody will see it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:40:24
Your coin are stored on the blockchain not on your paper so yes you will have the altcoins.

@_date: 2017-11-08 17:33:06
8000 today.
S2X is dead but we need to address the high fees issue. Time to miners to widely adopt segwit now.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:03:30
Change bank. Use bitstamp.
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:11:57

Europian ?
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:07:46
Yes safe.
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:44:08
Just buy more coins when the price crash.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:07:42
Just do multiple paper wallet + multiple copies and use your 100$ to buy more bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:08:06
Of course it's free on another exchange / wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:18:53
Wow. It's ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:20:59
you can use this tool. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:08:43
Lol. 100 dollars = 87 euros actually.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:05:06
The problem is not the storage space but the network bandwidth.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:17:57
Of course you can. Trading fees are 0.25 on bitstamp . Deposit + withdrawal are free 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:13:46
Yep. Bitcoin was designed as a peep to peer cash system not a digital gold.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:53:14
And some people continue to think Bitcoin is not in a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:32:50
Nice try.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:04:03

@_date: 2017-11-08 20:53:45
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:22:22
Yep and buy a  machine to laminate at 30$ 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:14:56
Exactly what I predicted 2 months ago.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:52:50
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:04:04
Why ? Ledger say it's okay.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:35:54
Yep. They pump the BTC price with freshly printed tether then sell bitcoins to stay solvable.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:09:29
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:33:38
Exactly why buying with a shady site when you can buy on Amazon, Newegg or even your local resseler..
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:26:51
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:57:13
Use a real exchange like bitstamp with free withdrawal
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:12:56
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:11:58
No. 20 to 50 sat/byte will work.
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:22:35
Yep using PayPal to buy a Bitcoin hardware wallet is totally ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:28:48
Bitstamp sepa transfers are free.

@_date: 2017-11-30 00:24:36
Yep. All us based exchange suck.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:19:06
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:46:15
Bitcoin will rise to 18000 then crash really hard to 4000.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:23:53
Victory day now.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:24:46
Bitcoin and bcash should work together. Bch to buy stuff and Bitcoin as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:14:38
Actually 20 sat/byte will confirm quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:05:07

@_date: 2017-11-02 19:49:17
It's reddit not bitcointalk .
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:24:03
Just use this tool offline.

Can I pay an escort with Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:51:36
Yeah 10 000 20 000 with 100$ fees
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:12:36
Stop using coinbase. Use bitstamp especially if you're from Europe. Sepa transfers are free.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:28:00
Your coins are on the blockchain not in your wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:24:07
Great news but i think you should be verified to do it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:57:04
Why using crypto currency when gov can just push us to use digital Fiat ?
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:52:48
Bitfinex 2x future owners are definitely fucked.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:43:00
Yep 20 000 to 45 000 in few hours.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:22:27

@_date: 2017-11-22 20:44:08
And some people say let the market regulate itself. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:54:49
Why ? Just use a bip38 password.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:04:23
In your dream.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:39:47
You can't be serious.

Free market without any regulations isn't totally free.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:51:10
Micro SD slot is not a great idea. Can be a vector of attack.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:17:02

@_date: 2017-11-16 00:19:06
Kraken is dying. Time to save your life.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:22:01
And its' gone. Sorry.
Bitcoin will never be mainstream because story like this.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:39:57
Even 40 will work 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:07:26
Yep and 90% I'd people in the chatbox are admin or bots.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:08:44
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:59:24
Are you serious ? So now Bitcoin is only for rich people in the west ?
Where is the peer to peer cash system.
People like you let me think maybe bcash supporters are right.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:42:17
Same question was asked 4 times today.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:48:53
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:31:43
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:12:59
You should use an Android app like mycelium .
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:54:44
Yes. I try to withdraw some dashcoin without success. I will never use kraken.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:27:21
Yep big problem. When tether will crash or disappear Bitcoin will crash very hard.
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:25:28
WTF. Learn more about how bcash work.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:57:12
No. Use a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:51:04
On exchange which will support BTC and b2x.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:42:23
Sorry but Nvidia card outperform AMD card with xmr.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:44:38
In coinomi you don't import a wallet but sweep it into your existing wallet. Try asking at r/coinomi or open a support ticket.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:02:58
Never use 2FA by sms. Only use authy app and please use 2fa on your email account too.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:20:04
I believe in Bitcoin but the actual price is crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:30:49
Bitcoin ATMs will be the first thing the gov will ban.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:37:50
Be careful when using tails and tor. There are exit node sniffing for credentials.
Tails is good for anonymity but not for security.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:25:50
That work but can't be mainstream
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:03:47
Send it back to the address which send you the BTC.

Edit : wow 25 $ fee with 19in  1 out. Ouch.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:56:09
Exactly. Paper wallet are really good. People here want you spend 100$ in an hardware wallet even if you own only 200$ Bitcoin. Ridiculous.
Do multiple paper wallets with multiple copies. Laminate them. You're fine
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:25:51
Whith your nickname what do you think of AXA (bilderberg) owning blockstream ?
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:46:05
Use bitstamp. A great exchange. Send a first deposit of 3 400 $ then another 10 000 then another 10 000
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:21:45
People start killing themselves.

Why ? Fiat do what you propose for Bitcoin .
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:34:42

@_date: 2017-11-09 21:18:33
The moon is already here. 8000$ for a crypto with 50000 unconfirmed transactions. Not bad after all !
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:10:04
Try to mine monero on minergate or nicehash. I think you can earn 2$ a day with your system.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:50:23
Use a real exchange like bitstamp with 0 fee on withdrawal.
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:46:12
Replace desktop wallet by mobile wallet.

@_date: 2017-11-24 00:24:10
Not true. There are 20 000 1-5 sat/b unconfirmed transactions.
But with 15 30 sat/b ok.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:26:46
Why ? Best idea is to use tails or bitkey.io to download the page to create the paperwallet . Put it on an USB key restart offline on tails or bitkey.io and print it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:36:13

@_date: 2017-11-08 00:58:54
So use a real wallet or a better exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:52:04
Will use coinomi.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:47:00
Totally unrelated or related in the sense bitcoins price reflect country instability.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:22:06
Use litecoin for transfer and Bitcoin as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:07:00
Incredible some people use Bitcoin !
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:16:14
If you panic for 25£ . You should sell your BTC and stop Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:58:12
If the computer running electrum is connected to internet it's not offline.
To be really offline you can print a paper wallet.

@_date: 2017-11-10 13:05:31
Thanks . Great documentary.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:58:59
Not actually true. Others altcoins have a better technology.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:07:43
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:07:27
Still true. When an event happen . Bitcoin is unusable.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:52:33
Yes. Monero , zcash vertcoin...
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:53:02
You should mine with a pool. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:12:36
Yep. It's a big problem.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:01:44
Yep. Crazy. One more proof we are in a bubble .
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:37:46
Lol. This guy try to show he did nothing wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:26:27
Why ? He killed ETH smart contracts not BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:13:59
No. Buy Bitcoin or invest in mining altcoin
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:01:22
China is already a superpower.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:05:13
And ?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:31:43
How people can do such stupid choices.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:07:56
It's free.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:59:19
You should use 2fa on your email account too. 2FA only on exchanges is useless now.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:02:20
FAKE. He just want to avoid irs.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:53:47
If Bitcoin go to 100000 I will be happy and if Bitcoin crash to 1000 I will be happy to buy more btc's.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:48:08
No. Blochain technology is like tcp/ip
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:25:43
No gov . Yeah. We know what happen without some regulations. Ex firearms.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:49:43
Ridiculous. Maybe in 15 years yes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:35:45
By sending you a transaction to refund you .
What What would prevent a rogue store manager, employee, or anybody that has access to the stores to steal the cash like today ?
But personaly I think Bitcoin will never replace Fiat they will coexist.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:21:27
Mycelium will add segwit in few weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:15:39
It's a SCAM and you post using cubit to earn more money. Fuck.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:50:01
Source or proof ?
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:42:01
If you want to trade on poloniex with your Android phone use tabtrader and setup api-keys in your polo account. Think to remove withdrawal authorization too.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:27:11
Use a real exchange with 0 withdrawal fee like bitstamp.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:46:24
Not true. There are legit altcoins mobile miner.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:26:35
Exactly what I did with my gold and my paperwallet.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:06:07
Bitcoin wisdom is in free wheel since months.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:04:49
Bitstamp or gemini.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:54:55
Transaction size 7484 (octets)
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:21:57
Say that to people actually trying to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:40:19
Hahaha. What a joke.
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:43:05
Great idea if you're a prostitute.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:20:51
Bitstamp. An europe based exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:07:12
Maybe you should read this sub a little before posting.
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:36:37
yep thx S2x. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:07:53
We can't wait LN. Fees are killing Bitcoin actually.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:25:12
Even with 2fa if your email is compromised they can gain access to your account. Enable 2fa on email too
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:47:28
Use a real wallet like mycelium or samouraï. Stop using coinbase with their ridiculous fees.
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:36:37
No. Same cost. My Bitcoin and gold are in a Tupperware in my garden.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:15:15
20 to 60 sat/byte
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:16:36
Only if coinomi add support.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:31:48
But btc1 futures are currently 6100 so Btc1 futures + B2X futures = actual BTC price.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:43:05
Not true. I do some surveys on btcmoon . They send the reward to coinpot and the withdrawal is free.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:21:52
Because fees.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:35:47
Price will crash . See the ALTCOINS chart.
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:21:40
Coinbase will never give your diamonds. Next time you should control your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:31:35
Yubikey  is just a 2 FA tool. Not a place to store your Bitcoins .
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:30:14
Segwit and segwit2x is not the same thing. Let your coins in the segwit wallet. Both segwit and legacy are the real Bitcoin chain.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:58:12
Thanks to this guy. LTC is going to moon.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:05:56

Paper wallet in my garden,house etc....
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:38:48
Oh. I will close my uphold account. ( Only 500e)
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:30:43
"can move it cheaply, quickly, and without asking permission."  
Well actually Bitcoin is great as a store of value but failed his initial purpose: a peer to peer cash currency.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:10:18
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:08:23
Do math.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:12:30
Nothing. Only 3 6 bitcoins traded per day in Zimbabwe.
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:10:20
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:56:46
Scam. A beautiful one.
Your email is probably hacked. Activate 2 FA on it too.
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:08:22
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:50:55
Bad idea. Your cryptés volume Can fail or be corrupted. Look at r/sorryforyourloss
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:59:40
Never let your coins on an exchange and never use Windows to store your coins.
Use paper wallet or hardware wallet as cold wallet and a good phone app like mycelium as hot wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:47:30
Why this lol ?
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:19:15

@_date: 2017-11-22 20:31:34
Only the deposit and withdrawal are on chain.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:48:29
Actually it will take some days. The mempool is full of very low tx fees.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:08:54
Hahaha. Great story. 
Now replace goat by Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:24:36

@_date: 2017-10-12 09:29:08
For bitfinex yes but coinbase we don't know.
"Bitcoin exchange Coinbase has also announced it will support both blockchains following the fork. However, Coinbase — a SegWit2x supporter — has not revealed what labels and tickers it will apply to each chain."
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:58:51
A paper wallet 
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:58:26
A little too late m8 but you can withdraw your coin without problem. Just trade your dollar to BTC and withdraw now.

Big dip in 5 years so 3000.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:51:47
Bad idea to rely on someone else to store your coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:24:43
30% now 30% after the fork and 30% the next big dip.
But you will probably buy 0 . Fake.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:07:22
If someone want to give you free money it's a SCAM.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:44:12

@_date: 2017-10-07 00:47:36

Mobile wallet ok if &lt; 400$.
After you should use a paper or hardware wallet to secure your coins.
