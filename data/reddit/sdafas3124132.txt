What's the thinking behind the crackreward? Why does a certain hashrate lead to a predictable cracking reward?

I recommend opening a  smart current account. It will allow you to efficiently (fx conversion happens near spot and transfer fee just £2.49) convert your GBP to EUR and send it to an EUR exchange (of which there are many, unlike for GBP). I would recommend using kraken.com with fidor, but there are other options such as bitstamp.net and zyado.com and many other smaller brokers.. you can of course use them all with your existing bank account too, but you will probably be charged a 3% fx fee, plus a £10-25 transaction fee. Fidor is a useful gateway for getting money out of your current account by faster payments and into a bitcoin exchange by SEPA.

If you open a bitcoin exchange account on  you can withdraw from there to your canadian bank account.  Quadrigacx charges nothing for the bank withdrawal and the trading fees are 0.5% so from a pure fee comparison it should work out slightly cheaper.. however Bitcoin's value can change quite rapidly and you might lose or even gain more than the difference in fees in the time between withdrawing and selling it.
You could also try selling the bitcoin on  in exchange for cash or a cash deposit into your bank account.. that would likely yeild a small profit, but you have to be careful of scammers. 
You could also ask if any of your friends would be interested in buying the bitcoin.
