Can you give me some idea of how much the Pro cost and what percentage you ended up paying in taxes?  Captial gains looks pretty scary.
@_date: 2014-07-01 23:44:41
You know they still have like 114K more right?
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:17:00
Man I love Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-07-03 21:32:16
Everything is always favored by people who have the money to do significant investments.
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:00:25
Can on of us just Patent it and then never touch the patent again?
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:38:10
How is BIP0038 a bad idea?
@_date: 2014-07-19 21:11:30
Not exactly cheaper.  
@_date: 2014-01-03 22:40:55
Why can't we just partition the blockchain every year?
That way we could always look back at past transactions, but once a year a new blockchain Partition would start and only have the current balances of all the addresses.
This would make it so we do not have to keep downloaded years of data, just the current year.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:18:03
Perfect... Also who puts Ebay in with Amazon.
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:43:37
This seems to be true.
@_date: 2014-04-07 17:16:25
You should read [Daemon](  Those are some glasses I could get behind.
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:28:04
I see what you did there.
@_date: 2014-04-02 05:26:32
Well at least bitcoins are safe from the roving monkey bandits.
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:59:25
This won't be far from the truth.
@_date: 2014-05-05 19:27:20
I only read with my ears now.
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:10:28
I just bought more bitcoin after I watched this.
@_date: 2014-07-24 17:21:17
I disagree that it has to sound like NASDAQ or DOW JONES.  To me those sound old and dated.  I mean we are dealing with digital currency that is called 'Bitcoin'.  I'm not saying the name is perfect but this is how stuff is done.  When NASDAQ was started I'm sure people said it sounded stupid.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:17:07
It is not JUST the greater good.  If Bitcoin fails, they will fail as well.  This is mutual destruction.
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:41:54
Geez, i wish i had 386 bitcoins.

I love how you say 'Respect to Buffett' then immediately disrespect him.
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:55:57
Yea, plus reddit is almost one just big repost.  So you should be use to it by now.
@_date: 2014-11-16 07:29:03
I'd donate to see a bitcoin ad in the superbowl.

I cannot wait for OpenBazaar.  I hope it dethrones Ebay.
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:00:26
Thanks for explaining this.

This is why I use AOL.  No one hacks them anymore.

Nothing stupid per se.  I guess if it was me going to have to talk in front of a camera I would be as knowledgeable of the topic as I possibly could.
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:32:39
Man, I want a 3D printer so bad...
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:26:23
Your eloquence and ability to find the perfect words were astonishing in the interview.  A perfect form of geek and politician. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 18:33:03
Ron Paul.  I like you, so if you are going to talk about a subject please learn about it.  So that you can help other people learn correctly about it.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:03:19
To be fair, if I was looking for him and found this dude I would have investigated him as much as possible.  From what apparently the family members said about him, he sounds like a guy who could have created bitcoin.

Time to get competent if you are going to talk about it on TV.
@_date: 2014-08-09 05:02:18
Haha, I thought the same exact thing.  Let me just get my measly amount of Bitcoins before it goes too crazy (already crazy enough).
@_date: 2014-06-22 06:20:29
Has to be profits.

@_date: 2014-06-06 05:11:51
I took the test and also uploaded my resume\info.  I might not be best suited for this exact job, but I know I could be of use to your team.
@_date: 2014-09-20 23:47:18
I like OpenBazaar, but it has to be made much easier for the general public to latch on.  People want just a website they can go to.  Not everyone wants to run a node, or can run a node.
@_date: 2014-09-10 20:08:17
10 Days...

The thing is there are SO many characters.  And it isn't the easiest thing a CPU to do is to try and crack it.

@_date: 2014-04-23 00:34:25
If you end up having to get rid of anything.  I would hope that it might be the camera.  I love the idea of bluetooth and NFC payments.  I really think that scanning a QR code is tedious and doesnt really feel futuristic.  I think wallets need to be nearly as painless as credit cards are now.
All that being said.  If this existed now I would buy it so fast.
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:49:56
That's pretty blurred. I would like to see if they could get it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:34:08
Man, I have a pretty big bro crush on Andreas Antonopoulos.
@_date: 2014-08-01 21:17:46
I'll buy that for a dollar.
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:55:08
I'd plug in some of those 'old machines' at my house if they want me to store them.
@_date: 2014-10-01 22:41:56
Even BTER would give you better rates.
@_date: 2014-09-11 04:15:04
Also the program I was using can do it in chuncks, and if the reward was enough I think a few of us were going to get together and run each chunk on our own.
@_date: 2014-08-11 18:12:41
Good interview.
@_date: 2014-09-11 00:37:22
It still is happening. In 20 years the postal service will be a shell of what it was compared to the early 90's.

Not if you used the built in keyboard in windows.
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:47:31
Everyone has said mining at home is not profitable always thinks in the exact price of electricity to bitcion at todays rate.  I mine and think of each bitcoin worth a Million a piece so it always works out in my favor.
@_date: 2014-06-08 01:48:00
If anything fails bitcoin it will be that we don't have a great way of securing them.  I'm pretty technical and think I did a great job but I don't want to have to pull up a paper wallet for the rest of my life and also hope that someone doesn't hack my phone.
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:24:48
You should just watch it.  At least from the 39m mark.
@_date: 2014-07-21 01:00:51
Send me your BTC and I'll spend them for you.
@_date: 2014-04-23 00:42:30
We have TONS of words with double meanings. But I would contend that the word 'bit' in computer lingo is still hardly really used. Also the world is all about shortening words at the moment and it makes sense.  This is only part of a full bitcoin, just a bit.
@_date: 2014-02-19 07:53:27
You would be wrong on thinking that 'everyone HAS to accept'='legal tender'.
This is certainly not the case.
I thought the same until I watched a few videos where someone tried to pay their debt in pennies. The person holding the debt gets to declare what they get paid in. They could only accept goats.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:29:51
I would watch this movie.
@_date: 2014-02-19 07:56:36
They do not have to accept the $100.
@_date: 2014-01-02 03:39:19
Did they use a phone with a crack in it?
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:52:46
First off, anyone who uses "Sheepole" should get an automatic down vote. Though I can agree with you that regulation can get out of control, but having no regulation also has shown to be a bad thing.  If they can create regulations that allow businesses that pass them become trust worthy, then they did their job. That is what they are supposed to do.
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:22:50
I wouldn't be 100% sure about this statement.  5 years ago no one fathomed bitcoin.  The best things to come from it probably wont happen for another 10 years and who knows what that will be.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:52:47
I, for one, would be extremely glad if they prove it's not him.  I like to think of SN as a Ghost in the machine, or sent back in time as a last ditch effort to right the ship before it crashes.
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:06:27

Yes, I LOVE silver.  Honestly I even have some copper (super cheap) and other metals.  It's really just like a hobby. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 18:00:04
Easy to understand and a little history lesson.
@_date: 2014-08-01 18:45:09
Honestly, I don't have time to read all that.  Almost any interview i'm going to pay attention to needs to be at least audio.
@_date: 2014-04-23 00:36:44
Just having on board memory (with on board backup) can save space as well. Smaller is always better.

@_date: 2014-01-15 04:50:01
3% is a big number for them.

Audio books are literally the best medium for entertainment. 
@_date: 2014-08-29 16:58:23
That's what gets me.  They haven't or cant re-animate anyone yet.  I guess if you already going to die then the risk is minimal.  All that being said, if I was rich with a terminal disease, I'd try it out.

"If you play by the rules you'll always lose. Because the rules were written by somebody else to maintain the status quo and part of that status quo is that they maintain their position. As long as you follow the rules you'll always be at best number 2"
That was powerful to me.

Geez, that many and I still haven't seen him.  I feel sad now.
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:25:21
Looks great.  My problem is that I LOVE audio books and it's hard for me to go back.  If you could just whisper this into my ear as I fell asleep I'd buy it so hard.
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:54:30
I'll be the judge of that.  Send over the Bitcoins i need to investigate. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 23:16:49
Got to catch them all.
@_date: 2015-08-06 00:20:38
What if your simulator actually got one.  Would it post it?
@_date: 2015-08-06 07:03:00
So no?
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:33:32
I think is a bad pun.

The first thing talked about in the movie is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:54:03
I think it's the fact that she brought it up that surprised me the most.  I basically told myself not to start conversations about bitcoin now and only talk about it when asked.  People ask and then I can shut up.
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:34:39
I recommend your wallet to every new person I talk to bitcoin about.  
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:43:14
Me and my wife were just talking about Coinbase last night, and her facebook feed is now all 'Coinbase, not just for nerds' ads.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:37:00
Rubbed off on my wife after 6 years of talking Bitcoin.  She has a partner and she told her partner that every sale they make in bitcoin stays in bitcoin.  
Her idea is to sell these party boxes as like a grand Birthday\celebration kit.  Instead of just sending a card to someone they get a personalized package.  Check it out and let me know what you think.

Honestly one of the coolest things I've seen in a while.
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:08:29
That's what the article is for.
@_date: 2015-03-10 04:26:13
So I work with litigation eDiscovery and I've found that most data is recoverable it just depends on how much you want to pay.  We do use data recovery specialists and sometimes even send them to places like the FBI.  
  
Now all that being said I have seen drives that were considered 'dead' because the wouldn't work on any computer, but to forensically collect most data we connect it to a few devices (write blocker, bit copier). This seems to do the trick most of the time by just using a hardware bit for bit copier.  You can find one that works for you for around $50. The good ones are $300+.  
  
Good luck man.
@_date: 2016-05-23 17:12:53

I remember a post about Josh Garza from a year ago about him scamming people.
