If you want to buy $1,000 worth of BTC, note the amount of bitcoin that that would earn you (say 0.1 BTC). Buy a desktop with 2 2080 super gpu (say a $2,000 machine).  Mine on nicehash to your bitcoin wallet.  When you get to 0.1 BTC after electric costs, sell your desktop for $1000.

The last Friday of the month is coming.  Everyone thinks that the price will go down (contract expiration), so they sell a day or two earlier and earlier from that date each month.  
But another trend they are not taking into account is that people liquidate in whatever direction sentiment is not headed.
Prediction: they liquidate shorts this month for a change.  By Cyber Monday next week, we touch $9,000.

Last Friday of the month in 2 days.  Longs usually get rekt on that Friday because of leveraged trading.  It’s only rational for longs to sell before that Friday, so they aren’t the ones getting rekt.  I sold everything a couple of days ago.

That makes sense.  But as the number of shut off miners increases, so does the risk that someone would turn them all on at the same time and do a double spend attack, right?  I mean, free money for them, right?  I would argue that that price is the real floor of Bitcoin, the floor beyond which no Bitcoin holder would dare allow the price to drop below.

So, you believe that these companies were in effect unable to manipulate the price of altcoins/bitcoin because of their listing status.  If they were unlisted, then they would (probably) have done what I wrote in September, because it was in their own best interest.  Interesting.

I was trying to use bitcoin to build intercollegiate bonds, more so than dog sitting would for example.  When giving young people a chance to start a business, one often gets low hanging fruit like dog sitting, babysitting, car washing, uber, etc. I was trying to get something more like opening a convenience store, running a food court, starting a theater group, building, running, and maintaining bitcoin ATMs, etc.  Things people could put on a professional resume.  But other stuff is good too.

I think that from a legal perspective, people do own bitcoins. 
From: [
"Ownership is the legal right to the possession of a thing. The object of ownership can be tangible such as personal property and land or it can be intangible such as intellectual property rights over musical, literary or scientific creations of the mind. Ownership also includes rights allowing a person to use and enjoy certain property (physical or intellectual). It includes the right to convey it to others. It can also be the state or fact of being an owner."
Applying that concept to bitcoin, no one can possess it and it is not tangible, so that part of the definition does not apply. Intellectual property rights also don't seem to apply, because it was not created by the mind in a creative process or invented. However ownership includes the right to convey it to others, which does seem to apply. So I would say that since none of the usual definitions apply, that one remaining definition, the right to convey it to others, implies that one does own bitcoin.  Otherwise, for example, how can nicehash complain last year when someone stole their bitcoin?  The police (supposedly) investigated it because someone (supposedly) conveyed their bitcoin to others, without the right to do so.

I guess I thought that making the whole series of businesses run on bitcoin would, if nothing else, be a nice marketing gimmick. "\[College name\] Bitcoin Incubator Hub" on billboards through the city.  Bitcoins decorating a sign "\[College name\] of the future!"  I was also hoping that it would avoid certain kinds of businesses, like dog sitting businesses, and would force the students to make businesses for the other students.  Maybe it's a stupid gimmick, I don't know, I figured asking here might help me make that determination, too.

Imagine we got to a situation where the price was so low that there were only 100 mining farms left, producing a total of 1 Million TH.  Since we said for the sake of argument that the total available machines to hash would make 100 million TH. Let's again for simplicity say that these machines, shut off because the price was too low to sustain them, are in 50 equally sized factories, and therefore each factory could mine almost 2 million Th each. Why wouldn't one of those factories turn everything on for just enough time to double spend, and shut them off again, laughing all of the way to the bank?
Edit: because I can't type good.

This sounds cool, but what is the real use case?  Plugging my old Directv satellite dish at it, installing some kind of driver for it, and having it function as an internet proxy with only one host, a server with the blockchain?  If it's unilateral only, how do I tell it what part of the blockchain I need, or get it to repeat any data my directv missed as an airplane flew between me and the satellite?    What problem does this solve, that a vpn doesn't solve better?  Mining in the national forests with solar panels and a satellite dish, with 3G phones for data uplinks when I find a block in my warehouse of S9 miners installed in my 4wd winnebago? Or is it so I can pay Bubba for the firewood he is chopping for me, and he can verify the transaction without leaving the forest? I call BS on this whole idea.

" Of all the benevolent dictators in history, none deserve the title more than Mr Lee. For 31 years, he ruled as prime minister of Singapore, and for two more decades, he held a key position in the cabinet. Firmly entrenched, and with a free hand, Lee moulded [Singapore]( in his own image and made it what it is today – a prosperous city-state with an intensely pragmatic people under the spell of a peculiar brand of “soft” authoritarianism."

I don't think that she has a firm plan of what she means, and was looking for different creative ideas that might fit in that general category.  For example, perhaps this program would be available to people, but they would be required to be enrolled part time and progressing towards getting a bachelors in business from the school. Perhaps classes would be held at non-traditional times of the day, or primarily online, to provide the students time to work at their new businesses and eventually get a degree.  I only included enough info to get thoughts on the bitcoin part of the overall proposal.

Yup.  Or equivalent “investments.”  Perhaps Nvidia would even buy a bunch of bitcoin and then use it to buy some altcoins that only their gpus mine, or maybe buy processing power for those bitcoins on nicehash.  Something like that.
@_date: 2018-07-06 11:56:58
I guess the question in my mind is: why wouldn’t these groups do this?  It is in their company’s own best interest, and it’s not illegal or necessarily a bad long term financial decision to buy bitcoin either.  Why would they work against their own interests and not do this?
@_date: 2018-07-08 11:52:08
I have some not insignificant experience in this area. That is exactly how things work. Sure, they'll cloak it in a press release "Nvidia invests $100 million dollars in new blockchain startup!" The $100 million goes off of their primary ledger, and then the new wholly owned startup loses $50 Million. Next quarter they make $500 Million selling video cards, and buried in some addendum somewhere are $50 million in losses, attributed to startup costs for their new blockchain company.

I’m not suggesting that they need to buy every bitcoin, just enough to cause others to reverse their positions, fomo, and buy in.  Same stuff we see all of the time.
@_date: 2018-07-06 11:59:09
It’s an approximation, based upon the market volume.  If it takes $150 million, same argument.

Even if it is, why would Nvidia not do this for 3 months to sell it's new GPU's.
Even if it is, why would Coinbase etc not do this for 3 months to sell their new ETFs.

Thank you for explaining why you think I'm wrong. That was what I asked for, as opposed to others on this thread who were like "bagholder permabull bias!"
I realize you basically called me that, too, but at least there was a thoughtful response along with it.
By the way, I'm not a bagholder, nor a permabull, which was why I only talked about the next few months. I have no idea what will happen after that. I agree that capitulation did not truly occur.
Just like tether stepped in to artificially inflate the price, my argument was that it is in nvidia/(Amd)/(Intel)/ETFs power and best interest to inflate over the next few months.  Nvidia may have been warning about the mining gig for quite some time, but they were recently inducted into the Nasdaq 100. Mining has a lot to do with that. Maybe Bitcoin is a confidence game, but over the next few months its in the powers-that-be's interest to make the price go up.
People will disagree with that assertion: "RAWR, Nvidia has driverless car computing solutions, AI solutions, Gaming cards! I pity da foo who thinks it's all about mining!" etc etc.  I agree that they have some great projects down the road, and of course they are successful, but that the near term success which has propelled them to Nasdaq 100 is mining.
Again, with ETFs, the best way to get artificially high returns would be to crush the market, start ones ETF, and then inflate it. I think that that has been what is happening. I am arguing that over the next few months, that the inflation cycle occurring is in new ETF's control, and best interest, so it must happen. After their bitcoin fund makes 180&amp; returns in the first 6 months!", they can put it on an ad, and promote their ETF on Foxnews.
People do what is in their best interest, if they are able.
Do you agree that this is in the aforementioned companies power to do?
Do you agree that this is in the aforementioned companies best interest to do?
If so, why would they not do it?

I thought that the expression “move the earth” meant “move the dirt,” not “move the world.”
If so, the real question is whether 6x10^11 is enough to start an earthquake.  Given that the Seahawks fans shake their stadium enough to show up on seismographs, I am certain that the entire worlds population jumping up and down on a single tectonic plate in Asia would cause an earthquake, and depending where they jumped, possibly a tsunami or a volcanic eruption.
Tectonic plates are floating on a molten sea.  We are all standing on the rough equivalent of a cherry pie’s top crust.  If enough people jump on one spot, it’s like a knife cutting through the crust.  Ergo moving the earth.

There would have to be some kind of peg establishing the value of the US dollar in terms of gold, or perhaps a range the dollar would be allowed to trade within.  In other words, an ounce of gold might be set at 800 to 1000 usd.  Then that peg would be attacked and the us would have to defend the peg, perhaps by purchasing gold or dollars, as the case may be.  If they could maintain the peg, then nothing would happen.  If they weren’t, they’d have to go off of the gold standard.  They would be constantly worried about the peg when doing budget modifications, because each issuance of money would require a corollary effort to maintain the peg.  So eventually the usd would go off of the gold standard.
If one was to do this, I’d recommend a basket of commodities standard.  So when gold ran out, you could increase the exchange rate to wheat, oil, coal, etc.  it would provide more flexibility.  But the real question is why the us would do this in the first place.  Seems like the government gets a better deal now.

Except for people who went short, as well as (generally older) people who are invested in fixed investments. When asset prices crash, they can finally buy the boat they always wanted, the house they always wanted, or the bitcoin they always wanted. They win.
