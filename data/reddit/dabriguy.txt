You are telling me someone would like about that? On the internet?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:18:21
Genuine questioc, what would these be?

You and another dude just reported the same thing. He had a $990 transaction. Damn. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:21:13
You're a good dude, dude.

I’m not implying that Bitcoin itself could be used for voting but could the Blockchain technology backing it, that makes it so secure, be used to make a secured voting system?

Thank you for the informative response! Exactly what I was looking for. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:47:27
Oh, do not be mistaken, there is enough room for both.

As a relative noob, I’m proud to say that the spikes don’t really phase me. My parents always told me to treat invested money like it’s gone. Reduces the stress involved plus it helps that I really do believe in Bitcoin.

I'm 18 now and putting half my paycheck into it. Call me naive but we are witnessing something that will change the world forever.

It's a genuine question. No one is talking about the actual politics here. It's a matter of it being a rather large world event. The EURO is already losing value. I could see how some people may invest in an alternate currency.

"only"

Ah I see 
I'm jelaous of you man. I'm 18 and I wish I had a higher income to put more in. Putting in around $80 a week.

Not the Intention of this post. I'm still relatively new to Bitcoin and any sort of investment/stock. It's more an educational question as it seems the EURO is losing value and I was wondering if crypto currency sees a less significant effect.

Thank you!!! I really believe in Bitcoin.
I have gotten 3 of my family members invested already. One brother has $100 so far, the other has a couple hundred and is putting in $50 a week automatically and just last night I got my mom to buy $100 worth! My grandparents are next.

$6000 on the dot
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:33:57
Touché

Hypothetically let's say it turns violent, What would that do to the cost?
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:07:07
As a young adapter....this makes me smile. Thanks!
