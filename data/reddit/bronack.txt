Scurrying away to $1999.60? Relax lol

And the wait is over. $2000 on bitstamp now

Okay I'll switch from SMS to Google Authenticator if I ever get back into my account. I haven't changed my carrier since it stopped working so that isn't the issue. Regardless, thanks for the info.

I was under the impression that a chain split was highly likely, not unlikely

Isn't it $4100 USD per bitcoin in Korea...?

Yeah I've never understood the animosity against blockchain.info. I controlled the private keys the second I made my wallet on there. And how is it an exchange if you can't buy or sell bitcoins on it? Always confuses me

Good, keep hodling!
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:00:29
Okay thank you for the help. I appreciate it!
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:42:26
Did that back in 2013 when I made the wallet. So I should be set

Make another paper wallet? As a backup to my current one, or because the key has changed?
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:13:13
From what I've read in this sub, yeah. I was about to order one
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:55:16
Alright awesome, I guess I'm more prepared than I originally thought. So the keys change? Because I haven't moved my coins since I created the wallet back in 2013. They've been on the same address the whole time
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:48:18
The private keys? Like the QR code? Cool, I did that back in 2013 when I opened my wallet on blockchain.info. Just making sure though, thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:43:09
I made a paper wallet through blockchain.info a few years ago that has the private key and address on it. Wouldn't that count as a paper wallet? I'm genuinely curious, not being a dick
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:01:25
Okay maybe I'll make a new paper wallet so I have one to back up the old one I made in 2013
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:44:44
It's on a single address since I started. Thanks for the info though, I didn't know that
