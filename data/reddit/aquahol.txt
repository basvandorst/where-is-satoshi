There's two kinds of news: information someone doesn't want you to know, and information someone wants you to know.
Most Bitcoin "news" sites only publish the latter and are essentially venues for companies to publish press releases. I applaud coinfire for doing proper investigative journalism.

That's absurd, the Blockstream employment is public and your mining remark is pure speculation.
Smaller blocks means miners earn more money (lower costs, fewer orphaned blocks, &amp; potentially higher fees).
The reason most miners support larger blocks is because they like Bitcoin and want it to grow.

Miners earn the same amount as a block reward regardless of how big blocks are. Transaction fees are negligible compared with the revenue from block reward.

There's no good ways to get bitcoins "for free", because no one gives away free money.

How does having one dev team that has absolute control over the technical direction of bitcoin lend itself to decentralization? It's the very definition of a centralized system (of development). 
Different dev teams are not competitors. They are working in parallel to find different solutions to the same problems. This whole mindset of alternate dev efforts being "hostile", "coup attempts", and "attacks" is absurd. What exactly are they competing for? Money? Market share? These are exactly the kinds of perverse incentives that bitcoin seeks to get rid of.
@_date: 2016-02-07 00:38:37
But we need to know what your grandma that you gave that paper wallet to thinks about the technical feasibility of a hard fork and it's effects on a decentralized peer to peer network before we can have consensus!
@_date: 2016-02-10 06:26:05
Miners support bigger blocks not because they want free things but because if all but a few expensive settlement transactions are pushed "off chain", it destroys their long term business model of collecting mining fees, even if individual fees are higher in a small block scenario.
How do 2MB blocks promote centralization to such a degree that it harms the network?
Isn't the fact that a small group of developers are exerting so much control right now also a threat of centralization?
@_date: 2016-02-11 04:28:54
I didn't mean everyone should have commit access, I was making the same point as in your second paragraph. Unfortunately alternate developer efforts are being treated as hostile attacks and not merely something that should be happening in an open source software community.

Dude, this is the kind of language that is causing all the divisiveness. Why do you put "developers" in quotations? So you can downplay their contributions and pretend that all the talent is at core? This is what people mean by saying you guys are stuck in an ivory tower.
Pull the stick out of your ass.
Warren Togami, everyone. Another one of the Blockstream/Core devs, in case you were curious who it is that keeps flinging poo in these discussions.
edit: Also, your use of the term "minority of" is an attempt at an appeal to majority. Just because Core has more people on their repo does not automatically make their ideas better.
And I wasn't talking about developer consensus, I was referring to how divisive you guys are being and driving a wedge through the community. Core's vision and current tactics certainly do not have community consensus, as much as you all like to pretend that having full consensus is all-important.

Re: the gems advertising model. I understand receiving ads is optional. However, most people who don't care about being given fractions of a penny to look at shit ads will disable this feature. The only people left will be the ones who can be bothered to earn fractions of a cent for wasting their time - users like this are near-worthless to advertisers as they don't have much money to spend on things to begin with.
Gems, having no other purpose than to buy these cheap, low-value ads, become nothing more than a shitcoin, the cost of buying ads bottoms out, and the whole system doesn't work.
The idea of putting a Bitcoin wallet inside a chat app is a great one, it's too bad the developers decided to go the shitcoin route with this.

What difference does it make who Satoshi is? I think his identity being known would actively hinder bitcoin's adoption. Satoshi was a genius for many reasons, a big one being that he knew if he didn't release anonymously he'd both be a target for thieves or governments, and another being that the media would try to make bitcoin about him personally.
Also, Satoshi being anonymous to this day just makes for a great story and I think only adds to bitcoin's mystique.

If the users pay fees on their transactions, I see no problem with that. Who are you to decide which transactions are worthy or not?
Having lightning available as an option is fine, but having it as the only alternative to transacting on the blockchain is forcing users into that system and creating a hierarchy where some transactions are "worthy" of the blockchain and the security it provides, and those who can't afford it have to lock up coins on Lightning channels (which assumes they have extra money laying around to lock up), and they *still* need to pay blockchain tx fees every time they open and close a channel.
If blocks are already full and all LN users need to make transactions on the blockchain, how does that work with 1MB blocks that are full already?
Also, LN is *at least* a year from even existing. Right now it is a theoretical prototype. Bitcoin is at max load now, how much longer can we keep waiting?

The idea behind having two people hold the keys is that in case one dies or disappears, the other may still access it, OR to prevent one person alone from having full access.
It sounds like your strategy has neither the redundancy nor the additional security. If it takes both people's cooperation to access funds, but you are not using multisignature keys, then if one person dies funds are still lost.
However if each person has full access to funds, then you are just adding an additional point of failure and not actually increasing security.
Am I misunderstanding anything?
