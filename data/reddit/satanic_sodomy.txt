I would listen to OP if you are considering throwing money at BFL. BitCoin is a land full of "too good to be true".  Does getting 4x the hashing speed at 1/4th the cost seem too good to be true? &lt;Christian Bale&gt;THINK! FOR ONE FUCKING SECOND!&lt;/Christian Bale&gt;

BUY BUY BUY!!!!! Price expected to hit $20 soon then pop. Satan tells me so. So does Mitt Romney. But I repeat myself.

yeah i'm trying to sell when it jumps a dollar or two and rebuy when it drops again. I want to increase the BTC that I have through trades like this. I don't know if it will work, but anyone who sold when it was $15 could've rebought at about half that price a few days later. Made some BTC. On top of that, what they bought then went up to $12. Could've sold and rebuy if it hits $10. Made some BTC. The key is to alway rebuy, though. Keep assets in BTC long term but short term cash out when you think the price is inflated and rebuy after it falls to normal. Keep in mind I am doing this with very small amount of money ($20).  I really should invest larger amounts for long term. But maybe I can turn my ~2 BTC into 4 or 10. That's all I'm after at the moment.

I'm telling you. GET A REFUND NOW if you can. Your ASIC will probably never arrive but they will surely keep stringing you along with bullshit, send a few units to prominent members of Bitcointalk.org so that you can be shouted down if you question when your order will arrive.  I've seen these scams before, you will most likely receive jack fucking shit from them, ever.  You don't have to listen to me, but for fuck's sake, get a refund. Even if they ship every order out before the block reward halving your share of the pie will be so small it'll take forever to turn a profit. After the halving.... good luck.  I'll be here in January saying "I Told You So" after the company goes under or delays shipping by 6 months.  GET A REFUND, NOW!  &lt;/spreading fud&gt;

sooo, what price to sell at? 12, 13, 14, 15? 
@_date: 2012-10-06 03:15:04
Nope. $268.78.

Would be nice but any items I have that are worth anything are usually overstock and can't be sold.

This motherfucker has it nailed. This is exactly what's going on. Get your money out now cause the sooner people start catching on, the sooner BFL runs off with your BTC.
