It was either access my wallet from another wallet provider OR use another responsive server. I will check this out. Thanks!

I've already seen this post, I was unable to add these servers. 
**Could you give instructions on how to do it?**

Thanks, but setting up my own bitcoin core full node is not an option. Will export import, but how to import to Mycelium?
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:04:19
I am not sure if this would work.. I've already tried recovering to Mycelium with Electrum generated  seed to no avail.
Yeah I meant accessing that wallet, not move bitcoins, thanks for pointing that out.

Haha thanks for advice! Are you talking about Roger Ver?

Does this mean that I can recover my wallet to another Electrum wallet, generate a new seed, this time specify BIP39, and after that, recover this newly created wallet (already BIP39 seed) from another wallet like Mycelium? Is that what you're saying?

You can use this guide. This guide is for advanced users only, but have a look around the site, I am sure you will find it useful.

people on Reddit don't use emojis when joking, so that's the result for you!
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:09:48
Tiny or not, I earned it! You're just jealous because you prefer to watch TV and do nothing! You want to get bitcoin without doing any work. You just hope that someone will give it to you for free. You're just a freeloader. You're hating on people who earn money in their free time, because you can't do it yourself. You are just too lazy and want everything to be done for you, you want everything for free. I bet you're still living with your mom and can't cook. Your mom is still serving your dinner every night?
I on the other hand worked hard to get referrals and will continue to do so for many more years to come and fully deserve it!
That's the difference between you and I!

No not Trevon sorry.

Before I signed up I did hear there were a lot of half-bakeds, loonies on Reddit.

Thanks! Corrected ��

No, I am not planning to sell it. 
What I meant was should I hodl it or should I invest it?
By investing, I meant should I use this money to start a website or should I hodl?

Actually I know of many payment providers that offer vcc's but after having done some research online, I found that many such services are unreliable or just scam. I actually found many negative reviews about some of the vcc providers which I will mention below, and according to user reviews I found online, some of them even committed fraud with their users' account. So I would be careful with such services.
There are many providers online, and I have chosen 4 of them and did a thorogh research. They are EntroPay, Money Polo, Neteller and Yandex Money. After doing a couple of days research I have stopped at Yandex Money because it is a trusted company and their virtual card is actually provided by a trusted bank. I found many negative reviews and user experience about all of them except for Yandex Money. Just do google their name + review and read all the reviews to see what I mean.
Yandex Money is a search engine giant, the Russian version of Google, so there are less trust issues with them. It's a reputable company and for me this was the best option.
The only downside is that it only has a Russian ruble wallet, no other currencies. If you deposit USD or any other currency in your Yandex Money wallet, the funds automatically get converted into rubles according to their rates at the time the money is received, the same applies if you spend your rubles to buy anything online in USD or other currencies.
I have also started this same thread on BitcoinTalk if you are interested:
I hope you found this information useful, actually I might do another post later and review some bitcoin debit card providers.
Thank you for reading!
