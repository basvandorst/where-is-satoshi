Seems legit.

Sounds like base64 to me, possible encrypted? I think the old android bitcoin wallet stored keys like this, although I'm not certain of the file name. If so, it's aes-256-cbc, so you can use something like openssl to decrypt it:
    openssl aes-256-cbc -base64 -d

That looks a lot more promising. I'm 99% sure that means you have the wrong password. You could alternatevlely try to import it back into the android app as that looks like where it's from, but I doubt that will help if the password is wrong.

Try that last command again with -base64 as an argument as well
pi openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -base64 -in bitcoin-wallet-keys-2013-12-30 -out file.txt

Good to know, thanks. I found it by literally trying "

I'm supposed to just trust a USB device that's handed to be by a stranger? How can one verify that it's a genuine opendime and not a replica device that is made to look like one, or one with altered firmware? This way it could drop a malicious payload upon connection, or just refuse to reveal the keys. I would not trust one of these at all.

You'd be surprised! Leaving USB memory sticks lying around near a target is a popular technique among pentesters. I hear that most have a great success rate doing this. It *should* be common sense, though.

I believe it was something to this effect, yes.
