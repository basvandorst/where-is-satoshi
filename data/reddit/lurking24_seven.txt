The idea is to get rid of your fiat problems through btc, then re-invest with the extra fiat funds month by month over time, so when fiat dies, you will have enough btc to be well off.

While I hope that will be true, a good point to remember is that there is a price you can put on being debt free. It might be worth it to OP to be mentally unburdened rather than (potentially) being richer. It's something he has to consider. Is OP good with having debt, and staking it all on BTC, or is OP good with getting rid of debt, then using the extra fiat per month to re-invest? If OP is young enough, simply re-investing (even at ATH's) would be a sound move.
