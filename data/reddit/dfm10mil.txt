2800 max. Lower than 2k would be a disaster. Been in for 2 years..

“I’m from Zimbabwe. I have bought 2000 worth of bitcoin. That’s half of my family savings. Bought at 9000.” - that’s your post.. remember?? 
What should I do guys?? Hold or sell?” 
You’re just a dumb idiot who didn’t manage his portfolio right so you’re just mad and spreading fud.

I care about the senseless FUD. It creates psychological barriers for price uptrends... I don’t want to wait years because some morons were talking shit for no reason... so I’m trying to get a sense what motivates them

I think you’re confused a bit. If it reaches 2k or below it would break all major support levels and then a major panic mode would kick in. It would take yeaaars to recover.. as it would leave the psychological trust all messed up. I’m picking up some more around 3k but I wouldn’t want it to fall below 2700.. TA doesn’t lie. Take it as you will but I called the drop to 4K back in June against every call out there :)
