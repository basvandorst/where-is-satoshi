You do realize the average person who bought into bitcoin is going to lose money, right? Maybe not today, or tomorrow, or even a year, but in aggregate, the average person will lose. Why, because as of today, **$1,018,898,663 (and counting) has been sunk into miner fees - that's money that has been burned into electricity** and can never be recovered by the network. If, for some reason, everyone want to leave the market and sell out. Everyone who bought in, as a whole, would get their money back minus the **$1 BILLION** used to 'protect' the network.
This makes BTC a negative sum game in the long run.  If you think it will recover, go ahead and wait and hold. Best of luck - because remember for that to happen, it will come at the expense of someone else buying in to push up the price. 
My suggestion - swallow your pride and let what happen be what it is. If you absolutely need to stay in the game, at the very least, scale out of your position and reduce your BTC holdings to something small.
Good luck.

I see where you are coming from, and for small companies this is true, but the profit margin wouldn't be that big for Amazon. Bigger companies like Amazon, Best Buy, Kohls, Macy's etc. have store credit cards which lower the fees to about 1% (this is why they push them so aggressively). To add to that, the [Amazon's credit card]( provides 3% back to it user. This is pretty much the same reward that Gyft has.
Both the companies and the consumers already have a low(er) fee and rewards system. Essentially, the current Bitcoin infrastructure is only providing similar fees (~1%) and rewards (~3%) that credit cards already offer. For small companies that don't have favorable deals with the giant banks, it's great because they can increase their profit margin quite a bit, but BTC has to do even better than this before it can convince huge companies that it is a better alternative to credit cards.

is correct, this fund is crap compared to most funds out there. There are great index funds that have no front end, no back end, and management fees below 1% (Actually, a good fund will probably have an expense ratio/management fees around 0.50% or lower). This fund has about x10 the fees you could find elsewhere. Consider this if you're thinking of buying in.


Let's look at [GLD, the SPDR Gold ETF] ( they mention in their fact sheet:
* The front end fees are 0%
* The back end fees are 0%
* The expense ratio (management fees) are 0.40%
* Going through a brokerage like ScottTrade, you'd probably have to dish out $7, but they (ScottTrade) probably has a comparable fund that will waive this fee.

You're describing the practices of banks and credit unions, not exchanges.

'Knowing better than the public' and 'thinking you know better than the public,' are two very different things. One will make you money in the long run, the latter will eat away at your hard earned money. 
Someone owned bitcoin and sold them to you for fiat - one of you was on the right side of the trade. Are you certain your opinion was better than his?

Fair enough, but my point is, if you compare this fund to other existing funds, their fees rank among the [worst available] ( The difference between ~4% and 0.40% are huge, and while a BTC fund will probably run on the high side for security purposes, from an investment standpoint, it's simply not that attractive.
To put it into context, even buying through Coinbase (~1% front, ~1% back, no management fees) is a better alternative than this. And well, you can actually use the Bitcoin you buy.
