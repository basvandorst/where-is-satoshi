good to hear, I'm switching from a local to online this year and the btc books are the only ones not giving a shit who you are or where you live

i dont see one part of your post that is both accurate and relevant.  take as much time as you need to edit.
@_date: 2016-02-12 03:17:03
ill reply since im bored as shit.
1 your article confirms there is internet access, its very dated info by the way (not really fun fact, Cuba's first btc transaction occurred last year)
2 why do you think i am planning to bring or obtain btc in Cuba?  atm is needed to change btc to pesos you halftard

i have been using coinbase wallet to send/receive bitcoin with nitrogen sports over the past year with no problems.  my last transaction was december 18 from nitrogen directly to the coinbase wallet and i just logged into it just fine.  coinbase exchange account is still good as well.

its really too bad that you failed to turn off the shutoff on the horizontal end of the dicepter rod. this can result in severe deficits in cycle volativity within multiple crevices. try to be smart.

relevant story.  i was lost and drunk in middle of the night, lost my friends, and rain was pouring down. a black girl stops her car and gave me a ride.  as soon as I'm in her car she unzips my pants and starts giving me head.  she drove me home and I bought her gas. i think in my drunken stupor I left my debit card in her car and maybe she saw my pin when I paid at pump for gas.  anyway I noticed $500 ATM charge next day, filed dispute, and visa credited me back.  pretty simple for me.
