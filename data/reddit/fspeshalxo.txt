Well the only thing fb is doing that he is selling your privacy means your data for marketing purposes selling advertising.. i dont see any problem with that honestly 
But they said that it’s going to be separate from Facebook data 
The only problem is that i don’t think its 100% decentralized..and that will just make it a paypal alternative.. 
So no other money could really compete with bitcoin , if only was stable i don’t care about the profits..i want to use bitcoin as a daily money wich is impossible..

Yes i told him to use payeer instead

Thats the shit about crypto currency ..at first was suppose to be a money ..now its just for trading and making profits and shit..
@_date: 2019-07-26 15:38:07
Even better 
Use Payeer 
No verification and you get to buy at a good price
You can also deposit usd from a bank or so

All those currencies are waiting “to go moon” and get rich.. so it’s not a money its more like “gold” hold it and price increase but more risky 
Everybody is insulting libra but in my opinion if its going to be stable and for everyone in the world , that would be great..
