I get what you are saying, but once these all things all happen, what is the difference with fiat? The exchanges just function the same as a "bank" then.

I think it will drop a little bit further. But not that fast... Just slow and steady.

Korea might not seem to ban crypto completly. But I'm kinda afraid they will put in more regulations instead.

Well. I made my profits, I am out! Thanks everyone :D

Pyramid scheme

Fees are actually really high.

Ppl are starting to lose faith in HODL-ing...
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:20:21
That's probably also why everyone stops selling...

next hour going to be crucial. If the trend is broken we might go up a hell lot. But if the trend doesn't brake, I don't see where it would end...

lol. How many times are you going to post this?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:09:28
Prices are going back to normal.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:56:17
Bitcoin isn't going to the moon. Fees are tough...
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:06:32
cheap? 16K a coin? lol.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:46:38
Doesn't look like it. It's only going down over here...
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:06:24
Liftoff... I am selling, Feel fewer and fewer ppl are willing to buy the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:38:57
Damn high transactionfees. I think I will sell out right now, the fees might even go up with this volatility.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:44:11
He says so because it seems to be the fact so far...
But nobody can forsee the future.

I'll guess we will go down deeper and deeper down in a slower and slower speed. Seems people are losing faith in this coin. The problem is not that it doesn't go up anymore, the problem is that money from people buying at the dips are drying up. Making the total loses more then the average gains.

Kim Jong-un ain't going to be happy when he wakes up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:38:23
Yep, the chaine is broken, it's loose... Drop incoming.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:06
One of the other coins will probably reach it before bitcoin does. That's what I was trying to say.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:48
Maybe altcoins will be at this by that time. not bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:08:14
If we go down any further from now on it has broken the lowest point in a week time. Then the way down to an even lower level is likely I think.
