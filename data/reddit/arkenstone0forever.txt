I didn't have any problems with them till my last sell and I'm still waiting for them to answer my ticket. Anways after my sell order was cancelled  they send my coins to unknown address and they  holding them there for over 4 days now. Maybe they mistakenly send them to wrong address I don't know.   I'm starting to freak out a bit.

*"In July we have to offer very concrete, very specific recommendations on, not 'what do we regulate?' but 'what is the data we need?'"*  
They were talking about it for two days - nothing.. and they will talk about it again in July .. that's what I got from this article. So basically they don't know what the hell to do or how to approach this.
