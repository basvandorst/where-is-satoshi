Not sure what bitfinex's plan is but if it's to repay say 70% to users that were compromised, then users with USD balance and BTC that weren't compromised  shouldn't suffer a loss since their assets weren't directly stolen by the hacker.

You state that deposits made after the hack aren't subject to the 36% loss is this true for those that made deposits 2 hours before the site went down as well? In my case the BTC didn't even show up on the site after 15+ confirmations and then shortly after Bitfinex broke the news. My BTC are still showing up on my bitfinex address and were never moved or credited to reflect my balance on the site.

Can you explain this?
"At this time withdrawals are temporarily disabled for your account while we finalize your accounting and balances.
The reason for this delay is due to complications with your USD balances associated with our US banking partners. We are working in conjunction with these partners to restore full service to your account as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience."

I'd like to state that I deposited BTC few hours before the site went down, but the BTC weren't moved; looking at most of your comments suggests my BTC weren't compromised/stolen. So for myself, and other users included in this particular circumstance, didn't even have BTC on the site itself at the time of the actual hack (before the site went down). In this case we shouldn't suffer any sort of loss, thoughts?

It's not all Americans that are in this boat, only the US Verified customers that were with SynpasePay. I've waited weeks and have even contacted support 7+ times to no avail.
