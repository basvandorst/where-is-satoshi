Chrome extensions are actually open source. The problem is updates to extensions are deployed behind the scenes without user intervention. The author of said extension was paid off to infect it's users or it was designed to deliver this terrible payload in a future update.

Unfortunately it's gone like cash. Setup 2 factor authentication on both your BTC-E account and your email service.

If bitcoin is going to gain greater social credibility, value and acceptance, better idiot-proofing and anti-scam measures will only help the speed up adoption. Blaming the victim doesn't restore lost coins. This should be easy and safe enough for your Grandma to use, like email.

Sure, good advice for the tech savvy. The glaring problem with chrome extension is that they automatically update behind the scenes. Previous versions may be working as advertised however after the extension builds up a sizable user base, the author can push out the malicious version. There's even instances of extensions being re-sold and re-purposed for nefarious reasons.
tl;dr extensions cannot be trusted even if you review the code. Use a dedicated system for your crypto or follow this advice with incognito mode.
