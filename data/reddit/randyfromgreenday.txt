except the value of the dollar hasn't and doesnt change as much and as fast as bitcoin. that $12.35 would now be $13.08 if paid with dollars instead of $275 in bitcoins, huge difference. using bitcoin for purchasing sandwiches is currently just not worth it. until it is more stable, and has lower fees, comparing it to everyday currency is pointless.

What makes it a scam?

No, you hold dollars because you need to purchase goods and services with a commonly accepted currency that is stable. You hold bitcoin likely as an investment. I dont know what point youre trying to make, but if you think using bitcoin to purchase a sandwich is a good idea, have at it

I tried playing the market for a little bit, and realized that I'm an idiot and lost money... and would have made money just doing nothing. luckily its not a lot, but every penny counts. my moon is when i can afford a new roof on my house

Bank of America does in fact suck, however, and I hate that I am in anyway defending them, they do not stop you from or charge you extra for using coinbase/purchasing bitcoin. I have them and use them all the time to buy on coinbase.

I use Bank of America and have no problem purchasing from coinbase and get no additional fees from my bank.
