It's not the FUD/ China ban/ Korea ban, the market was already not looking pretty before the whole Korea ban happened.

And yet they quote the man non stop. That’s the annoying part. If you don’t like him because of how he views crypto, then stop using his quotes to shill your garbage.

I just hope that the bear market isn’t a multi year one. I should say I am comfortable with a multi month one.
@_date: 2018-09-25 04:51:52
Shhhh.... don’t talk about economics to them. They can’t comprehend it and will only get frustrated at you for bringing it up.
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:41:37
Lol and this is supposed to be trustless. SFYL

Still didn’t depreciate as quickly as crypto. If anything, a Rolex seems to be a better store of value than crypto. Look at the second hand market for Daytonas.

People won’t have the incentives to spend it because it’s deflationary, why would someone use it if they speculate that it would go up in value?
@_date: 2018-08-13 14:15:29
Deflationary money doesn't work, we tried this before. Let's look at your scenario, bitcoin is the only thing we use, or some other kind of deflationary money, if people anticipate that things will go down in value, that the currency value will go up. Consumer demand will go down, meaning they will spend less on things. The whole economy will start slowing down, and what happens? Things get even cheaper, people will spend even less. What happens when we buy less things? Businesses go under, what happens when businesses go under? You make less money. It's a negative spiral. That's why central banks around the world has inflation targets, the whole point is to avoid people not spending money, you WANT them to spend money. So far with what we have seen, economies often do well when we have a mild inflation.

1 year later........... HE IS STILL BROKE

How about don’t buy bitcoin because you will make some random internet ancap rich, with the risk of losing half of your money? 
@_date: 2018-08-25 18:07:55
So I suggest everyone here to get themselves into a coma.
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:50:32
And tether isn’t? Lol. You can label whatever coin as fraud but before you throw that shit out, look at what’s on the market right now. Anything that’s not bitcoin has zero use cases and are just literal scams. Designed with the intention to make the developers rich.
@_date: 2019-02-11 02:06:04
And it’s the most trivial shit too, fking beer? Really? We have seen SOME pubs accepting bitcoin through a third party processor.  Even some porn websites accept bitcoin. They do it because they can charge you a much higher premium and then convert it to real money with the payment processor.
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:23:15
Jesus Christ can we stop with these coping posts? If you really don’t care about the price drops or a bear market, then don’t post about it. We get it, you got those “strong hands” and has zero creativity with memes. Every time the price drops we get like dozens of these unoriginal shitposts.
@_date: 2019-01-22 19:25:10
Also a very niche and limited use case. This only happens because of the political instability of PRC. You also need expats that are willing to work in PRC AND has to send money back home. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:26:30
It’s really funny to see how many in this space were going off on the oppressive state and laws. Yet here they are saying how they want to sue manipulators and short sellers. Make up your fucking mind people, what’s it gonna be? They would say anything and change their views in a split second to dream about getting rich. That’s crypto.
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:40:51
Don't worry, I will set up a huge buy wall at 5 dollars.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:58:30
Ok, c’mon you can’t be serious about the APU. Those aren’t meant for gaming.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:20:49
That’s too much knowledge for this sub, we only “Buy the dip and HODL” we will all be rich right?
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:40:08
Fair enough.
I wasn't trying to criticize people who buy either APU or GPU, didn't mean to come across as an ass.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:16:35
Well then you will have to be happy with mediocre performance. You can’t just compare an APU to a GPU because you can do some gaming with the APU. It’s like pointing at a Toyota Camry and say that it’s the same thing as a Mercedes E Class, because both are midsize 4 door sedans. It’s different. You are comparing apples to oranges.
One is meant for people who are price sensitive and wanting to build a cheap gaming rig at the cost of mediocre performance, one is meant for people who are less price sensitive and wanting high performance. These two products aren’t substitutes for the other.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:57:52
I don’t think people will pick up the sarcasm lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:28:53
Then when do you sell? From the sounds of it, you had zero plans before even entering the market. You did no risk management, you made a bad entry and left holding the bag. This doesn’t just apply to crypto, it applies to any markets.
Buy and hold becomes a problem when you have no intention on selling. If btc hits 50k you probably won’t be selling either, because you think it’s gong to keep going and going. After each cycle, yes, it might reach a new ath, but the money is irrelevant if you don’t close your position. Never sell? Never profit. Never profit? You are just gonna keep holding bags for life. 
You can sit and dream about lambos, but you can’t buy one and bring it to reality if you don’t plan your entries and exits. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:23:12
He made money from bitcoin alright, we all know that, I do think everyone should be a bit more cautious about his “calls” because he is defending Theranos, he also refused to accept that he basically got scammed by Elizabeth Holmes.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:49:43
Well if you are a miner, then your perspective is different than the people who bought btc at 15k with real money and are still bag holding (and believe in holding). It’s great that you started mining in 2011, but you are well into profits even if it tanks below 5k. Can’t say the same for those who bought the top. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:33:43
No you don’t understand! But!..... but muh bitcoin libertarian narrative! 
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:50:26
The problem here is that even the person who sits behind the “understanding bitcoin” booth is a speculator as well. Personally I know a few of these individuals that does their own “startup” or some kind of blockchain/ crypto consultancy business. They may know a bit more about the coding and blockchain itself but you get down to it they are just another “hodler”. But instead of throwing money that they could afford to lose they threw their whole career AND savings account into the market.
