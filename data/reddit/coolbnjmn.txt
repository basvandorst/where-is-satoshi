2mb blocks doesn’t necessarily translate to smaller fees. Bigger blocks can speed up the network, but at the cost of decentralization. The smallest fees will be from currencies built for exchange, like XRP by Ripple. That’s there you’ll get really small fees.

BitStamp is not on the list of exchanges keen on the fork, and I like their exchange services a lot. They have an iOS app, works pretty well!

Which is odd when BCH volume is down 10 fold since the ATH in August, days after the coin began lol.

“Il s’agit de « jetons électroniques ».” In référence to Bitcoin. Translates to: “it’s basically a digital token”, I love that this was published by the French government. Great find original poster! More government acceptance is good, lots of credibility from these big agencies!

Because that’s not the intended purpose of Bitcoin. Use Ripple for something like that, Bitcoin has 21 million total coins, meant to be a hard asset once fully distributed. Low fees are awesome and I’m not against low fees, but not at the expense of the core utility of Bitcoin. I’m not a miner, and you are right, I can’t mine economically without dropping some major dough on some special hardware. But arguing for changes that make that even worse doesn’t make sense to me. It’s already bad, but why make it worse? You are right though, in that the cost is already there and won’t likely go back in any easy way.
