I'm no expert so can't say but my guess is it would probably be extremely hard or at the very least horribly inconvenient.

I live in Korea. It's actually easy to get, you can buy and sell bitcoin instantly. The regulations coming are making it harder though, especially for newcomers. They aren't even letting newcomers buy, so I'm not sure what will happen in the future.

Well one company I know isn't issuing new deposit accounts so basically if you didn't already have an account before like December, you can't fill your account with money, meaning you can't buy bitcoin. That's just one exchange I know, not even the biggest one, so idk how other exchanges are operating.

Idk but I live in Korea and I'm screaming, this is insane. It's over 19million krw right now, approaching 20 probably in a few hours.

I think mostly old people, property owners, and professional traders, but Koreans in general are known to like saving and investing. From what I've heard and my general knowledge people are buying btc because the return rates are better than interest from the banks which has greatly been reduced in the past few years. But yeah I'm no expert, I'm just here for the ride to the moon.

I live in Korea, this is just my guess. Many Koreans put large amounts of money in banks hoping to earn some interest on it, but in recent years interest rates have been dropping like crazy, thus there's been demand for more profitable investments.  Especially with the recent spike in the price since spring, I think it would explain why a lot of people are putting their money in to bitcoin now hoping to turn a profit. There have been days when I've seen the price crash hard in other markets but here in Korea it remained quite stable until the last two or so weeks.
