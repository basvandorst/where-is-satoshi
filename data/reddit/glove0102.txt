I bought 2 pizzas with Bitcoin back in 2017. Now it would’ve only been worth $15.

Yeah I had the Litecoins at $1.50 and couldn't believe they were at $3.50 so I sold them haha.

I was reading a thread on Bitcoin talk where a guy was talking about how he sold his 15,000 BTC for about $0.003 in 2010.

How would lost bitcoins prevent it from dropping to zero? Did you think about it?

$670 should be plenty for divorce papers.

There are ETF's that are short the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones, so take a look into those. You can buy SDS and that goes up 2x what the S&amp;P goes down.

Not saying you can't do it, but anything could happen to Bitcoin in 30 years since it is so new. It could be worth nothing. I'd highly advise against it.

I was gonna say, there is no way he was talking about bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:06:33
I'm not sorry, sorry.
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:30:58
Oh boy this means the price is gonna sky rocket.

No. Bitcoin was initially funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.

Copied from the ARPANET wikipedia page and replaced it with the word Bitcoin.

We'll start a crypto called Bircoin. Issue 1/999,999th of one. Trade it for $1. Then bam, Bircoin will also never reach $1M.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:46:52
or just issue lots of coins and hype it based on the premise that John McAfee said they'd be worth $1M each.
