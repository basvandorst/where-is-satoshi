Yes, her motivation is quite strange. She is clearly very intelligent but not at all impartial or level headed. Her blogs sound like spin doctoring.
In a strange way it makes me more bullish when I see very intelligent people struggle with the cognitive dissonance brought on by thinking about bitcoin. When you see someone like Izabella desperately try and conjure up any obscure reason to trash it without a balanced consideration of the pros and cons, you know there's something very interesting (if not world changing) going on.

Thanks for these, clearly shows a grass roots global trend building. Have a donut on me @_date: 2014-12-12 15:43:16

Ah, I see, kylesdad72 is one of buttcoiners. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 14:27:04
Thanks, mate! But have it back and tip someone on a random non bitcoin related sub!

Gillian Tett is US Managing Editor at the Financial Times, a big deal in the global financial press. This was printed in the weekend magazine, so would have reached a lot of people. Ha, maybe we should tip her on 
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:36:25
Oh, and if you do spread the love, come back here and tell us who you tipped and what their response was!
@_date: 2014-12-18 22:02:54
Thanks for the support. Yeah, I read into a fairly negative emotional reaction to 
Changetip/Bitcoin which the author was trying to justify (the title was very emotional). As well as finding it tacky he also threw in the unfounded accusation/speculation they would sell data.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:29:03
Some people just don't like change (pun intended!)
If I can penetrate to the heart of this very long opinion piece, you don't like online tipping because you find it distasteful? Oh well, don't take part. I think it will be a useful tool in democratising journalism and content. It will help empower the individual author over the large media organisation. Man can't live on up votes alone.

Is it a ponzi scheme if the main app is to give it away? Have a dollar @_date: 2014-12-10 09:09:59
Like your first 2 paragraphs. Spot on.

Agree. Price is nothing to worry about, unless you're a get quick rich trader. The value of the bitcoin blockchain may not actually be in owning the actually bitcoins themselves in the end. The speculation frenzy this year has now established the network which can be built on. Changetip is just an early, easy application. We should see a bunch of cool non currency related applications being established on the blockchain next year. I think this is a good article:

Yeah, I remember at the time everyone was getting excited about all the applications that could be built on top of the global network of beanie babies ownership. It was the most efficient method of asset transfer of its time. To this day I don't understand why it didn't take off :)

First time I've paid BTC to watch content. It worked just fine. Well done.
@_date: 2014-12-16 14:48:43
You made me nearly crap my pants. Had to quickly go check the price

Great work. Take a nap @_date: 2015-01-19 17:24:29
I wanted to ask him something, so I just emailed him and he replied. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:47:24
I made some in app purchases, but there's no option to pay in Bitcoin. I asked the developer about this. Apple won't let him accept Bitcoin because they take 30% of in -app revenues!
I'm going to recommend to him he sets up a QR code, or a Twitter/reddit account so we can tip him. This is a great faucet.

The UKs lifeboat rescue service started accepting Bitcoin donations early last year. I donated. Saw them do a great job last time I went surfing.

Kaminska seems to be staking her career on crypto blowing up. She's written a series of blogs about it, on number 59 I think. I think she might also be writing a book on it. Eventually she will be proven right - doomsayers always are - when the sun supernovas and the earth is wiped out.

And that one specific thing is to process blockchain transactions? Sorry, I should have been more specific. I wasn't arguing that computing power could be used for anything else, only that it is a huge amount of computing power for an unimaginable amount of blockchain related applications to be potentially built on.
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:02:25
Do you worry about your profitability in the future when the Bitcoin reward drops, or do transaction fees cover this? 
Are transaction fees currently part of you income, if so, what's the split between mining reward and transaction fees?

Good to know :)
Some say the world will end in fire, some in ice, others yet say it will just disappear down a big black hole.

Well done. I was posting as Scowl on that article. There seems to be quite a bit of coverage in the economist/FT recently that actually shows an openness to understand the technology. Who knows how this is going to end up, but it's going to be something transformative that impacts most people's lives.

What ever happened to tipping projects targeting other reddits, or even other social media?

Why don't you just pitch in with millionaire makers?
