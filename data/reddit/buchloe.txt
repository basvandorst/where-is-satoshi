GREAT explanation
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:24:53
Totally.  One main issue right now is simply not having enough graphic designers, web designers, and marketers involved. It's just tech people right now. We could really use people focused on ease-of-use working in tandem with them. We'll get there. However, rock-solid code comes first.
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:50:42
Oh, sweet.  I will look into that,  thanks
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:11:02
I agree.  But someday we will have to devise onramps that aren't shady. There isn't a lot of focus on it right now because coinbase etc are too easy. Unfortunately,  they require kyc. I have faith that the problem will one day be elegantly addressed.
Even running a node is pretty niche right now,  and synching your hardware wallets through it is even harder. These are all obstacles to mainstream adoption and ease of use. They are design problems that must be addressed, and slowly but surely are. In the meantime,  they're working adequately enough for those who know what they're doing and know how to be careful.

Doubt which part?  I mean,  at least he has addressed them publicly with a very specific,  clear standpoint on the issue. He's supportive of the innovations, and he's said so.
Doubt his supporters will switch to Yang? Yeah,  probably not.  Though a fair amount will, I hope.  I probably will,  but then again I'm not a die-hard Trump supporter. I just didn't want Hillary.

Been using coinbase for two years,  just now realizing that you don't have to do anything extra to have a gdax account. Fees are so cheap.  Just gonna set small buys at support levels increasing in amount as the price drops lower,  if it does. That way I don't have to watch it around the clock

Well thanks for doing your part. Honestly I work with a ton of brilliant artists, but none of them have any idea why they should care about bitcoin. They all have apple computers and use google for everything. Security and privacy aren't their concerns. I think the layperson working 9 to 5 just doesn't currently care because they don't have to. They're bad with money,  they don't understand money,  and they have a bad relationship with it. 
I know maybe 5 people who were really into crypto prior to 2017, in fact,  they got me interested in it. But they were just in for the investment, so they got disillusioned when it crashed. I'm really the only person I know who stayed interested even when it dropped and have only learned more about it every day since then. 
I hope anyone with interest in the technology, even if they aren't engineers,  will do whatever they can. Use lightning,  beta test new features, offer feedback,  run nodes, and just generally get in where they fit in, because we can all help.

I had a ton of litecoin. I looked at it and saw that historically its been about 100 to 1 compared to btc at market lows, and about 50 to 1 or less at market peaks. But litecoin lagged for so long while bitcoin climbed and climbed,  I got cold feet. Swapped ltc for btc around 15,000$. Then bitcoin stops moving and ltc hits 50 to 1. I was the bear in this animation.

@_date: 2019-03-04 16:31:28
Mm I don't remember if there's a debit card option or not.  I mean,  you're dealing one-on-one with a seller/ buyer,  not the exchange itself. And bisq tries to offer only the most secure, irreversible payment options possible (so they avoid things like PayPal).
That's the primary bug/feature with decentralized exchanges to my understanding. You're not buying from a middle man,  it's directly peer to peer, so you don't put money on the exchange.  It's just an order book, and facilitates connections,  like local bitcoin. 
There are many ways to do transactions using bisq (and I've only recently set it up and not yet done any trades on it,  so do your own diligence), from direct deposits, money orders,  cash in person, etc. All take place outside of the app,  except arbitration which uses a third network user through multisig. 
It's definitely not as easy/ convenient as using coinbase. Hopefully it will be in the future.  But then again,  bitcoin isn't as easy or convenient as using a Visa card. The issue is,  how bad do you want to avoid the mainstream alternatives. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 19:33:11
What do you mean about fiat needing a security deposit in BTC? Haven't actually used it yet,  just been watching a lot of videos and haven't run across that info. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 21:08:19
Oh,  so it's only a problem if you've never bought bitcoin before so can't provide the deposit. Whoah,  I use samurai but didn't know they had a mixing service.
I thought only the seller had to put up some btc as a deposit,  and that the buyer had to put up cash?

Not a loss until you sell 
@_date: 2018-10-03 04:45:40
Depends on how you look at it, and what your frame of reference is. If dollars are most important to you,  then yes you lost some at that point in time, if you sell. But if you sell your bitcoin,  then you lose your bitcoin. 
You lose money the moment you drive a car off the lot. But now you have a car,  and you knew that going in.  Though that car doesn't have the potential to multi explode in dollar value. Except for the fact that it gets you to your job.

...or you sold at a loss,  and later it exploded, and you still felt like a fucking retarded idiot. Don't spend more than you can afford to lose. Don't expect it not to drop,  and hey, it also just might go up. Welcome to risk. 
If you don't want to lose your money,  keep it in a coffee can in the ground. Maybe it will be worth more in twenty years! 
Yes.  If you think it's going to collapse,  get back what you can before you lose more. But otherwise,  ride the wave and wait it out. I'm a holding, not trading. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 04:15:20
I mean,  that's not the only reason I have a job.  But I believe in and want to support bitcoin,  so I buy it with the extra money i would otherwise blow on useless crap, dollar cost average and hold.  I want it to succeed, I think it's the best chance at free market money we have.  If it fails,  I won't be bitter even if I lose a lot. Gotta try.

@_date: 2019-08-16 04:56:59
If you already have a coinbase account,  you have a coinbase pro account essentially. You just log in.  I think bank account is already synched, you don't have to do anything extra.  You can put  money directly in through your bank,  or transfer funds from coinbase. To withdraw BTC, you have to first move it to your coinbase account and then you can send it wherever you want. But fees are MUCH cheaper and you can set automatic buys and sells to trigger at any price you want,  so you don't have to constantly monitor the price.
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:44:54
As far as I know,  there are developer options and ways to program your own firmware for the device. I just don't know anything about that stuff,  so i'm not speaking to it.
Trezor and ledger typically communicate with company servers to relay your transactions to the blockchain. Coldcard doesn't have servers,  but is usually used on electrum wallet,  which does, but then you become aware of things like electrum personal server and the importance of running a node. Most trezor or ledger users are oblivious to even what a node is.
Yeah,  you have to trust a manufacturer in some way. They, after all,  are the ones who made the device. Though coldcard is completely open source. You are welcome to manufacture your own. In comparison to ledger at least, they are very open about their manufacture process and all the steps they take to keep themselves out of the loop as much as possible when it comes to your information, your keys, how your keys are generated, and who knows that info. 
To use trezor or ledger,  you have to plug your device into a computer and enter your pin either on the computer screen or on the device, all while connected to the computer. Most trezor users even use a web interface to do all this.   
Coldcard doesn't have to connect to your computer ever,  or allow you to even initiate transactions on the computer unless you specifically choose to by plugging it in. And even then,  there are extra steps to logging in securely beyond what the others offer.
I just like it more.  If you look into the device and still prefer trezor or ledger,  more power to you.  I just have them all and like them all- it's the one I prefer.
@_date: 2019-08-28 04:39:16
No problem. And I hope im not being construed as hating on ledger or trezor.  They're both great. I used a trezor for 2 years before getting coldcard,  and I still use it. Any reputable hardware wallet is far better than bitcoin sitting on coinbase. 
That said,  the main nice thing about coldcard is even when you input your pin/passphrase, the device isn't even connected by usb. Ever. Not saying it's a huge risk, or any at all,  it's just one extra layer of "cold" that I like. 
It does passphrases pretty well. What do you mean by persistant? Not familiar with the term in this context.  
The way it works is- 
login using a 2 part pin, 12 character max. A phrase appears after the first string,  unique to your device and pin. If those words are unfamiliar, do not enter the second part of your pin- the device may have been replaced with another in order to phish the pin to your actual device.
You are now in the main wallet.  You can use this as your primary,  or as a decoy with minimal funds.  You can export a watch- only wallet file to the removable micro flash card to view on electrum,  etc., where you will initiate any spending. A spend requires exporting a partially signed TX from electrum to the flash card. Reinsert the SD into the cold card (all of which can be done without logging out or turning off device). Scan drive, sign transaction,  eject sd, insert it into computer,  read with electrum and transmit to the network. Done. 
(Fyi- if you like. You can plug coldcard in directly via usb if you aren't concerned about usb being a security risk, which it likely isn't.  It will function just like a trezor, you can confirm sign from the device, none of the SD hassle. Your discretion. )
To further enter a passphrase wallet,  just go to passphrase in the menu and type manually or select from seed words lists.  When done,  hit accept. You are in the hidden wallet. Every seed wallet (infinite number available) will generate a unique fingerprint string that you can write down and recheck every time you log in to make sure you typed your seed correctly. From here,  you have all the same wallet functionality as the main wallet.  To get back to the main wallet,  you do have to logout, disconnect and reconnect power (usb powered from phone charger) and retype your pin. About as inconvenient as relogging into the main wallet of a trezor.
I recommend watching some of world crypto network's videos on it if you're thinking of buying one and want more info. It's slightly more complicated than some wallets,  but I really like it. And fyi im not a spokesman,  I'm just a person who likes trying different crypto technology and hw wallets.
@_date: 2019-08-17 19:28:23
... what? I think he understands fine. Fact is,  if people don't see "the light" yet and accept it as a form of payment,  you can't buy stuff from them. Pretty simple.
Would if I could,  but I can't so I won't
@_date: 2019-08-28 04:07:17
Some people would prefer no connection at all. No usb connection at all. No web interface.  It's 50 bucks cheaper. Like I said though,  I like both.  Use what you want
@_date: 2019-08-30 14:22:18
You know,  it might ask for confirmation on device if you have it plugged in to usb. I don't actually know. It might be the nature of it being unplugged that it doesn't. I guess you'd have to export some kind of receiving addresses data,  put it on sd, and then confirm on the device that it matches with it, which I don't think it does.
On electrum,  you are working with a wallet file you generated in the device and saved on an SD card. You can encrypt that file.  You can re-export it any time,  and you will still get to the same wallet. From the start when you open the file in electrum,  it shows all receiving addresses linked to that offline generated wallet, and that list should be the same each time you re-export the wallet file. I don't know but maybe there'd be a way to hack electrum and change that list to show address for a different person's wallet? But then the funds at those addresses wouldn't match what you actually have, I think. I don't know enough to know if that's possible through hacking electrum, or if they'd have to hack the encrypted wallet file to do that. These are good questions.
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:32:07
I don't personally know. How would you want to modify it? There are firmware updates,  if that's what you're asking
@_date: 2019-08-27 04:41:24
World crypto network has tons of in-depth videos on it.
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:34:30
That's true.  I still just like it better. Trezor has to be connected to a computer to enter the pin, for instance. Even though the model has it's buttons on the device, it has to be connected by usb. Coldcard never has to.
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:48:07
No problem.  Can't believe I was on coinbase for two years before I realized I could just use coinbase pro... wasted tons of money in fees
@_date: 2019-08-27 04:37:14
I like it because A) the hardware never touches a computer B) You can use it directly with your node and never have to trust trezor or ledger's company servers C) the company is highly transparent and privacy focused D) their design aesthetic is awesome E) their other products and future projects are fantastic and forward-thinking F) you can literally set a false pin that will self destruct your device if under duress
@_date: 2019-08-14 22:27:24
At this point,  I get excited when it goes down. Im using coinbase pro because fees are low, and I just do like 30, 50, 100 bucks here and there in smaller dips of like 10%. Then I save my real buy-in money for those 40% corrections
@_date: 2019-08-27 04:31:08
Probably somewhat grandma proof. But,  if security of funds is the goal I believe it to be the safest option available

@_date: 2019-08-29 20:37:37
You do have to plug in the passphrase every time you log on,  if you want to get beyond the main seed wallet. It doesn't remember it, and it doesn't ask for it unless you specifically go into the menu and seelect the passphrase option.
Yes,  to my knowledge you can only generate receiving addresses from the external wallet. Do trezor and ledger generate them on the device? I've only ever generated them through the trezor web app... And no, the device doesn't ask you for confirmation to receive. I don't even think trezor even does this, does it? It only asks you to confirm if you are sending, that I recall.
@_date: 2019-08-26 18:41:21
I have trezor and ledger nano S and X. Coldcard is by far the best of all of them IMO. Too bad they didn't review it.  Made by the makers of OpenDime.
@_date: 2019-08-27 04:39:51
It just feels safer. They go above and beyond to give you security.  Favorite feature is partially signed transactions over micro SD card, so you never plug the device into a computer ever. Second favorite is duress pin that self destructs the device. Third favorite is just their ethos as a company
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:15:43
Yeah,  if I can actually get it downloaded I will. Core is taking weeks to download. Started out fine,  but it's getting exponentially slower the closer it gets to more recent blocks.  Don't know if it's my internet or the old laptop im using. I also wish electrum didn't show all your linked addresses right in plain sight. Also says if i encrypt my wallet file I can only open it by directly connecting the coldcard via usb, which would eliminate the security of using its flash card

We're still in the drop... we're going way past 20k if we approach it again. I doubt the next big drop will go as low as 10k.
Best time to dollar cost average is always now
(These are,  of course,  only opinions)
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:39:59
Shoot,  that's when you're supposed to buy!
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:34:03
I mean,  it could.  But in general, if bitcoin starts getting adopted more and more,  as it has throughout its history,  it will tend to continue to have higher highs and higher lows. For instance,  waiting to buy until it goes back down to $500, you will probably never buy bitcoin. If it drops to 10k again after going to, say,  50k, I'd definitely buy. But it could go to 100k and then never go below 20k ever,  and I mean ever,  again. Is the risk of missing out worth waiting to see?
The future upside potential is far greater than the downside risk in my eyes. Buy a thousand bucks worth, at worst lose a thousand bucks worth. But potentially gain ten thousand.
If you believe in the technology and are in for the long haul, IMO  your best bet is to DCA starting whenever you can,  and hodl through thick and thin, adding to it regularly as you can, and have a little rainy day cash to throw in when it really dips. Everytime I've screwed around waiting for a pullback,  I never got one, and I ended up buying at a higher price than if I'd just bought small amounts regularly on a schedule. Yeah,  keep cash on hand for a sudden drop,  but first and foremost secure a position in as "early days" as you can and keep it.

I love that coinbase offers free swaps on their app now.  Bought a bunch of LTC when the ratio was like 90 LTC per BTC. Now it's ~50/1, and I swapped it all in for more BTC. If it drops low again,  probably gonna swap some BTC for LTC and try to keep adding to my holdings that way. I'm not super investment savvy, but that seems like a reasonable way to keep stacking (in addition to dollar cost averaging),  and there's no fee to exchange crypto to crypto, vs. selling for cash. I assume tax-wise that trades are probably still taxable events though.

Well, several past presidents would disagree with you,  but it doesn't really matter in the end. My opinion is different,  but at least we agree that we do not currently operate in a free market. Whether the US government controls the world monetary system,  or whether bankers do,  or whether it's an incestuous combination of both bankers and elected officials around the world,  it's currently not the free market that chooses its own money. That is,  until Bitcoin came along, or one of it's descendants. That's the hope,  anyway.

Hoarders gonna hoard. They did it with gold. At least gold had to be spent to use it. Dollars can just be printed when they want to spend them. Plus,  hoarding bitcoin doesn't generate interest.
I'd prefer a totally free market as opposed "democratic" divvying up of stockpiles of "excessive" wealth,  but that's just me. 
As long as bitcoin are held unused,  they're out of circulation.  Everyone else can still use the rest of the bitcoin and divide them up smaller to compensate for what's out of circulation/ lost. Their worth will go up.  Yeah,  the rich can then dump on the market,  but then the price goes down and everyone can get more for their money/ work.  And if the rich ever do spend them somewhere,  there they go, back into the market. 
Hoarding = saving = deflation.

I think they're more casting stones at the trump administration than Elon. Don't take it too personally,  bud.

If you pay directly from your bank account, delivery takes like 8 days but fees are less than half that

That's a fucking brilliant way to waste money

Well,  they can't inflate bitcoin to bail out banks either.  Unless they somehow monetize a unit "backed by" bitcoin and start excessively printing that.

First rule- hold your own private keys, don't use an exchange for storage

Unless you're mining, you're pretty much gonna be buying it if you want to obtain it

Yeah. Anyone else I wouldn't tell. Talk goes around,  and I'd only trust someone who really knows the danger of that.

... neither he nor his wife seem to be upset at losing the money.  They wanted to simplify their lives and be more family oriented. They're holding their bitcoin.  They don't seem desperate for higher price,  they seem to all be enjoying the experiment.  Yes,  that is not for most people. It is a very risky move and not one to look up to and replicate,  unless you really want that. The key is that neither his wife nor kids seem anything but supportive and happy. They aren't under a bridge.  They have a sponsorship,  a nice minimal mobile home to live in. I lived in a van for a year.  It was awesome.  I saved up so much money with reduced expenses,  and had a lot less to worry about. Plus,  he's probably still ahead,  considering he bought in between 1 and 9k. And he's hodling, so he still has most of the coins if it does go higher. It's their life.

Better to weigh it against a basket of goods than the dollar. It's only the moon if actual purchasing power of btc in goods explodes

Ah, gotcha

Or send a bunch money to someone in China for like 10 cents. Or escape your plummeting Venezuelan currency. Or if you don't trust banks. Or if you want diversification.  Or if you support the technology. What purpose do stocks have?

Check the tops of soda machines. You'll find a dusty one stuck up there sometimes.  
For real though,  I want very much to support and use Bisq, for instance. But the network is currently puny. None of us want to go through exchanges,  kyc etc. But there's just no other rapid, consistent way. Waiting for the day my employer has a btc pay option
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:49:54
No, that's just treading water and not losing the money you would have lost holding dollars. Moon is when you can buy more goods than you could before. Moon comes from mass adoption and influx of new users,  not from just buying more of a hyperinflating currency

... you think the president is the one who decides QE or not? He's just the one putting a nice spin on it for the public.  He has very little say in fed policy.

You lost your money when you bought your car, too. But... you have a car. If you sell your bitcoin,  you lose your bitcoin. But you get dollars. That's how exchange works.

Lol, "the advantages it has over sovereign currency". I think you got it backwards,  bud. It has advantages as a sovereign currency.

But where do you take it if you need to spend it while overseas?   Bitcoin ATMs aren't exactly on every corner, and neither are businesses that accept bitcoin.

What is anything? Every single product and commodity out there has not only users,  but investors and speculators.  Laptops. Wheat. Coffee. Shoes. Some people invest in apple,  purely with profit in mind. Others use the computers for practical use. Some people grow or buy wheat to sell it for more later.  Others eat it. The early supporters make money, build the network,  and try advertise the uses of the item. Just because everyone you know only buys bitcoin to profit,  doesn't mean bitcoin isn't useful to people in Venezuela as actual money as their national currency collapses. Many early adopters and programmers are using people's 'get-rich-quick' speculation money to support their lives while advancing the technology of a project they truly believe in.

The only people I talk about it with are others who have it and understand. That way we share strategies and tech advancement information to help each other. After all, one day i'll be on a yacht celebrating, and want some good friends as company!

I'm just saying,  when people say moon they aren't talking about just keeping up with inflation.  They're talking about getting rich in terms of exploding their purchasing power
