I have the same observation, but hopefully somebody more unbiased would confirm this.  
OP seems to be trying to drum up as much attention as possible to the matter, and it's a hastily written TL;DR above... that doesn't really help that communities get their misinformation from these two-sentence summaries that are logically fallacious.

I usually look first via basic file analysis -- very unlikely to turn up anything but some people like to sprinkle additional pointers there.
* Scanned the beginning of the file in hex editor, did not find anything.
* Attempted to extract strings from the actual file itself.  The original 7mb file produces way too many strings, so pruned down to alphanumeric.  This also too produced too many strings so I perused strings of length 5 and still did not find anything useful.  You can replicate this with SysInternals tool strings(64) via the following command - "strings64.exe -n 5 g4rbvtbiwry01.png | findstr /r "\^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$" &gt; bitcoinstringsAlphaNumeric6.txt"
Putting it here since it might save folks some time to skip these basic steps... any other ideas?

You know, if you phrased this nicely, people might have actually attempted to explain the nuances so you understand.  
Don't expect something like this to happen overnight without major debate and discussion and buy in from some of the bigger players.  
The beauty of the system is that the choices are not left up to a manipulative few; people will speak up regarding the issues following such major decisions and fork the project off if necessary.  
You try comparing a supposed 9 million dollar dump with the corruption and manipulation that is going on on the scale of billions if you look at major fiat and markets.  This is the technology that gives you a way to fight back as opposed to some government authorities making decisions that are for their own good or the good of those corporations who are filling their pockets.
I guess if you don't believe in that, then you have no reason to believe in bitcoin to begin with, and I rest my case.

Logically speaking, he's lying, "f.u. crypto I believed you" vs "bought in 2012. a decent amount"... you can at least expect someone who held for years to recognize where we are in the long term trendline... because surely someone can't be stupid enough to expect endless probabilistic growth.

Translation: the writer who was forced to write the article to align with the organization's agenda/sponsors throws something like this in.

Could you explain the first paragraph in more detail?  If the price starts dropping, how do you know when to buy?
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:01:26
Not sure i fully understand, but at a point like this (where people are in a state of panic since the price has been steadily going down for a while), the intention is to panic / urge folks into put up their coins for sale lower than the actual value -- in order to drive the price DOWN.
Say people are buying/selling at 330.  You put up a huge wall at 320 that you know will not be fulfilled for a while based on trading volume.
Now, someone comes along who wants to sell, notices a large order at 320 that likely isn't going to be fulfilled for a while, so he prices the coins below that, say 319.  Enough people do that, and these trades get fulfilled while the wall stays up.  Now you withdraw your order, but the recent transactions happen to have been traded at 319.
Any new orders at that point are likely to be around 319 even though before the wall, everything was trading at 330.  
You can now make a large buy to scoop up anything from 319-330 at a discount.  OR you can move the wall down to 300 and pressure the price further down to 299.

Well, then you oughta at least give a good explanation on why this is a problem.  I guarantee you you can find a forum where people will listen.

Can you explain how bitcoin is not debt?  It is created out of thin air AND it is generally exchanged for using money (which is debt to begin with).
