In addition to what others have said about self regulation of a market using reputation, etc., there is also the fact that recourse is more difficult with Bitcoin. With no bank, no chargebacks,  etc, and its global nature, it can be difficult and time consuming, if even possible, to be made whole when one gets screwed. Getting their attention in a public forum serves both to warn others of the issue and to (hopefully) get some traction on resolution.

Do you mean proof-of-concept?

Think of it in the same kind of terms as man hours.  The balance of a wallet times the days it has been there, whether it got there via mining or another transaction.  You destroy these accumulated (imaginary) units when you perform a transaction.  It's just a measure of how much and how fast bitcoin is moving around in the network, a measure of total transaction volume over time.

This is more true when insurers cover things that statistically shouldn't be insurable (often due to regulation). When only insuring against things that are unlikely to happen, they make their money by having accurate actuarial tables, they can pay out the majority of valid claims because the rates they're charging as premiums cover those statistically rare events. Yes, they can make more money by being dishonest and not paying out claims, but it's not an inherent necessity of the business model.

For what it's worth, I used BTC to pay for an account with iPredator.se, a VPN service run by the pirate bay guys.  It was a good experience.  The only complaint was that they waited for 6 confirmations on a relatively small transaction, but that really wasn't a big inconvenience.  Everything else went smoothly.
Also, you have done something.  Calling them out here will help other people make informed decisions, and may illicit a reaction.  Perhaps you won't get the same reaction as a chargeback, but BitPay may be able to help you more with that end of things.

It's worth noting that this only applies to crowd funded securities. If the reward to the backer isn't a share of ownership or some other financial instrument, none of this applies, at least, that's my interpretation. 
Kickstarter in particular has always disallowed this practice anyway, I'm sure to avoid running afoul of the sec.
Still unfortunate.

One major issue he doesn't seem to recognize is that regardless of their intent for the breadth of a regulation, if it can be interpreted more broadly, it will be later by someone else.  This happens all the time, the complexities of legal language keep lots of people employed, and lets lots of judges make law.

Oh come on...  Please stop calling it a VIRTUAL currency.  It's a digital currency, or an electronic currency, or a crypto currency.
Do we recognize that Bitcoin is money?  The first formal definition of Virtual from Merriam Webster is: "being such in essence or effect though not formally recognized or admitted."  Yes, there are other definitions that support the current use, but the connotation of the word implies that Bitcoin isn't a real good or isn't recognized as a currency.

There are unfriendly people and trolls in every sub. Ignore them. You did get many valid, straightforward answers to your question from others, but didn't seem to interact with them much. You're more likely to have a friendly, helpful dialog if you engage with the friendly answers rather than the unfriendly ones. In any case, while I'm sorry you got some negative responses, that's probably not the metric by which you should make your investment / spending decisions. And if inflation of supply is actually a concern to you, why would you even consider doge?
For what it's worth here's my thought on the original question you asked.
The rate of creation slows over time, effectively stopping at 21 million (it makes an asymptotic approach).  This supply is known, predictable, and dependable.
If the supply hadn't been plentiful in the beginning, it may have been harder to gain much traction or may not have created the distribution and liquidity necessary for this stage of growth. To date the rate of adoption is still greater than the rate of creation, so it's value has been increasing as a general tend. Unless Bitcoin is supplanted this will continue. 
You can also subtract from the supply all the coins that have been lost. Some of these are known, some are not. This will continue to happen though, destroying coin when people forget passwords, lose paper wallets, wipe cell phones, die while holding in a brainwallet, and even destroy them intentionally in proof-of-burn transactions. All of these will continue to happen, decreasing the net effective supply, even if only by a little. 
The USD is created on a whim, with little warning. If you're using government-provided inflation numbers to assume 2% that's probably a little low since they exclude some of the most important factors from those calculations. Many calculate the real rate of inflation as over 4%. With the next halving Bitcoin will probably be inflating at a slower rate than the USD. At the same time demand for Bitcoin is growing while demand for the dollar is dropping internationally.
I hope that answers your question satisfactorily and draws some connections for you. I (and others) am happy to answer more questions.

Given your replies, it doesn't sound like you're asking for help, it sounds like you're complaining, demanding a refund, and actively opposing the advice people are giving you.
This parent comment about the possibility of malware was the first thing that came to my mind.  If this is what happened, the fault is not with humble bundle, nor coinbase; you would have cause to be unhappy, but not with them.  Contact coinbase to see if they actually received any funds from you, then act based on what you learn.

Wouldn't DOLLAR cost averaging be investing the same number of dollars in Bitcoin each period?
For a round number, say it was $1000 and you bought your first around about 1/12/13 and got 1 BTC.  Using the prices you gave...
1/12/2013 - $1000 for 1 BTC
1/1/2014 - $1000 for 1.23 BTC
1/2/2014 - $1000 for 1.05 BTC
1/3/2014 - $1000 for 1.76 BTC
1/4/2014 - $1000 for 2.09 BTC
1/5/2014 - $1000 for 2.17 BTC
1/6/2014 - $1000 for 1.58 BTC
1/7/2014 - $1000 for 1.57 BTC
1/8/2014 - $1000 for 1.67 BTC
At the end of this, you're in for $9,000 and own 14.12 BTC.  At the price of $485, your BTC is valued at $6,848.  You're down $2,152, or 23.9% (a lower percentage than if buying varying dollar values).  Now, to break even, you need the price to increase 31.4%.
No strategy that only includes buying will protect you from a price that trends downward over time - you're still going to be holding more and more of an asset that's losing value.  If it does rise in the future, you will have made more on DCA, but if it doesn't you'll have lost more too.

Illicit goods are the obvious use, and will probably be most of the early use, but I'm optimistic that it will be used for other things before long. 
As a seller, it's appealing to avoid the fees and censorship that happens on platforms like eBay. If you're a very small seller, or new to selling, I believe it will be faster to get up and going with than many e-commerce solutions (I've built e-commerce sites on 5 different platforms and what I've seen of openbazaar looks like it should be easier to get going with. I don't know if this will happen or not, but I'd love to see it as a platform for cottage industry, encroaching on the territory held by eBay and etsy.
As a buyer, I think at first it will be a novelty, but as the number of sellers grow I think it will become more useful. Speaking for myself, I like the idea of transacting directly with someone, without having to have permission. I've never purchased anything illicit, nor do I plan to, but I'm excited about the platform, and I think some others will be too, who will help make up the early adopters that will make the userbase functional. 
Also keep in mind the applications for people wanting to transact goods that are legal but frowned upon, those things that are being targeted by operation checkpoint, etc. Adult products, gun parts, e-cigs, etc. I also see the potential for a decent bit of precious metals trade; while it may not be completely anonymous, it's private enough to satisfy a lot of people.

I watched one of the hearings when the ban on cannabis for Bitcoin was discussed and these guys presented their solution. I may have interpreted incorrectly, but it sounded like you Could ONLY buy cannabis with Bitcoin acquired through their system, which takes a lot Of ID info and would identify you as having visited a pot shop. Granted, if you can take that Bitcoin out of their system and store and use it elsewhere (as the article states) that's definitely a positive. If anyone knows this to be incorrect (regarding not spending other Bitcoin through their system) please correct me.

That's really not the issue. Whether fiat or real money, if it's being used as money (for commerce), you're not doing Burning Man right. 
The point is decommodification and decommercialization, not shunning unsound money. The economy at Burning Man is a gifting economy, based on being responsible for yourself, but helping or enriching others voluntarily and without expectation of any remuneration.
@_date: 2015-08-23 03:10:22
Looking at their schedule of events, this seems like pretty legitimate education. There are all kinds of educational events at Burning Man, and these all look perfectly appropriate. As long as they're not selling something this is totally within both the spirit and letter of the rules.

When you said "replace your rent with more BTC soon after paying it" my interpretation was buying more BTC to replace that which you spent.  My point was that it may be difficult to buy more BTC if your income is in BTC.

Mt Gox was originally a Magic The Gathering Online eXchange, from what I understand they started taking BTC for magic cards, then ended up just doing BTC after that was the bulk of their trading.

This was not an internal transaction.  I was not transfering to another Mt Gox account.  It did eventually hit the blockchain after about 5 hours.
@_date: 2013-08-13 04:32:19
Just now tried to do a withdrawal - to someone else.  The funds have come out, but nothing has hit the blockchain.
What's more, I accidentally hit confirm twice on the withdraw form and it processed it twice.  The transaction was for almost half of the value of my wallet, so now I have just about none left.
I contacted their support and was told that transactions could take up to 24 hours to clear.  Funny they didn't mention that on the withdrawal form.
I'm done with them.  Anyone have an exchange to recommend?  I'm looking at BitStamp.

Lost the password to a wallet with about 5BTC in it, if I remember correctly.
I created the wallet and took down a seed from which I could generate/remember the password in a file I keep.  When I came back to it several months later, I discovered that the file apparently hadn't been saved and I was SOL.
When I went to access it wasn't even to spend it, but rather to print out paper wallet info in case anything happened.  Too late.
I've still got the wallet file, in the hopes that I'll somehow miraculously remember it, but I don't think it's going to happen.
