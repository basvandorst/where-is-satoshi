Amongst obvious charity donations I would make it so my Father isn’t worried about his pension any more, he’d be able to retire now rather than doing a few more years of 12 hours self-employed days in the cold with a fused ankle.

Can someone explain to me what happened at this stage?
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:15:06
Ah.  Got ya, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:36:47
GDAX isn't available in my region apparently :( 
Not OP, but i'm from the UK.  I've purchased on Coinbase but you're against them...anything else that i could use with lower fees?

This question gets asked a hell of a lot and there’s a massive FAQ at the top of this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:42:25
I noticed it was fairly high.  On £200 purchase i was charged £7.67...
Then charged to put it in to my wallet.. 
Small price to pay really with how it's rising though.

It’s not even December yet! This has been our family Christmas movie since I was a kid! It’s awesome. 
Waiting a few years then using BTC to put in a pool!

I’ve never been able to understand this. I even read a kind of ELI5 of it. 
Can someone ELI’m an actual 5 year old.  What does either side of that line represent?

I feel for him a bit, I'm new to BTC and have only invested a minuscule amount in comparison to what some people have and I'm watching it on my other monitor whenever I'm sat at my PC...  Then I'm checking it on my phone if I'm out and about.
If I'd have taken out £35k in loans and invested it, any small dip would have put a pretty big dent in it and it would worry me a little.
Basically what I'm trying to say is BTC going down 3% on £35k would scare me much more than BTC going down 3% on £350.
It's still a risk either way, I'm not taking out £30k in loans like this fella though!

 - theres a screenshot.
Or am i doing this incorrectly?
*EDIT: I was doing it incorrectly, if i do BTC/GBP it allows me to do it...
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:24:30
This is why I'm not overly annoyed that I didn't get in really early, I'd have done the same.
But you're regretting it now because you'd cash out for $40k for money towards your house, then you'd feel exactly the same in a couple of years if/when it's at £100k...
Don't dwell on the past dude x

Little bit. Bought £200 at 7250 a hour or so ago and it’s dropped a bit. 
At least I’m on this rollercoaster now.

OTC being Over the counter, right?
What would happen to the market if this would to happen? Would prices rise or plummet? Or stay the same?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:49:34
Ahh ok.  I forgot how much it charged me but i purchased $263.47 and by the time it was in my wallet it says it was $249.96.  I'm fairly certain i got a fee for buying it and then another fee for transferring it to my wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:34:47
It “won’t” drop? I thought it may drop a few 100 before rising.

Nice Thrustmaster t500 wheel ��
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:32:46
Yeah exactly that.  I usually transfer a bit of money in to a separate bank account each month with the vision of saving it, then in reality I end up dipping in to it and not being able to keep it.
Instead I've started putting money in to BTC, that way it's more hassle for me to withdraw it, and even if it falls at least I'll still have something to show.  Rather than impulse buying shit I don't necessarily need from Amazon!

Ahh I’m from the UK so we don’t celebrate that. It’s usually the middle of December, all round my parents house in PJs watching this 10/10 movie!
Well, waiting to buy this weekend, as of now I could probably afford a paddle pool with my btc haha

I have a vision of you waking up one morning with a hole in your ceiling... 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:42:08
I’m holding out to get a bit of money end of the month. I’m gonna monitor it then. If it goes to ~6800 I’ll 100% go in. But if it doesn’t I’ll wait it out. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:57:20
So thanks for the information, I'm going with it this way.
Just one question - when I transfer my € to GDAX will I be buying on the EUR market or am I able to convert to my own GBP currency?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:29:44
Push windows key. Type ‘snip’. Push enter. 
Easy. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:53:49
Yeah that's correct then.
So i was charged by Coinbase to purchase.  Then to move it from Coinbase to my preferred iOS wallet i was also charged.
Almost back in the green with that one too, i suspect by the time i wake it up it will be :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:49:02
With BTC being ~7200, is now a silly time to buy? 
This is the difficulty I’m working with, do I buy now or will it drop over the next few days to high 6000s... ugh. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 20:39:59
Pretty much the same as you. I used to check it every day now I’m not even bothered. I’m not spending any of it for 5 years anyways. Hopefully by then it’s stronger.
