Yep, Caesar cipher using the base58 charset shifted 14 places. This was just a little experiment, I've got some much more interesting ones coming soon :)

As far as I understand, this is the first time the developers have split and a hard fork has been proposed.

If it needs a leader, the philosophy behind the entire project has failed, it *cannot need* a leader at any time, so signing it = it failed. He's talking about consensus among developers. There are numerous extremely powerful parties who REALLY want to kill bitcoin and will do whatever it takes, so he wanted it to have a consensus of developers rather it being run by 2 people (easy to control/manipulate). He even says in the email that he's worried about what will happen to the underlying consensus model (in the software) if the consensus among developers becomes basically 1 guy.

And... it's gone. Congrats to whoever worked it out.

Signing it would be just as much the end of bitcoin as forking it (failure of developers to form a consensus).

He's concerned about the loss of consensus, *not* the increase in block size. When you understand that, you can see that he *can't* sign it because that would mean the consensus has failed (which is just as bad as a fork that drops the consensus model, which is what this is *really* about).

Couldn't it just be a pump and dump?
