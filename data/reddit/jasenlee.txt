I'm still proudest for being banned from for saying almost something identical to what you just wrote out. Both the fanboys and Apple get so butthurt if you criticize them in any way. I'm seriously thinking of getting rid of my iPhone. I've been on that mobile platform since they first launched it because it was the best at the time but now it just feels like some shit show UI mess when I compare it to what I see my friends walking around with. I probably won't until this one dies because I don't want to shell out the cash but yeah... everything you said.

Serious question... were you banned from for making that post there? 
I ask because they are notorious for banning anyone who makes the slightest criticism of the company.
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:22:36
Yeah... I've played for a couple of days and I won a ton then lost a ton and then won a ton. I don't know if I like that up and down spiral because it makes my palms sweat but I like playing the games. Truth be told I should probably be doing other things like laundry or something.

It's not that serious... no holy fucks are needed. Anyone who was serious hasn't been trading at Gox for at least 3 months. The price will stabilize (*meaning the overall market*) and Gox will fade away as many have been wishing for anyway. 
It's not a big deal people.

I've said this a million times. Mark Cuban is no sage and I don't know why anyone pays much attention to anything he says. He was standing at an interesting juncture at a rare moment in time and happened to make a shit load of money out it.

Just tried SatoshiDice and got some message about how my IP was from the US so I couldn't use the site.

Sorry... Somewhat of a novice. What do you mean by invest with the house?

Yeah... [China has stepped away from the BTC China]( clampdown and people can now trade with Yuan again. The fact that the price of BTC hasn't spiraled up or down is actually kind of encouraging IMO because it is a sign of its growing stability which will only bring in more adopters.

Sorry but what the hell is it? What is the purpose of it? Who runs it?

Since I've posted I've seen and heard so many similar stories. It doesn't seem like a reputable company to work with.

Holy fuck... 200 BTC? I'm sorry man.

Worse because they should know better. The same things MS was doing at that time almost killed all competition including Apple. So much so that Microsoft had to buy part of Apple to prop it up just so there would be some sort of laughable ruse of competition in the market.

Because I'm learning and I was told by many people here (this sub) that I should start with them. Would you suggest someone else? I'm open to any suggestions because like I said I'm learning. I also read a lot over at @_date: 2014-01-14 00:40:28

This is exactly why I can't get my family to buy Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 03:29:17
Someone already mentioned it below and it's not the one I referenced in a comment reply. ;)
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:26:10
Two questions...
1. Are you still selling them? The site seems to indicate that there are no more sales after Jan 30th. 
2. How do you buy with Bitcoin? The default option seems to be PayPal.

The guy got lucky and people hold him up as some kind of example of entrepreneurial genius. That's the only story here.

I'm already getting downvoted and I am asking an honest question so I really don't want to say unless a lot of people want to know. I'm seriously not some casino shill. I hesitated even making this post. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:00:40
That it's not just for speculation and people want to use it to actually buy things. That's why there is such an ardent push by supporters to get local, national and online retailers to use it. If its nothing more than a vehicle for speculation than it may eventually fail. People actually want to use it buy things.

IDK but they don't work in the United States.

I'm not trying to be a smart ass here but if they have that many problems that it would be filled to the brim with support questions maybe they need to re-think how they service their customers.
I can go to 100 other subreddits that are tech related and they aren't filled with support questions.
@_date: 2016-05-26 08:14:21
This seems like a planted question especially since the top comment seems to come from someone who works there as they keep saying "we".
@_date: 2016-05-26 22:55:44


That is some MBA+ level advice there. If more companies realized this their profits would soar. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:03:25
That's what made me bring this up too. I'm not even talking about it and people are asking me. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:16:16


Your comment just made me think of another thing. Considering the Chinese New Year starts on January 31st do you think there is a chance for two quick dips as new buyers come in? I can see paper wallets being used as gifts then as well. 
We all know some of the recent China issues but I don't think they can keep the genie in the bottle.

Please consider translating this; especially a English flyer I can print and pass to local businesses I want to start accepting Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:48:43
Works just fine for me. I'm not dismissing your issues but I'm not having any issues. That said I would say "These companies do not deserve the business" seems unfair. Maybe it's just some glitch with your computer.
Every time I've contacted them I get near immediate responses. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:02:52
Who the hell are they to tell you how you can spend your money?
Fuck them.

So what's the best method for withdrawing from Mt Gox to USD? Send it to Coinbase and pull it from there?
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:50:05
Fair enough and I typed that out too fast and should have chosen my words better. I agree. I have contacted them once. I did receive a near immediate response. You are correct and I shouldn't have used the words "every time" but instead "when I did contact them...".
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:01:23
Agreed but I think it's going to facilitate a lot of discussion around family tables. Not just the *"hey what's that paper wallet thing you gave John"* but people talking about Bitcoin in general.
People can read all the WSJ and Guardian articles they want but when a friend or family member is telling them about it they will listen twice as much. 
Also, if they do cash them out at least it makes them go through the process and if they tell others about their Bitcoin experience it is most likely to be along the lines of *"yeah, it really wasn't that hard"*. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:06:48
I think it's today. 
I could be wrong but I think the confusion is the OP posted with a title a few hours ago that indicated tomorrow when Blockchain sent out their tweet last night. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:13:40
I haven't seen these before. Why were they banned? Who banned them?

@_date: 2013-12-24 13:52:17
That announcement was made at 7:04 PM on Dec-23 so I'm assuming they actually mean today. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:19:38
I keep thinking along the same lines. I want to walk up and down the street in my neighborhood and handout envelopes with a quick summary of Bitcoin to all of the merchants which easily explains it. I did find [this]( so I'm thinking about making a special project out of turning it into a handout.
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:06:39


I'm in it for the long-run rather than short-term speculation so if that does happen you can be sure as hell I'll be obtaining as many more coins as I can afford.
