We would happily help you to sell your bitcoins.

Sellers are paid current MtGox rates.

You could buy your Bitcoins at  
Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.
Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.
Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.
Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.

Bitcoin-Brokers uses a weighted average for the previous 24 hour period as a baseline. From that point the purchasers buy Bitcoins at a rate of 2% below the weighted average. The sellers of Bitcoins are matched up with trade balancing, and are paid 8% below the weighted average price from the previous 24 hour period.
For example, if Bitcoin traded evenly between $80-$90 for the previous 24 Hour period, the baseline price would be set at $85.
All of the Buyers pay $83.30/Bitcoin for the day. All the sellers receive $78.20/Bitcoin for the day.
This takes the worrying out of having to try to "time" a good entry point. Every single buyer and seller are matched up and settled using a fair price. The settlement prices are listed on the website everyday so the prices are public record and this reassures the buyers and sellers that a true 6% spread was respected with every transaction. The published settlement prices adds a layer of transparency for both the buyer and the seller.

 just launched a new service which allows you to sell your coins through the website and receive cash deposited into any major Canadian bank account (CIBC, Royal Bank, Scotiabank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal).
This is a free service for you as a seller. You will be paid current MtGox rates without incurring a cent in fees.
Listing it on this site will open up all of Canada to you as compared to just trying to find a buyer in Toronto specifically.
Test it out with a small amount and see how long it takes to find a buyer. Once the first bit has been sold, just load some more. It's a free service for you, and eliminates the hassle and risk of meeting a stranger off of the internet.
There is a thread on the Bitcointalk.org forum discussing the service at this link:

Bitcoin-Brokers is offering the Bitcoin community the ability to sell their bitcoins at current MtGox rates and receive cash deposits into their own personal bank accounts.
Starting immediately if you bank at any of the following banks, you can sell your bitcoins for 0% fees and receive 100% of the proceeds from the sale of your bitcoins as a cash deposit into your personal bank account.
- Bank of America
- Capital One
- Citigroup
- JPMorgan Chase
- PNC Financial
- SunTrust
- TD Bank
- US Bancorp
- Wells Fargo
This exciting new service will allow sellers of bitcoins to list their bitcoins for sale on our website and have the buyers make cash deposits into their personal bank account. 
Prior to the buyer receiving the bitcoins, the seller will:
- be able to verify via online banking that there has been a cash deposit made into their account for the correct amount.
- receive a scanned copy of the actual deposit slip used during the deposit transaction.
- receive a scanned copy of the business card of the bank employee who accepted the deposit who can be contacted to verify the deposit.
This new service is initially only offered to residents in the USA, though other countries will be rolled out soon.
There are no maximum sized orders, and sellers can test the service with orders as small as $10.

There is no need to create a whole new bank. There isn't even a need to use an exchange. All that is needed is the exchange of value for bitcoins. This is evidenced with websites like 
There are a couple of interesting threads beginning to pop up on a new service which allows bitcoin sellers to be matched up with the buyers without the need for an exchange. Buyers pay the sellers directly through the sellers bank account.
@_date: 2013-06-19 16:45:39
I will try to explain.
For starters, you would never choose to simultaneously buy or sell on the site. You are either a buyer of bitcoins, or you are a seller of bitcoins.
Prior to a purchaser being able to buy bitcoins, the bitcoins need to be available on the website. Bitcoins are made available on the website when a seller chooses to list the bitcoin for sale.
As far as your question about why have more than one bank; when sellers list their bitcoins on our website, they also choose which particular bank that they hold their personal account at. Buyers are directed to go to that bank. The more banks that are offered, the more convenient the service becomes to purchasers. 
Since you are in the UK, and our website will eventually offer the service in the UK as well, let me explain using local examples.
If you were living in London and wanted to buy bitcoins from our site, it would be much more convenient for you to be able to buy them from Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland as compared to just being able to purchase from a single bank.
The service only allows cash deposits. Online banking is not permitted for deposits...only cash.
With respect to getting assurances from banks, and obtaining money transmitter licences...I think you are not quite understanding our business model. For starters, there is not a single bank account that we as a company use. We do not need to get permission from any banks because we do not use them. We simply help arrange the private buying and selling of bitcoins and each individual is receiving payments into their personal accounts. 
Bitcoin is completely decentralized, and so is Bitcoin-Brokers. As compared to exchanges which are constantly battling with regulatory issues because they send and receive payments into bank accounts; we never have people pay us directly. All payments are made into sellers accounts. 
With respect to your question about "does the seller decide when to sell?". When the seller lists the bitcoins for sale with us, they immediately become available for sale. We do not want to have sellers send us their bitcoins to hold. We want sellers to send us their bitcoins to sell and get paid cash into their bank accounts.
@_date: 2013-08-14 12:59:30
This is a dedicated Bitcoin-Brokers thread at Bitcointalk.org: 
If you ever find yourself in a position where you wanted to withdraw money from MtGox to a major US bank, you could withdraw your money from MtGox as bitcoin, then escrow it with Bitcoin-Brokers who will arrange a private sale the same day. 
This eliminates the need to pay a wire transfer fee. It eliminates the waiting time for a wire transfer to process and arrive; additionally sellers are getting prices above MtGox for their bitcoin.

If you have money stuck on MtGox and want funds directed to your US bank account, here is your solution:
Read this 7200 view thread:
The problem with MtGox is the wire transfers, and not the BTC withdrawals, so first things first, cancel your wire transfer, and withdraw your money in the form of BTC.
Once you have your BTC, you escrow the BTC with Bitcoin-Brokers (listed in that link). 
Bitcoin-Brokers then sends a buyer to your bank and the buyer makes a cash deposit into your bank account for your BTC.
This saves you the time waiting for a wire transfer. This saves you the cost of the wire transfer. Sellers are getting paid above MtGox for their BTC.
Go read the thread and you will see nothing but positive reviews about the new service.

I think the exact opposite thing would occur. 
If a major poker site like PokerStars started to accept BTC for deposits, this would have a positive effect on the value of BTC.
Think about the positive effect that the SR has on the value of bitcoin. 
I cant say for sure what each website processes in payments each day, but I would be willing to bet that PokerStars, UltimateBet etc do much more business than the SR ever has or will.

@_date: 2013-06-20 17:49:59
Great question, and perhaps the wording on the site needs to be adjusted to reflect a more accurate approach to the process.
Once the deposit has been made, the buyer collects the stamped cash receipt from the bank, as well as the business card of the teller who accepted the deposit. At this point, obtaining these two items are as much for the buyer's protection as it is proof of deposit.
These items are forwarded to us first via a quick file upload within our internal helpdesk. We then forward this same scanned slip to the seller via our helpdesk.
The forwarding of this info to the seller is more of a secondary means of proving the deposit has been made. Sellers will likely have online banking. Online banking will typically display the deposit as well as if that deposit was made in cash or check. 
If for whatever reason the client does not have online banking, or his/her online banking does not display the nature of the instrument used for deposit, she has the name of the teller, and other info to work with to confirm the deposit.
@_date: 2013-06-18 18:52:04
Another option is to list the bitcoins at  for free and have a buyer deposit cash into your bank account for the bitcoins. This gets you top price for the bitcoins, there are zero fees for the seller and the buyer pays a 2% fee.

Starting on Monday Sept 30, a new bitcoin service will commence.
The service will be called BitRemit, and it will be brought to the bitcoin community through Bitcoin-Brokers.
The service will allow bitcoin holders the ability to immediately liquidate their bitcoin holdings, and have any amount converted into a cash deposit into their bank account the same day.
This service has been designed initially to assist the bitcoin community in withdrawing their capital from any of the bitcoin exchanges such as MtGox, BitStamp, or BTC-e.
Instead of having to wait for a wire transfer from any of these exchanges, people can simply transfer the bitcoin to Bitcoin-Brokers, and a representative of Bitcoin-Brokers will physically walk down to any bank of your choice and make a cash deposit into your bank account to give you immediate access to cash for your bitcoin.
Initially this service will only offer deposits to be made into banks within the USA.
Even though this service was initially created to assist people in withdrawing capital from exchanges, the service can be used by anybody who wishes to sell their bitcoin for an immediate cash deposit into a USA bank account.
This holds the potential to service an additional market, and that is the remittance market.
For example, a British resident, or Indian resident, or resident from any country in the world could use this service as a way of sending a payment to anybody, or any company with a bank account in the USA.
We will accept any amount ranging from $500-$8,500.
How we do it: Bitcoin-Brokers and/or its representatives hold accounts at Bitstamp, BTC-e and other exchanges and can sell off the bitcoin at those market rates. Once the bitcoin has been sold off at one of those markets, we deduct a 7% service charge for walking down to your bank and depositing cash the same day.
For more information about the service, or to begin a BitRemit payment into a bank account, please contact Dan by submitting a ticket through our helpdesk by following this link:

Here is an interesting thread about something sort of like what we are discussing here. It allows for a direct payment from buyer directly into the seller's bank account and cutting out a bit of the middle man scenario which does not need to exist.
It is sort of its own decentralized exchange for buyers and sellers because the system removes itself from holding the cash, and in the process makes it impossible to ever encounter banking hurdles.
@_date: 2013-06-18 17:04:16
This is exactly why a service like the one announced today at  should be embraced. It allows bitcoin sellers to circumvent the exchanges and have the buyer pay the seller directly into their bank account. This completely eliminates the entire cost for the seller and grants them access to the funds immediately as compared to waiting for wire transfer or ACH or EFT or anything else along those lines.

It depends. I have seen transfers receive their first confirmation within 1 minute after BTC have been sent. Other times, it can take north of an hour.
On average though, I would say a transfer usually takes 20 minutes after funds have been sent before the receiver sees the first confirmation.

The value isn't the rate you are netting because frankly who could get excited about Bitstamp -7%?
The value in the offering is the ability to immediately convert bitcoin into an actual cash deposit made into your account.
For example, somebody who held an account at MtGox, but perhaps not at one of the other exchanges who needed a US wire transfer would no longer feel that their money was held captive at MtGox.
Each transaction actually requires a human to physically walk into a location with cash in hand to deposit into a bank account.

This thread discusses a new method of having your bitcoins converted to a cash deposit into any US bank. It is a free service.
Additionally, that same service is also discussed at Bitcointalk at this link:
The article wants to point out that people are having a hard time converting bitcoins to cash but here is a method which achieves this exact same process and it is coming at no cost to the seller of bitcoins. Full MtGox rates are paid for their bitcoins and deposited directly into their own bank accounts without needing to go through an exchange like MtGox.
This is a cheaper solution than MtGox (free). 
@_date: 2013-06-21 19:18:39
1)The website address is 
2)The claim that a bank payment can be reversed at Bitcoin-Brokers is false. I have explained this to you on the other thread, but I can see that the business concept still eludes you so allow me to explain here.
The service launched June 18th offering people the ability to list their bitcoins for sale on the site for free. When a seller lists their bitcoins on the site, they also provide us with their personal banking information.
When an interested purchaser sees bitcoins which are listed on our site, they can see which bank they need to make a payment at to purchase the bitcoins.
We provide instructions to the purchaser of bitcoins to deposit the purchase amount directly into the account of the bitcoin owner.
These are cash deposits. These are cleared funds, which have arrived in the seller’s bank account.
Setting the business up in this fashion allows bitcoin sellers to sell their bitcoins for free, and receive cash deposits into their bank account based on current MtGox rates. This saves the seller the costs normally associated with selling bitcoins such as MtGox fees, wire transfer fees, currency exchange. Eventually when the website gains enough attention it will also become the fastest way for sellers to gain access to cleared cash from sold bitcoins.
The benefit from the buyer’s standpoint is that they can begin to buy bitcoins at major banks, and the net fee to the buyer is only 2%.
Another benefit is the small amount of time needed for the entire transaction to occur within. As compared to wire transfers which can take days to arrive, our very first bitcoins that were loaded on our site resulted in cash in the seller’s bank account within hours. We have a ton of buyers waiting right now, the thing that we really need is for the sellers to hopefully test the website out. With that being said the smallest order size is $10. I had set it at that level to try to make the perceived risk to either a buyer or seller as low as possible.
@_date: 2013-06-20 19:54:21
There are a couple of interesting threads which are beginning to brew discussing an alternative method of having your bitcoins converted into cash deposits into US bank accounts in much smaller timeframes that what MtGox offers.
For anybody who might be interested in converting their bitcoins to cash in their accounts with zero fees you might find these interesting.

I am tired of people making these sorts of comments about MtGox prices not being realistic, and that Bitstamp offers more realistic prices.
Time for a reality check people...MtGox is a realistic price, that's why all those people are willing to pay it.
The only people who say that MtGox pricing isn't correct are the people who are getting ready to buy.
The people who already own their bitcoin like I do, are quite happy seeing the price on MtGox being exactly what it is.
The value of bitcoin is whatever people are willing to pay for it. In this case, half the people are willing to pay MtGox.

An easy way for you to get your funds off of MtGox and into your US bank account can be seen by reading this 7000 view thread:
Basically you withdraw your money from MtGox in the form of BTC instead of waiting for a wire transfer. The BTC withdrawals do not have delays...just the wire transfer withdrawals are delayed.
Once you have your BTC, you escrow it with Bitcoin-Brokers who will direct buyers to make immediate cash deposits into your bank account.
This saves you the wire transfer costs. It saves you the time of waiting for MtGox. Additionally, people are getting above MtGox prices for their BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-21 17:46:24
This is NOT a money transfer. This is a human being walking into a physical bank and handing the teller physical cash which is deposited DIRECTLY into the seller's account.
Prior to the depositor leaving the bank the entire transaction has been completed and cleared funds are in the seller's account.

Allow me to explain. The $10 that you see on the site is the minimum amount of bitcoins that can be purchased in USD. Using the dropdown menu, the amount that you wish to order needs to be ordered in $10 increments.

A market maker's job is NOT to make the market price stable. A market maker's real responsibility is to create a market in a particular security or commodity. They actively agree to act as a go-to place where people can transact in that market in which they are making.
An example market maker for an OTC stock is a brokerage house, or houses that have an agreement with the security issuer to actively buy and sell shares in that stock, and in the process, they create the market.
It has nothing to do with stabilizing prices.

You seem to be interested in creating a disturbance between two parties for a reason which eludes me.
You are making claims that I have been deleting your posts which I have not. I cannot delete your posts any more than you can delete mine. Perhaps a moderator deleted a post of yours. Perhaps I had deleted an older post of mine which pruned yours off. Rest assured, you have not been censored. 
Starting threads like this one, in an attempt to drag two parties into an arena for a purpose which is yet to be determined is wrong on so many levels.
I can't believe I feel compelled to even write this post, but the last thing I want to do is have your comments be taken as anything other than drivel by the other party.
For that reason, if the owner of that website happens to read this post, please ignore the OP. I have never said anything negative about you or about your website's service. I think your website is a fantastic addition to the bitcoin community. I have recommended it to countless people including a lovely couple that I met at breakfast this morning. I will continue to recommend it as well. 
In my opinion Bitcoin has enormous potential. We are just starting to see the earliest signs of adoption. With that being said, I think that there is room for multiple businesses such as Localbitcoins and Bitcoin-Brokers to simultaneously serve the same market. Each business offering a little something else that the other one didn't and in the process they offer a wider selection to the bitcoin community as a whole which is a good thing.

Bitcoin-Brokers creates an immediate bridge between bitcoins being bought at BitStamp or BTC-e and bridging them so that they can IMMEDIATELY be sold based on MtGox rates. This is usually a 4-6% opportunity. If you tried to do this on your own, it will take you days to move money around. Bitcoin-Brokers collapses the timeframe and settles the sale price at the exact same time you buy. Its a booking of an immediate and guaranteed profit.

 just launched a new service which allows you to sell your coins through the website and receive cash deposited into any major Canadian bank account (CIBC, Royal Bank, Scotiabank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal).
This is a free service for you as a seller. You will be paid current MtGox rates without incurring a cent in fees.

I run  and right now there is a small amount of bitcoins available at Bank of America for purchase.
The service launched yesterday offering people the ability to list their bitcoins on the site for free. When a seller lists their bitcoins on the site, they also provide us with their personal banking information.
When an interested purchaser sees bitcoins which are listed on our site, they can see which bank they can make a payment at to purchase the bitcoins.
We provide instructions to the purchaser of bitcoins to deposit the purchase amount directly into the account of the owner of the bitcoins.
Setting the business up in this fashion allows bitcoin sellers to sell their bitcoins for free, and receive cash deposits into their bank account based on current MtGox rates. This saves the seller the costs normally associated with selling bitcoins such as MtGox fees, wire transfer fees, currency exchange. Eventually when the website gains enough attention it will also become the fastest way for sellers to gain access to cleared cash from sold bitcoins.
Once again, this is totally free for sellers. The buyers incur a 2% service fee.

It is specific in the sense that when you perform a search inside the subreddit for the term "UK". There seemed to be a disproportionate amount of people emoting their concerns for how challenging it was to locate any bitcoins inside the UK.
Believe me, adding a separate settlement price for the UK is not something I wanted to do, yet I was willing to do so if market conditions inside the UK seemed to indicate that it might be necessary.
Creating this thread was an attempt to hear a whisper of UK's voice on the opinion...that's all.

If you want to use technical tools, you need to incorporate more than one signal such as the MACD.
When I trade, I use the MACD, the MACD Histogram and also the Williams %. 
The MACD is used to measure the momentum, the histogram to measure the distance between your signal crossover line and current prices.
The Williams as a measure of short term overbought and oversold conditions.
If you ware going to use the MACD, I suggest you avoid short term charts like the 5 and 15 minute charts.
I would stick to using a few different time frames, and the longer the better. I use the Week charts, the 6 hour charts, and the 1 hour charts in conjunction with the three signals.
Seems to work well for me.

Currently on the site US and Canada are both settling trades at current MtGox rates with buyers paying a 2% fee.
For example: The current MtGox price is $100/BTC and the buyer wants to purchase the 1 BTC listed for sale on the website. The buyer walks into the seller's bank account with $100 in hand and makes the deposit. The seller receives the $100 cash deposit into his/her bank account, the buyer is forwarded .98 of a BTC and Bitcoin-Brokers keeps the 2%.
The UK section of the website will take a 2% commission paid by the buyer as well, but the price which the trade settles at doesn't have to be exactly current MtGox.
We could offer the sellers current MtGox +2%, 3% etc.
I just wanted to allow bitcoiners in the UK a chance to possibly educate me on what should be offered to them.

Bitcoin-Brokers is offering the Bitcoin community the ability to sell their bitcoins at current MtGox rates and receive cash deposits into their own personal bank accounts.
Starting immediately if you bank at any of the following banks, you can sell your bitcoins for 0% fees and receive 100% of the proceeds from the sale of your bitcoins as a cash deposit into your personal bank account.
- Bank of America
- Capital One
- Citigroup
- JPMorgan Chase
- PNC Financial
- SunTrust
- TD Bank
- US Bancorp
- Wells Fargo
This exciting new service will allow sellers of bitcoins to list their bitcoins for sale on our website and have the buyers make cash deposits into their personal bank account. 
Prior to the buyer receiving the bitcoins, the seller will:
- be able to verify via online banking that there has been a cash deposit made into their account for the correct amount.
- receive a scanned copy of the actual deposit slip used during the deposit transaction.
- receive a scanned copy of the business card of the bank employee who accepted the deposit who can be contacted to verify the deposit.
This new service is initially only offered to residents in the USA, though other countries will be rolled out soon.
There are no maximum sized orders, and sellers can test the service with orders as small as $10.
@_date: 2013-06-20 18:05:52
At this point both parties would be advised that the deposit is under investigation due to an obvious conflict. 
Under the above listed scenario that you have painted, this is how it would be handled:
Since the buyer has presented a deposit slip which appears to be legitimate, it would then be the seller's responsibility to provide us with a screenshot of the bank account clearly displaying the credentials of the account ownership. (blacking out any info if need be which might be deemed unrelated)
If we cannot see any evidence from the screenshot that a deposit has ben received, the buyer will be advised of this information and will need to return to the bank where the deposit was made to speak with the bank teller or bank manager to gather supporting documentation that the deposit was made. 
If the buyer had forged the deposit slip, this is where they will admit defeat, because they know attempting to walk into a bank and hand the bank a forged deposit slip for a deposit which never existed will land them in jail. Bitcoins are still safe in our account.
Now if the buyer is able to produce additional documentation from the bank indicating that the seller of the bitcoins did in fact receive a deposit into their account we will advise the seller of this information and provide them with a reasonable amount of time to disprove the buyer's claim which corresponds with the seller's bank. If the seller fails to do so, we will take the side of the buyer who is holding the stamped slip along with the side of the seller's bank who has provided us with evidence indicating the seller had intentionally attempted to defraud the buyer.
In this case, the buyer would have the bitcoins forwarded to their account and the seller would be banned from using the service.

Here is the direct quote from the link you just placed;
Definitions of User, Exchanger, and Administrator 
            This guidance refers to the participants in generic virtual currency arrangements, using the terms "user," "exchanger," and "administrator."6 A user is a person that obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services.7 An exchanger is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency. An administrator is a person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) a virtual currency, and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) such virtual currency. 
So once again....the person who is getting paid for their personal holdings of bitcoin is NOT considered an exchanger, is NOT required to obtain a money transmitter license, and CAN receive a personal cash payment from somebody who is simply buying the seller's bitcoins.
It is that simple, it just happens to be yourself who is trying to make it appear otherwise.

 launched a new service today which allows sellers of bitcoins to list their bitcoins for sale, and when a purchaser buys the bitcoins, they are directed to deposit cash into the seller's bank account. This service means that sellers of bitcoins can convert the bitcoins into cash without incurring any fees. This service carries a 2% fee for the buyer. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 16:33:56
 launched a new service a couple of days ago for the bitcoin community.
This new service allows sellers of bitcoins to list their bitcoins for sale on our website for free. We find the buyers of the bitcoins for the sellers, and instruct the buyers to deposit cash into the seller's personal bank accounts.
We had our first round of bitcoins loaded onto the site a couple days ago, and within a couple of hours, the bitcoins were purchased and the seller received a cash deposit for the bitcoins deposited into his bank account.
The seller received full current MtGox rates, and did not incur a single cent in fees. Cash was deposited into the seller's account and the buyer of the bitcoins is just as happy with the service as the seller.
There was another round of bitcoins loaded onto the site for purchase just a couple of hours ago, which can be paid for in cash at any Bank of America. (It is less than the mount that the OP requested, but this info might be valuable to others.)
Total cost to seller (free) Total cost to buyer (2%)
I started a thread at Bitcointalk.org here: 
The buyer has shared his experience, and the seller will do so as well soon.
With that being said, if you own bitcoins and want them sold without incurring any fees, you can load them for onto our site for free. We will find a buyer for you who will deposit cash into your personal bank account.

The buyer collects a cash receipt from the bank to show proof of deposit. This is forwarded to us after the deposit is made, so that in case the seller gets hit by a bus and dies, we still have the ability to release the funds to the buyer and complete the transaction. The seller is given one business day to confirm. Our first transaction was literally flawless from both the buyer's standpoint as well as the seller's. Both came away from the transaction extremely pleased with how easy it was, and both have intentions of using the service again in the future.
@_date: 2013-06-20 16:50:37
For starters I don't think that either party would logically think they could "get away" with anything.
From the sellers standpoint, they can't simply hold back the bitcoins because they need to be transferred to us before they go up for sale.
Now with that being said, a buyer needs to produce a stamped copy of a deposit slip as well as the business card of the teller who accepted the cash deposit before bitcoins are transferred.
So to address your question specifically, if a seller of bitcoins claimed that they didn't receive a payment from the buyer, they will need to explain to us why the buyer is holding a stamped deposit slip with the sellers personal banking information on it.
Both parties are completely protected.

You are going to lose all your money if you attempt to move forward with this business model.
The only people in the world who would pay 20% above MtGox are either stupid, or are scammers.
There are not many stupid people in the BTC world, so I would say you are more likely to attract a plethora of scammers who will pay you with a credit card, collect your BTC, perform a chargeback and you will be left asking yourself "why didn't I listen to that voice of reason on Reditt".
It's great you want to get into the BTC world, but it is clear you have not given your idea much consideration.
Go back to the drawing board and come up with a better mousetrap, because this one will not work.

Its not dropping...its called basing which is normal for anything which has run this hard for this long. Read up on  technical trading because that's how this thing trades. You should study up on MACD, MACD Histogram, RSI etc...it all comes into play when trading BTC.
It just kicked off the 30 on the RSI which probably doesn't mean anything to you...but to traders..it is everything. These are the technical moments that technical traders wait for.
There are no guarantees obviously...I am not saying I can read the future, yet technically, it looks ready for a pop up from these $90 levels very soon. (For the record when I say soon...I don't mean it has to happen right this minute...it might take hours, maybe even days...but I bet we pop from here near term).

For starters, what I am doing is NOT against FinCen regs whatsoever. The way that this business is set up, this is no different than a transaction on Localbitcoins.com 
There is a private person paying another private person for bitcoins...this is not against FinCen.
Yes I want MtGox to set the rates. As a seller you would be paid the current rates that MTGox offers when a buyer decides to buy. If you happen to see the value of Bitcoins plunging on MtGox, you can easily have your bitcoins removed from our site, and relist them once prices move back up. You would not incur the .60 transaction fee that MtGox charges, and you do not incur any fees to have your bitcoins sold and have cash deposited into your account. No wire transfer costs. I think it is a great service, and you are welcome to come test it out.

This exciting new service will allow sellers of bitcoins to list their bitcoins for sale on our website and have the buyers make cash deposits into their personal bank account. 
Prior to the buyer receiving the bitcoins, the seller will:

- receive a scanned copy of the actual deposit slip used during the deposit transaction.
- receive a scanned copy of the business card of the bank employee who accepted the deposit who can be contacted to verify the deposit.
This new service is initially only offered to residents in the USA, though other countries will be rolled out soon.
There are no maximum sized orders, and sellers can test the service with orders as small as $10.
