Typically this would lead one to think a market has come to the end of its bull run, but Bitcoin will eat those shitty hamburgers and stomp over Jack in The Box.  That place exists still?

USDT is worth less than a dollar at the moment so BTC is worth more USDT compared to USD. If that makes sense

CB Pro does not require a minimum deposit where did you read this? I literally just deposited $100.
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:38:07
My fee was low and I wasn’t really looking at the mempool at all before sending so now I get to wait, heh.
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:13:35
Coinbase Pro used to have completely free limit orders. I used to deposit money and buy BTC AND send it to my external wallet without a single fee. Now limit orders are 0.15%. So yes, it used to exist. I don’t know if there is any other exchange that offered that at any point besides CB Pro.
@_date: 2019-07-25 22:52:36
Get rid of the XRP and LTC for XMR and you’ll do fine. I like to keep my BTC at 85% or more though.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:55:28
I’m willing to bet the fees are calculated on your entire position. Say you wanna go long 3x and put up $100. Lets say you do a limit order so the fee will be 0.16%. That 0.16% will be charged from your entire position size of $300 and not the $100 that you are using with leverage. Does that make sense? That is how Bitmex calculates fees on Margin, I bet Kraken follows the same rule.

Gotcha, I have never used CashApp but I was going to try it. The thing I like about the cash app is the ability to instantly buy and withdraw. The “fees” or whatever it is they do that gets them their cut, are lower than the coinbase app’s fees. Thats a big plus for me. As much as I prefer to use Coinbase Pro, the deposit wait can be a bit of a pain when you miss out on opportune dips.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:44:42

Man same here. It happened so quick I feel.
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:41:36
A way to check is by going into ‘My Wallets’ in CB Pro and select deposits. It will show you all of your deposits and your most recent one should be the 1k. It provides you with the date Coinbase will payout the USD when your bank actually sends CB the money. I’ve noticed that my payout is typically 24 hours sooner than what they have listed.
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:20:14
The faster you want this to happen the more fees you will probably pay. If you attach your debit card to Coinbase I believe you get it right away and can transfer it but its like 4% in fees. Bank purchase on Coinbase locks in the price you buy it at but you can’t move your coins for about a week. Coinbase Pro transfer you are using now takes a week but the fees are ten times lower and you are susceptible to the price movement. If you are buying every week or two weeks or whatever the Coinbase Pro deposit way will probably be the best way for you and will avoid a hefty amount of fees over time. If the prices drop and you don’t want to wait for your CB Pro deposit to hit then use one of the other two Coinbase methods to get the low price you desire but with added fees. I truly believe these are the best options for what you are trying to do.
Edit: As someone else mentioned, they also have the option to wire money same day but the fee is $10 flat I believe.
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:46:20
It should tell you what date you joined reddit on your profile
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:24:33
Fair point, however, they are still one of the top safest exchanges and its hard to find fees as low as theirs with free withdraws. Not to mention when I ever need to withdraw USD its always in my bank next day.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:55:01
Try upping your verification level. I assume you are only level 1.

@_date: 2019-07-11 16:14:49
You can deposit directly to coinbase pro. Takes 3-10 days, depends on your bank. Mine is 4 days consistently. Once the money hits you can buy and withdraw immediately.
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:55:37
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:15:27
You are probably only level 1 verified thats why the wait after bank purchase is so long. You can also setup a debit card and you can buy and withdraw immediately but fee is like 4%. You can deposit directly to coinbase pro but you need to provide your ID. Coinbase Pro you can withdraw immediately. I’ve heard the Cash App allows buys and withdraws immediately. I haven’t done it for myself yet but I’m going to try it out.
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:04:28
Your funds will be debited from your bank but may not show up in Coinbase Pro for a few more days. Typically I deposit on Monday, money is leaves my CU on Tuesday, deposit shows up in CB Pro by Friday. LOL at the people telling you to switch exchanges, keep using CB Pro. CB Pro has free withdrawals and they cover the mining cost. Their withdrawals show up in your bank within 24 hours if you are withdrawing USD. Coinbase is fast, its your bank that is slow to send the money. Just because its debited from your checking account doesn’t mean your bank immediately sent it to Coinbase Pro.
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:50:57
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:35:56
Just transfer from coinbase to coinbase pro and bam you hit withdraw and its withdrawn immediately, pending the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2019-07-13 02:18:04
On the bright side, BTC still holding that 65% dominance.
@_date: 2019-07-05 23:11:40
Not trying to shill anything as I don’t own anything but BTC but I believe Monero follows something similar to what you describe. It has a gradual mining reward decline, however I’m not sure if it happens in-time or like every hour, day, etc. If you graphed the BTC halving and XMR mining rewards, XMR would be curved and BTC would have the stair step look. I just thought that was interesting.
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:18:04
Because that’s irresponsible with any investment. You invest what you can afford like everything else. People who say that don’t understand much about anything.

@_date: 2019-07-05 11:11:20
Eh in my opinion it wont matter in the long run, It ran up to 13.8k last week but look where we are now. That delay can help as much as it can hurt.
@_date: 2019-07-13 12:35:28
Its not an instant deposit, it takes about a week. Withdraws are though
@_date: 2019-07-29 00:23:14
Cash App will work just fine for this if its available in your country. You can buy and send immediately.

Coinbase Pro is the exchange side of Coinbase. Fees are 10 times or more lower (0.15% and 0.25%, every $1000 buy is only $1.50 in fees on limit orders) and the withdraws are FREE and immediate.
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:11:46
Go back to Coinbase Pro. Trading fees are lower and free withdrawals.

@_date: 2019-07-13 12:12:02
You know if you just deposit money onto coinbase pro the fee is exponentially cheaper? Coinbase fees are 2-3% or something? Pros fees are 0.15% for maker and 0.25% for taker. Thats only $1.50 for $1000 purchase for limit orders.
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:18:50
Yet? Do they have plans to do so?

Coinbase deposit hits Friday morning ��
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:28:13
There is no waiting for dips lol. Rule  buy Bitcoin. Rule  If it dips, buy more. 
@_date: 2019-07-20 16:34:33
This is due to your bank then. My Coinbase bank purchases only take 5 days to move. I usually use Coinbase Pro though where they allow instant crypto withdraws but the deposit time can be anywhere from 3-10 business days depending on your bank. I use a credit union so they don’t typically take too long depositing my money to Coinbase Pro. Hopefully this helps a little.
Edit: Just wanted to clarify something here, just because the money has been removed from your specific bank account does not mean that your bank has actually sent the money to coinbase yet. Banks use our money to profit from, they don’t just keep it on hand 100% of the time.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:21:29
Only if you sell and if you make profit you owe taxes on that profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:17:04
So many overpriced alts lol. It’s laughable that Bitcoins Market dominance is slow low right now. Some coins created less than two months ago already having billion+ market caps. If anyone holding alts right had any idea about anything they would trade for bitcoin very soon if not now. 
@_date: 2019-07-13 02:00:28
If you have a coinbase account you already have a coinbase pro account except you may need to provide your ID if you haven’t already.

@_date: 2017-12-30 18:56:56
I don’t disagree with that but in terms of where the value truly lies at this point in the space I still feel that it’s in bitcoin. Seeing coins created less than two months ago garnering billions in marketcap seems “bubbly” to me. Unless I’m moving huge sums of money I would probably use alts for transferring but my trust lies with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:41:41
The simple fact that I can’t buy during dips is a huge annoyance for me on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:45:54

Day trading is fine, using the CME expiry date as your main reason to short isn’t. I entered long at 6825 due to the 6800 resistance turned support with a stop below. If we move above 7150 with volume then Ill move my stop up just below that and continue to wait until we enter 7300-7500 and I will exit somewhere within there and wait for the next clear signal.

Idk why people dislike Coinbase. I send USD to Coinbase Pro, set limit orders and can then send my BTC to a personal wallet without paying a single fee including Mining fees. No other exchange offers that. You should tell everyone that and maybe you wont feel the need to shower afterwards.

I no longer use banks as I switched to veridian credit union which has a big stamp in IA. I'd recommend them Personally as I've had no trouble depositing and withdrawing. Besides them, Wells Fargo is set up fairly easy from what my friend told me as he goes threw them. Hope that's of some help.

As far as I know, cause I just made a new account, Binance doesn’t require anything more than an email. But youre limited to 2 BTC worth of withdraws per day. You can provide more info like an ID to withdraw more if you want though. Its really easy and fees are cheap. Withdraws are like $3-5 bucks for BTC
@_date: 2018-10-09 12:57:05
If you have access to coinbase then you have access to coinbase pro. Coinbase Pro will let you sell using a limit order, this will cost you 0$ in fees. You can also withdraw to your bank for free.

Why would you want to transfer from coinbase (an exchange) to another exchange then your hardware wallet? 
Go to pro.coinbase.com, same login as your coinbase account. Deposit from your Coinbase account (instant and free) then you can withdraw from there for free to your hardware wallet and the fees are 10x cheaper than the Coinbase App for when you want to buy more later.
@_date: 2019-08-27 01:43:55
Cash App will probably be the quickest way to do this. It’s quite simple too.
@_date: 2019-08-14 21:57:43
Just because you can go 100x leverage doesn’t mean you have to. 2-3x is more than enough and your liquidation price is nearly 40% away. Introduce stop losses and use only a portion of your account. You should never let yourself come close to liquidation. Literally a stop loss 1% above your liq price you could have saved some BTC for the next YOLO PLAY DAWG.

Hey man thats pretty interesting. I actually didn’t know that about LIBRA. I looked up some more information and I’m not sure I like what I read.
“But Facebook/Calibra and other founding members of the Libra Association will earn interest on the money users cash in that is held in reserve to keep the value of Libra stable.”
I understand the purpose of why they are doing this but it just seems like more of the same of whats already in place, no? It has its advantages over the current system and I agree with what you said about BTC and LIBRA coexisting.
I’m just saying for OP I wouldn’t hodl LIBRA for the simple reason it’s meant to be a stable currency not a deflationary asset I use to increase wealth with over time.
Edit; Forgot to mention, yes this would be more helpful for countries dealing with hyperinflation and also need the added stable value. I can see the advantages it has at where we are currently. I do however believe BTC will become more stable overtime

Don’t let margin trading scare you. Liquidations happen mostly on people who are over leveraged like 25x-100x. Even 10x can be too risky. But, low leverage like 2-3x is perfectly manageable. Bitcoin would have to swing 60%+ before you would be at risk for any liquidation and you also have control over how much capital you want to risk to begin with.

@_date: 2019-06-27 19:54:36
Actually Coinbase pros fees are .015% for limit orders and Krakens are .016%. Coinbase has the lower fees if you use the exchange. Kraken doesn’t have a noob app like Coinbase does. Thats where the fees are high. Move stuff to Coinbase Pro. Same login with your Coinbase and lower fees than Kraken.
Edit: I’ve used Coinbase Pro formerly Gdax for over two years. I’ve never encountered an issue where I needed to call support, but I can’t say thats the same for everyone
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:04:50
If I’m not Mistaken Kraken is US based and allows you to short bitcoin with a max leverage of 5x. Fees are 0.16% for Maker fees and I think its 0.26% for Taker fees but I could be off a little on the Taker fee.

Oh no, its risky for the trader. Exchanges like Bitmex make a killing off people over leveraging.

If you deposit fiat onto Coinbase Pro you can withdraw your BTC immediately. Depositing fiat can take 3-5 business days but once its on there you can buy BTC and withdraw immediately. I typically have a steady flow onto the exchange so I don’t really have an issue with fiat taking a week to be deposited.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:18:22

I don’t think there is a catch. The catch with using the regular app is the catch due to the high ass fees. Coinbase Pro is its saving grace. It also has free withdraws to your external wallets. Idk if Kraken offers that either.

All you really need to do is add up your gains and losses and at the end of the year your total gain or loss is what you report. It helps to keep a record of your own trades but coinbase pro has excel sheets with your buys and sells you can download for each coin. It adds it all up for you.

Try coinbase pro. Its the more advanced exchange version of coinbase, yet still very easy to use. Unless that is what you are already using. It has the same login but the fees are much lower on coinbase pro than coinbase. Coinbase has 1.49-3% on buy and sells and coinbase pros are .15%-.25%.

Sounds like you need more verification. I deposit money into Coinbase Pro every week and buy btc without a fee and also send it to my external wallet for free. People saying coinbase sucks are morons who probably just use the app and pay the “stupid tax” fee. Coinbase pro has 0 fees on limit orders and withdraws to personal wallets and also when selling into USD to your bank. Absolutely no other exchange offers this. Its the best one hands down. It also insures your crypto and USD. Again, very little exchanges offer this. 
On a side note, bank deposits that take long are not Coinbase’s fault. If its taking long then that has to do with your actual bank taking forever to fund Coinbase the money.

Its literally the same as gold. If BTC drops by $100 after you buy $1000 worth. The person you bought from still has the $1,000. You just have BTC that is now $100 less in USD. This is the same with every market. 
Edit: This is assuming that 1 Bitcoin is also worth $1,000. If you are purchasing fractions of a Bitcoin and it drops $100. Then you take the amount of BTC you have and multiply it by the amount it dropped, in this case $100, and that will give you the amount of money you are theoretically down. 
Hopefully this make sense.

@_date: 2019-01-24 20:44:20
The USD is transferred to the person you buy the Bitcoin from. This would be the same with gold. If you buy gold with $1,000 the USD goes to the seller. You receive the gold. If gold goes down, that person still has $1,000 and you still have the same amount of gold, however, if gold goes down in price that means the market has decided it is worth less at that point in time. This is no different with BTC. BTC is just more volatile because its still not a very liquid market compared to gold.

You may not have had it set to ‘Post Only’ which sells your entire order. The other option will allow your order to be broken up into separate orders and some of those orders may have a taker fee on them. Check your purchase history for BTC USD and you may see that they were multiple orders with one or more charging a taker fee. Post Only on limit orders will prevent this.

You wont have to wait a week every time you buy thats just how long it will take to get you set up with them. After that you can buy instantly with a debit card. Only way you can buy RIGHT NOW is to check localbitcoins or find a friend who has it and buy it from them. Otherwise getting an exchange account set up will be worth it down the road when prices crash or rocket up again. Good luck then.
Edit: Coinbase is insured up to $250k in USD and your crypto is also insured but Im not sure the max limit. This is just as safe as PayPal if not safer.
Edit: Coinbase is not an unknown website even for a newb. Its made for newbs.

Of course it's worth, set up those auto payments on coinbase or if you'd rather not pay fees just deposit it to your usd Wallet on coinbase then buy using the usd Wallet with no fees. Totally worth it

Could happen within a couple weeks or less based off the recent trend we have seen. Some say we could even bounce around $4800-$5200 for the bottom but that’s a wait and see scenario.

Pretty much my thoughts exactly, buy bitcoin with credit, sell bitcoin for cash. From what I know the interest rate is smaller for purchases compared to cash advances.

This is like 3rd grade math stuff man. Did no one stop you from posting these silly questions?
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:22:42
Bitcoin is a traded commodity/asset/currency whatever you want to call it, doesn’t matter it’s traded therefore you gotta look at the charts. You wanna know why it dipped? We hit multiple points of resistance yesterday and breaking above would have put us into a nice trend reversal with 10k in sight. However we broke down from the resistance and now we could be headed back to 6k before we trend higher again. I do not pay attention to news when trading. The charts tell me everything I need to know. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 04:24:30
This sub is full of salty fucks. Not sure why, they should all be rich. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:25:43
You gotta look at it this way, you should be happy with both scenarios. Price goes up yay, my bitcoin is now worth more money. Price goes down yay, my money is worth more bitcoin, therefore you can get more for less. Once I realized I’m here for the long run I no longer care what the price is I’m just happy I have Bitcoin. May not help with the price watching but at least you may eventually not care what it is day by day. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 04:21:47
Too bad that price includes fees. Use coinbase pro for the accurate $6,666.66. Much more saisfying
@_date: 2018-07-14 02:58:09

Been in crypto over a year now, those are basically challenge accepted walls to break down, that is if they even keep it up when the price decides to break through. Lot of bitcoins that wall though. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 03:36:10
Only if I sell at the right time on the way down? Why would I sell when its going down? I would just buy more. Im not trading

His question was can he trust them. And all those exchanges ask for the same info, what is your point?
@_date: 2019-09-06 22:31:59
Most larger exchanges are keeping them in cold storage. Coinbase for example keeps ~98% in cold storage I believe.
@_date: 2018-07-10 04:31:20
The annoying part isnt that endless amounts of people post this. Its that they post it using coinbase which includes fees so its not even actually $6,666.66. Use Coinbase Pro for accurate $6,666.66 observations rookies.
@_date: 2018-07-17 11:00:42
Thanks man but Ive been trading crypto for awhile, very familiar with stop loss.  Im referring to the current prices and I no longer trade during these tightening patterns. I only accumulate until our next run.
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:08:59
Oh my god people will look for anything to justify price movements. Lmao no this literally had nothing to do with that. You think people heard this song and were able to set up accounts and put tons of money into bitcoin? Takes a good week or more to get most accounts set up and get money in there and actually purchase it. This was from people who already had money ready and waiting in their accounts to buy when we got past 6800. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 03:07:56
For real, I also advise you to learn to use coinbase pro. You can deposit money and set limit orders and purchase with NO FEES. 100% of my invested money goes to BTC etc. and nothing goes to paying those BS fees. 
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:26:02
BlockFi seems to be reputable. I’d start looking at them
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:38:31
Ive been considering the same thing. Im a big believer in Bitcoin and my car is nothing more than a money suck anyway. Might as well downgrade to something cheaper and use the rest on bitcoin. Would be cool to be one of the few people in the world to own a whole one when they do become worth a whole lot more.

Use coinbase pro then. Educate yourself and maybe you’ll have a better time
@_date: 2018-07-09 17:56:54
I noticed a few usdt markets, including binance showing bitcoin above 7k over the weekend even thought usdt was sitting around 99 cents. Seemed like a glitch. It was definitely not above 7k on binance over the weekend so it had to be some sort of CMC glitch.
@_date: 2018-07-14 14:32:14
Totally I get it, I actually switched to a credit union awhile before I even discovered crypto but I haven’t had a single problem with them or even coinbase. I did however have a problem with Visa charging my debit card double for a purchase I made a couple weeks prior when everyone was having double purchases show up. It charged my card for a double Litecoin purchase, however I didn’t actually receive any Litecoins, Visa just literally stole my money. It left my bank account and went somewhere. I got it back, but now I strictly use ACH deposits to Coinbase Pro and purchase using Limit orders so I no longer pay anymore fees. Good Luck!
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:44:16
Depends on your country, U.S. you would pay taxes on the USD value at the time of trade. You are taxed on the profit you make and I do not believe the leverage matters but I’m also not a tax expert.
@_date: 2019-09-07 01:19:45
Yea they send the coins immediately upon withdrawing from your account. It takes about the same time as it would from your own wallet.

No offense but theres a difference between a full node and a miner. Full nodes are the consensus of the network, miners provide the hash power. Someone correct me if I’m wrong please.
@_date: 2018-07-14 03:31:25
Why did you fee the need to tell me to shut the hell up? He wants to invest $10... minimum coinbase fee is $0.99. Or he could use coinbase pro which is no harder than just coinbase and all of that $10 could be used to purchase bitcoin instead of $9.01.  Are you too dumb to figure coinbase pro out? Its easy as fuck. Why you so mad?
@_date: 2018-07-14 03:49:57
Don’t get me wrong, you don’t need to store it on there. Im simply saying for getting the most bang for your buck in terms of actually purchasing it, GDAX, now CB Pro, is my recommendation. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 03:14:51
Do you realize you can purchase bitcoin on coinbase pro and not pay any fees? Why would you avoid it? 
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:36:42

Uh yea they service more people that most if not all other exchanges. They are top 3 most trusted exchanges.
@_date: 2018-07-14 03:38:38
If you make consistent purchases, the fees add up to what could be a decent amount of bitcoin or whatever crypto your fancy, which over time would be worth a good chunk of change if we believe the price will continue to increase. I dont even log into coinbase anymore, straight to CB Pro, deposit my money, wait a few days then set my limit order right below the current asking price and it gets filled within minutes. Yea you could set up auto buys on coinbase but I just cant justify paying those fees anymore. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:05:11
I know, my autocorrect changed the word. I edited my comment. Wasn’t trying to correct you.

What are you having problems with? Have you tried using GDAX? No fees to withdraw or deposit USD and free coin withdraws including the mining fee when you send coins from GDAX. It’s Coinbase’s trading platform.

Use Coinbase Pro. Deposit USD and place limit order. There is no fee. Otherwise if you use the Coinbase app you’re looking at a $120 fee to purchase 2 BTC. More if you use a debit card. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:36:59
Bro... I never said to keep your shit on Coinbase. Nice try though. I just like buying and sending my BTC to my own wallet for free. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 18:08:32
Not sure if it’s related to the holiday or not but everyone yelling bull run right now is going to be disappointed. This will continue to accumulate sideways for awhile, IMO.
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:51:50
Yea except the amounts are severely limited for those wanting or possessing large amounts. Coinbase is far superior to the cash app.
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:48:16
Use coinbase pro. Free to buy BTC and free to send it to an external wallet. Same login.
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:36:58
This is what I pictured after reading what you described
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:31:07
Especialy with the halving only a year and a half away.
@_date: 2018-12-20 18:05:09
Its not a bull run, for christ sake.
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:03:50
Plenty of exchanges offer really low fees for limit orders. Coinbase Pro offers free limit order trades. I could trade all day and never pay a fee. Don’t do it though cause I would just end up losing more than winning. I trade longer time frames. Entering long positions now for the next few months, for sells 1-2 years down the road. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:53:49
I would just stick with CB Pro honestly.
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:45:34

@_date: 2018-12-29 16:07:34
Why are you waiting two weeks to access your BTC? I don’t use the coinbase app because I use Pro.Coinbase.com, same login. I deposit USD from my bank, can take up to a week. Once your account is loaded with USD you can purchase and send it to an external wallet if you choose for free and instantly. I do this weekly and never pay a fee or even a mining fee to send it to any external wallet. 
If I’m in a pinch and the price is panic selling and I dont have USD on Pro, then I just use the bank purchase on the Coinbase app so I get the locked in price and eat the fee. Otherwise Im always using pro.coinbase.com. 
Cash app is fine I guess but Coinbase and Coinbase Pro are far superior than the cash app. Especially with purchase/sell limits and security. 
TL:DR try pro.coinbase.com before looking elsewhere. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:46:05
Nah fam, buckle down for some boring movement and probably lower prices. I wouldn’t expect any excitement until maybe end of next year. I’ve got no problem saying that it will eventually surpass previous ATH. This is a patience game

But but but...everyone has been screaming bullrun! You mean they have no idea what they’re talking about?
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:37:08
No, its the same company and its also the same login as your Coinbase account. You might have to register the first time and maybe provide Identification for it if you haven’t already for Coinbase. If you dont ever trade it might be intimidating but its very easy to use and saves a ton on fees when using limit orders, since they don’t charge fees on limit orders.
I agree, its a very good time to start buying some. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:49:51

Thats why its free to buy and send BTC. Coinbase charges fees for the conveniency when you can easily dollar cost average on Coinbase Pro without paying fees. Up to you.

This is true for almost any progressive idea to people who have lived doing something the old way for 60 years. They don’t have to care because they will miss the part where it changes the world anyway.
