Well, running bitcoin core is not something the average user does. I guess your argument still stands (OP's usage would amount to about a 20 year lifespan), but still.

The network wouldn't be blocked completely though, anybody willing to pay more than $0.50 could get his/her transaction across (if I understand correctly).

Link (or just paste) the addresses so we can have a look please

2024^12 ~= 5.444 x 10^39 .
8 billion people guessing 1 billion combinations per second for 100 years is ~ 2.52288 × 10^28 guesses. 
They would have about 1 in 200000000000 chance to guess your wallet.

Indeed, I don't see any transaction either.
1. How did you send the btc? What kind of wallet? How much?
2. Are you sure the address you pasted is correct?
3. Who did you recieve the bitcoin from? How long ago?
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:27:59
How is the inflation unnecessary though? When there are enough people willing to pay more than you do, then it is necessary to overbid them to get your transaction through.
The only way when higher fees are not necessary is when either people stop sending so many transactions or the network processes them at a faster rate. 
The second doesn't seem to be happening yet, so the first one is: people get discouraged by the high fees, don't send so many transactions, and the market finds balance. Fee market by definition.

I'd love to give you an approximation for that as well, but calculating the probability is complicated^1 and I'm way too tired for that right now. I'll try to make an other response tomorrow.
1: well ok formula is not that complicated, but because of the huge numbers it can't really be calculated ([wolfram alpha gives up at 100k guesses]( so it has to be approximated and that's a bit more involved
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:06:24
I'm not saying it's correct, I'm saying it's fee market by definition. It's not the fault of smart fee calculating BTC clients, it's by design.
Btw. yes I agree, currencies are meant to be used / traded and yes, I support scaling (who doesn't?)
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:19:13
You are right, and that's excellent insight. However, some extra game theory comes into play at that point.
Let's assume the mining power is divided between 10 miners instead of two. Every one of them fills their blocks with transactions that include the given fee floor, they get their investments instantly back, all of them profit. 
However, this system is not in balance (or in game theory terms, this is not a Nash equilibrium): it is profitable for any one of the miners to stop doing this and fill his block with organic transactions with lower fees, given that the others will uphold the floor anyways (well, the required fee changes by -1/10, but the extra transactions he included make up for that).
However, if every miner thinks likes this, the floor vanishes. Sure they may coordinate and form a cartel, keeping the floor up by an agreement. But at this point they may as well be a single entity, which means that decentralization is lost.
So unless the miners coordinate to do this (at which point the core concept of bitcoin is broken), this is not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-02-24 08:57:43
Ok. Let's assume there are 1 billon combinations with btc on them (distributed evenly, this means they all have 0.021btc of the 21 million). Let's assume the same number of guesses (8 billion people guessing 1 billion combinations per second for 100 years).
Using the union bound for an upper estimate and the bonferroni equations for a lower estimate, we get that the chance of them hitting at least one of the addresses is more than 3.6% but less than ~3.7%.
So they have about 3.7% chance to gain 0.021 btc.

FWIW the attack scales quadratically in the size of a single transaction, not the block. Allowing 2mb blocks doesn't need to mean allowing 2mb transactions as well. Simply limiting the size of individual transactions while allowing bigger blocks solves the issue.
@_date: 2016-01-27 14:01:09
Well, what if block size grows to 2mb but max transaction size is limited to 1mb? (as it is now, implicitly)
This would prevent the attack effectiveness increasing quadratically, making the attack only 2 times as effective.
@_date: 2016-01-27 18:54:22
Why are you so sure that it's me who doesn't understand the issue?
To me it seems quite simple: specially crafted transactions take quadratic time to validate. Right now the block size is max 1mb, thus the max transaction size is 1mb as well (since a transaction can't span multiple blocks). If we increased the max blocksize to 2mb, we would increase the max transaction size to 2mb as well, making these specially crafted transactions validate 4 times slower (2^2 = 4, quadratic increase). 
This means that if they took 3 minutes before the doubling, they now take 12 minutes to validate: (1\*n)^2 = n^2 = 3 minutes =&gt; (2\*n)^2 = 4\*n^2 = 12 minutes. That's too much. 
However if we limit the max transaction size to 1mb, then it increases to 6 minutes:  2\*(1\*n)^2 = 2\*n^2 = 6 minutes (two 1mb transactions in the block). The increase is linear. Think of it like 2 1mb blocks released at once.
If that is still too much, we could limit the max blocksize to 0.5mb, giving us 4*(n/2)^2 = n^2 = 3 minutes (4 transactions of 0.5mb in a 2mb block). Given of course, that 0.5mb transactions are big enough for all non-malicious uses. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:35:34
Yes, that is correct. We define block differently, but whatever.


Which is only possible through backward incompatible breaks anyways, at which point there are other means to prevent it.
Hurrah, we are on the same page finally.
@_date: 2016-01-28 09:21:26
Thank you, this link was useful.
However, I'm not sure I understand the reasoning. Instead of transaction size we should limit sigops, but this approachs makes an other type of attack possible, where malicious transactions exhaust the sigop limit. But if this is the case, why is it better to limit sigops instead of transaction size?
P.S - I understand that segwit is a nice thing to have, and I'm all for it. I'm just arguing that increasing the blocksize right now, without segwit, may be possible.
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:14:12
Fees should be relative to size (as in bytes). The second transaction takes up more space -&gt; more fee required.

I don't agree with your reasoning about denouncing things. If core doesn't agree with the moderation policy, it has to be denounced - not because core doesn't agree with it, but because it seems to be supporting core.
I don't publicly denounce every random opinion that I disagree with, however if e.g someone started punching people who didn't side with me in an argument, I'd put an effort into making it clear that I didn't agree with his methods (given, of course, that I didn't).
That said, I know that you did speak up against it, and thank you for that.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:26:23
I think you have problems with terminology.


This is incorrect. On Testnet, there were already Segwit blocks above 3.5MB. It LITERALLY is bigger.
**Effective** blocksize increase means that **yes, it increases transaction throughput**. I never said it didn't.
It, however, doesn't **literally** increase the blocksize, instead it attaches "witness" data to the blocks that is **segregated** from said blocks. Thus this change doesn't effect the ability of an attacker to perform quadratic hashing attacks. However, it doesn't prevent currently available attack vectors either.
I'm not arguing that segwit doesn't help the network scale. I'm saying that it doesn't fix quadratic scaling attacks. That is only possible with breaking compatibility.
Before you once again start rehashing arguments against a backwards incompatible break: I didn't even say that was preferable. Stop repeating the same thing.
Edit: Btw. the fact that you suspect me of "intentionally spreading lies and misinformation for an agenda" because you fail to understand what I'm saying says a lot about you tho.
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:30:27
Segwit soft fork is irrelevant to bigger block sizes, because it is not possible to raise the 1mb limit in a soft fork. Sure, in case of a hard fork we can make segwit transactions mandatory. But in the case of a hard fork, there are other ways to fix these issues.
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:11:05
And the miners protect the blockchain against attacks by sheer hashpower, with a lot of equipment that was bought / produced for a lot of money.
See, bitcoin couldn't exists without developers, and couldn't exist without miners either. But it's the users (holders, mainly) that give bitcoin its value.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:22:26


It is the only thing that matters when talking about quadratic hashing related attacks.
Though yes, with the new block weight system it is mostly irrelevant when talking about transaction throughput (not completely, since the "3-to-1 ratio" is measured in terms of the 1, which is 1mb, specified by the code variable, but whatever).
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:00:43
The only way that doesn't require a hard fork you mean. Also, segwit only fixes quadratic hashing for segwit transactions, which will not be mandatory. This means that it fixes accidental quadratic hashing situations, but doesn't do shit about real attacks.
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:08:22
Still, there would be no competitive advantage because of faster propagation.
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:46:16
As wrote, it's done by setting yourself a time period and an amount and buying according to that, for example spending 288usd every monday for 52 weeks on bitcoin, regardless of the price.
Statistically you are guaranteed to hit highs and lows alike, thus your average buying price will be somewhere in the middle. Trying to predict highs and lows and buying according to that is fun, but it's really hard to do reliably. If you believe that the price will go up long term, buying on average price is absolutely fine.
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:00:55
It is however possible to craft a block that is invalid to any segwit-enabled miner, but valid to anyone else*. If this happens, it results in a chain split. If the majority of miners is not segwit-enabled, the split persists. If the majority is segwit enabled, the rest of the network will reorg to orphan the "segwit-invalid" chain after a while.
*Explanation: Since in segwit the "who can spend this money" part of the transaction is segregated from the block itself, miners and nodes not following the segwit protocol will see this as "anyone can spend". If someone indeed does spend it without signing, then miners and nodes with segwit enabled will see this as invalid, but anyone without segwit enabled will see it as valid.
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:34:50
I second this. If you believe in bitcoin and you don't want to gamble, you should do dollar cost averaging and hold long-term.

For example old transaction compatibility can be kept by keeping the size of old-style transactions limited (as they are now). Since the quadratic scaling issue is quadratic in the size of the transaction, not the size of the block, this makes it a non-problem. Either we can limit the size of individual old-style transactions, or limit the sum of their size (1mb?).
The remainder of the block can be filled up with segwit transactions or "flexible transactions" (bip 134). Viola.
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:58:14


Segwit softfork is obviously unable to touch the 1mb limit coded in the protocol. Segwit is an **effective** blocksize increase, not a **literal** one. If we choose to do a **literal** blocksize increase, segwit doesn't help with the quadratic scaling attacks that become more severe with the bigger block sizes. However, at that point there are other ways to fix that.
The much celebrated quadratic scaling fix is only fixing accidental quadratic hashing situations, not deliberate attacks.

A hard fork doesn't necessarily 'mutate' the blockchain in the sense that immutability is usually used. It doesn't have to change anything in the past, only the protocol going forward, i.e the future.
Or are you afraid that people will get greedy and propose history rewriting hard forks because some protocol change was implemented by a hard fork instead of a soft fork?
@_date: 2017-01-31 15:46:02
It's not going to happen imo, but on a theoretical level, that would be a really interesting scenario to watch.
@_date: 2017-01-17 07:47:27
Stop with this nonsense reasoning please. If the miners collectively switch to a new protocol, then it doesn't make a damn bit of difference what several governments want.
Oh yes, they could attack it, but then they could attack it without the fork as well.
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:25:43
Hard-forking *without consensus* results in a split, and that would be bad. However without consensus, we shouldn't soft-fork either (and we aren't going to, that's why segwit hasn't gone through so far).
Hard fork + consensus = no split. ETH/ETC is a different situation, since half the community decided they would fork without consensus.

Yeah those 2, but also that your intuitions mislead you when trading. You feel like buying when it's green and you feel like selling when it's red. You kinda should do the opposite... buy after dips and sell after bull runs.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:20:34
Wouldn't that be a much more obvious attack?
@_date: 2015-11-29 09:42:51
I agree. Using 'first seen', while idealistic, is going against the interests of the miners, and tbh, they can choose freely between the two options, regardless of 'official guidelines' (i.e the official bitcoin core). 
The trustless nature of bitcoin lies in the fact that even if everyone behaves selfishly, the system still works (in fact, some parts of it work exacly because of that - with a few notable exceptions, like one mining pool becoming 'too good' and possibly attracting 50%+ miners). 
This change just admits the fact that 'first seen' is a rule that can't be enforced anyways, and is a rule that goes straight against the dynamics of the system. I think it is very much in the spirit of 'satoshi's vision'.
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:39:37
The thing is, it does have an expiration date. If the price doesn't go up significantly, then after a few block reward halvings we are gonna lose a lot of miners. No miners = low difficulty = low security against an 51% attack = bitcoin is kill.
I'm not sure how much time we have, but it's not infinite.

1. Many people bet their money on those cryptographic methods already, probably including you. It would be disasterous not just to the bitcoin community but everybody in the modern world. However, such developments don't usually happen overnight. You could also say, "what if a sunburst wipes out all the data from all of the computers, including the bitcoin network?" When that happens, bitcoin is not the most important thing we are going to lose.
2. Even if the core devteam decides to act maliciously, there are other bitcoin clients, it's just a reference client. The majority of the network would have to run their malicious software to ruin bitcoin. But since we can check the source, if they turn on us, we can switch to other clients.
3. You seem convinced.
4. That is a problem. Wonder why there is such a big fuss about goverments allowing/not allowing, regulating/not regulating bitcoin? But it's not a bad thing, it is a feature. Uncontrollable money, that was the goal to begin with.

That's not technically correct, actually. If they double their power they are still below 50%.
Imagine 100 computers mining bitcoin, 30 owned by Ghash. Ghash buys 30 more, so there are now 130 computers mining, 60 of which are owned by Ghash. Thats 46%. Pretty close, but not 50%.
