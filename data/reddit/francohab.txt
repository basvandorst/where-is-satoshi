Are you sure?  I’m sure there’s already some troll going through his post history to find a way to reach his wife and tell her.  Never ever underestimate internet, OP, delete this!

I always wondered how the bitcoin payment actually happen in a shop. Do they actually wait 10 minutes to get the first confirmation?

The term “blockchain” encompasses much more than the “hashed linked list” data structure.  It also includes the “social engineering” part that permits to reach consensus among nodes that can’t be trusted.  That's the real novelty, the data structure in itself is really nothing new, and wouldn't be worth all that hype.  And PoW or PoS are an essential part of that social engineering part. 
The idea is that the system is secure, because we can trust the consensus. We can trust the consensus because of the miners, and that mining is open to everyone. People mine because it brings them money (not because they “care about the system”). It brings them money because the token has value. And the token has value because the system is secure and can be trusted. This closes the loop, and we have a bootstrapped system. 
I invite you to read/watch the blockchain course of Princeton, they explain that ( - I think it's in the second lecture)

He would have cashed out way earlier.  At 1000% for example.
