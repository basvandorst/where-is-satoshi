+100 luke-jr !  New users should have to download the entire blockchain and wait for it to sync when experiencing bitcoin for the very first time. Anything to protect them from this monstrosity that cannot be fixed. 
  VIM user represent!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:26:40
that is what their exchange GDAX is for. It's called trading. You can use their main site coinbase but the fees are crazy. Coinbase is more for regular users who want to buy and hold or sell and withdraw and sending receiving.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:19:35
I just realized you are probably asking about slippage and liquidity.  Yes that is what makes real time trading risky. That is why traders usually do limit orders and scale in and out, they try to plan ahead of time.
 So say you panic and market sell or buy on gdax, you might not get the price you wanted because there were no buyers or sellers left at that price.  
 But you should also consider Coinbase itself gets its own prices from their own exchange and calculates a spread and fees to make up for any losses they might have. That is why sometimes the price on coinbase is way higher than the exchange. They are tacking on fees and premiums to cover it. which can be just as costly and risky.
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:33:43
yes you can set limit orders (no fees), stops for when it reaches certain price (fees if it hits) or you can straight up market sell or buy (has fees).
i suggest you know what you are doing first though. I wouldn't play around with big amounts. The lowest bid/sell amount is a dollar.
Also, traders usually develop a strategy and study charts. A good site to learn and chat about ideas with other bitcoin traders is 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:20:08
yes it will just remove the transaction. It will be like you never sent it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:02:20
only a 34 dollar fee?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:30:13
every time you open your wallet it will broadcast the transaction to the mempool. If you don't keep broadcasting it, it should drop it and show no pending transactions with previous balance after 2 weeks. It has happened to me many times. I rarely send bitcoin or use it anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:17:05
It will probably get rejected after 2 weeks. If mempool and fees don't go down and you don't want to pay a high enough fee you probably will never get to spend it. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:16:15
Because people were paying with bitcoin and not paying a high fee like you so the transaction didn't confirm in time and when it did finally confirm the price of bitcoin changed so much they didn't send the correct amount and it was sent back minus  a damn high fee anyway and it left them with a few dollars that they probably can't move now. 
I imagine they probably got tired of hearing users email them and complain about high fees and refunds.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:06:10
Why would you try to send bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:32:22
I don't think lightning network will solve this problem right away. It will take months if not years to fully be adopted by everyone. even then i see the main chain still being bogged down by people around the world sending regular bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:43:13
I'm not sure, but if you're saying you are using two wallets with the same key it doesn't matter, because once the transaction hits the mempool it stays  for 2 weeks unless confirmed  regardless of what wallet you view it from.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:54:04
I bet the mempool fills up again today or next. Depending on what news coverage it receives in different parts of the world and it really picks up when price starts to move. Plus it is Sunday and early morning right now in most of the states. Sundays are usually the most quiet days during the week for bitcoin.
One more thing, if  Several hundred thousand new users just lost $15 - $30 dollars on average on a fee they don't understand and their transaction is stuck for hours or days you think they will send another one anytime soon to fill up the mempool? No. I bet they are mad as hell.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:39:35
 I don't think it is under attack.
 Do you know how many users coinbase has been adding? Have you checked bitcoin on google trends lately against other popular search terms? It is one of the most talked about things on the planet right now.
This is prime time and what mainstream looks like,  too bad it couldn't be ready and handle new users who are probably frustrated as hell right now losing money. This is the new norm for now and it might get worse. $30 dollar fees might be cheap soon.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:20:30
This happened to me using the Electrum Bitcoin Wallet for some reason.
 I had to copy the raw transaction data and rebroadcast it on a block explorer so it made it to the mempool.
Not sure what is going on. 
*It also it happened to me using the Jaxx wallet. But i couldn't copy transaction data so I had to export my private keys and import them into another wallet to get a transaction to go through.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:40:25
I agree with most of what you said but even a week before that the mempool filled up, recently we really only had a few days here and there in this huge spike up where fees were almost normal. I predict as more and more users use bitcoin we will soon have no days of clearing the mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:14:13
You think everyone that buys bitcoin on coinbase are traders and leave their coins on gdax?  The first thing most new users do is send some to a friend or personal wallet to try it out. Some are probably buying as a gift and making cute little christmas theme paper wallets minus a huge fee.
And hell yeah it reached a high Thursday because it was all over the news about all time high and then bitcoin started to pull back probably cause people to panic and move coins around.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:10:34
They are probably backed up with users asking the same questions that you are.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:38:21
wasn't there an exchange that had gift cards? or maybe i am imagining that.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:58:32
Down vote me all you want but i am speaking as a damn holder and actual user of bitcoin who currently has a two transactions stuck and lost money trying to purchase a gift card because it didn't confirm in time.
I'm not just some dumbass trader that buys up something he don't use while yelling moon all the time getting his stops hit.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:36:24
I think this video is missing a few steps. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:27:44
well people yesterday were saying the mempool was clearing but now it is just going sideways and slowly climbing back up. this might be the the new norm until hype dies down.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:40:00
 Honestly as a bitcoin fan I think its not ready because it's not user friendly and because it has one hurdle and that hurdle is the cause of it not being user friendly, you have to first open and then close channels which are transactions on the main blockchain to receive your payment. I'm not sure it will ever be completely user friendly but I look forward to the finish product.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:22:49
I could be wrong, but I also think you have to leave your wallet closed and not connect to the network or it will resend it to the mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:00:21
Why are you trying to spend P2P money crypto currency?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:03:34
yep it depends how many addresses are used in the transaction. Some wallets leave small amounts in some addresses when sending and receiving or if you received from multiple addresses. So you can end up with many over time and then when you try to spend more than you have in one address it collects all the other addresses and send them all at once which results in a very large fee.
@_date: 2016-03-08 11:45:12
"there is a vast and growing income and wealth inequality in the world."  in the world yes, in western nations?  eh, not so sure.  Actually some of the developing countries are doing about as good as us now since they produce much of everything we buy. Their lives are drastically improving compared to ours this is true. That is not to say that is all bad since there are jobs back here based on selling cheap goods for a profit, but since they pay they their workers next to nothing it makes those jobs that stayed here worth less .
How can this generation afford  a mortgage when they eat out every other day, have a monthly mobile data plan and other unnecessary monthly credit bills that are  the size of a mortgage payment and college tuition? I don't know. ;) 
They have done studies and  even the experts are unsure what is causing this so called divide.  I believe it is  consumerism and a whole industry set up to sell over priced goods that this generation and now the older generations buy up with credit. It seems like nobody cares about the price of anything anymore until the bill arrives in the mail. 
average yearly income indexed for inflation looks about right.
Now If you look at mortgage housing payment to income ratio it has been about the same or less for the past 30 years.
They should do a detailed study and figure out what each generation spent most of their money on throughout the years.  i think that would tell us a lot. 
I bet most in this generation would say they spend a good chunk of it on food by eating out every other day at some strictly profit driven restaurant chain  or they go grocery shopping for  over priced processed name brand foods without even using a coupon or checking the receipt. I bet some spend at least $200 or more with a credit card on some made overseas gadget  or  go shopping online for over priced clothing also made overseas that retails for 100 times what it cost to produce. I bet some might even have a $300 a month high interest car loan for a car produced overseas with expensive insurance because others in their age bracket were texting on the phone while driving.
Every dollar adds up after awhile and not only are they spending most of their money on things that are not necessities they are spending most of their money on items produced overseas or at companies that give nothing back to their community. 
This generation needs an accountant and a mirror. 
Boomers do many of those things now too and are struggling in retirement with monthly bills. they are living the same way and paying for the same things, only difference is some of them were able to buy a home when life was cheap and simple, and not because homes were cheap because they weren't.
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:31:55
We definitely need to address the usability issues. 
**Buying and storing bitcoins.**
Secure wallets that let you purchase bitcoins instantly. This should be the first introduction for new users. Users shouldn't have to go to multiple places to get set up.
**Bitcoin refill cards should be the next step in user adoption.**
**Bitcoin exchanges** need to cut out the middle man entirely. Why should users have to wait to get verified, make a deposit online then wait for their bitcoins?  Just sell "bitcoin refill cards" at stores and online. These cards wouldn't hold bitcoin but would be redeemable for bitcoins once scanned or entered into the wallet. Yeah some will get lost or stolen but you're a business that can cover the risk. Like every other gift card company.
Quit treating each bitcoin like it's a Pablo Picasso painting. Treat them like mass merchandise that needs to be shipped.
**Bitcoin behind the scenes** 
Services that utilize bitcoin for transferring funds off and on chain but don't have their customers use them is another evolution that needs to happen. Bitpay is ahead of the curve on this one. Still waiting for that service that nobody knows is using bitcoin in the background. Remittance services in developing countries that don't have wide spread access to internet and technology is good place for this type of service. Another one would be online sites that issue their own credit system.
Then they could convert it to local currencies or in house credits saving the ones that don't know about bitcoin the headache of figuring out bits, mBTC, Bitcoin conversion rates.  
**Information and websites.**
Bitcoin.org needs to be more user friendly and focused. 
It's the number one result on google and the first thing non technical users see. Right now it falls some where in between with advance user and noob information all mixed together.  Bitcoin core is the first option listed for desktop wallets and you know its the first one average joe probably downloads and is like why is it taking years to sync?  Too many choices. How to buy bitcoins redirects to a totally different looking site that lists like 50 exchanges on one page that takes awhile to load and it doesn't even list the most popular exchanges first.
It should have two sections the first one (the main splash page) should just point new users to a couple wallets that are also exchanges and explain bitcoin in a few paragraphs like coinbase and circle does at the bottom of their main pages.  The second section could be for people who want to dig deeper and get to know the inner workings of bitcoin with all the available listed information now.

sidechains are optional right? meaning that there will be less people securing sidechains correct? Wont some of those sidechains end up being less secure and centralized? why not make use of the decentralized computing power securing bitcoins blockchain?
 or am I missing something?

How many generations have had it better than this generation?
 I would say none. The boomers didn't have it that good. I'm sure some did , just like some in your generation are millionaires, but if you look at the majority of boomers they didn't go to college and they worked min wage jobs. Another thing to consider is this generation spends all their money and time on expensive gadgets, internet, entertainment and clothing. Boomers and generations before them had less crap to spend money on and less time to sit around and be entertained.  This generation feels entitled and betrayed, but to previous generations it probably looks spoiled and lazy. But if anything this has nothing to do with what generation you are from and more to do with economic policy and greed.

I don't think bitcoin went far enough. The reward is still too high for far too long. It should have halved faster. It might not be a good investment for new users for years down the road and by then who knows what will happen. Early adopters on the other hand are still in a good place, but even their bitcoin investments depend on new user growth and current holders/buyers.
I wish inflation was around 2 percent now instead of 9 percent.

Good read, but NXT was never in the news for raising over 100 million dollars or reaching 1 billion dollar market cap. I've been in bitcoin a long time and still don't know what NXT is or care because I don't see that many people talking about it.  You go to both bitcoin subs today and ETH talk is front page news. ETH is a worthy competitor of bitcoin in my opinion and bitcoin should treat it as such. We should not dismiss it as some alt coin. Bitcoin needs to scale and evolve faster so it can do everything eth can and do it better.

Still better than the current bitcoin.org site that looks like someone's pet project instead of a world class payments platform. 
But yeah, still waiting for a main bitcoin domain that looks and feels like paypal or circle and gets users up and running with a couple clicks. One that doesn't list a full node as the first wallet option. QT design is bad enough, but making new users download the entire blockchain and sync up is one way to make sure they never come back. Full nodes should be for advance users. 
*I still wonder how many potential bitcoin users we have lost because of this bad choice.
@_date: 2016-05-12 20:29:31
I agree it is slow and I don't like slow, but the design and layout is better. Not completely sold on the logo either. They offer full node as first wallet option as well, which again is a terrible choice for news users who are not computer literate and hate waiting more than 5 mins for anything.
