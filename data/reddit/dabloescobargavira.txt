Certainly do

Of course! Haha

You don't control the keys. If you did, it would not be possible.
@_date: 2015-12-12 02:41:58
Thank you!!!!!!!!

This is potentially the only theory where this guy is actually satoshi! I think you're on to something
@_date: 2015-12-12 02:27:52
Is there any proof at all that this is actually an attack? Because this site is one of the most poorly coded and run sites in wide use today, it crashes all the time, especially when the price is rising. 
I VERY much doubt they are being attacked, for one there is no motive, for another it just seems more likely to be the result of incompetence

Suppose they don't?

Bunch of people I work with are big into this, it makes zero fucking sense to me yet somehow they're making money hand over fist...
But j guess they feel the same way about me and Bitcoin so what do I know

I keep seeing Hotwire, is this the same company that's like an Expedia clone? Or is it a different company with the same name?

That's why he all these beginner coding books in his amazon wishlist!!!

What is this argument even based on? It will destroy wars? Please explain how?
And deter ISIS? Unfortunately no one can stop them from using BTC, which is the best part of BTC, no one can stop anyone from using it

Really disappointed in the editors at Wired, this article shouldn't even be necessary. A cursory glance at the initial Wright=Satoshi  headlines shouted hoax to anyone with half a clue...

Giving my newborn nephew 1 BTC tomorrow, was gonna get a savings bond but this is a lot more interesting

They are reporting to the IRS if they are AML compliant lol. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 02:31:48
That's.... Not actually that crazy of a theory
Though it's a wicked stupid idea
@_date: 2015-12-12 02:38:36
Wtf? Is there any legitimate reason for this to be the case?
And if this were the actual claim, wouldn't it be fairly simple for the ATO to simply check his passport for a stamp from Iceland?
Surely he wouldn't have us believe that he 'owns' this supercomputer yet he's never been to see it?

If they accept US customers, I promise they still send CTRs
@_date: 2016-03-28 06:11:26
Oh that's actually a hilarious explanation that makes perfect sense. Fuck I guess I'm finally gonna give up on them, can anyone recommend their favorite BTC price checking app? As simple an interface as possible please

Unfortunately while methods of obfuscation exist, the blockchain works because it is a public ledger. It will never be anonymous, it was never meant to be
@_date: 2016-02-16 23:49:51
I mean as far as Surveillance goes...
Bitcoin and the blockchain have made it easier than ever
