Thinking about this aspect I find it strange that Bitcoin at this point is only a benefit to "high rollers" in this regard. But at the same time, I could see how financial intermediaries, who are already making a killing on transaction fees right now, aren't the biggest fans of the tech. On the other-other hand the potential for ROI for institutional asset managers might outweigh the negatives. Shitty for Western Union, not so much for deep-pocketed investors looking to get in on some of the action. Do you know if there are steps that Bitcoin is taking to correct this disparity between small and large transactions?

Almost there buddy...

That's what's confusing me here. Isn't the idea that price is directly related to transaction speed, as lower fee offers are disincentivized over higher fees. Or has the transaction system changed. Also, isn't there a scenario where, with a fixed number of BTC in circulation, miners will no longer "make" the transaction fee, and will thus drive fees down to zero, since there's no more Bitcoin to be paid out for completing blocks. And if that's the case, where's the incentive for PoW at that point anyway?

Wait wtf, aren't the usual ones 3-6mg? Holy shit dude.

Oh cool that makes sense, thanks!

Yeah, starting out on bittrex fucked me up, and I learned my greatest lesson when I bought ARK for 35 dollars. Lucked up and only ended up buying one, but boy did I feel like a fucking idiot. Tried to find my fuck up in the candlesticks but to no avail.

lol that's not what decentralized. The network is decentralized, as in there is no single party who controls the movement of funds. That is distributed throughout the nodes in the network. On the other hand, decisions about protocol and future developments are made by democratic consensus among a trust-less network of governance (I may not have this entirely right, but this consists of mainly miners and developers), "trust-less" because the systems allows people who do not know each other to agree on rules for the group through voting power. Do businesses get to make decisions about the financial structure of a bank? No, because the bank has all the say. That's a centralized system. "Decentralized" means that there's no single governing body that makes decisions on behalf of everyone involved. When you say "people are working on improving it", you fail to realize that those people are part of a community with consensus protocols, and not a bunch of guys in a boardroom.
Thought I'd give you what remedial information I know about the system, instead of chastising you for the stupidity of it. Which doesn't obviate the latter fact. 
Try learning about what you're talking about before you talk about it. I say that earnestly, for your sake and for the sake of your future interlocutors.

Thanks, that's what I figured. Do the wallets just function on a fixed fee, or do people just not think to change it?

"Losing" money? I don't think so. Making it? Questionable. My question is, how discreet is Venmo? Because I've been using it for other things than paying a friend for dinner (nothing nefarious, just off the books), and I'm wondering whether come April they might send those records along to Uncle Sam...

But I guess the fear becomes that it develops into a system for moving wealth, and provides little benefit for the small-time user. Is it Iota that's working on micro transactions and fee-less services? Seems like it would be fruitful to look into cryptos that are looking to serve those who aren't moving large chunks of cash around.

Or you know, crypto...

Anyone know why the power output on the light switch goes "below" zero right when it's switched off, but then comes up a tiny bit once it's in the off position? Don't know if I explained that right, but it's kind of bugging me.

I only spend Bitcoin on altcoins. Is that spending or trading? Is that ok?
