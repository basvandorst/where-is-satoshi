Who said we aren't a bubble?

Wait a moment, I use Bitcoin Wallet by Andreas Schildbach, so the only thing I have to do is update the app as soon as it gets a new update. But do I still have to create a new address?

Hey what about Digital Playground? 
@_date: 2013-05-19 21:56:44
I recommend using something like Google Sites or Jimdo to make the website. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:05:37

El mundo es un periódico de derechas y seguramente sus dueños son amigos de algunos banqueros importantes. Así va mi país, no hay nada que el pueblo pueda hacer al respecto. [eldiario.es]( es el periódico que yo leo, os lo recomiendo. Now feel free to translate this with Google Translate.

Please someone explain this to me.
