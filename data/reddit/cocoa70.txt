I've been using the Atombit wallet for almost a year now with no issues. They have very good support and you can buy bitcoins directly in the app itself with a Paypal account.

If you use an iPhone and have a Paypal account, the Atombit wallet app is the fastest way to buy up to one bitcoin per day. They also have amazing support compared to other mobile apps and services.

Currently, None. They can close accounts at will, without notice, at any time so be prepared.

Selling BTC via Paypal can be done successfully as Atombit has proven however, the risk to the seller is quite high if you don't have a strong buyer vetting procedure. In your case, ABSOLUTELY WAIT for Paypal's decision BEFORE sending the buyer the Bitcoins. You are actually in the best possible position with Paypal right now.

RBF will kill this BTC spending experience...

Why make it easier to double spend ? Allowing only the fee to change seems to make the most sense if the purpose of this is to get a transaction out of a low fee priority. Am I missing something ???
