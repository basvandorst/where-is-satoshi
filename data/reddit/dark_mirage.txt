Tldw of why it would have a chance of tripling?

I'd put it on my bitpay card, usually takes about 2-3 minutes to get ready to spend.
@_date: 2017-02-19 09:21:01
Use a PayPal debit card and coinbase

This sub sparked nothing. They had a system that was heavily recommended by everyone, not just reddit, I'm talking 4chan, btc forums, irc rooms, local enthusiasts, and more, to buy bitcoins, I think it'd be a safe bet to say that was the use case for 80% of circle users, and they removed the feature. Then the people who used it for that feature ONLY no longer had any use for it whatsoever, therefore, it deserves a 1 star review. They stabbed their userbase in the back.

Well noto has emoji also. Your post should be "Noto-sans has bitcoin too" since noto isn't the default font for arch.

And just to point out, I sent ethereum yesterday, it took 5 minutes to get 40 confirmations, and the fee was less than 25 cents.

Coinbase is a blip on the radar
@_date: 2017-01-31 15:22:38
All of these questions are literally a 20 second Google search. "1 btc to USD" tells you the price of a bitcoin and you don't even have to click a link. Mining bitcoins requires expensive hardware, and electricity usually isn't free, that's your investment. There are services like bitpay that bridge the gap between btc and stores that don't accept them, and idk about android pay.
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:08:11
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:00:26
That isn't even very high, fees are ridiculous right now.
@_date: 2017-01-23 05:03:29
So why keep advanced users from buying and holding btc?
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:30:13
Oh well let me just ask my crystal ball

Wow turns out logging is disabled by default in irssi, I just checked. You should check out weechat, or use a bouncer if you want everything logged.

If coinbase tries to start freezing accounts for "suspicious" activity, I will stop using them for good.
@_date: 2017-01-24 11:55:38
Probably not, but why? 99.99999% of irc clients have a logger enabled by default.

If you're seriously so broke that you're buying percentage of cents of btc, you need to evaluate your finances.

Nobody will call it the NA, NA defaults to either "Not applicable" or "Naturally aspirated" to most people.

I auto deposit fiat money to the card, never used the wallet, so how does this affect me? Will I still be able to transfer btc to fiat with the card?

@_date: 2016-12-02 15:48:32
So wait... I could convert 50$ into 5400 jpy, and buy an entire bitcoin with it?

Op, where do you live? I'm looking to buy a car.
@_date: 2016-12-15 21:14:13
How long did you wait
@_date: 2016-12-15 23:07:01
Then just use bitpay
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:25:53
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:36:47
As in the USA? Unlikely.

As someone who has 0 idea what segwit or bu is, and subscribed to both a long time ago... They aren't the most toxic of the two. But neither are good by any means, especially since I don't even understand the whole argument to begin with, something like you both support different forks? And what is segwit and unlimited, are they alt coins?
@_date: 2017-04-21 11:50:56
Hey calm down, I want e trying to offend you. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 05:32:49
Coinbase is probably the fastest, at least.

You are getting completely ripped off
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:26:44
You put them in an offline wallet
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:42:39
That's not what hold means
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:05:16
No it's a misspell of hold. Meaning you don't sell. There wallet means nothing as long as you don't sell.

I still have no idea why you guys are fighting.
@_date: 2017-07-12 07:01:13
Yes. Not sure where you're seeing that, I have a bitpay account without a business. On their website, I think I remember a big button that says "Get a bitpay card"
@_date: 2017-05-05 00:42:30
You don't know how this works, lol
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:01:31
You know the whole community is nearly split in two over bip141, right?

Do your parents know that you're on reddit?
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:13:50
In order to spend that at a store, you'll need the bitpay debit card, which is more like a prepaid debit card that is loaded from the bitpay wallet. I have one and really like it, you can even direct deposit to it, but it should be noted that the bitcoins have to be essentially "sold" into fiat, which gets transferred to the card, it cannot spend an equivalent amount of btc for each transaction as the transactions occur.
