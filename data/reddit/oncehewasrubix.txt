Omg.... Coinbase Juuust got back to me.... Yes. Regarding this very issue. *mind blown*
Moving to CoinKite
@_date: 2014-01-10 07:56:24
I would gladly wait a day to buy a coin than pay a ridiculous premium. At that point you're gauging your own impatience. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 09:33:09
Aaaaaaand it's gone.
I'm done with Coinbase. That's nonsense. I'll vote with my money thank you very much. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 07:55:11
*waits a week and a half for these questions to be answered*
@_date: 2014-01-10 09:36:04
This is garbage. No thank you. I'll use BTC-e or CampBX :) and store offline or with Coinkite. Coinkite also has LTC integration.

Time = Money
I was just messing with you. But doge is a joke. If bitcoin was a - real dollar, doge is a postit note with a dollar sign and a picture of a dog scribbled on it
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:19:35
No... It's because you hopped on a bandwagon full of jokers and blew some money while onboard. 
Seriously.. Doge? *mind blown* 
Kids these days...
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:18:14
Seriously.. Doge? Sell it all and buy bitcoin... Wasting time with stupid AltCoins. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:58:38
That makes no sense
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:37:33
Yeah I didn't think that through did I...
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:19:38
I handed him a $20 bill.
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:55:11
Imagine how much you could have saved not buying Doge.
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:58:56
That makes no sense. Such wow.
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:07:20
The paper wallet address shows that it had 1.26BTC on it...
Removed Info - Issue Resolved - Thank you everyone for your help.
Looks like it might be a Coinbase issue? I've already sent them a ticket/support request. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:27:44
Ok really weird...
So I reimported my BTC from the paper wallet.
Now the .26 are in my account.
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:02:33
Awesome! Sent them a nice note welcoming them. I work in Santa Monica and I'm amazed to see how few places here take BTC, in what is supposed to be "Silicon Beach."
Congrats to FlowerLab
Great work too!
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:44:20
I've already done so. I'm literally just waiting for the stupid 30 day wait period to end. I've already purchased successfully twice now. I'm fully verified. I have the secondary payment added. I've sent them a total of two (maybe three) emails. I received one response, similar to everyone else's ( blah blah try again we're not always 100% accurate). 
I'll try sending them an email with a request to speak to someone via telephone.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:18:23
Totally forgot about that. Jesus apple... Walled garden much?
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:34:22
thanks for your help ;)
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:39:56
I guess so. Moving on. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:22:38
Someone clearly doesn't use Bank Of America....
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:01:30
Yeah..... Guilty.
Sorry about that. I'm pretty good with Your and you're though. Haha..
For a guy my age... What a shame.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:08:41
I lost it in a tragic boating accident.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:51:27
That worked. Thanks. Man, is that a bizarre user path for a validation. It's a critical pathway, it should have a much easier, and more obvious flow. IxD/UX fail.
Btce eventually got back to me. I was freaking out.  
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:03:26
I'm starting to think the only thing "Silicon beach" is translating to is insanely high rent.
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:45:37
Yeah, I've noticed they are suuuuuuuper slow to reasons to inquires. 
Lame, but aside from all this, so far it's been better than mtgox. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:45:23
I had a similar thought. I figure once I do my part in showing them that there are people who are interested in using bitcoin, they're free to do what they want, I've done my part.
Thanks for the links. I should poked around there before posting.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:51:26
People have been selling bitcoin on eBay/paypal for several years? Fact check anyone? 
Best of luck.
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:37:00
Thanks for all your help :) Happy New Years :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:10:36
Went ahead and purchased... Got this...
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:41:13
I've been with Coinbase for a minute now. I have to say, they're probably one of the worst when it comes to responding to tickets or issues. Any support request should be given a 3-5day lead. You send it, wait 3-5days, then start bitching. 
Coinkite is waaaaaay better at responding to support requests. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:53:23
Commas.... *killing me*
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:40:49
Doge makes no sense to me. Between the cheap MS paint graphics and the ridiculous "much wow" and "many smarts" - it just looks like another Reddit meme-alt-coin...
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:31:59
The .26 didn't show up when I imported the wallet to Coinbase.
I understand that the paper wallet is not hosted on/by coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:00:35
Usually my schtick goes something like,
"Do you take bitcoin"
"Bitcoin is a digital currency"
"Bitpay or Coinkite offer POS terminals/services for businesses interested in accepting bitcoin payments"
[ill jot down some links for you]
^^ this is where those business cards I was making would come in handy. Explaining 2-3 things about bitcoin, and pointing the individual to Bitpay or Bitcoin.org.
If they're clueless still, or uninterested, much like this guy, I drop it. Someone else will come by and ask them the same shit.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:22:14
thank you, I'll take it there.
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:19:44
Sent the email this morning... That makes it 4 emails now... *turning blue*
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:32:51
I've made it a habit of asking merchants/stores/businesses if they accept Bitcoin as a payment option. I'm considering making business cards with a QR code on one side, and the BTC symbol on the other, with a web address and some notes regarding bitcoin and it's use.
Theres a smoke shop near me that considered it when they decided they no longer wanted to deal with their credit card machines and fees, and took up Square Reader. The guy working said they didn't  like the volatility, or the idea of letting goods leave for .2BTC today, only to find that .2BTC is worth much less the next day.
I mentioned Bitpay, and locked exchange rates which help mitigate this kind of worry, and better facilitate equal daily transactions and exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:24:05
Thanks for your help BTW.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:00:30
Local bitcoins.... the joy of paying $50-$100 more than the asking price.
Here in Santa Monica... 1BTC 677.03 USD on local bitcoin... Thats about $75 over the exchanges
Another seller is asking 817.11 USD

@_date: 2013-12-26 08:37:45
Yes sir issue resolved. I reimported the paper wallet a second time and the remaining .26 arrived. Weird... I know. But I got it and moved it around. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:38:17
Thanks for the advice! They finally got back to me, and white listed me! Thanks again :)
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:42:54
I have emailed them. This is the second time I've had trouble buying from them. The first purchase I made was flagged "high risk" - never mind I'm completely verified. I'm just waiting on the end of the 30days before I can buy instantly. Have about another 10 days. 
Ill send them an email asking to speak by phone, I can't imagine that could hurt. 
Thanks for your help :)
@_date: 2013-12-23 06:36:59
Would love for you to share your shop info.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:47:18
Thanks for your help :) 
I'll be sure to post the AI/EPS/PDF of the cards this weekend.

BTC-E never sent my validation email. I can't get a hold of them. Skype, email, the bTcE chat room, etc. 
For all intents and purposes, BTC-E was a bad idea for me. Best of luck. Thankfully I only moved a little bit to exchange for LTC when BTC was up. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:05:33
Removed Info - Issue Resolved - Thank you everyone for your help.
1000000000% positive they didn't arrive.
The address receiving the .26BTC is my paper wallet.
I just imported it into Coinbase to cash out some and all I got was the 1.0BTC that I had in the paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:39:33
Didn't know that. Lol
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:49:31
Maybe including a short blurb about how I'm just a patron looking to spend my money at their establishment?
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:42:27
Thanks for the heads up.
I'm still waiting (3days) for a response regarding my "high risk" BTC purchases...
I bought 1.5btc a week and three days ago, as well as .25 BTC a week ago. Both of my transactions have been canceled due to "high risk" whatever the hell that means.
I should also note, my bank won't acknowledge bitstamp as a recipient of wore transfers. I'm with a major bank, not a credit union, or smaller "neighborhood" bank. Which is why I went with coinbase. They need to fix this.
