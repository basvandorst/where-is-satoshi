Look out! Cross of Coronado is obviously double spending!

Great! Now our virtual currency is worth so much, nobody will exchange it. Great success!

How about we decentralize bitcoin by giving out our private keys to banks? Then we can pay using existing public channels (wire-transfer, credit card).

I'll bet $10,000 that any big bank will survive deleting their IT systems and functioning without one for one year. Any takers?

What is Bitcoin? Currency that allows trusting nobody.
How can you trust nobody? Because you see old transaction output, riddle that allows to spend the output, new transaction input and answer to that riddle. The answer to riddle is script. You can easily prove that answer is correct.
Segregated Witness is proposing to get rid of riddle solutions so we can have "more space for more transactions". What will replace scripts? Well, let me quote:


Which means... I have no idea. I assume it's something like "you can trust miners". And I don't want to trust miner who says "big stack of coins moved to my account, but don't worry, I've already burned all the proofs so they won't take precious space in blockchain".

Telegram is owned by a company and with one button the API key can be invalidated. It will never be a good idea to fix free (as in freedom) tech (e-mail, jabber, bitcoin) with one company.

Upvoted for quick and easy proof of origin.

Instead of signing message with priv key, he needs to do series of complicated actions to prove it? This would be most retarded thing I've ever seen done by "cryptoexpert", but then I tried to copy&amp;paste his quote and...


... and then this "cryptoexpert" secured his website with JavaFuckingScript. Just wow.

Said guy with "cunt" in his name. How appropriate.

I challenge you to read Spiderman comic and not be convinced.
How about we do it properly and use cryptography to prove things? He signed a text with his private key for Gavin, but he never published it. Why?

No, this took 7 months. Back then, Armory ate 2GB of RAM and authors did not care.
