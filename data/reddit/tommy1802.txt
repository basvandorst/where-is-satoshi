Speculation is not Bitcoin's fault. You can also speculate with other things as well. It could be the perfect money for everyone and at the same time be used for speculation. The one does not exclude the other.
I'm more concerned about the transaction fee. Hopefully the Lightning Network tuns Bitcoin back into something that deserves to be called a currency. Namely, to be used to purchase everyday stuff with it without paying more on fees as on the actual product.

Bitcoin, the currency, is the reward system that made its blockchain the most secure in the world. Without the reward, nobody would be really interested in mining, i.e., securing the network. Satoshi really had a nice idea to combine these two worlds with Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-12-06 09:55:50
Yes, that would be a good question. Because, if they own pools, they do not actually own the hash power. A miner can easily switch to amother pool if the current one does anything bad.

Maybe this can be implemented as a changetip service. Namely, that someone can post a tip suggestion with a certain target amount of money and people can add their shares. If the target is reached within a certain period of time -&gt; tip transferred. If not, everyone gets the share back. I think such a tip option could be very interesting and funny. This would be definitely good for Bitcoin since there is an extra advertisement due to the entertainment effect.
So, where are the changetip developers out there?

I like that. Thanks for accepting bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:39:26
You're probably right, but I would not call this a solution to the problem. And anyway, how do I know that a pool operator does not have control over several pools. Only a different name (which can btw also be manipulated) is nothing that I would trust. We, as a community, also need to think about robustness against very powerful attackers like governments or banks able to spend billions of dollars. This would increase the trust in Bitcoin.

You're right and we need to change this! This project is far too important for humanity as a whole.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:20:24
Thx, interesting thought. But as long as the protocol stays the same and as long as there is no efficient distributed pool such that miners get frequent reward based on their mining power brought to the Bitcoin-network, exactly those distributed mini miners are surely devoting their power to a centralized pool. That means, we have solved nothing. I think we need to really find a solution, maybe in the protocol itself that miners directly get as much Bitcoins as they have share in mining power - that would be a solution that would benefit from more decentralization caused by economy of scale. But until we have not solved this issue, nothing would change, since the economic incentive is to strong to work for a centralized pool.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:42:15
With the current protocol there is no way around pools, but maybe we can change that. An obvious goal, which is better for the whole community including the miners, would be if each miner always obtain a reward based on its mining contribution to the network. I'm not sure if this can be incorporated into the protocol. But if we came up with an efficient competitive distributed (and thus no-trust requiring) pool miners would definitely prefer that.
A thought btw.: If we had an absolutely no-trust requiring distributed pool that is not competitive it could still solve the problem if most of the miners would devote their hash-power to that pool. Why? because such a pool could perform selfish mining in a positive way.
Please, before you start shouting. Just think a little about my thought. This would not require a change in the protocol and it does not depend on the efficiency of this distributed pool. If this pool takes over most of the mining power it has the potential to receive all rewards by performing positive selfish mining. All other miners outside that pool also need to change, otherwise they would have no chance of earning anything. It sounds crazy, but as long as such a pool requires no-trust (as Bitcoin itself) everyone would be happy.
@_date: 2014-11-03 12:33:10
I think you do not really get my point here. I will explain it in the future with much more details. I just dont have the time yet. Thx anyway for the discussion.
edit: Hint: I see such a new distributed pool as a potential part of Bitcoin which takes over all the mining. As long as we can trust such a pool we can still trust Bitcoin. Nothing basically changes, it's only like a sub blockchain within the pool (thats how it's made distributed).
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:14:37
I did answer the question: As a first goal I meant "The amount of decentralization should be almost equal to the amount of decentralization of mining hardware power". 
And you are only half right that this decision is for them to make. Currently there is a huge disadvantage for miners to work on their own or a distributed pool, so the decision is strongly biased by the rules set by the current protocol and the lack of alternatives.
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:20:15
Just think about the future, if the Bitcoin price has finally settled at 1 Mio USD per Bitcoin ;-) with almost no fluctuations and nearly the whole world is using it, such a sudden price-drop could have enormous impacts on the global economy (maybe this endangers human lives)
However, I basically think that you are right, that the pool problem will not kill Bitcoin in general, but it reduces trust since this could always happen and nobody knows when. And if we find a solution (by keeping the issue alive) why not implementing it if?
@_date: 2018-05-01 05:23:14
It you want to fund a Bitcoin advertisement, you don't need to ask for permission. It's decentralized, some like it, some not. You will definitely find people in this community that would help to finance this. The problem is more, how to proof that you do not run away with this money. Maybe it should be collected in a milti sig address belonging to some well known and trustworthy people from the community.
@_date: 2014-10-29 05:44:54
yes it is
@_date: 2014-11-03 06:52:48
But if this pool is distributed nothing basically changes. The miners only have the advantage of frequently rewards but mining is still distributed in a P2P pool, right? so nothing changes, its basically the more attractive parameters within the distributed pool that prevent miners from requiring to work for a centralized (untrustful) pool. I dont see the contradiction.
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:03:34
Yeah, but at least I know (or better "strongly believe") that this must be coupled to an extreme investment. Maybe e.g. in quantum computer research or acquisition of mining hardware. Basically, with Bitcoin all trust comes down to the non-invertibility of the SHA256 hash function. I trust this function since it is used in many other crypto-applications as well and a broken SHA256 would have much more impact than only on Bitcoin. But with the pool problem the trust remains on the good behavior of miners which is nothing that I would trust. Especially when someone sees the huge investments made - there are primarily economic incentives - probably from people not interested in Bitcoin at all.

@_date: 2014-11-12 18:51:44
Okay, from what I wrote so far in our discussion, I thought that I have defined the problem already several times. And furthermore In general I did assume that the problem is well known to the community that there is no further need for a definition. You were asking for the amount of decentralization? If you would like to hear a number, I'm sorry, I can't give you that. But I basically think we should distribute everything as much as possible to obtain the biggest amount of trust, namely by having the lowest trust-requirement.
And to define the problem (again): The hash-power-ownership is much more distributed compared to the distribution of the ones having control over huge amounts of this hash-power (centralized pools). A fundamental cause for this problem is the economic incentive of miners to mine for a centralized pool rather than a distributed pool or even alone. And even though currently there seems to be no pool powerful enough to cause any harm to the network, the risk is still much larger compared to a more distributed solution. And furthermore, the chance is much higher that a few powerful entities are attacked and controlled compared to many entities with little power.
Additionally, with centralized pools, how do I know that pool operators do not already work together? I cannot know. But I know for sure, that the chance is much higher compared to a more distributed structure were single entities only have little power.
@_date: 2014-09-04 06:08:04
I think its because the 51% pool problem is not fixed yet. I'm also very restrained in buying new coins until this is fixed.

@_date: 2014-11-03 06:45:58
Why? As far as I know, a distributed pool is again build on a separate sort of blockchain so miners can trust it since there is no centralized party to trust. Maybe you can explain in more detail how a distributed pool works. I think this is important for further discussions. Because I see a distributed pool as something everyone can trust. So why should Bitcoin's credibility go to zero? The mining process is still distributed. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 10:52:12
I've waited for that moment to come. Since Bitstamp changed to Raiffeisenbank it was clear to me that this would cause problems.
Raiffeisen is an Austrian bank that has too much power in the country and has often used that for their own good. They heavily control this country with strong connections to politics.
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:14:47
Thx for the pdf. I will check it out more carfully but so far I found nothing about a potential solution.
@_date: 2014-11-21 05:59:11
You are right, in reality this comparison is much more complicated. You have to find exchanges on both sides consider exchange rates. But as more people adopt to Bitcoin the possibilities increase and rates are similar. Howevrr, in general I think that OP was only talking about the transfer of Bitcoins here and only mentioned the currently equivalent Dollar values.
@_date: 2014-11-02 13:18:26
Can you please explain why nothing changes. I mean, the insentive of pool mining is to frequently get small rewards for the mining power rather than waiting for a long time to maybe earn the huge block reward without pool. A P2P pool exactly solves this problem. Maybe not as efficient as a centralized pool, but if such a pool would perform selfish mining the efficiency does not matter if most miners work for it, since no other pool could ever generate blocks. Why do you think miners still need to join subpools within a P2P pool? Or what did I get wrong here?
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:23:27
Please explain why? But don't tell me that you're a miner and get the best rewards from the biggest pools.
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:29:03
As a first goal for mining, I would say that if someone invests in mining hardware, this person should have full control over the blocks mined with this hardware. A lot of miners give away exactly this kind of distributed power to a pool operator.
@_date: 2016-03-21 11:30:11
Why is mining in big farms more efficient compared to mining at home? Is it because these businesses get special deals for electricity and mining hardware? And if these are the only reasons, why couldn't we join together as a community to also get these deals...only then implemented in a much more decentalized manner?

Bitpay Coinbase are centralizes solutions, this is something totally different. The LN is something that could became the standard way of transfering bitcoins. What I meant is, that if the LN is activated blocks are quite empty because everyone only requires a few transactions the open and close channels instead of all the other transactions inbetween. When blocks are almost empty (at least for a while until wider adoption) the mining fees should again get quite low. Miners take what they can get and if there is this 1MB limit and more transactions waiting, they can pick only the ones with the biggest fee. However, users are not going to pay a huge fee, if the blocks are almost empty. This is why I meant, that miners are afraid of segwit.
I know, Segwit is not required for LN, but it makes it far mor efficient.

@_date: 2017-03-14 05:12:11
I think that we first need to learn how to communicate.The following guy changed my view on how to resolve conflicts totally
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:18:09
Are they failing? We'll know ... The problem I see after POW change is that the network is very insecure ... think about bad actors using the amazon cloud to mine empty blocks for a while. It could take a while until this newly born currency is robust enough ... this initial image of an insecurity could be a benefit for e.g. BU right after a fork.
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:56:53
I think the problem is that at the time there are ASICs around. These ASICs can mine for BU or Bitcoin. When Bitcoin is left behind, these miners can simply damage the old Bitcoin if they want. Why would they do that. I don't know. Maybe to ensure that BU is the only chain left. The only thing we can do to prevent this is to to change the POW. However, then we are a very easy attackable target by powers (e.g. governments) all around the world.
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:02:57

@_date: 2017-03-21 15:13:15
I think this is crazy. You end up with a weakly protected network. Good luck with that. It rather switch to an altcoin or leave the space.
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:21:58
Just thing about the amount the miners will loose when most peoole switch to lightcoin when segwit and LN works there.
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:00:16
Or you
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:29:53
I guess its a matter of definition. Maybe we should call both in a different way after such a big fork ... Feels like people fighting each other like big religions did in the past ... The whole situation reminds me of the old principle of "Divide and Conquer". We are doing Bitcoin no good when we split. Lets seek a compromise instead.
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:45:23
its not about one dude its about a huge fraction of hashpower that could leave after the fork. The rest of us needs to wait until the next difficulty adjustment is coming to get back to almost normal, however, depending on how much miners are left, the network protection is weaker.
@_date: 2016-03-25 12:33:14
Sounds interesting
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:11:34
no there are multi hop transactions in Lightning as far as I understand it
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:08:35
what I meant was that, miners have no incentive to support LN, because they get more fees. With LN, blocks are quite empty and fees go down. The 1MB limit is perfect for miner's profits, because people are forced to pay more and more to get a place within one of the next blocks.
@_date: 2016-03-30 19:11:42
16um is stone age....16nm sounds better
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:29:40
We need to have an option that is supported by the majority ... Maybe we need more options on the table.
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:39:10
This is no compromise. I think miners are afraid of segwit because it makes an efficient LN possible. However .... we can all loose much more .... without the users, Bitcoin is worth nothing. It we really have no other option we, as users, need to leave. This is sad, but this is the only language miners understand .... namely an exreme price crash
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:02:29
This is your opinion. I think we could try to find a solution everybody can live with. 8MB blocks e.g. do not destroy anything. And if a hard fork is necessary, why not do both things at once. I think more miners are likely to follow this path then this fanatic one and one direction only sayers
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:27:29
Why are you so sure?

@_date: 2017-08-25 05:14:33
Thank you, that sounds perfect. I guess when LN gets more and more adopted we will see a singnificant increase in segwit transactions. Hence we can use less space in a block for both reasons, LN and Segwit. Thx
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:06:27
We need more places like that. When people only start to have payment channels to their individual favorite restaurant they are also typically connected to the rest of the world. Such shops and restaurants can play an important role as lightning hubs. The nice thing also is, that you don't have to pay tor lightning fees for the place you visit the most and have a direct channel with.
@_date: 2019-11-27 13:52:52
I cannot tell if this is a good alternative or not but in general I wouldn't do a total change. A new proof of work concept could for example only apply to every second block. Then you do not loose that much of security when introduced.

I agree. However, the tranaction went through.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:29:49
I just recently made a Bitcoin transaction and payed around 17 USD in miner's fee. I had to wait for around 3h to be incorporated into a block. Most transaction within this block had values with several Bitcoins (we don't talk about everyday transactions here). Buying e.g. a pizza with this currency is a very bad idea. Do you guys really see no problem with the the 1MB blocksize???? How long does the lighning network take to be deployed .... and is it even a solution?? We need to fund the channels as well ... these are many more transactions. Me and many friends that are within this community for around 5 years start to get nervous about the future of Bitcoin without some immediate solution. In this sub, everything seems to be alright for everyone as long as the price rises. However, waiting almost 2 hours for a small transaction with 17 USD fee???? We need to do something. I'm not supporting S2X here (since I would like to have core initiating the hardfork), but we need a solution here  very soon, otherwise the 1MB chain gets useless.
Edit: Checked an updated some facts ... I'm sorry for some minor wrong details. It was a 6 inputs to 1 output transaction and took almost 2h ..... 17 USD fee
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:36:36
okay .... maybe you are right .... + fee of course. But that was not my point. Considering the down votes, I feel that there is no space in this sub to mention any serious concerns.
@_date: 2015-07-01 10:28:31
I did. I got a phone call where he asked me if I really want to transfer the money. I said yes. This happened last week and cost me about 50 USD due to the additional delay of about 4 days for buying bitcoins. Yesterday I made another transfer were he told me today that they cannot guarantee that it works this time. They can try it but the chances are much lower because the FMA increased the warning level or something like that.

@_date: 2019-04-18 04:51:26
Yeah, I also had Problems related to a Bitcoin exchange transaction with Raiffeisenbank in Austria some time ago. I just closed my account there. This is the only message they understand.

The newest water heaters could of course have the newest silicon. Maybe you only need to upgrade the heating part. Why not? Nearly everyone needs warm water. And if the electricity costs are already covered by mining ... even better.

I think you did not get me there. I'm with Raiffeisen ... Bitstamp did work together with Raiffeisenbank International, but that was some time ago ... the problem I have is, that my bank (Raiffeisen) does not transfer to money to bistamp's bank, which seems to be a slowenien bank (GORENJSKA BANKA). But you're right, I heard that when bitstamp worked together with Raiffeisenbank International, some people (especially businesses) had problems.
@_date: 2015-07-03 06:35:25
Yes. I told him I can handle that risk and thx for informing me. And thx for delaying my transaction which did cost me around 50 USD because price was increasing at that moment.
@_date: 2016-02-21 19:55:13
Furthermore it is compared to others of the year 2013. Is that fair?
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:15:10
Maybe the NSA is using this Chinese guy to hold back innovation in Bitcoin without revealing their identity.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:35:51
Now it makes sense to me why the US is so interested in the well beeing of their citizens 
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:04:22
Then why they are doing it? The central bank should just stop.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:35:51
Now it makes sense to me why the US is so interested in the well beeing of their citizens

They should sell their oil for Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:23:33
It is just an exchange ratio, nothing special. The big thing is the development of purchasing power over  time .... that really matters. Everything else is just comparing numbers that are just coincidentally a certain fraction of the other.
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:11:26
yeah, this is gentleman.
@_date: 2018-03-24 20:36:39
I enjoy his technical analysis much more than any of this annoying price discussions. Thx Andreas to help me see what really matters for the long run.
@_date: 2015-04-17 05:30:08
I think, as a community we can accelerate this process by organizing crowd funded promotion and bitcoin events. Does anyone know of such projects? I would love to contribute if there would be such a thing in my area, e.g. a crowd funded promotion in a local newspaper.
@_date: 2018-07-04 10:55:28
maybe not 100%
@_date: 2018-07-11 08:38:51
Use Bitcoin in your everyday life and the price will follow .... not the other way round. Help to spread the idea of lightning for example. This is what we need.
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:32:40
Only a question of the supply at that moment. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 11:24:20
And why can't we just store the amount of BTCs in each address and not its entire history. This could reduce the memory requirement also I think. Isn't it enough to store the transactions of the last 1000 blocks and only the final amount from older addresses? Please ELI5 why a concept based o  this idea cannot work?
@_date: 2015-04-27 10:43:12
Wanted to donate but seems to be impossible without entering my personal data. Why isn't there simply a Bitcoin address given? Isn't this exactly one of the advantages of Bitcoin, it's simplicity? No registration.
@_date: 2015-09-09 19:52:18
However, I think there is a big difference between proof of burn and expectation of burn.
@_date: 2015-09-09 17:59:59
What if the holy Satoshi would burn half of his coins, e.g., as a generosity to the whole community? This would be like a donation to everyone holding Bitcoins. How much would the share of each BTC increase?
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:47:57
You are right. Thx. I finally made my donation.
I first thought they need some personal data because of some sort of bitcoin regulation or so.
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:52:04
Yeah. This is so important for Bitcoin. Feels like the early days again. I think most people do not really get it unfortunately. Its difficult to explain to someone who does not understand Bitcoin itself .... Most People are more interested in the price. If they would understand Lightning, they would see that this technology is also very important for the usability of Bitcoin as a currency to be used every day. This fact is also the basis for price increases in the long run. If they could only see that. However, it always starts with enthusiasts .... the others follow .... only this time they can't say that they didn't know .... I think the lightning network will change our understanding what 'early adopter' means. Everyone on r/Bitcoin today can be an early adopter for sure.
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:54:40
It is interesting to me how unimportant Segwit suddenly gets when the price explodes  It seems like most people only wanted Segwit only because of the potential price increase and not because of the ability to tremendously increase the number of transactions per second (through efficient lighting implementations). 
@_date: 2015-10-19 12:56:03
Can someone explain to me why the two clocks (one on the ground, and the other on a plane) are different. I mean how can I see this when explained with this alien space-time slice example. Maybe this is the wrong sub but I'll have a try here.
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:04:26
Yes, there is a name: The Big Short
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:51:51
Force? I thought it was gravity. Gravity is an acceleration.
@_date: 2015-10-04 16:23:27
You can send BTCs to a proof of burn address (this will destroy your coins forever). This is a very simple way to indirectly increase the share of all other BTC users. Sounds crazy, but it's indeed a simple way to somehow donate to all bitcoiners without knowing them.
@_date: 2015-02-14 08:09:51
Never forget. They are using oil. Heard they are selling it to fund weapons. I dont think they are selling it for bitcoin. However, we should really consider banning this oil thing.
@_date: 2015-02-14 08:01:22
I really dought that. But I was always wondering how long it takes until someone makes up this story to harm bitcoin. Now we have it. I will not be surprised if they use this ridiculous argument to declare bitcoin illegal. We have seen similar things before.
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:03:02
At least they can stop merchants to legally accept it, which makes Bitcoin uninteresting for most users.
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:48:38
If the miners make such a fork, the users can always fork to another proof of work concept which renders the huge specialized mining hardware of big miners useless. Problem solved.
@_date: 2015-02-27 05:47:39
How do you know that people actually did the votes and not some million user identity computer algorithm that statistically votes "truth consistent" but for another truth, i.e. the truth they want? 
@_date: 2015-10-19 15:34:23
Oh, okay, I heard of that but thought that the time difference only comes from the motion difference. I mean like in the alien example. Okay thx. I will need to do some more research by myself.
@_date: 2019-05-22 18:22:34
I dont get your last line. Should'nt Bob have 0 and the bank also?
@_date: 2016-07-07 22:00:07
Thanks Sigfried. Maybe I'm coming.
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:01:55
Yes, but not only short term ��
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:35:02
Yeah, I'm afraid that Bitcoin will be remembered as the MySpace of cryptocurrencies some day.
