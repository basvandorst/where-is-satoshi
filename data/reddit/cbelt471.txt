Sounds like a Lamassu plant

It was a live streamed google hangout.  They usually don't get edited.

Unless they didn't purchase the machine and instead only purchased the right to operate the machine and robocoin is still the legal owner of the machine given the contract signed by the operators initially. If this is the case, following your advice will have operators breaching contract.

It's all a bunch of BS from a few pissed off two-bit operators who know only 1 thing about business; complain until you maybe get what you want.

So I wonder what the contract you signed says about this. Contracts are part of the freedom loving world—in fact they are essential to it. The company's "power" over the machines you operate are justified if it states it within the contract you freely and voluntarily signed. Tough tits.

Bad ass. This is awesome.

Do you have anything relevant to the current news cycle to talk about?
@_date: 2015-02-20 20:17:07
Gee I wonder how that whole situation panned out...haven't heard anything since. It's as if the party who was complaining the entire time ended up not having a valid case for complaint...
It's amazing that someone would conduct a little reddit search and instantly believe the opinions of one pissed off keyboard warrior.

There is no database in existence that links people up with scans of their palms, that's why the developers chose it.  They aren't handing it over to anyone, that's not required.  It is simply so they can identify their customers so they can prove due diligence if they were to get questioned as to whether they are obeying the money transmitter laws.

They are considered money transmitter services.  By that distinction they are required to have a "know your customer policy."  Like all  other banks/money transmitter services they have to be able to identify who are making the transactions.  However, without a bank account that is set up using a government form of identification and other personal identifiers, set up in person, Robocoin has to find another way to be compliant with the current laws in the country they are operating in.  It can be turned on and off depending on the specific operator's choice/country's laws.

It's required by federal law to identify each user.  Since you aren't going and opening a bank account in order to use the machine, the operators, as required by law, need to be able to "know their customer."  Depending on the country's laws it can be turned on or off.

It's more than likely an ease of use decision.  You walk up, scan your palm, and you're buying Bitcoin.  Also, if you are in another country and you want to access Robocoin then this will come in "handy"(pardon the pun). Say you live in a country where you don't need to scan your palm.  You then travel to a different country that requires a higher degree of verification, and you want to buy Bitcoin there.  Well, then you need to be a verified user again and establish another profile and wait for it to be verified by an operator.  That would be tiresome and very irritating.
