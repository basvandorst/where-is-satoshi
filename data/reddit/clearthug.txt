@_date: 2017-11-10 19:34:40
and this is why bitconnect works 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:26:10
coinbase is trash
they buy bitcoin and sell it back to u for 3-4% higher
theyre not an exchange either
they are literally flipping coins on you
its like buying shoes from nike.com and reselling them to you for a markup (just because.. what.. they accept credit cards? lol.. just attach ur goddamn bank) when u can just use nike.com / amazon.com etc (some other exchange) and buy it for a better price
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:01:00
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:06:47
and u are?
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:08:02
