I thought they did. I'm glad I read this post now *Off to e-mail them regarding my extra power*
No idea how they are going to give me a chip with 20% power of a Gold Strike. 
I decided this is the last ASIC I am ever buying. I think ASIC are totally screwed up. 
I will never mine the BTC I spent on it after the price rise.... never so now it is late Jan I have even less chance of getting a lot of that back.
Also who are half these companies? What is the quality of their hardware? Etc etc ect.
I will stick with GPU mining which has actually been far more profitable than ASIC mining ever has for me. I need a new card or 5 I get them on a next day delivery and they are going within 24 hours of the order. 
ASIC....... Lucky dip every time.
I'm not sad or bitter about it being late or loosing a lot of coin buying it, That is BTC ASIC mining for you. Just now that you need ASIC it I view it as the dark seedy side of BTC and a long way away from what it was supposed to be.
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:43:32
When it comes to mining I am not a fan of ASIC. 
I don't like the preorder scene, I think a lot of the time the value of the coin can go up and you will never make back your investment.
Also it does take a lot of people out the mining market and raises the entry bar to a point where casual miners can't get in.
Not sure how I feel about Scrypt ASIC and will be interesting to see what these 'ASIC proof' coins (Looking at you Litecoin) do about it. I'm guessing nothing and these ASIC proof statements will vanish.
I think a distributed currency should at least allow distributed mining.
Feel free to wade in and stick up for ASIC
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:41:43
Both valid points in a way.
It would be nice to see the community step up. It's good for BTC, it's good for their future business etc.
Also the comments are true too. It is a decentralised currency and you take your chances. At the same time not a currency you can really expect the common man/woman to get behind.
It would make a far bigger story these big BTC corporations taking over Gox and paying back to the users. It may make for a better story in the press and help to move on from Gox quicker.
With nobody saying anything, nobody doing anything this is going to drag on for a very long time. 
Lets see how the next few days go. The first thing that would be nice is a response from a legally registered business in Japan as to why they closed the doors and what happens next! 
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:27:27
Jesus. I hate to say it but someone is really going to end up hurting Mark for this.
That is not right but if you keep slapping even a timid person in the face they are going to snap eventually.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:42:47
As it should.
The key issue in the BTC world right now is Gox. Website is down, Support is dead. Clearly the company is finished but is it bankrupted, sold to someone else. What.
More pressing. What about customers funds. How do they get at whatever is left etc.
This story should be the only thing people care about right now. Bitcoin will never move on until all the questions have been answered. Starting with Gox's or their liquidators response. 
Gox was the most known in the media, lets just get it out there, take the hits and get the truth. Then we can move on. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 11:45:30
People have lost confidence that their money on Gox is actually still there. Maybe they are cashing out to USD in the hope it would be easier to get post Gox meltdown. 
If Gox do start withdrawals then I expect the Gox price to shoot up pretty quickly again as the USD folk buy back in to BTC.
Considering Gox had the problem first Bitstamp are opening up the doors again.... Another epic fail for Gox.
Serious run on the exchange is coming up if they do start again. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:33:27
I would agree with this to an extend but looks like your getting the downvotes.
Over a week now and no BTC out of those exchanges. Bitstamp are still down and the media is all over it. The longer it goes on the more it seems like a long term issue rather than a short term one and I think that is the key here to the growing uncertainty and lack of confidence.
This reddit is still full of upvoted positive BTC stories, Coindesk still looks very positive full of nice stories when BTC is creaking at the seams. Really not much info coming out of the two exchanges yet people act as life goes on.
Anyway it is a huge problem, the prices are reflecting this. The longer it goes on the further down the price goes. It will go the other way when the exchanges open again (Maybe not for Gox who are clearly going to have a run on their hands) but this one will be felt for a while, Especially 2014 - The year of BTC!
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:56:26
Mark must really be feeing the pressure to have an interview of any kind. 
I'm glad we got some information out the guy. It may not be much but at least in some small way he has spoken out. 
The longer the exchanges stay down the worse it will be and the longer this issue is felt. I was really looking forward to 2014 abd Bitcoin but I think people will be a lot more cautious during this year.
Maybe this is reflected in the price drops we are seeing now as people step back for a bit.
Anyway well done Mark for the interview.... Now when are you going to fall on your own sword so Mt Gox might have a very small chance of one day being a decent exchange again!
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:09:17
That's the one

Seriously I'm even more mad now. I thought I was just getting fobbed off but in fact they have a near copy and paste response ready for people who complain or query.
It makes me mad that these sharks can call themselves the Bitcoin Foundation in the first place.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:03:15
Yeah they stopped them too. I guess they will restart soon and who knows about Gox.
Not what we wanted for 2014 but lets see what happens once it is behind us.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:26:51
This is a BTC Reddit matey. None of this DOGE rubbish here!
So BTC, No DOGE, Such Whoops!
Yup, Hold the door for me buddie.
@_date: 2014-01-23 10:46:48
3 exchanges actually. 
I use BTC-E for trading ALTS. 
Bitstamp but it was too new for me and I felt uncomfortable using it at the time.
Gox - used before, I guess before they got far too big. Verification took 3 days and traded in and out fine. I changed phones and never changed GA so I just created a new account.
I never googled GOX Problems or WTF GOX before putting my coin in however. I had actually had a very good experience with them in the past. I'm sure once my account is verified in 2015 I would easily take BTC in and out no problem.... Except now I know what their customer services are like I would never touch them again.
Hindsight says to use BTC-E or Bitstamp but previous never had any problems with GOX.... but then never needed support! 
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:57:10
I like Dogecoin to be honest and I think as a coin it is far better than Litecoin. Forget everything else that surrounds it. It's fast, your not stuck with diff that takes far too long to come back down and there are a lot of coins to go around.
As a Scrypt coin I like it. Devs are also pretty active in the community.
If it will survive who knows. If it will indeed 'Go to the moon' who knows. Either way I think it will sink or swim before ASIC become an issue for them. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 10:29:48
Well another person now who agrees about them being a joke.
I just hope they pull their finger out eventually so I can withdraw my coins and exchange them somewhere else when the time comes.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:53:01
Um... Is this sarcastic or have you been under a rock for a week :-P
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:54:57
Personally I think Gox are probably with their Lawyers all day today getting prepped on how to respond properly to the public, media, regulators etc.
I say regulators not for BTC but they are operating as a legal business in Japan handling real money. They may be looking at fraud charges etc. 
I know nothing about the situation but this is just my thought. That document put a firework under Marks A$$ and he is bouncing between trying to find a buyer and a lawyers to cover his ass. 
Either way is he wants to stay out of prison as the CEO, MT Gox will need to respond.
@_date: 2014-02-14 12:57:49
Epic &amp; True
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:08:57
I think that sums it up really. Someone somewhere is actively switching everything off.
@_date: 2014-02-14 12:59:27
I got one when I logged into Gox. 
Weird as it seems to be a new thing. Never got this before. Annoying too as should the people who just implemented this not be working on something else?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:48:51
I think it sounds like a bunch of BS with the user at the bottom of the food chain. 
How does shutting us out of our accounts protect us? We can't withdraw anything, fine shut down trades but what harm comes of letting us log in.
Then as well why delete your helpdesk?
I don't see how any of this protects 'the user'
I call BS here though I would love to think there is a chance I will get my funds back I don't see it
@_date: 2014-02-19 10:45:34

Errrrr..... I never bought into Doge sir, I don't know how that got on my record! *nervous*
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:43:33
I have to go with DOGE on this too. I'm not for one more than the other but it has got some traction going. Devs seem to be pretty active and a large community following.
Reminds me of the early days of BTC before it suddenly got serious. 
Anyway competition is good. I know everyone would love for everyone else to stick with BTC to push the price up more but competition with different algorithms is good for everyone.
Anyway DOGE has some traction is the short answer and a lot of what is said about Doge was also said about BTC a couple of years back.
What happens going forward who knows.
@_date: 2014-02-12 10:25:28
That was one of my thoughts too. Can't see there new customer verification queue being very big now. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:34:25
I think there have been a few reports of Bitcoin fraudsters being arrested.
Even if governments don't want to see BTC as currency they would act when a company has stolen customers assets.
If Gox plays dirty or stalls too long someone is going to start looking. Also remember there are some big fish in Gox with a lot of money tied up. I'm sure they can afford lawyers. 
I don't think you can do anything to them about the price but I do think you can do something if they steal your coins or stall indefinitely. 
I guess we see what tomorrow holds. 
Lets just say however when they do start withdrawals again no way will they just open the flood gates. They will come up with some waco way of trying to win back confidence so there is not a run. I expect them to be processing 'manually' or some crap for weeks/months slowing the flood.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:57:15
Your asking this in a BTC Reddit???
Probably better asking in the Dogecoin Reddit. More chance of making it happen there.
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:42:25
Who said it was 'your' problem. 
Like it or not Gox is a huge name in Bitcoin. Media grab on to it, everyone talks about it and like it or not there is a lot of Bitcoin inside of that exchange.
It affects everyone. Not 'your' problem buddie but if you hold Bitcoin it does affect you and will affect you until the coins make it out or the company folds.

I'm on the december list which ideally meant I would have it in December. I agree with the point that they said they would ship on time. 
Did they not say something about giving you extra hashing power if they were late by x amount? I barley remember that when I purchased it way back.
Just checked their website and cant see anything like this on it.
@_date: 2014-02-14 11:52:10
I think I posted in one of these Scotcoin ones before.
We are currently arguing about what currency we will keep if we go independent. Scotcoin is not one of those and never will be.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:01:58
Good spot! So it looks like they were planning to sell off to someone else or still are planning considering we have had no announcement either way yet

Now how do we know you have not changed his QR code for your own before I go tipping him :-P
@_date: 2014-01-23 10:42:15
I don't ever intend to try and take USD out of Gox. Once they verify my account in 2015 I will be taking my BTC and closing my GOX account.
I will actually go through the effort of closing it rather than just forgetting about it. Yes another waste of time but probably much more satisfying :-P
@_date: 2014-01-23 09:53:49
Longest running BTC exchange that I know of, also the one used in most press stories. It was the top used one until China came along....
No money was thrown blindly but looks like your out to set the tone of this post.... Maybe your post should have said, 
'Did you research exchanges before you placed money in Gox?'
Now does that not sound better to you?
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:50:31
I downvoted you. Why? Because nobody knows yet what the condition is inside Gox. Your just spreading even more rubbish around. 
They company sucks, We all know that but what exactly is going on nobody outside knows for sure. 
Lets wait for the announcement and see what happens or does not happen next.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:23:36
I'm Scottish too and let me say.... What a pile of shite!
Now I'm never normally that rude so I apologise but there is simply no other way to put it.
Another coin offering nothing and giving it away to everyone makes it just as worthless. That 2 Billion kept in reserve is what the Dev is counting on not the 98 Billion getting handed out.
Scotlands biggest issue this year is between the Pound &amp; Euro not Scotcoin. Get behing BTC, LTC or DOGE and forget this one.
Now back to my Irn Bru &amp; Haggis*
*Not keen on Irn Bru and I'm a vegetarian
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:53:57
P.S. I'm upvoting you because I laughed. I think Bitstamp mocked Gox and then realised they had the same issue so halted them too.
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:38:07
All valid points to be fair. 
I don't know which way it will go but I agree most people are hoarding their stash and only spending a very small amount of it.
Then if it does exist as a speculative investment vehicle rather than a currency that is still not a bad thing either. I do think it has a place but for the common person right now no way!
Could you imagine the amount of people who would get their Bitcoins stolen from their laptops and never have a clue why (Screensaver.exe to be oldschool). Do they keep it with Coinbase or some other unregulated online wallet? We see how great 3rd party services have been this week.
It is a very new, very rough technology that is making waves as for investors. Most companies 'accepting BTC' just get the Fiat back from the processors.
This is all my personal opinion. I believe Bitcoin is here to stay, I think price wise it will go up but we have a long way to go with it yet.

Sounds like he is just stringing people along. I can't see folks getting their money back. Just delay tactics whilst he figures out what to do.
Some update mate!
@_date: 2014-01-25 21:19:08
I was one of the people who complained yesterday.
It is a joke and the support sucks. 1-2 weeks between support e-mails.
Started the verification process Nov 10th and still nothing.
I actually wonder why it is so slow considering the amount of people now using other exchanged. I also wonder if they will verify me or just stop trading one day and keep my coins.
Very worrying company and I really want verified soon so I can pull all the coins and happily take another 3 months closing down my account.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:29:34
How it should be.
@_date: 2014-02-12 09:12:50
I don't know.
I think the reason behind Gox stopping withdrawals is genuine and with Bitstamp doing the same it adds weight to this.
It does not however excuse them for the crappy customer services, 3.5 months of waiting to be verified and lack of clear response on any issues.
I think they may reopen, I even believe the money might be there when it does. They have a lot of work to do and it is going to take them years to even gain a slither of trust from the community. 
Mark should have stepped down already from the company and from the joke that is the foundation. A clear statement should have been given and constant updates on progress etc. It is called damage control and they have done zero. 
Oh well. Lets wait and see. For now I was quite surprised getting an e-mail from Danny saying my account was now verified. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 20:52:37
Actually Jan batch here. Order 966.
I still plan to quiz them on that 20% if it has not gone by January.
I'm pretty convinced it said December when I purchased it.

@_date: 2014-02-20 11:02:31
I'm glad they still have it on their page however. 
A lot of BTC is tied up there. It should not simply be ignored and the price is still relevant to BTC until they money is released or the company folds. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:34:09
Burying your head in the sand does not work I'm afraid. 
A lot of people &amp; early adopters have a lot of money held in Gox. It is the most important story around BTC now and this past couple of weeks.
Where are the coins, where will they end up. If they get deleted how will that affect what remains etc etc etc. 
Until this is resolved I'm sorry but it is the most important thing concerning BTC. 
Sweeping it under the carpet and all the people it has affected is not what needs to happen. Pressure from everyone in the BTC community needs to be focused on Gox. Press, BTC companies, Big BTC personalities. Everything and everyone needs to be looking at them until this ends one way or another.
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:47:53
Uhhhhh, It takes Gox a long time to do anything let alone do a complex change such as this. They also will need to make sure there books are all in order..... Either that is just not going to happen or it is going to take them even longer to do than fixing the bug.
Either way expect delays and no quick fix.
Hell people are going to leave it large numbers if they do open shop again and I can't see them getting many new customers anytime soon. Right now they have locked everyone in and still claiming trading fee's. Seriously, its the only gig they have left so might as well drag it out and scoop up those fee's.
I have a decent amount of BTC on Gox. I would love to see it back and honestly I do believe they have the coins and they will open shop again. I don't see it being for a while and support still will ignore anything you ask them. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:49:06
I think they meant a fund to give BTC back to the people that lost it and not help save Gox.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:23:44
Mt Who?
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:31:56
Also curious how exactly people are getting in touch with these staff members. 
There is no helpdesk or support system any more. If your staff want to hang around chat rooms well I guess that is their problem if they get hounded.
