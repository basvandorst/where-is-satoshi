Same here 
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:11:07
Same thing when BTC was 2300 euro and I told people that 1000 euro was coming (when they hit moon and other bullshit). So the 1000 euro price is near.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:02:25
Bitcoin can be replaced by another better coin. Only thing keeping Bitcoin on top is being the first cryptocoin.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:16:24
You pay taxes on selling Bitcoins??? You are defenetly doing it wrong......
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:55:54
I know already what i will say. Told you so :D. But will buy at cheap price and that is also for sure.
@_date: 2017-07-14 22:12:20
We will see in 15 days what happens to the price..
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:52:31
And does people :
1. Already sold it
2. Lost it
3. Are dead
4 HODL (no way).
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:30:22
I will also buy at the price range of 1000$. I am just saying don't be hodl on a sinking ship and buy when the ship goes up.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:59:14
There will be two chains... It all depends on miners if both chains work or not (ETH original and classic).
@_date: 2017-07-15 12:40:34
But no one knows about the bot. That is why the price already hit 1771 euro.. Sell while you can and buy cheap BTC at 1000 euro.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:28:03
Go and try to live only on BTC for a week (all your expenses covered by BTC). The talk about fist currency.
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:11:41
Fist should not rise.. Fist goes down and that is normal (you can buy 1 bread for 1$ today and in 5-10 years 1 bread will cost 2-3$ and that is normal). BTC can go bust any time (you can check how many cryptocoin were made and how many are already gone). 
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:13:07
And if there is no gain at all in the future?
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:37:57
And if the price goes to 1000EURO (around 1100$) ?
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:38:49
So you can't go on vacation to Europe, sell your coins anonymously and travel back to USA????? It will be cheaper (you will get on vacation also) the paying the tax......
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:09:50
It mean I have see it all (good parts and bad). The price is going down and that is good (we got to 2400 euro too fast). After the crash the price will rise again and this time I hope it will be steady rise and not skyrocket moons bullshit.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:09:16
Nope... So you pay uncle Sam when you win and when you start to lose money what happens?????
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:46:17
14 more days. Here come the sale orders 
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:54:30
It's pretty possible after fork the price can hit 300$ for some time.
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:16:16
Replace the first two word (fiat money) whit Bitcoin  and guess what? It's the same. What is Bitcoin backed by??
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:26:47
Good for you. You can light your cigarette whit 100$ bill as well.. Does that mean you should do it?
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:22:58
Doing simple  math and looking at your screenshot it goes to -23k EUR (if there was no editing involved in the screenshot).... Did the rest 57k you burned were monopoly?
@_date: 2017-07-14 22:07:52
That is the wallet whit the remaining 288 ltc.....
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:53:32
But I like copy pasta...
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:42:10
The price of BTC shouldn't reach 1000$ in the GOX days (it was all pumped by there BOT). That is the main reason we stayed around 200-300EURO for so long (and that is pulling the BTC down).
Every time (check for yourself if you don`t believe me) when big exchange goes bust , the price drops by 10-20%. 
Combine 1/2/3 and you get 1000 EURO in the next two months.
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:41:29
And there goes 1680...
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:06:47
That you lose 80k in monopoly money...
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:37:29
In the future =5 or more years. I am for Bitcoin (i have some BTC and wallet from the days BTC was 10$ and never sold them) holder, but at the same time i am realist and see what is going on the market.
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:18:26
It will reach at that rate because they will make new things for it or Bitcoin will burn and there will be new king on the market.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:56:12
The rocket is already sold for spare parts. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:05:23
Sell them now. Buy them back in less then Two weeks... I can't understand why people don't see that easy money....
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:41:07
Make that 1680...
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:50:56
I don`t mind and probably will buy more BTC if the price hit 1000 EURO (by the end of the year top). Like i say i belive it will reach 10k in 5 years but at the moment the price is highly pumped.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:15:11
Since when warning people about loosing money (talking true so far and in the future we see.....) is talking shit?? You mad that you  didn't sell? Sell at 1680 while you can.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:08:05
Yes. Talk to you in two weeks.  Just hope it doesn't go below 1000$, because then it will hit 400$ again..
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:26:36
Can't answer my simple question.. What is Bitcoin backed by???? Fiat is backed by country. Bitcoin Is backed by?????
What physical commodity is Bitcoin backed by?
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:17:10
In that case why do people think Bitcoin is going down???? Because they COMPARE IT WITH REAL MONEY (FIAT)..... 
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:59:23




Already sold big chunks of my LTC when the price started going down.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:30:24
Same comment was whit ETH and see what happens...
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:20:28
I am pretty happy whit my life. Are you mad you didn't listen to people and begin to loose money fast? Don't worry hodl for 5 years and you will still be in profit.....
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:33:45
The low price is enouth for me to buy at 1000$. I belive in BTC (and belive that some other coin can be the new king and replace BTC in the years to come) and in cryptocurency.
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:40:04
And the price goes down to 1680 euro... 
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:55:30
A lot of exchanges are blocking Bitcoin withdraw.. A lot more will also do it In the coming days.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:12:19
So you are calling him a rat? I totally agree whit you. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:19:53
You buy and then you cry...
@_date: 2017-07-14 23:18:35
Have a nice day to you also. Buy at this price 1900 euro and cry later.
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:51:52
Pretty simple. Its confirmed that BTC price was never real 1000$ is just bot trading by the owner of GOX and the price was artificial pumped. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:18:13
I just want to understand why you pay taxes at all on something you take risk on????
If you go to casino and win, do you pay taxes too??
P.s. I am not located in USA 
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:14:48
And 7 days later you will buy at 1100$ (1000 EUR)...
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:18:46
Almost all coins are better then BTC and have more options and benefits. Only because BTC was first is what keeps it in the buble.. 1000 euro is the top price for BTC for at least 5 years.
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:17:39
You get nothing. USA will auction this coins and take the profit...
@_date: 2017-07-12 08:47:07
Always encrypt your wallet with strong password.
Always have backup of your wallet in different devices.
If you plan to invest in Bitcoin, invest only the money you can afford to lose (think of it as gambling).
Avoid Using Online Wallets.
Keep your fortune in "cold storage" if you plan to wait for better prices.
Never use the same password for mails,exchanges or mining pools.
Never keep your coins in exchange.
Never keep all your coins in single wallet.
Don`t use your wallet on every day computer/laptop.
When using an online service such as an bitcoin exchange: Enable 2-Factor-Authentication (like Google authentication) on your account!
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:00:26
And you ride your unicorn to work right?
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:21:00
Sorry but USA laws are stupid.... 
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:26:33
So you expected crash but tell me I an talking shit when I say crash to 1000 euro is a good price (it can go lower then that)???? 15 more days until price hit 1000 EUR.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:32:38
Just gi cry about your lost money and hodl for another 5 years... I am enjoying hodl tears when they start selling (and lose money because the price goes up in 5 years)....
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:00:03
Sell before you lose another 12k. when the price hit 1100$.
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:35:08
I am here. On this i am sure it will happen. The price is going down and it going down hard to 1000 EURO and that is the normal price for  BTC at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:46:50
Whit ETH was ok(almost). But whit BTC it will be doomsday. One of the chain will be whit better price the the other. Until we know what will be the best chain, the price can drop to even 400$...... So sell now (1680 EUR) and buy back on both chain the same coin for 500-600 euro top....
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:48:20
Check the whois info on my site. Like i say i am back from the days when 10$ for a btc was a normal price (can give my btc adress if you want to check it). Its not FUD. Its the hard true. BTC price at the moment is totally pumped... I hold at the moment around 280 LTC, 10 BTC, 20 000 XRP, 10 ZEC, 20 ETH and some other coins that doesn't even exist at the moment (CANN, HIRO and more).
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:47:56
How come ?!?!? USA will take the Bitcoins and sell them.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:58:06
It was almost 2400 euro... Look at the price now (less then one month and it keeps going down). By the end of the month it will hit 1000 euro and that is for sure.
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:39:28
And i hope unicorns are real.
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:48:11
Can you tell me what part of this is not correct?? You educate me what Fiat is. I will educate you what Bitcoin is....
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:54:28
Its also possible that unicorns exist and fairy too... Split = insecure and bad price for both BTC chains..
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:36:27
You  say Bitcoin beats Fiat..  When you can live your everyday life on bitcoins the it outperforms Fiat currency. For now it's like stock options... You can't live on it and hope the price goes up (so you can sell for same old paper money)...
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:39:33
Sell again before it hits 1000 euro 
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:22:36
320 Bitcoin to be precise (according to his lost). Yes I think less then 20% of people here have more then 100 BTC..
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:34:40
You will buy at that price in 2-3 months top.
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:06:25
Check you  4 and 3?? I bet that less fiat currency go bust then there are cryptocurency going bust for 6 years....... So you compare currency like in Zimbabwe that goes bust, but when 100 cryptocurency disappear in less then 5 Years  that is somehow different and fiat goes more bust....
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:37:32
Here's some learning for ya.
What is 'Bitcoin '
Bitcoin is currency that is not backed by a physical commodity or country. The value of Bitcoin is derived from the relationship between supply and demand rather than the value of the material that the money is made of (Bitcoin has no physical material and you can use Fiat money to make fire).Historically, most currencies were based on physical commodities such as gold or silver, but Bitcoin is based solely on the faith and credit of the economy (so we see price from 1 cent to 2400 euro in 5-6 years.. 
Tell me what part of this is wrong?
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:27:13
It's also loosing... Too much drama around  BTC. Time to switch to another coin.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:11:12
I really hope he does not do it... Walking dead is good only for TV.
@_date: 2017-07-15 12:39:13
Why. The price already goes down to 1771 euro. We still have 16 more days for price to fall down. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:57:56
Miners profit from less transaction in a block. Basically you are saying "Go for smaller payment and continue mining"... 
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:35:05
He can pay and fake his death...
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:13:32
Simple put it in this way. What does uncle Sam do for you  if you pay 10k in taxes (some random number) and after 6 months you  lose 100k because crypto goes down????
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:40:11
