Bitcoin-related art or art for sale for bitcoin? I have some cryptoart concepts i'm working on, would like to connect with others in the same boat.

I like it. I don't claim to have fully understood it yet, but i think it's a clever solution to a problem everyone wants to solve. I'm unsure of the feature overlap/discrepancy between this, mastercoin, and bitshares, but it will be interesting to see how each finds it's niche (or doesn't).

Well I feel real bad for anyone with money trapped in gox now... Not that this wasn't expected. But I also feel damn good about picking up some cheap coins.

The colored coin approach seems like it could work at a conceptual level - it might just be a matter of which path gets more fully developed in the shortest time

I work right around the corner from the farmers market - i could throw a rock from my office window and hit their front door. I'll stop by in the next week and chat 'em up about it as well.

No, but it doesnt matter. It's not like Paypal will be the only bitcoin-accepting entity, it's just a matter of market adoption, and like them or not (I don't) Paypal is a big player in the market, and would open up a ton of opportunity for bitcoin users.

as far as i understand it, which is admittedly only on a surface level, alternate blockchains could be developed which would allow for a form of escrow through, for instance, a zerocoin or colored coin implementation. I'm not 100% clear on the details of those approaches, but in the case of zerocoin, the coins sort of "disappear" from the blockchain and then reappear at a later time (on a signal from the buyer). the whole deal could be arbitrated before that signal was sent, and the wallet address(es) where those coins "reappear" could be with the seller, the buyer, or some split. Again, very surface understanding of this, but the gist is that escrow could conceivably be built into the/a blockchain.

Unless he had encrypted his wallet using bitcoin-qt, which is what you should do if you value your coins... an unencrypted wallet.dat is pretty fucking easy to steal. And no, it's not shocking he was able to access them - it's expected, by design.

It doesn't make sense if they're dealing with a deflationary currency, especially one that is frankly difficult to acquire for Joe q public. It makes sense for them to think they should charge a commission but it makes zero sense for a consumer (non-miner) to use them to pay bills.

well i THINK that zerocoin could handle the escrow part, but you're right, there would have to be a trusted layer of mediation that would determine when and where the zerocoins "reappear". The actual escrow would be decentralized, the coins simply wouldn't exist while they were in escrow, and the mediation layer would have to be the trusted party. Understood that this is all theoretical, but its just an example of one way these issues could be resolved.
@_date: 2013-08-07 04:02:04
But... it's a deflationary food!

You're probably right, there is a void where SR used to be but within a month I'd expect everything to be biz as usual. But something HAS changed with regards to bitcoin and drugs - the public perception. Doesn't matter if the black markets are really gone, what's important is that people THINK they're gone. I don't have to tell anyone in this subreddit that plenty of USD black markets exist, and they don't shake confidence in the dollar, but SR definitely was a perceptual hurdle to mainstream BTC acceptance.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:42:15

Glad to see some of the e-cig folks are starting to get on the BTC train.

Best thing to happen to the bitcoin community in a long time, if not ever. Silk road was great to build the economy, in the same way that the porn industry pushed VHS to a critical mass, but I think yesterday's limited price movement shows exactly how much of the market was really driven by that one service. The drug stigma was the biggest perception challenge to Joe Six-pack getting into BTC, the technical challenges still exist but those are easier than public perception to fix.

has all the awesome details on how bitcointip bot works -its pretty nifty
@_date: 2013-06-26 13:35:39
Sure, a possibility. But if theyre trying to start a successful business, bitcoin speculators who for some reason want to sell now is a pretty small market segment to target...
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:35:20
Ah yes, forgot about that - i stand corrected.

I had ~7btc that I had JUST transferred them into the wallet minutes before the server went down, and was about to transfer them out when the shit hit the fan. July 1 is their stated date to start fulfilling claims, so nobody will likely hear anything till then.
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:53:30
Yeah I agree, thats a more subtle and nuanced way of saying what i was getting at. Well put.

There's more coming your way from my direction, but for the moment I figured might as well make it rain btc dust all over y'alls Outpost.
