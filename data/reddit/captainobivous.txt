I'm saying it does not matter and is trivial.

Chill out.  The total amount of fake bills is about 1.5 million euros.  That's hardly cause to go all caps and start banging out exclamation marks in your frickin post title like a retard.  WTF is wrong with you.

OK, so the price is back to what it was seven days ago.  Not sure why  it matters if it was because of terror, regulations, or that I scratched my sack, it's a short-term, minor fluctuation.

Stop dissing orgasmic pleasure.  You say that like it's a bad thing.   Normal people don't voluntarily do things they don't find pleasure in doing.  
If editors did not derive pleasure from the process, there would be NO editors and NO Wikipedia.

It went up about 2%.  Hardly dramatic.    It also did that on the 11th. 
It is probably a simple correction.  Price has been falling recently.  It was higher five days ago.

Transactions don't get validated until the difficulty is automatically adjusted downward.  Not a good situation.

If it costs $3800 worth of electricity to mine bitcoin worth $3500, why would they do that?  If they want to become hodlers "in the hope of a recovery" why would they not just buy the bitcoin instead of spending their cash on electricity at a loss?

Have you decided what color your Lambo is going to be yet?

 For that matter, buying bitcoin is not "investing", it's "speculation "
