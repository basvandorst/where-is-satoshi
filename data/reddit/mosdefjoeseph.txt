Long-run, BTC is deflationary since there is a finite amount of it.

Gravity is a theory. Everything is a theory. Economists use the scientific method too, it just so happens that studying the cumulative affects of 6 billion people is not as straightforward as studying the mass of a neutrino. 
I highly suggest you cure yourself of your ignorance. Start with Freakonomics. If you’re intelligent enough to understand gravitational waves, I’m sure you’ll be able to understand economics.

Jesus, we really need to start teaching economics again. How on earth could anyone actually believe an asset’s value could become infinite. 
Unbelievable how many otherwise smart people on reddit have absolutely no idea how markets work at all.

Decentralized means no single entity (like a federal reserve bank) is “in charge of” the currency, and therefore no single entity can alter its supply, nor is any singe entity responsible for the ledger.

I didn’t say easy, I said straightforward, but a better word would have probably been “experimentally controllable”.

That’s 4-Chan. Why not just go there?
Furthermore, there are other bitcoin subreddits that allow a wider variety of content. 
Also, Bitcoin is decentralized, but it still has rules (albeit mathematical ones) or else it couldn’t exist. There’s a big difference between decentralization and anarchy.

Right.  I mean, 1 in 5 Americans aren’t even in college right now so how could that even be possible?

There actually is something we can do. 
We can stop parroting the misleading, sensationalist clickbait headlines based on specious reasoning that lacks any understanding of how the technology actually works.

Because it associates Cryptocurrency with child pornography basically using logic that could literally be used to associate anything with child pornography.
“Pedophiles drive vans therefore we should ban vans”
Like vans, Blockchain is a tool. Every tool could be used by pedophiles but that doesn’t mean we throw out all our tools.

The key reason cryptocurrencies have the value they do is precisely because they lack the traits of sovereign currencies, not in spite of it. 
Also, If these elite traders own so much of it, why would they want to intentionally hold back its long-term value by engaging in short-sighted market manipulation?
It would be in their best interest to do everything they can to increase acceptance and adoption to accelerate demand, not cripple its growth for a quick buck.

Economics is NOT a religion. It’s a hard science with mathematically proven theories about how markets work. I highly suggest studying the subject more if you’re really that ignorant about it. 
I love physics too, though, and think it’s a shame that half of Twitter is apparently dumb enough to think the world might be flat. We seriously need to fix our education system.

Miners get the same amount of BTC, regardless of its USD value at the time, so wouldn’t they prefer BTC always have a higher value?
@_date: 2018-03-25 10:11:35
I think the one thing all these posts blaming [X] for crypto being down (or up) have two things in common; they’re all correct to the extent that each of these theories probably factor into the overall average prices, but they’re also all incredibly near-sighted in that they assume there is usually only one reason for price movement, when in reality there are usually hundreds.

Mohammad Yunus, who won a Nobel Prize for identifying the market forces behind starvation, pioneered micro finance in the 3rd world with provably positive results, and made the economic argument for a global, decentralized currency decades before bitcoin.

But if you’re a miner, you already have mining hardware, plus the equipment used by miners is also used for many other things, so miners don’t control the price of hardware either, they just influence it short-term.

By this logic, actual gold would be worth about $10/ounce.

A self driving car killed a pedestrian the other day. Self driving cars are still astronomically safer than human drivers, but that’s not as easy to sensationalize on the nightly news. 
This is just the media scaring the rubes like they always do. Anyone who sells because of this story should have never invested in the first place because they clearly don’t understand how bitcoin actually works.

Will do. I’m literally sitting down and writing my first draft right now so hopefully I’ll have something to send in a few hours.

I’m a huge Blockchain supporter, and over 90% of my portfolio is in crypto, but when I look to buy stocks I am trying to diversify and protect my exposure a bit, not reinvest in something already pegged to the other 90% of my portfolio.

I remember when charts were something people could look at rather than watch.

I’m actually writing a series of Blogs called “Explain it to Dad” and the first article is about Bitcoin. Let me know if you would want to proofread what I have before I publish.

Simply put, it’s an asset.

And as long as the overall market cap of the crypto economy as a whole continues to increase, so will the value of bitcoin.

It would be hard to prove that facts were materially misrepresented. Just because some people didn’t read the fine print, doesn’t mean they were technically lied to from a legal perspective. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:24:57
Nobody is pushing the value higher. The market is doing a fine job of that on its own. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 08:31:14
Why do you think that’s the case?
@_date: 2018-04-24 08:43:39
That would also be the case if Bitcoin was rising organically, so what leads you to believe the recent price movement is the result of manipulation rather than natural market growth?
@_date: 2018-04-29 09:24:28
It’s a good thing. The pie is growing.

I don’t like him either, but what crime would you charge him with that carries a prison sentence?
@_date: 2018-04-29 05:45:30
That would have to be civil court, where there’s no possibility of jail time.

Terrorists were already using crypto, and have been violating halal as long as they’ve been terrorists, so...?
