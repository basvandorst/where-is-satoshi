Actually I think this survey, assuming accurate, is actually showing data which illuminates bitcoin in a *positive light*.
* 76% of surveyed are not familiar with bitcoin. **That means 24% of the people have heard of bitcoin!** If 24% of the people in america have heard of bitcoin already to the point where they remember it, I'm impressed. Ask around. I doubt the general public know what bitcoin is, if you're telling me 24/100 strangers are familiar, I'm impressed. Also the survey was done in late January, 2014. It is now May 2014, which makes 24% back then more impressive.
* 79% wouldn't use it as an alternate currency. That means 21% would! If we were to point out what most people do with survey data, it'd read, *"Over 1 in 5 people already consider using bitcoin as an alternative currency!"*
* Since only 24% of the people have heard of it, and 21% would use it, that actually means **87.5% of the people who were exposed to bitcoin would use it as an alternate currency!**
* And already 38% believe it will hurt the US Dollar, given the stage it is in, and people's heavy reliance on the USD. This is again, huge. **Bitcoin only has 24% exposure, and already 38% believe it's a threat!**
* 80% would rather own gold... but 76% are not familiar with bitcoin! So only 4% of those surveyed actually prefer gold, since those not familiar shouldn't count.

There's nothing stopping people from doing that, however mtgox has heavy delays on withdrawals currently. If you're okay with that, you could be making some money, yes.
Technically though, it's income, and any money you make is taxable. MTGox requires ID to deposit/withdraw significant amounts, so it'll be hard for you to tax evade.

That's a good question, and this has happened to bitcoin before. It has fallen from $30 to $1-2.
Bitcoin has an auto-adjusting difficulty algorithm. 
Less miners = lower difficulty = more rewards.
Let me try at an example as simplified as possible (ignoring difficulty adjustment block target). Correct me if I am wrong here guys.
1. Miner A earns 0.5 bitcoin / hour, on average, at $500/bitcoin. This is worth $250.
2. Bitcoin price drops to $1. A ton of miners decide it is not worth it, and stop mining. It sets off a cataclysmic reaction and people just follow and stop mining without calculating whether it is profitable themselves.
3. Miner A now earns 300 bitcoins / hour, on average, at $1/bitcoin. This is now worth $300.
Why would Miner A stop mining now?

You're still young, $7k is nothing. I know right now it seems to you like a lot, but if you think about it, a lot of people earn $80-100k a year. 
Assuming you're 25, and earn $30k/year on average from 30 onward and work till at least 60 (most people do), that's $900k, and you lost $7k or less than 0.8% of that.
We all make mistakes, I'm sure you learned something from this, or will learn something from this combined with another mistake. 
People lose millions in the stock market and other investments.
Perhaps this 0.7% loss will actually save you hundreds of thousands you would've lost in the future.
Don't sweat it, a 0.7% lesson is nothing. I'm sure it's a lot to you now, but it's nothing you can't work your way out of in a year. I've personally wasted years of my life, $7k you can earn back easily in a year.
All this said, I think you do have a small gambling issue (and not because you gambled on some site). Recognize it, and own it. The sooner you do that, the more it'll benefit you. You don't have to admit it to me, just admit it to yourself. Or don't, up to you, it's your life.
The people with real addiction problems are the ones who deny the possibility they have a problem. 
Ask any person you consider a real addict with no chance of recovery, "do you think you might have an addiction problem with ________" and you'll always get one type of answer, every time. If they say "I don't know, maybe," you already know they don't really have a problem.

source: 
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:06:38
yes, any coins you have *stored* on mtgox are lost.
technically, any coins you have on mtgox aren't yours yet, they're in mtgox's vault and you have an IOU, basically mtgox saying "they owe you XX coins."
they're only yours once they issue a transaction.
MtGox is currently not issuing any bitcoin transactions at this time.
For more information, just search for mtgox on this subreddit.
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:09:19
Short answer: No. You and the server you're communicating with both hold a secret code (seed) used to generate a list of numbers. 
But the server you're authenticating with can be compromised, and your seed can be stolen if someone has access to whatever device generates the numbers or the server itself.
All this really prevents is someone stealing your password and being able to use it anytime. But that's pretty significant.

I'm a bitcoin supporter, simply because it's an amazing innovation that can potentially solve a lot of problems, but this is misrepresentation and only opens bitcoin for attack.
Sending $5 using bitcoin, does not equal $5 on the other end.
1. **It does not consider exchange fees.**  Every exchange I've used has fees somewhere, and even if one temporarily offered free trades, like mtgox, it's usually a temporary thing, and in he case of mtgox, was a very costly one.
2. **It does not consider bitcoin transaction fees.** With the current state of the bitcoin network, it is very difficult to get a transaction processed without fees and would be unrealistic to represent it that way.
Edit: I looked up the transaction you referenced, and it is without bitcoin fees, but this was almost a year ago.
@_date: 2015-07-05 23:36:25
I agree with this comment. If it will bother the crap out of you to have it go less, sell now. Bitcoin's track record says that's a real possibility.
Just don't be mad when it becomes double, triple, or 100 times the value.
@_date: 2015-07-27 22:35:01
To be more supportive, I think you should illustrate how much those fees add up on paypal. e.g. $5 vs $4.48 does not seem like a lot, but multiply that by 100 and that's $500 vs $448, a difference of $52. If you are a freelancer for small projects / selling small items, that's not unrealistic.
$.52 isn't much, but $52 is a lot to someone who makes $500.

looks like the wrong address, that address has received/sent several transactions.
hopefully you just gave us the wrong address, but if you gave mtgox the wrong address, there's nothing they can do.. treat bitcoin like cash, if you sent a $100 bill to the wrong address, unless that person is incredibly nice, you can expect not to get it back.

bitcoin is open source, like linux.
What this means is, even if the current encryption scheme of bitcoin is cracked, a simple update to the code will fix it. 
There would only be a problem if open source somehow becomes obsolete, or a problem exists that prevents alternative encryption schemes for being used (e.g. all encryption schemes were cracked).
Even if the current coder of bitcoin was shot dead tomorrow, someone else can takeover the code and resume the project. How can we trust him? Just have other competent coders look over the code. That's the beauty of open source, you don't really need to trust anyone if you don't want to, just learn to analyze the code.
The real problem bitcoin has is adoption. Aside from silk road, and the occasional underground trade, I don't really see bitcoin used.
Hopefully that'll be solved in the future.
@_date: 2012-12-11 16:25:30
That's true. It's also possible that bitcoin will suddenly skyrocket, or the value will crash (like it did before) causing the difficulty to drop significantly.
Bitcoin was $11 just 2 months ago, $33 about a year and a half ago, and $2 roughly a year ago. For that reason, based on past performance, I'd say it's anyone's game.
The same can be said of any currency. If you take the currency of a small country, and you 'earn' money in that country, and suddenly it's value crashes (has happened many times), suddenly your 'earnings' are valueless.

right now, I think it's very difficult to live off bitcoins and leaves a negative impression of bitcoin as a whole. 
Instead, we should focus on keeping bitcoin on the forefront of people's minds, so that one day we really can be free of tyranny controlled currencies.
It's simple, start offering people your services (if you work) or your merchandise if you have a store for bitcoin. Charge an unreasonable amount if you want to, but as long the option is there, one day bitcoin will be worth something. And when there's competition, prices will naturally lower.

Since you're probably not going to give up just because people say it's a bad idea, and you want a definitive answer, I'll give you one :)
An Intel P4 3ghz mines at about 1.29Mhash/s.
This equates to about 0.07BTC per computer, annually. At the current exchange rate, that's $0.94 USD per computer, per year.
So you have access to about 30 computers, you can expect to make $30 a year. You decide whether that's worth it or not.
It's worth nothing before the bitcoin reward halving (which happened just recently) you would've earned double that.
@_date: 2012-12-02 23:01:13
1. Define difficult. Is it more difficult to use than your national currency? Yes. One is government accepted and endorsed, the other isn't.
2. It's about as a viable an investment as a company exchanged on the stock market. It can go up, it can go down, no one knows for sure, and it's heavily influenced by speculators.
3. The biggest pro is it is not guaranteed to be devalued over time. Unlike my national currency, where the government can print as much money as they want and make my dollar less rare (and thus worth less). 
Con: Only used by a small percentage of the population, is not widely accepted as a currency (yet). Free market means more scams.

First, read this, written by If you are going to open and properly forward a port:
1) I would store the majority of my bitcoins on a wallet that I would not accidentally run a virus or something that could compromise my bitcoins. (e.g. an offline wallet, or one on an usb stick). Assuming you plan on using this PC often, there's always a chance you will do something that will leave your wallet vulnerable, and there are viruses out there targetting bitcoin wallets specifically.
e.g. don't carry more than you would in a typical day in your own wallet outside your home.
2) It would not get in trouble the same way a tor exit node would. A tor exit node allows users to send almost anything (usually a lot of things that piss other people off) anonymously to many destinations. A bitcoin node is designed only to communicate bitcoin-related data to other nodes. 
But if a government or large organization suddenly decides to ban bitcoin though, that could change.

If the algorithm was really hacked, the difficulty would increase a lot more than two times. Also the design of bitcoin is basically hack proof, because the faster people discover algorithms, the faster the difficulty will increase and the harder it will become to discover the hash value.
Anyway, because the difficulty just changed, estimates are always way off. Wait half a day and see what it is.

I never mentioned Bitcoin a single time in my other post, because the video was completely flawed, regardless of Bitcoin.
But for those who are curious, here's why bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme, but the federal reserve is. In a ponzi scheme, the guy at the top always keeps getting more money. They say Satoshi (creator) has the first 50 bitcoins. Say satoshi spends everything except his last bitcoin. Suddenly he gets an offer he can't refuse, he's offered an entire country for his last bitcoin. Or someone points a gun at him and he trades it for his life. He decides to accept. Now satoshi has ZERO bitcoins. Any new value added to bitcoin, Satoshi does NOT benefit from. In a ponzi scheme, the guy at the top keeps getting money! He ALWAYS gets a percentage. 
In the case of the federal reserve, if they spend their last dollar, hey, let's just print another one! Satoshi can't do this!

Well actually, if you think about it, that's not so far-fetched as it sounds.
If you were to averagely flip one coin every 2 seconds, you could pretty accurately guess at how long it'd take you to flip one as a heads.
All of these average times are too based on percentages. When a calculator says it expects you to find a block in a week, for example, that's usually a 95% chance of finding one in a week. To find out the exact percentage you'd need to know the formula they use.
For example, the chance of you flipping at least one heads in 3 flips (6 seconds) would be 87.5%. I could say the average time for you to get one 'head' would be 6 seconds.
Bitcoin mining is no different really. You could have an estimated time of 2 weeks, but not get a single block in 5 years. The probability of that could be 0.0005%, but it's definitely possible.
Likewise, you could see an average time of 2 weeks and get 10 in 5 days. Chance is very low, but again, definitely possible.

There's three main things that really benefit bitcoin:
1. Innovation: New companies/products/ideas that are only available with bitcoin. 
2. Spreading the word: Not everyone knows about bitcoin, find appropriate time and places to spread the word about it. Some people are planning on giving out free bitcoins offline to spread the word. I'm not saying you need to do this, but that's one way to spread the word.
3. Adding value to bitcoin: Getting a new merchant to deal with bitcoins, or selling a service yourself for bitcoins. The more 'services' available for bitcoin, the more it becomes a real currency. Right now bitcoin has huge criticism because it's most commonly used as an investment instead of a currency.
Mining doesn't really help bitcoin much at this point, as almost everyone is already doing it.

Don't panic, unless it's been 24 hours, there's a good chance something is still just processing. That said, there's a few factors that would slow it down unnecessarily. Seems most people have mentioned others, here's one more:
Check to see how many 'connections' your bitcoin client has. If it has less than 8, that's probably why. Keeping your bitcoin client open longer will have establish m ore connections. (It is P2P). Alternatively, I hear forwarding the port for the bitcoin client helps a lot too.

You trade it to someone for a brand new Mercedes-Benz, informing him, that he has the only gold coin in existence! It's one of a kind! He decides it's worth it and agrees.
His gold coin has value because it's the only one in existence.
Suddenly you decide to make more gold coins. You trade those away, telling them there are only 5 in existence. Still valuable. But you keep doing it, you create more, and more, and more. You create so much that it's more common than grass.
Who gets screwed? The guy who bought that first gold coin. Suddenly, his *one of a kind* gold coin is the one of a kind coin anymore, and no one is willing to trade a Mercedes-Benz for it back.
Now imagine, instead of you being the guy who creates gold, you're the guy with the first gold coin. You'd get screwed over. The gold coin creators? They're the federal reserve.
**That's the real power of the federal reserve.** The interest rate is not what's wrong with the federal reserve! It's the fact there are no real restrictions on how much they can create! 
**Point 2** Jim wants $1.02 for his $1.01. That is true, but your video ignores **bankruptcy**! Jim is trying to get $1.02 for his $1.01, but what if he can't? He or his company goes bankrupt, and the reserve loses this $1 because Jim wasn't able to make back his $1.01. This is partly why banks charge interest, yes they're in it to make money, but they're also taking a risk lending anyone money! *The video implies no one ever fails to pay back a loan, and that's not true at all.* This is the building block for the entire argument, and since this doesn't hold true, the argument is flawed.
**Point 3** Joe and his garage sale... the video says, Joe doesn't simply want to break even! Yes he does! It's a general rule of thumb that people sell things in garage sales for less than they're worth. People expect 'deals' at garage sales. Most Joes aren't trying to profit off people! He's just trying to cut his losses because he's moving and doesn't want to have to move all his stuff!
**Point 4** Joe spending at KFC. The video say Joe wants $1.04 on nuggets. **What the?!** Joe is trying to profit off KFC?! No! We go to KFC well knowing they're making money off us, we just go there because it's convenient and it tastes good! Whoever gave this youtube guy the idea that people go eat fast food and expect to profit off it? We all expect KFC/Mcdonalds/Walmart to be making money off us! 
**Conclusion: The only part of this argument that makes any sense is that the federal reserve does charge interest rates, and the borrowers are trying to make money. The rest doesn't add up!**

The website looks very nice to me.
You need a reason to have sellers use bitwillet though. If I were a merchant I wouldn't use bitwillet personally (unless I loved bitcoin). You need to give sellers a reason to use bitcoin.
One possible reason could be, "accept an inflation-free currency." Maybe you can think of a better one.

You're kidding me right? An exchange is an exchange, they don't 'sell BTC' or 'sell dollars', they help facilitate the exchange of either.

The short answer regarding hacking it: Bitcoin was /written/ by "hackers" and thus inherently very secure. It uses SHA256 encryption, more secure than what many banks use for online banking. Right now the world's fastest supercomputers cannot come close to cracking SHA256.
If, from 10 years from now, SHA256 starts to become crackable, the open source community can just re-write bitcoin to use newer encryption.

The number of bitcoins everyone has is stored on a ledger on everyone client's computer. So technically your wallet can't lose any coins by crashing. All that's important on your computer is a key.
That said, to prove you created an address that belongs to you, so you have access to send coins to someone else from that address, you should backup your bitcoin directory, preferrably on an USB stick.
The default bitcoin client stores this in the your profile directory. This is usually:
C:\Users\KevinSeven11\Application Data\Bitcoin
C:\Documents and Settings\KevinSeven11\Application Data\Bitcoin
I would recommend backing up that directory. If you're worried someone might steal your usb key, encrypt it either by putting it in a zip/rar/7zip file with a password, or learn to use truecrypt.
Future versions of the bitcoin client will have encryption built-in, so even if someone had your key file, they'd still need a password.

It's completely legal. (At least, until the government says otherwise.)
It's just against paypal's TOS, where they say they forbid e-currency trading, and they consider bitcoin an e-currency. 
For that, you can have your account closed and funds seized. (Which was one of the selling points of bitcoin, your account can never be closed/frozen.)

This is actually, in my opinion, bitcoin's most important strength over *most* other currencies without limits. It is agreed upon that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence. So the rate of inflation is permanently limited. The rate of inflation is also already agreed upon, in the original white paper.
With other currencies, someone or some organization has the power (with the USD it is the federal reserve) to control the rate of inflation to however they see fit, devaluing *your* money whenever they see fit. Which is why people say bitcoin is truly yours, where other currencies are not.
I highly recommend looking into "the creature from Jekyll Island."

sorry, you're not the first person to come up with this idea, but two reasons why this doesn't work.
1. Bitcoin is designed to be use massive processing power to solve a difficult but pointless problem. That's how it gets 'proof of work.' It is an inherently simple problem that requires a lot of work.
2. Bitcoin ASICS, which are what almost all miners are 'Application-Specific Intergrated Circuits' - meaning they are designed to do one thing, in this case, mine bitcoins, and not much else.

Some people may recognize what bank this is from, but it doesn't really matter, not my first time transferring money from one bank to another, both with head offices in the same city, still takes about a week.
Also, I had to blackout my balance and account number, sorry about that, but that's what banks use to verify identity. 
And people say bitcoin is insecure. If I showed you my bitcoin balance, and my bitcoin address/account number, you couldn't suddenly prove you're me and move my money.

If the difficulty doesn't change, a 7970 will mine about 1 BTC/month. (The expected generation output, at 600.0 Mhps, given difficulty of 8974296.01489, is 1.0423169895543 BTC per 31 days.)
However, the difficulty changes constantly. In about 350 minutes, it is estimated to increase about 13%+.
The difficulty is set to re-target roughly every 2 weeks. The current trend is up. So it is likely you'll need TWO 7970s to achieve 1 BTC this month, and more as it increases higher.
For that reason, zekesonxx is probably right. 
That said, like bitcoin pricing, it is impossible to 100% predict what will happen.

I applaud you for being honest and providing all the facts, a lot of people twist facts in their favour.
That said, I don't think you can blame MtGox for this one. They're a lot of things, and made a lot of mistakes, but this isn't one of them.
You can't really blame the locksmith or your house builder if you left your house key around and you let a stranger into your house unwittingly. You can blame your house builder if they made it impossible for you to have extra security, but they don't.
Actually, my bank is way less secure than MtGox. One of the banks (ING Direct) I had money with, only allows you to set a 7 digit PIN code. (Numbers only, no letters. I e-mailed them, and they just said "oh, we're plenty secure, don't worry about it.")

Presenting information in a bias way does not help bitcoin.
Gold was down about $40 in the last 24 hours, from about $1335 an oz. represents a 2-3% drop.
The equivalent percentage drop in bitcoin at it's current price would be roughly $3-4 dollars. Bitcoin has definitely moved $3-4 in a 24 hour period.
If there's anything to be said, it's that bitcoin's value isn't tied to gold. But considering the minor gold drop, it's too early to make that consideration.
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:32:58

Anyone from IRS will tell you:
That said, the purchase of mining equipment should in theory be counted as expenses against your mining income.
It's also not taxable until you cash it out into USD. So you can cash it out at a time of your choosing, where it will have the best tax benefits for you. On the other hand, you may want to cash out the first year because you can use your mining equipment as expenses that year.
Whether or not it's very easy to avoid taxes is another question but would likely be considered illegal, so I won't go there.

Well I'd imagine if you had a significant sum of bitcoins, you'd leave it in such a way someone could access it if you died.
That said, let's assume all that was left was one bitcoin (from 21 million). 
At the moment, even one bitcoin is divisible to 100,000,000 micro units.
The bitcoin source code is maintained, and even if the current maintenance team was to die, someone could take over.
So if that was to happen, the code could be altered to allow for smaller units.
TL;DR: Having less coins just means the coins are worth more. Bitcoin would adapt by adding more decimal places. 1 BTC could be the equivalent of 1 trillion dollars.
@_date: 2013-10-19 17:38:27






Wait, hold on, an increase to $10k/coin, if we assume bitcoin is $175, is roughly 57x your initial investment.
Let's make this simpler for people to understand.
If I told you, that if you rolled a dice for $1000 and it landed:
* 1-2 ... you'd get 57 times your money back ($57,000)
* 3-4 ... you'd get your money back ($1,000)
* 5-6 ... you'd get nothing back
And  I let your choose your own amount..  You'd choose to invest only a little?
That said, my example was based on your odds. But I think that's not really good advice, I'd invest a lot more if the odds were really that good.
That said, even if I did believe your odds, I'd never invest more money than I can afford to lose in anything.

There are three problems with this:
1. The calculator* assumes the difficulty doesn't go up. the difficulty is not only going up, but is going up crazy fast (likely due to ASICS, so this semi-proves ASICS are real). 
2. The calculator* assumes you'd recieve your ASICS today. At the current rate of shipping and orders you're likely to receive it way after everyone already has their ASICS driving the difficulty way up.
3. The calculator* assumes bitcoin prices will be the same by the time you have the coins to sell. If bitcoin price crashes, you're screwed.
*this is based on most calculators on the internet.
In summary:
Yes, it could, and you could easily have a loss by the time you receive it. It's really no different than investing on a fast growing stock on the stock market, hoping it'd go up. It could, and you could be rich, but on the other hand, you could be out your initial investment.
TSLA Stock grew almost 300% over the last 2 1/2 months. If we used a *calculator* for that, then buying it now, then waiting a year, you can expect a growth of 81x (3^4), giving you a profit of $16,000 on a $200 stock investment... based on a calculator. 
The problem is, the calculator bases only on something that it doesn't expect to change, but is very likely to change.

The federal reserve, and **a lot of popular media reported news is biased**. Sure, they announce it like it's a big deal, but that doesn't mean it is.
Several large companies on the stock exchange have moved 3% in a 24 hour period. And if we didn't count just large companies, and only by the amount of stocks that have moved at least 3% in US alone in a typical 7 hour window, there are over thousands of companies (1452).
The point being, popular media makes a big deal out of little things to elicit specific responses. 
Bitcoin to me, represents freedom. 
As a community, we should not lower ourselves to the level the media uses and skew numbers in a bias way.
Disclaimer: I'm all for supporting and spreading bitcoin, as I'm familiar with the sad inflationary reality of federal reserve notes. But I do not believe in presenting information in a way that misrepresents facts.
