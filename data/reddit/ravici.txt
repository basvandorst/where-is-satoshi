I just posted a list of places that accept bitcoin. Overstock and Amazon.  Are they part of the ponzi scheme as well??

Infuriating.  For no other reason that the old Freedom of Speech thing.  He didn't write anything offensive or vulgar.  that teacher should be ashamed of themselves.  I would go in with a list of business that accept bitcoin.

This is hilarious.

Well then, you could try Google Translate, say it as it was translated (probably not sound/be correct in how you'd normally speak) and explain that you are here to clear up the confusion that happens during "translation".  Good luck.  I like what you are doing.  very cool.

your welcome.  AND here is a list of charities that accept Bitcoin.  Not sure where you live, but there are some prominent ones and local ones.  It would be AWESOME if you could fine some charities that are in the area where you live.

Hey UcY7cef!  
Good Morning! (East Coast time, anyway).  Just want to wish you and your son good luck today.  Here is one more article you can reference:
 
Yea, it is from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  Yep, a part of the Fed.  Talking about Bitcoin and it's long term viability.  
A discussion about Bitcoin is clearly one that everyone should be having.... especially the school where you son goes.
As a dad, I think my biggest frustration is that 1) your son completed the assignment... unless the assignment was "write a speech about a topic that I (your teacher) only agrees with and 2) the total lack of ignorance and acceptance from the teach and 3) how the teach handled the situation.  In my mind, all 3 of these things are completely unacceptable.
Your sons paper could have been about how aliens started the planet Earth using legos for all i care.  I'd like to believe that the point of the assignment was to come up with a statement, use references and facts to justify and validate the statement and then be able to speak to that point of view in front of a group of peers.
In your meeting, I would also address (with the principal and teacher and your son all in the room) your concern of lack of openminded-ness on behalf of the teach and potential backlash through the rest of the year.  Put that on the table now so that everyone is aware upfront that you are going to be looking for it.  I don't know all the facts but it seems to me that this wasn't a teacher just dropping a ball, it was a teacher pushing their own agenda in a callous and bullying way.

Question to OP as I read the comments: Are you more concerned about WHAT to say (for example you know nothing about Bitcoin) or HOW to say it (for example, you've never given a presentation in your life)?
I made an assumption that you know what you want to say, but unsure of how to get the audience to listen to you.

Oh and incase you can't find that list, here it is again:

is net neutrality out the window now?

Ok, so maybe I got a little obsessed here.  I am just very frustrated that a teacher wouldn't allow someone to take a stand on something without doing some research first.  Not that I expect you to read all of these links, but it may be helpful to bring them with you to your meeting.  Everything I have sent you tonight plus whatever else you have show that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is considered my both mainstream media AND financial institutions as something to be discussing and evaluating.  I really hope this helps.  Good luck and keep me posted on how it goes.  Thanks.

English speaker here.  If you are not fluent in French and they are expecting English (or whatever language you speak), start the presentation in French.  It doesn't have to be much -3, 5, 10 lines - mostly introductory stuff.  Bon soir.  Je m'appelle XXX.  I am honored to speak to you about....(in french).  At the end of the intro, say (in french) "since I do not want to make this topic more difficult to understand, I will present in my native tongue."
LPT: Use Google Translate to write the foreign language intro.  Listen to the sounds of the words, and write them out AS THEY SOUND (side tip: write them out as they are in French too).  Then practice the words are you wrote them (you don't need to know French - or any language - just how it sounds!).
TL;DR: Start presentations in language they understand.  This will get audience attention. After introduction, present in native language. Use Google Translate for intro.

This is a great idea.  Some marketing genius did this with Credit Card not Credits Card and Debit Card not Debits Card.  In some ways, they have already figured out how to sell this to the masses.  It would be helpful if we could have a Bitcoin Card that completes a transaction using bitcoin, even if the consumer never sees it.  From there, we can talk about Bitcoin as an investment and everyday currency.
