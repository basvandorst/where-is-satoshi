Helpful, thanks.

Is this true even when plenty of time can be allocated to confirm the micropayment? My impression is that no-fee transfers can be made but simply take longer to be confirmed in the blockchain.

Actually, it was seeing the tipbot on here that initially brought the micropayments idea to mind. The big question there is if the batched tips can be processed for the same transaction fee that would otherwise apply to each tip, even though you would probably be dealing with withdrawals from a separate wallet for each individual tip. If so, a high-volume site like the NYT could easily do batches of micropayments, with a fee included, every 5 or 10 minutes.

Thanks for the clarification.

As far as I know this kind of service doesn't exist yet, and I don't think there's any chance we'll see it in the U.S., Canada or any major EU country until the regulatory status of Bitcoin is clarified. Banks are subject to an array of strict regulation with respect to their customer accounts and adding a new type of account to hold an item that has not yet been affirmatively legally defined as a currency, a precious metal-equivalent or something else entirely would presumably represent a substantial risk that they could be in violation of applicable regulations.

Outside of a bank your other option for this would basically be a private insurer. I don't know much about insurance regulations, but my guess is that the law is probably a bit more flexible in that people can already get insurance for all kinds of assets.  Wouldn't surprise me if we see some small insurers offering theft/lost policies before we see banks creating accounts that can hold bitcoins. If I had more than $10K in bitcoins I would certainly be willing to pay $10/month or thereabouts for theft coverage.

Interesting. I had no idea the free transaction confirmation time is so long; I thought we were talking about an hour or so instead of ten minutes. That makes a whole slew of ideas a lot less practical unless there's some way for the service provider to bundle micropayments for batch processing and attach a fee payment to the batch. However assuming that the micropayments have to come from each customer's separate wallet that doesn't seem very feasible.
