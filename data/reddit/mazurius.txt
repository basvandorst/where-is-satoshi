According to what validation methods are we more or less going to ascertain that we are not going to see a repeat of the Ethereum smart-contract debacle? People are still a bit too cavalier with security. This kind of platforms handle money and are really security-sensitive. We really do not need a repeat of the security horrorfest that took place with the Ethereum DAO. 
**The security of RSK is our main priority. RSK´s blockchain is secured by merge-mining, which means that we can ...*
Their claims are a bit light on substance. Where are the repeatable investigations verifying their claims independently?

Ok, but this assumes that tor is eminently hackable.
In my impression, it may be possible to beef up tor security by instituting a secondary internal network using virtual machines or docker-style containers inside the communicating device. 
Tricking the device into revealing its external IP address will be much harder, because the container or virtual machine does not know this by itself. 
Any local abstraction could obviously be leaky. Therefore, I am not claiming that this approach would be failsafe.
Still, approaches such as the tor browser, with just one single line of defense, are trying to fix the problem in very much the wrong place.
Law enforcement will just mandate, bribe, or otherwise force the Mozilla Foundation to include and distribute hidden vulnerabilities, in order to breach the sandbox and obtain access to the honeypot, i.e. the user's externally-visible IP address on the network.
Hence, the real problem is the false belief in the ability of the Mozilla Foundation to fend off these law enforcement demands. Mozilla should simply admit that they cannot be trusted. That will finally convince users to solve the problem at the virtualization -or containerization level.
The players at that level are more numerous, less directly involved in the problem, sitting on smaller source code repositories, and should therefore be easier to monitor.
Therefore, my suggestion is to stop putting pressure on the Mozilla Foundation and allow them to drop their trusted role, and become untrusted instead. That would obviously be better for everyone involved.

_FBI’s use of Tor exploit is like peering through “broken blinds”_
This is utterly true.
Asking a device to reveal its IP address as it sees it, is not necessarily unlawful. If the device is willing to reveal that information, without any need to surreptitiously install malware on it, it just amounts to sending particular crafted messages that may indeed be categorized as deceptive.
But then again, the deceptive nature of a message depends on how you see things. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and so is deception.
Conversely, if you manage to send a deceptive messages to a banking system and entice it into wiring one billion dollars to the location of your choice, this may come across as deception. However, nobody forced the bank to program their machines in that way. Who says that it was not their intent to do it like that? Are we supposed to second-guess intent? This is an impossible task. Therefore, we should reasonably assume that it is the program itself that is the intent.
Therefore, I tend to side with the FBI: _the program is the intent._ However, in that case, the rule applies to every situation, and not just to the situations in which it suits the FBI.
Therefore, let's agree to the following invariant: _It is always lawful to end any message to any remote device. It is the responsibility of the listening programs on the device itself NOT to execute unwanted actions as a result of receiving the message._

"Identity verification
Required in case you choose to load your account by wire transfer. To comply with AML/CTF recommendations, we require our clients to verify identity by providing scanned copy of ID and scanned copy of utility bill or a bank statement which should not be older then 6 month. Copy should be in good resolution and colored."
**scanned copy of utility bill or a bank statement** that is the part that I really object to. It means everything and nothing. I am sick and tired of the endless nagging about these **utility bills**. Why, for heaven's sake why?

Yes. It is not a real "physical" separation from the internet. It tries to achieve the separation required by using virtual machine abstractions. This is obviously not as failsafe as true "physical" separation, but it still badly beefs up the efforts required on the side of the attacker.

True, speaking about pointless complaints, it is a bit unfortunate that the only ones who actually seem to be doing something about the problem, are those suicide bombers. That is another pointless complaint, isn't it? ;-)

Any link to malware/security reports about viruses specificially attacking the linux/x.org clipboard? It would indeed require a virus/trojan to get itself installed on a VM or on the host. I do not do any of these operations as root. The guest virtual machines are also not running in a root account on the host. How would installation of the virus into the any of system paths be achieved without root access?

It is more like saying: "Why would we mandatorily use the md5 hashing function? Why not let people try sh256 and ripemd160 too?" The advantage of that strategy is that if attackers manage to break md5, it will not bring down the entire castle. Genetic diversity is a requirement that should prevent attackers from being successful against the entire system. That is one reason why we need competing alternatives.
@_date: 2016-08-31 03:26:54
Making it mandatory would destroy the genetic diversity of the bitcoin ecosystem. A single successful attack could bring down the entire castle. There are existing and also future alternatives that should be allowed to compete with each other. What we need, is therefore to give this proposal a fair chance. What's the next step for that to be achieved? How/when can we test drive?
@_date: 2016-08-31 09:47:29


Yes, that is pretty much how credit cards work. So? They contend with a certain amount of fraud that costs them money. It could bring down the castle one day, but who cares? That would only make bitcoin holdings more valuable.


That is not how it works. I would be perfectly ok for someone to fork bitcoin and roll out an alternative with a larger block size limit. If the issue really matters, you will see adoption. If not, who cares?
We will need lots of competing alternatives. Bitcoin may be the first cryptocurrency, but it will not be the only one or last one.

This is what I do. Two virtualbox guests electrum running electrum only. One connected (contains a master public key). One disconnected (contains the private seed). The disconnected one can sign. The connected one cannot. The disconnected one could attack my seed, but cannot communicate it to anyone anyway. So, no point in attacking it. I copy/paste the transactions between both over the clipboard. I never run anything on the host besides the virtualbox manager. Then, I have encrypted a copy of the seed with gnupg and stored it remotely in my mailbox. Attacks are possible, but they are not trivial. The hope is that it substantially more difficult to attack my setup, and will therefore not be worth it to any potential attacker.

In my impression, bitwala has an AML policy to collect passport scans and utility bills. So, it is the same cesspool as any bitcoin exchange: 
I really do not feel like going through that kind of insanity again. I already have several btc/usd exchange methods, and the last thing I am interested in, is to again start hunting for utility bills, scanning them, and then hear that they want another type of utility bill, ad nauseam. Seriously, asking for scans again is a non-starter. No, no, no, and fuck no !!!

Yes. It looks like running a browser inside either guest, while engaged in such operation, is not advisable. For the sake of the argument, I have just installed a clipboard inspection program on the host now: `parcellite`. Hence, it is probably advisable to temporarily disable clipboard access to all other guests, and inspect the clipboard while performing the inter-guest signing operation. One possible solution is to use a tool like `clipit`:
Create local pgp key: `$ gpg --gen-key`
And then test pgp-assisted, encrypted/signed communications over the clipboard:
`$ echo "hello" | gpg --sign --encrypt --armor -r none `  `\` 
`         | clipit --clipboard | gpg -- 2&gt; /dev/null ; echo "result: $?"`
`result: 0`
In my impression, it should not be possible for an attacker to inject any other data in the clipboard stream without causing a non-zero result code. The security of this scheme rests on gnupg's ability to verify signatures. This ability is more or less accepted to exist.
One thing is clear. You would still be counting on local abstractions to work properly and not be leaky, in order to fend off attackers. As you know, beyond a certain level of complexity, all abstractions are deemed to be leaky. Hence, it will still never be a 100% valid substitute for an air-gapped signing device. However, even then, even with air-gapped hardware devices, you will still be facing possibly leaky abstractions. I am not sure that a hardware-assisted solution would be substantially more abstraction-free and hence substantially more secure.

I tried to sign up to bitwala today, but the registration page is under maintenance. I wanted to test your service by sending money to my mother for her airplane ticket.
I wonder, what will be the AML/KYC requirements? It says nowhere through how many hoops I will have to jump just to send a few hundred euros to a SEPA account ...
Maybe my mother's bank will also block the payment.
Next, I expect that they could close her account for suspicious bitcoin-related transactions. She will have to rush and quickly find another bank to receive her retirement pension. They may also wholesale have blacklisted her, however. That means that she will have to receive her retirement pension by postal cheque from now on. I have read that the post office still serves otherwise blacklisted users on humanitarian grounds, on the condition that the city council's welfare office files an official request with the post office. That particular emergency procedure may take up to 12 months to succeed. If a pensioner does not collect a pension payment for 6 months, they lose it. It will also trigger an investigation at the retirement pension office as to whether the pensioner is still alive. That means that the pensioner will have to produce a birth certificate and a police report that confirms their identity, and a police testimony that they have seen the pensioner alive. They are very suspicious of pensioners, however, because there is a lot of fraud by people pretending to be an already deceased person in order to keep collecting their pension. So, that also tends to materialize in lots of additional anti-terrorism investigations.

In the naysaying wars, the first, important step is to demand that your employer (or clients, or customers) pay you in bitcoin. This is easy for people working in fields where there are more jobs than candidates and pretty much impossible for people who work in other fields. Next, you can try to demand that your suppliers take bitcoin. Again, it is a question of market power. For the remainder of your expenses, you will have to convert bitcoins to fiat. bitcoin-to-fiat debit cards do make sense in that realm.
