Bitcoin days destroyed gives a better indication of transaction volume as a lot of wallet software and payment providers move coins around after 1 transaction, but as this all happens in a single day it doesn't add up to the bitcoin days destroyed value (only the initital payment). Coins which haven't moved for a long time will 'destroy' more days upon moving.

Yeah indeed, I think the streaming model is a better model for music/movie content. Netflix, Spotify... can keep distributing revenue rightfully, and it's simpler to use than a bittorrent client.  
I think you have to look at the long tail to see the best benefit of this idea.

miners nowadays have to cover their costs, immediately.  
2 years ago, people started mining to hoard coins.
@_date: 2015-06-04 08:28:33
I know, but in essence the transaction fee today is about 6.5 $ if you include the mining reward. At this point in time, the incentive should still be the block reward not the fees.
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:50:02
They will hoard euro's (in cash) for when the Dragma would return which would devaluate massively compared to the Euro. So relatively speaking the more euro's they can hold now, the less their wealth would devaluate. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 11:21:56
content creators should embrace this idea, and by having the first version of a certain data (say an album of your own made music), they get all the revenue from the downloads. That's what they mean by "niche" torrents.

Try to find physical gold in Greece, you won't find it. The electronic/paper price is completely rigged in a fractional reserve way. Physical supply is getting more and more scarce.
@_date: 2015-06-04 07:27:23
Miners get a 25 BTC reward + all collected fees.
The fees per block are around 0.25 BTC.
So imo it's unlogical that today the fees are the driver for miners to either include or exclude transactions from blocks (they make up 1% of the reward). Of course 0 fee transactions shouldn't be tolerated (especially in the long run).

I've been pouring money into stocks, dollars and bitcoin the past few years. The stocks have done awesome, dollars have done good, bitcoin lags a bit behind (no idea of my average price).  
I still own a lot of euro's though, and I'm not keen on adding to that number. Next stop: big inflation and a new commodity cycle (watch gold, silver, copper, oil... the next few months)  
Don't forget that stocks stay in your possession when a bank would fail, the money in your savings account will not. And there are still undervalued stocks out there...

I've found some stores to give a discount when you pay with bitcoin.

I have a simple excel file for this matter.
I just made a calculation for OP's case.
He would have bought BTC for an average price of $400 (from 1 November up until 1 August)
And it would have been a staggering 35% below the average bitcoin price of $620.
He would have a 46,7% profit btw.

Dollar Value Averaging is even better imo.
The amount you put in will fluctuate depending on the price of bitcoin. But the growth of the value will be constant and you can proof mathematically that you will always pay a lower than average price. I use this method for my pension fund monthly payments.

5400 transactions that did go through, but haven't been included in a block yet. (the first confirmation and the transactions being added in the blockchain ledger)  
Accounting for 0,55 BTC or around 131$ for the miner that does include them, that's the incentive.

I think a single payment to pay for 1 show would be pretty easy to implement, bitcoin can just be an in-browser protocol.  
Many people would like to just watch 1 movie and don't have the hassle of finding the right torrent+subtitle. Why not pay $3 (or 7 mBTC) per movie in 2 clicks through netflix directly?

It's a pretty popular service in Belgium (pay on demand). eg. for football you either pay €17 monthly for ALL games. Or you pay €10 once and get a pass for 1 day. Lots of people order 1 day packages, invite some friends over and watch the game. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 13:50:58
Definitely, same goes for the principle of the paywall for news articles. As more browsing is happening through mobile devices, more potential revenue is to be made through mobile payments. Bitcoins suits perfectly.
@_date: 2016-01-07 13:49:24
Yes I know. But I'm sure there will be more than 1 competitor in the entertainment business. And it's still possible that there will be "more expensive" shows where you have to pay extra to watch even though you pay a monthly subscription. (like the Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight).
@_date: 2016-01-06 09:53:10
Historically banks that went too far in their fractional reserve could go bankrupt.

1. Some shows could be "premium" content, where even subscribers would have to pay extra to watch them. (eg. live streams of sport events)  
2. Some people just prefer to stick to their classic TV subscription but might be tempted to pay for single movies/series. I'm not one of them, I love netflix, spotify... The older generation presumably  
3. Why do people buy DVD's / Blurays?  
4. A Netflix competitor might make their business model to be free to use for most content, but pay per view for certain content. In the end an average customer would pay the same or more (so they hope).

Well if they weren't in control of the on chain capacity you'd really have a choice but Blockstream basically pays the developers.

Seems much like the equivalent of dollar backed by gold. Alas history gave us the Nixon shock, officially ending the Bretton Woods system.

Suppose you'd start your own altcoin based on the bitcoin protocol. If some large miner would direct its computational power towards your coin they would easily have more than 50% of the hashing power and have control over your blockchain. The combined hashing power of the bitcoin network is too strong to be attacked this way.  
That's why banks... talk about "private" blockchains, but they basically miss the whole point of being decentralized and are thus worthless.
