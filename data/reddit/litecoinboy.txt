For sure,  the main benefit for me would be extra security. Pass my milti sig to tranafer from my savings address to my pocket money address. Then also have everyone in my family with 1 part of the multi sig, requiring 2 sigs to initiate transfer.
Then in a pinch my kids can have access to needed money in emergencies. (Sneakers are an emergency?)
This is probably one of the most important features (other than the very obvious) of bitcoin. Im supprised that there isnt options for multisig in every wallet out there.
We need a pledge drive to fund for development of this feature in a simplified format... or somethin...
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:58:58
This is something andreas is always talking about being a huge benefit that bitcoin has over fiat, and I agree.
There needs to be some serious dev resources spent on making this easier to execute.
I want to see a scenario like this in real life.
My kid wants to buy sneakers online, makes the purchase, and then I get an alert on my phone email or whatever wallet software I use, I then want to be able to review the purchase and if I think its a purchase we want to make, I submit (press ok, or verify or whatever) and then my part of the multisig is transmitted. 
Purchase executes and a few days later my kid gets their sneakers.
Thoughts? Positives,  negatives? 
@_date: 2014-01-12 16:07:09

Years ago i had a portion of a downpayment invested in BTC, queue the "dip" from $120 to about $75. I noobed up and sold, of course. When i told my new wife about it (i may or may not have cried), she just said dont worry about it, if you believe in this, buy it back, we can still afford a down payment, it just wont be as nice of a house. So i bought back, higher of course. We now own a house, and i still hodl a bit of my stack.
Maybe not as prolific as bitcoinbabeau's story, but i bet a number of us have had single moments like this that have changed our lives.
Thanks Satoshi :)

So, would never use this.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:55:37
This is a cool idea, but i would never use a wallet that someone once had the private keys too. Even if they promised that no one had seen the private keys, or they had deleted all traces of the private keys, or etc.
I wonder if there is a way around this through a multisig or something...
I have made lots of paper wallets before and it can be slightly daunting. I dont even want to print via my wifi printer due to security risks.

I dont know why you are against gay marriage, take your hate speech somewhere else.

yuh huh its a exploit cuz its uh exploit duh huh.
@_date: 2017-04-21 01:48:56
I think this is closer to the opinion i have.
I think the issues should be addressed seperatly.
I know you dont agree,  but i think if segwit is actually being opposed because of the covert asicboost we should allow it and deal with as a seperate issue.
I know i am not in the majority, i just hate to see inovation stifled because of morals.
Does this make me a nazi? :(
@_date: 2017-04-21 01:34:13
I just think its silly at this point to allow our ideals to hinder segwit. I bet if we allowed "covert" asicboost  we would have a much higer % signal.
Then we can put forth another masf at a later date that is based soley around blocking the covert asicboost if we have such high moral standards.
When did we become the morality police?
@_date: 2017-04-21 00:58:13
Yeah... but who cares?

@_date: 2017-04-21 17:09:57
Lol thanks :-)
Edit: i was well aware i would be down voted, im tottaly ok with it.
@_date: 2017-04-21 11:37:46
Obviously, but how much does asic boost decrease the security by?
@_date: 2017-04-21 01:06:52
You trying to stawman me?
Obviously we are all against central mining.
Thats not my point, my point is i dont give a fuck how they solve the block and no one else should either.
@_date: 2017-04-21 11:34:27
Call it whatever you want, its more efficent hashing.
@_date: 2017-04-21 17:06:05
Lol! Aww ya got me :(
@_date: 2017-04-21 17:31:41
Well now we are talking about profits, im not concerned with margins or profit. 
I understand, the more profit the bigger the edge, the bigger the edge the more profit... 
How about we also lobby the entire world to price their electricity the same so no one else has an edge?
None of that is my concern.
@_date: 2017-04-21 11:36:40
Yes... i agree... that is what i mean by solving a block.
@_date: 2017-04-21 01:00:54
I mean crypto is a little bit about freedom...
They have the freedom to solve the hash anyway they want.
Secret method or not, i just want a solve for the next block.
Edit: oh, also, you seem to be a jerk :)

Exploit is a relative term.
@_date: 2017-04-21 17:08:37
I understand your view, i just do not agree that it is as big of a deal as people seem to be making it.
@_date: 2017-04-21 11:42:38
I thought everyone was ok with asicboost, just not covert asicboost? 
Security is important, but so is progress.
I just think if the miners are stopping segwit via soft fork because of their inability to use their covert lets remove that limitation within the soft fork and deal with asicboost or any other decrease in security in a seperate soft or hard fork.
Is that not possible?
@_date: 2017-04-21 11:35:13
Yes i know im sorry.
I am no shill.
I just want segwit, all this drama is fucking silly.
@_date: 2017-04-21 11:35:59

@_date: 2017-04-20 23:26:31
How about we dont even block the covert use of it?
Who gives a shit?
We, the crypto community, trying to block something like this is super hypocritical. 
I dont give a fuck if they have an edge, if you find a way to have an edge and i dont, too bad for me.
Where is the freedom?
We give a shit because someone has a patent?
I bet half of us think patents are a fucking joke anyways.
