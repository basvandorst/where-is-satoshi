I have spent over 2 bitcoin on goods and services (no gift cards), if there isnt mass adoption then bitcoin will be replaced or circumvented....the general public even in big cities have never used bitcoin and seem reluctant to try because they dont want to seem stupid...mass adoption by the general public is the most important issue right now, look at the minitel compared to the world wide web

plus it is down the street from il Brigante Pizza, which is the best pizza in Paris. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 16:05:13
Tripadvisor is nothing to measure a good resto in Paris by, you should know that...I have walked by the Il Bugigattolo many times and the food on peoples plates didnt inspire me at all. I have brought many reputable food critics to Il Brigante and they all loved il Brigante pizzas, they are quite slow in their kitchen and you have to wait, but it is worth it to me. My heritage is southern Italian and I know what good pizza is...I am very glad to hear that Il Bugigattolo accepts Bitcoin, I carry at least 1 Bitcoin with me on my phone so I would use Bitcoin to pay for food...but just because a resto accepts Bitcoin doesnt mean I would pass up the incredible pizza at Il Brigante...sorry.

Great job, I watched your entire presentation and it hit the most important points and was educational and and easy to understand for people that a new to Bitcoin.

for me it was the best solution because the website already has a very successful e-commerce business with a traditional payment solution....this way i could create the Bitcoin site and not make an issues for their traditional business...Bitpay to me is an easy to implement solution that makes good sense for small businesses. I didnt want to just add Bitcoin to the payment process because to me for Bitcoin to be taken seriously as a currency it should not be based on the current dollar or euro exchange rate but rather the price for the goods should be displayed on each item for purchase with the direct BTC and mBTC price. That is the next step for this fashion label...to commit to a BTC / mBTC price and give a nice discount for using BTC.

Actually the decentralized nodes are a really good thing, but what is more important is mining, one CPU one vote as the white paper states. The fact that mining is centralized mainly in China is a real problem. I think Bitcoin on a small scale is amazing and revolutionary especially for the unbanked of the world. Sadly the scaling issue is still totally unsolved and I think LN is a horrible solution that wont work because it wont be adopted by the masses for a laundry list of good reasons. I am not anti-Bitcoin I just think it will be replaced by another crypto that will figure out solutions to the issues that Bitcoin couldnt manage to answer. If you look at the market dominance of Bitcoin over the past few years it has been sliding downward very quickly against other cryptos, I think this trend will only continue. I think you and I have some areas that we agree and want to see happen in the long run, I think we just disagree on what vehicle will take us there. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 15:04:58
I totally agree with you. The days of expensive movies and tv shows packed with advertising are over. Content creators should be looking at a price of 10 to 15 cents per hour of content. That way with a global audience good content would have revenues that would cover production costs and pay fair wages. A good balance needs to be reached between content creators and producers and the audience and I think crypto currencies and a blockchain system are the key to making this balance happen.Interesting links...thanks
@_date: 2014-12-08 08:47:04
If it wasnt for large media companies like HBO or Netflix or Showtime, "content" like Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad and The Wire would almost never be created. These productions are massive in budget because it takes more than one or two "artists" to make these shows...ever wonder why there are so many reality shows on TV, it is because advertising isnt working the way it used to and because people steal content by downloading it. I do believe that Bitcoin / crypto currencies are the future because shows or "content" can be paid for as a pay per view model (ie not tipping) through micro-payments - if you have a TV series you can watch it with a digital key only when you make a micro payment of 15 cents to the content owners or creators.....but make no mistake, if you are downloading content that is owned by a "big evil company" you are screwing over and stealing from writers, actors, make-up artists, gophers and everyone else involved in the production. When these big companies loose money they stop making content or they strip everything down to bare minimum for the production and the budget and cater to idiots and make "Honey Boo-Boo".

do you believe that video content creators and musicians want to have their work shared to the audience for free? it should be the content creators choice if they want to share their work on the Internet for free or at a price and people should respect that....it will be ironic when the blockchain is the device that will issue the keys to rent or buy content and prevent thieves from taking what does not belong to them.

We have sold several hundred already and we are taking these cases on a 10 city tour of Europe in top art galleries to sell the rest. All the David Choe cases and any cases from 2012 will be sold out easily. I have been an active supporter of Bitcoin and made it possible that original artwork by some of the very top street artists could be bought with Bitcoin because I believe that the only way to get Bitcoin to flourish and be accepted is by having cool things available people can buy with Bitcoin. Otherwise Bitcoin will have little value. This is my contribution.

Back in the day when people paid to watch movies, you bought or rented a DVD and that video was protected by an encryption. Then one day someone figured out a way to break the encryption key that prevented you from "ripping" the DVD and having an unprotected copy of the video that you could upload to the Internet and share.
What if someone figured out the encryption that protects people from creating counterfeit bitcoin and then people were flooding the network with fake bitcoin? This would surely devalue your bitcoin and it could be a real problem to stop this. Should people just give up on Bitcoin because  it is "a fruitless endeavour" to fight copying? Or should a solution be found to prevent people from having the ability to do this? 
That is what content creators, artists and writers are trying to do today. Not rely on donations or crowdfunding...no one should have to beg to make a living on what they create if people are consuming and enjoying what they make. Just because something is digital does not make it worthless.

I think it does matter what people think that make their living working to make a product that people feel they are entitled to just because it is in a digital format.
If someone takes Bitcoin from someone else is that OK with you? Bitcoin is digital and does that work into the "nature of information" model? I think some level of sharing is good but I know many professional musicians from bands I am sure you have heard of because they are all very famous  that actually make less than a person that makes french fries at McDonalds because people feel entitled to steal their work and not pay for it. I am hoping that there will be a way for people to create creative works and set their own price and people will have to pay this price or not get to see or hear this content and people that find a way around this will be charged with petty theft because that is what they are ...thieves.

A bitcoin is also just digital data, do you think that bitcoin should also be free for everyone to just take? i doubt it. maybe there will be a way for a blockchain like delivery system for content that is secure and fair. I do hope that independent artists develop video content and that good content is rewarded financially, but not by a tipping system but with micro-payments that when the audience is big enough can make a working business model that gives artists what they rightfully deserve.

The only way Bitcoin rises above being viewed as just a commodity to trade is when everyday users start using Bitcoin as a currency in everyday life. Projects like the one at MIT are what is needed now. If someone wants to pay for a service in Bitcoin and then the merchant can pay for other goods and services then this will build the demand. Seems like everyone is just hoarding the Bitcoin that they buy because they keep thinking that the price will go up and up and they can cash out. Gift cards are not the answer...when a young woman can buy the kinds of things she wants to buy in a department store or a make-up store then people will start taking Bitcoin more seriously. Right now I think the price will continue to fall quite steeply and continue to fall until the Bitcoin are used more in transactions by everyday people, just like the adoption of the Internet.

Even with all the NSA recording every email, every phone call and text message...they NEVER find something in time to prevent a terrorist attack or do anything to warn people. The Boston bombers were on a Russian terror list and they informed the CIA and FBI about these guys, yet they were still able to pull off their terror attack on the Boston Marathon. The more the government of USA and UK want to take away all privacy even though we should have the right to privacy, the more I see they want to control data and information in case the people decide they have had enough and start really protesting or doing anything that will change the uber rich / corporations from controlling everything and everyone....Good morning NSA!

This outlines one of the problems that need to be solved with Bitcoin...the benefits of decentralized currency is also one of the biggest obstacles to the success of bitcoin being widely adopted and valuable. It is an issue when coins are lost or a mistake is made in a payment and noting can be recovered or reversed. People make mistakes,keys get lost and exchanges get hacked. Possible solutions to this problem? People wont feel safe putting their wealth into something that can just disappear because of a hack or a fire burns down your house and your paper wallet went with it...Could be people can opt in for a centralized digital currency solution?

In 1996 if you sold online you would see some decent sales...almost all the crazy VC money was thrown at e-commerce start-ups because people did buy all kinds of things online frequently...thats why we had 25 million dollars thrown at selling pet food online.
I live in one of the world's biggest cities and I would have a hard time finding choices to spend Bitcoin locally. First there needs to be merchant adoption and a discount on their good and services for using Bitcoin, then everyday people in every demographic need to get small amounts of Bitcoin in their possession so they can spend it locally. Then there needs to be local in person education where people can go to find out everything they want to know about Bitcoin, the risks, how to be secure, ect... if this doesnt happen soon then another crypto currency, most likely one controlled by governments will be issued and that will replace Bitcoin. the price of Bitcoin will go under 100 USD by the end of this year if this problem isnt sorted out.

This is the main issue with Bitcoin that needs to be fixed if anyone wants to see the exchange price rise again. The success of Bitcoin will only come through adoption and use of Bitcoin in everyday local stores that are of everyday use. Grocery stores would be a great start. People in general have the perception that Bitcoin is some sort of Dungeons &amp; Dragons money that you can only buy gift cards with. If Bitcoin is hoarded in 2015 and is not in the hands of both men and women so they can spend Bitcoin frequently, then you can forget about value going anywhere else but down. I am a really big believer in Bitcoin and its potential, but not having significant sales on a local level is the downfall of Bitcoin.

My question is: sometimes governments manipulate money supply or make other economic maneuvers to prevent economies from falling into an economic depression or prevent economic catastrophe. Since Bitcoin is mined and the money supply is set, if Bitcoin was a global currency how could economic disasters be prevented? or would it just be a pure free market where a situation could come up and the free market just needs to correct itself and the people in the middle would just have to suffer and wait it out? 
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:47:59
I spend Bitcoin as much as I can on websites and in stores because Bitcoin will only have value when it is adopted by the public. If everyone is afraid of buying a 6 million dollar pizza and then doesn't spend Bitcoin and show people what cryptocurrencies are about then Bitcoin will be less than 10 dollars in a year or two and then another cryptocurrency will be made to replace Bitcoin. Turn people on to Bitcoin whenever you get a chance.

The main way Bitcoin has any value as a currency is when merchants accept it and customers use it....if it wasnt for companies like Bitpay that make it easy for merchants to accept Bitcoin online and in their stores then Bitcoin would be worth very little.
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:48:24
gold has value in the same way pork belly futures has value but i dont go to the store with bacon and try to pay for something with bacon. There is a difference between value and currency. If Bitcoin is going to become a digital currency and not be replaced with a government issued cryptocurrency then it needs to be widely adopted and used as a currency. When most teenage girls have a Bitcoin wallet and can buy their clothes and make-up and music then Bitcoin will have succeeded. Right now this is not the case.

Everyone seems so content with Shift cards and gift cards and all other third party solutions, when in reality this is not what is made Bitcoin an interesting solution at all. The Shift card is a credit card...so what is the difference between using a fiat backed credit card and a Bitcoin backed credit card. Gift cards too are not what makes Bitcoin significant or valuable.
This morning I just sent a Bitcoin payment from by my Bread Wallet to my Ledger Wallet (376 bytes) with normal priority and all this BS about ten minutes to get one confirmation...well it has been over two hours and not one confirmation. I think Bitcoin has some serious problems that need to be addressed and solved in the very near future. If not you will see the value of Bitcoin drop drastically this year.
@_date: 2016-03-26 18:26:28
the bank that issued the card is based in UK...the Brits wont take Friday through Monday off.

Widespread adoption? What is Bitcoin's competitive advantage now? All the reasons I bought into Bitcoin in 2014 turned out to be not the case or not possible. I believe the price of Bitcoin has been heavily manipulated by exchanges and not reflecting any kind of current market value. The big tell to me is that the public has not at all adopted using Bitcoin, less merchants accept it now than before...I think there are much better alternatives for cryptocurrencies now than Bitcoin. Name me one real competitive advantage Bitcoin has over other forms of payments?
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:25:36
The original post was about widespread adoption of Bitcoin since the price is above $3000 now. My reply is what makes anyone think that there will be widespread adoption of Bitcoin at any price when there isnt a competitive advantage now in using Bitcoin, price of Bitcoin doesnt matter. How is my reply unrelated to the original post?

What made Bitcoin powerful to me is microtransactions, if Bitcoin transactions cost more than 20 cents, I dont see the point in it.
@_date: 2016-11-07 09:41:32
so Bitcoin is a settlement layer then, is that what you are implying? I dont see the value in Bitcoin is that is the case, what is the major advantage of Bitcoin then? anonymous transactions? not really...microtransactions will make paying for advertising free video content possible and also many other very valuable services...I know this is a touchy subject, what Bitcoin was meant to be used for and what it is designed for but what got me interested initially is turning out to not be the case...which is kind of sad.
@_date: 2016-11-07 19:51:20
I agree that Bitcoin works and should work for micropayments...but it seems that the discussion here on this thread is that Bitcoin is not meant for handling mass transaction like Visa or PayPal and that the fees could be as high as several dollars per transaction and that is OK too...7 cents should be the average costs of a transaction, if it is more than the cost of sending PayPal then good luck with mass adoption (which I am hoping and working for myself)
@_date: 2016-11-07 14:10:35
I have read the Bitcoin whitepaper, but the cryptoanarchist manifesto sounds like a waste of my time...as far as a decentralised commodity, if China decided to shut down all mining in China and make Bitcoin illegal in China, which they could do very easily...Bitcoin would be where? Please tell me about this decentralised commodity. For Bitcoin to be taken seriously by people and by governments, they need mass adoption and to have this they need a reason the everyday person could use Bitcoin and I dont believe the censorship issue or government control issue is what will drive mass adoption.

Sorry to bother you with so many questions, but what percentage of transactions today would you guess are spam volume? I am working on a television series of 12 episodes where street artists paint portraits of homeless people around the world and include a Bitcoin QR code painted into the portrait with a stencil....so that people in person and on social media can donate directly to the person in the painting with Bitcoin....and microtransactions are a big part of this concept so that you can send even 25 cents.... This program has already been picked up by several international TV networks with potential audience of 60 million per episode. If I have to wait for microtransactions to be possible then I could just use Visa or PayPal and my concept is really worthless. I launched a test site to show the concept and worked already with some of the biggest names in street art around the world.... if you are interested  or have any feedback - 
@_date: 2016-11-07 11:17:00
I can go buy gold bars down the street from me, with no ID....gold pretty much does all those things as well. What made me interested in Bitcoin most was the ability to move both small and large amounts of value globally for a price lower than Visa or PayPal would charge. I thought that the unbanked of the world would also find great value in this because of the low transaction fees. It seems like censorship resistant, government independent asset would be great if you are looking into criminal uses, but most people want to be able to transfer value globally at the lowest cost possible....like sending a photo or text on the Internet. To be honest I dont see mass adoption of Bitcoin over the past few years, I think people have a hard time already understanding the point of Bitcoin and what its major advantage is over other solutions that work already right now. Censorship resistant and government independent does not make Bitcoin a competitor because most people dont really care about this and gold and cash can do this already.

Finding a Bitcoin ATM isnt easy in most parts of the world...even in major cities like Paris and London there is only one or two Bitcoin ATMs in the city. Either you get merchants to adopt Bitcoin and accept it because they wont have to pay the charges that credit cards make them pay...and  the merchants might even get more sales over their competitors because they accept Bitcoin in their store...carrying paper wallets in books to find the elusive Bitcoin ATM just to get the same money they could have got through the very easy to find ATM that uses bank cards....makes Bitcoin seem like a pain in the ass. This needs to change.

The problem is not just getting Bitcoin but where do you spend it on everyday items like going to the grocery store and buying other things. There are ways to do this but it much more work and headache...this needs to be easy to do and businesses need to be educated on the great benefits and advantages of accepting Bitcoin...and people are not spending Bitcoin on everyday things like food when they do have it.

I travel a lot for work and I wear my Ledger Wallet around my neck in case I get robbed or somehow lose my wallet.

The interview is referring to cryptocurrencies in general, I dont think banks have to worry about Bitcoin much, but there will be a cryptocurrency in the near future that will be a great disruptor to their system. To threaten the banks they would need to do micropayments and transaction fees would need to be very very inexpensive - under 10 cents /transaction. Also would need to be able to scale to the size of Visa and much more ON CHAIN and be decentralized globally and that means not the majority of mining in one country. I speak to people at very high levels in banks and they are not at all afraid of Bitcoin because they know Bitcoin can not compete and there is less public adoption now than before, so they feel Bitcoin is fading away slowly, the only newsworthy aspect of Bitcoin is the price of Bitcoin measured against fiat currencies and this is not a representation of real current value but rather a price inflated drastically by exchanges and market manipulation. Th concept of cryptocurrencies is a major change for banks in the future, but not a threat.
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:02:26
So Bitcoin is currently used a currency? Not really. Immutable decentralised global asset ledger, so are many other cryptos that have  better functionality than Bitcoin does as this. Wikileaks could have survived off bank wires which are currently cheaper and easier to to than Bitcoin. Plus Wikileaks could have accepted any other crypto like zcash which is at least anonymous. Bitcoin still doesnt have a competitive value over other cryptos or fiat payments that would justify the current market value. You are being had.

In the late 90s I knew so many "paper millionaires" because they had stock in companies that had stock prices that had very high values. Companies like Silicon Graphics, Netscape and many many other companies that are not worth anything today. I think Hearn was correct and made the right decision. The aspects of Bitcoin that made me excited and gave it real value turned out to not be the case and the tech is not that special currently. I think LN is bullshit and a long way off, the only way Bitcoin will survive is to keep pumping tether which backed by nothing of value into the Bitcoin market through Bitfinex and drive the price up so the people still holding Bitcoin feel like it is a good investment. The facts are Bitcoin currently is quite broken and has far less public adoption of Bitcoin as a currency now than before. The markets are being artificially manipulated because they know is long as the price goes up thats all any of them care about. When the mass sell-off happens, the exchanges wont have anywhere near the fiat currency to pay the sellers. The exchanges will go down or close or just disappear. You can laugh at Hearn now, but he was totally correct of his position on Bitcoin. Give it one year max and you will see. If you think I am wrong, explain to me one competitive advantage Bitcoin has over Visa or PayPal?

I was around when the Internet was starting and something very few people knew about. I immediately saw its value and got involved and still am. I saw how the Internet would grow into something massive because it did have a competitive value over things like fax machines. I also saw many Internet companies have massive overvaluations and then turn into nearly worthless companies really quickly. If you believe I am some sort of person that can understand the value of emerging technologies, you couldnt be more wrong. You still didnt answer my question of what is Bitcoin's competitive advantage over other similar technologies? "Store of Value" is not an answer either, anything can be a store of value like "Magic the Gathering" cards. Wikileaks has nothing to do with Bitcoin and Visa, today Bitcoin can not even dream of competing with Visa or even PayPal. If Bitcoin was anonymous and could be used as a currency privately on the dark web then that would at least be of some advantage and that would give it value, but it is not anonymous as we now know. So you let me know when you have one idea where Bitcoin has a real competitive value that remotely justifies the market price.

website  - 
Bitcoin buyers get the art gallery wholesale rate of 40 percent off on signed limited edition art prints by some of the biggest names in street art. 
They are made in Paris using a lithographic press built in 1881. This press has created the original signed prints directly for artists such as Picasso, Matisse, Miró and Chagall. Today this press is making art prints for the world's top contemporary artists and art galleries. The prints coming off this antique press are usually found in museums, international exhibitions, and in public and private art collections. These art prints are created using an oil and water printing process, layering each color individually.
Each print is on made on 100 percent cotton paper, hand torn, stamped and numbered and then signed by the artist. Instead of an ink jet process used to make posters and other art prints, the cotton paper comes into direct contact with the plate and the oil based colors are absorbed by the paper, giving richer color and vibrance.
The non-bitcoin website is here so you can see the price they usually sell for (and they sell fast) -

I used the first web browser and at worked and even at this initial stage it had a competitive advantage that overpowered its shortcomings. The first web experience was also amazing and at times slow but it made sense to use. What you get when you dont fix things in the beginning or have your user experience buttoned up initially is you get the Zune, Bing, minitel and all the other things that are obsolete now. This is not short sighted on my part but rather they took something that was working, like Bitcoin was a not so long ago and they took a path that will make another crypto come along and replace Bitcoin. LN is horribly thought out and a terrible user experience fro what I have seen so far and if this isnt completely redesigned it will make Bitcoin the AOL of cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 23:56:27
I remember when that happened, I live in France and work very often in Switzerland. Yeah it was a big adjustment. Well it seems like everyone is looking at the value of Bitcoin against the dollar or the euro, shouldnt things start to be priced natively in Bitcoin rather than getting an invoice and then getting the conversion rate then paying in Bitcoin? If the USA would for example make Bitcoin illegal to possess or some other policy that would have massive impact on the Bitcoin exchange rate, isnt that kind of the same thing?
@_date: 2018-04-30 02:04:52
Not sure the LN is a scaling solution, from what I have seen so far and the way it is supposed to operate, it seems to be a horrible user experience and will not be able to compete against credit card payments or even PayPal. If Bitcoin is to be the cryptocurrency that will truly allow people to be their own bank, another solution besides LN needs to be created or change LN entirely. For me there isnt a progression process as much as a cryptocurrency to be taken seriously needs to have a competitive advantage   right away against credit cards and PayPal at the very least. People are already resistant to change so unless that competitive advantage is enough for adoption, its worthless except to a few people, in the same way pokemon cards are valuable.

If you think that Bitcoin with LN has anything even close to being adopted and used by the public then you are delusional. The merchant adoption is way lower than before, no one is at all using LN. Just because a few people use the network to shuffle Bitcoin around does not mean at all this is working. I used Bitcoin for transactions around the world and i have seen the everyday use of Bitcoin in major cities dry up from where it was before. Sorry this what I have seen in the real world experience, wish it wasnt the case but I also believe the public has heard of Bitcoin more now, and they have some as a get rich quick scheme. I think the price of Bitcoin is way over inflated and possibly being artificially pumped up with Tether. This price is going to end badly and quite soon. I am not alone in this thought either. Be careful, I dont think I am the one that is changing my reality to fit my will.

I can understand that the "be your own bank" aspect of Bitcoin is very important because of the chargeback issue and the you can have your privacy from the banks...if you look at a service like Gyft that sells gift cards for Bitcoin and PayPal / credit cards....it started off as mostly Bitcoin sales, but now they are dwarfed by credit card sales. I deal in art from several very well known artists, and move art that will be worth more than Bitcoin will be in a few years...people seem to think that just because they have Bitcoin and it is a great technology that it will be a good investment, Bitcoin can easily go back down to nearly worthless and stay there....nothing is a sure thing. I just came back  from a major art fair in London with 14 thousand people attending over a three day fair, there even was a Bitcoin ATM machine right at the fair in plain vie to see. The fair accepted Bitcoin to get into the show. I couldnt beg people to pay with Bitcoin, they would want to pay in cash and I would offer them 10 percent off if they converted their British Pounds into Bitcoin through the ATM machine and I would even help them. Not one person was remotely interested in doing this. I was the only person that ever used the Bitcoin ATM machine to convert my British Pounds to Bitcoin so I wouldnt need to exchange Pounds to Euro. Even in London or Paris, it is very rare to find places to spend Bitcoin except a handful of places. I think Bitcoin is potentially an amazing currency, but it is much better for uses on the Dark Web than for the average person...all the best in your webcam work, hope those gentlemen pay you what you deserve.

Its a total waste of a marketing budget...I think this money could be spent in a much better way that will have much more impact. Bitcoin has a long way to go before the general public will take it seriously as a currency and they need more developers to do make this happen.
@_date: 2015-02-22 09:47:37
Much depends on what you are selling. If you are trying to reach people that already have Bitcoin and are looking to spend it, you might be waiting a long time for that. A long while back somebody paid for two pizzas with Bitcoin back when Bitcoin was worth very little and when Bitcoin shot up to $1200 / Bitcoin, these two pizzas cost $7 million. This is important because there are plenty of people that believe that Bitcoin is going to be worth much much more than ever before in the next few years, so the idea of spending half a Bitcoin on anything else besides what will earn them more Bitcoin is not a wise move. So what you are selling should somehow earn them more Bitcoin either directly or indirectly. 
What has worked with me to drive Bitcoin sales has been to offer incredible deals for paying in Bitcoin. I am talking 40 percent off the price people pay when they pay with PayPal or credit card or cash. This way people that have never used Bitcoin before will get Bitcoin to be able to get the huge discount. They are basically getting the wholesale price, but this is how I can contribute to the Bitcoin community and develop the Bitcoin marketplace with something other than computer related goods and services. What is ironic is that the art that I sell has actually appreciated in price where Bitcoin has gone down in value against the dollar so the art has out performed Bitcoin.
So in short, offer a huge discount only for Bitcoin payments and get the value of a database of online buyers that use Bitcoin, this is worth more than the goods you are selling.
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:03:12
BitPay is a great company but I dont think their problem is getting merchants to start accepting Bitcoin, rather that there are not enough people in the general public that trust Bitcoin enough to transfer their hard earned dollars and euros int Bitcoin and then use those Bitcoin on everyday goods and services. I live in one of the biggest cities in the world and it is sad how few places will accept Bitcoin. Maybe one restaurant in the whole city....if there were people with Bitcoin wallets on their phones then merchants would have a reason to accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:49:15
True, Dogecoin sponsored a driver in NASCAR and now Dogecoin is doing awesome. The reasons one will have trouble marketing Bitcoin is because they need developers to correct some serious aspects of Bitcoin that makes people that dont want to take chances transferring their fiat currency into Bitcoin.

I have helped other Swiss companies do exactly what you are asking to do...set up an account with Bitpay and get your limits raised by having your business documents in order and send to Bitpay. Their e-commerce platform needs to be improved a little but they are solid in what they do. One thing I wish they would fix is that if you add something to a shopping cart and then go back to shopping and then decide that you are just buying what you have, Bitpay doesnt have something as simple as go to shopping cart without adding something again to the cart and then deleting the item from the cart. I hope they fix this simple problem.

I still believe Bitcoin has great possibilities but a few issues really bother me about the current state of Bitcoin...first being that when an exchange gets hacked or goes down or if a wallet on a computer gets hacked...the currency / Bitcoin is gone and there is nothing you can do about it. The general public are not going to take a chance putting their life savings into a technology where there money can be robbed out of nowhere or they made a mistake with a decimal point when sending a Bitcoin payment and they sent 10 times the amount that they meant to....Also, paper wallets and all the other confusing aspects of Bitcoin either need to be made idiot proof and simple for the everyday person and not be so intimidating for no computer savvy people to understand. Right now Bitcoin is still a mystery to the majority of people.
Plus I think this story where the guy spent 6 million dollars on two pizza using Bitcoin makes everyone feel like they should only save Bitcoin and never spend it unless it is to buy more Bitcoin or to buy miners to mine more Bitcoin. The reason the Internet succeeded was because the general public had content they wanted to have and used it everyday. I get Bitcoin and I spend all the Bitcoin I get on non computer related &amp; non-geek goods and services and never use to buy gift cards. If the Bitcoin community doesnt understand this by now seeing the current price of Bitcoin, then it will get replaced by another cryptocurrency that people will use. I dont mine Bitcoin, I sell goods to people outside of the Bitcoin community hoping that they will seek out Bitcoin and get used to using it...when your sister or Mom use Bitcoin to get great discounts on things they buy then Bitcoin will have a chance...otherwise you will see Bitcoin go down to under 100 Dollars by the end of this year. I am hoping that Bitcoin developers are hired to fix the big issues and that people start using Bitcoin liek what it is supposed to be...a currency.

I am a big believer in the potential of Bitcoin but I can easily see Bitcoin becoming obsolete in the next few years and replaced with another cryptocurrency...to think that Bitcoin's bright future is set in stone is insane. I remember people buying stock in Netscape and Silicon Graphics thinking that these stocks were going to make them rich but things really didnt turn out that way. I can see plenty of flaws in Bitcoin and barriers to adoption by the general public because of risk and other issues. The work is in getting people to adopt and use this new technology or Bitcoin will be the next Minitel...
