Matter of fact their security is way more better and way too impressive than a lot of official released wallets and I do agree with you 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:46:42
exactly ! 
people started to buy it thinking of it as an investment or a fast way to make money or just store it to as an "Electronic treasury System" somehow.

I totally agree with you, but it is a great for securing the early transactions but what about the new transactions which take forever in the Mempool to get confirmed? And I still don't understand something here because it seems like miners are the reason behind such a high fees

thank you so much, I know about it bitcoin since 2015 but I wasn't able to afford it but the feeling of living on this society and have some of it is so priceless 
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:35:58
I tried it out today but it seems like credit card deposits are unavailable due to a system upgrade 
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:02:11
At least I can HODL them ;) 
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:23:41
Took you 8 years to get interested in bitcoin, not bad tho! 
But yeah check any bitcoin exchange and get familiar with it, but if you want to purchase a small amount to give it a try then you might want to pass by [CoinBase] ( or [CEX.IO] ( and buy some bitcoins using your Credit card 
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:07:30
Honestly I'm using a prepaid visa card and it works perfect, and for verification they gonna as you to provide a picture of yourself holding the card

Well don't you the whole point of rewarding miners is to encourage them to include the transactions into the Blockchain? I might don't understand it well but what's the point of rewarding them for mining an empty blocks? And please correct me if I'm wrong so I can understand 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:23:30
Yeah that's true I just checked it but If your android phone is encrypted with passphrase or fingerprint then you also have your apps locked and can only be unlocked with either your passphrase or fingerprint, but in general a passphrase is considered a better security than a fingerprint, but anyway sorry for not be useful

Your BCH is shit

Get yourself a bitcoin debt card, and some cards might have a high fees but it's still cheaper than coinbase 
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:29:05
I had a great experience with cex.io for buying bitcoins with visa/mastercard no ID required and all what you have to do is verify you're the owner of that visa/mastercard by providing a picture of yourself holding the card, and the only down side is the minimum amount of deposit is 20$ plus 3.5% + 0.25$
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:05:10
I want in

when it comes to bitcoin it's always never too late
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:58:47
it won't matter, **Bitcoin** was designed to be ran by people so the people who gave it it's value and beside that **Bitcoin** have so many features that make it most lovable by a majority of people. otherwise it will end up ignored like many other crypto currencies
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:04:22
Man congrats to you, unfortunately I can't use coinbase because it's not available in my country yet
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:36:43
Jihan is that you?? 
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:17:26
I use [CEX.IO]( for getting a small amount of bitcoin !
all what you need to do is verify your visa card ownership and that's it, they take only 3.5% + 0.25$ fees
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:30:22
skyrocket baby

is your news source is legit ? 
and if it was then that's going to make a whole new level of bitcoin trading in Ukraine and going to make it's economy more stable despite of the USD price comparing to the UAH
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:10:47
lol about that vision who knows !
but to be honest UAE had a bitcoin ATM way before and I bought from there my first bitcoins ever back in 2014 but somehow they got disappeared now.  and speaking of this ATM in Jubail for such a high fees 10-15% i don't know if it's worth it but somehow still cheaper than buying from localbitcoin.com because it seems like everyone who's trading bitcoin in Saudi Arabia just want an immediate profit despite of the market price
