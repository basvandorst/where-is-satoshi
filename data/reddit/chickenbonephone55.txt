Cryptorover makes a good point. As well, it's not that wealth inequality is a bad thing in and of itself, it's the amount of it and the ability to move out of it if one so desires. 
You're basically (loosely stated here) saying that wells for water aren't a bad thing. Yeah, no shit! But, if you fall into one that's too deep or when no one is around you to help, then you're fucked and dead and so is your whole family much of the time.

In so many words he's admitting that "their" system is hacked, as well. There are levels of security or a spectrum and he doesn't seem to connect the dots that "his" system is just as vulnerable, if not wildly more so.

Along with Bitcoin and other "blockchain technology" apps, we need to transition to a better system of voting and leadership procurement, so-to-speak. The polar, "choose only *one* person/party out these two choices" - aka plurality/first-past-the-post voting is not working. It's a stupid way to elect government. It's out-dated. It's not worthy of the people's dignity or practically any candidate's dignity... in their right mind. 
[Ranged-approval]( voting is where we need to look and move towards. There are no [other]( voting systems that compare. We can help many of our problems by getting *more than two _viable_ perspectives/parties/organizations* into the [mix]( - from there, the dominoes will fall. 
Such polar, extreme "choices" of the two-party system have festered, have tainted everything from media to the justice system to banking to basic government itself. We have a stately [path]( where "blockchain technology/Bitcoin" and Ranged-Approval voting is the [future](
