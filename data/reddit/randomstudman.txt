If anyone is reading this I would stop doing any business with Coinbase. I sent them a wire transfer almost 2 months ago and I have never received my money. Here is a list of things I have done this far. 
Made a support ticket.
Called customer support about 6 times only got through to a person 2 times.
Both times I got through I was told my issue would either be escalated or moved into the central stream. In other words not resolved.
I have emailed Coinbase customer support and wire support.
I have mailed a handwritten letter to the CEO Brian Armstrong.
I have contacted every Coinbase employee I could find on Reddit.
You want to know what I have gotten from all this time a effort... nothing.
Coinbase at this point has stolen my money and I am far from the only one over a grand gone.
I have given them until the 18th of this month so I can say I have tried every solution possible to get my money back. At this point soon as the 19th rolls around I am sending letters off to senators, representatives, the California state attorney general and every financial regulating body I can find all I need to do is print 10 pages of complaints from this subreddit. For all these people to see I am not the only one Coinbase has stolen from.
Please learn from me stay away from Coinbase this is just the latest news that Coinbase should not be allowed to handle other peoples money.
Oh and if any employees try to say just give us your support ticket number here it is Case ID:* 3052219. I know it won't do any good at this point all I want is for everyone to learn from my mistake. Don't ever do business with Coinbase. They have burned so many people don't become a coinbase victim. Please please please use any other exchange. Coinbase can't be trusted.
