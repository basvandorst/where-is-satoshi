That could have been part of a plea deal though... I have to imagine if he were innocent of that, then appealing those charges would have been a cake walk and the whole case would have been dismissed on grounds of perjury on the behalf of the prosecution.

I didn’t know about him putting out hits on people.

Are you fucked in the head? CP psychologically damages the children being abused, and it’s fucking disgusting... 
And there’s plenty of ways, how do you think arms dealers move and advertise their products? You think people get away with selling lbs. of heroin online but not guns?

But if they were smart, they would have left the original Silk Road continuing to operate and just busted people selling on the site, I don’t think the creators or mods deserved harsher sentences than people selling meth or heroin, just because they know how to run a dark web service.

You were questioning the legality of child pornography, I can read just fine.

Well, I guess that’s where you and I would contradict ourselves, because while I agree in this context, there are also people doing the exact same thing selling CP, murder services, and guns on the dark web as well.

Yes and no. Yes, because obviously the first guy got fucked hard without lube; No, because this is their message to any would-be future internet drug kingpins that they can do what they want and you’re at their mercy.

I would say they still are, they provide networking and app development for a wide range of companies. My dad works for them and he travels fucking everywhere all the time as a account systems engineer.
