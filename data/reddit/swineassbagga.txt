Im storing it in my coinbase account but have been thinking I should move it offline?  Any recommendations?  I haven't looked into how that works yet...

You're smart for that. Where are you? I'm in California...probably couldn't buy a shitshack for under 100.  Well I shouldn't say that, but it would be the most supreme shittiest of shacks ever. My first place was a dump and it cost 212! Ha. Made some good coin on it though, bought after the crash and sold for top dollar.

Having enough money to simply pay off your mortgage or buy a house cash will set you up for life. I purchased a house for 305K and put down 20% to avoid mortgage insurance and have good credit and my payment is still 1,600/month for the next 30 years of my life. My household income is around 90k but If I could eliminate that, I would be rich.

I've never thought about it like before. When you really start looking at the numbers the odds seem staggering, but that's why Andreas always discourages investing beyond your means and I've always respected that in him. There are clearly a lot of people with a large stake in Bitcoin who really really want it to get huge, but everyone seems to be very honest and open about both its potential and shortcomings. How refreshing

Hello, kind lad. You truly are a gentleman and a scholar!

Behind every great man is a tasteless woman who loves his depressing fleet vehicle.  As described in the add, "...with the 2.4 Liter 173 Hp it guarantees a fun drive!"  I wonder if anyone will be on the fence about buying it until they read that.  
Should read, "A census takers DREAM!!"

ha wow definitely behind on this one.  My wife usually pays our Dish bill but her dad was diagnosed with brain cancer last year and has recently taken a turn for the worst so needless to say things have been a little hectic. Staying on top of Bitcoin news couldn't be less of a priority.
