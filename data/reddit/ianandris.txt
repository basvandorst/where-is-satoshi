First of all, blockstream can't unilaterally increase block size. You've been decieved if you think that's how this works. Secondly, I'm glad the consensus has continued to be that small blocks are preferable. Bitcoin is first, foremost, and fundamentally about security and decentralization is vital to that. There simply isn't another coin in existance that is more secure than bitcoin is. If you don't understand why that's important or if you think the emphasis needs to be on bells and whistles instead of making a store of value impregnable you're in the wrong coin. There are thousands of cryptos out there that will fit that bill for you. Buy them instead.

Its kinda cyclic. Bitcoin has insane runs,  the market turns bearish, weak hands shake out and it crashes down a bit. But crypto is WAY too interesting/lucrative to ignore for long so a chunk of new investors start sniffing around and move back into alts which post crazy gains. With that newfound wealth, alt purchasers, some of whom initially wanted to get into bitcoin but were priced out, diversify into BTC, people see upward movement, bitcoin grabs headlines again bringing in new weak hands, some of whom will become strong hands. Alt traders don't want to miss out on bitcoin gains so they buy into it more and we get that sweet, sweet exponential bull, fed by steroidal media attention and the cycle repeats.

If. miners drop out the difficulty adjusts downward. Lower difficulty means lower barrier for entry to people who want to mine which leads to more people getting in the mining game which should help with decentralization. 
But, regardless, the reward for mining a block doesn't change until the halvening. Until then, sure, the fee rewards will adjust down but frankly they need to. Fingers crossed that the microtransactions and cheap AF fees help increase adoption, which will benefit everyone's in there long term.

I think you should probably get your information about what "leftists" believe from  people on the left, because what you described is wildly inaccurate at best. 
As a long time Bitcoin owning progressive, none of what you described applies to me. I'm fine with private property, I'm in favor of competitive free markets, but I'm also in favor of a strong social safety net supported by the constitutionally mandated power of taxation. 
I like Bitcoin for the same reason I like guns; as a hedge against tyrrany. Just like with guns, I expect I'll never need to use it for that purpose, but it's just an added layer of personal security, you know? If shit hits the fan domestically, crypto offers a means to take some of my wealth with me if I am forced to become a refugee. 
I'm progressive not because I'm ideologically rigid, but because I'm in favor of policies which support  a healthy society.  That is, policies which produce outcomes that decrease suffering as much as possible,  and provide the most Americans with a better standard of living and the capacity/ability to improve their status.

It's basic math dude. 
Will it help the economy? Lolno, but there's room for debate there, at least. What you cannot debate is that those "tax savings" are going to increase the national debt. That's one of the reasons they were passed. The national debt is propaganda fuel for entitlement reform.

1. It's definitely cheaper and faster that traditional settlement systems. Maybe not ideal for transcribing your daily coffee for all eternity, but certainly cheap and fast of you're moving significant sums of Bitcoin, and with LN it'll be even cheaper and faster. 
2. Miners and exchanges have significant influence, sure, but they absolutely do not control it. It's a global decentralized protocol. Also, for the record, influence and control are not at all the same thing. This, btw, carries over to the next point. 
3. There is no central planner. I will definitely concede that this isn't really a strong point since every piece of software or there has people developing our and they could absolutely be considered central planners. I think the point he's speaking to is more de jure control over the planning and execution of that plan. The closest thing would be whoever has the ability to commit changes to the core software. BUT, that all comes with the caveat that if people en masse got sick of the direction of was headed, they could immediately fork off and take things a different direction. Economic consensus means if you don't like the "planners" you can pick a different team, different protocol which supports his point that there is no central planning authority. 
4. I'm divided about his last statement. I absolutely agree that there isn't NO market for a less secure Bitcoin. There are, however, markets for what ETH (smart contracts dapps, etc) and XMR (extreme focus on privacy and anonymity) and other coins are doing which relegate absolute security concerns to a secondary status, but he's correct that none of those coins would have spontaneously emerged without Bitcoin having blazed that trail. Much of the tremendous innovation occurring in this space is all reliant on the Bitcoin experiment succeeding. Perspective: if Bitcoin were to fail, and I mean fail as in cease to work, core protocol problems rendering the experiment unsuccessful; I do not mean fail as in to become valueless, or for another coin to become more valuable; the rest of the crypto economy would be utterly devastated since so much of what they base their work on is Bitcoin. This is becoming less true over time, but it's still very much true.

Could be using a service like coinbase or something that doesn't have you settle transactions between wallets on the same service directly on chain, so they avoid tx fees and confirmation times are irrelevant. 
Edit: those kind of services btw, are why I think the confirmation time problems/expensive fees are a wildly overblown issue. Its good practice to have a hot wallet for spending money and a cold wallet for storage away from third party intermediary services. Looking forward to LN so that same paradigm doesn't require the intermediary.

I think you're misunderstanding what Bitcoin is by comparing it directly to the role of fiat in a national monetary system. 
Bitcoin is more of a commodity than a currency, IMO. A very real digitally native asset. It's primary value proposition is that it can be exchanged person to person *like* cash anywhere in the world as a means of settlement that exists outside of every national monetary system. It's the ultimate uncorrelated asset. 
Bitcoin should never ever be a national currency. It's not suited to the purpose, but the value of a system like Bitcoin is obvious, and if your conclusion is that it's worth 0 I can only submit that you're missing the point.

There's a brave new world of use cases that the world is slowly waking up to. My metrics: 1. is the tech disruptive? 2. Is the coin being actively developed by reputable individuals? 3. Does it solve a problem or improve on a process? 4. Is it open source and not premined? 5. Can its tech advancements be rolled into/pegged to bitcoin? 
Those criteria will eliminate a bunch of dreck, leaving you with a decent selection of coins that may or may not take off, but honestly you only need one or two bets to pan out at this stage.
Its a global market, a young market, and it isn't being spearheaded by the old guard *or* primarily the west. There's no doubt in my mind that crypto will change finance top to bottom.

Crypto is developing a rep for being uncorrelated to the stock market. SP just hit a new ATH, chances are some investors wanted to reallocate to stocks away from crypto given the recent volatile sideways movement. The Fed talking about dropping interest rates means more hot air into the balloon and likely new ATH in the stock market is a safer bet than crypto’s wild ride.
That’s my guess anyway.

Not an engineer, but from what I understand;
Mining is inherently competitive. Since new bitcoin is awarded to the miner who solves the hash first, miners who have more powerful equipment that can hash more quickly are at an advantage. The end result is a hardware arms race between miners and the creation of pools which are essentially cloud mining farms. 
The network adjusts hash difficulty based in part on the speed that blocks are added to the blockchain with the aim to add them every 10 minutes. This means as more computational power is added to the network, the harder it is for blocks to be added with existing equipment because of the difficulty adjustment. 
Hash power is added to and subtracted from the network based on miners calculations about profitability. As bitcoin increases in value, so does the viability of mining, so you see more hash power come online. This, btw, means that in order to be competitive in an enterprise mining environment, you probably need to have excess hash power offline and available for when the price increases. Since you have no way of knowing how much your competition has available, there’s a pretty constant pressure to acquire additional hash power. 
There are entire factories out there that crank out hash power daily in the form of ASICs. This, btw, means that *real industry* is the backbone of and being supported by the bitcoin network.
The hashing mechanism is what *secures the bitcoin network* and is essentially the whole reason crypto is called crypto. The myriad failed guesses that happen as a result of the difficulty adjustment actually make it harder for bad actors to take control of the network with anything less than a significant, practically impossible, investment *in* the security of the network. Its a pretty clever system based on pure competition. 
Ultimately, its a race and the fastest guesser wins. Is it wasteful? Not at all, since the only way the network stays secure is if people invest in the hardware to process transactions on the network. Those failed guesses make it so people have to invest in the hardware. 
Is it perfectly *efficient*? No. But it is more efficient than the aggregate energy use of banks worldwide. 
Even so, bitcoin still only accounts for like, %0.2 of global energy use.

Italics for emphasis. To be frank, if you’re the kind of person vulnerable to phishing attempts, bitcoin *may* not be the best fit. Bitcoin demands a certain degree of security consciousness that some people are just going to struggle with.

I’ve posted something similar elsewhere, but there are a lot of true believers on this sub who seriously hate on people who use a third party custodial service to protect their bitcoin. They throw around the “not your keys, not your coin” mantra like its gospel but they seriously downplay risk inherent to maintaining personal control of your keys. Acts of god, theft, incompetence are all very serious risks that an individual would need to manage when maintaining positive control of his keys, and its honesy not always wise to take on that responsibility. 
And that’s fine. 
Coinbase isn’t perfect by any stretch, but they are a silicon valley company who runs an institutional grade custodial service. They’re also fully insured against loss due to their security practices, so if you aren’t buying bitcoin for ideological reasons, it’s probably safer to let them handle the security than it is to bother with it yourself, tbh. 
People around here get seriously dogmatic about bitcoin, but at the end of the day its all risk management and acceptable risk will depend on your individual circumstances. DYOR includes checking out companies in the space and Coinbase, frankly, is no Mt Gox.

Considering they are a silicon valley company who runs an institutional custodial service for storing crypto, it’s actually one of the safer ways to do it. The risk with Coinbase is less hacking and more regulatory, IMO. Coinbase will comply with the law, and if CA or DC decide to confiscate crypto in general for whatever reason, you *will* lose your keys. 
But its actually safer than keeping it yourself in some respects. People here downplay the risks associated with maintaining personal control of your keys. If you lose your hardware wallet or seed phrases, your crypto is *gone*. This can happen because of theft, fire, flood, personal incompetence, or a ton of other reasons, all of which are risks that would need to be individually taken into account based on your circumstances. Storing keys in a safety deposit box is doable, but at that point you’re still relying on a custodial service. 
Not everyone needs to be or should be their own bank, tbh. 
But that said, when people say “not your keys, not your coin”, they are completely correct. You just have to decide for yourself if you’re willing to take on the risk of personal positive control of your keys.

Okay, so you're literally engaging in the behavior I was talking about. LN, schnorr, mast, MimbleWimble, etc are all acknowledgement that there are issues with the way the network is functioning. The scaling issue is real, but it's being dealt with and it's being dealt with in a way that doesn't fundamentally threaten the decentralized nature of the coin. 
It isn't a "this is fine, everything is fine" in a burning house situation. The house isn't burning at all. It's more like the house is under construction and we haven't got the front stairs built yet and the garage is full of tools so we have to go around back to get in. But, rest assured, the stairs are on the way and it's still a kickass, livable, extremely secure house. 
Even so, the fundamental argument you're making is that the high fees are making the product useless and the only reasonable solution to make it useful is to switch to ditch it and switch to a different block chain. But the product isn't useless. It isn't ideal for small transactions atm, but *right now* is working as a pretty swell store of value. it's in incredibly high demand. It's still the bell whether of the crypto space and it's still the most active community. I'm not knocking ETH, not ignoring the awesome stuff happening over there. I own some. But they are different beasts.
As far as Venezuelan crypto use is concerned: you may speculate that Bitcoin is useless for them, but it's a ridiculous statement to make when they're obviously piling into it. I don't dispute that other coins may be more practical from a low value day to day transaction standpoint at this point in time, but the arguments against ignore that Bitcoin *is* working, and it's working for Venezuelans. Transactions are being made. Bitcoin is still a great store of value, is in high demand, and it's future is bright, too. A far cry from a burning house. 
Hell, I don't even care if bcash carves out a successful niche. There's plenty of room at the top. I'm simply chafing at the obvious and unwarranted hostility toward Bitcoin proper. 
Again, that's not disputing that Bitcoin is undergoing some growing pains. I've been in the space since 2013, there have been a whole lot of them and we've got plenty more to come. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:41:53
Almost objectively wrong? Not even close. 
 I'm sure Venezuelans have their hands on all sorts of different coins, but what good sense does it make to ignore the, by far, largest most valuable coin network with the most name recognition in favor of a smaller coin which may or may not have more utility?
Look, I'm all for innovation in crypto. I have a crypto portfolio beyond Bitcoin and I'm always keeping my ear to the ground for anything disruptive with a compelling, valid use case. What bothers me is the obnoxious dismissive attitude I see from alt coin fan boys who think that because their favorite coin does some things better than Bitcoin that it's obvious Bitcoin is useless/doomed to fail/obsolete tech.
It's horseshit. Bitcoin developers are *the best* at what they do. Name a single programming team that would turn away a core developer because they aren't good enough. That isn't a comment on other development teams, either. Bitcoin remains the beating  heart of the crypto universe. If Bitcoin falters, they all falter. Bitcoin is the crypto reserve currency, like it or not. The scaling issues is dealing with would be suffered by any coin network of its size. There are solutions in the pipeline and they are *routinely* ignored by altcoiners. It's coming. Which makes the appeal to utility argument absolutely absurd when discussing other coins.  Is Monero a superior product compared to Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions? How about Ethereum vs MAST? What about schnorr signatures, MimbleWimble? Why are those solutions routinely ignored when talking about Bitcoin?
Is it the time frame? Bitcoin will work better in the future, but this coin works fine *now*? Is that really justification enough for people who have money in Bitcoin to put it in a less trusted, lesser known alt? Everyone has an answer of their own, but for places with rapidly inflationary currency, it would seem the answer is "not really". Good money drives out bad. Best money drives out better money. It's telling that despite alternatives floating around for years, Bitcoin continues to reign supreme.
Case in point: when Steam decided to stop accepting Bitcoin payments, did they go with another coin? Or did they, correctly, determine that crypto currencies are still a work in progress and the ecosystem is not mature enough to warrant the amount of time and energy they were spending on support for crypto users?
It took 9 years for Bitcoin to get to its current valuation. That's 9 years of constant development, innovation, and up time. No other coin comes close. That's not to say Monero, Ethereum, Stellar Lumens, poss IOTA, Litecoin and others aren't great software that deserve a piece of the pie, but it gets old to see so many people simply gloss over what made Bitcoin the juggernaut it is in favor of the newest toy with their preferred features. 
Bitcoin isn't here by accident. It Wasn't serendipity, it wasn't luck or just the first mover advantage though I'm sure all of those had a hand at some point or another. The reason Bitcoin is still king is because it's developers are laser focused on creating the single most secure, immutable digital asset that they possibly can create. The best form of money this planet had seen. When it comes to the revolution that is crypto currency, there is no more important development goal.

Kinda. My understanding is, yes, you open a channel with a budgeted amount of Bitcoin,  and all transactions on the lightning network stay on the network until the channel is closed. The transactions are very real, the coins are just stored off chain in multi Sig wallet so they don't incur settlement fees on the blockchain until channels are closed. 
Basically, the paradigm of the cold wallet and hot wallet (savings and checking) will carry over, except the hot wallet will be a LN wallet. My guess is eventually most of the Bitcoin transactions that will take place will be on LN, settling to the blockchain when channels open or close.

Bitcoin provides many of the services a bank provides, but without any of the overhead. That's no salary, no rent, no maintenance, no boundaries, no property taxes, no lawyers, no liability, no executives, no customer service, no surprises. Bitcoin has automated those processes and externalized the costs to miners, who are incentivized to pay them because the protocol rewards them very well for participating in that vital role. If you own Bitcoin, you own a piece of the first internet native bank. A piece you can trade *like a currency in a perfectly secure way, digitally*. You tell me what a single share of a bank like that would be worth, then maybe we have a starting point to talk about current value.

Buying all the available Bitcoin would cause the prices to skyrocket as sell walls are cleared out, and shorts would be squeezed to hell magnifying that effect. They could tank it by dumping a huge portion of the asset, sure, but they have to hold the asset first. Futures alone aren't going to make much of a difference especially since they're cash settled. 
The question them is how much of the run up and dump was institutional and how much was retail adoption? My suspicion is a combination, but those coinbase sign up numbers tell a story, you know?

First of all, doing beat yourself up.  most of USD in this space have taken a haircut a time or two and it's just how you learn, you know? It's a good lesson in understanding there limits of your competence and it's a lesson we all relearn throughout the years, hopefully more infrequently as time goes on. It's almost a right of passage. Congrats! You are not a day trader just like the majority of us. So unless you're going to spend years learning the ins and outs of charts, time to embrace the strong hand. Research and hold that shit. Remember: time in the market is better than timing the market. 
Secondly, never invest more than you can afford to lose. You're sick because you were overexposed. Don't be overexposed. 
Third: money is easy come easy go. When your paradigm is one of labor, exchanging work for money, that reality can be obfuscated, but if you're aware that opportunities come and go you'll be okay. There's always something else and if you're looking for opportunities and acceptable risks you'll spot them. Just have to beer patient. There WILL be more money in your life and it WILL go away as quickly as it comes. So don't sweat too hard. Don't grip too hard and don't let the lesson you take from this be fear of losing money. Let it be fear of incompetence. 
As long as you learn, you're coming out ahead.

Stock is equity in a company. 
Bitcoin is something else entirely.  rather than owning an equity stake in a business, you actually just control cryptographic private keys to an entry on the blockchain that contains a balance of Bitcoin. Think of the blockchain like a huge apartment complex owned by everyone and noone. When you're buying Bitcoin, you're buying square footage in the apartment. The apartment has a public address, but only you have the key to get in. If you lose the keys, the apartment is permanently inaccessible. If you trust the keys to a third party, you can still access it but so can they and they can choose to lock you out.

I got in just before the 2013 bubble. The advice I got that tipped me into the market was simple. If you aren't a day trader, don't trade. If you did your research and you believe in the tech, pick a time frame that you'll hold for no matter what and stick to it. Mine is 10 years or when I can but a house with it, whichever happens first. Volatility is going to happen. Your investment could go to zero and if you aren't comfortable with that, don't invest. 
But if you've done your research, understand and believe in the tech, and you're buying because you think it'll go up and change the world along the way, waiting for the price to drop doesn't make sense. If you think it'll be worth more in 5 years than it is now, waiting is like playing chicken with a freight train.
If you're buying because of FOMO, don't freaking buy. 
Point is : do your homework. Understand Bitcoin. Understand what it has the capacity to do. Understand it's historical significance. Otherwise you might as well buy a scratch off lottery ticket because you'll probably lose money by cashing out during the inevitable and frequent contractions corrections and dips. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:43:14
They're mostly fudding. Futures have been available for years now, just not on wall street. Fact is wall street futures aren't really going to move the spot price their own, either. You need to hold a huge amount of the asset in order to move the spot price and it's hard to say if institutions have been buying the kind of amount of Bitcoin needed to do that. It's probable/likely that some of them are carving out a position for themselves but the amounts they are looking at aren't going to be bought retail and they probably aren't going to hold them on their own, either, which means the coins may not even move. Thus Coinbase rolling out it's custodial service, etc. 
Point is it's complicated, noone really knows how they're going to affect the price and anyone raising nothing but red flags is blowing smoke up your ass either intentionally or because they're full of hot air.

There's no question that there is a fee problem, but it is being worked on. I think one of the biggest problems with bitcoin is that its been *too* successful. I mean, what's the latest core release? 0.15.1? That's some way off from 1.0. There is an enormous amount of work left to be done on the software that *is* Bitcoin. Its being done. It doesn't happen overnight.
But its popularity is a stress test in its own right. The more valuable it gets, the more demonstrable it is that a piece of software can retain and transfer real value without the involvement of a third party intermediary. This, btw, is the fundamental value proposition of bitcoin, and its a thing it continues to do exceedingly well. 
Obviously, infrastructure is in its infancy as much as the core codebase is, but the problems are being worked on, they will be solved, and in the meantime there is a whole world of crypto out there experimenting with the notion of trustless transfer of value. 
Big businesses and governments everywhere see the value in blockchain solutions. Many of them question the value of bitcoin, but bitcoin is, essentially, proof of concept. Its more akin to linux than it is the dollar, imo.

I would guess most wallets would basically have to develop a standard feature set with a familiar paradigm like a checking and savings account.

No paper no USD. No ink no USD. 
Wifi and electricity aren't going anywhere, neither are the paper and ink industry. The dollar may be more useful in crisis situations but that's an absurd worst case scenario. Puerto Rico had internet. LONG before they had full power restored (still not there btw. They still have internet). Even so, entertaining your poor reasoning, can you change those USD into 24 words that will secure your wealth until after the disruption ends provided a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain exists somewhere in the world when the power and internet get turned back on? No. No you can't. 
If it never comes back on and it's worldwide disruption your dollars and paper gold aren't going to be much use for you either. 
Also, there have been shitcoins alts and copycats since the white paper was released. Some are still here, most have faded into nothing. The ones that stick around have done so because they found a niche. Bring on Disney coin, PayPal coin, your mother's vagina coin. The market is completely open. Let's see how they do. Bitcoin doesn't care if visa coin decides to run a centralized digital token piggybacking on the crypto wave. it's still not Bitcoin and is you can't differentiate between them you obviously have no idea what you're talking about.

Per question one, I would assume that is a problem that a wallet dev would be keenly focused on. I'm not one. What are the issues with developing software for "wallet amount management"? 
Per your second question... what? Like I mentioned, I'm not a dev of any kind, but from the stuff I read, I got the sense that opening a channel is basically a thing that happens under the lightning network protocol when both parties agree to open a multi sig wallet with whatever sum is acceptable to both parties. How would you be able to open a channel with someone without the BTC available?

Then again, there's a good chance people who own shorts on nasdaq and cme will get utterly rekt which could cause an even more exaggerated upward price movement since that same liquidity enabling the shorts will have to buy long to average out their position, but given noone seems to be able to explain exactly what bitcoin is *worth* its looking like the kind of gamble that ends with honey badger getting that honey.

Interesting thing, too, is that the price of gold seems largely unaffected which means it's mostly new people coming into the market that are driving the price. People aren't divesting from their gold en mass to buy Bitcoin. If that does stay to happen I think that's when I think we start pushing multiple hundreds of thousands. 
That said, I also think people on this sub, new people in particular, tend to look at Bitcoin through the lens of American markets, forgetting this is a truly global phenomenon. The scale is huge, the trading never stops, and FUD doesn't travel as well across borders as Bitcoin itself does. I think there's plenty of room for the price to run up, but it won't start getting massive until it begins eating the lunch of other asset classes and there's no reason to think it can't do that. 
I really do think it has the potential to be 400k within 5years. Wouldn't surprise me to see it higher.

Waiting for assets to moon is why people invest in 401ks or buy stocks. That people are putting money in crypto instead of buying into hedge funds or stocks is what disruption *looks like*. Sitting on money is one of the primary functions of a bank. Checking accounts et al. are services intended to get people to deposit their money with the banks so they can lend it out. Bitcoin is my savings account. So far, is kicking the shit out of traditional banking services at both of those functions. 
Also, don't forget, Amazon started out selling books and Netflix was a DVD rental service. There's a ton of room fort innovation in this space in exactly the ways that Amazon and Netflix figured out the best way to use the new medium of the internet.

It's because you phrased your question confrontationally and from a fundamental lack of understanding about the tech. It didn't sound like an honest "help me understand this a bit better", it came across as a "so this is obviously centralized. Prove me wrong" which is a common tactic here among people who benefit from misinformation and degraded discourse on the sub. Antagonism nets you down votes.
Also, The comment I'm replying to isn't helping your case, either. First of all, you're whining about down votes which is just... don't do that. It's really petty. Secondly, you're accusing participants of the sub of "groupthink" simply because you don't understand why you got downvoted which is a shit way to conduct yourself. 
So, basically, you're getting downvoted because you came across like an asshole. Not an accusation, just an explanation.

Are you talking about price? Because as long as price is quoted in fiat there is no limit since fiat can be printed at any time for any reason.
I honestly think a few trillion is inevitable once LN is implemented,  segwit is released on there core wallet, and Bitcoin becomes a preferred method for significant economic activity. 
Depending on how things develop it could quite easily absorb portions of the gold market, bond market, real estate market, fine art and collectibles market, global M2 supply. No idea what the percentages it could capture are, but even assuming it's anywhere from 5-10 percent PDF each market you're looking at multiple trillions and hundreds of thousands of dollars in valuation.

I agree that pointing out what others do well isn't the same thing as open hostility to Bitcoin. I love emerging tech and systems and the solutions a lot of these coins have come up with are really cool. I don't assume hostility by default, but you'll have to forgive me for assuming hostility when you described Bitcoin using the burning house meme. It's inaccurate and the meaning is clear to pretty much everyone and it's intended to be a mockery.  Chase that with positive bcash notes and an obvious bias toward alts and against Bitcoin, and it comes across a lot like other commentors that are openly hostile to Bitcoin and the community. 
In any case, we're on the same page for the most part. I have no problem discussing Bitcoin flaws and the good qualities of other coins. I do get a bit frustrated when people talk about Bitcoin like the sky is falling because fees are "too damn high". while also refusing, willfully or no, to acknowledge that the issues are being worked.
Bitcoin is not a finished product. Of course we'll see how it all shakes out once layer 2 and other improvements are in place and being used. Until then, or would be awesome if people, while describing Bitcoin cons vs altcoiners strengths, didn't ignore the incredible development underway. 
As far as what situation was as bad as the fee situation? Hard to say off hand would have to look it up when I get home, but my opinion is that the fee situation isn't actually THAT bad. It's inconvenient and it's slowing adoption for retail use, but I mean, hell, were close to ATH and interest is insanely high.

It's absolutely censorship resistant once you have it, but obtaining it can be tough without supporting infrastructure. Hell is always been like that. When I first heard about it in 2010 I was going to throw 100 bucks at it in case it became valuable, but the only way to get it was mining. Since I like to be lazy in my down time, I gave up and didn't get around to buying until years later once it was easier. 
But the fact is even without an exchange, I could have acquired it if I was willing to put in the effort.   Same for people who live under oppressive regimes. IIRC, Bitcoin is illegal in Venezuela, but that isn't stopping people from obtaining and using it.

Yes. Shills have been a fact of life on the internet for a number of years now. Bcash shills have been obvious for a while. I'm a bit more dubious of banking shills being present here, since I get the sense that the vast majority of banks are still trying to come up with a strategy for bitcoin. They still don't know exactly what to make of it, so shilling isn't a productive enterprise.

It'll spur adoption by making Bitcoin suitable for small purchases and it will essentially unlock the possibility for microtransactions. It will ramp up the tx per second to many thousands per second.  It's not hypothetical, it's already rolled out on litecoin iirc and ethereum is also doing something similar with raiden network, so it really is a matter of time before we see it on Bitcoin. Will definitely happen within the next year or two.

For the uninitiated:
Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Of course it's IP. Bitcoin is a software protocol, licensed as FOSS. Can't exactly license software that way if it's not intellectual property. The protocol as designed by Satoshi Nakamoto is IP. It's IP from top to bottom. Maybe your brother is smarter than you. Who knows? 
In any case, you wonder about the value of the Bitcoin token, I submit that it's indistinguishable from the value of the IP and the very real investments people have made in infrastructure to support and propagate the network. I assure you, those investments were not made with unicorns.

Miners are payed by transaction fees.

More importantly, the lions share of incoming venture capital, open source development, etc is being allocated to bitcoin.

I agree it won’t be adopted en masse, but it is proving its use case. I actually heard an interview on my local NPR channel a couple weeks back about a Venezuelan economist who claimed it saved his family. Apparently, he would just use localbitcoins to change into fiat when he needed it. Bitcoin actually preserved his wealth. 
He also mentioned the Venezuelan government recently started pushing its own localbitcoin alternative which, naturally, he isn’t going to waste his time with, but it was nice to hear bitcoin discussed on mass media without the emphasis on price.
IIRC they also asked him why he didn’t leave, and he indicated that there’s a ton of opportunity there now because of the brain drain and hyper inflation. Could absolutely hear echoes of the bitcoin community in that answer. Very interesting perspective, imo.

It's exactly what's happening here. None is censoring them. Gab continues to operate. One business has decided to crease association with the platform because it is a cesspool of toxic speech. There is no government mandating that this happen. Free speech is not being inhibited. What's happening is the "free market" has decided that the kind of speech all over that isolated social media platform is problematic and it's disincentivizing it by breaking off association with the service. 
Free speech is a right but you supply don't get to choose the consequences of that speech. If you exercise your right by being a complete and total asshole, there's a good chance you'll be harmed by it because a right to free speech doesn't mean other people have to put up with it. 


You are going to need to source the hell out of those claims because thats exactly what propaganda looks like.

Nice red meat post. Here's why you're wrong. 
1. According to your poor reasoning, the dollar has inherent value because of the paper. I'm guessing this is because of everything goes to hell you can still wipe your ass with it or turn it into confetti or whatever. It's a physical good so it has that inherent value. Obviously, that's not why people own the dollar, but in your mind there's a floor because it's a physical thing. 
Well turns out that in order to interact with bitcoin, you need physical things, too. You need to access the network, you need electricity, and you need hardware. All of those things have varying degrees of "inherent" value and all of them are required for bitcoin. Turns out there is specialized physical hardware securing the network too, all of which required investment, work, and time to create. 
So, if the end of the world comes, you can still use the physical tool that allows you to interact with your bitcoin as a paper weight or a rock to throw at someone in self defense. I don't know about you, but at the end I think I'd  rather have the rock than the confetti. 
What I'm getting at is that you don't seem to understand what gives something value, but even according to your own reasoning, bitcoin would be worth more than the dollar. 
2. Not true either, but also completely irrelevant to its value. You're putting the cart WAY before the horse here.
3. Also off base. The were was a post just a little bit ago from someone off grid who finds the utility of bitcoin very appealing. There are plenty of people who use it every day for every day shit via a btc debit card. There are people who get their entire paychecks in btc. 
I saw the username so I assume this is likely a troll post, but it's fun to chew some red meat. Anyway, I disagree with practically everything you posted, but cheers and good luck.

I'm a "leftist" who has been following Bitcoin since like... 2010 ish. I understand what it's about pretty goddamn well. Sound money doesn't give a fuck about your political leanings and even the most strident "leftists" require units of account. Wealth, trade, and competition are not exclusively right wing concepts. If you can't see that you're ideologically blinded. The problem isn't that "leftists" are interested in Bitcoin and joining the conversation. We've been here since day one. It's that people are constantly seeking to politicize a fucking technology. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:05:55
Not really. There aren't many  traditional investment vehicles in the crypto world and frankly the hype around "block chain" minimizes the importance of individual block chains. 
Part of what makes bitcoin valuable is the fact that is tested, secure, and liquid in a way no other block chain is. It's the longest chain, and it's the entry/exit onto the crypto world. For better or worse, bitcoin is essentially the crypto reserve currency. 
That isn't to say another chain can't or won't supplant it at some point in the future but in order for that to happen there will have to be a compelling reason for mass migration to another chain. That would happen either because another product emerges that is clearly superior to bitcoin, or because there's a problem with bitcoin itself that somehow isn't a problem with other chains, too.

I know what you're talking about. I've read the comments in the thread. The argument you're making is an attempt to conflate a flawed social media platform with a revolutionary open source sound money protocol. 
Bitcoin was a response to catastrophic financial collapse brought about by the regulatory capture of the international monetary system. Bitcoin is built to be an alternative to a very real problem. Gab came to us because people didn't like it when told that their racist and/or inflammatory statements were racist and/or inflammatory so they stomped off and created their own community filled with people who are assholes or deluded into thinking community standards are a bad thing. Big difference. 
The thing with social networks is that they are, first and foremost, social, which means the community is what gives them value. PayPal deplatforming Gab is a statement of their view of what value that community has. 
The principles underpinning Bitcoin do not imply that toxic communities ought to be coddled by private enterprise. They do not suggest that private businesses be forced to give platform to anyone at all. The principles underpinning Bitcoin *do* suggest that those communities should continue to have the ability to conduct trade which, because of Bitcoin, they are perfectly capable of doing. 
If you're a libertarian outraged by this news, you probably aren't as libertarian as you think you are.

Lets not get ahead of ourselves. Yes bitcoin and crypto is a fascinating possibly revolutionary concept, but it's not a religion and is not going to suddenly save the world and yank everyone out of poverty. Bitcoin *can* help the unbanked, but being unbanked is often an infrastructure problem that isn't going to be addressed directly by a system that frankly relies on some fairly advanced infrastructure, and bitcoin definitely isn't going to teach anyone to read. 
Of course we need to improve ourselves and be community minded. This is important now more than ever considering the toxic political climates all over. But bitcoin is not a pancea for all the world's ills. It's just better money. Which is awesome. But it's just money.

If they loudly or arrogantly get it wrong they deserve to have egg on their faces and be roundly criticized or even, if one is so inclined, mocked.

@_date: 2017-08-16 12:03:43
Right, but that's the benefit of a stable altcoin. If bitcoin were to succumb to a 51 percent attack, it's likely that users would trade into another one with a different proof of work, rendering the hash power attacked bitcoin obsolete. (litecoin has positioned itself well as silver to bitcoin gold). Of course this would be incredibly disruptive but it wouldn't be the end of crypto, just the end of the dominance of bitcoin. 
Furthermore, it's doubtful the community wouldn't see it coming. Since a 51 percent attack is the primary threat to the crypto ecosystem, there is incentive to monitor the sources of hash power closely. While mining is still pretty centralized at the moment, you can bet that as bitcoin grows in value deep pockets aren't going to let their wealth come under direct threat and will invest in their own nodes.
Ultimately, though, the incentives just don't add up. If you've spent the cash and built the relationships needed to generate that kind of hash power, what good sense would it make to jeopardize your investment by plotting a 51 percent attack? Why would you bother? Especially if you're already invested in bitcoin, which you would undoubtedly be for your hashpower to be significant enough to jeopardize the network that way.
Imo, the main threat of a 51 percent attack would originate from a hostile nation state looking to actually destroy or supplant bitcoin. Russia jumping into the bitcoin mining game raises an alarm just a bit, considering, but truth be told I kinda think they simply want a different reserve currency than the USD and something like bitcoin holds promise. 
That, btw, isn't to say that bitcoin will ever supplant the USD but if I'm Russia, I'd definitely roll the dice on a tech like this just in case, you know? Not to mention that economies centered around energy production would stand to benefit from bitcoins seriously energy intensive mining process if it becomes an economically significant asset class.
Anyhow, my 2 cents is there's too much money to be made in a stable growing bitcoin for the people who can destroy it to bother doing so.
Doesn't mean it can't happen.

I grew up as a conservative. Hell, my first election, I voted for Bush. But as I got older, experienced life without a support network, did the military thing, etc, I realized that I was being sold a bill of goods, nothing of value. 
Would you like to understand why, or would you prefer to denigrate me for my beliefs, despite having no understanding *at all* of how I arrived at them or what circumstances led to my political ideation? Honest political debate. Go for it.

Honestly, you need to think of Bitcoin as a completely new asset class that shares some features of real estate, some features of a currency, and some features of securities. 
If you're wondering about the utility of bitcoin or its potential use cases, use the search function here or google it. Remember: the internet as an idea didn't have a profit model from the get go. People figured out how to monetize the platform over time.

You’re going to need to draw some cleaner lines than that. 
A few points of interest that spring to mind: Housing prices haven’t collapsed by 90% multiple times and recovered multiple times within the past decade. Also, the real estate market has more than completely recovered from 2008 (though I’m sure it’ll take a beating over the next few years). This isn’t true everywhere, btw, and that’s because real estate isn’t a fungible commodity/asset class like bitcoin. Furthermore, comparing bitcoin to oversold derivatives based on subprime mortgages that were effectively the bottom layer of the house of cards of global finance is just... well... it’s completely ridiculous. Banks aren’t selling mortgages to people for the purpose of speculating on bitcoin. It’s more like gold than real estate in that respect. Major difference being that there isn’t a bunch of paper bitcoin floating around.
Also, real estate is a 9T market. Bitcoin is like 200B? Its a drop in the bucket. 
In any case, if you’re simply making a comment on broader markets, I’m inclined to agree. There’s no question that a recession is incoming. I don’t really recall what happened to gold at the beginning of 2007/8, but I do remember it doing quite well after the initial shock. As of this comment we’re floating around 10.1k, could easily see it pulling back another 15-20 percent, but that’s also pretty typical for bitcoin. If you look at the run up to 2017, you saw that pattern repeatedly. 
The real question in my mind is what happens to bitcoin when everything else is getting crushed. My guess is some people will exit the market initially to cover their asses, but after that? No one really knows, but I’ve noticed bitcoin has a tendency to heavily exaggerate price movements in both directions. I imagine that quality would be incredibly attractive in a recession.

You’re entitled to your beliefs, but if your beliefs are fundamentally intolerant, a tolerant society cannot tolerate them. Intolerant belief systems, beliefs based on hate, have no compunction about eliminating tolerant elements of a society if they disagree with them. This presents an existential threat to a tolerant society. 
Hate speech may be protected speech, but there is no hypocrisy in refusing to put up with it, entertain it, or give it platform. It’s understandable that intolerant folk might feel persecuted by this, but what’s good for the goose is good for the gander. You push a system with intolerance as its foundation, you can’t be surprised when people push back just as hard or even harder if needed.
Everyone just wants a good life.

The realist in me can’t imagine the big kids don’t see the value in a stateless global monetary system that exists as an immutable, cryptographically secured, distributed ledger. It’s like a backup generator for global finance that’s still under active development. 
Also, consider the big kid reaction to Libra. The vocal and immediate blowback in an attempt to nip it in the bud speaks volumes. From what I can tell, the question of bitcoin is more one of “how can we integrate this in a way that works to our benefit and doesn’t make North Korea and some basement dwelling millennial kid masters of the universe”. The price action may be part of this, but volatility is attractive as hell for traders and bitcoin has had the shit kicked out of it for its entire lifespan. Not many are running for the exits. 
From here it looks like a land of no great options. If they play too hard, they make other people rich, if they leave it alone, they make other people rich. As painful as it might be, it may actually be a case of a rising tide lifting all boats. 
Plus, if data is one the most valuable resources we have, can you imagine a more valuable dataset than such a ledger? Data mining the blockchain has the potential to be incredibly lucrative. The nature of bitcoin makes off chain transaction relatively painless, too. No reason  to send transactions to the blockchain before it makes sense to. 
I just don’t see it falling the way you do. Remember, this is a global asset class and there are a lot of big kids worldwide. 
That said, who knows?

Buying a little bit on a regular interval is the least stressful way to do it (Dollar Cost Averaging or DCA) You’ll catch highs and lows that way. You can try to time the market but its a bit of a gamble. Chances are it’ll go down from wherever you buy. Bitcoin tends to make big moves up when it moves, so its more about being present for those moves than it is about timing, generally.

The hard truth many don't want to admit it's there just aren't as many "leftist" extremists as there are "rightist" extremists. At least not at this point in time. Sure you've got Black Bloc and there are a handful of others, but they simply don't have the same online footprint, same tactical communication strategies, or political strategies of the alt right. They simply do not use propaganda the same way, so the notion of a hard left "Twitter" doesn't begin to make sense.

Ask the people who use bitcoin in Venezuela if it has a valid use case. It is a relatively young protocol still under active development so adoption is still incredibly niche, but it is doing its job, despite the volatility. A fiat currency necessarily must have some semblence of good governance underpinning it since fiat is essentially value by decree. Who it is making the decree is of vital importance. In most western systems this role has been absorbed by central banks who, via appointed experts, make decisions, essentially, about the size and movement of the money supply. The legitimacy of this system is supported, fundamentally, by the rule of law, which, as we’re seeing, is much more vulnerable to bad actors than many of us assumed given a comparatively long stretch of global peace and cooperation.
As this stability is challenged by subversion of the rule of law, by resurgent geopolitical actors with a variety of agendas, the need for a non political, non fiat store of value that is not a national currency or financial instrument dependent on laws issued by fiat within the context of corrupted political systems becomes quite urgent, especially as this is occurring at a pivotal time in human history where climate change has the potential to threaten the very fabric of civilization and the existence of mankind and most life forms on earth. We’re looking at the very likely displacement of entire nations worth of people which will lead directly to armed conflict, dramatic civil unrest, the deterioration of good governance, etc. Weak governments are going to be flipped on their head and strong ones are going to be challenged in ways most of us haven’t seen in our lifetime. 
Bitcoin is such a system. Its a hedge against some degree of geopolitical uncertainty at a time where geopolitical uncertainty is increasing in every corner of the world because it is a distributed ledger that will continue to persist as long as WANs networks exist and digital storage of information is a thing. If either of those go away, we’re all beyond fucked no matter what. 
Its use case, as others have pointed out, is to be ideal money. A non political, algorithmic, distributed, persistent ledger where the rule of law enforced and maintained by math itself. 
If you can’t see the value there, I question if you understand what is valuable.

Meh. Its a stablecoin and we don’t know exactly how they’ll use it. As far as I’m concerned it just looks like tether 2.0. Noone wonders if Facebook has the money, so that’s nice, but its not like we have a shortage of stablecoins available. 
I’m curious to see how they use it, though. They have the most ridiculously large reach of any company in the world, so it could be significant, but IIRC they’ve been trying to make facebook payments a thing for a while now and I don’t know anyone who’s ever bothered with it. If they don’t do something bold, I don’t really see much room for it unless it somehow gets grandma interested in the crypto market. Simply adding another platform payment option isn’t going to make that much of a difference IMO, and given their reckless behavior with customer privacy, I don’t see many people in crypto looking to trust them with keys or anything.
Might just be a way to automate and standardize pseudo anonymous aggregated spending data among the principal partners of paypal and Visa, though. Depends on how much commerce they force through globalcoin. I mean, their business is big data and this could unlock a treasure trove of data via blockchain analysis that could be used to hone in on consumer spending habits in a way they haven’t been able to do before. They’re an ad company, after all. Also explains their partnership with Paypal and Visa. I suspect both companies would have an interest in profiling consumer spending habits. 
Sooo, I probably won’t bother with it, personally, but there’s a possibility none of us will have a choice anyway, if you own a visa card.

Depends on the balance, really. Also circumstances. Are you going to need a good credit score soon? Do you have a plan to handle your cc debt? Are your minimum payments hurting your ability to meet other obligations? Do you have the ability to pay it down without crypto? 
People talk about cc debt like its a monster, and it can be, but being a slave to debt is more about having debt you can’t handle than it is about simply carrying a balance. If its a manageable debt load, I think it’s pretty ridiculous to suggest you should wait until its gone before you play with crypto. I mean, if this goes somewhere it could completely wipe your debt out, you know? I think it’s irresponsible advice to suggest everyone place debt ahead of every other investment. Its all about interest rates, really. If your investment is kicking back orders of magnitude higher return than your debt, what good sense does it make to prioritize debt? That’s just return you’re missing.
Of course, bear in mind there is a significant risk component here that is harder to quantify beyond interest rates. To wit: your debt load isn’t going to disappear, but your investment *could*. So the answer to the question is sorta dependent on your confidence in the investment vehicle. I think any rational mind thinking in generalities will submit that crypto is insanely volatile and banking on it to pay your debt down rather than doing it yourself is balls to the wall risky and probably stupid. They aren’t wrong. In general. *But* that advice will never take into consideration what you know about your circumstances or what you know about the market.
My position is if you have a manageable debt load, buying a position in crypto is probably smart AF. If you have an unmanageable debt load, you’ve got more pressing matters to worry about and you need to focus on making your debt load manageable (gone is not the same as manageable). But, ultimately, debt is just leverage. *If* you can use leverage to your advantage you’re stupid not to, especially for the sake of prioritizing debtors who would *never* prioritize you. But you *have* to manage your risk appropriately. 
Also, another heuristic: would you feel comfortable spending a little cash on yourself with your current debt load? Like, movies, shoes, restaurants, etc. If yes then you can splurge a commensurate amount on crypto. If no, your risk is *way* too high.

Halvings are newsworthy events, so media coverage likely lead to fence sitters jumping in after deciding to finally do their diligence. The combo of the general portfolio reallocation that occurs before and after the halving due to permanently tightening supply, plus new blood in the ecosystem, plus media attention leads the price to a pretty steady climb upward which generates a lot of retail FOMO. People who jump in after the halving talk about how well they’re doing with bitcoin, others start seeing those numbers tick upward, it becomes a topic at Thanksgiving, everyone wants a piece, and like clockwork we’re parabolic again.

Its anyone’s guess, but my opinion is that people underestimate the effect that halvenings have on supply. The supply shock is priced in at the time of the halvening, so the immediate shock doesn’t really move the price at all, but I do think there’s a realization that happens among traders and miners that the block rewards will literally never, ever be higher, and so people tend to recalculate their exposure based on that information. Many traders are doing this ahead of time, but I suspect there are enough who don’t that this generalized portfolio rebalancing tends to temporarily tighten supply, leading to jumps in price which, as we’ve seen, tend to trigger bull runs. The anticipation of a price increase also serves as a kind of self fulfilling prophecy. The protocol primes the pump.
Just a guess. I’m sure someone could look at the order books to draw conclusions based on data, but seems plausible in any case.

TLDR most coins are shitcoins playing follow the leader with bitcoin with a few caveats he points to for the sake of diversification. He also points out a few similarities and differences between the crypto market and the early internet, namely, that zombie coins don’t get delisted when they die like pets.com did, for instance.

The bitcoin network is a large part what gives bitcoin value. There are thousands of dedicated mines that operate as defacto server farms for the bitcoin network. There has been an enormous investment in this infrastructure that people tend to blow on by, and theres also the reality that this is tried and tested infrastructure to boot. Bitcoin’s network effects and first mover advantage make it *extraordinarily* unlikely another crytpo could come along and supplant it as the reserve crypto because in order for that to happen it would have to be *better* than bitcoin at what bitcoin does best, which is to be a censorship resistant, trustless, decentralized, stateless medium of exchange and account, *and* people would need a reason to move away from bitcoin, on top of that. Bitcoin has a decade of trust behind it now. That’s extremely significant and not something you can conjure up. Bitcoin has earned it. 
That said, the most feasible scenario for this sort of circumstance would be a flaw in the protocol, but that would also affect myriad blockchain projects and the unaffected ones likely wouldn’t be reliant on the same ASIC hardware. 
So, you’re *technically* correct, but you also completely gloss by two of the most significant advantages bitcoin has over the notion of “blockchain” or even competing crypto projects. The longer it exists successfully, the more entrenched it will become as the premier asset in its class. All it needs to do to succeed is continue to exist. 
Obviously, none of this precludes the possibility of other successful blockchain projects in the ecosystem, but they will be successful based on  their individual use cases, similar to ethereum, stellar, or bnb. But even in those instances, most of the benefits of another blockchain could be delivered to the bitcoin network via L2, L3 solutions. 
It’s actually pretty helpful to view bitcoin vs other blockchains similar to the early OS development wars in the 90s. Windows won out in part because of its first mover advantage and network effects. Right now, bitcoin has a $200B network effect to overcome in *addition* to its undisputed first mover advantage. 
Remember: every bubble in bitcoin is chased by copycat blockchains and none of them have even come *close* to replacing bitcoin. Some have been successful in their own right, but bitcoin is the undisputed king for a reason. Its worth thinking about why that is.

Is gold more intrinsically valuable than iron? How about copper? Platinum? They're all metals, why is gold such a much better store of value than the others? 
Bitcoin is benefitting from the same sociological phenomenon. The value isn't just in the ones and zeroes that its composed of, the value is in the perception of bitcoin as a store of value. Dogecoin might contain very similar math, similar ones and zeroes, but the perception of dogecoin is, quite accurately, a joke. It was founded as a joke, made people some money so a number of them take it seriously, but Dogecoin was and remains a joke coin. Bitcoin is not a joke.

Of course it'll correct once people cash out their forked coins, but by how much? ETH and Litecoin haven't enjoyed explosive growth, but they've been holding damn steady for months. What makes you think the money flowing into BTC is entirely pumped? Will it flow back into those coins? Will it all be taken out as cash? Or are people realizing that alt coins are still alt coins? No idea. I expect a drop, but I expect it'll be moderate. People gotta realize profits after all. I don't see it falling back to where it was even a few months ago. You can look at the trading volume  for BTG and BCC. I really don't the forked coins thing is going to matter that much. It might even push the price up as people sell the coins for bitcoin and hold the bitcoin.
What we have seen over the past few months is increasing, normalized, pros and cons type coverage from respected sources. Major industry players are putting out papers that reflect positively on it. CME has decided to open a derivatives market for bitcoin, which is something even a number of months ago they didn't think they'd bother with. Economists are studying it, books are being released, etc. There is media attention all over the place. Will the bubble pop? Yeah, at some point. But what will it deflate to? I don't think anyone has a good answer to that. Noone really knows what this thing is worth. Right now, the price is a best guess and yes, its based on a lot of optimism and opportunism, but that doesn't mean the guess is wrong. Hell, there's a good chance despite its meteoric rise that its still grossly undervalued.

Unpopular opinion here but there's nothing wrong with trusting a respectable third party like Coinbase with your Bitcoin. Drawbacks, as others have mentioned, are primarily that your Bitcoin aren't "yours" so if something happens there's a chance you could lose them or they'll settle with you in fiat and that's entirely true, but it's increasingly unlikely and there's absolutely a place in the market for a businesses that absorbs the risks of holding Bitcoin directly. 
People here tend to understate the risks of being primarily responsible for their keys, too. I've read a ton of stories of people getting locked out of their wallets, losing sometimes significant sums due to very easy to make mistakes. I've generated paper wallets, I've got Ledgers, but I still find myself wondering how to secure the keys in a way that isn't a more complicated equivalent of shoving them under a mattress. No matter how you slice it, those keys are much more vulnerable in your hands than in the hands of a large organization responsible for billions of dollars of other people's money. 
Don't get me wrong. There are ways, but as you mentioned, they aren't insured. 
With Bitcoin, I love having the *option* of being my own bank. It's liberating in a very real way. But I also like there option of having a more competent bunch of people than me absorb the risks of holding my wealth, too. Freedom comes with responsibility and *risk*.

Bitcoin isn't AOL. It's TCP/IP. 
Why would anyone move their money out of Bitcoin into an alt that doesn't have close to the network power, hasn't been around for nearly as long, doesn't have the development community behind it, doesn't have the name recognition? When were talking about something intended to be a store of value, all of that matters a great deal more than choosing between Facebook and Myspace or CompuServe and AOL. This is money. 
The only way a serious switch makes any kind of sense is if something catastrophic happened with the Bitcoin protocol and at that point I have a hard time seeing anyone bothering with another crypto. Would be a while before that trust is rebuilt.

So the reason that gold was (is) valuable was because of very specific properties of gold that made it easily extractable and exchangeable? IS that true today? I would posit that it is not. My comment was never about the historical value of gold, but a discussion of its current value and the perception that makes it valuable today compared to other metals.
Gold has historical value, but intrinsic value? Today? Yeah, its a good conductor and its soft and malleable which gives it some very  specific industrial applications and its easy to forge into jewelry, but that's where the intrinsic part ends. Beyond that you're talking about perception. Gold is valuable because its always been valuable. 
BTW, I'm not trying to challenge the value propostition of gold. I think its valid. I'm also suggesting that bitcoin has a valid perception as a store of value, too.
The industrial applications will be sorted out in the future. Remember, bitcoin has only been around for 10 freaking years. But industrial applications (or what most people consider to be intrinsic value) are coming. 
Bitcoin is the real deal.

Right, but remember that this supply shock directly impacts the value of present *and future* bitcoin holdings rather dramatically. After a halvening event, miners are unlikely to immediately release new coins to exchanges at the same rate, which exaggerates the effect of the shock on liquidity. It won’t be just 900 coins worth of liquidity pulled out, it’ll be a much, much more significant amount since there is no possibility of the block reward for mining ever going back up at any point in the future. This has a knock on effect of non miner traders actually pulling coins *out* of circulation into cold storage. People who were comfortable risking a portion of their stack are suddenly much less comfortable risking the same percentage of bitcoin. 
This, I suspect, is part of what triggers the regular parabolic price movement after halvening. Not sure exactly what triggers the run itself. Typically whales, my guess. As we saw recently, a decent size buy can kick off a run pretty easily. As the price climbs, hype builds and people fomo in, leading to mainstream media attention which pulls even *more* people into the space, causing the price to skyrocket. Once this action starts, it doesn’t stop until the hype cycle resolves, which can happen because of technical limitations like last bubble, or Mt Gox the bubble before. 
This, I think, is why there are repeated bubbles after halvening events in bitcoin. Every event pulls in people new to the space, some of whom trade, some of whom end up holding coins indefinitely. The parabolic movement and subsequent burst lead to another round of price discovery, which is why the price seems to advance exponentially. Given how new this entire space is, I see no reason why the trend wouldn’t continue, especially given that institutional investors will have access to custodial services and BAKKT will require physical settlement of coins. Its possible that institutional presence in the market may depress some of the parabolic movement, but I don’t really know. Hard to guess, really. 
I don’t have numbers to back any of this up, btw, just spitballing.

The price is driven by adoption, but the value is in the protocol as an immutable trust less borderless means to store and exchange wealth. It is an asset.  These aren't beanie babies or social networks. Coinbase is AOL. Bitcoin is email itself. But as Manhattan real estate.
Remember, people have been trying to create the next Bitcoin since it's inception and only a handful have managed to create anything of value. The reason for this is that they misunderstand exactly why Bitcoin is so valuable in the first place. Concentrated good money has gravity. Bitcoin is exactly that..The longer is around, the bigger it gets, the more trustworthy it proves itself to be, the more money is attracted to it. It's a cascading positive feedback loop. the more it becomes tested, proven, the more people trust it and the more trusted it becomes there more likely people are to place increasingly significant parts of their wealth in it. 
Of course Bitcoin is worth nothing without people, and trends change, but changing trends tend attract fast money. Bitcoin is definitely still in this phase, but the *real* money is much, much slower and much, much less resistant to changing trends. That's the money Bitcoin is beginning to attract. 
Bitcoin is still best at being Bitcoin and the longer that remains true the less likely it is that another coin usurps is position. Only way that happens is if something better, really, actually better, comes along . It can definitely happen, but it would also require that Bitcoin refuse to adapt to changing conditions in the space. Bitcoin is incentivized to be the best version of what it is by design. 
Also, bear in mind that one of the things that makes a store of value better as a store of value is a legacy of being a store of value. Other successful coins are basically carving out niches based on unique use cases.

I get where you're coming from and I appreciate it, btw, but I wasn't actually commenting on the unique properties of gold. I'm not a geologist, but I'm sure you could enumerate the properties of copper, platinum, etc that could concevievably make it more valuable than another metal. Point I'm making is that the intrinsic properties of a metal for the sake of exchange are less relevant than the general perception that they're valuable (the historical precedent part of your comment).

Hmm. While a technically superior solution could dethrone Bitcoin, it's probably only going to happen if people en masse understand what the differences are, and the only way that happens is if it the cryptosphere becomes big enough to demand crypto literacy. At the point that is necessary, Bitcoin will be unstoppably huge.

God this is such a dumb argument.

Where I agree with you: putting money in bitcoin is speculating. 
Where you guys are pissing into the wind: putting money in bitcoin is not investing. 
It absolutely is investing for many people. Many spent time researching the product (bitcoin), decided the *product* had value based on the service it provides (a digital, trustless, stateless, open source, decentralized ledger that is engineered to be the closest thing to ideal money the world has seen that is currently, actively being *developed as a software protocol* accessible anywhere the internet exists, which is everywhere), and decided to invest in its future by purchasing and holding bitcoin. 
Is it a revenue producing asset? Not in the traditional sense. Its a perfectly supply constrained digital asset (a thing that has literally never existed before ever in history) that kickstarted a $200B dollar market out of fucking nowhere. Its a bit like real estate, a bit like money, a bit like stock, and a whole lot like nothing else before it. 
But I suppose you know better. After all, how could a financial instrument have value if you don’t know how to evaluate it, amirite?

If Bitcoin goes where it might go, you're doing yourself a disservice not getting involved significantly. Furthermore, there are a couple Bitcoin ETFs in the pipeline, so there's food for thought if you're interested in traditional investment vehicles and you don't really want to buy or own significant amounts of crypto directly.
Btw, for those about to get after me for suggesting Bitcoin is actually a relatively safe bet and not a risky speculative asset, save your breath. Bitcoin has been attacked, dismissed, picked apart, politicked, tested, tested, and tested some more and it's still here, growing and gaining traction. It's rules are transparent, it's governance is algorithmic, and it continues to work as intended despite nothing but headwind for as long as it's been around. It's helping people in states with unstable inflationary currency, it's providing an option for the unbanked and under banked, and it's beginning to enable people who otherwise would not have the option to participate in the global market to trade. 
Furthermore, people who have been calling it a risky highly speculative asset never seem to be able to explain how that is beyond pointing at the volatility. Yes, it's a volatile asset. It's perfectly supply constrained which exaggerates price movement.  but the year over year price trends have been reliably positive. With a few exceptions. That's almost a decade of returns.  Until last night, everyone who has ever bought at any price had made money. This is not a new phenomenon in the space. 
At any rate, my suggestion is to test the naysayers. Ask them to explain their reasoning. If they talk about it being overpriced, ask them what an accurate valuation should be. Guarantee they won't have a solid answer because there's a non zero chance they don't know much about Bitcoin and are simply applying their knowledge of legacy financial markets which, well..  that only goes so far with a completely brand new asset class. It's not dismissing them, its critically thinking about their arguments. 
Also, if you've got a high risk tolerance anyway due to circumstance, not putting money in one of the best performing investments literally ever is crazy. Diversification is important obviously, but an aggressive investment strategy that doesn't include a significant Bitcoin position is freaking conservative. 
The way I look at it is my job and my 401k are my by the book investments. I've been on long enough to watch bubbles grow and pop and grow and pop but the one constant is that people who shit on Bitcoin end up with egg on their faces. I can't buy a house with it yet, but another year of this  and I will. Another two years and I'll be able to quit my job, go to school, and afford a family, too. 
Obviously I'm biased, so take everything I'm saying with that in mind, but one of the significant advantages of youth is the ability to take risks you wouldn't be able to later on in life.

I think its important to qualify this statement. "If I only listened to experts, smart people, people with pHds, scientists, politicians, doctors, my grandpa, my dad, talking heads, etc ad naseum, I'd be significantly worse off than I am right now."
Fact is its important, *very* important, to listent to people who understand a thing talk about the thing they understand. Its also important to recognize the limits of that understanding. I looked to the experts *in bitcoin* to understand it, some of them doctors, all of them highly qualified and smart people, and came away better for it. 
Its important to rely on the opinions of educated people. Its also important to understand the limitations of education and not be suckered into arguments for authority. A doctorate doesn't make someone an expert. Expertise makes someone an expert.

You say at some point there will be global impact and opposing political forces at higher levels, yet the post instigating this convo was you suggesting people sell? I apprecaite your explanation you but have done nothing at all to convince me that you are posting without ulterior motives.
THAT SAID, I don't particularly care, believe it or not. I'm of the opinion that if bitcoin is going to be worth anything meaningful it needs to be tested against the best (and worst) that the market has to offer because if it doesn't succeed against market forces, it is doomed to failure. As I mentioned earlier, so far so good.
That, btw, is the reason I'm bullish on bitcoin. As long as it continues to exist, it will eventually thrive because its value proposition is based, primaily, in addition to its networked, decentralized payment system, on its continued existence and its ability to adapt to existential threats (anti fragile etc). A store of value immune to poltical back and forth is very, *very* valuable. If it gets to where its tested in that realm, most of the people buying in today are going to be really fuckin happy.
Anyhow, I don't doubt you have experience in futures trading against professionals, but you have to acknolwedge that this forum is for *everyone*. Posts like the one I responded to are going to influence emotionally immature, over invested folks in a negative way and, frankly, I think that's unethical. This isn't wall street. Like you mentioned, there is an information imblance, and I'm unwillilng to add to it for my own benefit.
FYI, I'm a police dispatcher with no trading experience whatsoever. Take that for what its worth.

Only way Bitcoin will gain mass adoption is if it's easy for the masses to buy and use it. Bitcoin provides people with the option to be their own bank, but for plenty of people that's a terrifically bad idea. Banks are *going* to be major players in crypto like it or not, and that owner a bad thing.

I definitely concede that jewlry is part of the demand for gold, but my *guess* is that its valuable primarily because of its historical value and its social context. Otherwise platinum would be obviously more precious. 
I agree with your assessment that the value of bitcoin right now is being driven primarily by speculation. Its also being driven by international demand. The unspoken assessment, at least beased on your comment, is that you think that bitcoin is valueless. I disagree emphatically. It is a borderless currency available anywhere the internet is available which is pretty much anywhere. This can't be said of any other currency. That is a profoundly valuable quality.

No, not really. People were very aware of Mt Gox solvency issues, there were tons of rumors floating around, suspicious activity on exchanges, runaway pricing compared to other sites, inability to withdraw money or coins, etc. Noone in the space was surprised when they imploded. 
Coinbase just stopped trading for a bit while they came to grips with the insane volume. 
Also, for perspective, there's no way on Gods green earth they'd be successfully starting an institutional custodial service for crypto of they were facing solvency issues. They'd be laughed out of the conference room and all the way back home on Twitter.

I agree with everything you said. OF particular emphasis to me is that gold was chosen b"because it's intrinsically the best choice to store and transfer value". At this point, to me its fairly obvious that the best means to store AND transfer value is no longer gold. Bitcoin is light years ahead of gold in terms of its ability to transfer value and store it. You don't need physical space to store bitcoin, and there will only be 21 million of them. Easy gold has been mined, but gold is still being mined regardless because its worth it.
Bitcoin is immutable in a way that gold is not. 
I honestly can't see an argument for gold that holds water against bitcoin. I mean, yeah there's apocalypse, but at that point everything is starting over anyway.

Properly and safely securing a digital asset worth institutional sums is a different ballpark from stuffing a list of seed words under your mattress or locking it in a file cabinet somewhere. Plus, a custodial service can enable the client be insured against loss while the service provider gets to take a nibble out of their humongous holdings. 
It is, essentially, hiring security experts to do the security work so you don't have to. 
Bitcoin gives you the option to be your own bank and that's incredibly liberating and cool, but just because you can be doesn't mean banks and services like them are useless. 
*EDIT* When we're talking about crypto in general, people often toss around the term "use case". 
The "Use case" of a bank is to secure your wealth. Next time anyone asks you about "what is bitcoin worth?" as them what they're bank is worth. Than advise them that bitcoin serves a similar function but without a premium attached to hiring people and providing for their employ.

Think of it less like a stock split and more like someone photocopying a bond changing the borders and declaring it a better bond. Doesn't change the original bonds you hold, there's a good chance the copied bonds will be worth nothing, but some people think they might *actually* be better bonds because of the new filigree so they still retain some value for the time being. 
It's happened a bunch of times and none of the other bonds have come close to toppling Bitcoin. Also, the photocopied bonds are always based off of Bitcoin, not another photocopied bond. 
It's a crazy amount of hubris, tbh. Been happening for years, too. In 2013 it was small enough that people just started a bunch of new Bitcoin based shit coins thinking they could market it into prominence. This, of course, is ridiculous and didn't work because a coin, to succeed, needs to be actively developed. 
That, btw, is why I think 2x will fall flat. There is one developer for that coin. One. And he's actively working on another shit coin project. How 2X is even perceived as a credible project is beyond me.

Bring them on. Futures bring legitimacy to the space which is what will enable real money to flow into Bitcoin. once big money has a stake, you can expect regulatory uncertainty to subside a bit since it's practically inevitable that wall street lobbyists will throws some pro crypto legislation at congress. Especially true if they start making big money with Bitcoin. 
Furthermore that legitimacy will encourage funds to offer exposure to their clients, will increase the probability that an ETF will be approved, and will essentially plug Bitcoin into the world of real wealth. 
Remember: the entire crypto space is about a quarter the size of Apple.

I actually think the politics are less important than the tech, tbh. That's the test, really, and the interesting thing about bitcoin to me. The entire protocol was designed to be politically resistant. 
And I agree completly with your position on TA. Unfortunately, lots of people come in here with this shit skyrocketing, thinking they're genius for getting in ahead of their peers but without understanding that they don't know what they don't know. Of course, this is true for literally everyone everywhere, but bitcoins interdisciplinary nature has a tendency to really expose that fact for people who aren't used to it.
I agree, btw, that a decline is inevitable. May not be today, tomorrow, or even the next year (unlikely, I know, but possible), tbh, but its inevitable. The real question is what happens next. What happens after the weak hands get shaken out this time?
Noone actually knows, but this, believe it or not, looks like a much more tempered rise than 2013. Past performance isn't an indicator of future performance because people look for patterns where there aren't patterns, but you're also an idiot if you ignore what appear to be somewhat established patterns because of that maxim.

Its just a password manager. 1password and lastpass are the two best commercial options, IMO.  Keepass is another open source one that works great, but it isn't a streamlined service like the other two. User experience isn't top notch. Benefit being its open source and everything about it is transparent, no trusted third party, etc. 
In any case, if you aren't using one of those three services and you own bitcoin, you've basically got a target painted on your forehead.
Plus, they're actually nice to have. They remember logins and accounts for all the sites you visit so you don't have to. And they give you a layer of plausible deniabilty. "No, I honestly can't give you the password to my facebook because I don't know what it is. Why the fuck are you asking for my password?".

I'm holding because I think it's going to work. I've been aware of it since it was sold for pizza, invested since before Gox, and I've been fascinated by its potential ever since I did the deep dive before putting money in it.

Only if you ignore everything else that's been happening in bitcoin.

Don’t get too hung up on the price movement. Dat trading crypto is a good way to lose your shirt. If you must look at charts, just watch log scales over long timelines. 
My recommendation re bitcoin is as follows: 
1.	Understand exactly what it is you’re purchasing when you “buy bitcoin”. The simple paradigm that works best for me is that of real estate. With bitcoin, there will only ever be 21M parcels of property, 21M btc, on the bitcoin blockchain ledger, and “keys” are what give you exclusive access to that property. What you are keeping safe are those keys, the string of letters and numbers, that allow you to parcel out and trade that property. Wallets are the typically encrypted files that store those private keys. But bear in mind, if you lose your wallets or keys, that property is forever inaccessible. Noone can change the locks. Also, understand that this analogy is very limited. There is a *ton* to learn about bitcoin, blockchains, and cryptographically secured distributed ledgers. Honestly, you should read the bitcoin white paper. Its quite accessible. 
2.	Learn everything you can about digital security best practices, especially if you have the intention of managing your own keys. Understand that digital security is risk management and what amounts to acceptable risk varies from person to person. You will often hear people say “not your keys, not your bitcoin “ in reference to people who leave their money on established exchanges, but there is a level of risk you assume by directly managing your own keys that often gets whitewashed here. In some instances, it might be safer to leave it on an exchange. For others, cold storage is a better option, for others still a custodial service makes the most sense.. Much of that determination depends on how you want to use bitcoin. 
3.	 Never invest more than you can afford to lose and avoid the temptation to gamble with day trading. There are some very hungry sharks that day trade crypto and you’re very likely to get burned. I would recommend picking a length of time you intend to hold onto it for and sticking to it. 5 years, 10 years, etc, regardless of what the market does. Crypto is volatile AF.

You obviously have no conception of just how much money there is sloshing around the global financial system. Seriously. Do some basic research on the money supply. A cursory googling of the size of the derivatives market will tell you that its 1.4 *quadrillion* dollars.

I'm not afraid of any news source at all. I've had that rainbow firehosed down my throat since I was a kid and, crucially, I'm fully aware of that. Like I mentioned, a diversity of sources is incredibly important to forming a clear picture of what's happening. I pay attention to all the sources you listed plus tons of others, too, and I'm well aware of the dangers of living in a media echo chamber no matter your ideology. 
But I also prefer my sources fact dense, opinion light or opinion free if at all possible, and I try not to watch anything for news at all if I can avoid it since the talking head format is pretty awful for communicating nuanced concepts. 
 I avoid RT for the same reason I avoid Breitbart, InfoWars, dailyKos, and Shareblue: the substance matters less than the angle and you can get the substance *and* the angle from better sources. Those sources have so much noise its unreal. Incidentally, the noise is also the reason I use ublock origin. Propaganda is fucking exhausting. By design. 
But this link isn't news, it's commentary (as comedy). I don't care for commentary in general, but especially when it comes from sources like RT Fox and the like who have a "complex" relationship to the truth (ie they lie. A lot.)

That there will be a mix of proprietary and open source systems in the Bitcoin ecosystem is inevitable and welcome. The heavy lift of a trust less blockchain and lightning is done. It's unrealistic and naive to think closed source software isn't going to be a significant part of crypto going forward. As long as the important bits are decentralized and open source, which they are, it'll be fine. Who knows, maybe PayPal's system will be the defacto lightning network for Luddites and fogies, you know? You can't be compelled to use their service and a brain dead simple way for people to transact using a familiar platform will only spur adoption and that's an unequivocally good thing.

I'm not robbing my neighbor by voting for "taxes", I'm simply voting to ensure my neighbor does not rob me by refusing to pay his due.

I think the voting public doesn't understand what's actually going on by design. Beauracracy can definitly obsufscate crony deals, but it also complicates other kinds crony deals so its more of a red herring than anything. 
The problem with cronyism is largely an issue of ineffective oversight. Far more oso the  issue of bloated organization. Furthermore, effective oversight *requires* well funded, independent beuracracy. How can it properly investigate who needs investigating if investigations are the whim of a single executive?

Broken systems need reform. They sometimes need complete deconstruction. But the taxation is theft meme is brain-dead stupid and it does nothing but further entrench the grip of those same corrupt industrialists by weakening the only structures available to the rest of us that are capable of keeping their power in check.
Representative governments aren't very representative in the US, but they still act as a hedge against the worst abuses of monied interests which is why those interests are so desperate to rip them down. They need to be fortified and forced to respond to the will of the people so they become more representative. That means taxes remain a part of the equation for the foreseeable future until there's a better alternative to governance. 
Furthermore, unless the entire monetary system comes crashing down worldwide and those guns and bombs already built by that military industrial complex also disappear, we have to reckon with the fact that geopolitics continue to exist and power structures aren't just ideas. Governments do not have a monopoly on coercive force. They simply have a monopoly on its legal application by consent, either tacit or explicit, of the people who live under them. Tear them down and you've got power vacuums that *will* be filled, and what they gets filled with is almost entirely dependent on whoever is strongest, most organized, and most opportunitistic at the time things comes crashing down. 
The groups most likely to fill those voids would military, police, or criminal organizations. Instead of theft by taxation on a mass scale, you most likely become subject to theft by actual physical violence instead, and without the benefit of the rule of law and no recourse for redress of your grievances. Plus, there is a need to reestablish legitimacy in the eyes of the people. That's really fucking hard to do and the only way it ever gets done is by war, which means a lot of people die. Also, you'll probably still get taxed, but that tax will be demanded by whoever has enough the firepower to make it happen. And those numbers won't be the same and they probably won't be good for you. 
Scenarios like those have borne out time and time and time again all over the world. Revolution is a fucking crapshoot. Even peaceful revolutions are a crapshoot if the people perpetuating them don't start with a clear, functional idea of how to address real problems created by power vacuums without resorting to ideological magical thinking. 
I'm a pragmatic person by nature. I'm in Bitcoin because I want something better than we have, same as you. I see it as a *possible* foundation for a better world, but it's not a cure all and there are no guarantees. In the meantime, it's incredibly stupid and dangerous to kick the legs out from under institutions that keep us from the nightmare of living in a world dominated by individuals and interests with unchecked power who are in no way accountable to you. 
Your options are: 1. participate in the (a) social contract 2. Do not participate and accept the consequences of living a nasty, brutish world. 
If you want to try out option 2, there's always a life of crime. Good luck.

I agree that there is not such thing as an independent bureaucracy, but bureaucracy adds institutional inertia which makes it resistant to change which means its resistant to rapid changes in power structures. That, essentially, is the US great strength: layers upon layers upon layers of beauracracy.

First of all, chill the fuck out. I'm a bitcoiner all the way. 


Appeal to authority out of the gate? Yeesh. That's like blowing your load before foreplay. Also, that usually happens when you're looking to assert credibility ahead of a series of weak arguments, just an fyi. Let your arguments stand on their own merits. Authority will carry more weight if you bring it in when its pertinent. Right now? Not fucking pertinent.


You mean Mugabe? Yes, he's a strong man that has absolute of control of the territory of Zimbabwe which he's retained by force. But geopolitical power? Zimbabwe is less than a minnow. It might as well not exist for all the "power" and influence it has on global markets.


This shows your lack of reading comphrension, not my lack of understanding. Reread my comment. Hell, look at my history before you jump down my throat. I know what bitcoin is and I never, ever, asserted that bitcoin is backed by nothing. 


I know. But artificial value is still value and as long as the US state has influence on global markets, its artificial value which, for all intent and purposes, is indistinguishable from real value on a day to day basis, will continue to exist.

In other words, in worth what price I'm able to negotiate for my services, correct?
So if I want more money I need to strengthen my negotiating position. As it happens, business owners have been lobbying for laws that strengthen their negotiating position and weaken mine since I'm still working for a wage and they've been doing it for 40+ years. End result is in making less than I would be if the deck hadn't been stacked against me my by corrupt businessmen, their lobbyists, and the politicians who took their money.

No, you're not getting it: it doesn't matter what dumb people think of Bitcoin. Dumb people don't think, that's what makes them dumb. They follow the crowd and the opinions of people they trust. People who think aren't going to write off a piece of fine art because of antifa propaganda and they aren't going to write off Bitcoin because of a T-shirt. The masses will come around, but no one here has an obligation to make this a more comfortable or inviting space to by caterung to the ever changing whims and opinions of idiots.

In fairness, gold isn't really used as much as a currency, either, and the internet initially was intended as a space for academics to send info to each other. Furthermore, expecting bitcoin it to replace national fiat is very much cart ahead of the horse at this point. In its current state bitcoin is more likely to become an open source global settlement layer than a day to day currency. But even so, it still maintains the properties and functionality of a currency. 
Case in point, if you could send 2 tons of physical gold to someone else via email, carry it on your phone, and each of those tons were divisible right from your device down to 100,000,000 individual units, wouldn't that have value as a currency to some? In principle its obvious. In practice its a matter of adoption. It's prospects for adoption are precisely what makes it so volatile and risky at this point, but it's also true that it is currently functioning as a currency right now. If someone offered to pay me for something in bitcoin I'd jump at it. It's actually my preference, and there are millions like me all over the world. Just so happens we're still a drop in the bucket.

I agree with your last sentence, but there *is* a strong case for holding when you're told your house is burning down when, in fact, it is not. 
35% swings are pretty damn common in bitcoin because its still an insanely new space. Its the wild wild west, governments still don't quite know what to do with it, so of course uncertainty like the China news is going to send markets absolutely reeling.
The "hodl" meme isn't directed at veteran traders, its directed at people who aren't traders who bought into bitcoin because it makes all sorts of sense.

I think currency is a misnomer anyway. It can be exchanged peer to peer *like* a currency, but it's a digitally native asset. It's a cryptographically secured, decentralized ledger and opening a cc like Bitcoin simply gives you the authority to make changes to the blockchain to the tune of however much of the token you own. 
So, with that in mind, its a bit like real estate, a bit like currency, a bit like email, and a bit like a commodity. 
TBH, I don't think you're ever going to see things priced in crypto. It could happen, but I expect eventually it'll just be background settlement infrastructure and at that purpose it excels because audits are trivially easy on blockchains. It's money as a network. 
Btw, the above reason is also why whichever crypto wins out will be open source, decentralized, not under the control or development of a nation out a bank or a combination of those things. Bitcoin, for better or worse, is the crypto gold standard of security, decentralization, and immutability.

And you're rightly being called out for ignorance about a very famous piece of art. You're being educated, and in response, rather than a "really? It's about peace and throwing flowers and Bitcoin instead of Molotov cocktails? That's a good message. Especially for the antifa jerks I clearly despise. " You're "calling it like you see it" which, btw, only works for referees who know the rules of the game inside and out, ie, are not coming from a place of ignorance. A ref calling it the way you're seeing it would be booed out of the stadium by fans, because you're getting it flat wrong. 
Think of the internet as a sort of VAR for rushed judgements. 
You're opposed because the imagery might echo the antifa propaganda Boogeyman just a bit, despite that it doesn't at all, and it's sending a message that's the polar opposite to whatever principles you believe they espouse (I'm assuming pro violence in some nebulous, mindless form. ). 
And, btw, there's nothing at all wrong with not knowing who Banksy is or even believing in the eveel antifa strawman. There *is* something wrong with being unable to appreciate the message that's actually being communicated, especially when it ostensibly supports your position which, I'm assuming, is peaceful.

Yeah, of course we'd all be better off of we invested the way you're talking about. I can tell you right now, though, that I didn't have an income where it was possible to put money like that away when I was 18. I didn't actually start to have that kind of money until much later in life and it wasn't consistent even then due to shit like student loans, periods of unemployment, dental work, health emergencies, car emergencies, marriage, honeymoon, etc.
With all due respect, there's just a lot of shit life is going to throw at you once you're on your own with no parents house to crash at and lots of real bills to take care of that makes it so you can't always contribute to your retirement the way they teach you to.  If you don't have a job making good money, you're going to have a tough time socking that kind of money away regularly. Have a shitty retail or minimum wage job? Good fucking luck.

But, honestly, If someone is going to run screaming for the hills and shitting all over Bitcoin because they saw a T-shirt they didn't like on Reddit, I would welcome them to stay far the fuck away from this community because that kind of reaction is about as far from reasonable as you can get and I'm guessing they probably won't be level headed about other things, too.

How effective an advertiser do you think you are wearing a Bitcoin t shirt and yelling at people on the internet about Banksys art?
Fact is Bitcoin doing fine. It isn't growing because of any damned T-shirta, Banksy or non Banksy. It's growing because it's good money and interesting tech. The internet didn't blow up because of t shirts, it blew up once it's utility became obvious. It also blew up because AOL sent out CDs to everyone's home for fucking years with the software they needed to get on line. They had kiosks all over the place with"the internet" on it in brick and mortar stores and people thought it was cool. THAT was advertisement. They put the product in people's faces and let them play with it.

Can't speak for other millennials, but the draw for me is for the following reasons: 
1. I get paid garbage mostly because big businesses who live and die by the stock market use their gains to lobby government so they don't have to pay me or any of us what we're worth. Buying stocks feels a bit like supporting that business model. Not interested. 
2. Watching how poorly "serious" hedge fund managers and other people who want to take a slice of my money do relative to index funds while turning their nose up at the rest of us is annoying and off-putting. The biggest bubble in history are their egos. 
3. 2008. Fannie and Freddie. Libor. Enron. Savings and Loan. Wells Fargo. Bailouts. HSBC. The list goes on and on and on. The history of Wall Street is fraud, theft, contempt for the "little guy". I'm not really interested in giving them my money to play with. 
4. I was a kid in the 90s and I watched the internet rise from a collection of obsecure dial up only message boards into what it is today. I remember being talked down to in  the 90s when I mentioned how cool I thought it was, hearing nothing but dismissive doom and gloom regarding the future of the internet. It was a fad, a flash in the pan, solved no problem that wasn't already solved by legacy systems, etc etc. Basically dinosaurs raining on my parade all along the way. 20+ years later,  that curious 10 year old kid has been vindicated. I thought I was watching a transformational tech emerge and I was right. Bitcoin is the internet of money. It's the first tech I've seen that is as transformative. The dinosaurs are still nay saying. I've learned to ignore them. 
6. The returns on the stock market are bullshit when you don't have a lot of money, and millennials in general don't have a lot of money. This means our risk tolerance is a LOT higher than the old guard. The corollary of that is parking what little money we have in an account that's kicking back a couple of percent means we'll be screwed come retirement if we do things by the book. For those of us at the older end of the generation, this is an especially salient point. 
So, for me, it's a combo of high risk tolerance, profound distrust in legacy financial systems and the parties the players in those systems support, a chance to have a retirement, the excitement of an impending technological sea change similar to the one I grew up with in the internet, and a realistic assessment of just how much money the old guard is willing to part with to make our lives better, while also ensuring that my money is going to me, not to some wallstreet chucklefuck who sees me and my thin account as pocket change to pad his bonus. 
Everything about Bitcoin and crypto is more appealing to me than stocks.

The vast majority of them. Also, there are significant differences among states in how they use their state sponsored channels. Rt isn't just a broadcast channel, it's a straight up propaganda outfit like Fox who, btw, is not state sponsored. 
Now I know you're going to try to muddy the waters about how everything is propaganda and nothing can be trusted so might as well expose yourself to everything and sort it out for yourself with critical thinking. This is true to an extent.  It's also true that a diversity of sources is important for a healthy media diet. Noone is suggesting otherwise. 
Any. healthy diet is best with a diversity of sources. 
But it's worth pointing out that if your food sources are McDonalds and Burger King primarily, chances are you're going to be very unhealthy. You need whole foods and those joints don't sell them. It's junk food. Tons of sugar, salt, fat, oversized portions, no fiber if they can avoid it, etc. 
RT is just not a part of a healthy media diet. Yes, you can find a salad there, so to speak, but just like fast food, it's specifically prepared in a way to keep you coming back and your health is just not as important to them than their bottom line.

I don't think its good stratagem to compare the dollar values of "destruction caused by government" vs "destruction cause by private enterprise". At best its hard to determine which has been the most destructive force, and at worst there's the atomic bomb which has been used twice in history compared to how many environmental disasters involving non state entities?

I'm not a bitcoin maximalist. I've owned bitcoin since 2012 and will continue to do so as long as it exists. But I'm also not a head in the sand libertarian and as long as nations exist, they will want to exert control over their national, probably fiat, currency and money supply. 
Money is an important geopolitcal tool and, as such, it will retain value as long as nation states retain their influence and power. The specious reasoning we so often hear about why bitcoin won't be worth anything (its not backed by anything!) is a corollary of an important truth: the dollar *is* backed by something. US fiat is backed by the strength of the state. 
What a crypto-dollar would represent is a total legitamization of crypto currencies, of which bitcoin would remain the first and likely most valuable. I'd put the possibility of it happening pretty low in the mid term tbh. Really depends on how quickly the crypto market grows into a pervasive economic force like the internet. It could happen, but we aren't anywhere near there yet, tbh. If it does, though, bitcoin is going to be absolutely massive.
But, to your point, people would want to mine worthless dollars because they wouldn't be worthless as long as they're considered legal tender for the settlement of all debts within the borders of the USA.

If it's a bubble, what in your opinion, should it be worth? 
Bitcoin is the premier asset in a brand new asset class that governments world wide are still scratching their heads over. Accurate pricing at this stage is almost impossible because it doesn't fit neatly into most regulatory frameworks. Of course much of the price is based on speculation at this point. Noone knows what the crypto sphere is going to look like in a few years. Hell, it hasn't even been around for a decade. Most people don't know what it is. Bitcoin might as well be Mario coins or fairy dust as far as most financial professionals know, let alone the general population. 
But it's utility is obvious. A trustless, pseudonymous, borderless global bank vault that can be shrunk down to 24 or 25 words and traded away like cash has absolutely immense value. The fact that this vault is secured by the world's largest, most powerful, and likely most expensive supercomputing network, must also be taken into consideration when talking about the price and I hardly ever see anyone try to calculate exactly how much access to that kind of network securing an asset with those properties would cost.  Imo, the price reflects both speculation *and* a recognition of just what it is people are holding. 
Furthermore, the price is absolutely being propelled by adoption. Just look at the numbers of new accounts coinbase alone opened up on the past month. Then remember that this kind of adoption is happening globally and in some places at an even higher clip. 
And, fyi, holding it for speculation or even saving *is* adoption for a currency as much spending it for your morning coffee is adoption.

I don't want to burst your bubble, but the free market utopia you're describing could not exist without regulation.
Its like everyone collectively forgot all about Ma Bell. 
Here's the crux: unregulated markets are not free markets, they're just markets free from regulation. 
Without regulation free markets become monopolies because of the dynamic you described. Competitive markets, which I suspect most people think of when using the term "free market", require a government with regulations encouraging competition, not profit alone. Its essential to keep in mind that nothing will ever be more profitable than monopoly.

As always it depends on context. There are a million contexts where it's appropriate to say "I'm gay" or "I'm not gay". There are also a million contexts where either statement is inappropriate.
For instance: If you're being hit on by a gay person and you're not gay, saying "I'm not gay" is actually really appropriate and appreciated by all parties involved in the interaction.
But here? It's irrelevant. It's completely irrelevant, actually, and the fact that you felt you had to say something out of fear of being possibly misidentified as gay shows you might suffer from a bit of lingering homophobia. Not an assumption, but an explanation of how people who aren't you might read your statement.
Fact is noone cares if you're gay or not. People who do care are assholes or ignorant. Not that there's anything wrong with that ;). 
JK there's a huge amount wrong with being an asshole and a huge amount wrong with being ignorant, too. Don't be an asshole, don't be ignorant.

People around here seem to forget that core is going to keep developing no matter what. Coinbase and the rest can call it whatever they want but at the end of the day it's an international currency. Thank God for that. 
Any attempt to swap the asset which most of us purchased which is the asset developed by the core developers at Bitcoin.org for a forked asset would be fraud and you can bet these guys will get sued into the dirt at some point if they keep fucking around like this. It's amazing to me that the community has made it this far without serious litigation against obviously bad actors. It's ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:38:50
I agree completely. This more than anything is the reason I think the fork is insane. Political entities want this. Engineers resoundingly do not. I can't think of a worse precedent than allowing political entities to have a say in modifying the technical parameters of an open source software project built to secure billions of dollars in wealth. 
It's like a mayor telling a bridge designer to just double capacity, NBD, and when advised that is not a good idea, the mayor decides to call his nephew who went to school for engineering and give him the project, not giving a shit that he's off tinkering in his garage with model train bridges.

Bitcoin is a bank account/share of an open source decentralized software bank that you can trade like currency. Expecting it to act like fiat is to not understand what it is. Some people use it as an investment. Some people use it as a savings account. Some people use it as a currency. Not a lot of people user it for any of those uses because not a lot of people have it right now. That's changing, and once it becomes ubiquitous, it'll be less volatile and more likely you'll see things priced in Bitcoin.
It isn't built to replace fiat, it's built to be better money than fiat and to automate needlessly slow settlement processes. This is there world wide web of wire transfers. It's doing for the transfer of value what the internet did for the transfer of information. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:38:37
Of course. Noone is claiming the dollar will suddenly not be fiat if it were converted to a crypto, but if people could earn dollars, actual dollars, running mining farms to secure transactions on the dollar blockchain, you can bet your ass people would sign up to do that. Its a certainty that the dollar wouldn't be deflationary because the fed isn't at all interested in deflationary currency, and its a certainty that the fed would retain centralized control of the monetary policy, but all of that is possible within a blockchain.

Probably more true a few years ago than today, but even so  you can kinda guage the government attitude toward bitcoin by watching the banks. The reaction of banks has largely pretty positive with a number of exceptions.

Sorry if I wasn't clear. My answer implies that, yes, there's always a possibility of things going tits up in the most absurd ways ever. Trump is president, after all, but are those kind of things likely? Of course not. MAD is a thing. Math is a thing. Aliens are not as far as we know right now. Chances are about nil that we're going to get hit by a massive asteroid anytime soon.
 The most likely of the absurdities I listed, imo, would be broadscale coordinated international regulatory crackdown in the short run, and a climate change disaster because science is real and that's where we're headed, 
 but I think we're already at the point where too many people are making too much money and the FOMO is too fuckin real that it won't die by regulation, and the climate shit, well... we're all in this together.

Any system that politicizes academics is setting itself up for failure. If your system of government is so bent on "accountability" that it crucifies scientists for the process of science in the event their hypotheses don't work out is asking for every imaginable problem.

The issue, in my mind, is that people are more convinced of the infallibility of their ideologies than they are of objective evidence. We fix that issue, we fix a lot of our political problems.

Only if people buy it. Holders aren't going to suddenly jump ship because some assholes want to take control of an open source project and privatize it. 
I don't care how much miners slow the network down (which, btw, is literally all they will do until they start losing meaningful amounts of money) I'm interested in holding the open source digital asset being developed by the Core developers who have been at it for a decade. I don't want some new York agreement coin who's only developer is off trying to start his own thing anyhow. 
If they don't want to mine it, so what? It'll be tough for a little bit then the difficulty will adjust back down. Won't affect me at all.

I repeat, unless you like losing your ass, do not day trade and stay far, *far* away from margin trading. Remember this is a comparatively unregulated space so you aren’t just contending against  incumbent players with expertise and fat wallets, you’re also contending against serious bad actors.

I think it’s largely because assholes are often gleefully dismissive of crypto and will often go out of their way to mock, deride, and castigate crypto advocates, so crypto advocates often feel like thet aren’t being given a fair shake and feel like they need to be a bit defensive of their interests.
Case in point, where’s the fusion equivalent of the buttcoin sub? Who out there doesn’t see the value in self driving cars? Who questions the fundamental science behind fusion? Denizens of economics and investing subs alike trash crypto regularly, despite it being the best performing asset class over the past decade and a fascinating, first of its kind example of hard coded programmable monetary policy and a functional solution to the Two Generals problem. 
But even your criticism, I think, is off the mark. People here are routinely critical of crypto. In some ways more than people outside the community. Honestly, though, you’re probably going to find whatever it is you’re looking for. If you’re looking for nuance, you’ll spot it.

1.	Its an uncorrelated asset class. This reason alone is worth tossing a percentage or two at it. 
2.	The bull run up to 20k was in part short circuited because the tech wasn’t mature enough to handle the demand. Since then tremendous capacity has been added to the network via L2 solutons, lightning in particular, and there are myriad improvements being developed and tested as we speak. Development of the protocol has only intensified which, if you understand bitcoin as open source software, which it is, and not just a digital asset/currency/network, this is an incredibly bullish indicator. The world of open source is littered with abandoned projects. The fact that incredibly bright engineers find the problems presented by bitcoin interesting enough to donate their time for free toward its development demonstrates substance. For instance, during most of the 90s and early 00s, linux was widely regarded as a second rate product that couldn’t meaningfully compete with windows or mac on the open market. These days, linux runs the vast majority of servers because the engineers engineered it to be fundamentally stable, not to be profitable. With bitcoin, the focus of development is on security of the blockchain. Consider: bitcoin has grown up in an environment positively rife with fraud, manipulation, theft, massive infosec risk and not one single time in its history has the blockchain bern hacked it the network taken offline. Its been around for 10 years. “Antifragile” is the watchword. The network becomes hardened as it is tested.
3.	Its a censorship resistant open source algorithmic monetary system with global reach. Think about that. Seriously. Anyone who says “bitcoin doesn’t have value” hasn’t thought through the implications of that statement. 
4.	Its an immutable, global digital asset that can be exchanged like currency and natively stored and secured as data. 
5.	The upside is staggeringly massive and the risk, while not insignificant, is overblown. I have yet to read a persuasive argument for how demand for this asset disappears short of the end of the internet which will take down the entire global economy.

Probably a bit of “boy who cried wolf” going on. If every other article is about how bitcoin got hacked again by Socialist North Korean ISIS agents from Russia, people start to tune out, especially when they see relatively benign price movement and growing institutional interest. Basically, the reporting about bitcoin is typically hysterical at best, and people start to justifiably see most of it as noise. 
This, unfortunately, is true within the space, too. Bitcoin reporting in general is garbage.
There’s some danger in this since its not good thing for people to become desensitized to security risks, but overall I think its a net benefit that people aren’t being quite so reactive to what amounts to obnoxious propaganda tactics.

Every now and then I wonder if he’s actually affiliated with some intel agency somewhere who created bitcoin in an attempt to challenge the dollars status as the worldwide reserve currency. Lord knows there are plenty geopolitical interests who would like to see that happen and if it ever gets big enough to sniff that possibility, even coins moving from the genesis blocks wouldn’t immediately threaten its value. Whoever has control of those keys would have unprecedented influence in financial markets. (this is also why I don’t think it’ll ever become the global reserve currency. Those blocks represent massive, persistent uncertainty.) 
At the end of the day, most probable, most reasonable explanation is Hal Finney, but I wouldn’t be *completely* shocked if it was something spookier. Still would be shocked, though. Just an old shower thought.

The only way a coin could replace bitcoin is if it was manifestly superior at doing exactly what bitcoin is best at, which is, fundamentally, being a secure digital commodity. So far, no coin has been able to fundamentally improve on bitcoins primary function. The network effects grow stronger with time, too, so being comparable but a little different just isn't enough. We've been through this before. In  2013 tons of copycat coins popped up or if nowhere, helping to drive the price to 1200 which was the stratosphere at the time. Once it all died down, the majority of the copycat coins disappeared because none of them improved meaningfully on bitcoin in a way powerful enough to overcome the network effect, which was much weaker at the time. 
After this ICO bubble, we're seeing the same thing. The dime a dozen icos tailor built to attract speculators are dying just as predictably as the copycat coins and bitcoin chugs along just fine. Development continues unabated. Infrastructure is improving. The asset is being tested and proving resilient. The ability to survive a speculative mania is pretty remarkable, actually, and the  fact that it's done it a number of times is not insignificant. It's got staying power. 20k saw bitcoin running headlong into its technical limitations. The fees were way, way too high and they undercut the value proposition of the coin. Lightning network is resolving/has resolved those issues, which means the next phase, the layer 3 phase, the phase where people figure out exactly what kind of cool shit you can do with frictonless transfer of value via apps built on top of lightning, is where things will get exciting. Next ceiling will be higher. Only need one killer app to spur widespread adoption which is the primary thing holding back the value of crypto.

I wouldn’t be too worried. This is all pregame to the halvening and most importantly it demonstrates to the casuals and persuadable skeptics that bitcoin is, in fact, not dead. 
100+% price movement is the sort of thing that turns heads, especially since most investors completely wrote it off not that long ago. 
Plus the realities of significant improvements to the network, the pending release of Bakkt, the fact that custodial solutions for institutional investors now exist (they weren’t even around during the 2017 bull run. The entire run was basically retail and bleeding edge adventurous small ball market exposure), means people are going to be *seriously* caught off guard by how quickly this thing is going to fly. The fact it moved up while the broader markets tanked due to Trumps idiotic trade war is another profoundly bullish indicator. 
This asset is being geared up for an insane, absolutely epic move. One things for sure: the move won’t happen until it absolutely needs to.

Enh. Coinbase is a private company and they can do business with whoever they want. Milo pissed off a loooot of people and it’s reasonable that a business might not want to alienate potential consumers to take a controversial political stance. Toxic brands are toxic. 
In any case, Coinbase is a bank, they aren’t bitcoin. Milo can still use the network if he wants. This is just the free market being the free market. Moaning about this is completely missing the damn point of bitcoin to begin with.

Coinbase is very much a crypto bank with all the pitfalls that dealing with a bank entails. Its users sacrifice control for convenience and pay a premium for the privelage. That said, they’re probably the most reliable fiat on ramp/off ramp there is, but not your keys, not your coins, etc. 
If you’re not a true believer but want some exposure to crypto, coinbase is actually a pretty decent starting point.

No false assumption here. Just responding to a post about investment with a post about investment. Your strategy of not exiting bitcoin is still a decision about how to handle the question of when to sell. Never is a valid answer. 
Thus: pick your strategy and stick to it, enjoy the ride.


Oh look. An example of exactly what I was talking about. 
The term “exit strategy” doesn’t just mean exchanging bitcoin for fiat, it just means deciding when and how to take a portion your gains off paper. That’s it.
@_date: 2019-05-18 19:50:39
Storing it in a bank safe is literally what I’m talking about. It’s literally hiring a bank to handle security for you. Also, making as many copies as you want is pointless if you misspell something or misunderstand something. Plus, additional copies represent heightened security risk. 
Again, not suggesting in any way that hardware wallets and retaining personal control of your keys is a bad thing. If you know what you’re doing, it’s almost always more secure. But by numbers literally half of the population is dumber than average and the other half I think its a stretch to suggest that they’re majority technically inclined. 
If bitcoin is to become ubiquitous, it has to be useable for stupid or non technical people.

1.	Current and historical price data paint a reasonably clear picture of healthy demand for bitcoin. It ebbs and flows, obviously, but what indicators are you looking at that suggest demand will suddenly vanish? 
2.	We don’t know what we don’t know, but I think your critiques ignore what a powerful position bitcoin holds. All it needs to do to retain its market position is to continue existing. Network effects are particularly strong with money, and bitcoin is the far and away the most successful digitally native asset with the most robust and secure network. In order to be supplanted by another coin, that coin would need to basically be better at being bitcoin than bitcoin is (a secure, unforgeable, global blockchain) *and* there would need to reason to want to stop holding bitcoin. So far there has been no demonstrably superior digitally native asset, and bitcoin has given no compelling reason for anyone who holds it to migrate away from it. The entire market moves with it. 
3.	The Myspace Facebook migration happened pretty early on in the social media lifecycle. I’m not saying it couldn’t happen, but every day that bitcoin remains king it becomes harder to dethrone.

Pick your exit point, stick to it. 
But definitely set aside something to FOMO in with if you spot a trend early. Dip out after you take some profits. Buy more bitcoin. Stick to predetermined exit strategy. Exit strategy might be a house, a lambo, may not be fiat, may be an amount of fiat, but paper gains aren’t gains at the end of the day. If you don’t take profit at some point you’re just donating your gains to someone else who will.

Most coins available for purchase on exchanges are newly mined coins.

Okay? Bitcoin isn’t the hersheys chocolate guy, its a digital asset following a predictable log trend over 10 years. Do you have any data to suggest this time *is* different or are you relying solely on anecdotes to justify your position? 
Btw, that statement isn’t to suggest that it *cant* be different this time, but it is to suggest you better make sure your reasoning is solid before you defy trends. Anecdotes about Hershey guy aren’t going to cut it for me.
Personally when I see that log trend and look at current market conditions surrounding bitcoin, ie, Fidelity, BAKKT, continuing development of the protocol, historically high trade volume, fewer bad actors in the space, google trends indicating record interest in bitcoin, etc, it looks more likely to continue the trend than break it.

Yeah if you switched phones you lost your tokens. No fun cause no matter what you're dealing with support. I recently had a similar problem here's what you should do: 
1. Use your printed QR code or recovery code. This is the easiest way to do it. I'm guessing you don't have one though, but going forward keep them on hand. 
2. Start account recovery with Authy. Should take about a day but they'll restore your codes of you backed them up. If you didn't back them up with Authy or if it still didn't work you'll need to go to the next step.
3. Coinbase can help you regain access of it still isn't working. You'll need a fresh browser ( incognito works if you don't want to clear your cache and cookies) and a decent webcam. When you log in it'll ask for your 2FA token. Underneath where you would input the token there will be a link that says "lost your authenticator app?". Click that. From there it'll ask for a DL or photo id which you must take from your comps webcam. Then it'll be 24 to 72 hours to verify your identity. They usually just revert your 2FA setting to whatever it was before so if it's SMS you'll get a text if it's Authenticator you'll need to open the app etc.

Big difference between Gox and Coinbase. Gox was a stupid magic card site that sold Bitcoin. Coinbase is kyc aml compliant, us based, and trying to play things by the book. Tbh, I think it's a LOT more risky to be fiddling around with paper wallets and the like as a complete noob. While it's important to learn to manage your own keys, and if you're dealing with life changing amounts you're an idiot if you leave it all in one place under control of a third party, it just isn't necessary for most people right away. Coinbase has been around for ages and while there's always risk leaving it with a third party, I also think people around here tend to minimize the risk involved with mangaging their own keys.

Prediction courtesy of my ass: slightly bumpy ride up to 10k until Fidelity opens, quick spike to near ATH followed by a FOMO run to 50kish, then massive institutional grade profit taking, pushing the price down to 10k where it’ll wallow for the next few months until people start opening too many shorts again, causing whales and institutions to lick their chops. 
Or it’ll rocket to 80k in a straight shot. Or it’ll go sideways until the end of the year. Or Trump will bomb Iran causing turmoil in the broader markets triggering the Second Great Depression or possibly WW3 forcing people to look for uncorrelated safe haven assets like Bitcoin, meaning a bumpy ride to 300-500k. Or the Chinese tariffs will finally start kicking consumers in the teeth to similar effect sans WW3 with a lower ceiling of 200k.

I just bought my first BTCs over the past week, and for a few days prior to that I was bit annoyed at how difficult it was to actually buy some. For whatever reason, I didn't find out about Coinbase until later on, and logging in, verifying the account, and making the purchase was smooth as butter ( unfortunately, I timed the purchase perfectly to coincide with the recent peak. :/ Not all that upset about it since I consider it a long term investment. I've been eyeballing bitcoin since, like, 2010, and I've regretted not dropping the 100 bones I was going to drop on it for the hell of it every single time I've thought about it since, which has been like every 6 months or so. )

*psst*, your anti-Americanism is showing. 
The issue isn't SI prefixes. Americans use them all the time when talking about money, bits, or bytes. The problem is, and I don't think this rub is limited to Americans, that worldwide people are used to measuring their wealth in whole numbers.
People understand the concept of "mBTC" well enough, but I've had to explain to more than one person that buying 1 BTC is actually buying 100,000,000 satoshi. Most average Joes I've spoken to about it aren't thrilled with the idea of exchanging hundereds of dollars for what, in their minds, amounts to bit change. Shortsighted? Lazy? Sure. But entirely understandable.
Its an accessibility issue, that's all. And one that is *actually* slowing adoption. By how much, I couldn't begin to say, but I know a lot of people who already feel out in the cold because one whole BTC is too expensive for them. Anecdotal? Sure. But we also heard testimony during the senate hearing from one guy who doesn't understand it that well suggesting that BTC will never be the go to because "there aren't enough of them".

I don't really know that it *is* that risky for a poor person. 15k in savings will cover a car emergency or two, a medical emergency, and a housing emergency, but its not going to secure someone for any real length of time. Lose your job or catch a tough illness that requires treatment for a good while, and you find that 15k will evaporate *REAL* fast, and will do little more than postpone the inevitable descent into poverty.
The truth is with the job market the way it is, and with wages stagnating or falling, the kind of hard work that enables a cashier to save 15k, the, careful scrimping and saving is incapable of elevating someone from the working poor into the middle class. 
Life is too expensive now.
But a risky bet? That other people are placing big money? That has the possibility to absolutely blow up?

Paradigm shift? No, not anywhere close. Bitcoin was largely dismissed and derided until recently by most investors as some kind of silly fad. What's different over the past few months or so is that many of them are really coming around to crypto in general because media discussion is MUCH more informed than it used to be. Maybe it's that they got sick of having egg on their faces by dismissing the best performing investment of the past few years time and again, I don't know, but regardless now that its being taken more seriously we've got a bunch of new people who want in. 
I think there's an expectation that once things get rocky there will be a mass exodus and the price will drop, hence all the bubble talk lately. I'm sure it'll come down, but I'm just as certain it will go back up. I think the big difference isnt widespread adoption as much as it is a somewhat broader understanding of what cryptos are and an inkling of the absurd potential in what it could become. 
We aren't anywhere near a new paradigm. That would require a revolution in the way people think about money and being a hodler since late 2013, I can say definitively that it has changed the way *I* think about money and especially the way I think about netsec. 
I agree with the camp that believes this is adoption more than it is a bubble. The paradigm shift will be when your grandma is talking about paper wallets and safe deposit boxes  and secure passwords around the bingo table because she doesn't want to lose her bitcoin or ether. 
Imo this is just price discovery. It's still gonna swing pretty wildly because there isn't anywhere near the liquidity the market needs but that will come in time. That liquidity, btw, will also translate directly into a much higher price. 
Also full disclosure I'm just a hobbyist so take everything I'm saying for a grain of salt, I just think there's a ton of room to grow. I mean hell, Japan, India, Korea are just getting started, you know? Those are huge markets. 
Of course, all of this is contingent on the scaling issue being resolved soon, but even if bitcoin bites the dust, litecoin, ether, and others will be around. The money isn't going to leave crypto, imo, unless the entire experiment turns out to be based on a completely flawed piece of reasoning that noone has tripped over yet. 
Also, the enthusiasm here is just... So much more muted than the  2014 bubble. People seriously thought we were headed to the moon in one shot back then. We are nowhere near that level of hysteria.

I learned about it from a Reddit comment around 2010ish or so. I was thinking about throwing 100 bucks at it just in case it became something but never bothered to figure out how to do it or how to mine. It was always in the back of my mind though. In 2011 I got deployed and figured I'd throw a grand at it when I got home. I didn't get around to actually learning about it until the end of 2012 though, and I managed to finally get into it just before it took off. 
I think I read about it on the technology subreddit or something like that. I love cool tech and I was distantly interested in it because there comments seemed to indicate this wasn't just "internet money" . Once I actually spent the time to learn about it I realized how important it had the potential to be and Ive been kicking myself ever since for not doing a deep dive initially.

If bitcoin is going to reach moon status its simply going to have to get nice and cozy with preexisting capital. Coinbase, for all its flaws, is pretty well positioned to spearhead integration into markets where it can make a difference. CTOs need to talk to someone, after all. 
Even if bitcoin were to absorb the entire remittance market, it isn't going to absorb the current players in the market, won't absorb the brands themselves and it isn't just going to push capital out of the way. Who knows? Maybe western union is thinking about eventually positioning themselves as a competitor to coinbase where people can buy bitcoin, have wallets, send it anywhere etc. *Including* to luddites or old people or people who might actually never make use of bitcoin itself because old habits die hard.

Simliarity alone won't kill a currency. LTC is a prime example of that. Its adoption appears to be *spreading*, despite that its nearly identical to XBT, with some arguable benefits and some arguable defects. Counterintuitive? Maybe. But I think that has more to do with the hashrate becoming too difficult too quickly making perfectly usable mining hardware obsolete too quickly. At least, too quickly for the people who sunk their cash into mining rigs and want *some* ROI on their investment. 
The network effect is everything to cryptocurrency, and LTC has been beneficiary of a LOT of old mining hardware from the early BTC days. It inherited the old network, and that's the same network that powered the silk road. LTC asics are already under development, and what that says to me is LTC isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Only shit development will derail it at this point.
(BTW, I'm of the belief that while the Silk Road was a liability for widespread adoption, it was *essential* to the development of crypto currency in that it demonstrated that XBT can function *exactly* as intended in, literally, the most cutthroat, paranoid, untrustworthy economic sector in the world.) 
Where the old miners go next after Asics rule LTC is anybody's guess, but I'd wager that it will probably be another cryptocurrency.
That said, XBT and LTC are going to be the big two. There may be another, but they have the first mover advantage. Once the dust has settled and people are familiar and comfortable with cryptos, I can see a superior competitor emerging to challenge for day to day use, and while that may *affect* the price of XBT and LTC or whatever comes after, I don't really see it destroying them altogether. 
I think there will be a variety of crypto currencies used for a variety of purposes. I actually can't see how XBT will become the only game in town, truth be told, try as I might. The USD may be the worlds reserve currency, but every country has a bill in the game, you know?
XBT will probably be the reserve crypto, LTC will probably be a sort of pound sterling, but its anybodys guess what will come next.
*also interesting, is what XBT has appeared to do with mining rigs is establish an on ramp, of sorts, for additional currencies to enter the market. The inheritor to LTC hardware is probably going to be the number 3..

Fellow dreamer stuck in a mind numbing job here, too, my friend. Bitcoin's grabbed hold of my imagination like things haven't in a long time and it feels really damn good to think I may have the opportunity to watch the world change from ground level, and maybe make a little money in the process.

You need to learn how bitcoin works which inevitably means digging through piles of information. It’s obvious you have no idea what a 51% attack is or how it happens and so quit being lazy and go do your research.
But, since I don’t want you to feel like you’re not getting an answer to your question: yes. Things have been done to prevent a 51% attack. Links are in the sidebar.

So, you actually need to open the website in incognito mode, use a different browser, or clear your cache and cookies. I opted to do the incognito mode because it was easier. 
Once you navigate there in incognito it'll have you login like normal, then when it asks for your 2FA token you'll see right underneath the entry form there are a couple of links, one of which is the "lost your authenticator app?" link. 
Click that, it'll get the ball rolling.
Again, incognito mode is key.

Someone created a global decentralized trustless digital cash that has *the ability* to bypass banking infrastructure entirely. But just like regular cash there are *significant* inherent risks with holding and protecting your entire fortune yourself. This community argues frequently “not your keys not your coin”, and that’s true, but it very quickly glosses over the reality that people who aren’t tech savvy really are better off leaving their money in the hands of a third party custodian whose entire job is to keep their money safe. 
Even a hardware wallet isn’t enough. Keys can be lost. Seed phrases destroyed or forgotten. Theres wrench attacks, there’s *significant* room for user error, etc. That last one is routinely shrugged off by users here because there’s a degree of tech literacy required to be in bitcoin at this stage. Most people aren’t there and never will be. They need to have access to bitcoin, though.
You can’t expect your grandma who struggles with a freaking ipad to tackle seed phrase storage and generation, hot and cold wallets, let alone multisig, samirs secret sharing, or other infosec techniques needed to individually secure crypto. I think it’s actually irresponsible to encourage people at large to do this. 
And, honestly, that’s the reason banks came into being in the first place. People kept losing their fortunes to theft or incompetence so some people decided to make it their job to keep money safe. *Bitcoin wasn’t invented to subvert that notion*. It was created to sidestep the increasingly incestuous relationship between fractional reserve lenders and government, and to provide an open source, algorithmic, hard money alternative to the strictly political control of monetary policy by central banks.

No, I didn't get anything in my pm at all. I was looking at a list of commands for bitcointip, and one of them happened to be "ACCEPT". So, after I'd created the account and noticed the balance was zero, I sent the command "ACCEPT", and waited. I received a response sayin "all pending transactions have been processed", and my balance remained zero. 
I received another tip later on that went through no problem at all. I'm convinced it was an error in syntax during the initial tip.

Nobody *really* knows. There's good reason for optimism, though. That said, Bitcoin is a *very* risky investment at this point. The biggest threat to it is probably regulatory, and since the government doesn't much like things it can't control directly, its a cointoss whether or not it'll have a chance at widespread adoption in the US, or if it will be snuffed out of existence entirely. That said, its taking hold all over the world, and *that* is why I bought in. 
I was in the same boat as you, though. Kicking myself for not buying earlier. That has happened every time I've forgotten about and revisited bitcoin. For me, I'm tired of kicking myself. I'm buying and holding. If it tanks, I'll buy low. But I'm not going to lament buying high, because I'm confident in the direction this is going. The more I know and learn about bitcoin, the more I think its here to stay. Its to currency what tcp/ip is to the internet. Only question is if greed will win out over decentralization. 
If the state of torrents today are any indication, I kinda doubt it will.

On the otherhand, Microsoft has only been around since 1987. I guess you could *still* consider the price of microsoft stock a bubble, since it could *still* conceivably crash to zero, but I think you'd be wrong. 
1987 was 25 years ago. Bitcoin has been around for 5 years. Microsoft's net worth is, what, 250 billion dollars? BTC in total is worth like 3 or 4 billion? 
Look, I don't know if this is a bubble or not, but I think eventually people need to realize that rapid growth does NOT automatically mean there's a bubble. Things can increase in value *dramatically* over a very short period of time, as people collectively realize the worth and utility of a thing.

Honestly, what puts me off about it right now are the transaction fees. I could care less about peoples ideologies, its the utility of it that drew me to it, and its the potential that has me bullsih. But the transaction fees are too high. They make it infeasible to send small amounts here and there, which will hinder the widespread adoption of BTC as a currency for day to day transactions. 
I mean, we have the  benefit of a currency who's smallest unit is the satoshi, and yet to send a transaction smaller than .01 BTC (2 dollars) will cost you 0.0001 BTC (2 cents).  A satoshi is 0.00000001 bitcoin. So, if BTC continues to grow in value (this is longer term, btw), the satoshi will have to become the base transactional unit, not the BTC proper.  In that case, any transaction smaller than 1,000,000 satoshi will cost you 10,000 satoshi to process. If the Satoshi eventually has the same worth of a penny (unrealistic, but not outside the realm of probability), that turns into a prettty damn steep transaction fee.
In real terms today, I sent a .001  to my blockchain wallet from my main wallet. But I can't send that .001 anywhere now. I can't even send .0009 back. It keeps telling me "insufficient funds.". Which is doubly annoying because it tells me I have .001 available for spending. 
Now, I'm not planning on making tons of microtransactions and all, but I *do* feel like I should be able to send a quarter to another wallet if I need to.
So, right now, that's my beef with bitcoin. I'm new, though, so please tell me why my concerns are without basis. 
What I like? Everything else. One of the biggest ancillary benefits of bitcoin is its kinda forcing me to learn how to take encryption seriously. Its got me thinking very VERY carefully about how to safe guard my digital life, and I expect this will be invaluable knowledge in the nearish future. I'm sure our kids are going to be baffled that we did *anything* online unencrypted at any point. 
Also, I love the deflationary aspects of it, and the accessibility of it. No credit checks. No forms. No *forms*. Just plain, raw, digital cash.
Very curious to see how people smarter than I am harness it, too. Curiousity, I think, is the biggest draw. Are we really at the beginning of global finance 2.0?

Yeah, third time was the charm for me. I lazied myself out of a little 100 dollar speculative investment in 2010, saw that it had gone up in 2012 while on deployment, then talked to my buddy a couple months ago who was doing pretty well on it. Told him "You know, I need to put money in this. I keep seeing it go up, and I keep saying the same shit. Its always "I wish I woulda.." with Bitcoin. I don't understand it the way I'd like and I need to do my research, but I'm going to do it. Sometime. I'm sure i'll wish I did it earlier when I get around to it." 
Sometime happened to be almost a week ago, after the price had jumped buy 150 percent. 
Prophecy fulfilled. But I'm in, now. I'm too poor to not hitch myself to this rocket. If it fails, I'm still just as poor as I was, living paycheck to paycheck. If it succeeds, I just set myself up for life.

I'm probably not the guy to ask. I'm no financial adviser, just someone who's been interested in it. But, for the record, I bought a few. Only thing I would recommend, and I feel comfortable passing this on because its sound advice that was recommended to me, is buy only as much as you can afford to lose. Consider the money spent entirely when you buy BTC. 
ALSO, and this is some other good advice that's worth keeping in mind: the time to make high risk investments is when you're young. Once you get older, you, of necessity, will have to behave more cautiously. So if you've got youth on your side and some disposable income, go for it.

Just need a little clarification:
If I boot into an ubuntu livecd conncted to the internet and install electrum via download, if I want to create a secure paper wallet, do I need to disconnect the ethernet cable first to create a secure seed? Or does electrum need to be online to generate the seed?
Also,  if I've booted into a livecd and downloaded elctrum, am I already potentially exposed to the point where disconnecting the ethernet is a waste of time?
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:04:02

Well, I'm hesitant to use bitaddress.org or vanitygen. Heard a few stories about self chosen brainwallets being hacked, so I'm a bit reticent to bother with bitaddress.org or any sort of vanity brainwallet generator. I realize that utilizing diceware in conjunction with bitaddress.org can generate a secure brainwallet seed, but I don't have a 16 sided die and I have yet to hear of an electrum seed being hacked, so that's the direction I'm headed.
I mean, I realize I'm being fairly paranoid and all, but I'm basically trying to think of the best way to generate a long term paper savings wallet. I like the idea of a determinstic seed rather than a pure brainwallet/diceware wallet, and electurm appears to be the easiest of the programs to use that way. 
I'm just trying to figure out if disconnecting the ethernet cable after downloading electrum while running a livecd, and leaving it is a good way to ensure security, or if the very fact of downloading anything at all during a livecd session compromises the security of a potential seed, you know? And, furthermore, if electrum *needs* to have access to the internet in order to log onto a server to send and receive funds?
Also a little fuzzy on how to utilize master public keys via electrum, but I think that'll be the next thing to focus on after I figure out and trust my first ironclad wallet, you know?

@_date: 2013-10-27 13:39:29
So, I'm pretty new to this, too, and I'm still wrapping my brain around it. But what I gather is that your main wallet generates little subwallets during the course of a transaction. Those are change wallets. To create a paper wallet, you send money to one of those temporary wallets, and print it off.
I'm hoping someone who knows better can fill in the gaps for me. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:06:09
Its no more a threat to the dollar than gold or silver. 
The major threat to bitcoin is regulatory/tax/surveillance related. 
The government likes knowing who sends money where, and Bitcoin makes it *much* harder to "follow the money", and *much* easier to transfer large amounts of wealth anonymously, and to launder, which makes it ideal for criminal enterprise/groups that the US doesn't like so much. Silk road is a good example of that. DPR was busted with good old fashioned detective work. The blockchain told them nothing. 
If they can't find a way to monitor it, I wouldn't be surprised they attempt *massive* regulatory pressure that makes cryptocurrency in general difficult to use stateside. 
What it needs to survive the regulatory pressure is a robust network. Its not there yet, but it will be soon. If crypto currency has gained enough of a foothold worldwide to mitigate the regulatory threat posed by heavy handed response to black market activity, then the Fed has no choice but to regard it as a new reality rather than a toy they can crush.
The other thing working in our favor are the potential dollar signs flashing in the eyes of the bankers. They *love* the anonymizing properties of BTC, they can see the potential of the protocol as a platform for innovation, and they're recognizing that the currency has what it takes to stand on its own two feet. Plus, the political wing of the bankers, the lobbyists and the PACs, I'm sure, are *really* liking its potential as a device for anonymous campaign contribution. Since they pull the purse strings, write the laws, and they're curious to see what happens, I believe this will stall the security apparatus long enough to allow the network to grow beyond the kind of regulation that can destroy it in the US.  
The other reason why I doubt the fear will come from the fed, is that the bankers can buy it as easily as anyone else. Why be afraid of something you can just... buy?
In any case, *that* is how I see it panning out. I'd be surprised if it was the US seeing it as a threat to its monetary hegemony. By the time BTC becomes a *real* threat to the dollar, it will be completely impossible for the Fed to stop.
But who knows? I could be flat wrong.
