I figured there had to be a way to buy portions. Since $7000 would be pretty steep entry level. It is interesting. I think I’m old fashioned and would rather invest in things with an appearance of being more tangible.

Well even the stock market what are people really buying anyhow. That’s why I say the appearance of something tangible. I don’t really do much stock investing. My wife and I dabble more in real estate. That’s one thing that certainly isn’t ever going to be digital. Unless people figure out how to download themselves.

I wonder how well you could sell one for $7000 let alone hundreds of thousands at that amount. If that’s the going rate and what they sell at it just be true. Though something is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it and I find it hard to imagine many people willing to pay that.

Yeah we’ve had to borrow and I’m not sure that is something I would want to risk with bitcoin or even the stock market. You would have to have a extremely high level of certainty. Real estate typically isn’t going to go anywhere and some sweat equity can help protect or raise the value. It’s really mostly personal preferences.

I haven’t looked into it much in all honesty. It’s a passing curiosity. Even if I was more interested now I imagine I would have to go in with a group of people even to buy one. So it’s basically priced itself out of being any use to me. That is without researching further to see if only fractions of a bitcoin can be purchased. Still the US dollar economy still functions well enough for me.
