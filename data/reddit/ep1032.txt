you could potentially limit access for any new nodes until they've served X content, and then each node could be tracked by its Up/Down ratio like a normal torrent user.  Nodes that fall beneath a certain ratio are banned from the network, until they've moved above the ratio again.
If you can then also randomize what content each node has the ability to push to the network, it might work?

Why?  My understanding was the reason bitcoin went viral in China was because it was pegged as a way to 1) Store money outside of Chinese currency, 2) Move currency out of the nation in a way the Chinese government hadn't caught up with yet 3) Speculation.
1 would continually increase the price.  2 Would cause the price to correct, but only after people had set up bank accounts internationally, which is difficult with bitcoin.  I mean, coinbase still takes 6 days.  So you're looking at a lot of lag time there, even if  is the driving factor.

I understand your point, but you're talking about the tech elite again.  The tech elite will just move their servers out of the country.  But this price bump came from the average person selling off.

Is the hold up just on usd?  Can i mtgox to japanese yen, then wire transfer?

IF I transfer 1 bitcoin to MtGox, then Sell it on MtGox, does that mean my MtGox account will have ~1130 USD, that will stay there until I attempt to withdraw the USD (which will take several months because MtGox is short on USD)?
Does that mean if I decide an hour later that I really shouldn't have sold, and wish to buy again, I can retransfer the ~1130 to a new bitcoin with no delay?

Yeah, but the entire thread is talking about the deflationary aspect.  I wouldn't expect paypal to replace the USD, but that doesn't mean I discount paypal as a joke.  Yes, it is insanely cool we can have a discussion about the replacement of the USD, but not to the extent that we completely ignore actual known values like the above.
imho
