felt kinda iffy about unloading some LTC last night and putting that much more into BTC... till I came here *glasses and finger guns*
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:43:26
such an eloquent repurpose.. so dimension. such depth
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:01:10

Major Dip is the dude on the left isn't it

I'd argue that HODL is the 5th rule here..
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:30:34
tip not dip
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:40:46
whats that step by step to buying BTC? “watch it go up, curse yourself for not getting it, watch it go up some more, 
curse yourself again, hopefully finally buy at some point”

@_date: 2017-11-20 21:22:18
do I down vote this? orrr....?
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:02:57
so please forgive my newbness.. when i finally get someone to pay me to do a project for bitcoin (i record local musicians/bands) how do we settle on a price? is it the USD amount converted to whatever the price of btc is at that time? or just a percentage of btc regardless of value at time of payment?
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:26:40
thats kinda what I'm assuming people do when you see coffee shops or grocery stores "accepting Bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:58:40
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:57:53
the only questions we need to concern ourselves with is which color lambos are we all inevitably buying
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:07:47

@_date: 2018-02-04 15:44:48
I think you're thinking of flame decals
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:43:55
im very unsure about what happens but im in for the ride.. kinda exhilarating. i did tower of terror for the first time a few weeks ago.. feels a lot like that
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:57:18
why try to reason w irrational thoughts.. just let natural selection run its course
