With any new technology there is always going to be a time when it will have it's faults and this will be one of them kinds of technology where they will need to release it and have it used to find it's faults and get them fixed. It may suck now but in time the faults will be fixed and things will start to get better.
@_date: 2014-05-04 18:38:01
