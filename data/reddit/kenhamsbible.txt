What I don't quite understand is how can you be sure that a long term investment in bitcoin will pay off under those circumstances. Sure Bitcoin might be improved upon and mature into a stable currency but it might as well be replaced by a number of other possible competitors.
Crypto is here to stay but as and investment wouldn't it be more wise to bet on a company using blockchain technology that you like instead of investing in a specific coin?

I would be happier about that than Kim Jong un.

I wrote a paper too but stupidly didn't buy any.

Maybe don't put me on the spot and be so defensive about it and try to open the dialogue for more people instead of calling them idiots.

I don't get how a dogmatic all regulations are bad stance makes for a better market. Isn't it just as stifling to have huge up and downswings that are caused by shady groups or people? 
Notice how you started arguing with me after I simply stated that bitcoin is an unregulated market. I think you just have a really hard stance against regulations of any kind which I find kind of baffling. I would agree with you that you can over regulate or that the effects of any form of regulation should be heavily analysed but I just don't see how unregulated equals good in your mind.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:47:50
I disagree on that second part.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:57:54
Ok way to romanticise that time period but you get what I meant by that metaphor.  I am sure there were some things that went great in that period but I do think that most people would prefer to live today.

I didn't lose any money and I am quite confident that I will profit long-term. It's just a fact that there are people manipulating the price of bitcoin using big buy/sell orders that they don't follow through with. That is not possible in a more regulated market and is in fact illegal.

You are much more disillusioned with politics than I am but you would call that naive I guess. 
The fact that your beliefs about crypto currencies and their larger implications are so deeply rooted in your mistrust in politics as a whole and your  disillusionment with the current systems doesn't make you appear very level headed though. I can emphasize with your positions to some degree but I don't think crypto is everything you wish it was or at least not yet.
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:29:59
But the system isn't completely fucked up. I don't think we are at that point yet where we should reject all that so hard. There is still the possibility for political activism, dialogue, education etc. Many people still live in democracies and not just on paper.
By taking such a hard anti government stance you are also kind of locking yourself out of ever participating in or trying to improve the process of governing.
The democratic uses of blockchain technology for example won't do much good if you expect that if you just give people the technology a new and better system will form on it's own.
Dialogue is important and the government in for example the USA or the EU should be part of the dialogue.

Well you called those people idiots and by extension me for defending them I guess. I don't think they are just too dumb and it's just their fault that they lost their stuff. I get that a lot of the appeal of crypto currencies is the unregulated nature. But government is bad and should stay away sounds like a simplistic view to me.
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:11:27
What I perceive as bad is that there are still a lot of scenarios where someone can get pretty fucked with nowhere to turn to in the crypto world and it's not productive to just say that was their fault then. 
Also I would not completely discredit the idea that a government or authority can regulate a new market without completely fucking it up for most people. That seems like an extreme stance to me.

Maybe you have to be radical if you want to institute real change but I don't feel like being radical. Maybe that makes me a centrist which is kind of an assholish position in itself. Honestly I am not very formed in my convictions yet so arguing with you guys on a bitcoin subreddit will not be very fruitful anyways. I am trying to take something with me from discussions like this but it is easy to not take people with stronger beliefs  seriously sometimes especially from my position. I am extremely sheltered and I have very little perspective on what it's like anywhere outside of a European middle class life aside from what it see through the internet like on reddit.
For what it's worth I bought crypto currencies because I do believe that they are a step forward for everyone and that they do represent the cutting edge of technology influencing society. But I also bought into it because I just think it's cool or interesting and maybe with the thought of making some money or spending my bitcoin someday once they are accepted everywhere.

I mean you can't just tell people they are stupid for trading crypto currencies because they should just hodl. You also never lose your money in stocks if you never sell technically but those markets are still regulated for the benefit of the traders and general fairness.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:26:48
What I meant is that some of the practices that seem to be going on around crypto trading would be very illegal in other more regulated markets. The way big investors are manipulating the bitcoin price would get people in jail if they were manipulating stock prices.

I didn't start the discussion and to me a lot of his comments came off as not very convincing but remarkably zealous.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:07:11
And very unregulated markets.

You must be Neo then...
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:07:11
And very unregulated markets.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:46:04
 I guess that is a point but I don't see why that makes a completely unregulated wild west situation more desirable.
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:44:56
It's probably not Bitcoin that will be regulated anyway. More probable that a government backed crypto currency will pop up eventually and it will have it's pros and cons just like bitcoin. 
I also don't think that the crypto community as a whole doesn't seem to show that much of a desire to be so revolutionary or disruptive. If that were the case I could see how the bitcoin community could actually push bitcoin more into that direction you are talking about.
And yes the fact that a government has an army and an executive branch and a whole system in place to make sure it's policies etc get enacted arguably helps with the creation of sound money I think.
