Sure Bitcoin is less than the financial sector and FIAT, that is a step forward, but it is still 8.9 MILLON times more energy intensive per transaction than Nano.
Bitcoin is awesome but it's energy efficiency is not something to brag about. It's like saying, 'burning coal is terrible (FIAT) so we will burn gas instead (Bitcoin) but let's continue to ignore the solar and wind renewables (Nano).'
In a world that is breaking heat ratings every year, coral reefs are being bleached, ice caps are melting, and CO2 is becoming a significant concern, we CANNOT afford to be delusional about inefficient energy consumption. If there are better alternatives for energy production and efficiency we MUST progress towards them else the major cities of the world will be under water, the oceans will die, and humans will suffer greatly.

Bitcoin sure does have it's utility, it is unmatched in security. But energy efficiency, no matter how you or Andre antonopolus spins it, is still incredibly inefficient and wasteful. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:03:14
Likewise, I would take security as well but I believe they both serve their own purposes. You want security for you savings account (Bitcoin) but want speed and efficiency for your daily transactions (Nano). That being said, I don't make many of any payments directly from my savings account. So the energy consumption of Bitcoin would fall dramatically if it was used for savings and not everyday transactions. Best of both worlds 
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:45:06
LN is impractical, no business is going to want to stay online 24/7 to receive payments let alone fund the channel. LN is a niche, a second layer addition that's grasping at straws.

The way I see it, this is actually a bad thing. When people speculate that BTC is going to worth more in the future they hold onto it. That makes the price go up. From now until mid 2019 these BTC will be forced to be held onto, no choice of the matter. So the prices will have better odds to improve.
But when 2019 rolls around, BTC could be $20,000 or more, the BTC would be returned to the people which is right, just, and better overall but that also means not 100% will be saved like this next year, so there will be some sell pressure again. I'll be curious how this all plays out.

Typically I would argue for the true competitive spirit, let the best technology and developers fight for the throne. However, right now it is CRITICAL for bitcoin to stay as the leader. Cryptocurrencies are becoming popular and more readily adopted on word of mouth alone. 
If bitcoin is dethroned the following will happen, all all are negative consequences:
1. Investors who spoke about bitcoin to introduce other investors into the market will be made a fool. The word of mouth will severely slow as uncertainty takes over.
2. Large entities such as countries, corporations, hedge funds, ETFs, will retract from the cryptocurrency market for a year or two due to its uncertainty and lack of financial security. Big money needs to e reassured their investment will not be washed away by a handful of greedy developers.
3. Companies will retract their bitcoin payment options due to uncertainty. Larger corporations like Steam, Newegg, and Microsoft will require a large amount of effort to change their payment structures to bitcoin cash (as sad as it is). The effort to change their wallet, websites, etc. is not worth the effort if the market cannot decide a standard currency.
4. Cryptocurrencies will lose confidence in future and current investors world wide for a plethora of reasons: cryptocurrencies are insecure, can easily be ‘attacked’ or ‘hacked,’ a small handful of people can control everything, pyramid scheme, you name it.
Point is - in 5 to 10 years from now when cryptocurrencies are more readily established and are widely understood by the public - fight for the throne all you want. In 2017 and 2018 this is destructive to cryptocurrencies as a whole, and of the point is to reinvent currencies and to redistribute wealth and power away from the centralized elite - BCH’s attack is the exact greed that has plagued the human race since the invention of fiat currencies.

-bought bitcoin after aug. 1st
-bought bitcoin and didn’t buy the equal amount of BCH
-sold their BCH
-have their BCH locked up in an uncooperative exchange
-refuse to support the moral integrity of BCH developers
-cannot buy BCH due to region restrictions
-were gifted BTC and not BCH
Point is - most people probably do not have N equal amount of BCH to BTC anymore - the fork was nearly 4 months ago now - there has been ALOT of BTC purchased in that time, hence it went from ~2500 to $8200.
So it is false to say that people should have BCH.

I want to focus on one aspect of your comment, that is the American people shouldn't support Bitcoin being a global currency. Because IF Bitcoin became backed instead of the USD, the United States would be in so much trouble. American people would see hyper inflation, the infrastructure would deteriorate even faster due to high unemployment, and stores everywhere would close. The backed USD provides purchasing power or else that 21 trillion dollars of debt catches up and starts to crush the American economy from it's own weight. If BTC replaced USD as the primary backed currency, the United States would fall into a multiple decade long depression. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:41:08
This guy is an idiot. You really think the United States is just going to drop the USD for Bitcoin? The USD is a standard backer for a ton of currencies around the world.

Fairly quick, imo, bitcoin isn't anonymous like monero - you could easily see that one account holds it. Now if you mean, many many addresses all under the same entity- I'd imagine you'd have someone squelch that information on the internet - but that would be much harder to figure out.

Take these two scenarios for example: I bought $2000 of bitcoin. My value doubled as did bitcoin. I spent $2000 of BTC on target gift cards. I didn't lose a dime and I nearly got a years worth of groceries for free - took less than 1 week to pull that off.
I want to buy a video game, I waited till BTC hit an ATH and bought the game. That game might have costed you $60, it cost me $30. 
Because I changed currencies - the hours I worked is worth 50% more than yours.

I'm in the exact same situation as you, entered market at same time and bought a nano before I even understood what a blockchain was. My friend- whom I told to buy a hardware wallet decided to store his stuff on jaxx mobile phone app. Sure enough, got hacked lost a few k.
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:44:18
Here is the best scenario I can think of that you can 'make money' off of this opportunity. Someone correct me if I am wrong. 
Let's do a real world scenario and say you bought 1 BTC during this last dip, say 3 months rent (if your rent is $1000/mo, total of $3000). This BTC is ONLY for paying rent. As BTC goes up in value, from $3000 to $5000, you would have made ~$2000 or two months rent. At this time you can use that BTC for 5 months rent. Of course you still need to have ~$1000 per month coming in to pay your rent at this time.
Also, since your landlord has provided you this offer, he has an incentive to receive bitcoin. Use that to your advantage, you both understand the implications of Bitcoin and how to purchase it. Express to him that you will pay your rent in bitcoin only if your rent is lowered by ~10%. That $100 will cover the cost of the fees as well as save you some money every month.
**Important note: A situation like this needs to be defined in a written contract. I advise you make sure the documentation clearly states $900 worth of Bitcoin. Make sure your contract clearly states that you are allowed to pay $1000 fiat OR $900 Bitcoin, whichever YOU prefer. Make sure that proof of your transaction has occurred, both in your wallet as well as his and keep this documentation until you decide to move out.**
Pros: 
* Every dip is an opportunity for 'free' rent.
* You pay ~10% less in rent every month. 
* You support the BTC industry through active use
* You make your Landlord a (possibly) very rich man in 10 years. (Hey you're already paying him rent, why not do what is best for him?)
* BTC's price fluctuates a lot and the time you have to pay rent may not line up with dips.
* Requires a decent savings or large sum of money to use this method

It's this thought process that leaves you regretting not to follow new innovation. 'The old' systems may be more secure due to regulations but it doesn't mean they are superior.

The final transaction was through a gift card yes, but even when you buy gift cards you're using USD, it's not like gift cards is a currency.
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:31:09
The real value isn't what the coins worth in Fiat is, the real worth is what the users determine it to be. If one entity were to own 90% of BTC, I and a majority of others would say, 'this coin is centralized and controlled, let's find a new one.' 
While it could happen, it would be counter productive of the entity to do so - they would essentially spend an unimaginable amount of money to achieve nothing.
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:29:43
I'd say that response more or less proves my point. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:48:13
It's more or less that extra step is worth it when you figure in that your currency is appreciating.
This country is one step away from negative interest rates like Japan and Greece. Your bank account rewards you currently with .01% interest. 
That extra step to secure your money earns you ~30% ROI. Again the old system may be more secure, but your money is sitting still instead of working for you.
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:47:12
I am under the impression you managed to steal this BTC - I don't know how, but if you had rightly purchased it, there is no question you should know how to sell it. Why would I assist you in your theft?

This is or isn't about the size of the block or the LN. A larger block mean Bitcoin is more difficult to mine which is an advantage for Chinese miners. Larger blocksize centralizes the hashrate even more than it is now.
The more centralized the hashrate the further Bitcoin falls from Satoshi's original purpose of Bitcoin - A decentralized peer to peer exchange of currency.

-unable to perform transactions of one side is offline
I really wish BTC would start pushing towards what it is good at, security. Also easier to use wallets for the common person, email BTC, etc. Yes the future is bright but BTC is going to lose a lot of ground on ETH when institutional investments come in because ETH has utility, BTC doesn't.

Two things, cryptocurrencies don't just 'die' like everyone talks about. There has been a lot of faed projects but that's because the developers leave and the community doesn't pick it up. Heck, verge and BTG have had the worst possible attacks multiple times and they are still thriving.
Second, In the last year it has dropped from 70% dominance to 40%. While it's certainly not dying, the rest of the market is finding it's own worth. If BTC we're to have some catastrophic bug that killed the protocol the market wouldn't die - it would certainly drop another 50-60% and the ALTs would follow. Currencies would be really impacted but Smart Contract Platforms like Ethereum would probably pick up the pieces quickly.

No, plenty of coins perform better than BTC in % which allows for a greater return in Satoshis value due to amount you can purchase of said coin. For example, you buy 10,000 of coin X and it goes from .15 to .25 meanwhile BTC goes from 8,000 to 8,125. The ALT gained more Satoshi value, after it's organic rise you sell it back to gain more BTC.
I have done this many times, bought VTC for .75 sold at $10.00 gained nearly, Nano at .80 to $32.00 and LTC from $30 to $230. I'm currently attempting to do it again with COSS. Not a single one of them was a pump and dump, they just appreciated faster in the market rise than BTC did.
To your second comment, BTC doesn't do everything, it doesn't do the fast and free transactions of Nano, the smart contracts if ETH or the dividends of COSS or the supply chain utility of all those assets. BTC is a great store of value but limited to that. And all the money isn't going to go just to BTC some companies will be looking for other assets.

Unless you worked where I use to. Because my co-workers would print out an email to show it to me. They were all fifty years old and tech illiterate so, makes sense. But, glad I'm outta that place. Explaining a tablet to them was like Greek to a monkey.

Yeah, as basic as it gets. A basic support floor.

So who gets the money from the margined shorts? The exchange? The whales that pumped the price?

TA doesn't mean you know the future, it means you are using pattern recognition to make an educated guess. When it comes to making money it's just another tool to help your decision making. 
These wars and insults to TA is just shouting from the rooftops how uneducated and inexperienced of an investor you are. TA is common place amongst day traders and wall street investors, they are professionals at their job and making money in markets.
No one cares if you do not like TA or don't believe in it or even cannot use it correctly, you will be left behind others that are wise enough to use every tool around to their advantage.

And because you're so helpful, I'll test my luck with another question. If I were to buy bitcoin at an ATM, it gives me a QR code and paper for my bitcoin, correct? So can I buy now, secure the paper, and when Trezor is delivered, transfer the paper to the Trezor?
Also, if trezor goes bankrupt will my currency be secured still?
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:38:21
You're the best, I really appreciate your clarifications. I want to stop bothering you with questions but it's rare to find such direct answers. If I were to buy bit at an ATM, way for $115 (to cover transfer frees) and integrate that wallet to a place like CoinBase? Use CB to buy the trezor. And lastly use the ATM to buy and later put into tezor wallet.

Thank you so very much.

Follow up question - that ATM that takes my cash and trades bits, if the company goes under my bits are still valid, correct? That's how it should work but I've never used digital currencies before.

Generally speaking the faith of the CC market is based on BTC right now, if BTC crashes on Aug 1st then the others should be affected to. We have seen some deviations from the trend but generally still true.

"You fucking millennials have been coddled your whole lives and believe that every child deserves a trophy."
That comment makes no sense - think it through. You are blaming a younger generation for the parenting habits of an older generation. Did millennials campaign together everywhere demanding that they be coddled and given participation trophies? I don't remember any such widespread movement. 
Instead your generation (assuming you're the age to be a parent to a millennial) didn't have the parenting skills necessary and resorted to coddling an entire generation.

I guess that's where my confusion comes from - if s/he created bitcoin then obviously they would want BTC to succeed. If they began to move their BTC, my assumption, at least would be that they are trying to retire instead of crash it, why would someone do something so malicious to something they worked hard to achieve?
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:46:32
Can you explain your logic as to why?

Yea I hear ya. It just seemed weird to say the 'mark' would be the logo of bitcoin. Given it should be the opposite, since we believe that this technology is getting us away from the corruption of the banks.
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:03:54
I don't think you understood the reference. Biblical revelation &amp; mark of the beast -
'Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark'

Not all economy is destruction. Old economy based around oil was, however sustainable energy and develop is proof that economy doesn't need to be destructive

The second the US goes to negative interest rates like other countries have, ill put all my savings into BTC. Negative interest rates what a joke

Right now, I would say it would be best labeled as fear and uncertainty, in 10 years we could potentially see a 'war on cryptocurrencies.'
