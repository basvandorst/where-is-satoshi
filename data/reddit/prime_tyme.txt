Not saying you can't do it. You just can't "pull the trigger" like you could with other financial instruments
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:12:06
Since you piqued my interest on the subject hypothetically how many sell orders would you have to create to dump $30M ? And how fast would it take to have all the orders filled? 
Do you think you would be able to sell off $30M in bitcoins all at the same price?
I'm just saying easy as pulling a trigger means one price on one exchange with buyers immediately ready to purchase on the other side. 
Also, do you know how much average volume of BTC gets traded on a daily basis? According to bitcoinity the largest daily volume was $14m in one day. Do you think you could just do double that no problems ?

Thank you for justifying my statement that BTC markets do not yet have sufficient liquidity. No further questions. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:47:46
It would take more than one day for a sell off of that size . You would not get the same price for all of those orders
@_date: 2017-02-24 15:49:57
No kidding. Bitcoin markets have a severe lack of liquidity. Would be hard to just dump this amount of coins back on the market.

How is this different from an ICO to raise funds ? 
@_date: 2019-12-17 03:00:47
Lol dummies you should probably sell btc, especially when it is trending downward. You should sell it when it’s trending upwards
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:13:33
Yes especially the bank teller lady who I asked out on a date but she laughed at me because I only had $11.36 in my checking account 
@_date: 2019-01-20 00:20:59
Yeah except the price is very easily subject to manipulation and it’s value as an exchange for goods and services is directly tied to fiat

Nothing will happen. 
But Dimon said he would fire anyone in his company found trading crypto. Let's see him make good on his word and see some heads roll.

Wow u r just figuring this out congratulations

1) At some point US money supply will begin to contract (interest rates will go up)
2) Enter period of deflation
3) The'price' of fixed value commodities falls (but value goes up because less fiat in circulation)
A) massive gains we saw this year begin to look like regular gains (10-20% appreciation per year) and it's a longer road to $100K
B) If BTC becomes this valuable the USD will be largely worthless anyway
Important to think about how global currencies and monetary systems compete against each other when considering the mass adoption of BTC as an actual currency

Why didn't he borrow 300000 Bitcoins ?
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:17:16
If debt is issued at fixed instead of variable the US would have every incentive to raise rates.
Reminder China and many other large nations have debt issues as well.

Sold at $4000 earlier this week. Gonna jump back in around $3400~

Dimons are forever
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:48:05
Yessir! Lol, you're replying to a post from 3 weeks ago, but since BTC barely touched $3500 I jumped back in at $3600 and have been on the rocket ship since.
I've been pretty good at selling at the highs and buying back in at the lows but I always wonder if I would just be better off HODLing.
At least I'm providing liquidity to the market lol.

4 wat?
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:23:59
When can we start lending via BTC ?
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:32:23
Could have paid off all of our debt to China by trading them all that BitCoin

The only way you can earn them is through acts of patriotism and making the United States of America great again.

Yeah, but Americans got lazy. If the Japanese are going to do the same job for a 1/10th of the cost , hire the Japanese.

Thank GOD ALMiGHTY we have president Donald Trump in office to restore power - away from the elite and back into the hands of the American people. 
What a time to be alive! Liberty and justice for all!
