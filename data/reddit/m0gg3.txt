Someone who puts his money where his mouth is, respect!
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:07:56
Why? Oh because the price dipped slightly? We’ve had this atleast 1000 times already and it will rise 1000 times more. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:53:01
Same, haha! Although any donation for a greater good is a good donation! :-)

Good english.
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:22:51
Well price doesn’t go up by itself. The demand sets the price. If nobody wants to buy bitcoin at moon price, the price will drop!
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:36:53
Is this how you spend your friday nights?!
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:12:35
Sweet :-) 
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:10:47
You’re so dumb. Literally so dumb.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:54:46
I wonder this aswell...
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:13:49
Funny how I see you commenting each time we see a price drop,  spreading massive FUD, causing weak hands to panic sell :p youre the man!
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:57:15
why not? that's what me, my family, my friends and co-workers did. I even sold my dog :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:24:19
Naw. Shoving comments like ”people who bought over 6k is fucked” in peoples faces isn’t my definition of expressing an oppinion. You’re spreading panic among the sheep! Are you salty for panicselling at 1k? Is that why you’re doing this? :P
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:53:33
You didn’t?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:14:11
What? How can you jump to the conclusion that he’s robbing his father of ALL his money?! 
OP also said that his father was happy with the agreement? What’s your problem?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:10:27
get out of here
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:31:21


Is this how you spend your free time? Seriously?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:59:35
Zzz, don’t listen to this guy... this is probably someone who sold at 500$ and wants to spread his saltyness 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:09:10
What you're doing is not expressing an opinion, you're pushing misinformation up peoples faces.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:07:56
Lmao what are you on about?
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:28:11
Hahaha best shit I’ve ever seen
@_date: 2018-10-05 00:40:53
Wtf? Are you okay man? There’s SO much salt in this comment. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:05:31
Mining costs are way higher now and the yields are comparably low now due to the nature of bitcoins limited 21m coins philosophy 
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:16:42
Things can change 
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:27:52
You. Are. Actually. So. Stupid. Here’s a checklist for you, seeing as you KNOW that bitcoin will drop further in price! 1: Sell the remaining bitcoin that you have. 2: Open a short position. Time to put your money where your mouth is, right?
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:50:53
This ^
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:10:21
That’s not how things work mate! :-) 
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:35:27
We can’t know for sure man :-) I think promises of sky high ATH’s got us into this situation in the first place!
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:31:47
What’s the mining of life?

@_date: 2018-02-04 12:17:42
You. Are. So. Dumb.
