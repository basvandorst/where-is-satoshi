of course I could be wrong... That is why I was (shamelessly) plugging Coinarch.com previously. Take a view and you can monetise it.

Like I said, use coinarch.com and short it. Keen to get your feedback and comments on the site! Good luck with your view.

Agree with DuckTech. What incentive would there be for the buyer to suddenly dump? No buyer would dump. They know liquidity is not fantastic, so even if they bought at a decent discount to the current price any trader worth their salt would not be betting on exiting over next little while. So surely the game for them is a long term one...

We have just started coinarch.com - a bitcoin trading platform. Anyway I just like to get that in there... Sorry in response to the actual post. DigitialBTC listed this year on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). I think (not know) it is the first IPO of a bitcoin business listed... Maybe ASX is not a major exchange :)

I would have thought it depends? Do you want use bitcoin buy things? Or bitcoin vs [some other asset] exposure. I am involved with a company called Coinarch. Coinarch is a bitcoin trading platform that allows you to go long or short (as well as take leverage) vs USD. Check it out at coinarch.com
Keen to get feedback and comments. Thanks

There is a similar thread. Definitely good to get people's thoughts. And thoughts on Coinarch, which allows you to go long or short BTC vs USD. You can leverage it as well. So interested to see people put there money where there mouth is. Happily if you get it wrong, you can only lose the amount you wish (i.e. stop it out) and if you get it right you can leverage it up a fair bit! So good to get peoples thoughts.

I don't have a view on the price, though am involved with a company called Coinarch. Coinarch allows you to take a view on the price and profit from it. And you can leverage it if you want. It has just been released so would be great to get peoples thoughts. And for people to put there money where there mouth is ;) See coinarch.com

NYSE is probably a different level to every stock exchange... Though the comment was major exchange. ASX is top 10 (most of the time, admittedly 10 times smaller than NYSE). Though arguably major enough... and certainly regulated enough... Anyway don't want to get into semantics... Just worth mentioning DigitalBTC and give ourselves a shameless plug at the same time :)
