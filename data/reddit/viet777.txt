@_date: 2018-01-29 22:27:07
And this is how a meme is born
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:54:14
You can get 1 bitcoin with that. Open an account on coinbase and buy it.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:18:48
You can identify as 16.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:28:10
Can’t wait for this to open up! This is huge!!!
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:57:16
That’s $225,000,000 in bitcoins. Wth. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:40:59
Transfer the funds to GDAX then send it out. They pay the fee for you.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:58:49
Are you a billionaire or something 
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:20:32
That’s socialism bruh
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:13:56
I asked Santa for bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:45:01
Coinbase pays for my fees so it’s all good 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:03:50
GDAX sorry
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:13:26
Just a question about GDAX withdrawal fees.
I heard that GDAX pays for networks fees and such. How can they afford to pay for this given how much fees have risen of the last month or so? One could literally buy bitcoin from coinbase, transfer it to GDAX and send out the bitcoin free of charge. How can they afford that as a business?

Damn thats crazy dude, I’d move it to a cold storage

@_date: 2017-12-26 19:51:54
Kinda expected, Christmas shoppers jumping ship
@_date: 2018-06-10 12:58:58
Bitcoin is on a down hill romp and there is no sign of correction anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-06-15 23:59:08
Price rose because of the exposure it got and how much people were taking about it
@_date: 2018-06-10 13:46:54
@_date: 2019-02-16 02:52:34

@_date: 2019-02-16 02:48:12
BitPay has been reliable for me
@_date: 2019-02-16 04:00:49

@_date: 2018-02-10 11:53:13
If you believe in a product than you invest in it with a projected return. In a casino, the house always wins.

I need to hire this guy to be my crypto adviser
