Is there any minimum figures for altcoins to be withdraw-ed on binance? Bitfinex held hostage to my 10 altcoins and wont let me transfer it only if my altcoins would reached 70, fcking shit I need to spend more just to withdraw my alt coins. I hope binance has a better offering for transfer.

Paying will depend on you or on the merchant.
If the merchant support bitcoin payments directly then you just need to scan his QR code to send payments.
Or you could just cash out and buy the things with fiat.

Sad to say but a disk which is always in use every day has a zero to impossible way to retrieving files from years ago.
To put that in perspective lets say you have wallet.dat file on your desktop last 2011. This wallet.dat is stored on data blocks on an HDD even it is deleted it can be retrieved given that the block where it was staying was not overwritten by another file lets say reddit.exe.

Bitcoin started the revolution and all altcoins is just inspired by Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is still in its infancy and all crypto so before investing you should tell yourself that your initial investment or any money you invest in any cryto could evaporate in any moment or any seconds. This is a high risk and high reward system if you can tolerate this risk then consider investing and read first the benefits of cryptos and not just bitcoin alone. No central banks, No government control, No middle man do i need to say more?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:33:47
No dip brother this week has been all correction.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:03:46
Different exchanges offer different exchange rate.
For example a 1BTC on GDAX is @ $15000 while on Bread it is $14500.
There are no central exchange rate that is followed by everyone.

I rest my case. This is the best possible explanation that I can give without going on into technical.
Believe whatever what you want to believe in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:46:55
I will give you a basic example:
Lets imagine a country where the government give its people $1 to survive and buy a doughnut everyday.
Population: 1000,
Dollars allocated / person: $1 / $1 * 1000 = $1000,
Donuts created everyday: 1000
So we can say that the government is only giving an equal amount of dollars for each person for a donut which cost $1. Its goes for years and years not until the new government decided to increase the dollar allocation per people to $2 but the donuts that will be created will still the same.
Population: 1000,
Dollars allocated / person: $2 / $2 * 1000 = $2000, 
Donuts created everyday: 1000
With this there is already a deficit of a thousand donuts since this people has now more buying power than before but the food supply remains unchanged, someone could buy twice the donuts. If 500 people buy twice the donuts then the remaining 500 people will starve if this happens then the price of donuts could rise and the imaginary country would go haywire.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:49:21
I've been re-reading this shit for almost like a thousand on this subs and the price just keep ballooning. 
Bitcoin is not free of manipulations but its tamper proof no one owns the supply or create a coin out of thin air.

For your information that there is no centralize price that is used by all exchanges. Its their prerogative on how much they would sell and buy.
You don't need to worry just calculate all your total bitcoin and multiply it to your desired exchange rate.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:28:25
Basically this is the plan. Its up to an owner if he hodl or sells.

Bitcoin economy is vulnerable to manipulations by the top 1% but no one can manipulate the supply or create coins out of thin air compare to federal reserve.
So a bubble is really an absurd idea.

This depends on the wallet feature. Most wallet has a fixed transaction fee choices where you will choose (low, medium,high priority) if you can set manually then you can follow the fees table but if there is no option try to check from time to time the fees on your wallet since it will change from time to time.

There is no problem if you are building things on credit, you just need to make sure that you can actually pay the things when its due.
If you have 
Savings: $1000
Credit: $2000
And you invested $2000 worth of credit into bitcoin then you are purely speculative and it could also be one of the reason of a crash since this people will totally cash out when it dips and when their credit is due.
If we follow the above example of savings and credit, its best to invest $500 - $600 than maxing it to $2000.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:13:18
Yes there is nothing to be worried about and keep in mind that some exchanges also offers a wide gap on buying and selling.
Buy $15000
Sell $14000
So keep that in mind as well.
Happy hodling
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:40:06
Just keep on checking what transfer method or medium are you using? dont transfer coins during the peak situations where it could cost $20-$40. Wait for it to offpeak.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:20:04
Basically what you are thinking will destroy an economy of a country alone. If they print more money then they will just create a hyperinflation (Look at hyperinflation in Zimbabwe). They have a bill that is trillion in zimbabwe dollar but only equal to $2-$3. 
In other words printing more money wont solve it as it will definitely destroy a country alive. If everyone has a $1million USD then prices would definitely rise since there is many supply than the demand.
It could be a different story if a government will switch from gold standard to BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:32:09
This will never happen this not how the economy works.
Even if all the central banks / federal reserve in the world cooperate on this agenda they can magically prints more money but they cant and never magically or make out of thin air the goods(foods, fuel, basic commodities) and services of a country.

If they build their investment on credit that they couldn't pay then they will just put their self into a deeper grave once BTC dip during their credit payment.
Never build your investment on credit is the best financial route when investing in Bitcoin since its very volatile.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:02:44
Because there is no centralize rate that is being followed.
Lets put it to this.

Yes better if that way and one advise be sure that your wallet is safe if you are hodling and investing a lot be sure to invest into a hardware wallet or if you are using a hot wallet be sure to safeguard and hide the recovery words and never ever do the hodling into an exchange site.
If you have any questions or help them feel free to ask.

Its never a good laugh. Remember that he wants to invest more into bitcoin with credit no one would assume the price of bitcoin as of today it could go up it could go down or $0. I believe that he made the right choice instead putting himself to debt he still has handful of coins to spend / invest.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:58:05
Do a research before pouring any money this isnt a game of winners all the time.
And take note only spend money your are willing to lose and once you invested it into bitcoin assume that it is already gone so you wont be tempted to just pour in money.
I saw your post into diversify it and invest the money into your self by finishing your studies instead of burning it out , it is much fullfilling seing yourself with a degree than with 1 BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:03:38
Yes this is true. If many users will HODL it will just lessen the bitcoins in circulation making the bitcoin economy stagnant at some point.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:01:58
I wont until the next halving.
I dont care the price of it single day it could go up and down or sideways. But will keep on hodling.

Bread has no control on the wallet itself unlike exchanges (which has direct control of your private keys), bread users control their private keys so in case a fork comes in users are still safe.
Its open source, directly connected to the bitcoin network, you are the only one who has control of your private keys. Then what more can you ask for? Bread is suitable if you currently doesn't have any funds to spare for a hardware wallet or you can go the paper wallet route if you are that paranoid.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:59:40
Tell him that its the risk you are willing to lose.
I am not afraid on losing my hodling even if BTC went nose dive.
You could also argue that it is same as investing in stock market your money there could also evaporate within seconds.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:11:16
Basically it is  normal to regret those things its human nature.
Those early adopters and spenders really build the foundation on where bitcoin is today.
No one predicted that this thing would take off after all this years. So if I am someone who paid BTC 10000 for a pizza in the 2009-2010 then I would definitely regret it in my lifetime.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:05:54
No they are just schemers and manipulators.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:36:44
There are lot to consider on Satoshi real identity is.
I believe some forensics intense tracking doesnt exist in 2009-2010 and it would be very hard to track him down with tools that day.
He could use a VPN connect that thru 1-2 proxy chains - TOR.
Its multiple hops that is why tracking him would be difficult and I assume the reason of his departure from the community in 2010 its because he knew that when BTC gain some traction or become mainstream then tracking him would be easy. And also as said by fellow redditor that ISPs or VPN service  may not hold anymore of that record since its already 7-8 years.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:49:23
Maybe an attack again since this small transactions are pooling into the block chain the transaction fee goes high and the transaction time is nearly doubled.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:17:47
Its fine its better for you to experience it since there would be attacks like those in the near future. A thing will lose its value or it will dip if many people are trading in or cashing out at the same time causing panic and unstability. So be better than them this aint for the faint of hearts. Just hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:37:15
Bitcoin is built with security, anonymity, efficiency, economics consideration in mind.
The rise of the price of bitcoin is merely due to the rarity of the coin since there is no entity who controls the supply. Coin is generated via cryptography / mining which is exhausting computer hardware and electricity.
There is also a safeguard to control inflation on bitcoin it halves every 4 years if we can mine 25 bitcoin today it would be 12.5 the next four years and so on until we reach the limit of 21 million coins.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:19:14

@_date: 2017-11-15 23:41:47
How could bitcoin be a bubble?
Try to research about bitcoin first to know what you are investing before you pour in your money.
This is a volatile market that would give you heartaches from time to time but investing long term would be worth it. I cant and never consider bitcoin as a bubble since there is no central authority that controls or manipulate the coins and there is halving every 4 years (correct me if im wrong) to battle inflation.
The only risk is volatility and government regulations or sanctions.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:52:23
What? This could be random bots that are pooling transactions in the block chain causing panic, higher transaction fee and longer transaction time. 
And OP gained coins that is unknown to him.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:53:58
You cant earn btc not unless you mine it using specialized hardware.
Yes hodl = hold 
Hodling means no matter what happens you stay calm and keep the faith on BTC. I suggest that dont look at the price from time to time or you will felt being stab everytime but endure it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:50:17
Why would you panic? If you traded then you are also one of the factors of the dip. Best way is to ignore that and keep on hodling.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:28:23
What is the current status of the drive? It is used for sometime before you reformatted it? 
Recovery are very slim if the drive was used after reformatting as that path / blocks in the hard drive is already overwritten. 
I suggest try to use recovery softwares first and run a deep scan. You could try recuva and all sorts of known and trusted recovery software before jumping into hardware recovery solution.
And also there is a risk if you will ever consider handing it to a recovery facility, lets say that they succesfully recovered it, it might spark interest into your wallet.
Best of luck mate I hope that you find those coins.
