There will be increasing opportunities for non-accredited investors to buy equity in companies like Dwolla, but for now your assumption is correct.

Also, Quora is a good place for questions like this, Dwolla might even have someone on staff that checks Quora answers and could personally respond or reach out to you.

If you're asking here it's very likely you don't meet the minimum qualifications to invest in a company like Dwolla. They are not public so you would need to be an accredited investor ($1 Million liquid other than your primary residence) to invest, and because of the interest they have generated you would probably have to provide somewhat of a benefit to them as an investor. If that's the case I would highly recommend reaching out to them, but if you were thinking of investing something in the tens of thousands or less it's probably not an option.

Good to know that no one has any idea what's going on.

You can make any exponential growth graph look like any other exponential growth graph assuming you can control the values and scale of the x and y axis. Those graphs also look exactly like some graphs of reddit's traffic growth.

Yes, I have heard that, but as i'm sure you're aware, Dwolla has no incentive to give him equity unless he can provide a noticeable benefit.

yes, but reddit only allows css modification of subreddits
