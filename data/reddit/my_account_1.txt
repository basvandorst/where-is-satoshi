Toll roads, private schools, fire insurance, health insurance.
Not sure what "public assistance" is.

The Euro is only 23 years old. Bitcoin is 17 years younger at 6 years old, or 23% as old as the Euro.

I think a potential mitigation against this would be to develop free and open-source "wallet server" software. These would enable people to have the convenience of accessing their funds anywhere there's Internet, while still not centralizing everything. They could install it just as easily (hopefully easier) as a web or FTP server on their home PC, and access their wallet remotely via a mobile app.

They do.

Give it a try. It's free and risk-free to implement, so it can't do any harm to have a go!

So... maybe I'm missing something here, but surely the solution to this is to get the merchant to broadcast the tx? This could be over NFC or with the use of a second QR code that the merchant scans from the customer's phone.
If the merchant has the tx, all they need is their own, well-connected bitcoin node to broadcast the tx asap. I guess higher fees would help if they're willing to pay them.
Why would the customer need confirmation of the transaction? It doesn't matter to him, it's the merchant that needs the blockchain to confirm quickly, so it makes sense for the merchant to be the one to broadcast. Then the customer doesn't even need an internet connection.

I support this idea. People who are just getting in to Bitcoin don't want to hear that they "can't afford a whole one".
Plus it looks wierd all the prices online being 0.0xx BTC.
My wallet already displays in mBTC, and IMO it's a much better standard.

Very nice! I like the idea.
Just wondering, though, whether this could be implemented as a User Script (i.e. Greasemonkey) rather than a full-blown browser extension? That would seem simpler to me.

Guys, I know he's a butter, but upvoted because this is actually funny.
Stop being so sensitive!

I can't get lighthouse to work on my Trisquel 7 installation. I've downloaded and installed the deb, but it just crashes on startup. :(

You could find charities that accept BTC donations. There are quite a few now...

Very nice!
Does the site use some variation of Mediagoblin? I noticed you use video.js

If I save someone from being hit by a bus, does that mean I can go and shoot someone else in the face?
