plus the whole volatility is turning it to shit ... cant be used a means of payment when its value swings overnight by 25% .... a reseller profit margin even on grey markets for digi products often doesnt surpass 25% ... so why risk your trading capital / or invest it in something else than you are trading with .... sorry but speculations fucked up the BTC/altcoins whole purpose of being a method of payment ...

digital software licenses and similar digital property items are traded massively on the grey market for BTC and pretty much any other major alt.  ... especially since such trades occur mostly between a 1st world country member and some 3rd world involved party where they acquire cheaper licenses (india, iran, pakistan, and such people don't even have proper access to global banking or paypal ...plus to get away from the tax burden they only accept BTC/alts as means of payments.... its a bitch and a pain in the ass though and becomes more and more impossible to use due to higher transaction fees :/ but used to be a good daily trade thingy.

i dont think i misunderstood it so much ...the free blowjobs were obviously an exaggeration of how far the miners will go to "catch" a customer ...
given the sharp decline in BTC price i belive miners are temporarily willing to accept anything which is above 0.01$ ...when the price was up the miners were waiting for higher trans fees to be paid in order to process... now they would process almost for free just to keep the network alive... imho reeks of desperate miners/pools

yup but because holding money in BTC has amounted to a loss of Percentage change in the last two weeks
 $ -1,275.66 (-13.84%)
so i imagine soon the miners/nodes/pools whatever they are called will be soon offering free blowjobs ...just to try and stop this plunge into the abyss
if bitcoin were to raise again ..we would probably see again fees in the order of 3-9$ / 10-10000$ transfered ...

The thing we should point out here..is that you can send 10 000 or even 100 000 or more with BTC without triggering the AML alarm any bank has ..
otherwise i'd feel safer doing a f'n'f paypal which are priced at 1% i think ? similar like bank wires

ok and any idea to find out how much it influences it ?
i mean we know how much exchanges trade in volume (at least from what is shown on coinmarketcap etc ... but do we have some similar insight into the BTC FOREX market ? is it same size as BTC exchange market ? is it 20% of the BTC exchange market volume ? or other value ?
