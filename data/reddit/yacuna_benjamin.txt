Feel free to [try]( it out :D

Glad to see that you used our blocksize graphic for this :) Happy to support the cryptocurrency community
@_date: 2015-06-07 07:07:13
Mostly because we do not use Bots to artificially boost our volume, like some renowned other exchanges do. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 11:50:58
Translation correct :)
@_date: 2014-11-26 13:26:10
Sorry. Next time I don't put my eye make-up on before taking a picture :)
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:02:31
Try Yacuna ;)

It is relatively unknown in the UK since it has its origin in Germany. Basically you use your usual bank account to initiate a wire transfer, but the Sofort bank instantly deposits your fund into our account. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 13:24:58
Yeah but as far as I found it no one reported on it in detail. So I did.

Price seems to hover around a bit. Price is bound to come back, Bitcoin adaption is stronger than ever. This is just a massive sell-of probably from the Bitstamp hack.
If you want to take advantage of the low price start [here]( 100€ worth of Bitcoins without verification. Thats more than half a Coin now.

Hey burstup,  
sorry that you had to wait that long. We will improve our procedures to ensure the timely transfer of coins in the future.  
Kind Regards and thank you for using our services

Dear moolikeacow,  




Yacuna is a company that is as regulated as you can get a cryptocurrency company. While we are not standing in the FCA register, all fiat-money is held with PayCo. Also we enforce all rules and regulations that apply to E-money institutes and are in close contact with the authorities and law enforcement. That we are not mentioned in the FCA register is solely due to the lack of a legal basis for the FCA to do so.  
So if you define regulated as "can be found in an register" we are not regulated. If you define it as "complies with the rules, stands in direct contact with the authorities and holds fiat money with a licensed E-money institute" we are fully regulated.  
And we confidently call ourselves so :)


That's true. But its also a tactic of dodgy companies to open up fully unregulated bitcoin exchanges ;)
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:57:25
Luckily we do not have to pay thousands of bitcoins to bankers to crash our currency :)

If you are looking for an exchange that already implemented your three suggestions you may want to visit [Yacuna.com](  
We are at any time able to prove our holdings in cold storage. We have implemented multi-signature wallets for Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin.  
We are regulated with the British FCA and are currently working with our payment provider on how to best audit a cryptocurrency exchange. We are currently planning to have a full audit in the next months and will publish the results on our [blog](

Hello moolikeacow,
thanks for the great questions! I am happy to answer.  


Like I said, the FCA does currently not deal with cryptocurrency businesses directly.  




Yes. That is the whole idea. Since the FCA does not deal with cryptocurrency businesses but only with E-Money institutes, we partnered up with PayCo. They hold fiat currency that is deposited at Yacuna and enforce FCA regulations. This seems to work very well, since Yacuna has not lost a single EUR, GBP or BTC to date. You may want to ask BitStamp how their regulation model looks like. 






I think it gives no impression at all. In the time of the Internet and the Blockchain I do not think it is necessary to rent out expensive office space (in London!) to start a company. We stand 100% behind our product and you can find the profiles of our directors [here]( and on LinkedIn. We can look into providing the address of our CEO if that is widely requested, but currently I do not have the impression that this would add any layer of trust that is not already provided by our regulative basis and openness.

If Bitcoin goes beyond $1000 [we]( will give out free cheeseburgers at a McDonalds in London ;)

To my knowledge there are no public statements of the FCA towards cryptocurrency businesses. And I can't relay our correspondence with them to the public. But you may inquire at the FCA itself or at PayCo or both about our regulative standing. In my experience both entities answer pretty fast.  
This may not be a fully satisfying answer, but the best I can give you. Our regulative situation is as I described it and afaik the best regulation and official oversight you can get from any EU cryptocurrency exchange. I do not see, how this is "smoke and mirrors". 
@_date: 2015-01-05 12:37:27
Hey moolikeacow,  
indeed we are FCA regulated *through* our payment provider PayCo. The FCA does not regulate cryptocurrency businesses directly but only E-money businesses. In order to fulfill their legal requirements PayCo enforces all rules and regulations on us, Yacuna.  
The FCA seems to have trouble with its E-Money Firm register. If you look [here]( you see that they only list one E-Money institute, when there have been hundreds last month. Also if you look for the registration number of some big names like neteller or skrill you won't find them via the search.    
**EDIT**: Works again!
We are operating mainly from London, but since we are an international team we have no need for a costly office building. Instead we are mainly talking via Skype which is much more cost-efficient for a Start-Up like us. The address given is our legal address where we receive and send any documents from.

I met him at a Bundesbank forum about Bitcoin. They rightfully complained about the prohibitive regulation in Germany but otherwise seemed pretty fine. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 07:30:34
That sounds pretty sci-fi. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 08:45:47
We are also publishing on legal issues surrounding Bitcoin. For example [Europe]( [Germany]( and [Switzerland](

This provides a very safe, easy and fast payment method for you to buy Bitcoin lightning fast at [Yacuna Direct](
@_date: 2015-03-31 07:28:45
Maybe we see implementation of Bitcoin in Minecraft. Buy a new skin for 0.001 BTC!
@_date: 2015-03-31 07:30:03
Go ahead and give it a try! I would like to see something like this.
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:23:40
That sucks. It is not only bad news for affected users but for the bitcoin community as a whole. This will make people say "See, Bitcoin is not safe!" again. 
In most cases it is better to store large amount of BTC in a Trezor or a paper wallet that only you have access to. If you need to deposit them at an exchange for trading please make sure that they at least use [multi-signature]( for their customer wallets.
@_date: 2015-02-03 09:14:20
If we try this in the Bitcoin market, these very same people would shout "Currency of criminals" and call for bans and punishment.
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:29:42
That's about right! We at [Yacuna]( are using multi-signature for every transaction involving the blockchain. You can read about it [here]( 
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:36:33
If it was an inside job or not remains to be seen. But not applying multi-signature to your cold-wallets is negligent as hell. Author is right when he warns about using exchanges where you know the people and the address. Bonus points if they are registered in the company register. So if you are in Europe you should either use Bitstamp or us at [Yacuna]( We can not only be found easily in real life we also use [multi-signature]( for our customers funds. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 09:40:10
Problem is, if you exchange your coins for fiat you cannot just withdraw the money instantly. It will take a day or two before you notice that something is off. So you have to trust the exchange you use to a certain extent anyway.  
Otherwise, yeah, always withdraw your coins if you do not intend to trade them in the next 15 minutes.
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:29:40
Hey frankid thanks for this list! I make sure to tweet it to our followers. If you need to store some BTC at an exchange for trading purposes you should also prefer those who prefer [multi-signature]( wallets like we do.
