I didnt know this lol. Anyway its still better to be sure than to have to deal with BTC confirmations in a country i cannot speak the language
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:50:28
So it feels slow? Dissapointment? can't read the cat's feelings well lol
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:16:50
Planning on selling?
 It is reaching my 9K Half investment but decided to just average it out with my long term initial investment so still good
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:56:13
You know usually its during the crash you should have bought not after it recovers.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:18:27
Priority fees where $15 and it was a small percentage of the purchase. Also don't want to have any issue with communication if there are issues with payment
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:23:25
I use coinmama in case you don't want to support coinbase and its practices
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:53:18
Yahoo email still has my 2005 email as well. It didnt even delete any of my spam as well lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:36:52
Not implimenting segwit or even just batched transactions(meaning increasing fees for all ), insider information with BCH.

For a chance to prove that everything i learned is not useless. I went all in disregarding my parents advice about "bitcoin is nothing" investments are ebtter in other markets "like restaurants" and such
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:46:20
Just want to point out that nearly EVERY one that lets you buy bitcoin needs those creds.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:05:04
Yeah sadly the tech needed didnt explode as much as the number of people adding new BTC accounts
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:02:20
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:15:12
As much as i do use them. You still have to give reddit some income
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:23:58
Hey we all start small, even just a bit  will still net you gains
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:28:17
WAIT dont sell yet. Wait a bit to get your Super bitcoin and BCH as well then sell.
Or you know just HODL and just sell bit by bit when you need to
EDIT: whats the shortcut for Superbitcoin??? and forgot what other forks happened before
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:05:44
That is the current issue with fees. Which is why people have been clamoring segwit and batch releases from exchanges to lessen the load on the pool.
Thats why other crypto right now is being used as "currency" while btc is right now "store of value"(unless you are buying large stuff where the fee is just right).
hopefully LN comes faster
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:03:10
Suicide is a bit of a stretch but it is a certain difficulty that needs to be addressed quickly.
Thats why Alt coins are rising due to to delay LN\Segwit adoption brings.
I am personally finding ways to use other coins as well
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:29:58
That would mean a hard/soft fork
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:44:16
Congrats to the last holder\hodler!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:15:18
Why did you release before confirmation?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:49:14
Around $60 a month for the 3 rigs 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:05:56
I have been active lately since i planned to buy or complete 1 BTC. due to sudden price increase i am only able to get .85. I put my whole retirement benefit in hopefully i am still able to complete it
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:06:07
I used coinmama via credit card
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:13:57
I personally have an old phone that is there for Mycellium backup and Authy backup for 2FA
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:16:50
but will you actually buy if it falls that low? and what if it continues to do so
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:21:38
Well for purchasing alone i was successful using coinmama. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:37:03
localbitcoin for PP
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:26:50
Its an exchange that has a wallet
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:42:13
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:29:29
I used Credit to buy but those are already paid as soon as it entered my balance
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:06:39
Due to fees being high 2 grand 1 drop is i think ok. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:22:24
Dota 2 is a game by Valce which has quite an active trading scene which sometimes trade BTC
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:40:20
Still buying is ok. AS much as people say and SHOULD follow dont invest you are willing to lose. I used my last remaining money in my retirement package on it JUST before the spike to 19K and doubled my savings in 2 weeks. 
And still i do not have 1 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:23:35
Others keep it on NH wallet. I do most of the time but thankfully i withrew all of it 2 weeks ago and lost only $80. I can live with that loss
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:19:23
Aw sadly you got baited by it. You should have followed the rules and just release after confirmation
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:20:44
Well most of the poeple who mine are not actually mining in BTC but other Crypto like Etherium they are just paid in BTC
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:04:04
Not the subbreddit for this so it will probably reported.
LTC and going to buy some newer coins. even a bit will do.
LTC and BCH i do have
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:46:51
Hehe thanks, just happy that it stabilized after that huge correction and it did. 
Still i would ad ise you to spend accordingly
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:36:57
Yeah and then renovate your whole front yard with a garden of tulips
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:56:31
A fork coming later or in a bit. It should pop up once the block has been reached
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:35:50
Title alone is enough not to make me read it
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:08:19
i just hope we have a spirit of giving like those in BCH. As much as ridicule they receive here they do help and tip quite often
(I know it is a posssibilty that its just an allure but I think some actually do give wholeheartedly)
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:38:04
I am also waiting news for LN. All i read and see are that its coming but i need and want a date. Right now BCH is staying put but they know that every delay they can add more to their cause
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:25:37
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:34:41
Yeah and right now i am just here contemplating on how blessed i was that i moved it to mycellium.  0.16 BTC several months of mining compared to less than 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:19
Went to 19K from 10K in about 24-48 hours. then corrected to 13.8K in 3 days just 2 weeks ago
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:04:30
Anyone actually bought this? how was the process?
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:16:48
Any wallet that supports segwit
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:39:20
He was answering because you can easily search.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:27:02
Hmm i would also like to know. I found an old 88 kb wallet.dat as well but no space yet for bitcoin core
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:40:58
Copy your most important files and reformat it to be safe.
I had a backdoor once happen to me and lost $70. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:54:27
Yes, I started mining for BTC since early this year. 80 cents a day, small but enough for my gaming habits but havent really used it for STeam but still mined daily.
It grew and it grew. In total before i actually paid for BTC i managed to get 0.425 BTC which is now worth quite a bit.
And it started with just 80 cents a day(Note i managed to buy another GPU with that money in the first half and also mined with that and invested some more)
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:17:19
How about BCH\XMR or other alt coins? 
Thats why people who said you can buy a fraction is right BUT i would not say that to anyone who wants to buy small doses. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:21:52
Or just eating their left nut
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:18:34
How many Newtons is safe to buy from LBC?
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:52:34
Is this Global?
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:17:11
I used coinmama no problems. And do not use coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:34:32
Yes but i tried that this year and i can't reach 1 BTC anymore. If BTC grows at this rate next year I dont know if you can as well
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:39:58
Its not sitting around. its being kept open and charged but not used with SIM
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:58:02
Congrats! Hopefully i can complete 1 Bitcoin as well. I really want to say 1 whole bitcoin to start a conversation since saying to people asking about it that i have a fourth of a bitcoin starts the conversation in the wrong foot. Making it look like its hard to get 1 Bitcoin and tell them to get  a bit of it as well
@_date: 2016-12-21 23:43:08
Was about to post this as well.
This is the TLDR of what bitcoin is.
Finally someone explained how this works in its simplest terms
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:59:02
i use coin mama when it was 8K-9K a few days ago the fees were high but hey look bitcoin is now 10K. I earned back the fees lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:58:42
Just bought 0.05 BTC probably my last for now. I dont know if i am able to complete 1 BTC lol need .15 more. cheers
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:09:16
coinmama for me
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:39:36
I personally think that the fact it survived a Bubble and crashed and still risen back to its current trend ahows it can survive. 
I still think there "might" be a crash looming but then majority of people already has a mindset like "the last time it crashed it still grew, so once it crashes i'll buy" I recently bought during some ATH recently and i still gained money
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:56:42
I used coinmama past few weeks nad just a few hours ago
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:33:48
but what if the dip never came?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:17:08
I used 2 credit cards 1 had issues while the other one had none. Used the one without issues twice and was able to buy at 8K and 9K before the hit to 10K. .2 BTC at a time
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:45:14
NP if only i knew how to pay months before by credit how easy it was lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:40:22
Wait didnt I just buy at an ATH a few hours ago at 10K?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:35:11
15-30 minutes from what i recall. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:08:03
US thanksgiving was actually a secret meeting between HODLERS and their relatives to buy more BTC
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:11:33
dont you mean NOW?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:09:33
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:06:56
When i was checking how to buy bitcoin via credit i wasnt sure what was trusted or not. and i waited a long time before buying
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:54:15
I used localbitcoins. some accept PP 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:07:31
try localbitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:10:51
try localbitcoin 
@_date: 2019-04-07 11:41:04
This was the only way i showed my father that bitcoin is a currency. Bought him a Surface pro last year. I am from PH so this was the closest country where i can show him.
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:40:54
I lost it with the MGS scene
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:18:33
BIC Camera accepts bitcoin as payment and was hassle free.
@_date: 2018-02-16 04:55:58
I thought it was already dead?
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:34:58
You can still run games. 
CPU limited games are ok, some light 3d games are also ok but you will experience some FPS drops or non-optimal frame rates.
Source me Steam gamer and i do test playing some games with Dagger running. 
He is possibly also using his CPU to mine (which is not really worth it unless you have free electricity)

@_date: 2018-02-15 22:38:33
They(or some) probably just ment some of their BTC and not all. You would still need to use it for it to grow further.
FIAT will not go away that quickly and possibly not in this current generation
