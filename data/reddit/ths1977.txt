In the case that some may not know how the street works, Goldman Sachs et al buy and get into companies at pre ipo levels and then sell and make a market to institutional investors whom then resell to retail investors.
IMHO, if in fact "the street" is just now getting into bitcoin this means that an additional 50 - 100x + is headed our way.
My prediction: we wont ever see bitcoin under $1000.00 again.... Ever.

He has to say this, why? Because it is too small.
Buffet has said numerous times that he wishes he had less money so that he could buy smaller companies.
With bitcoin currently at $8B market cap, his hint that he even likes bitcoin as a technology or currency could potentially ruin our need for steady, slow growth.
In addition he almost never buys tech, ever, his mantra is, if he doesnt understand it he wont buy it.

Nothing in this article says that they don't like it, as a matter of fact they are seeking specific guidance from regulators such as the IRS et al, so that they can move forward legitimately with serving business customers in the bitcoin space. One might also presume that this would clarify things with the buying and selling of bitcoin for users as well.

Personally I do not trade bitcoin, just buy and hold, but your last thought got me thinking about taxes and traders that are currently doing this manually.
I am a developer, windows/web, how big of a market do you think something like this has or will have?
Could you expound on what it is that you would need in a software package or website to do this for you and importantly would you pay for this kind of service? If so how much?
What parts of this process cause the most friction?
The entire process, gathering all of the trades or something else?
What type of system are you currently using? Excel, OSX Numbers, LibreOffice, pen and paper, something else?
Would you rather have a desktop app or web, what would you consider an MVP (minimum viable product) product for market viability testing purposes?
Are their other issues as a trader or bitcoin user in general that cause you friction in the bitcoin space that you are hopping to see come onto the market, i.e. when you say to yourself; "I wish this was easier" or "their must be a better way" or "somebody needs to invent this" type of thoughts.

So my eBay index is about how many listings show up on ebay for the keyword bitcoin -contract, last month the amount of results was about 3000, today I checked it and it is above 11,000 listings.
To me this is an indication of at least increased awareness of bitcoin, furthermore it may indicate sellers demand on ebay to accept bitcoin rather than paypal. If we extrapolate this out and ebay uk's decision to allow virtual currency sales, it may only be a matter of time before we see bitcoins acceptance by ebay us.

download the FXCM app (desktop/iphone/android/tablet) and register for a free practice account, it may not have bitcoin but you will be able to play around with buying/shorting currencies. Try the usd/jpy or if you are really brave try the nzd/gbp pair (if memory serves this is one of the most volatile currency pairs their is).
edit: btc-e has a btc/usd feed that you can use in MT4 which is an app that you can download to practice with as well, but is for more advanced use cases and has the ability to modify your algo's for trading.

Good article but misleading tittle.

Here is the thing, most of us here are not accredited or institutional investors and never get a chance to be in on the ground floor of something as it approaches the beginning of its real "S" curve, the volatility that we are seeing is because there are allot of very weak hands out there going solely by instinct, hype and emotion.
Early stage startups (which is what this is) typically do not trade on exchanges that we get to play in and may or may not be as volatile, I would venture to say that they are not.
Bitcoin is still in its infancy, typical new technology takes anywhere from 5-10 years for mass adoption. I read somewhere recently that we are at 1% adoption rate, the tipping point of mass adoption is around 10%. Also consider that we are talking about a technology that is trying to disrupt the worlds economic systems... we have a long way to go and allot of roadblocks in the way before we see true adoption rates occur.
If you truly believe in the technology behind bitcoin and its abilities to massively disrupt 20% of the worlds GDP then stop worrying about getting in and out and trying to time the market, simply sit and hold or dollar cost average in.
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:36:57
Global GDP is ~71 Trillion / 21 Million ~= 3.4 Million per bitcoin.

When you start typing in the send to textbox in the send bitcoin page on coinbase they use an auto-complete javascript script to show similar addresses, where those come from I don't know. The first 3 characters where close enough to mine that I simply clicked it without confirming that it was my main address and then proceeded to click on the send bitcoin button.

I first heard about bitcoin either in 2011 or 2012 via Hacker News, it seemed interesting but I didn't learn more about it at that time.
Fast forward a year or so and I read a few more articles about bitcoin in January of this year(2013), after lurking and learning about bitcoin on bitcointalk.org for about 3 months, I jumped in and bought my first bitcoin for ~$50.
By trade I am a developer, so it scratched my nerd itch for all things tech, as a liberal it scratched my end the fed itch, as a non accredited investor it is a way for me to truly get in at the start of something big.
I would say that the two videos (linked below) was what helped me move to the true believer camp, bitcoin has the ability to change the way in which we conduct monetary transactions (and soooo much more) in the way that the internet changed the way in which we communicate.
Bitcoin to me is a protocol for global, decentralized, true democratic proof of ownership with a built in scripting language on top of which can be built unimaginable things in the coming years, this will change the world. It may not become the worlds reserve currency but it will facilitate massive change.

Imagine telling them they can cut 5% from their costs by using bitcoin, we are talking about adding 22.5 Billion straight to the bottom line, their stock would probably triple, and we are not even considering everything else that bitcoin can do out of the box that cuts costs.

If you are looking at bitcoin as just a digital currency and or a global payment system, then it seems that you need to do some more research...
Today bitcoin is only really being used as a p2p payment system this is just 1 think of many that can be done with it.
Bitcoin is a P2P, Decentralized, Global, Open Source, Proof of Ownership system.
The value that a transaction on the block-chain via colored coins or other mechanism can contain, can literally be anything, from stocks, bonds, smart property, a voting system, wills, deeds, proof of invention, a pdf, an mp3, as well as a system to allow for off-chain micro transactions, etc. etc. etc.
tl;dr; bitcoin is so much more then just money or a global payment system.
See the following videos for a tiny hint of what bitcoin can become.
"IF" bitcoin survives here are a couple of things that it could disrupt:
International Remittance: $500 Billion
E-commerce: $1+ Trillion
Micro-Transactions: ????
Store of Value (Gold): ~9 Trillion
"IF" bitcoin only takes 1% of each of the above we are talking about a market cap of: 100+ Billion, which is ~10x+ of where we are today.
Current rates via bitstamp as of this writing is $630.00.
At 1% market share of each of the above then bitcoin might be around $6300.00, not including any froth or speculation.
Personally I think bitcoin takes at least 25% of International Remittance, 10% of E-commerce and 10% of Store of Value and who knows how much micro-transactions will be worth in the coming years.
Also consider that bitcoin can automate about 20% of what wall street does today, what is that worth to people, countries and companies big and small?
In addition, there are 6+ billion people that are unbanked or underbanked, should some of them adopt bitcoin what will that be worth to the value of bitcoin?

Bitcoins ruling the world:
The Bitcoin system was implemented back in 2009. In the beginning, this crypto currency was used by hobbyists and mathematicians. Soon, they were joined by others – mostly ordinary people, but also cybercriminals and terrorists. They provide an almost anonymous and secure means of paying for goods. In the wake of the surveillance stories of 2013, there is perhaps little surprise that people are looking for alternative forms of payment. And it is gaining popularity – in November 2013, the mark surpassed the 400$ for one Bitcoin.
The methods used by cybercriminals to make money from their victims are not always subtle.  Apart from Bitcoins, which could potentially be stolen, ‘ransomware’ programmes became a popular means of making easy money – cybercriminals block access to a computer’s file system, or encrypt data files stored on the computer. Then they warn you that you must pay in order to recover your data.  This was the case with theCryptolocker Trojan. The cybercriminals give their victims only three days to pay up, accepting different forms of payment, including Bitcoin.

If bitcoin took over all monetary systems today each bitcoin would be worth $3,380,952.38 USD (Worlds GDP of 71 Trillion / 21 Million bitcoins)
However it may take some time for bitcoin to do this so lets say 100 years from now the worlds GDP goes up to $71 Quintillion USD divide that by 21MM bitcoins and we arrive at $3,380,952,400,000.00 == $3.3 Trillion USD per bitcoin.
I say that in 10 years time bitcoin will be 20% of world GDP and let's say that world GDP goes up to $100 Trillion USD == $20 Trillion / 21MM bitcoin == $952,380.95 USD per bitcoin.
*Note: Consider that there will never be 21MM bitcoins in existence do to satoshis stash that may or may not be lost forever as well as lost/stolen/forgotten wallets and forgotten passwords that will never be recovered.

     SAN JOSE (CN) - A company that sells "Bitcoin mining" equipment folded without delivering the equipment to its customers or refunding hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin advance payments, a purchaser claims in court.
     Howard Loo sued TerraHash Inc., Amir Khan and Tarandeep Gill, in Santa Clara County Court, alleging fraud, unjust enrichment and breach of contract. He claims the company took in more than $600,000 in a single week this summer - $97,000 of it from him, in Bitcoins - then never delivered the goods.
     Bitcoins are a virtual currency, which Loo describes as a digital form of gold, which can be transferred between people or merchants. Several businesses worldwide allow customers to pay for goods or services using Bitcoins. A single Bitcoin was selling for more than $1,000 this week.
     Bitcoins can be bought or sold through websites that exchange Bitcoins for traditional currencies. "(T)here is even a Bitcoin ATM in Vancouver, Canada, that will allow persons to buy and sell Bitcoins for cash," Loo says in the complaint.
     More than 12 million Bitcoins in circulation, and new Bitcoins are constantly being added, though there number will be capped at 21 million, according to the lawsuit.
     Bitcoin transactions are protected by cryptography. Specially programmed computers keep track of transfers and prevent people from copying and spending the same Bitcoin more than once time, which is known as double-spending. Operators of such computers are known as "miners" and are rewarded with transaction fees and newly minted Bitcoins, according to the lawsuit.
     TerraHash is a computer hardware company that claims to produce and sell application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) Bitcoin mining equipment using Avalon ASIC chips to sell to miners, Loo says.
     The company made several announcements on its website about mining equipment for sale. TerraHash took pre-orders for the equipment and said it would accept Bitcoins for payment, Loo says in the complaint. It offered a 5 percent discount for purchases with Bitcoins, which induced Loo to prepay TerraHash for the equipment, he says in the complaint.
     "On June 18, 19, and 20, 2013, defendants accepted online orders and prepayment from approximately 130 customers interested in the purchase of ASIC Bitcoin mining equipment," Loo says in the lawsuit. "TerraHash knew the material importance of delivery of the ASIC Bitcoin mining equipment quickly.
     "TerraHash received approximately $614,000 in prepayments from orders for ASIC Bitcoin mining equipment during this three day period."
     Loo says he ordered a Bitcoin mining device on June 18, for which he paid TerraHash 91.2542309 Bitcoins - now worth $97,050.
     Loo says that he was told he would receive the equipment by Aug. 15.
     But TerraHash did not have the ability to produce functional Bitcoin mining equipment, Loo says.
     "Indeed, on information and belief, TerraHash was a sham conceived by Amir Khan as a way of defrauding and converting large amounts of money and other valuable assets, including but not limited to Bitcoins, from potential customers of ASIC Bitcoin mining equipment, exploiting the high demand for that equipment," according to the complaint.
     The Aug. 15 delivery date came and went with no deliveries, Loo says. On Sept. 25, TerraHash announced on Bitcointalk.org "that 'a lot of customers' had asked for refunds; that TerraHash's bank had shut down its accounts; that it was 'impossible to continue our operation profitably,' and that defendants had therefore 'decided to dissolve the company,'" Loo says in the complaint.
     He claims he never received the equipment he paid for, nor a refund of the Bitcoins.
     "TerraHash and Khan, by inducing prepayments in the form of Bitcoins, sought to profit further by retaining the Bitcoins, thereby enjoying the anticipated surge in the market value of the Bitcoins," Loo claims.
     He wants his Bitcoins refunded and punitive damages for fraud, conversion, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, breach of contract and breach of faith.
     He is represented by Christopher D. Banys.

You can use two bitcoin payment gateways that I know of to make your life alot easier.
1) coinbase
2) bitpay
As for litecoin, I personally would not use it at this point but that is entirely up to you.
The benefits of using bitcoin for merchants are numerous but here are a few:
Very little transaction fee's, how much do you pay your bank or payment gateway or POS for the privilege of taking visa, mastercard, amex?
Irreversable transactions, users cannot reverse a charge on you and keep the merchandise. Once they pay that's it.
No possibility of civil forfeitures, no bank to limit or freeze your account because they don't like the way you are running your business or due to "risky" merchandise.

Nope, people with international remittance issues will (when it's easier to use) switch over to bitcoin en mass as they won't take into consideration the future value of a bitcoin, they just need to send some money to their family back home.
For instance a guy at work sends $50 to his aunt in Jamaica every week on payday, it costs him 18% ($9.00) via western union where he has to actually go to a western union ,fill out paper work and wait in line for sometimes up to an hour.
I told him about bitcoin and he was flabbergasted and immediately interested in how easy, cheap and fast it was for him to do so with bitcoin.
International remittance is a $500 Billion industry alone, should bitcoin take just 10% of that, it would push bitcoin to a $50+ Billion market cap, ~5x what we are at now.

I think the question you might be asking is, is 21 million bitcoins enough to run the global economy? If so then consider that each bitcoin is currently divisible into 100,000,000 satoshis, for a total of 2.1 quadrillion satoshis. Which for the time being as some have speculated is enough for global commerce.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:38:08
Technically right now it is 100,000,000, but if we need to we can increase the amount of zeros to the right of the decimal place to whatever is needed. The impedance now is that 32 bit systems are still mostly the norm.

Stop looking at bitcoin as just currency or even a payment system, even though that is what we are seeing used as today, that is not nearly what can be done with it.
Bitcoin is a P2P, Decentralized, Global, Open Source, Proof of Ownership system.
The value that a transaction on the block-chain via colored coins or other mechanism can literally be anything, from stocks, bonds, smart property, a voting system, wills, deeds, proof of invention, a pdf, an mp3, as well as a system to allow for off-chain micro transactions, etc. etc. etc.
tl;dr; bitcoin is so much more then just money or a global payment system.
See the following videos for a glimpse on what bitcoin can become.

You can buy them anywhere that you feel comfortable with, I personally use coinbase but as you may already know you should be doing your own due diligence. If you are purchasing them long term you basically have two options.
1) Cold storage, 
2) Physical coins, 
They are essentially the same thing but to me, as I already own other PM coins, they may appeal to as well, to me paper or USB storage feels less "real" somehow.

The Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) is a private, open-ended trust that is invested exclusively in bitcoin and derives its value solely from the price of bitcoin. It enables investors to gain exposure to the price movement of bitcoin without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping bitcoins.

You can use nLockTime to lock a transaction for a specified period of time OR a specific date and time.
Whereby you would send your bitcoins to yourself and use nLockTime to have it wait until that time or date has passed.
I don't know if you can undo an nLockTime so your coins would be frozen until the date or time that you chose came up.
For instance, send yourself 90% of your coins and lock them for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month or 1 year or whatever time you want, whenever they arrive back to your other address, send them back to their original address. This way you have 10% available for day to day transactions and 90% locked away.
Please do not take this as financial advice, I have never used this technique, but it is an idea for you.

When it's "fully consigned", as Honest Beef's explanation coyly puts it.
"We don't do PayPal, we don't do any of the credit cards. They charge too much, that eats into our profits, and we have to pass that on to the consumer. Direct payment and Bitcoin, they cost us nothing."
Yes, Bitcoin.
Honest Beef started accepting the digital currency earlier this year. Is anyone using it? "Plenty," Moloney said.

You are partially wrong in that the local banks that you and I use also lend out money that they do not physically have on hand, this is why most capital controls are in place to prevent runs on the banks.

Let me restate my question as I don't think I articulated it well enough.
What I am thinking of is to split a wallet (encrypted) in such a way that it is distributed throughout the cloud in bits and pieces so that the only way a wallet could be deleted (in whole) would be for the entire network to go down, much like bittorrent distributes files across the worlds computers, so would your wallet and thus be accessible no matter where in the world you are.

Everybody chip in please, I did.
@_date: 2013-09-29 19:45:33
&lt;strong&gt;Some points to consider before accusing us of scam:&lt;/strong&gt;
1. We stopped taking orders as soon as we had enough orders to account for the chips we ordered. If we were a scam, we would have continued taking orders and could have easily raised double the money we did.
2. We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on components, heat sinks, cases, boards, cables. For people saying that its "only a few resistors", look at the BOM provided by BkkCoins. It says components cost around $23 for a K16. And this does not include the heat sinks (~$14), boards etc. For each K16, the components including the heat sink, board, power cables, etc. cost us around $45. And we were prepared to assemble around 5,000 K16s (for 80,000 chips). There goes $250,000. Why 80,000 chips? We had ordered 40,000 of our own and had at least 4 other parties who were going to get their boards assembled from us. But guess what? Tired of the delays from Yifu, they all ended up getting a refund from Avalon.
3. We spent so much time and effort trying to source the really hard to get components. You can go read the Klondike thread where everyone is discussing the shortage of the PICs, the IR3895s, and others. But we have all the components, we even overpaid to get some of them. Show me a scammer who would do that.
4. For the components that even we could not get, we invested a lot of time to search for alternates. For example, the Power Inductor 38L361C was not available anywhere, so we instead bought SPM10040T-R36M170. But the latter was not pin compatible with the former. So we ended up changing the circuit board. I will publish the updated KiCad files. Would a scammer go through all this trouble? Anyone with half a brain can answer this.
If we were a scam, we would have disappeared on June 20th.
&lt;strong&gt;Why going out of business?&lt;/strong&gt;
I am really sick and tired of all the scam accusations. I appreciate all the negative criticism that the community does, resulting in catching scams in early stages in order to protect the newer members of the community. But baseless scam accusations from day one have taken their toll on our company. The FUD spread by a few members (along with the delay from Yifu) lead to a lot of refund requests. The result of which was that, if we continued with the project, we would have been left with inventory worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in our hands. And it would have been almost impossible to sell it at a price where we could even break even. Even if nobody asked for a refund, we would still have been left with about $125,000 worth of useless components (read point 4 above). But with about half of our customers asking for a refund, we would be stuck with another $350,000 worth of inventory that we couldn't have sold for more than $150,000, putting us under red for over $300,000. I am sorry, but I am not running a charity. It made much more sense to ask for a refund from Yifu and pay back as much as possible, without going into debt.
&lt;strong&gt;Why only a 50% refund?&lt;/strong&gt;
With people who paid with PayPal taking a 100% refund, it leaves a lesser share for everyone else. I am sorry, but that's how it is. We do not want to be owing hundreds of thousands to PayPal. Also, with some customers contacting our bank with fraud accusations, Chase has shut down our bank accounts. In my opinion they were just looking for an excuse. They have already contacted us in the past, asking for more information about our business, just because we were a "Bitcoin related business."
&lt;strong&gt;Patience is a virtue&lt;/strong&gt;
Now, you can either be content with the turnout of the whole fiasco and stop attacking me personally, and wait for your refunds. Or, you continue accusing me of being a scammer, and continue publishing my addresses publicly and tarnishing my image. Its up to you. Some of you have already done a lot of irreparable damage, not just to me but to all the TerraHash customers. And please remember, that there is only so much that I can take. If pushed into a corner, I will defend myself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So here's the deal, I work for Deloitte and I love Bitcoin.
I have been trying to raise the profile of Bitcoin within the company for a while but for a global consultancy firm that actually works with most of today's largest banks, and which typically targets established market opportunities that offer a low risk profile - I gotta be honest it's a hard sell!
Anyway - I've finally had an article approved for the Deloitte public blog, if I can drum up enough interest I might be able to convince the powers that be to let me write a white paper on Bitcoin, which in turn just might lead to a conversation happening between two people important enough to change the way a large organisation thinks about (or even uses) Bitcoin.  I think that would be a good thing.
My ask is this:
1. Read the blog: it's short, and you might even like it!
2. SHARE IT using the buttons on the page
It is the SHARES that are measured, not the views, there is a quarterly in-house scoreboard and if I can top that list we'll be getting somewhere.
I can't promise much in return, no children on the way any time soon but a possible cat on the horizon, if i can get 1000 shares i will name the cat Bitcoin. 
Thanks for your time

I think that is what I am getting at though (thinking out loud here).... 
with our current banking system, I don't need to remember anything other then my pin for my debit card and while this is not ideal for security issues, it makes it "dumbed" down enough for all users to use.
I can just foresee a huge backlash if allot of people start using bitcoin and then via somebodies dumb luck or mistake lose a ton of money, you see where I am going with this?
Right now bitcoin is just easy enough for technically savvy people and mistakes do happen all the time, I myself have made a few and lost a bitcoin, it was heartbreaking.

The U.S. government is really cracking down hard on bitcoin lately, I won't be surprised to see coinbase go next. I have a sneaky feeling though that this is all just a ramp up to cleaning bitcoin up so that "they" can get their stinky hands all over it.
It just means that they are taking bitcoin away from the "little hands" so that it can "safely" go onto the "real" exchanges aka nyse, nasdaq etc. I expect that we will experience some serious volatility very soon and then quiet and then some seriously good news. If you have the balls to hold or purchase through the dips that are sure to come then you should come out alright.

Stop looking at bitcoin as just currency or even a payment system, even though that is what we are seeing used as today, that is not nearly what can be done with it.
Bitcoin is a P2P, Decentralized, Global, Open Source, Proof of Ownership system.
The value that a transaction on the block-chain via colored coins or other mechanism can contain can literally be anything, from stocks, bonds, smart property, a voting system, wills, deeds, proof of invention, a pdf, an mp3, as well as a system to allow for off-chain micro transactions, etc. etc. etc.
tl;dr; bitcoin is so much more then just money or a global payment system.
See the following videos for a tiny hint of what bitcoin can become.

Chips Delivery Update, September Edition 
Due to events outside of our control, the delivery of chips have been delayed so far. While the situation are improving and chips are shipping, we have ultimately decided to revert our policy on no refunds and offer the option for customers to request a full refund(in bitcoin) if so desired.
The link to the request form is below, please note this only applies to orders made earlier than June 1st.
In other news, for those who decided to wait or wish to know more about delivery schedule will be glad to note we are receiving a batch of 400,000+ chips on Wednesday, with that we expect to be in good shape for meeting the upcoming deadlines of chip deliveries for orders made in June and later. 
In addition, we hope to wrap up generation one, finish shipping the chips, construct the modules and build the 2 module Avalon mini, put this pre-order mess behind us in general and switch gear into 55nm production, tape out generation 3, and start work on improving chip design for generation 4. Only sell what we can produce in a day on the assembly line, and only what's in stock.

I may have not explained myself fully, what I am thinking of is a Credit Union style fully accredited/licensed SIPC/FDIC insured bank that is bitcoin merchant and user friendly.
Currently I do not know of any single bank in the US that has come out and said "if you buy, sell or are a bitcoin related merchant we welcome your business"
I would use the Credit Union model, so that the users of the bank are also shareholders.
Would it last? Would it get ostracized by the incumbents? Would it get shutdown by the feds, I don't know the answer to these questions but to me this is an idea worth debating.

Today, 05:08 PM
Guy’s, below we have some photos to share from our packaging house in Asia who are currently are in possession of our wafers; slicing and packaging the dies into the chips you and we so badly want to get our hands on.
The finish line is in sight. A few sleepless nights yet, but we are doing everything we can to keep our delivery promise. This is nail-biting to say the least.
Going to post some more hosting facility pictures on the forum later today as well. So look out for those. They’re from last weekend, something else we’ve forgone for the immediate future. Let’s just take a moment to thank or very understanding wives, and children, who have been exceptionally restrained and understanding considering the last few months. We’re all looking forward to making amends on some lost time there.
However, there are a couple of pictures below, we know you’ve anxiously wanted to see. As you can see we’ve managed to etch our logo onto the die itself. To give you some idea of scale, the logo itself is just under 1mm in height;
