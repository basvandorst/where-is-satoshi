bitmex does trade against their customers... so sometimes the "someone" on the other side is a professional trader working at bitmex that has insider info (he sees all the open orders and stops and can make the server "overload" so your orders don't go through)
this isn't even disputed, they are pretty open about it. (except the overload part, but thats pretty obvious as well)

you sent money to a service
the service got your money, but didnt credit your account with it
chances are the service isnt legit, or they just suck
post link to the "online market place" (guessing some dnm?) and maybe someone can give you some insight if its legit. if it is, contact support and ask "wtf where is my money it has 53 confs"

you can use [bitcoin lightning wallet on android](
non custodial, just as good (if not better)
only difference is you have to open up some channels and get some people to make incoming channels to you (which isnt hard if you google a bit, theres many free services)

It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.

1.) you need a swiss mobile phone -&gt; you can't get a swiss mobile phone without id. so this basically ties the bitcoin to your Id (kinda). back in 2017 a noob friend bought literally thousands franks worth of bitcoin from these, he said they would block this number once he bought like 500.- / 2000.- worth (can't remember the exact amount) so he just started using the number of friends and family and asking them to send him the code... he got like half a dozens numbers blocked for buying "too much" lol. he has a bitstamp account now after I made fun of him and explained how he paid way to much fees.
2.) the fees are really high

if you sell, its never gonna drop to the level you are looking for, then itll start pumping and youll either be left with no bitcoin or youll have to buy in higher.
stop gambling. investing is long term. what do you care if it goes up, down or sideways if you aren't looking to sell any time soon anyway?... oh what's that? you could make EVEN more money if you time it just right? sell the tippy top, buy the perfect dip, be a millionaire by tuesday. that's GREED, don't listen to it.

no, under normal conditions losing power will never lead to loss of funds.
the problem with this dude was that he forced closed all his channels at once while they werent synced... why he would do such a thing is beyond me, but recommending a UPS to run your own ligthtning node is insane. maybe just stop fucking with stuff you don't understand and you won't randomly lose any funds
srsly tho the problem here wasnt that he lost power but that he forced closed at a weird time.

When you open channels all the capacity is in your favor, so you can only use that channel to pay and not receive. Once you make a payment the channel now has funds on both sides which allows you to receive money using that channel, which is something you want
In general you mostly open channek
Ls and don't close them as you can reuse them often. You do NOT need a direct channel with someone to pay them

After college she can't find a job so she starts working at mcdonald/starbucks to try and pay of her debt, but she makes so little shes barely scratching the interest, so she gets a second job. Meanwhile debt collectors are getting increasingly aggressive and are calling at all times of day... She applies for a housing loan but is denied because of her bad credit
How many dollars did she "invest"? $110k + an undefined and unlimited amount of interest. What does she have to show for it? Fuck all... A useless degree and a mountain of debt

Thats the whole point of lntip and lightning
Lntip is a 3rd layer service run on reddit, so you already withdrew it and are currently in possesion of 42 sats (on reddit). 
Lightning is a second layer solution run on bitcoin. If you want to receive those sats on your lightning wallet all you need is a channel with at least 42 satoshis worth of incoming capacity. The transaction fee can be ignored as its less than a sat
Its only when you want to withdraw from lightning to onchain by closing the channel that you have to pay a transaction fee
Tldr: you dont have to pay a fee

If you actually informed yourself on how bitcoin works youd know that more people using does not mean more power used.
In fact all evidence points to the contrary, that bitcoin is actually very good at pushing renewable energy. Bitcoin miners always want the cheapest electricity and the most efficient miners. Sometimes the problem with electricity is that you got too much of it in one place, bitcoin mining allows that excess (usually very cheap) electricity to be used by moving the miner to the source
Ive seen some estimates that put the % of mining done using renewable energy staggeringly high

Lol ethereum
Doesnt even have a monetary policy
"Well keep printing until we stop..." Does not make for a sound monetary system
Also needless complexity will introduce bugs and i have some serious doubts about PoS working at all (hence always being a year away)

Theres some pretty good articles out there that explain why and how bitcoin mining is pushing renewable energy
"Stranded hydro" is a nice jumping off point in regards to the "too much power in one place"
Its all just one google search away if you are ACTUALLY curious

There is no minimum amount really
I open channels for 20k sats which is like 1 buck
Actually lnd may enfloce a minimum of 20k sats per channel now that i think about it
Id just trsnsfer like 50 bucks initially

comprehending numbers this large really is hard for us... almost impossible even... but the number of possible bitcoin private keys is so big its safe to say its impossible to guess... even if you used all computers available on the planet for thousands of years doing nothing but guessing you still wouldnt scratch the suface thats how big these numbers are...
there are 904625697166532776746648320380374280100293470930272690489102837043110636675 x 128 possible keys

Theres a reason we call them shitcoins yknow
You dont hold altcoins, you pump and dump them
You hold bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-14 04:56:42


Its impossible to guess the absolute bottom
Best you can do is spread your buys around the area you think the bottom will form and see which get filled
And if you dont think its going back up... Why would you buy it? 
@_date: 2018-12-13 05:53:02
I said most people... Im doing fine ;)
@_date: 2018-12-31 02:12:15
You are NOT mining bitcoin. You are mining some altcoin using Lyra2REv2...
Take your numbers (7.5 hashrate / 1200 watt) and plug em into whatomine.com and that should give you a pretty decent idea how much you are making
Chances are you are losing money after electricity... Thats wgat happens when you a buy shitcoin miner with no reseatch at all

go draw something on 
i recommend you draw a penis
for larger amounts: buy something, when you use a channel to buy a tshirt or something youll have a channel with $15 worth of incoming capacity (or whatever the shirt cost). you also get incoming capacity if someone else open a channel with your node, so if you have a node thats reachable ill gladly open a channel with you :)

Shitforks dont retain value or interest
There has been over 70, no joke... How many can you name? How many of those are still worth anything at all?
Nobody cares about bitcoincopper or whatever dumbass names rhey come up with and most of them arent even listed on an exchange (the ones that are are basically worthless with no volume)
