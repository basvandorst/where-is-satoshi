Over 43% employed full time?  Meaning over 50% do not have full time jobs?  So it really is a bunch of neckbeards living in Mom's basement, living the dream?

Remember, bitcoin holders are mostly male and young. The employment rate for bitcoin the holder demographic is *way* higher than 59.7 percent.  This is an almost meaningless statistic with respect to bitcoin holders. You are including everyone over 60, 70, 80 years old. And stay-at-home housewives, and kids age 1 to 18.

Preach brother. We're all really learning something here. What are you going to do in your 3rd week on reddit?
@_date: 2019-11-01 03:51:26
Meanwhile, 32% of subscribers on are "*hodling*" because "we're going to 'da moon!"

I bet you way fewer people care to talk about bitcoin over the holidays than people on this forum think.

If you have money in a "Savings" account... maybe investing isn't for you, either.
@_date: 2019-11-28 06:03:38
Oh. Right. Totally over my head. Dur dee dur... I realize you've been on Reddit for 2 weeks. I have so much to learn, sensei.
@_date: 2019-11-27 01:08:58
The fact you even have to ask...  You should talk to a local adult about this, and they'll explain.
@_date: 2019-11-28 06:07:53
How do you convert your bitcoin to $ without using an exchange. Isn't there always some window of opportunity you could get screwed?

All in all, how is your "investment" going? What is your rate of return? As long as that is good, why would she care?
@_date: 2019-11-27 01:06:35
If the price was going to 'da moon(!!) you'd say "Who cares about that other stuff, look at muh price!!  Oh. Duh. I just saw you've been on reddit for 1 week. Never mind.

I read as kind of a comic relief. But this post is it. I can stop now. Nothing will ever top your comment. Bitcoin is being used by a bunch of pedophiles, but "at least we have people actually *using* bitcoins..."   And although the example at hand being one of the worst possible crimes "I hope it will raise awareness ...  not just criminal stuff."   
Amazing. Simply amazing.

I'm  not sure if you are trying to make a point or just ramble about your life? You avoid tech and never regretted it? That sounds like HORRIBLE advice. You've been buying gold for 50 years? Horrible advice.  Maybe this is a language thing.  You are giving a cautionary tale?
@_date: 2019-10-27 03:28:01


Withhold? You think in media org's they are they are sitting in a room and the edit is yelling "No, no. We need to sit on this!"  You realize anyone who cares can type 'bitcoin' into google and see the price? No information is being withheld. They aren't covering it because 95% (99%?) of the population doesn't care about a one or two day swing in bitcoin prices. 
Also, there are people securing their wealth for the future without speculating on bitcoin.

So it is like this:
A: I'd like to buy this hammer. I'll pay you with MyCoin, which is based on some math and an algorithm a friend created. If you agree to this math and algorithm, then 0.0000000000142 MyCoins are worth this hammer
B: But... wait. You just came up with this math/algorthm?
A: Yes. Some unknown person made it up, and a few of us like it, so we use MyCoin to buy hammers. 
B: Why would I take this over $5?
A: Because with MyCoin, there is a *fixed amount* of MyCoin. And it came from math.
B: That's it? There is a fixed amount of made up coins from this algorithm? And since it has a fixed amount and comes from algorithm, I should accept it?
A: Yes
B: What if I don't want to accept it. My friend has a coin called OtherCoin he likes. Maybe we should use that coin?
A: Oh yeah, there are hundreds, maybe thousands of coins out there. New ones are made up all the time.
B: So there is a fixed amount of each coin. But... there are many of these coins, with new ones being created?
A: But if we *all agree* MyCoin is the one true coin, then there is a fixed amount.
B: Why MyCoin?
A: Because I own a lot of MyCoin. And it was here earlier.
B: So we want everyone to just agree on some form of exchange, like MyCoin, because... we all agree. Kind of like money?
A: Exactly. Unlike money, you can't make new MyCoins. There is a limit.
B: What happens to people who are late to the game? If MyCoin is all the "currency" in the U.S. or the world, then people who got in early will be super rich, and people who are late will be poor?
A: Yes. That is their fault for not being so insightful. How much purchasing power you have will be mostly decided by getting in to the MyCoin early. If you are a life saving doctor, or an entrepreneur who creates thousands of jobs... well, sorry. I bought bitcoin, and you didn't. I'm worth 0.0000000001% of the entire worlds wealth! Ha! Ha Ha Ha.
B: But what if we agree on OtherCoin instead? Or some new better coin?
A: That would be wrong.
B: Why
A: Because I own a lot of MyCon
B: OK. I get it. Anyway, the hammer costs $5
A: OK. Here's $5
B: Have a good day
A: You too!

What if getting into bitcoin turns out to be a bad idea. Right now it is mostly hocus-pocus based on nothing -- let's just all agree this new thing is the New Thing, this is the new currency.  The people who are going to go for this know about it.
@_date: 2019-10-27 03:30:06
What if you buy large profitable tech companies, and sit on them for a few years? Lots of people make a profit trading in the market.

Do you actually understand the meaning of satire? There is a not-to-subtle difference between satire (which I really enjoy) and just being a douche. Satire also has some component of humor. You aren't even close I assume you are a teenager? Still figuring out how the world works, how satire works etc. Maybe tray again after you've gown up.

So.... art is an ineffective way of storing value, so bitcoin will be worth more thank $100K. OK. Go it.
@_date: 2019-12-03 05:00:50
The price of "art"is a complete scam. 
So... that is how you know bitcoin will go to 100k? I don't get the connection.

Just because they dropped those charges doesn't mean there wasn't enough evidence. There was a lot of evidence. One reason they were dropped was he was already locked up for life, so no reason to pursue any further. Happens all the time.
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:59:59
Are you seriously proposing that there should be an effort to give 5 and 6 year olds bitcoin, 'cuz the'll tell their friends, and that will spread awareness/demand?

"Everyone?"  I heard someone say they could not believe Obama won his second election, because everyone she knows didn't vote for him. I mean, what is going on??   &lt;-- do you see how silly this sounds. That is how silly you sound.
You think bitcoin rose because it entered main-stream public consciousness? You think consciousness has hit max saturation? Walk down the street (not silicon valley) and ask 50 people what they think about bitcoin. Maybe 5? 10? will even know what you are talking about.

Would you admit there some history to the US dollar that bitcoin doesn't have? It is like comparing Judaism to a religion I made up last week.  Yes, the are both religions. They are based on "faith" etc.   From a 8,000 year view, you might consider Judaism and Scientology to roughly be the same.  Bitcoin is more like  Scientology. One guy one days says "Hey, I'm going to make a new religion" (or form of currency). Who wants to join the party"   Sure, you can do that. But it really isn't the same.
To say the US dollar is as baseless as bitcoin is naive at best and completely misleading at best (hence some people see it as a scam). In some ways the US dollar is the global currency of the world.  On the other hand Bitcoin is 0.001% of the world population saying "Hey, look over here, we've got a new currency here!"  We just made it up a few years ago.
@_date: 2019-01-17 19:13:15
I know this is a subreddit of bitcoin lovers, but many people could make a good argument bitcoin itself is a scam. "Let's all get together and make a new form of money. It is based on, well... nothing, but if we convince enough people, then we can exchange it for dollars."

Because buying with a credit card is not at all like giving your private address to whomever... blah blah blah.  Not even close. You either don't understand or forgot about all the checks and balances, and fraud protection in place if someone took more than the transaction.

Very sad to read about his death, it sounds horrible. But brings up a question -- what if he is the only one who has access to his bitcoin? Same question for anyone who is safe and secure with their keys. You get hit by a bus and... no one can ever access your bitcoins again?  Isn't this the same as "losing my password?"  So what do you do -- share your passwords etc. with you spouse? What if the spouse is in the car when you get hit by the bus.  Oh, I guess I need to share my keys with a 3rd party just in case? But... but muh security!
Seriously, how does everyone deal with this situation, or have most people not thought it through?
