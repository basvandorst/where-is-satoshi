I want in on the beta...let me know what I need to do!!!

Ha ha ha!  You're funny!  I feel bad for you if you actually think Paycoin will be $100 in 3 months.  You'll be lucky if it rises to about $5.  It's time to wake up and smell the coffee.  You didn't buy into a great new innovative coin, you bought into the GAW hype train.  Sorry for you investment my friend, learn to think on your own the next time instead of following the words of the self declared Hashking...

Paycoin is not a scam.  It is GAWesome!  Ha ha ha!  What a cult that effin place is.  It is an embarrassment to the crypto community!
And I say keep his damn money, then he can get a taste of what it feels like to be one of his customers.  Just "promise" him that he can speak at a later date.

And hashtalk is now falling apart.  Rampant Mod bans, abusing their new found powers...

He will say that some super revolutionary, innovative, never before seen paybase feature is coming out and his time would be best spent in the office to make sure that everything gets released smoothly.

Hashtalk is falling apart...take a look at the censorship.  Even senior members and ex mods are getting irritated:
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:20:53
They weren't letting anyone new sign up because all kinds of new accounts were joining and questioning the validity of GAW and paycoin.  Hashtalk didn't like that.  Instead of countering the accusations, the just banned the users and closed registration to new users.  That doesn't make them look guilty at all.  They want the so called "trolls" to stop messing with them, but every thing they do they add more fuel to the fire.  Now then got a new mod that apparently let the power get to their head.  That mod is banning everyone that doesn't praise GAW.  Counter arguments, forget about it...banned.  Question a date or a feature...banned.  Just want to let you guys know, you are destroying Paycoin youselves...amazing you don't see the light you are so blinded by greed and faith.

It's not gonna fail...it is gonna be GAWsome...just ask all the HT sheep.
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:05:44
Well now some new mods are in place and are super ban happy.  If you don't praise GAW you get warned via PM and then banned without warning.  And they say they don't censor and wonder why the rest of the crypto community despises them...this is why.  GAW and Hashtalk are single handedly the two worst things possible for the crypto world.  Paycoin to the moon...ha ha ha!  What a joke!  Can't wait to see what lies Josh promises this week.  At least soon they will have the forum completely steralized and only Pro-GAW.  I can't wait till this all goes under and all of the GAW sheep finally get to see the light.  Cause they are too damn arrogant to see both sides of the story...let em burn!

Notice that GAW and Scrypt.cc aren't listed as scams on Badbitcoin.org.  And it just so happens that both of those companies pay to advertise on the site.  Interesting.  Credibility?  Badbitcoin.org just lost it all shilling for GAW.  Such shame too...had the potential to be a good, trustworthy site.
At the very least, he should put a disclaimer up that he invests in GAW and Paycoin.
@_date: 2015-03-23 11:22:03
that site makes no sense to me.  they will call any site a scam just looking at the home page, yet will defend paycoin and GAW to the bitter end.  Personally, I have no respect for that site if you refuse to see the scam that is GAW.  Not a neutral party to run such a site, it should be shut down as well.
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:11:02
If GAW gets proven to be a scam, no questions asked, and Badbitcoin.org supported GAW and the scam...would Badbitcoin.org have to list themselves as a scam on their own site?  Oh the irony.

All lies!  Paycoin to the moon.  Josh has never failed us.  Josh is GAWD.  Lets change our religion to GAW.  Group buy, group buy!  $20 floor!  The honors program is still happening, Josh said so!
And those are comments from just 1 hour of conversation on hashtalk.  And probably after Josh just cryptically said that the $20 floor is done and the honors program is done as well.  They praise him for stealing their BTC's.  That forum makes ABSOLUTELY no sense...it is a reverse reality.  Much sad.
***Not to mention the fact that Josh Garza that just halt the transfer of his customers funds at any point he wants.  That alone should scare every living soul with an IQ above 40 to stay the hell away.***
GAW is a joke.
