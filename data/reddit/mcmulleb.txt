Good time to put your money in crypto instead.  
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:08:52
Ok that makes sense.  The thing cost 21 million BTC, but that’s not saying you have to pay in BTC. Gotch ya. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:10:11
Thanks.  But F em.  I’m giving good advice, and ETH is hardly a shill.  I’m not going to stop giving sound advice.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:43:28
I’m not telling anyone to take a “huge” risk.  Don’t invest more than you can afford to live without.  Don’t use your rent money, don’t get a second mortgage etc.

Any guesses why?
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:28:09
Or watch him go from $100 to $50 in 90 days.  We will see.  Actually I won’t, cause I don’t care.  
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:23:50
I could see it falling into the 1-9k range. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:57:17
You sound bitter and are probably projecting. You took a huge risk and are currently underwater huh? Wanting to get rich fast? Don’t have enough patience to wait a year? 
I’m telling people not to panic sell. If you are selling to buy back, fine; but inexperienced people will likely lose money trying that.  
And YES, if you are not a day trader, HODLing is not a bad strategy.  Tell me a time where HODLing crytpo would cause you to have less value in a year or two?  If you held through the same crash last January (or the crash the January before), would you be better off today? OMG yes.  
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:27:10
You can sign into Gdax with your coinbase info

Blockchain is not just currency. It’s also about smart contracts.  The technology will benefit all areas of the globe economically. The more all areas of the world are producing, the better we all will be. Things will be cheap cause competition and supply. The more rural counties are connected, the more they can contribute; I.E making solar panels or something, which d/t the increase supply will make it affordable to more.  But make no mistake, the people who get into cryptocurrency early will have the most wealth; which will be disproportionately be wealthy countries.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:41:53
And you shouldn’t be worried about this money because you Never should invest more than you can afford to live without for at least year.  Buying at 19k, is still a good investment after a year, but don’t get impatient.  If you are stressed, it may be a sign you invested too much.  
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:50:08
Ok. Go!
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:53:15
That’s assuming price is at 11k.  If you bought them all, the price for one would be through the roof. So 234b is not enough. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:48:14
No. 
Unless you want to buy bitcoin, and need to open a credit card or get a personal loan to buy some. But this would be really stupid.  
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:31:08
This would be nearly impossible.  For the scenario, you would have to own all the bitcoins; and if you could purchase all, the coins market price would be like million each (probably more), as there are people that would only sell for a high price.  If you could buy them all, you would have like 21 trillion in value; not saying you paid that much; that’s just the value.  If you wanted to buy something more than 21 trillion, yes, you might have an issue.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:01:40
Probably true.  But what did he really do?  He owes everything he has to the hard working people that created and worked to grow bitcoin.  Buying bitcoin years ago is smart, but doesn’t mean you had to do anything productive for society.  Reminds me of those memes about how everyone feels like an amazing trader when the market goes up.  But I don’t blame him for opportunistically taking advantage of the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:48:52
Yeah. Totally illegal. Duplicating someone else’s product and making money off of it.  If you bought the Harry Potter series, made copies and sold it for $20, you would get sued and lose.  
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:14:56
Remember for tax purposes; trading for USDT or selling for USD, are both taxable events and profits need to be reported.  I would much rather sell for USD on Gdax.  But I realize some exchanges like Binance don’t have USD fiat options so USDT is an option; just seems risky.  
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:29:48
My response was to joren who was saying BTC would run out.  But to your point, I don’t share your same liquidity concerns. I like the fact that you can’t print more money like can be done with USD, but if you are worried about cash being injected into the economy, the gov can still do that with USD.  And cause BTC has a fixed supply I see it holding value, and becoming more accepted as currency, and in that case can have very quick liquidity.  Remember during economic depression, banks can stop people from taking out their money, so you are SOL.  And BTC is far more liquid than having real estate, or cars or most other assets.  If you are in a small country who’s economy is crashing, you could still convert BTC into fiat fast via exchanges, as BTC is a global currency and other people in the world still seek it; that can’t be said for all fiat currencies
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:12:23
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:05:10
I’m sure he would love that.  “Give me your 11k BTC, so I can have it when it is $7k”.  Get real.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:15:23
How so? I’m talking cryptocurrencies as a whole.  They are improving in technology, but I’m talking about the foundation and business process for sending/receiving, security etc.  You think returning to paper money that can be printed off is better? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:01:26
Yes. You would.  But purchasing power of a BTC is more, so it’s okay.  Looking back you would have made more earlier in your career, if paid in BTC, but that’s more of a product of investing early and not wage increase. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:45:25
Remember that a bitcoin can be divided down to 8 decimal places. Therefore, 0.00000001 BTC.  So it’s possible that .00000001 BTC equals $1.  So that’s 100,000,000 per BTC, which means the total market cap is 2,100,000,000,000,000.  So Bro, it’s never happening.  But .00000001; doesn’t have to just equal $1; it could be $100; or a million $. Which would make the market cap larger.  And any purchases under .00000001 BTC, or a million, you would just have to use another smaller currency, and only use BTC for house purchases for example. So Mathematically, it’s basically impossible to run out. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:18:30
Everyone can’t sell and buy back lower; there will be losers.  HODLing is the safe/conservative decision, and there are years of crypto data to back that up.  Sure, they can take a chance to make more today, but then they rise losing.  So my investment advise for inexperienced people, is don’t panic tell, and if you do sell, know what you are doing.  Is that bad advice? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:29:22
Either they are literally selling a plastic coin, or they are trying to dump stolen crypto, as they would have to register and provide too much info to join exchanges, and get fiat out.  
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:22:51
I think they love BTC.  But they are an investor group that missed the boat, and would love if it went down to $1000.  PS, if you own a Tesla, it’s crap and you should sell it to me for $2000; please.. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:35:09
Current value is only important if you are trying to sell right now.  If I have a Christmas tree farm, and the price per tree in the summer is zero, You haven’t lost anything unless I sell; HOLD and prices will go up.   People shouldn’t be in a situation where they “have” to sell right now.  It’s probably a sign they invested too much.  And I never said you shouldn’t buy to lower your cost average.  
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:07:25
Are you being sarcastic? I can’t tell.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:44:29
Buyers are waiting for a lower price.  And panic sellers are continue to ask for a lower price.  So buyers keep waiting.  When selling stops, there won’t be enough sellers on the way up to give everyone a good deal, and prices will go up fast. In a nutshell. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:36:24
Yes. But I know this is a long term investment, and I have full confidence that it will be up to ATH by next year.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:43:34
Exactly.  I’ve invested money I don’t need for over a year, and am confident it will increase in value over that time.  Nothing about cryptocurrencies have changed, it’s as solid as ever.  The only thing changed is the amount people are willing to sell their coin for.  This emotion will pass, but definitely heightened when you invest too much!  Once this bottoms out, I will pick up some more cheap coin.  
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:29:21
This is how I think of it.  No matter the price, Bitcoin is here to stay. The price is just what bitcoin is exchanged for outside the network.  It’s decentralized and no government can/would bring it down.  So the platform its self is stable.  There will be improvements in speed, it probably won’t be the fastest ever, but is fast enough.  Bitcoin is almost a cultural thing and everyone knows about it.  But Cryptocurrencies is still so new and only a small people are invested.  It’s my opinion that crypto as a whole will be much larger in 10-20 years.  And since I believe Bitcoin will always be functional, it’s hard to imagine the price stay at 11k.  In 10 years, the value of everything increases (just look at House prices a few decades ago), more people will be involved and economic gains over the years, will flow into crypto.  And for rich people it will almost be a status symbol, and as people obtain it, for no other reason than it being a collectible, will cause the price to rise, as there aren’t seller.  And give the planet has 7 billion people, that increase every year, the limited and coveted “Bitcoin” will be in high demand.

I’m not sure what site you are using, [STR]( for example has a legal Disclaimer section.  “Any unauthorized use, duplication, redistribution or disclosure is prohibited by law and may lead to prosecution”. I’m sure you can find this at the place you bought it from.  This is like 101 legal stuff.

Bitcoin isn’t going away, and if I could get it for $1000, I’d be stoked. But most likely this is just FUD and wishful thinking on their part.  Let me guess the Feds also “thinks” it will go to zero. Haha.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:30:11
As opposed to panic, yes.  Making decisions based on emotion leads to mental errors.   
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:32:46

What’s the difference?
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:23:07
This is just a day traders game; reacting to every bit of new, legitimate or not.   And given the relatively low volume, the price is more volatile.  Unless you are looking to day trade, don’t fall into their game.  They want people to panic, then need sellers, so they can buy their coin. If people don’t sell, then price will bounce fast and those whales loose. But there are plenty of people that are idiots and panic.  If you could see your portfolio is June, you will realize it is just fine.  Just cause people are selling their coin for so cheap, doesn’t mean you are losing anything; you still have the same amount of coins.  I haven’t lost a single coin today.  
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:59:01
Technically you would be paid less BTCs; but the dollar amount for one would be more, so it’s okay and your wage would go up in terms of USD, but going down in terms of BTC. What are you guys arguing?
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:59:54
This is almost like insider trading.  But dirtier.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:32:51
High risk, high reward.  You took a lot of risk and are paying for it.  My thoughts are that it will eventually recover. You don’t lose unless you sell.  I hope you can afford the mortgage payments for a while, which sucks cause you will pay interest.  Cause of that, It seems like you were trying to make a quick buck, rather than investing for the long haul.  Sorry.  
I think by the end of December, with Christmas, people just didn’t have to money to invest more.  And the rich were taking money out of BTC to try pump and dump  other altcoins cause it was a frenzy.  Wait until January, people will get paid again, tax returns will come in, business will start investing their 2018 funds.  The altcoin frenzy will calm down and funds will consolidate back to the leaders like BTC, LTC, XRP, ETH etc.  Give it a few months.  A couple bad weeks shouldn’t cause you to let one bad decision turn into two.  Good luck. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 01:14:43

@_date: 2019-06-22 20:59:44
If you look at the large patten, Bitcoins next run will go way above 20k.  Yeah, you should have add more a few months ago.  
I would consider buys some other top coins, not Bitcoin.  Example; ETH ($300 now) all time high was 1300; so to reach that it will quadruple.  If Bitcoin hits an ATH, it will only double from here.  It’s always a Ripple (not talking XRP) effect, Bitcoin shoots up, then the other follow shortly after as people use their Bitcoin purchasing power to buy the other coins.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:05:35
So you aren’t buying, but you want others to? That’s cruel and bad advice.  But I don’t blame you for wanting the price to rise. 
And I agree, Bitcoin is not dead.  But the market behaves differently, and the long term durability of Bitcoin, is not a predictor of the short term price.  I think it will take another near term dive, on its long journey up. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:02:38

Agree.  People are monkeys. You can’t trust them, especially not ones on the internet.  
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:09:03
Maybe.  I’m not sure what governments can do to stop crypto, as it’s decentralized and difficult to regulate.  And there is a lot of money put into it by large investors, which in America are the people that control politicians.  Like the internet, I think integration is more likely.  Banks have to know fiat currencies have many cons, so I see large banks either creating their own coins, or putting more money into crypto in order to stay a head of the game.  It’s a small few, trying to corral the masses, which in the Internet age is hard.  I think more and more regular people will accept crypto as they see it holding value more than fiat which can be printed indefinitely.  If they are to ban it, then they should have done it years ago, politically it will get harder and harder to do.  I see a transition, as fiat declines, more and more states will accept taxes via crypto (which some are already stating to do), as will businesses.  It’s just about taxes; it really doesn’t matter if it is crypto or fiat.

So dumb.   All you are doing is advertising for Bcash and helping adoption.  And if this does cause Bcash to go down, then from the time of the purchase to the time you sell on exchanges, you will be losing money.  If bitcoin goes up and Bcash goes down, BCH believes will just see it as a great opportunity and sell their bitcoin for Bcash.  You can’t manipulate the market price that much, especially if you are advertising it to people who don’t know much about crypto, and increasing the volume in the mean time.  Yes, let’s hurt Bcash by putting “Bcash accepted here” on all business.

If people only use bitcoin, then prices will be determined by the market.  In a hypothetical scenario when people only use bitcoin, then all prices in stores would be listed as BTC.  Then it’s just stores vs stores to offer the lowest price.  
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:44:23
In my view, crypto currency is an ecosystem, all working together.  Bitcoin can’t do it all.  The future will have point of sale coins like Nano, LTC. Platforms like ETH, NEO, ADA, and  a store of value coin like Gold ie Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is well know, decentralized, very stable coin.  Crypto needs it.  It won’t be an all-in-one coin that is also used for daily purchases, but will be used for bigger purchases that needs slow secure confirmation. it will also be used as a pair coin which all coins will be trusted to sell against.  Bitcoin is an investment coin, that isn’t going away.  It is top dog, thus won’t have as much potential for big gains, but it will be the slow moving conservative investment.  Portfolios should have a diverse mix ranging from aggressive to conservative coin; risk vs reward.  The ratios are your call but as your portfolio grows, its smart to move some into bitcoin.  Again, Gold isn’t a practical currency for daily use, but that doesn’t mean it’s worthless.  In fact, it’s the backbone on which the current system was built, and crypto needs a similar backbone, which is bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:02:19
Free market. People ask to buy at $6k, but no one sells to them. People want to sell for 20k but no one buys.  The price is where buyers and sellers meet.  It’s the same principle that determines how much anything is worth, like million dollar paintings, real estate and even used cars.  Bitcoin is attractive cause it is decentralized, secure and there is a finite amount that can’t be printed indefinitely like fiat.  Media can alter market psychology, which results in more sellers or buyers as a whole, which affects the market price.  
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:56:49
Yeah, it is a function of supply and demand. There is a fixed supply of bitcoin, with more buyers (ie the demand) coming into crypto every year.  The price has risen over the years, and I suspect more people using crypto in the years to come, thus Bitcoin price likely to continue to rise.   
Gold is valuable as it’s a tangible physical object, stocks are not, and rely on business process which can change or disappear.  In many ways, Bitcoin is similar to a physical object b/c of its resiliency, and d/t it’s decentralizated structure isn’t going away. The only problem with Gold is that we are coming up with better technology to identify gold underground before digging, and in the coming years will keep adding more and more to the supply, thus hurting its value.  
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:32:17

Also, once you sell, it affects your taxes.  So their are other factors.  Just saying.

Good luck. I don’t like your odds.  I don’t think authorities or the justice system is prepared to handle crypto yet.  A lawyer sending him a threatening letter is about as good as you are going to do; other than the baseball bat option, lol.   Be very careful with crypto.  P2P trade is risky. What were you trading for? If it’s for a coin, then you should have just sold BTC on Binance, then bought other coins.  
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:50:33
This is so dumb and doesn’t make sense.   If you buy their Bcash then you are helping them out, and selling bitcoin to do so.  If you then sell the Bcash, you better hope the price went up or you are selling back to that same Bcash holder for less and giving them money to buy more Bcash.  If you buy back bitcoin, you already sold to buy the Bcash so it is a wash.  All this strategy does is help the Bcash volume.  And having business accept Bcash, which just puts a extra step in order to sell it on the market, which is like a semi hold.  I’m not sure if you are stupid or a BCH Guy trying to trick people into doing what’s best for BCash.  The thing that will work is don’t buy it, and if you have it, then sell it.  It’s that simple.

Exactly. And they have the upper hand, cause they know when they will make the move and buy back. It’s the people that panic and follow them that get screwed over when the whales switch and buy up those cheap panic sells.

Well, they sacred people out of their coin. And now it’s time to pump and sell.

Promoting mass adoption gives investors a reason to buy more and justifies a higher price.  So now you are saying, “accept BCH, or they will just go to a competitor”. Is this a threat? You sound like a Bcash supporter, or you are just high. I can’t tell.

Bear market isn’t over yet.  The data and volume backs that up.  I think we are in for one or two more big declines, and hopefully will see capitulation.  Only then will investors be comfortable getting back in.  
I see the recent run today as a classic bear trap.  Some investors plow through these walls, and it gets individual all excited, who take over and can keep it going for a while.  But I do not recommend buying now, those large investors are going to soon pull out the rug.  Just my take.

I think it is going down to 9k in the next three days, then will have a good rally above 16k within 2 weeks.   But obviously no one knows for sure.  How much is your loan, and how much is due? Can you make a minimum payment?

He also declared bankruptcy in 2015, so legally he needs to deny it, or prior creditor could sue for that money.  I’m not sure if he did or didn’t; the prior articles were mostly reports, not necessarily 50 cent coming out and lying about having it.  Who knows, who really cares.

Anytime any coin increases by 600% in a day, people will take profits. Don’t bite now.

Yes.  If there is more overall buyers than sellers.

It’s too early to call.  There have been rallies the past 2 months.  After hitting an ATH, it crashed to 12k, then went up to 17k, and people were saying the same thing you are.  The three crashes since an ATH happen about 20 days apart, and we are only 10 days since our last.  So I’m 10 days, we will see. But I think you are early to imply we are out of a bear market.  The market goes up and down, and I don’t believe in FOMO.  Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.  I’d be very cautious about buying now, given the week long rally.

I don’t see it like that.   I think the internet had a bigger problem, of building the tech and networks, and the internet was up against the status quo, of brick and mortar buildings and political organization that don’t want people to have power, and news organization that controlled the media via newspapers and magazines.   Crypto already has tech and the internet, apps etc on its side.   What future opposition do you see for crypto? Government opposition? Business adoption? 
We all have different views and predictions, that’s just my take.

You can’t bring down bitcoin, you can only scare people into a temporary sell off.  Rise and falls in price will always happen.  But If he does anything, it’s to scare people, so he and his friends can buy low, then double their money a month later.

What do you have confidence in? What is currency? What is of value?  Do you value a piece of paper that can be printed indefinitely by people you don’t know? Do you find comfort in government?  I trust the tech and math of crypto, which cannot be printed indefinitely and is decentralized.  No one should put all their wealth in crypto, so the risk should be minimal.  Right now it’s an investment and has some risk like all investments.  But I trust its longevity and durability of the tech more than any corporation or person.  When you look back at fads of the Internet, you have to ask yourself, is crypto a fad, or the next Internet and infrastructure that future tech will be using.  We aren’t even to fads yet bro; we are 1990 Internet, and you sound just as dumb as the Internet skeptics of that time.  I’m sorry you don’t get it, but that’s your problem.

You should research the project, team etc.  the price of the coin is not an indication of quality.  That coin is very hard to find a place to buy, so low volume can easily raise price, and this was likely a handful of buyers.  It will go down, but the question is, will it go up again (at a faster rate that a higher coin).  If it’s a PnD, then the pumper will move on.  The only way to tell if it will go up again is to research the project.

Market buy.  But if you do limit buys it won’t take long.  I just checked on Gdax and 8BTC (80k) sells in like 10 seconds.  There is a lot of money moving around in bitcoin, 50k isn’t going to make any kind of buy wall.

Not sure.  Nano has had great volume as well.   I can’t speak to specific coins, but I know during the bear market this last month, many people were just holding cash.  The fact that volume is up is typical at the end of a bear market, when people start getting back in.  I don’t think the bear market is completely over, but it’s nearing its end; I think the cash is entering selective coins that are undervalued and some alt coins.  That’s just a theory.

It’s been a week of flatlining.  The sellers are running out, which gave the Bulls confidence.  We might have seen the bottom the last week.  I know, people have said that before during the past few months, but we haven’t seen a sustained floor like we have the past week, nor the volume.  Let’s hope the tide has turned.  
Back in January/February, based on past years, I thought April/May would be the end of the bear.  Probably will be pretty slow growth til Summer, and a big explosion again in Oct-Dec.  my opinion.
