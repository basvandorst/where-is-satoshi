There is a Russia market, which if I remember correctly peaked last Spring and then dropped down and leveled off. I'm looking for predictions regarding emerging BTC markets on the scale China has demonstrated recently. 
Certainly there are opportunities for individuals to buy BTC in a lot of countries. I'm curious about national/ethnic monetary cultures which might shift to favor bitcoin.

Hey y'all,
I've had quite a few nice transactions with coinbase now. They did what they said they would every time for me, even during chaotic moments.
Sorry to those that have had difficulties with them.
Everyone should realize that they are a broker, not an exchange. They set terms like a broker does, unlike an exchange which manages buys and sells and facilitates transactions between a variety of parties. 
When you are interacting with a broker, you are interacting with the terms, resources, manpower, availability, price mechanisms, etc., for the broker. And sometimes they will not be able to broker for you. So you will need to find another broker. 
But there aren't a lot of other online U.S. brokers, that's why they're a bit overwhelmed sometimes. So why not go directly to an exchange, and negotiate the buy/sell yourself?

Yeah! I'm waiting for India to get on board too. The conference is coming in Bangalore on Dec. 14-15, so I'll be searching for info on it after it happens. 
The government officials go to Hindu temples and ask them how much gold is in them. Not popular. It seems to me there is a lot of wealth there, not many good was to store it...

Yeah good call on Dubai, surely the richest country in the world will want to get on board soon. Crazy that markets haven't opened up there yet.

Thank you for this, I have been looking for global maps of BTC use. I'm still a bit new here and can't tell how much this particular bitcoin client reflects global use -- for example couldn't this map be used to compile data from global Multibit and bit bitcoin-qt downloads? Can someone walk me through how representative this is?
I posted a few days ago that I thought the next adopter would be India -- it seems to me they aren't fond of paper money over there and have a tech-savy upper class. How long before some rich Indians want to hire some computer scientists and some brokers and BTCIndia is born? There are already Indians selling BTC on ebay, but it's hard to buy from them because ebay wants you to be in India with an Indian bank account to buy.
It's nice to see some charts and maps, and try to get some predictions going.
