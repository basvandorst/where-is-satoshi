if its a rush then you have too much money in. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:05:08
haha had a laugh ��
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:33:45
there are a some threads on reddit where users lost their funds using Jaxx wallet. Its not always because of smartphone use. I wouldnt use it
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:52:46
same here, i am very concerned about btc not able to hold on rank  :/  .. bitcoin needs LN ASAP
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:55:20
we need them ASAP. Every day waiting costs momentum and is rsiking the whole project!
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:35:45
worst case is that bitcoin will become a digital gold standard which will be considered as a store of value.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:17:05
jaxx had several issues with users lost their funds. Dont ise jaxx.
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:02:11
no fees at all for the customer. It works like a visa debit card. TenX is the best debit card provider in cryptoland - no shill - just watch a video of cofounder julian hosp
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:50:52
it will be TenX card. Keep an eye in them. Most professional product so far
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:09:28
It would impact the market because many people will lose trust to the whole cryptoworld.. whats the next scamcoin which is going to crash over night? If Tether turns out to be not pegged by $1 the market will dip for sure but it wouldnt be the end.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:13:09
Card: 15$  - no monthly costs - if you spend less than 1000$ a year you have to pay a small fee about $10 - NFC will be supported in the future
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:08:56
sad but true
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:51:43
bitfinex has also a good selection
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:01:16
theres a good chamce it will be released in 2018
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:39:04
Kraken already runs on Segwit
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:56:18
haha . reddit you are a funny dude
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:21:03
of it only doubles i am out..
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:36:32
bitconnect was known to be a ponzi sheme that will burst in the future. Every smart person knew that and it was no suprise. Tether is still given credit - most people see it as a legit token - so it better stays legit, right?
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:54:15
i would put it in an ALT because they are all bullish now. 
After the pump is over i would switch to BTC
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:57:53
what if i tell you we are already at moon - we are going to satuuuuuurn!!! we will come!!!!!!!! aaarrrr!!!!! :D
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:38:47
nice, but you dont calculate the fact that there are tons of shitcoins which get hyped crazy and catches big marketshares. I hope BTC remain  on coinmarketcap
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:20:45
it would be fine if there is an incentive for providing a lightning node. This would help growing the network.
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:13:10
i think centralized exchanges will stay for a while because they can be controlled by CEOs who can provide terms of compliance which are neccesary due to regulations coming in the near future. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:06:20
this would be too risky for me. trust must be earned first.
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:07:55
yes but pretty high fees even with BNB
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:58:41
dont cry please
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:26:40
i think that was an impulsive reaction because BTC was decreasing his dominance.. but he also thinks ETH will surpass BTC - which cant be excluded imho
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:45:39
The company TenX will distribute debit cards you can load BTC and ETH on it.
Then you can use them at any place where VISA / Mastercard is accepted. You can also withdraw from an ATM with it.
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:06:23
whats the cause of the dip?
is it coincheck? 
i keep hodling anyway!
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:31:24
when LN?
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:43:09
the dotcom bubble was not about the internet or the use of the internet itself... so this is a bad comparison..
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:00:08
we have to hodl thats all i know - no matter what - weak hands will lose money ober time thats for sure
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:45:08
Kraken has saveral technical flaws but they have pretty decent deposit and withdrawal management. Once Kraken works more fast it is good exchange with low fees
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:31:02
nope. Only HODLers keep the price high. FOMO bullruns are just pump and dump.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:57:02
BCH.. Bcash.. LoL
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:44:12
Kraken works pretty well so far. They have many technical issues and slow order processing, but they are quite trustworthy
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:53:31
i hope so, but why do you think so ? The market gets flooded by tons of shitcoins people invest in
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:47:08
In the end Roger Ver is harming his own coin and community. Bcash is doing Bcash things. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:31:54
no offensse to women. i think women have more balls than panic sellers around here
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:52:41
why? i thjnk BTC marketshare is decreasing and that makes me worry. i am still hodling - never sold btc in my life
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:20:30
dont be mad - enjoy life.
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:57:20
yea definatley they are about 3.5 billion women out there - so much potential to pump BTC to the next level :P
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:08:33
thank you
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:36:15
i wouldnt use salt, but i think it could make btc more popular
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:24:10
possible.. but this is a long road..cant see this in the near future
minimum 5+ years
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:37:41
of course they dont know it - me either, but i am tired of this bad comparisons.. you cant compare bitcoin with stocks, fiat, or anything else than bitcoin itself and predict a bubble crash just because it happens so many times in history. The only thing that bitcoin has in comon with stocks is both are traded on market places. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:26:17
never go full retard
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:35:00
to get replaced by another cryptocurrency .. biggest competitor is imho DASH.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:10:16
there are only a few people who made millions of hodling btc.  Most of them sold before they reached 1000% on their inital investment.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:06:12
you are right. the price crashes only because of the weak hands setting up their stop loss...when there are far more hodlers everything would be fine
dont sell before 1mio pls. thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:51:07
you da real mvp. nice mindset!
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:52:02
i know but they will survive anyways
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:16:23
If it comes to a crash like 2008 bitcoin and co are a save haven.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:50:00
because if btc reaches 100k then theres room to grow further
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:18:48
its a long road to moon .. you cant see it from now here 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:56:17
you forgot the hot wife, amazing children and that clever dog :D
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:21:51
Dont gift money. Just dont. You are not helping anyone with that. Seriosly. That has nothing to do with beeing egoistical. People who are in financial struggles have to make their own way out of it. Otherwise they wont learn it ever.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:46:26
same here.. have many people around who want to sell bitcoin after a small gain..in fact they just want more fiat.
i wont sell even if btc reaches 100k next year.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:19:35
cant believe we are nearly 2018 and the trading platforms working that slow..
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:59:30
next step 20k - price predictions for 2018 anyone ? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:52:50
maybe its roger ver himself
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:45:04
there will be some legal frames and regulatory due to money laundering and other criminal posibilities...but bitcoin (or other popular currency) can still grow.. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:13:31
bitcoin can easily! reach 1 trillion marketcap in the near future. that means 3-4x
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:17:27
i will always upvote such reclamations to be visible. So many exchanges are really bad in providing the service we pay for.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:52:42
maybe you are right, maybe not..
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:34:15
i love the idea but the marketing and the brand must get better.. the url sucks.. must be a shorter brandname with a more sounding url
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:22:43
lets kill all the bad exchanges so the rest become better..make a popular blacklist page 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:36:36
I downloaded the official wallet to test how it works and it seema to me that this technology is in an pretty early phase. The Tangle mechanics is not ready to be used in machine to machine communications yet. Every Sender of IOTA has to mine 2 transactions to send his own transaction to the network. So every sender has to habe some decent  CPU Power to use the network. To me this is a big problem because many devices in the Internet-of-things company wont be able to provide this CPU-Power. 
I think IOTA has potential, but for now it is wheigh to overhyped. Wouldnt pay more than $0.50 for 1 MIOTA now.

Da Real Bitcoin Jesus ������
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:54:49
yes it dipped pretty fast .. overal market cap was about 352 and now dipped to 341 wtf?
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:55:00
you can buy things with bitcoin even today with a TenX card
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:05:00
yes, but does it last long until uber or some other app that has the same functionality of uber comes back? i think things like this cant be banned forever
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:31:49
Of course they can ban it, but is it a good choice? I dont think so.
You cant ban technological progress... it will do more harm to the countries.. they isolate themself.. thats the road to become a state like northkorean..
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:07:12
move your BTC to different exchanges. split the withdraws. otherwise sue them.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:01:31
* Satoshi Nakamoto
* Vitalik Buterin
* Julian Hosp
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:14:06
also the light wallet has to mine 2 transaction before attaching the own transaction to the tangle
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:27:12
i also bet that the government wont allow it.. but i think they wont be able to ban it.. like they cant ban Uber and Airbnb..
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:18:44
i think they syncronize very slow - i want livesync to coinmarketcap but blockfolio cant do this :(
cointracking.info works better.

@_date: 2017-11-22 15:36:23
i hope so, because i want continue buying
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:24:58
come on this guy compares bitcoin with stocks and fiat.. its neither one of them..
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:33:48
if it comes to mass adoption it will get to the million. But first the scaling problem must be solved. 
optimistic: end of 2020 conervative 2025.
BUT: theres a chance that BTC wont be on rank  forever
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:26:03
thank you for the link, i hope it will work better in december.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:20:11
depends how much cryptos you have.. if you have more than 10k$ then a hardwarewallet for 70$ seems like a good investment for some extra security
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:01:30
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:59:24
He can also split the coins to 5  different wallets.. so theres no wallet with such a high amount.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:45:21

its really annoying.. cant believe they cannot afford a faster trading system..
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:09:00
next correction at 11k back to 10k.. 10k is new support
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:25:25
"buy 2 get 1" sounds like a good deal ��
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:18:45
I can tell you kraken meet all your preferences but they are very slow and orders are often declined because of the slow servers. If you just want to buy and hodl then kraken does the job..
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:41:40
yes you are right, but i think the brand and popularity will bitcoin help to stay on rank  for a while. McDonalds doesnt make the best burgers, altough the selll the most.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:44:36
this wouldnt surprise me ����
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:29:48
better use money you can afford to loose...nobody can tell you where BTC is in 2 years.. of course i think it will grow but i wouldnt bet my whole savings on it
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:06:11

@_date: 2017-11-30 07:12:17
Its always the same argumentation
- comparing Bitcoins with stocks, currencies, tulips
- Guaranteeing the bubble will crash
honestly - If you are a sure what you are talking about then show some balls and take a short position on bitcoin. its your chance to make some nice money or isnt it?
Otherwise its the prove you doubt your own words.. its just a very unsecure opinion you self dont believe in and just throwing into reddit..
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:48:48
thats no surprise kraken is down.. they are always down or damn slow.. not even a snail could trade there
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:07:31

@_date: 2017-11-16 18:15:09

@_date: 2017-11-26 09:37:44
just "bitcoin" would be enough :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:58:44
seems pretty plausible.. when it comes to price predicitons i tend to be more conservative but when you look at the network effect and  its exponential growth you can see that theres is room fur such big gains in little time..
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:10:47
you know it will happen.. next step 1mio

here we go.. lets climb to 100k 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:33:18
i am also on kraken and they are damn slow.. really damn slow.. i advice everyone to go to another exchange.. they cant be worse than kraken. This is really bad management happening there.. cant belief they store such big amounts in therer coldwallet while they are unable to provide a good platform...
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:21:59
Bitcoin will gain in price, but i think there are some ALTs that will grow faster
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:52:54
mayber theres a small dip.. but i dont care.. BTC will grow in 2018
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:45:47

@_date: 2017-11-27 07:22:38
Sounds good, but i think there could be some dips caused by some factors we dont recognize by now
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:02:50
i also believe in bitcoin, but if it cant handle small transaction it will decrease in marketcap and value over time. Because the most used Cryptocurrency will have the biggest marketcap.
Once the scaling problem is solved, everything is fine.

thats nonsense because if there is no demand for buying bitcoin to this price, then the price drops until there is someone who wants to buy it.
No matter how much electricity was being used to mine a btc

It was built to confuse people and attack the real bitcoin BTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:33:12
very nice! What a statement..
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:45:00
huobi sucks pretty much too..
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:47:20

@_date: 2018-02-05 15:03:49
yeah they already lost real money and regreting it
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:06:27
finally the quick-rich guys get washed away
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:35:01
The big problem here is how to bring the verificatikn key of one human being on the blockchain. Fingerprints, FaceID ? How to manage this? There must be some kind of "middlemnan" who confirma this for at least once. But i am confident there will be a solition for this in the future
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:04:48
people like you have lost so much money im the last 9 years and also will so in the future haha
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:26:36
lock in your loss now!
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:33:08
its only backed by peoples trust. If people believe the utility of bitcoin will grow (bc its a nice payment method or store of valie etc) so the demand will increase while the supply stays the same (max. 21 mil) --&gt; price is the result of demand and supply.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:27:33
because the whole world will go crypto and china would be isolating themselves.

Berkshire Hathaway to wiretransfer $80 billion to bitfinex. Warren Biffet wants to 5xleverage pump BTC to $90k !!!
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:24:30

@_date: 2018-02-05 15:53:35
then sell pls
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:35:01
man thats sick.. just keep hodling and everything will be fine
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:08:39
there are two types of people who fit your description:
- people who lost money with bitcoin and are mad on crypto. Also people who sold too early and want to see BTC tanking
- nocoiners: they want to be right about that crypto is just gambling. They want to see the bubble burst. They want their coworkers who have btc to lose money instead of making gains.
Both of these people will live with much regret. Have a nice day!

Binance and Huobi are not based in China or Hong Kong
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:13:50
its FUD. Market will go up to 4-6 trillions at its ATH in 2018. Mark my words. Here is the first time you heard it.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:28:46
3 months is a decade for crytpto .. never assume that todays prices affect the next 3 months man.. it could be anything
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:43:49
nice buying oppertunity! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:01:12
this is right but you cant predict patterns too...the only thing you can do is buy,hold and sell.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:13:50
I dont buy this. The chines government  will remain to be against crypto until there is an significanz event. I dont know what that would be but for now, i cant see china moving into a crypto friendly future. They want to ban exchanges. Pls think 10 seconds about what that means.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:00:42
where is the guy who  bought at 19k? ��
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:28:41
not weeks man - you are the quick buck guy, right ? it will go up over years.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:02:43
  China is not a crypto friendly country. Forget it. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:14:29
more adoption - 5% of world population !
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:48:20
off course there is market manipluation and many other risks. There is no guarantee that BTC will hit  *any amount* . Its specualtion with high risk. You cant predict the value will go to zero because there is a chance that BTC gets mote adoption and utility, regulated, better functinality etc etc. I am bullish on BTC and other cryptos but i know it could decrease in value too. Thats why people should always invest what they can afford to lose.
what kind of value are you looking for? gibe me an example that i know what you mean.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:13:27
bitcoin ended many times man.. and there have always been panic seller who live in deep regret... even comitted suicide after BTC went up to 10k 
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:20:59

@_date: 2018-02-05 16:26:58

another pussy who will lose all his savings.. byebye
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:52:24
i am hodling too..and it feels pretty right man
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:58:49
you are mad against hodlers because you dont have the balls to do so.
Hodling feels right at the moment. I dont care about dips. I would be fine with a total loss because i dodnt onvest more than i can afford to lose. Thats why hodling is so damn simple. All the panic sellers will get burned.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:58:35
i dont think 5k..  there should be a support
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:57:23
yea i bet you made millions with this already haha
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:59:11
you will always lose money over time

@_date: 2018-02-05 15:54:18

@_date: 2018-02-04 16:36:55
you maybe right with peak popularity.. but not peak industry-popularity where the real whales and money move in. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:21:37

@_date: 2018-02-05 09:17:51

@_date: 2018-02-05 09:50:13

@_date: 2018-02-06 10:57:10
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:28:35
