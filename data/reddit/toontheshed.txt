Question: Why are you selling coins for cash? Why not sell them on an exchange that does transfers to fiat?

No sir! There's many differences

I am honestly curious why people still love bitcoin more than some of the other coins out there. To me Bitcoin is popular now just because it was the 1st coin to gain popularity... But there are better cryptocurrencies out there now and we're seeing them increase in value as Bitcoin falls

It's possible, yes

Right now Monero and Ethereum. I think Dash could have problems. ZCash is like Bitcoin with opt-in privacy option, but ETH is implementing zk-snarks so it will have opt-in privacy too at some point... Some people are saying this was the goal of ZCash all along. Monero is completely anonymous throughout the entire blockchain

The GUI swing wallet for linux was out like 4 months ago. I was using it through VirtualBox. I think [this is the one for Windows]( however I haven't used the Windows GUI Wallet

Some features cannot be implemented without entirely changing the way the blockchain functions... might as well just design a new coin. That's why Ethereum is gaining popularity because you can host things on its blockchain.
