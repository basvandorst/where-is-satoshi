Did their deal expire? I'm trying to purchase the "gift pack" but when I apply the coupon the price doesn't change.

Ledger Wallet ships from France and Trezor from Czech

Wouldn't that be nice

Bitcoin is already hard enough to obtain and such a hassle for users to sell.. I've sold a couple to people who wanted to get into it but had no way to get them.
@_date: 2014-12-22 11:03:00
Well, since the tracking number said they were waiting to receive the package I thought a shipping label was created, but wasn't actually shipped yet. Can't wait to get it!
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:02:57
You usually pay a fee when using your car at another branch ATM.

Tried signing up now and they are not accepting new customers at the moment. :/
@_date: 2014-12-29 06:02:00
I use Trezor to store bitcoins and send a couple to MyCelium for everyday use.
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:10:46
But you're still not fully verified. You have to then verify your identity and then make a purchase and wait 30 days.
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:18:55
I don't think you get 5 minutes anymore.. I bought 2 BTC today and try to cancel a minute after and I wasn't able to. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:54:50
Isn't the limit $500? is it increased based on frequency of purchases or what?
@_date: 2014-11-11 07:49:58
I know how you feel. I'm going to buy some this week and was hoping to get them cheaper than this... even though I personally think this is a steal..
@_date: 2014-12-22 02:56:17
How long did it take to arrive? ordered one Dec 10th and hasn't shipped yet
@_date: 2014-11-02 07:10:35
They are trying to make it easier.. not everyone wants to send wires and have to take pictures of the receipt and such. Circle verification is a lot easier.

Yep.. If I had a family to support or any other responsibilities then I wouldn't take the risk. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:43:54
Thanks. I hope to use your services in the near future.
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:24:05
Hopefully with zerocash that won't be a problem anymore.
@_date: 2014-11-18 08:22:01
I think I'll go with a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet.
Thanks everyone!
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:11:01
They give you $500 instantly and Coinbase gives you $1,000 when fully verified.
@_date: 2014-12-30 23:47:45
If you have bitcoins for everyday use then you don't really need a trezor. An HD mobile wallet should be enough, but if you're trying to store a decent amount of bitcoins then you should take additional steps to secure them. Do you usually keep cash around your house? or do you store them in a bank or safe? 
@_date: 2014-10-26 00:40:38
Try Circle or Coinbase and then transfer the coins to an exchange?
@_date: 2014-12-30 08:43:00
Trezor is compatible with Electrum 2.0

I'm trying to buy bitcoins though, not spend them.
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:01:54
Yes, told a cousin I had around $30k on BTC and he wanted me to let him borrow some money.
@_date: 2014-10-30 01:55:09
Why would we need a leader?
@_date: 2014-10-24 01:33:58
I believe those posts because that used to happen to me countless times till they fixed it. I really like Coinbase and they were the first BTC company I "trusted" but they should manually check user accounts the algorithm flags instead of automatically canceling transactions. I buy a couple BTC every week and I always have this 'fear' that it might get cancelled at the last minute.
@_date: 2014-10-28 18:22:17
No one is saying it applies to personal transactions. If I buy 1 BTC from Coinbase and sell it to someone then I would have to be registered as a MSB.. fuckk thattttt
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:19:31
I can't wait to get it. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 06:02:46
@_date: 2014-12-22 21:55:45
This is pretty neat, buttercoin offers this too.. but around the same waiting time as if you buy $50k and wait 4 days since when you deposit USD it has to clear
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:10:36
I know, but a there are a lot of BTC users in N.Y, I'm not blaming Trucoin.. New York is going to make it difficult for everyone.. sadly

@_date: 2014-10-26 19:32:33
Indeed. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:10:45
Withdrawals != Deposits..
I don't know if it has been posted before but my chinese buddy sent me the link about 30 minutes ago.
@_date: 2014-12-30 07:37:08
I would have to go with the Trezor. The build is pretty good and I like that you have to confirm the transactions on the Trezor itself. The Ledger Wallet is pretty good for it's price. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 04:49:58
I would pay the fee and save me the trip. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:36:06
I rather not. I don't want other people to handly my private keys.
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:35:03
Putting them to good use. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 04:39:58
Have you been able to register with them? I have been waiting for a while now to receive an invitation.
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:17:12
What? with Coinbase? 
@_date: 2014-11-06 07:48:56
lmao 300 bits 
@_date: 2014-11-05 23:48:22
The fee is already included in the price.. so if you pay $30 for 0.1 BTC you'll get 0.1 BTC....
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:43:04
That's great. Mobile support is a big +1
@_date: 2014-10-31 04:42:08
It'll be easier for him to buy using his bank account at either Coinbase or Circle. If you try using a debit/credit card at Circle they might ask for additional information and make it a pain in the ass. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:22:39

@_date: 2014-11-04 18:05:50
This was needed. Great things happening for the BTC community.
@_date: 2014-11-02 06:55:30
I think Circle only ask for more documents if you're using a credit card. I've used Circle a couple times with my bank account and it's been smooth. I never had an issue with either Circle or Coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 20:21:14
I think Circle does have fees but they're included in the BTC price and Coinbase are just more 'upfront' about it.
@_date: 2014-12-22 10:18:33
I bought it on Dec 10, when I check the tracking number this is what it says:

good luck
@_date: 2014-11-07 03:32:12
Is this where this picture is from? 
@_date: 2014-11-06 02:49:48
Then you should contact support and see what's going on because mine took 3 days. Coinbase takes a lot longer.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:43:28
Yeah, sucks for the customers living here.
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:00:43
I wonder who actually sent those letters to exchanges.. are they going to suspend deposits/withdrawals? or did they plan this? either way.. I'm going to sell and wait 
@_date: 2014-04-30 20:38:05
Couldn't have said it better myself.
@_date: 2014-12-23 00:42:33
I know, I use buttercoin.. was just saying the service is similar :p
@_date: 2014-04-15 23:44:44
That doesn't mean huobi is now not freezing deposits/withdrawals.. thinking of selling at this spike but I don't know
@_date: 2014-12-22 09:38:57
Lol no.. he would then laugh and talk shit, I just told him I can't use that money for a couple years.
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:36:48
Then you're not fully verified. I'll take a screenshot when I get home of the 30 day wait requiremen.
@_date: 2014-10-30 20:26:39
Selling them locally to people?
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:11:24
If your account is fully verified then Coinbase lets you buy up to $1,000 instantly.
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:00:28
"Unfortunately, you must be a U.S. resident with a SSN to be verified with Coinbase at this time. The third party service we use, to verify individuals, can only pull data from U.S. public records. My apologies that it's not more clearly stated on our site. However, you will still be able to open an account/wallet and utilize our secure bitcoin storage method for sending and receiving bitcoin."
@_date: 2014-11-13 02:40:59
That's my fear with Coinbase. I bought 4 BTC around Friday-Saturday and they could just cancel my order because it was "high risk".. They should verify accounts on a case-by-case basis.. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:56:57
Don't they store your private keys? that's risky. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:53:39
I have been using them for around 3-4 months and never had an issue with deposits/withdrawals. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 07:48:23
The Ledger Wallet was delivered within a week via UPS and the Trezor took around 2 weeks and a half via USPS to the U.S
@_date: 2014-11-03 00:37:10
Has anyone verified their account? I'm interested in how you could deposit USD but I don't want to provide my passport information.
@_date: 2014-12-22 10:51:22
It says it was shipped and gives me the tracking number, but on the USPS website it says they're waiting to receive the package. I'm not complaining btw
@_date: 2014-12-30 08:19:29
haha but you're probably the only one who's into Bitcoin, right??
@_date: 2014-11-05 23:37:00
Circle is actually cheaper than Coinbase. 
Circle's fee are included in the price, Coinbase is more 'upfront' about it.
Circle purchase of 10 BTC price: 
Coinbase:

What's your Circle weekly buy limit? just wondering. I've been using them for a couple of weeks and it's still at $2,500. I'm hoping my limit is increased soon. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:08:48
Their closest location is 200 miles away.. :/
@_date: 2014-12-24 10:53:43
Circle, Trucoin, Buttercoin
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:03:40
This seems pretty cool.. but I would rather use my own paper wallet or something like trezor..
@_date: 2014-11-05 23:38:45
Circle. They require less verification and typically take about 3 days to get your BTC and $500 instantly and Coinbase takes 4.. but if you completely verify your Coinbase account (takes 30 days+) you'll be able to buy $1,000 instantly.
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:00:10
Indeed it is.
@_date: 2014-10-27 03:31:53
I think it would make people more open to the idea of paying with a Bitcoin wallet if they're paying by scanning a QR code which is similar.
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:11:04
Where is it? I don't see it..
@_date: 2014-12-19 09:53:37
$350.. I don't need the money for now.. I barely check the price anymore, buying a little more with whatever I have left after expenses
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:38:16
That's what I'm saying!!
@_date: 2014-12-21 23:45:21
Honestly, I like both... 
Coinbase has been around for longer and requires more verification, once fully verified they have a $50k buy and sell weekly limit.
Circle requires less verification and allows you to use your Debit/Credit card. They have a weekly $2,500 limit when buying with your bank account and $500 for Debit/Credit card. What I don't like about Coinbase is they can cancel your transactions due to being 'high risk' at the last minute and this hasn't happened to me with Circle so far.
@_date: 2014-11-07 02:45:06
Can you include the sales tax in the price?
@_date: 2014-11-18 07:26:01
If I don't find any other way then I'll use a paper wallet. Thanks mate!

@_date: 2014-12-17 07:41:11
I think you're thinking about bitreserve.org.
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:04:31
You should be careful when buying from random people.. give Coinbase a try or Circle
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:31:19
Nope. You're not the only one.
@_date: 2014-10-25 20:20:40
My bank account was verified in a couple days and everything has been smooth ever since. Good to have other options to Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-11-20 17:51:28
I believe they're using Coinbase to convert the BTC to cash..
@_date: 2014-10-28 18:20:39
You still have to register at the federal level. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 07:23:59
I don't think a lot of people would buy if they had to show their ID and etc. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:00:44
umm.. wierd.. Florida is listed on the list..
@_date: 2014-11-04 06:50:28
Bitcoin does have fees.. just really cheap compared to other alternatives. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 11:27:07

Coinbase does ask for the last four digits of your social when you verify your identity... then it ask for a credit card and then to make a purchase and wait 30 days..
@_date: 2014-12-22 10:23:19
Doesn't that just mean a shipping label was created and they haven't received the product? 
@_date: 2014-04-17 06:36:54

@_date: 2014-11-16 09:54:10
They should really stop saying BTC transactions are free of charge.
@_date: 2014-12-29 07:58:04
Yes, but I usually send 5-6 and that's enough. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:48:58
I don't trade there but if their website got compromised then I might sell now. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 04:31:58
Yeah, you're right. I just tried it again and I had 5 minutes to do so.
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:05:26

Why is Trucoin currently not available in NY? are you planning on extending to NY?
@_date: 2014-11-02 07:03:55
They're both facilitating the way users can purchase BTC but because regulations and how risky it is selling BTC they have to take extra steps. The price is about the same.. Circle includes the fee in the BTC price and Coinbase doesn't.. but it comes out to be around the same price.

Wouldn't I have to get a new copy of wallet.dat every time I sent BTC to my wallet? I plan on buying around $200 worth weekly..
@_date: 2014-10-25 23:21:47
That means I would have to get an ID from everyone I sell to and write their name and save it?
@_date: 2014-11-05 04:06:25
I would've just gone to my bank and pay the $3 transaction fee they charge. Why is your bank so far? I have around 10 banks within a 2 mile radius.

You should receive it faster then !

@_date: 2015-01-08 05:01:58
This is pretty cool.
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:49:50
Would be nice if I could use it.. but keeps crashing
@_date: 2015-01-10 09:42:32
Did MyCelium synchronize with the network? it should show your actual balance.
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:05:15
I have used it before but I like MyCelium more
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:43:53
can't tell if you're trying to convince us or yourself
@_date: 2015-01-10 10:20:11
Well, if you had the money in your account then you should be able to recover it with your master seed. Use a different phone/wallet to recover from master seed or give your seed to someone you completely trust and have them do it. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:35:48
so inspirational, you should put it on a picture with a tree as the background
@_date: 2015-01-10 10:34:17
Give this a try: web.hivewallet.com 
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:53:19
 no one cares about LTC anyways
@_date: 2015-01-08 08:57:21
Yes, my network is fine. Bread Wallet, Blockchain and other apps work fine.
@_date: 2015-01-11 08:24:18
Yeah, if you're going to donate then don't donate 100 bits...
@_date: 2015-01-02 09:46:18
@_date: 2015-01-10 09:49:32
Next to your balance there should be a reload arrow, I was also having issues with MyCelium last night and made a post here.. they were having issues with one of the iOS server, but they fixed it and has been working fine ever since.
@_date: 2015-01-15 12:44:56
He didn't 'lose' anything.. there's a different between potential gains and loses.. if he cashed out now he would still make a ton of money
@_date: 2015-01-10 10:59:28
Ahhh, just tried now and you're right, I assumed since they're both HD and Bread Wallet accepted MyCelium master seed the other day they were compatible. Tried with Hive and it worked.
@_date: 2015-01-08 09:57:02
Oh god... I hope you're wrong.. I can't even imagine..
@_date: 2015-01-10 06:41:06
You would have to get a Money Transmitter license and sign up with FinCEN.. I was looking into this, but not knowing what's coming with the BitLicense kinda pushed me away.
@_date: 2015-01-08 10:44:01
I've turned the phone on and off a couple times and have tired uninstalling and installing the app again, get the same error. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:44:17
$167 buckle up
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:32:57
@_date: 2015-01-12 07:13:45
u wut m8
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:27:25
Yeah, but most of us are aware of that. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:41:28
What you would've lost would depend on the price you got in. You don't see any type of innovation or adoption for LTC. I used to trade LTC when my holdings were smaller and sold after BTCChina added it and went all in BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:20:26
I'm afraid it hasn't stopped yet..
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:31:57
I think the thing is that nothing like BTC existed before and it could completely crash so some people aren't sure
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:18:39
Where have you been m8? Charlie Shrem is currently unavailable cuz ya know.. prison
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:14:12
We don't blindly trust a company or person. When there's a new company you see users asking questions and questioning them and they call them out if they ignore their concerns and such.. but I guess.. sometimes...
@_date: 2015-01-15 06:34:39
I've used Buttercoin before and they're fine. They should provide support for IE but if they don't then just another browser man
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:27:07
no, this is bad and you should feel bad
@_date: 2015-01-10 07:42:31
For that amount I would probably use a paper wallet or something like Coinbase Vault
@_date: 2015-01-10 07:49:31
They offer multi-sig.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:27:57
money is relative, that might not be a lot to him and $1k might be a lot to some people
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:42:52
How much are you willing to bet?
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:31:09
This was happening to me a couple days ago, I used a different browser and it loaded fine. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 05:26:35
Nice cold storage option.. instead of paper wallets we could have puzzle wallets and store different parts of the puzzle in different locations
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:19:41
Here Trezor is compared to other devices and paper wallets:  - I personally love Trezor, easy to use with great security
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:24:04
I got one and I love it. I don't think they have a promo going on at the moment.. I could be wrong though
@_date: 2015-01-09 08:30:02
Would that be the case for any changes made to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:25:43
I have an order at $243 and it isn't being filled but shows someone buying at $243.7? 
@_date: 2015-01-10 08:08:25
No, you don't make a transaction from the vault, you can only deposit or withdraw, to withdraw it takes 2 days and read here:  
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:08:21
See what
@_date: 2015-01-11 09:34:27
@_date: 2015-01-10 05:52:39
They could be using hardware wallets or something similar that is secure.
@_date: 2015-01-10 08:49:55
You can restore the 12 word seed with MyCelium
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:00:15
do you mind explaining?
@_date: 2015-01-10 06:59:36
I used to sell on LocalBitcoins for a 10%-15% premium depending on the amount and would make around $1,000 weekly and I live in a small city.
@_date: 2015-01-02 09:36:20
The community doesn't want him to speak. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 10:33:13
Yeah, they both use BIP32/39/44
@_date: 2015-01-09 08:34:02
I see. Thanks for answering my question.
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:18:46
Check weusecoins.com
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:58:16
Yes, now it works. Thank you!!
@_date: 2015-01-11 09:36:01
Chipotle, bills.
@_date: 2015-01-09 08:04:23
I have been using them for a couple years and I never had any issues with them. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:54:23
Went to Hashtalk to check it out and it feels like a cult. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:12:51
I'm not familiar with OKPay, but that's what they're planning to use for fiat
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:09:04
And how does this apply to the current situation?
@_date: 2015-01-09 07:41:54
I don't see how this could affect the block chain.
@_date: 2015-01-11 09:34:15
I heard in a conference say they're going to be using OKPay which is irreversible.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:44:59
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:14:03
Yeah, Tony Gallippi did a good job answering all of her questions though.
@_date: 2015-01-15 07:58:10
Try using your phone 
@_date: 2015-01-10 09:38:03
Restore your seed on MyCelium wallet, Bread Wallet isn't working for me either.
@_date: 2015-01-08 09:06:15
Yes, version: 1.01. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:12:42
I sold, buying later again
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:47:49
Expect to see this on buttcoin soon
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:45:46
Made me chuckle. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:41:22
bugs have been found, more bugs could be found and Bitcoin is as valuable as people make it to be, i think what would keep the price afloat is the DNM.. Microsoft accepting bitcoin doesn't mean much considering they just convert it to fiat
@_date: 2015-01-15 06:32:09
IMO Trezor is the best way to store them at least for now 
@_date: 2015-01-10 21:47:22
That is because it hasn't happened to you, once it does you'll most likely come here and complain as well
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:13:38
Depends on location. I can't order food online or pay bills. I can't spend them anywhere where I live and I'm in the east coast.
@_date: 2014-04-15 23:43:29
How do you know that? stop assuming shit.. 100% in coins
@_date: 2015-01-10 09:45:30
Bread Wallet was taking a long time to sync for me and then it wouldn't show any balance. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:55:33
It's just so simple, my favorite iOS app so far.
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:20:14
I'm aware I need to wait, I'm not complaining? I only asked OP to see how long it took him. If I needed it faster then I would've chosen DHL, there's no need for this.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:55:33
24h volume: 199775 
@_date: 2014-12-25 08:31:26
Maybe he bought more than $1,000? or maybe he had already used the weekly instant limit?
