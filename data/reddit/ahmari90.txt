I try to. I’m usually the one telling people that lol.  I’m just not exactly sure how the support levels are determined. I assumed it was buy/sell orders but they seem to move pretty fast 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:50:21
Wait. Best advice I can give you 
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:39:46
I’ve been able to. I get an email confirmation from Chase
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:48:02
Awesome. Thank you
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:26:31
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:56:42
God willing man. Thanks for all the input 
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:06:00
USD wallets are FDIC insured on coinbase/GDAX. Insurance covers hacks/cyber security threats 
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:01:02
You got it man
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:09:04
You can get rich shorting the market. Good strategy during a bear market. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:53:41
Awesome. Thank you 
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:17:46
Not sure about that
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:27:07
Right on. Thanks for the heads up 
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:47:00
Haha yeah. It’s a good experience for people like me. I’ve got a much stronger grasp on the market now. Still got a lot of homework to do tho 
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:41:01
Yeah I’ve been in crypto for a few months now. I’m heavily invested in alt-coins and ETH. My knowledge on statistical analysis in crypto is sub-par tho. I’ve been intrigued more than anything since the correction, considering the phasic movement to BTC we have in the market when we start to bottom 
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:10:01
Insurance only covers USD wallet 
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:14:38
Yup. No problem 
@_date: 2018-09-26 06:32:41
The bottom line on the wedge look so arbitrary. 
It’s going through candle bodies and wicks. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 16:39:53
50 cents 
@_date: 2018-11-19 07:04:52
Bear market. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:58:49
They suspend withdrawals all the time. I’m not buying it. We’re in a bear market, that’s why Bitcoin dumped. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:02:06
Oh my bad, I misread what you said. I thought you said it WONT drop to 5k. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:10:07
Shorts. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:18:38
It means a [death cross]( is on the horizon if we don’t see a trend reversal soon. Read about it and understand it
@_date: 2018-11-30 23:07:44
I heard bitcoin is great for exchanging into quarters. Good call. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:50:01
If the US dollar collapses the world is fucked. That’s nothing to cheer about. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:53:53
Douche. 
And that’s coming from someone who bought close to bottom. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:46:37
Don’t invest based on memes. Most of those people are inexperienced. 
Learn some TA or check out r/bitcoinmarkets daily discussions. The guys there have some good knowledge about the market. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:22:59
That’s a really bad metaphor. Downvoted. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:58:57
So you think the only way BTC will drop 37% is if there’s some crazy global event? 
Get real. 
It already dropped 60% in 3 months...
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:54:55
Could be 500k could be 1k who knows 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:08:48
Feels like August 16th, 2024 to me 
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:27:33
Can’t be a bull market 100% of the time. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 23:59:17
This article basically said nothing. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:12:16
Looks janky. Switch banks. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:59:47
Would someone with schizophrenia pass a lie detector test?
@_date: 2018-07-20 18:33:25
Collapsing? Lol
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:50:24
Yeah that’s what I was thinking as well 
@_date: 2018-12-01 01:11:29
Haha I’m just giving you a hard time. 
I think banking has been evolving the way it has because of all the fraud that’s out there these days. 
Banks are making people jump through hoops to create paper trails to cover their own asses. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 08:57:55
Makes sense. It’s a speculative asset class. 
The price is dialed in with hype not utility. 
This is a lagging indicator though.
