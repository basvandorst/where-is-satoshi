Yeah, what noob would choose the favourites to go through.

No worries, most of the UK sites are pretty well policed, you can't go wrong with either Bitty or BitBargain

I'm surprised that Thom Yorke doesn't accept it, Bitcoin is right up his Street.

This is for merchants to receive payments.

I always send in GBP as they give an much better exchange rate than the banks here. Did you give them the reference requested?

Seriously? Rimbit? Am I going to use this to pay for naughty sexual favours?

Good stuff. I felt the same way when I got a lightning quick reply from Cryptsy

A lot of people, myself included are put off by monthly donations. I would much rather the as many different avenues of donation as possible to choose from.

How long ago are the coins put into the wallet? Be interesting to see how much they were worth when they were forgotten

Even the Tories were surprised that they managed to get a majority, the SNP and Labour royally messed it up for everyone.

The problem with mass surveillance is that they don't under the guise of catching "terrorists", I'm pretty sure anyone with anything to hide will still be able to using the right tools. It's just the rest of us that have nothing to hide that have our personal lives intruded upon as if we were guilty of something.

You should always have 2 factor authentication where there is money involved.

For the moment, until the next ruling goes the other way.

It's a lot more work for someone to be paid every day. I have my own business and pay myself every 2 weeks for ease of accounting. Personally, I don't see the need to be paid every day.

Your paper wallets are great, even a noob like me managed to make an Ubuntu thumb drive to make some offline following your instructions. Thanks very much.

Because the people selling do it to make money, there used to be great margins back in the day. They are supplying people instantly with BTC with easy payment methods like local bank transfer and Paym. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 04:31:11
That's an instant 5% profit on an exchange.

I would look for a trusted seller on Localbitcoins.com, personally I'd rather send my money to another business (trader) rather than risk the questions a bank will likely ask when you send money to somewhere well known like Bit Stamp.

Bittylicious.com, I have gotten BTC in a couple of minutes after payment has been sent, you need to make sure you give the correct reference number. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 08:48:57
Thanks very much. I understand that you can't predict the future but I'm just looking to give myself a little more confidence in the decision making. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:03:51
How did you get on? 
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:44:06
Start trading with your Bitcoins, sell them, buy cheaper ones and sell them, repeat. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:56:45
Are you using a wallet client like Multibit? You may need to reset the blockchain, if it says that they are there on blockchain, they will be there.

Www.bittylicious.com is probably the easiest site to use in the UK, I've used it plenty.
