This is a strange question. Erik sold SD for around 120k BTC. The site was a gambling site which was unlicensed in the US == quite illegal.
Now, I'm not sure if paying taxes on its sale is a good or bad idea. Does that draw more attention to it? Or is it better to keep the IRS happy and pay your dues?
Unfortunately for Erik this info is very public.
It's pretty much a money laundering issue and needs the proverbial car wash.

The legal way to do this would be to incorporate outside the US (or move yourself) and carry out your activities through a business domiciled outside the US. Simply moving a server wouldn't work in legal terms, even if you were to gain access.
IANAL but have wrangled with this kind of stuff a fair bit.. get some legal advice and other disclaimers apply of course.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:30:51
I don't believe the site was operated in the US. However, there were most definitely US citizens using it. Most online gambling sites are blocked in the US for a reason i.e. it's illegal for them to take money from US residents.
When you declare 120k BTC as income, the tax liabilities are going to be pretty high. So you have to declare where the income originated from. I guess you should have a pretty good story about that unless you want to get busted.
It's even worse that he's a US citizen and is responsible to the US IRS. Couldn't have it worse than that.
Hence the conundrum.

Ira, on the subject of counterparty risk, how would you protect against low bitcoin liquidity events? I understand your service pretty well but I am just concerned about what level of liquidity you yourself maintain.
You know how banks are regulated to maintain 8% cash reserves or 12% or higher depending on the country they are in. 
Now this might be a 'trade-secret' for you, but as someone who understands a few little things about the global financial system (and therefore loves bitcoin as a result :P), I must ask you this - How will you protect your users against a 'bank run' ?

I understand that you're 100% reserve for unlocked BTC. I just want to understand the rest of it..
Say I have 15 BTC in my wallet.
I lock 5 BTC to USD and keep 10 in my wallet. I know you're going to keep these 10. My understanding is that the 5 I lock will be traded for USD on your supply side. Let's assume BTCUSD is at 500 USD/BTC (after your spread). So you'll basically hold 2500 USD for me.
Now I know a USD liquidity issue is highly unlikely (and the world will have bigger problems if that comes to pass), you'll probably always have enough USD or find enough somewhere in the world to pay that out. But since you only allow people to get BTC what I understand is that my BTC withdrawal amount changes based on the price fluctuation.
From past experience I know that there have been long times of slow or low activity on BTC exchanges. I assume it is those times that your spread would go up to 4%.
So my understanding is that at best you're a 99% lock and at worst a 96% lock and all this is subject to the fact that you're able to trade the **underlying back for BTC**. That's the reserve I was asking about.. how many BTC are you willing to keep on hand to meet those obligations in the event that you are unable to enter back into BTC.
All in all, I think it's a great service for people who are new to bitcoins. It lets them get into it without worrying about radical loss of value. It's especially useful in a bear market or during a downward trend. Helps new users still get on board without losing money. Well, thanks for having the vision for that. :)

I'm not based in the US so KYC/AML regulations don't really apply. In fact, Dubai's pretty much the opposite - money laundering heaven, so to speak, even though that is NOT the intention at all.
I figured it's important to start something with BTC that wouldn't break local regulations left, right and center. The only way to tackle that issue is to use bitcoin for the one thing it's good for - cross border payments.
EDIT: Also, no sales or interest shown so far :( I'm wondering what the best way to market this would be..

Thanks for the response.
Alright, I bet the corrupt in China certainly have a battle tested way of getting money out of there without using BTC. I know that the corrupt in India certainly do. BTC is just the new kid on the block for these people, I doubt they would move that kind of volume through BTC (we're talking BILLIONS of dollars).
What prevents the Chinese government from just asking Bitstamp for all the info on Chinese citizens using their platform ? Using a bitcoin exchange for illegal money is surely going to create a 'trail' especially because they *do* ask for your documentation before they let you trade. Yes, documentation may be falsified but there are more details available (IP addresses, etc), yes, all those things can be circumvented as well but why go through all that when you can use a network similar to hawala for just 5% vs the 25% shaky exchange rate through bitcoin ?
Furthermore, to move money out of Bitstamp they would still need to have an overseas bank account somewhere in Europe or the US or anywhere else. What prevents the Chinese government from asking Bitstamp for details of BTC withdrawals and where they were wired to from Chinese account holders ?
I don't know if Chinese people can or cannot buy property overseas but I'm from India. Our capital controls are also very tight (not as tight as China though..). However, there are legitimate ways of getting your money out (fill up a few forms, etc.), right now an Indian can send up to $1MM out of India per year provided they fill up a few forms with the purpose of the transfer, etc. It's a bit of paperwork and you even need to get an accountant to sign off on it but it's doable.
But, none of that applies to illegal money. To get money into BTC China would not be easy through illegal means. There is a paper trail/electronic trail of some sort. To buy bitcoins there will leave another set of trails. Moving those bitcoins will leave transaction info, selling on bitstamp needs ID docs and transaction info, withdrawing money from bitstamp would leave ID and transaction info as well as the destination bank details alongwith KYC/AML forms for those.
Assuming all of the above was illegal, it still seems like a crazy way to do things. The Chinese elite will certainly have their own ways of getting their money out of China.
Lastly, it would be naive to assume that a small market of $5-$10 Billion (fairly illiquid on top of everything..) would attract the money laundering attention of the rich and corrupt in the world. I don't know about corruption in China but only small time corrupt folks would be interested in this kind of scheme in India. I know people like *KNOW* them personally who easily have $5 million in corruption money and these are mid-level government officials in India. Given the size and scale of the Chinese economy and their power, I think they may have lesser corruption but the scale may be larger.
In any case, I am certain that bitstamp or any other bitcoin exchange would comply with government requests for information. As such it just seems like a very risky way to move your money out of China in this fashion, there must be other ways, shell companies, or whatever that are far more legal on paper.
But hey, it's a great theory, and I hope for the sake of bitcoin that it's not true :)

To be fair, comparing Bitpay to Western Union isn't accurate. WU is usually used to transfer money and not pay for goods. (it can be used for that but it's a minor use case..)
Comparing WU to Bitcoin on chain transactions might be a better metric, or even to bitcoin days destroyed. Of course, there's still a long way to go.
Don't let this sub get to you ;)

I am Indian and have used the Indian banking system extensively. It's not that easy to get a transfer reversed. There are several levels of verification that are required before you can do an NEFT or RTGS. Saying your account was hacked isn't going to fly that easily. In my experience Indian banks employ way stricter security systems (multifactor auth, etc.) more often than banks outside India.
Even a credit card chargeback is hard in India. I tried recently because I had some unauthorized charges from green peace. I gave up eventually and just let them keep the money. Wasn't a large amount, about $20.
Consumer protection is a joke in India and most people rely on the goodwill of the dealer (say you bought a damaged TV.. for example...). Chances of a bank transfer getting reversed without a serious investigation are slim.
Again, I am happy that these guys are offering this service. I don't think risk is the reason for the 3% markup. I believe it's just scarcity and lack of competition. Fair enough, let the free market work :)

Just want to add that it's not just cryptocurrency but *decentralized* cryptocurrency. That makes it quite revolutionary due to some hard problems that the protocol solves.
Also, we might have all still been on friendster if we'd have all paid for it. Network effects are very strong for money or paid stuff, if everyone's friend's paid for friendster and are on friendster and NOT moving to facebook (which is also paid), then everyone might come to friendster. Also friendster might have been hugely profitable and better if they made real money.. (not sure if they did or didn't though.. this part is just conjecture)
Of course, your point still stands and we'll see what the future holds.

That's a bit exaggerated. Bitcoin hasn't seen 50x swings in price even with it's given volatility. Secondly, accounts doesn't have to do anything to manage this. As far as the ledger's of businesses are concerned, they just paid back 5 cents of USD. It's transparently converted with a spot BTC exchange rate and the BTC is given to the user. They just don't have the problem of dealing with 'change' and the user gets his change in a digital format that he can spend anywhere (someday.. hopefully :P).
Nothing changes for accounts payable/receivable at all.
An analogy to this would be how you may travel to Europe and use your USD credit card for Euro purchases. You get the spot exchange rate and billed on your statement in USD. Nothing changes for the accounting guys at the merchant.

I heard about bitcoin first in early 2011 when a co-worker wanted to build a machine for mining. Was working as a programmer at a tech startup. He never built his machine. I never paid more attention.
Then, in late 2012 I decided to learn more about bitcoin. I started reading about it and got really into it. I wanted to buy some when the price was around $15 or so. But since I didn't live in the US/Europe, I didn't have many options. While I was trying to get setup the price started rising.. I was like "I gotta get some bitcoins somehow!!" so I started  - people send me their bitcoins, I buy them Amazon gift cards/send them Paypal money.
Got a few orders and kept all my bitcoins, they kept climbing to about $266.. or so and then BOOM! Gone. Down to $70. So now I was holding a ton of bitcoins but the value had crashed. It hurt having to fulfill people's orders, those who had bought at $250, but now knowing that if I were to cash out my BTC, I would just get 1/4th of the money. However, I wanted to build a reputation and honesty, trust, and good customer service are paramount. So I decided that I would keep running the site because people liked it and used it and that's a huge +1 for Bitcoin in general. I would hold the bitcoins and hopefully later sell at a profit.
I did sell some of them, and kept accumulating more (through $70, $120, $300, $500, $900, $1100, etc.) to sell later. So now the site is quite successful, we have great reviews and I have some ideas for the future. I have a 'long term stash' and a 'short term stash'. Yes, I have made some good money along the way (and lost some yesterday ;)) but I hope to build a sustainable bitcoin business eventually (cause this site will die the moment Amazon says yes to bitcoins, or Paypal gets pissed ;)), not necessarily this site, but something else maybe ?
My co worker who wanted to build a machine still doesn't have any BTC. He's now trying to open an account at Bitstamp. Hindsight's a bitch!
Well, that's the story so far :)

I'd just like to point out that the problem you mentioned regarding devs not agreeing on lowering the fee reminded me of the recent lockdown of the American government. Couldn't reach an agreement so... lights out.
With a decentralized system like bitcoin if push *really* came to shove, any developer or group of developers can fork the code and change it. As long as a majority of nodes accept that they want to run that fork, it's bitcoin 2.0 happening. Truly powerful democracy, so to speak.
Of course it's hard to say what would in fact happen in such a situation and I personally have great faith in the bitcoin devs but we do have a 'nuclear option' which centralized systems don't afford us.
I'm certain there are major challenges ahead of us, but with open source tech like bitcoin where potentially any developer in the world could jump in, I'm sure we can find solutions to even the toughest technical challenges. Heck, I'd love to contribute code to the core but I haven't understood it that well yet, not sure if I ever will, it's super impressive stuff!

I'd imagine that the value of used headphones or a used scooter would be far more arbitrary than the value of a popularly traded commodity/currency around the world (the value of which is readily available in realtime) ?

Plot twist. What if mtgox is stealing bitcoins from 'inactive' accounts and trading them out? Users think they got hacked or their details were stolen, clearly there is NO evidence of that in this case..

I'm really sorry about what happened to you. These are issues that we will face as a community as it grows and tries to find it's place in this world. Bitcoin has seen several scams so far and who knows how many more we will see ? It's not a perfect analogy but the people who found the new world (the Americas) had quite a bit of nasty shit happening at the time too.
The internet used to be a much more scary place back in the 90s too. Shopping carts were hacked all the time, credit card data stealing was a regular thing. That kind of stuff.
I'd say that Bitcoin's anonymity is a great feature. Of course, when it comes to establishing trust, anonymity is the first thing that has to go. There are systems that are trying to solve the problem of anonymous trust through some kind of address reputation but ultimately we're humans, not computers. When it comes to people each of us has many different shades. We can be totally trustworthy at one point of time and totally devious at another. That's why trust is so complicated in the world of 0s and 1s.
For now, trust services that are human, trust people who use their real names and business addresses. Use the same standard of trust that you would use for anything else, plus a bit more thrown in for caution.
The largest exchanges will not screw people over, they have much more to lose by doing that. Reputable bitcoin businesses will not try and run away with your money, they have much more to gain from being in it for the long haul.
We're on one of the first boats to America, it's exciting but there's anarchy out there. Things will get better with time though, as we build more solutions and find ways to manage these issues.

Had tried a $10k USD withdrawal in June. Waited 10 weeks with multiple back and forth with support. They kept saying 'We don't know when'.. Then finally offered the 5% fee option to me and said they would process it in 7 days...
Ended up going back into BTC and swore I would never use Gox again (lost about 10% due to price fluctuation). Held BTC and sold in the November price rise. Worked out okay for me. But fuck Gox. Seriously.

Well, yes. But it's hard to have both with something new like bitcoin. Who is trustworthy in a totally new realm that never existed before ? A lot of entrepreneurs who are jumping in don't really have a long track record of trustworthiness - does that mean we shouldn't trust them ?
At the end of the day I guess we would need to rely on some kind of superficial indicators like the ones you described (but possibly the internet equivalent of those) to understand who we can and cannot trust.
Neither can the handful of people who have proved trustworthy do everything themselves, a new financial system is a monumental effort by all means.
What I'm trying to think of is a standard for a trust system with bitcoin, we cannot always rely on escrow for something. Yet, even folks with good trust ratings on bitcointalk or otc end up doing strange things at times. I guess there is a ton of risk just as in with any other financial transaction. But coming up with a way to manage this risk without negatively affecting the protocol and it's features would definitely take this forward to the next level!

What's exactly even wrong with trying to get rich ? Do people honestly think that the folks who made Google, Amazon, Apple, etc. didn't do it at least in part to get rich ? Sure, there were other things at play but really.. ?
What's great about people getting into bitcoin to 'get rich quick' so to speak is this:
- They buy bitcoins
- They now want bitcoins to succeed
- So they evangelize
It's hard to make these arguments because of course most people look at bitcoin as money. But think about bitcoin as Intel stock.
Say you were a techie and were into computers big time and found out about this company Intel doing really cool stuff with microchips. You know that computers are the future and they're going to be used all over the world. You're old enough to buy Intel stock (I wasn't..) and you have some money for investing. Well, you'll buy Intel stock. But what else will you do ?
- You'll recommend Intel processors to people
- You'll talk about how great computers are and how they will change the world
- You'll *evangelize* for the digital generation.
- You'll hope that someday things work out and Intel goes big and you get rich too as a stock holder.
Did you buy Intel stock just to get rich ? Sure, but you did other things along the way.
As long as there are several thousand people (and there are..) *really* working on bitcoin problems, setting up bitcoin businesses, promoting bitcoin etc. it's okay to have other people who are in it 'just to get rich'. They may make some money (ultimately if bitcoin goes to $10k, only someone holding 100 BTC becomes a millionaire, most teenagers will just make a little bit of money if they put a few thousand into it right now..) but they also spread the word and get excited about stuff. Getting excited about stuff is great!

Same bank transfers would be an edge case. There is no shortage of banks in India, I wouldn't consider same bank transfers a significant contributor to this kind of risk management strategy.
However, if that was indeed the case I would still assume that the bank will take a deep look before they reverse the transaction. Same bank transfers are subject to the same kind of multifactor authentication as interbank transfers. They probably don't have the same volume restrictions though. (There's a cool off period of NEFTs after adding a beneficiary)
I don't see why you are addressing this from the viewpoint that the 'bank has little to lose' by reversing the transaction. Why? If its the same bank and no laws/legal investigation is involved then wouldn't the bank side with the bigger account which is likely to be the business account of a bitcoin seller? (You know big fish eat the little fish, etc..) In either way the burden of proof to get a transaction reversed would be on the buyer unless there's suspicion of unauthorized access. That's what makes these kinds of transfers better than say credit card or Paypal.
The only thing you can do without going through serious security are transfers between your own accounts in the same bank.

Even with their 50% loyalty discount you get stuck with 1.5%. Come on guys, this is ridiculous. Lower operating costs and higher fees ?
I do understand ditching INR for Bitcoin though, the rupee has been performing very poorly for the past 2 years. Bitcoin on the other hand has been awesome.

Cashing out a million in $50k increments from Bitstamp shouldn't be a problem.

Sorry for the delay with your order. We've been receiving a high volume of orders due to the sudden growth of interest in Bitcoins. I've just shipped your order. Could you please confirm that you've received your amazon gift card ?

This is one of the prime benefits that bitcoin offers merchants. Every CC transaction for smaller merchants costs up to 3%. Micropayments are even worse!
I work with Paypal for micropayment rates (their micropayment rates are very competitive .. right now..). For every $2 payment, I get just $1.83. That works out to 8.5%!

Ideally the deflation is bitcoin value plus an increase in miner's fees due to a huge increase in transaction counts should make this a profitable business venture.
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:55:38
Yup! That's the guy! Unfortunately, I had no way of knowing that before I started using it. It was one of the 'bigger bitcoin exchanges'.

I run  - we convert from bitcoin to Paypal. Check it out :)

I honestly think you're wrong. When I referred to 'we' as a community I wasn't talking about those who are screwing over others or day trading to make millions while exchanges go down and values fluctuate insanely. (I have nothing against day trading by the way.. I just wasn't referring to them..)
I was talking about the people who have the ideals for a global decentralized currency. The ideals that some of us think stand behind bitcoin.
You know what happens when things go mainstream ? The signal gets lost in the noise. This happened to music, it happened to movies, it happened to reddit, it happened to hackernews and it happened to bitcointalk as well.
That doesn't mean that there aren't several of us, many who personally know each other, working to make bitcoin the currency of the future. It's not all perfect either. We do want to make a huge impact and hopefully get rich too. 
I'm not saying this is charity, but we don't want to get there by screwing people either. You may ask me who this 'we' are, and I'm not going to name names/handles/people, but there are a bunch of people who are trying to make this work all over the world. There are a bunch of people who think that bitcoin can help solve a lot of the world's problems. I certainly am one of them. Maybe you want to get to know me and join us. Maybe you don't.
Trust is one of the issues that some of us are trying to solve. How do you trust someone who you just met online ? Or how can we give you the right tools to make that decision ? Yes, OTC is a good idea but it's too raw. We need something more powerful to attach to the bitcoin network. You can always choose to stay anonymous for transactions that require it and reveal yourself for others. These are amongst the problems that 'we' are trying to solve.
Of course things get much more rotten once big money gets involved and yes, some big money has got involved with bitcoin. Ultimately the rich and powerful want to seize control in all the domains they can, everyone knows that and bitcoin is no different. We're not a roving tribe, you're right, but some of us are trying to evangelize for this new technology that will hopefully change the way money works. I'm skeptical too, but it's important to dream that things are possible.
EDIT: I also want to add that there are some metrics that must be used when deciding to trust a business. Forget about OTC, WOT and all this stuff. What about the identity of the person you are trusting your bitcoins to ? You need to at the very least have a domain with a person on it. Look at this:  or  (both are set to private registration, both bitcoin businesses - one is believed to be a scammer right now) vs.  (financial business, has contact info).
We need some simple metrics to decide whether we can trust a business or not. I realized today that bitstamp does not even have a phone number on their site. That is unacceptable. I don't think they are scam, but during the last two days they have been quiet. They definitely owe their paying customers a way that they can be contacted. Maybe, again 'we' as a community need to ask for more. &lt;/rant&gt;

It won't be. The reason Paypal didn't like bitcoin trading is because of chargebacks. The issue was with BUYING bitcoins using Paypal.
What would happen is that someone would use a stolen paypal account to buy bitcoins. Then run off with those coins. Since bitcoin transactions are pretty much irreversible, Paypal would end up then doing a chargeback to the seller. This increased greatly the number of chargebacks.
What we're doing here is the opposite of that, so no issues of chargebacks. Hopefully it'll be fine :)

You know your post gave me a thought, when you said people might not want to convert fiat. What if merchant's started giving change in bitcoin ?
Say you paid $10 for an item that $9.95. What if the 5 cents you get back actually show up in bitcoin ? Now bitcoin is your change but it's also like cash back. It certainly solves the problem of merchant's having to keep change handy or give out candy or some kind of voucher. (7/11 has some voucher system like stamps..)
Solves a few problems:
- Merchant's don't need to keep change
- Customer's don't need pesky coins in their pockets
- Customer's don't need to accept non-money like stamps (that can only work at a particular establishment) or candy
- Their change is deflationary and actually appreciates in purchasing power
- More people get bitcoins..
Ooh is this a startup idea ? :O

Thanks! Well, you basically spend $98 and get a $100 amazon gift card. We're using some creative ways to get discounts from amazon and then passing them on to you.
My main concern is to get more people to use bitcoin and ideally I'd just like merchants to accept bitcoin but until that happens, we'll bridge the gap somehow.
The reason I came up with the Paypal idea is because one of our buyers asked for an eBay gift card (we didn't offer those..). I tried sending him one but eBay declined the transaction. That's when I thought Paypal -&gt; eBay is almost the same thing. Hence the idea :)
@_date: 2013-03-28 07:43:31
Yeah, I think what's most important right now is to have more places where people can SPEND bitcoins. A stagnant bitcoin economy will not really help much. I'm looking forward to the day that Amazon starts accepting bitcoins :)

This discussion is interesting. This kind of contract would be fairly easy to enforce in the same way.
Say I lend you 100BTC for something. I publicly declare that my bitcoin address 'AABBCC' is lending your bitcoin address 'DDEEFF' 100BTC under some terms. If this was drawn up as a contract, in the same way as fiat, you already have a legally enforceable agreement. If it says you as a person have to return 110BTC at the end, then if you don't, assets equivalent to that amount could be seized, etc. (the same price mechanism can be applied to determine what amount of assets equal 110BTC at the time)
The main issue with deflationary currency like BTC is that when I lent you 100BTC if it equaled $100,000, then maybe by the time you return it, it may equal $150,000. Now, I'm not sure if that's because the dollar inflated in the meanwhile or BTC deflated. But it's a problem I can't find the answer to.
The main sacrifice in the above scenario is anonymity but I don't think you'd be loaning money anonymously anyway.

I was talking of managing trust through software being a challenge. Or trusting people over the Internet. Anyone is trustworthy until they're not. Or someone isn't trustworthy until they are and then will be trustworthy until they are not. It's not easy to map human behavior into software, so an automated trust system is very challenging to implement.
Yes, people are greedy and self centered but that kind of behavior isn't limited to bitcoin.

Been waiting for verification for 2 days now. Bitstamp took just under a day. So.. waiting to test drive this baby!

I started using bitcoin-24. Deposited 7 BTC and they went down. Now my 7 BTC is stuck until god knows when, or gone forever.
At least with gox, that's less likely.. *sigh* :(
@_date: 2013-09-13 12:46:47
I've got an mtgox USD withdrawal stuck in there for 7+ weeks now. They offered to do a 5% fee (INSANELY HIGH) and do it within 7 days but I declined.
Still waiting for them to get it out so yeah the two weeks/few weeks thing is a total lie.

I see, well you seem to have a lot of knowledge about this stuff, I had no idea it was so hard to move cash out of China and that the Chinese would resort to such moves. (price differences were crazy today, China was at $1200 and bitstamp was at $600, that's a 50% loss!)
So BTC would only be used for legal money due to the paper trail as far as I understand. I would've thought that the wealthy Chinese would have swiss bank accounts by now anyway ;)

Wait for 3 confirms and it should show up. If not, get in touch with support.
It should show up in a few minutes, especially if you paid a small transaction fee.

Excellent point. Does the answer also depend on whether people know who you are vs you being anonymous? The difference between no one knowing your real identity and you running away with a million dollars vs everyone knowing exactly who you are is huge IMO.
A better analogy would be that you have this bag of $1MM. The money in the bag belongs to the people who are sitting around you. No one knows your real name or what you look like (you're wearing shades and a hat). Now you run away with the bag.
The above situation is different from everyone knowing your name, face, and address. Running away with $1MM is a huge crime and people whose identities are known are less likely to do it. Bitcoin can stay anonymous but bitcoin businesses should reveal themselves, just as any other business does.

Great stuff! Looking forward to coin4ce and some stellar bitcoin growth in Latin America!

Here's what happens. There's a huge spread between people buying and selling. Buyers know that this is their opportunity so they place buy orders about $50-$100 below the last price. Most sellers aren't selling so cheap, so if you look at the order book you'll see that there are very few bitcoins available.
However, the occasional panic seller shows up and unloads BTC using an Instant Order. What happens then is that bitstamp matches it to the top buy orders. This changes the 'last price' to $50 below market value or even $100 at times.
Then, the market is quiet until another fool rolls along. This continues for a while but this is what causes those dramatic drops and the subsequent bounce back.
TLDR; Panic instant sell orders causing massive bounces in the market. Market activity is low apart from those instances.
