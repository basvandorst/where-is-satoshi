Okay i just read your mission statement on your website. And it sounds good(legit which is very important to me) to know that it works primarily through the breadapp. I am in the Washington DC area and i would be very interested in marketing for this. I will spend the rest of the night studying the practicalities of it. And the cards are also a great incentive to getting other people to sign up! I like this I’m surprised i never heard of it! It’s a simple step by step process to signing up for crypto and I’m sure people will appreciate the gift aspect as well!
