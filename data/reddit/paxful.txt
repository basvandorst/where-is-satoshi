Paxful is a part of the peer to peer bitcoin trading movement yes.
There is natural overlap between us and other escrow services. Our focus is on first time buyers and whitehat trading. We have streamlined the UI/UX to make it as simple as possible and to give the friendliest possible face to Bitcoin. We take our customer support seriously and are actually listening to the trading community. Everything they have been asking for the past two years we will be giving them.
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:50:38
their algorithms do need work but the core structure of the system is time tested for over 20 years. That is hard to beat and makes for a good foundation. We learn from the best.
@_date: 2015-06-17 05:29:00
I see you are expressing real concerns. Other visitors of our website have sometimes same questions too.
First currently all our sellers are experienced and approved sellers by us. So we ensure that there are no scams coming from seller side. Also we and sellers are protecting themselves from scammers to.

We developed  which is direct competitor to localbitcoins and any other escrow service.
It took us 3 guys 6-8 months working 7 days a week 10+ hours a day to develop it (yes it was so exciting). Moreover all of us have at least 5 years of development experience including finacial software.  
Of course initially we planned to complete it in 2-3 months but as it usually is with estimations for software project, to get realistic estimations you have to multiply it with Tambov constant :)
Before I'll break down to you what kind of components need to be there let me say that we have all functionality that localbitcoins has plus some extra functionality (biggest is system wide private messaging for users). Also our UI and UX approach is completely different and tailored for mainstream and first time bitcoin buyers.
Here is what needs to be done
* Bitcoin web wallet. Important parts are: generate bitcoin addresses for users, send out payments, receive payments and confirm transaction after `n` confirmations. All at the same time properly handle users balances.
* Create offers/ads. When you have basic flow of users bitcoin wallets in hand, it's time to move into marketplace part. First part is the offer creation. What are the rules here like hard-coded payment methods (we went step further and allow users to dynamically create new payment methods), payment window time, BTC price margin, offer visiblity to users? etc etc... Additionally have all the CRUD (create,read,update,delete) operations for the offer and all the business logic like updating price every 10 minutes, activation, deactivation etc...
* Now comes the trading part - start trade, mark trade as paid, complete trade, auto-cancel trade, cancel trade by user, dispute trade, leave feedback. For all these trade actions the business logic has to be extremely well thought through and code written well with all edge cases taken into account. Otherwise you can end up with adding balance twice, deleting accidently records or simply break database schema.
* Trade live chat - Not a small part, considering that you need file upload here, moderator messages in case of dispute and anything else you see there.
* Feedback system is another part. Would you make it different? How complex would that be then? We have different feedback approach - feedback can be left for every completed trade and also a reply can be left. In case dispute a loser can't leave feedback.
* Reporting capabilities for any historical data/actions - users completed trades, activity ledger, transactions ledger, generated bitcoin addresses and any other historical data you need to output.
* Backend admin for website health - bitcoin balance in bitcoin cores, users balances, active trades, history, anything you can think of you want to see in real time.
All these above points are only specifically about bitcoin peer to peer marketplace. I'm not mentioning anything about proper enterprise software plus secure website development - unit tests, replication, disaster recovery, build automation, backups, validations, protection against all kinds of website attacks and so on. And for last not least is knowing how to develop applications where you are dealing with financial data and user balances where knowing how to write transaction SQL queries is important so malicious users couldn't double spend for example with race conditions that has happened in multiple bitcoin exchanges :)  
We have very little bit of tips on our blog about it 
If you really want to develop long lasting similar project I recommend you to choose as your IT partner somebody who has done similar project before so they can estimate better and wouldn't make any rookie mistakes.
I would say this project price is close to $100k.
One of our developers has software development company and may be interested to work if your project won't overlap with Paxful. If you would like a more exact pricing quote please go to his software dev company website

Bitquick.co should be given respect for their positive contribution to the peer to peer eco system. They have taken great pains to streamline the buyer purchase process and this is good for everyone. As one of the standout Boost Tribe 5 startups they really proved themselves to be committed and quality players. They deserve encouragement and support.
We at Paxful are also committed to lifting all boats and we know the peer to peer economy is the key.

Paxful is a new peer to peer exchange currently in Alpha. Our mission is to create the safest possible environment for trading. We want only good actors and to keep everything whitehat, while giving people the flexibility to use any payment method and create new ones.
It's a complex balance to give newbie buyers the simplest most streamlined experience and to give pro traders the most flexible tools but we are taking input from everyone and are dedicated to giving the people everything they have been asking for.
Together we can build the On Demand Bitcoin market of the future

On  we have a seller from Greece. Feel free to contact him
He has paypal offer now, but he can enable SEPA again or you could even arrange a meeting with him. Just open up a trade with him and you will be in live chat with him
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:08:56
Awesome idea.
We have several sellers on Paxful now who are selling small and big amounts for PayPal.
Aussie Trader and Paybis are legit and sell bitcoins after id is provided. The coins are in escrow so it is quite safe. This is the only way we know of other than your idea to buy bitcoin with paypal.
good luck

you were reading the TL;DR actually We put it at the beginning trying to do the very best reddit etiquette we can.
@_date: 2015-06-17 05:22:01


It's when one block is found and right away next block, with only coinbase transaction. That means you will get 2 blocknotifies almost same time. So during first blocknotify your script updates your unconfirmed transactions and at the same time your script for second blocknotify updates same unconfirmed transactions. While the first script is still executing and your transaction isolation level is probably default `read commited` your second script still sees unconfirmed transactions like they were before your first script started to run. I hope you get the point why you should execute that script synchronously.
Legal side of operating p2p marketplace is another post that will come from us soon :)
Feel free to join our marketplace. Anybody can join and buy bitcoins, but creating a sell offer is only for experienced online sellers. If anybody is wants early access to create sell offer and get pioneer seller badge, please let us know 
@_date: 2015-06-29 22:38:51
Thanks for reply. Agree that queueing transactions with separate process is the way to go. You could add additional business rules like autoconfirm withdrawal for user if amount is small and enable manual withdrawal if amount withdrawn for example during `n` hours exceeds `n` BTC.
All major bitcoin exchanges actually work this way now - on withdrawal you get email notification that withdrawal process started and then second email that withdrawal is completed and bitcoins sent to the network.
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:47:05
What extra checks would you add?
What about having 2 withdrawals at the same moment?
Say you have 300 BTC. While first withdrawal of 100 BTC transaction is in progress and these 100 bitcoins were sent out already to network but transaction wasn't yet commited. Here comes second transaction at the same moment which reads a balance state that is BEFORE the first transaction started which is 300 BTC, not 200 BTC as you assume. Because standard `read commited` will not do `dirty read` which is state of uncommited transactions, because that first withdrawal may fail and that's why database assumes only to read verified states.
Of course there are ways still to use `read committed` with extra settings, like on DB level use `SELECT .. FOR UPDATE` or `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level. And on application level use locks, queues, synchronized methods/objects

Think back to 2011.. when hardly anyone had heard of bitcoin... one guy decided to put up three sites to help the community at his own cost of money and time.
We should all be thankful for the people that poured a lot of blood and sweat into the bitcoin ecosystem, especially when it was nearly nothing. None of us would be here without their efforts. We're a peer to peer marketplace so we love the concept of democratic technology, much like bitcoin itself, but lets be thankful and recognize the people who did the work, and it when it wasn't "sexy". Thank You

@_date: 2015-06-30 20:18:38
We have a few traders from Greece on our marketplace and they are not reporting a big increase in sales. The problem is as Andreas has stated, Most did not have a lot of cash in hand before and those that do don't really need bitcoin because they must spend that cash locally. 
Hopefully this will be a warm introduction to bitcoin for Greece :)

Why not **host your own**?
We had this same issue last year. 
Eventually we decided to write our own API server implementation around bitcoin core. 
Far more than a wrapper it is a full server with logging database. One Ezbit server can host multiple accounts.
It is written in the best php framework, Laravel and uses Postgres, but it can be adapted for mysql pretty easily.
It runs completely on your own server and uses no 3rd party components. Yours and yours alone. Plus we document the install step by step and even walk you through installing bitcoin core and best practices for updating and maintaining it.
It is open source, give it a shot. We support it all the way.

Please read this when you are developing financial/bitcoin software. Our dev has mentioned here about approaches for thread synchronizations/race conditions avoidance, proper transaction isolations.
Also keep in mind that for example PostgreSQL default `read commited` isolation will wreak havoc in your system.

We built this merchant Point of Sale especially for brick and mortar business. 
We support CAD and all currencies.
It is a super simple web app that works on any smart phone or tablet. supports multiple taxes and multiple items. 
just enough to be as simple as possible and satisfy merchants needs. We built it for a few Nyc restaurants like this one.

You can easily find here bitcoin sellers who sell bitcoin with debit/credit through various 3rd party payment processors like gyft.com
Depends on the quantity you need, with debit/credit you can easily purchase up to $50 worth of bitcoin and get bitcoins under 5 minutes.

Sorry for your trouble.
LBC isn't perfect but in their defense dealing with scammers ad fraud is an immense challenge, one we are beginning to see in it's full breadth. Not making any excuses for their actions or anyone else just stating that we are all still learning.  LBC allows anyone to sell outside their system which means that some buyers could have been scammed outside of escrow hence their strong stance here. It is understandable to protect their buyers.
We verify all our vendors and while we do not encourage trading outside of escrow but certainly would not ban for it. It is a difference of game mechanics. We are looking for feedback form all pro traders and welcome your advice. 
-Feedback system
-Recommended confirmations count. ours is currently 3
-Scam prevention
Anything you can think of. We are certainly not perfect and just publicly launched a few days ago but we are open for any and all feedback.Currently paxful does online trades only and the focus is on helping onboard complete newbies into bitcoin. Please see The BackPage Effect video for an idea of what we work with. 
The space is just now really taking shape and there is room for many more players each with their own niche and feature sets. Working together we can bring good change to the scene and lift all boats. Welcome.

@_date: 2015-08-10 21:44:36
it is 
Running any peer to peer marketplace is tough. Scammers are everywhere and the scene is wild. Anyone who takes this on deserves respect. We at Paxful make it a policy to stamp out scammers but we also don't ever hold anyone's funds. If there is clear evidence of a scam then our arbitrators will award the victim. This is a murky area and we should all work together to clean up the scene. Localbitcoins has done a lot of good and shown us all how viable p2p really is. Now it is up to all of us to take it all to the next level as a community. This will be how the world gets its bitcoins.

Bitcoin is kind of like email in 1992 now.  Imagine typing in http commands into a telnet client...
Getting it is tough and using it is just as tough if not tougher for the average person. Most people need it fast and that means a peer to peer trade, pretty daunting for a first timer. It is getting better and many of them are figuring it out. We especially in the USA have been trained to feed digits to a machine our whole life and now things have changed and we must actually deal with humans and instead of letting people take from us we must send to them in a secure fashion...
We are getting there and the great news is all the amazing bitcoin ambassadors out there who are taking their time and energy to educate a whole new generation of users.
Slowly but surely we are getting it! Thanks to everyone here.

thank you for looking out. helps us focus on the work at hand, like helping people. it will soon come to light who is behind this troll army if they don't cool it.
@_date: 2015-08-31 21:19:44
thank you :)
@_date: 2015-07-21 22:02:37
yes, this is our company account. we post about Paxful.
Our how-to guides, open source projects , videos and community out reach.
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:59:22
we will be putting out a video soon. we didn't want to eat up time from support and dev but it seems it must be done as many have asked to see "proof" i hope we can count on your amazing support!

Hi, we posted this saturday night, a day before their own.
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:14:34
Closing the circle.... =)
@_date: 2015-08-10 01:43:14
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:10:14
we understand... it really opened our eyes as to just how far we have yet to go...
but the GREAT news is that now we know exactly what needs to be done to fix it. Expect a lot more news from Paxful as we work to take bitcoin mainstream.
@_date: 2015-08-31 21:07:31
Coin lists has some very high quality articles and is made with love. Folks like this supporting the entire eco system are the reason bitcoin will succeed in a huge way.
@_date: 2015-08-10 17:07:11
We have been doing quite a bit of phone support for bit quick users, they call us angry thinking "bitcoin" is all the same company.  
Will send you some of their feedback or should we post the video here first?  Should help you fix things up bit and lower our phone support load.
@_date: 2015-08-21 23:36:11
thank you, we wish we had time for better videos but we need to focus on support and product. IT was worth it getting it out there and we will be doing more videos soon, nothing fancy just enough to share.
@_date: 2015-07-20 03:31:32
we posted this at the top but others cannot see it..
A very fair narrative, thank you for this. 
You took a lot of risk and your time helping people get bitcoin and we saw how you went out of your way to help them out and answer basic questions and give them awesome support. Thank you for this, you're a real warrior for bitcoin. It's always the good guys that get burned hardest :(
We have made several big mistakes here.
1. While we did ask for "EXPERIENCED traders please! " We still manually gave authorization for you to trade. We should have better checked experience or at the very least have given each trader a Scam Prevention Guidebook for each of the payment methods we were accepting. No such guidebook exists now, but it should and it will!
2. We should have worked faster on getting more experienced sellers for small amounts in while the lull was in effect, this way we wouldn't have freaked out when The back pagers started coming in again. We thought we had a week or two at least, not two days and spent it recovering and planning, when we should have continued to work.
3. Even though we setup a slack.paxful.com chat room for all pro traders we should have been much more proactive in inviting each of the new traders there for a how to trade crash course. If we had taken a little time to draw upon the immense knowledge base of our pro traders they would have easily told the burned trader that big amounts in gift cards  twice in a row with a smaller amount first was a bad sign. This was a big mistake on our part!
4. In trying to build the "white hat" peer to peer network to help the people get bitcoin we did not take seller security seriously enough. While we listen to our pro traders and have been working non stop to give them the features they have been asking for like 2FA on everything, Clef 2FA and instant messaging coming soon, we did not yet plan out any kind of auto scam detection systems like for example. flagging a buyer who uses a very high risk payment method twice in a row with the same trader and high amounts. This is a big project for the future, the very near future.
Ok so enough beating up on ourselves, what can we do right now to fix this?
1. We're going to invite any traders we missed to our Slack chat and start conversations about the risks of each payment method
2. We're going to write up a blog posts about everything we have learned so far about the riskiest payment methods with tips to prevent scams and what to watch for.
3. We're going to send out an email to all of our verified sellers about the above posts and the slack chat.
4. All new sellers will be linked to the above resources before being allowed to make offers.
The above are all just bare basic methods to try and raise our defenses. The real work will be listening to the pro traders and implementing what they are asking for from their vast experience. We got so tied up in helping out our newbie buyers and streamlining things that we completely overlooked this vital element of the business. 
Tomorrow, Monday, is going to be CRAZY and it only gets more intense towards Thursday, as the first BackPage ripple taught us. We will be working our best deliver on every side of the fence. Please be patient with us, as we are just a two man full-time, overtime team and we can barely keep up.
@_date: 2015-07-20 06:38:43
we recommend AirBitz to our newbie backpage users. It started off rough and is now one of the easiest and best bitcoin wallets. check it out!
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:56:31
Check out 
We are safe peer to peer exchange where you buy bitcoin direct from other people. They don't want your bank account and send you bitcoin fast. We verify each of our sellers so our service is safe and secure. On Paxful you can buy bitcoin with Paypal 
Cash Deposit, Western Union, Gift cards etc..
Welcome. We also give 1 on 1 support via live chat. When you start a trade with a seller you will be in an instant live chat with them and they will walk you through the rest.
@_date: 2015-07-18 13:28:59
they want small alts $5-$20
western union and bank cash deposit are too much hassle for sellers to process. we have several that will take gift cards for high margins.
please suggest something better for small amounts good for both parties. it would really help. buyers don't care, just has to be fast and easy
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:27:04
thank you, welcome to the family
@_date: 2015-07-18 04:19:10
Paxful is a place for WHITE hat safe and secure trades. These are normal people who want to buy their first bitcoins for $10-$20.
If you know of another way to do that please suggest something better. Traders are not going to run out to western union for $20 and they don't bother with $10 bank deposits.
There is plenty of fraud and scams in the bitcoin space but NOT at paxful. Paxful is a clean and safe easy to use place for normal folks to buy bitcoin from other people directly. Please put yourself in the place of the average non tech person. None of our sellers have gotten scammed for gift cards because we only send them legitimate normal people. 
As for why they don't use other services... the answer is pretty clear.
@_date: 2015-07-14 01:13:17
where are you? what city?
 we are thinking of ways to make this as grass roots as possible so moderators could help guide people. Our chat system is in the works but not ready yet.. hmm
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:26:38
right sorry!
@_date: 2015-07-20 05:16:44
thank you so much for understanding.
We've made mistakes and will continue to do so but our hearts are in the right place, that's worth something. 
love this community!
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:27:56
It is only just entering the hockey stick phase now.
@_date: 2015-08-21 22:07:53
that is awesome thank you. we are trying to figure out how to crowdsource this phone support. it is very sensitive.
@_date: 2015-07-11 01:05:02
Currently our paxful wallet doesn't charge them any fees. we explain to them that they can install a phone wallet. We recommend Airbitz, Bread Wallet and mycelium on android etc. 
We are working on a pro level how to guide for them from all the info we've gotten.
@_date: 2015-08-30 08:51:07
Thank you.
We have many sellers who will take your One Vanilla card and give you bitcoin. You can always find one who will do this trade. They handle thousands of these trades so you are in good hands. All our sellers are verified.
This link will give you a list of all vendors accepting your card. Just start a trade, upload what they ask and you have instant bitcoin.
Good luck :)
@_date: 2015-07-22 01:43:45
Thank you! wait till you see the videos!
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:12:34
they are super easy. issue is the time. first time they need it fast, 5 days is a huge deal breaker.
@_date: 2015-07-18 18:30:32
We've been building, writing and filming for over a year and a half. We believe in bitcoin and everything we do is to make our collective vision of a better world a reality. We've put out an open source bitcoin server , one which we use.  We've made several videos promoting bitcoin here in NYC.    We also keep a blog at http:blog.paxful.com and put some real research into our articles.














@_date: 2015-07-11 22:11:03
we always used highest priority because people want their bitcoins fast. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:47:34
thanks.. we think.
ads still cost to be boosted to the top
@_date: 2015-07-18 04:47:10
We prefer NOT to hold onto people coins, sellers and buyers. We suggest all buyers move their coins onto app wallets and suggest AirBitz, Bread and Mycelium. We ask sellers only put their minimum balances needs for escrow and move their coins off when they are not active. We haven't even publicly launched yet. This is all a beta run for feedback. Boy are we getting it.
@_date: 2015-07-06 07:21:17
yes, exactly.
We see huge potential for this and so do the pro traders. They have been asking for so much for so long and there is a reason for it. This entire facet of the eco system has mega potential. It is up to all of us to jump into this and really take bitcoin to the mainstream. This is how we do it, with good honest, grass roots business. kind of like buying from your local farmers markets instead of walmart.
@_date: 2015-07-14 19:15:29
we don't know about Gyft but we do warn our sellers about Paypal.
One of our sellers was hit with a paypal scammer. we helped him prevent Paypal with evidence that he fulfilled all orders and the scammer dropped his reversals. We stick with our pro traders and go the distance to protect them. any scammers founds are marked as such internally and all traders see it, that way they continue trying to scam and getting rejected every time.
@_date: 2015-08-10 00:40:32
thank you, from the heart. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 01:45:01
we are online only. more global than local.
We verify our sellers and are really locking it down to only have the most experienced ones. These are the cream of the crop of pro traders and won't do anything to ruin their reputation.
We're still in beta and have been trying to stay low key while we optimize everything. We got caught totally off guard with this whole BackPage Effect but we're trying our best to make it work.
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:49:06
the act of first sending out the bitcoin from their paxful wallet to their cellphone wallet still had to be overcome. which was just the same ant of work. also many of them were android users and had never downloaded an app before. we tried this a few times and it took at least 10 minutes to walk them through installing and setting up a wallet. it only added to the complexity of an already very frustrated user.
We do encourage users to download wallets and use them so they "have" all their own bitcoin but walking them through that for their first effort proved to be too much.
@_date: 2015-07-11 01:47:04
We have set up highest priority transaction fee when sending out transaction to bitcoin network. So all transactions are geting confirmed in next block.
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:16:37
we are a peer to peer marketplace. we list buy and sell ads for bitcoin. people can buy and sell bitcoins using any payment method in any currency. We also have an escrow service to assist.
We tailor our platform for new buyers and offer support to everyone. We are online only now. This is how the world will get it's bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-15 03:28:19
His average sales are $10. not much worry as far as aml goes...
If you can get small amounts of bitcoin to people for less please join us and we will happily send you people.
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:27:54
Hi, thanks. 
We just started helping people and taking calls. Walking them through step by step. Word just got out about it and all of a sudden we even got calls from people who never had been to the website. They just started passing around our number telling their friends that these guys were patient and helpful. We even reached out to their support to help broken sends and gave suggestions to improve their flow and conversions.
Next thing you know backpage is cc'ing us on support and we're talking to them directly. They send out a huge email blast with us at the top and listed us at the top of their page.
When you take the time to help people word just gets out. We're no marketing geniuses here, just developers. We wouldn't know what marketing was if it bit us on the butt. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:14:21
yes info first register and then give us your username and any other trading profiles you have. we will import your history feedback etc....
@_date: 2015-07-31 16:08:26
yes, will be awhile before we get to this point.  We are all studying and learning and hope to do even better next time.
@_date: 2015-07-29 02:47:54
CLEF gives security minded startups every reason to integrate. Quality speaks for itself.
@_date: 2015-07-20 05:39:22
will research! Thank you for always being ahead of the curve Mark
@_date: 2015-07-18 03:13:36
our experienced sellers know how to handle themselves and what to ask for. paypal is very risky tho
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:20:15
Strong work. 
This has been needed for quite a while. 
We will link to this on our blog.paxful.com and in our faqs on 
Paxful is a peer to peer bitcoin marketplace where you can buy bitcoin direct from sellers and sell also. We built it because we noticed the current peer to peer alternatives were far to complex and the tools available to sellers were not properly protecting them from fraud.
@_date: 2015-07-22 00:20:07
very true, we optimized it for folks on mobile. no excuse tho. we will redo this asap. anything else?
@_date: 2015-07-18 03:18:33
thanks we are on it, would have posted earlier but we got flooded!
@_date: 2015-07-11 21:52:00
great questions!
On phone all morning after 3 hrs sleep so gotta keep it short.
The fact that you buy from other people direct is what most don;t get at first, we are so used to interacting with big corporations and just giving them our numbers....
The whole peer to peer trade flow is broken right now. we are completely overhauling it with all the amazing feedback we got from doing customer support.
Our CEO has been on the phones for 3 straight days and has been scribbling diagrams and flow charts everywhere. We should really help improve the rate that people "get it" after this next big update, we will publish a FULL guide on HOW we did this, just like we did with how we built the market in the first place.
@_date: 2015-07-31 01:41:15
Pax means "peace" in Latin, Paxful = Peaceful.
Our founders chose it because we all think bitcoin can lead to a more peaceful world. Our ultimate mission is to help build a more peaceful world and we know bitcoin is the answer. 
Paxful is a peer to peer money marketplace. We give people a way to trade value across currencies, payment methods and borders using bitcoin as the medium of exchange. We are still in open beta and hope to launch soon. 
We wanted to stay in stealth just getting feedback but when the BackPage effect hit we just started answering the phone to help people and it all just started to take on a life of it's own.
@_date: 2015-07-20 08:29:37
we love u bro
@_date: 2015-07-20 05:39:01
you rock! we'd love to get help with this once we publicly launch!
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:52:44
These guys are doing amazing work! 
Bitcoin education just graduated! Thank real grass roots efforts like this for taking bitcoin mainstream.
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:28:58
We do not sell bitcoin. The trader now doing all the gift card deals has excellent feedback and goes the distance to help people.
We don't spend 20 hours a day walking raw newbies thru buying and using their first bitcoin for nothing. We're here to bring bitcoin to the mainstream. Traders like Tolan are doing us all a huge favor handling these $5-$20 orders
@_date: 2015-07-12 06:22:59
sure is!
with peer to peer markets like paxful you can make a profit converting bitcoins back to dollars as well.
You can become a seller on Paxful and help people get bitcoin too!  We do have a strict seller verification process to join Paxful but it is worth it as helping people get bitcoin is rewarding in all ways and the community of Pro traders we have is just an awesome group.
@_date: 2015-07-19 05:29:46


















@_date: 2015-08-24 05:44:41
We are open for interviews and have a lot more to share. Has been an amazing month. we just launched a few days ago and will be working to onboard more mainstream bitcoin buyers.
@_date: 2015-07-18 18:23:14
you need to talk on the phone with one of these folks then you will understand...
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:50:12
Absolutely. We have all learned a tremendous amount.
We cannot over state how important it is for us to listen to the average user. The total newbie non techie who tries to buy and use bitcoin for the first time. We spoke with them on the phone for almost a week non stop 24 hrs a day and what we learned MADE us pay attention and rethink our whole process.
This whole event should be a huge wakeup call to the entire community to reprioritize. We want Bitcoin to become mainstream then we must first put ourselves in their position and see through their eyes. Every little thing we learned we put back into the product and we magically saw the pain points vanish. 
It wasn't magic through, just something none of this we ever have to do, listen to the raw, non crypto newbies. The bitcoin world is full of intellectual giants and developers at the very edge of technical innovation all working to prepare bitcoin for the day when it can replace the current financial networks. This will happen but not without the connection to the masses.
The "freelancing class" of backpage is the key to this as they are motivated and their non technical backgrounds are a benefit to us here as they show us exactly what the average person will see. This past five days has been a window into the future that bitcoin has needed and we jumped right into it.
Big things are coming from bitcoin. Paxful will be doing our part by building the small pretty things we need to make this happen. No fancy bitcoin 2.0 stuff from us we'll be working more on Bitcoin 0.1 fundamentals and widgets to make this whole process work like butter.
We are so thankful for all the amazing help we got, all the people we spoke too and their amazing patience. Thank you reddit! this has been inspiring.
oh yeah we got some sleep too.a
@_date: 2015-08-10 17:47:21
it's ok, we are not marketing guys, we realize getting out first can be important but we are more focused on product and helping our customers. When I finished the post saturday night we got hit with a flood of support and had to wait till sunday to post and edit a bit more.
@_date: 2015-07-25 18:18:56
we're not into flame wars. we just want to focus on the positive and helping people. hopefully this person lays off and focuses on their product instead.
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:07:07
No, but you can buy with a walmart, target, amazon, best buy or gamester gift card.
This trader will sell you bitcoin for gift cards like target.
Register and get a free wallet
click here 
type in the amount, for example 25$ and click "start trade now” 
type in a message and click "send message" wait for the seller to respond with instructions
Sellers do not accept debit cards, or prepaid credit cards because they can get charged back and scammed. Only a few take debit but they charge big fees! like double.
@_date: 2015-07-11 01:06:36
we are all doing it, one person at a time. Bitcoin will be remembered as the greatest grass roots campaign in human history.
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:40:42
99.9% of Paxful trades are online.
@_date: 2015-07-22 09:13:12
we tell them to keep their bitcoins on a phone wallet as we don't want the liability of holding onto their btc. we do this for the ones that show a lot of learning ambition. most are just so excited that they managed to get a trade going and send bitcoin that they are too exhausted to learn anything else. this will change soon tho!
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:47:16
Yes, that's more than enough. Also as a proof that it's really you just put extra character which we tell in your description there.
@_date: 2015-07-21 00:03:52
We are a website that lists buyers and sellers of bitcoin and lately we have been hit with a wave of newbies. As in people who are not so tech savvy (some are very tech savvy however) They are pretty awesome but our young intern who took the full brunt of it all just got kind of exhausted and had enough for a while from all the chat support she had to do.
We need a new intern in NYC, male or female is good.
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:22:11
Our Amazon Gift Card sellers are both out. We need some traders willing to buy physical Amazon Gift card codes and sell bitcoin.
Please email us support
Need this within an hour, several folks waiting!
Any other gift cards also willing.
@_date: 2015-07-20 06:41:21
We're trying out best to help people, one person at a time, one call and chat at a time. We're taking the amazing feedback and putting it into the system to streamline bitcoin in preparation for mainstream adoption. Respect to all those doing the same.
Says the limit. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:53:24
very awesome!
Do you keep the bitcoin or get it turned to fiat?
Our first product was a point of sale for retail business and many NYC restaurants signed up.  
If you keep the bitcoin you should consider selling it on Paxful. We have a few greek traders selling bitcoin but they cannot keep up with the demand. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 22:11:51
Ola95 is an awesome trader and he has given us all invaluable insight and feedback. Hs customers really love him! grass roots!
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:29:16
we thought we had a week at least :/
@_date: 2015-07-18 04:44:51
We prefer people take their coins off our hot wallet and recommend that they install a phone wallet to hold all their coins. We prefer sellers keep the minimum btc in their hot wallet for escrow as well.
We're out to take bitcoin mainstream and make p2p trading safe and white hat.
Also.. backpage themselves put us in the very top of their email. 
The reason is we are actually taking the time to help their users. You can't buy that. It's hard work and concern.
@_date: 2015-07-25 17:14:16
We do know who it is.
Another "competitor" who built a nice product.They left a clear troll trail on a previous thread. They will most likely try to "steal the story". We wish they would spend their time improving their product instead of trolling and brigading us so viciously. Now is the time for the entire community to work together to lift all boats. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 01:15:05
protecting sellers is a priority for us. 
As they are the most vulnerable to scammers and they effectively "make" the market we should all be concerned with their welfare and safety. We verify our protraders and will be conducting interviews and doing several levels of KYC thus we can really trust them and will always have their backs.
The sellers we have are ultra experienced so they already know what to look for, we have a slack and whats app chat group full of pro traders going where we all talk and we will be building this into the platform soon. Our pro traders are amazing. they could teach banks a thing or two about fraud detection, we want to help them leverage their amazing knowledge base to clean up the scene 
Working together we can show the world that bitcoin is ready for primetime and that it is as much about the amazing community that has gotten it this far as it is about the technology.
@_date: 2015-08-11 09:11:24
99.9% of the gift card trades are under $20.00 and we talk to quite a few of them on the phone. doubt these single moms are in some conspiracy to buy as many gift cards as they can for bitcoin. they also all buy them with cash and show the receipt. Paxful is pretty white hat and so are the gift card trades.
@_date: 2015-07-31 01:26:46
Thank you.
The more quality productions we all put out the better the whole community looks. Amateurish efforts only hurts us but professional presentation and a message with a human touch will always make people associate Bitcoin with the very best.
@_date: 2015-07-14 01:35:09
thank you so much.
If you know other sellers who will take the time to be patient with newbies and sell small amounts please do send them our way :)
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:27:16
you rock Mark!
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:36:37
Some tough decisions need to be made by NY startups in this space but thanks to your example there are options.
The decision to put the customers first and listen to them came naturally however. We admire Shapeshifts approach to making "translation" of value among cryptocurrency as easy as using google translator. We'll be learning even more from your work and so will others.
Strong work!
@_date: 2015-07-20 03:25:20
Yes XB, you're right.
This was a big mistake by us, me in particular. People were calling up desperate for some way to buy $20 worth and our only GC vendors had retired for the day.  This was more an emotional move and a BIG mistake by myself. The pro traders like yourself quickly gathered up and came to the rescue, there was no need for newbies. We should have asked the newbies to stop and let the pros handle it, but I didn't. Our fault, Lesson.... ALWAYS LISTEN to your pros !
@_date: 2015-07-14 02:53:30
We're not in the business of selling, we're just a listing service. Besides we haven't slept in 4 days just doing support... anything else is out of the question right now. This is a grass roots community effort. This is what bitcoin is all about, this is why the world is watching all of us. Rock on.

A very special thanks to the pro trading community for their amazing feedback. 
This is a truly blessed group of amazing business people that are the very testament to how and why grass roots works and works so well. For over four years they have been trading bitcoin and the knowledge they have gained they have ALL shared with each other. Their network is amazing.
They are the real reason bitcoin will go mainstream. They feedback they gave us is nothing short of "gifted". Thank you.
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:34:05
Thank you,
This episode has opened up a window for all of us to see where we may best direct our efforts for mass adoption. 
We are now redoubling our efforts to scale out the P2P marketplace but FIRST we will finish streamlining the process from finding an offer to closing a trade to paying for something with your wallet. What we see as naturally as clicking email is fundamentally an extremely complex process.
Imagine teaching someone in 1992 how to check their email... just the process of logging into their account would give an internet newbie fits and finding their email address each time and actually composing an email. 
Like all things once a bigger segment of the world population "gets it" it kind of spreads virally and almost rubs off on people and the whole thing gets much easier even if someone has never heard of bitcoin. We're seeing it happen now!
Rock on

We need Canadian sellers now for $25+
PLEASE. we will send a ton of people your way. You can set your margins higher to cover your time costs but please help these people. need this asap.  please give us your other trading profiles if you have them.
@_date: 2015-07-20 03:45:47
A very fair narrative, thank you for this. 
You took a lot of risk and your time helping people get bitcoin and we saw how you went out of your way to help them out and answer basic questions and give them awesome support. Thank you for this, you're a real warrior for bitcoin. It's always the good guys that get burned hardest :( Let's take note that the op had a very low price for his bitcoins so he was in this to HELP not for profit. We need more people like this and we hope that if he has given up on us he will still continue to help others. We're sure he will!
We have made several big mistakes here.
1. While we did ask for "EXPERIENCED traders please! " We still manually gave authorization for you to trade. We should have better checked experience or at the very least have given each trader a Scam Prevention Guidebook for each of the payment methods we were accepting. No such guidebook exists now, but it should and it will!
2. We should have worked faster on getting more experienced sellers for small amounts in while the lull was in effect, this way we wouldn't have freaked out when The back pagers started coming in again. We thought we had a week or two at least, not two days and spent it recovering and planning, when we should have continued to work.
3. Even though we setup a slack.paxful.com chat room for all pro traders we should have been much more proactive in inviting each of the new traders there for a how to trade crash course. If we had taken a little time to draw upon the immense knowledge base of our pro traders they would have easily told the burned trader that big amounts in gift cards  twice in a row with a smaller amount first was a bad sign. This was a big mistake on our part!
4. In trying to build the "white hat" peer to peer network to help the people get bitcoin we did not take seller security seriously enough. While we listen to our pro traders and have been working non stop to give them the features they have been asking for like 2FA on everything, Clef 2FA and instant messaging coming soon, we did not yet plan out any kind of auto scam detection systems like for example. flagging a buyer who uses a very high risk payment method twice in a row with the same trader and high amounts. This is a big project for the future, the very near future.
Ok so enough beating up on ourselves, what can we do right now to fix this?
1. We're going to invite any traders we missed to our Slack chat and start conversations about the risks of each payment method
2. We're going to write up a blog posts about everything we have learned so far about the riskiest payment methods with tips to prevent scams and what to watch for.
3. We're going to send out an email to all of our verified sellers about the above posts and the slack chat.
4. All new sellers will be linked to the above resources before being allowed to make offers.
The above are all just bare basic methods to try and raise our defenses. The real work will be listening to the pro traders and implementing what they are asking for from their vast experience. We got so tied up in helping out our newbie buyers and streamlining things that we completely overlooked this vital element of the business. We're still in an open beta, we launched six weeks ago and just wanted feedback, thats why no one ever heard about us, we haven't publicly launched yet. We were completely caught off guard and we apologize.
Tomorrow, Monday, is going to be CRAZY and it only gets more intense towards Thursday, as the first BackPage ripple taught us. We will be working our best deliver on every side of the fence. Please be patient with us, as we are just a two man full-time, overtime team and we can barely keep up.
Update: 
1. We emailed the op all data we had on this scammer, ip, email, and all transaction logs, btc addresses etc,,
2. We published a beginners guide to scam detection. very raw but a start for 4:00 am in the morning. 
3. We sent out an email asking all new traders to delist their offers. We cannot possibly protect all of them at this time, we haven't even publicly launched yet and are still in beta.
4. We will refund any fees we made from any scam transactions in the future. We are not in the business of profiting from this nor will we ever be.
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:13:56
yes info
first register and then give us your username and any other trading profiles you have. we will import your history feedback etc....

There are only 3 of us. so you're not gonna see any wild acrobatics, just us on the computers and the phone helping people. We got a few hours so we're good for another few days.
We know it is hard to believe that we're actually manning the phones here and spending a half hour to walk total newbies through buying and using their first bitcoin, especially for $5 or $20 which we're not even making...
but we are. We're doing this right now and will continue to do this. 
We've put out an open source bitcoin server , one which we use. 
We've made several videos promoting bitcoin here in NYC. 
We're not perfect but we are trying our best to help bitcoin help the world. This is a real step forward for all of us.
p.s. will try and make a video but right now sleep trumps video shooting and editing, sorry. maybe a raw iPhone shot later.
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:19:32
We will be publishing more articles on this, sharing what we have learned once we have digested it ourselves.
A lot of these users while not tech savvy are business savvy and when we show the "network fee/mining fee" they ask about that. We're geeks here so we went a bit to deep into it and some got it and had more questions. We are learning just what to say to answer their questions and not overwhelm them. 
Some then want to understand what an "exchange rate" is and what a "market price" is and the whole idea of sellers setting their own prices as "traders". The ones that get it often want to start selling themselves. Pretty cool but it does  eat up a lot of time. Spent an hour with a lady in realestate that after buying her first bitcoin and asking what seemed like a 100 questions now whats to start selling bitcoin! Awesome.
A bitcoin newbie customer support Question and answer dialogue guide might be a good idea ! would help the whole community.
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:33:27
WOW, just had an awesome call with a lady who started off super confused and frustrated and now wants to sell bitcoin and help her friends. She said she paid a guy $50 for a craigslist ad to teach her how to buy bitcoin and got ripped off, then she called us!
Anyone see such ads? lets report them.
@_date: 2015-07-19 05:25:45
this cannot be ignored, this is the biggest thing to happen to bitcoin perhaps ever.
A throng of "normal" non techie folks driven to use bitcoin for their daily living, they are committed, biz savvy and a lot smarter than most would expect. Really impressed by them.
We are getting precious feedback that we will use to upgrade the entire flow.
P2p is the way bitcoin will enter the mainstream. mycelium trader and PAXful etc...
@_date: 2015-07-25 17:12:41
yes, you're right.
To us deep pockets is a low bar as we are a bootstrapped 2 man team ...
@_date: 2015-07-18 06:44:33
2:43 am... things slowed down crashing. not sleeping for days was very bad for our health the first time. get ALOT more work done when time is properly budgeted! see u tomorrow! rock on! we did awesome today. 70+ new people got bitcoins and 10+ REPEAT buyers! that is awesome!
@_date: 2015-07-20 08:25:10
We did provide the seller with all the data we had, the scammer ip, email all transactions as a csv spreadsheet. We managed to get a scammers reversals reversed for a Paypal scammer by these very same methods but we doubt it will work here as online cards give zero protection to the seller.
We have also just published an entry level warning guide which will be expanded and grow as we move forward. 
This is the best we can do at 4:00 am in the morning on a sunday.. er monday
@_date: 2015-07-19 05:27:12
we haven't even publicly launched yet. backpage just sent out a mass email with our link at the top. word of great support gets out.
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:15:34
very true. 
We've got a soft hearted ceo, he really wants to see everyone get it.
@_date: 2015-07-31 16:35:17
awesome feedback!! thank you.
the copy and pasting is very necessary yes. when we release our backpage effect video you will understand. these are folks with very few tech skills. they are committed however and if you are patient they will listen and get it! Many are also super business savvy.
All those little things in the video that seem "trivial" or unnecessary are all in response to the questions we get on the phone from normal folks. Doesn't make sense for bitcoin hardcore users but for them it makes all the difference in the world.
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:35:07
bitcoins for gift cards as it is fast and easy and good for small amts.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:39:24
You buy here directly from other people with various payment methods. With some payment methods you don't even have to leave your home like others have here recommended bank cash deposits. So instead of cash deposits you buy with paypal, e-gift cards, prepaid cards or even credit/debit. Just browser around on Paxful, there are alot of different payment methods to buy bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-07-20 05:21:05
Thank you ! We know just how much everyone is doing to grow this community and help not just this community but the world. We take even our little itty bitty task very seriously and want to do good work just like everyone else.
This work is a HUGE part of it. Getting this right will be even harder than getting a working system up and bitcoin to mainstream, as crazy as that sounds that is how sophisticated scammers seem to be and they have had a huge lead. Gonna have to dedicate an entire team to this and mobilize the whole community and knowledge base of the pro traders.
Open to suggestions from all and we will be sharing the journey!
@_date: 2015-08-10 00:40:07
NYC is great. Bitcoin and the future are far greater.
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:26:31

@_date: 2015-07-16 05:16:15
we'd love to see it and publish it! pls share!
@_date: 2015-07-18 05:50:32
Thank you for this excellent feedback. the whole reason we launched in beta was to get feedback and it has been AWESOME!
featured buyers are listed on the homepage. problem is no one even understands what that means because they do not know what a p2p market is.
Later we will have a multiple choice wizard and a video to guide them thru. we are doing this manually now.
they need to register, provide email and password, because they will be getting bitcoin to their wallet when they successfully buy, hence it must be persistent and secure. Most will be repeat buyers anyway. We are shooting for quality and safety. That is worth registering for.
These kinds of ideas are great as they get us all thinking. ALOT of work remains to be done to make this user friendly for the average human.
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:35:08
You can start a trade for target gift cards here.
There are also sellers taking paypal my cash cards
Even walmart cards
Just click buy, and start a trade, you will be in a live chat with the seller direct. follow their instructions. most don't want any ID. Paxful doesn't ask for any id from buyers.
This is the easiest way now.
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:34:56
The prices they charge are up to them, just like any other p2p marketplace. A lot of them do a lot of extra support and work for $5 orders. If they re making $2 profit for 20 minutes of support then we are happy for them. We don't make anything for the support we do. We do it for the community.
@_date: 2015-07-11 05:22:32
thank you!
We're thinking about it. Right now we need to crash and get some rest as the calls have died down. whew. after a solid 8 hrs we will brainstorm a bit. Please contact us at info or gopaxful on Skype. 
Would love to chat
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:47:03
this looks to be an ongoing thing. not sure exactly who is behind it right now but someone doesn't want this story getting out...
Edit... we do know who is behind it.. pretty clear.

thank you. this is someone with deep pockets

yes, we are a peer to peer marketplace ( listing service + btc escrow ) we do online orders only and are building a WHITE hat marketplace for to take bitcoin mainstream. We're trying the best we can to bring raw beginners into bitcoin and show them how awesome it is.
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:38:01
they are champs! trying so hard and really getting it!
they are so thankful to hear a human voice. this is all kind of like teaching people how to send email in 1990
@_date: 2015-07-20 08:27:29
We just sent you what we had and published a very short intro guide.
We will be setting up a proper seller admission process which will outline all these tips so sellers better know what they are getting in to.
Every loss hurts, especially these days. No one should have to suffer for trying to help people.
@_date: 2015-07-11 01:01:11
Hi, Thanks,
There is no secret here. Just old fashioned hard work and a real love of people. These are normal folks just like us, no judgements aside, they are working class people and quite business savvy. A lot of them are not tech literate at all but they really want to get it and that makes us REALLY want to see them get it so we give them our  number and we pick up those phones even at 2:00 AM.
Most people can get this in a heartbeat if they just see you CARE enough to help them. They are so happy when they start a trade and are talking to a trader and get their first bitcoin. Really feels good seeing that. When they send out their first bitcoin from their Paxful wallet it is another big win for all of us. 
Then we recommend wallets for them to download on their phone so they can hold all their own bitcoin themselves. We explain how holding their own money and being their own bank is good and they totally get it! This is a well networked group that likes to help each other.
The amazing thing is how many calls we get from people who never even saw the website... they are just passing our number around and telling each other that these guys can help. So right now it is just customer support. If anyone is in NYC and wants to help us do phone support you are more than welcome to help :) info
Our customer support internet collapsed after 3 days of 20 hours of work a day. She is on a sleep vacation now. We're drinking lots of coffee. this is awesome. bitcoin is winning!
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:15:02
European demand is growing. We need to localize the site first to really bring it in and figure out how to streamline support chat. Can u sell? we can send the euro sepa buyers your way
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:14:36
love the feedback thank you!
everything you say we here and we are working on. but first we're gonna crash for about 16 hrs
@_date: 2015-07-14 06:58:39
Here is a picture of support chat on a slow hour. 10 chats backlogged at least.
Not a picture from phone for received calls, but here are missed calls while took some breath today couple of times. 
Also a honest feedback from seller on Paxful.com  
@_date: 2015-07-18 03:16:15
yes! we are going to update the trade page asap.
we thought we had a few more days. next version will be much more intuitive and take p2p to the next level.
thank you!
@_date: 2015-07-20 05:31:50
that is a great idea!
we want to integrate betrayed, onename etc into our verification platform, along with fb, twitter, linked in and google + etc..
it is all on the list. We're just limping along at this point trying to handle the flood.

Hi Tony,
Awesome presentation! 
We sent you a tip. We have been flooded with backpagers looking for bitcoin at paxful and our intern Sarah has been helping them through the whole process. she has a few suggestions for your slides from all the feedback she has gotten. Where can we email you?
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:29:01
please try again, we got so many emails our server burped. 
should work now. promise
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:42:50
Sorry, currently we have only online payment methods. In-person cash trades payment method is disabled for now as it is different from online methods.
@_date: 2015-07-11 21:52:40
the key is listening tot he customer and respecting them. we have learned so much listening to these folks. they ask awesome questions!!!
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:29:00
Thanks but we're not sponsoring anything now. Just taking calls non stop and helping people get bitcoins and learn how to use them.
Working on a how to guide and videos as we speak.. er type.
we're no marketing gurus, the one course I took in college on that I got a D+ .... :/
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:36:53
You can create your ad and it will be visible even if you don't have bitcoins deposited to us. Moreover you will get email/notification every time somebody looks at your profile or ad. This way you get idea how many potential buyers are browsing. Moreover finally private messaging on p2p marketplace will be out by end of this month, so you can directly message to any user outside the trade.
Besides that our approach to UI is completely different and our goal is to convert as many first time buyers as possible so they would get good impressions of bitcoin and how easy it is to actually buy and use it. Another great feature is that we support any payment method, you can just create it yourself and set your rules - payment window, fiat range, terms etc.
We have been around 1 and half year, initially started with merchant POS for accepting bitcoin. Whole year we were building this marketplace and launched it 6 weeks ago and we actually didn't have any official press release yet.
Also we are listening what features are asking pro-traders and are implementing them. For example pro trader ola confirms it here  
With the tremendous amount of feedback we are getting with our customer support we are improving UX every day for buyers as well as for sellers.
@_date: 2015-08-19 17:49:58
itawyola is one of our best vendors and he even gives them his phone number to walk them through step by step!
@_date: 2015-07-18 13:51:42
Can anyone sell bitcoin for
STEAM WALLET? we have had several requests to buy with steam.
@_date: 2015-07-18 05:27:32
yes, of course you are right!
We all need to ever on alert as the scams rain down like well... rain in the crypto space. our customers are really the professional traders that work so hard to create the market. They are not an easy crowd to fool as they have literally seen everything. Their massive knowledgeable of fraud detection could surpass most financial institutions that have been around for hundreds of years. We'v been talking with them for almost 7 weeks now. We listen to every word they say and are actively building what they ask for.
Our goals are pretty clear. to take bitcoin mainstream. We know peer to peer marketplaces are the key to that. We're dedicated to building the very best one and that only happens when you LISTEN. That is what we are here for.
@_date: 2015-07-30 23:43:36
yes, brilliant!
@_date: 2015-07-15 04:08:02
Tolan77 is legit. He has worked around the clock to deliver bitcoins to newbies for $5-$20. His support is awesome and he is as patient as they come. We are all lucky to have him with us. 
There are plenty of scammers out there but Tolan77 delivers every time and he does it with patience and grace. Instead of accusing him why not try and do better than him? Can you sell bitcoins for $5-$20 ? we can send many first timers your way. He does an average of 10-15 minutes of support for each. If that isn't worth $2 to you we understand but to some people it is more than worth it.
Lets work together to spread bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:16:49
sorry for not replying, will check reddit pms when we wake
@_date: 2015-07-14 06:42:58
Please sign up and tell us your email to info we will give you sell offers creation rights. Also will port over your stats and give you verified seller and legacy trader badges.
Selling online with certain payment methods has some risks indeed, that's why currently on  selling is open only for experienced online sellers. We have received alot of feedback and are creating a wiki style knowledgebase where is all info related to bitcoin p2p trading.
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:36:47
we have many sellers but we need those who sell for small alts like $20. paypal is very risky so sellers ask for selfies with id, verified accounts etc. we have a private chat where we all share info and best practices.
@_date: 2015-07-11 05:08:13
Just so everyone knows. Mark is an awesome trader and one of the most honest and hard working guys we know. He trades on Paxful as  and has helped many people.
@_date: 2015-07-20 08:59:00
sorry, but for 4:00 am after a day full of calls perfect grammar will have to wait till we get some sleep.
@_date: 2015-07-31 01:25:35
thank you, we took our time and wanted to do it right.
The bitcoin community should always look the very best and be known for top notch production and execution.
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:02:01
We as a community have ALOT of work to do before bitcoin becomes viable for people. Bitcoin can and will replace Visa and MasterCard and a lot sooner than people may think but we cannot over state the IMMENSE and INTENSE amount of work this will take.
A mentor of mine said a good CEO listens to his customer and a great CEO does one full day of customer service every week. After having done almost two full weeks of this non stop I see how right he was. We at Paxful now see every single pain point there is in the eco system.
Backpage has taken an awesome lead here and they are honestly doing everything in their power. they are learning too and we as a community must see things from their perspective. The fault is not there own but ours for not being "ready". Not beating up on ourselves or the community just taking responsibility.
Look for more guides and videos from us as well as some breakthrough "connecting" widgets. The real work for us as a community has only just begun. We haven't even tried reaching out to the mainstream and we have quite a bit of work to do before we are ready. We'll be sharing everything we've learned in an article, video and AMA soon.
We will all do this together.

@_date: 2015-07-22 03:51:25

Please email support right away if you can take small alts like $24 of walmart. we have dozens of people wanting to trade right now.
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:37:12
1. We verify all our sellers to create a safe environment
2. Our reputation system is NOT anonymous and people can reply to feedback. We also base it per trade, not per partner. These little changes are massive for traders and they have been requesting this for some time.
3. Trading process is much more buyer friendly. Try and start a trade. it is a big step forwards.
4. We value UI and buyer experience and will continue to improve our design.
5. Our payments system is an open ended tagging system much like Stack Overflow
6 We have a badge system for members and will be introducing more social features
This is just our mvp launch. We will be introducing a big update soon which will leap frog things forwards and execute on al the feedback we have gotten. Escrow services that allow people to trade bitcoin will all follow a certain structure, we are confident that by taking in the input of the bitcoin community this service will evolve to another level and be a place where we can all trade safely and grow the community.
@_date: 2015-07-20 06:46:04
this is a great idea!
We all need to band together to do this.
We are all sharing info and writing how to guides on paxful.slack.com msg us for an invitation. We will share everything we have learned and will be publishing it all soon.
Working together we can brainstorm and come up with more ways to do this even better!

most brokerages take 4-5 days the first time, which is far too long for people. they want them same day, within the hour. Only a peer to peer marketplace can do that. We'll be launching our wizard soon which should vastly simply the process.
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:11:10
Most of our buyers are american. We do get a lot of sepa orders so if you are skilled at doing btc sepa sales you are welcome to sell. We'd verify you and you could help the Euro customers. We get a lot of UK, french and germany buyers who do need help.
Gift cards are good for the US, european traders mostly use SEPA. Paypal is very risky for sellers and we do not recommend it. Sellers can do a lot of good in the trade chat. guiding the buyers to buying and using their first bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-25 17:27:16
rock on Iron Mike!
@_date: 2015-07-10 21:58:45
It's ok because they are all coming over to Paxful and we are guiding them through step by step. We've been on the phone with total newbies for 3 days and it is amazing how happy they are once they figure it out. this is the start of something big.
Also in defense of CoinCafe or any other brokers, these buyers all want $5-$20.... far to small an amount for most exchanges to bother with. Not us, we are happy to walk through a first time buyer who wants $5 worth, it helps bitcoin!
All help is appreciated!
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:43:40
chat was major backlogged yesterday any about 69 people and calls too we are now catching up as our BP traffic doubled. these videos and how to guides are really helping as are the amazing vendors on paxful who are all giving one on one support!

Hi there, we at  are already testing internally the wizard integration that you just described. We are looking for partner websites/wallets with whom we can do pilot. I hope you guys at enjoybitcoins are interested, please email us info
We support unlimited payment methods as they can be dynamically created by sellers and trading happens p2p as we are not brokerage website but listing + escrow service.

We can tell you it is simple and flows well enough that it will really help them. We've been handling their refugees for the past five days and it has been an awesome learning experience that is really helping us fine tune our peer to peer marketplace for the mainstream.

We have same thing, volume coming from backpage people is tremendous. Our sellers on  can't keep up with all the buyers.
It is already happening almost for 2 weeks and we have done our analysis of situation and summed it up in a blog post 
@_date: 2015-07-20 08:42:52
Yes. It is our job.
We did not link these users together. The scammer most likely searched him out. To stop these we would have to have automated fraud detection systems in place that would not hamper newbie buyers like back pagers and while stopping scammers. 
This level of fraud detection is a feat several orders of magnitude than anything that currently out there. A bootstrapped two man team cannot hope to do this without immense support.

A sponsored article but it has some real gems.
"That is the lesson here. Digital currencies can and will adapt to the population they serve with the help of smart entrepreneurs. They will do so with—or without—the help of banks."
This is a big lesson here and we have seen it in action. Bitcoin is more and more becoming the international glue between a variety of digital local currencies, whether it be Amazon Gift Cards, M-Pesa or Second Life Linden Dollars, bitcoin is serving a real purpose as a trade medium between them all.
This is why we are launching the worlds first global peer to peer bitcoin exchange that is built from the ground up for this purpose.  Msg us at info for early access.
You will be able to sell bitcoin for anything and the mainstream users will have the easiest fastest ui for buying bitcoin instantly. Win for all.
See you in a week at

Brilliant summary of what a currency is. This is a vital question, the only question more important is... 
what is money?
currency and money are not the same thing, money is a more foundational thing and understanding what is truly is is critical to our prosperity. If every human on earth could answer this question we would have the natural abundance that we all deserve as human beings.
Benjamin Franklin and the thirteen colonies did an amazing amount to prove this.  
We at panful gave a presentation about this last year and it was a great experience. The work we all do now to grow the bitcoin space will end in more and more people knowing exactly what money is and in this knowledge comes great freedom. 
for our part we are building a peer to peer bitcoin marketplace that will bring more bitcoin to the masses. It will be the best possible way for a newbie to buy bitcoin instantly and for a pro trader to earn. We are in private beta right now. If you want to join us please email info
@_date: 2015-04-12 21:21:04
 will be launching the new peer to peer market for the masses. You will be able to buy bitcoin instantly using cash deposit via banks, gift cards, and nearly every other payment system. Fast and secured with a escrow and reputation system. 
Buying bitcoin instantly is still very challenging, we want to make it as simple as possible for buyers to connect with sellers on a peer to peer basis. This allows for transactions under an hour.
Will keep you posted. We built an exchange last year and know exactly how to make things easier for all involved.

Great to see folks in the UK supporting bitcoin.
London has always been a financial hub with the forex etc and it is inspiring to see them race to lead in crypto as well. We are all doing our part and should be supportive of every cities aspirations to "lead" the crypto space. Berlin, Amsterdam are also leading with NYC sneaking in at fourth and Austin very close. LA is also moving up there fast!

Was an awesome meeting in Helsinki. 
On the left is Paxful Artur, Ray and our buddy Max and the right is LocalBitcoins Jeremias and his brother Nicholas.
The LBC guys were total gentlemen and ultra laid back and chill. We're lucky as a community these guys are at the helm of the leading p2p exchange. More news soon.
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:40:21
Just reminding that it's not centralized exchange where we (Paxful) are selling bitcoins. It's peer 2 peer marketplace where users post their buy/sell offers and do trades between each other. Paxful here is providing platform for smooth trading and optional escrow service.  
About Paypal example. If user posts an offer for buy/sell BTC for Paypal then because of a high risk payment method he should protect himself against chargebacks. We will have community driven wiki for each payment method so everybody could share there tutorials, risks and anything else related to it
@_date: 2015-09-27 19:43:39
You really get it! Bravo. Please do message us. We'd love your input on a few new initiatives to bring this out to the open. Right now it is just us nurturing this but if the whole community got by it it would be amazing.
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:21:04
a very smart and pragmatic approach.
We are building a peer to peer bitcoin marketplace at 
It will allow people to move move value around the world using bitcoin as a medium. Whatever local payment methods exist will be supported on a crowd sourced basis. 
For example you could buy bitcoin online instantly at panful.com from a korean fellow in LA by giving him a local korea prepaid card code. He would give this to his family in Korea to spend locally and send you bitcoin.
You could then sell that bitcoin at a big markup to someone in the usa for dollars delivered either to your bank account or any other native payment method.
We've got a vibrant beta test community already and would love someone from Korea to show us what problems they need solved. Please email us at info

This is an amazing accomplishment for a bitcoin company at this stage. All it takes is one major geopolitical event to turn everyone to bitcoin and then we could see these numbers increase 100x

Strong work Rodolfo

well said, this is the first time people need bitcoin just to do their jobs. It is the first true mainstream test for bitcoin and so many people did not even consider it. We got a call for a very concerned lady that really opened our eyes and showed us how vital this all was.
She really is the hero of all this.
@_date: 2015-09-25 16:29:50
Your logic is excellent. 
The ecosystem is simply not there yet because it is so hard to get bitcoin for the average person. The issue here is one of bitcoin's greatest strengths is actually what is holding it back as the danger of fraud and scams makes selling bitcoin very dangerous. Any for of fiat payment can be reversed with enough political will. This means on-boarding people is difficult and can only really be done via peer to peer as the ach of a Coinbase or Circle takes far to long for first time buyers that want to purchase something right away. Once they do purchase the bitcoin they use it all. There is little reason for them to hold onto bitcoin. 
Case in point is the BackPage Effect. 
This taught us an amazing amount. 
Bitcoin has to conquer many trials, first being ease of use and second being ease of acquisition. We have made every effort to get bitcoins to the unbanked right here in the USA and it has shown us just how much work has yet to be done.
This is the hard truth we had to accept ourselves. We first began as a merchant processor for retail and we worked feverishly to signup restaurants but that did not stick, much as Bitpay is seeing. We need to use Bitcoin for what the people want to use it for... 
The reluctant superhero that comes to the rescue when the banks and Visa MasterCard etc abandon the people.
@_date: 2015-09-27 19:39:49
AGREED! 
Very well said. They are all bitcoin users and not just to save a buck, but for their day to day LIVING, which has to be the first time ever this has happened. This is really one of the biggest things to happen to bitcoin and it has taught us all incredible amount.
We talk we these bitcoin users everyday and we have come to see the entire process from their eyes. it has shown us just how far we have to go to prepare bitcoin for the mainstream. It is a long way but the good news is we do not have to prepare the mainstream for bitcoin as the banks are doing that for us, as the get more and more complacent and their grip goes ever onerous the economic censorship will only increase and bitcoin will be ready.
These folks are not thinking about the blocksize debate or any other debate, they are just trying to figure out the easiest fastest way to get bitcoin and to use it. Copying and pasting on mobile is a skill many of them have had to learn for bitcoin. Something as simple as clicking the menu icon on a mobile browser is new to many but they are doing it! 
These folks are determined and we must respect them for that. It is inspiring to see them figure it out. It is what has inspired us to stay on the phone with them for hours a day. 
Major kudos to you for zooming out and seeing the big picture. If we all did this bitcoin would be one every phone by now. Many people did not want to abandon telnet for checking email either but things do change. Leader are stepping up. We will all look back on the backpage effect and say wow, that really was the start huh? Sure is and it is going strong and we are rasising conversions more and more with over 12,000 brand new bitcoin users so far in less than three months.
The future is very bright for bitcoin. Rock on!

Hi all,
We started out as a merchant processor for retail bitcoin. We got early success getting retail merchants to try bitcoin out last year. We got everything from newsstands to nice nyc restaurants.
We made the best and simplest pos for merchants to accept bitcoin, we even let them accept bitcoin without any internet via our zero click system. 
We gave it our best and really tried to tell the stories of merchants. We even built a Living Map, so that people could see merchants accepting bitcoin in real time and know when the last time they accept bitcoin was. 
After about a year we had to accept that the ecosystem is simply not ready to support this in any kind of sustained way. BitPay's stats will confirm this. On the ground even when we convinced merchants to try bitcoin as it was so simple, had no fees and promised some new customers we had to work actively to send them a steady flow of bitcoiners just to justify their continued use and training of staff. This was simply not sustainable.
We still offer this merchant solution and it is the easiest around. Our map is growing steadily with new merchants from all over the world. We can make this work but it must be in an organic way and not forced.
This is why we are introducing a new peer to peer bitcoin marketplace in a week. It will be the easiest fastest way to buy bitcoin online via any and every payment method you can think of. Those that want early access to the marketplace please email us at info
We hope that buy giving new bitcoin buyers and bitcoin power sellers a highly improved buying experience when it comes to buying bitcoin instantly that we can organically grow the ecosystem and bring in a whole new demographic to bitcoin.
We will do this. One step at a time. 
-Paxful is your peer to peer bitcoin marketplace.
@_date: 2015-09-15 21:57:30
Hi, Try Paxful.
you don't need a bank account and can buy with gift cards, debit, cash deposit or online wallets like PayPal.
This video explains it. 
We try and help everyone.
@_date: 2015-10-07 22:19:07
Gift cards will be a $140 Billion dollar economy in a few years. Fold app is pretty awesome and brings immense value to the bitcoin economy in ways people can understand. 
At Paxful we are using giftcards in the opposite way for people to get bitcoins. They high availability and desire among traders makes them a perfect way to onboard new bitcoin buyers. These is immense potential in this market. when one thinks of it gift cards are a cousin to crypto currencies and considering their economy is over 100x bigger than bitcoin there is alot we can do to help both economies. Problem solvers should look at this space more closely.
@_date: 2015-10-16 14:22:51
Here is a proof for you.
We do really need help of community to get bitcoins into more peoples hands
@_date: 2015-10-13 06:56:25
Someone's got to do it. The challenges here are of two distinctly different types. One to get them bitcoin in a way that is frictionless for customers, and no it won't happen the way you think it will, and two there needs to be the infrastructure on the bitcoin to fiat side to allow these business to pay for their utility bills etc with their bitcoin wallets.
alot of work to do here but this alone will triple the size of the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:00:21
we changed our name yeah. should have clarified.  will do so in a new post
@_date: 2015-10-17 02:32:47
You could help alot of ladies. PayPal is very risky to sell with. If you can make 100% sure they are all BP ladies u should be safe otherwise...

Sounds like a game changer! rock on!
Can't wait for the next commercial either.
@_date: 2015-10-11 14:02:44
This is real data. We can confirm the same on our end. p2p bitcoin trading continues to grow steadily and we have just had a massive growth spike. There is no one simplistic reason. Even the effect of having the 2nd biggest classifieds ads site on the internet depend on bitcoin isn't enough. This is a phase shift that is just beginning to open the gates to real mainstream bitcoin adoption. 
The future is bright. We all have ALOT of work to do to make things simpler.
