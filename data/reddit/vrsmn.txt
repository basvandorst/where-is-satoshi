Free speech is illegal in Venezuela, so, why not help them with bitcoin donations, even if it is illegal?
I suppose there is some people who want to run away from Venezuela, but only have bolivarian pesos, they could buy bitcoins and escape from the country.

They already had this information, they probably wanted to verify the information to sell to other companies.
I'm tired of this, paypal and bitcoin are much more useful and doesn't cancel my account if I don't update my account details periodically

he tried bitcoin-24, but something went wrong when he tried to transfer the money
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:03:45
I have ordered them, but how many units they have sold? How would that affect the market?
That's why I think I couldn't get my bitcoins invested back, sure, bitcoin will be more valuable, but the capitalist me says that I should have kept my bitcoins. But if I've bought them using dollars, I wouldn't lose anything (if btc doesn't fail in the future)

bitcoin foundation is not centralizing the bitcoin, but organizing efforts and getting funds to improve the development.
Bitcoin is still opensource, if you don't trust them, and you have a development company, you can pay some of your developers to work on the Bitcoin source code. Anything that tries to centralize the protocol will ruin it's central idea

how that bitcointip works? Googled for, but only found the reddit user,
I've been seeing tips here for weeks, loved this idea
UPDATE: found a start guide

whoa, at that point, r/Bitcoin may be full of rats trying to make some worthless dollars :)
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:45:17
wow, are they actively searching, or this was automatic? I just added to the coinmap.org

Chinese government was famous for draconian laws, and being aggressive with everything that is "against the government", isn't curious that they are openly using bitcoins?
If Avalon ASICs are being funded directly with bitcoins, things are changing really fast
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:51:57
we could point our LOICs to their address, 
there is almost 600 people online on r/Bitcoin

something that may happen if drug related bitcoins go mixed with clean bitcoins in the same address ;)

takes too long to send money, expensive, etc.
that's why bitcoin matters, the problem is to get it into the country
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:42:15
so, bitcoin prices will be different everywhere, this is normal even for "real" currencies if you consider the price of some common stuff, like Coca Cola or Big Mac (which are different in many places 
Here in Brazil, bitcoins are 10% to 25% more expensive than the mt gox exchange rate, they are scarce and mining here is hard

backing up my wallet isn't just a good idea, it's essential.
I've been using bitcoins since 2010, never lost a single coin until today. Had backups for my computer wallets, but forgot to backup my phone wallet, perhaps they should make this mandatory for the app. Sometimes people are busy or just lazy to backup data
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:36:20
amazing, bought the innovator's dilemma that he just mentioned, and started reading it few days ago because bitcoin. I'm really puzzled about how this impractical thing could be something awesome some day
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:53:55
price isn't dropping too much, what happened? People finally learned that they shouldn't sell when lag is high, or mtgox added some protection to avoid price drop?
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:58:42
thought the same thing, but it is from CNN. Also, seems that they are abandoning zimbabwe dollars, 
so, why not?
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:29:16
thanks for the tip. Just installed bitcoin wallet again and exported the keys, sent a copy to my email too. Will look for TB later

BFL miner in stock? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:09:32
because bitcoin is listed there
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:15:54
that was painful. Created a new issue in the app github page, to add something to remember users to backup their phone wallets.

Bitcoin IS decentralized, anything that removes this from the protocol will ruin it's initial purpose.
The Bitcoin Foundation is very important to improve the clients, standardize the protocol (to avoid blockchain forks) and perhaps fund research on cryptography, so we'll have time to fix any potential security problem before anyone takes advantage of it. Isn't that enough?
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:06:11
if I had them right now. But I want to know what would happen when everyone got theirs too
I'm starting to think that the mining market just failed in my face :)
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:07:24
Some, used them to buy ASICs and go back to the gold rush

I don't fully believe in this film, but their story about where the printed money go is really interesting, I tought the community would like it
But I agree with you in the sense that the movie is very sensationalistic
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:35:38
bitcoin foundation is an organization to fund the protocol development, if you have any money to donate. This is serious business, if we have any security problem in the cryptography or something similar, all the economy would be ruined
But you can donate work directly, just by participating in the software development, the source is there.

go spend your bitcoins, I'll keep the few I got.
living in Brazil, they are REALLY hard to get, no intention to sell/trade at this value yet. But I recognize that it wouldn't have the current value if people were not selling theirs
PS: but I would work for for bitcoins
PPS: I'm a RoR developer, anyone interested?
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:10:11
awesome! Just took a screenshot of that moment, you can see clearly the price dropping after that 5000btc sale
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:36:19
by "bribes", you mean paying Gavin monthly?
we need to eat, I don't see anything wrong with that. In fact, I would like to see more foundations being created, so we'll have more peer reviewed work and people working on various aspects of the protocol which they believe it is important. Please, create a "Libertarians Bitcoin Foundation", I would also love to have a "Latin American Bitcoin Foundation", unfortunately I don't think we have enough people here for that. Help to create another organizations, and let they do their work, they were funded by people who wanted to help, voluntary, and they don't criticize the creation of any other organizations
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:21:39
usually they don't pay with bitcoin, but if you offer 10% discount they change their minds about it
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:20:40
"don't tell me you boys have been spending duplicated money"
that's exactly what bitcoin is about
@_date: 2013-03-26 05:57:15
4x 60 GH/s Butterfly Labs and one 85 GH/s Avalon.
but then I was thinking, if I could get my bitcoins back with mining, which will become much harder with the ASICs entering in the market
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:39:30
it's his money now, he could buy drugs from SL too. I don't care :)
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:45:16
got about 250 bitcoins in 2010, when CPU mining was enought
lost the interest because no one of my friends wanted to join or showed interest, I'm a bit depressed since last year.
@_date: 2013-09-17 15:13:28
also, will bitpay do anything about this?
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:43:21
journalists would love that story
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:24:50
yes, I have a friend who is profitting from buying bitcoins in the US and selling them here, and reducing the cost to make some quick money for him
But in Brazil technology is expensive, so all hardware/computers and other things that need to me imported, that somehow reflects in the price of bitcoin here. Probably because we have too few miners
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:41:33
their economy is ruined because of government intervention, so the government took some other measures to fix everything
like a ministry of supreme happiness, and declaring christmas in november
@_date: 2013-03-26 11:54:39
66958260 would be 10x the current difficult, and yes, would be profitable for me
I got pretty pessimistic, and started to think that could get bigger than 10x, I really have no idea since they are selling a lot of ASICs, ButterFly Labs scares me, they have so many orders that I'll lose my bitcoins invested if they produce or not, if they deliver all ASICs, the market will be flooded with GH/s, if not, I just don't get my miner
(I bought both BFL and Avalon)
@_date: 2013-03-22 11:12:37
with the current price growth rate, the capitalist me still would give a 10% discount
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:58:16
it is dropping, but seems much slower. It was showing $96, and now is back to $101
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:46:16
this "centralization" is because they are actually doing something people need, the same way github centralized the source code management, and MtGox centralized the exchange volume. No coersion during the process, everything was voluntary, if you can't understand that, I don't know what else to say. Bitcoin Foundation is only recognized because of it's work, it wasn't forced like any sovereign currency, people just accepted it's legitimacy for now, in Gavin we trust, and for being open source
But feel free to create your own bitcoin organization, and also, do that please, I'd love to see more things like that happening
@_date: 2013-09-17 20:14:25
this is their official site, 
they are working to get official party status, or something like that. I don't know much about that. But there are some few people interested in libertarian ideas in Brazil
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:41:35
sure, people will hoard bitcoins. But the deflation makes me want to work for bitcoins, so I just need to keep a positive balance. Like "real" money.
I have more incentives to work for bitcoins than to work for dollar, I actually give priority to those customers who pay me using bitcoins (I am a freelance programmer)
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:18:27
here, these are their goals, 
Bitcoin is currently the most actively developed cryptocurrency, if you want it to succeed, the software and the protocol must evolve, while we are complaining about the foundation, Gavin is doing his work funded by the same foundation.
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:41:01
I just can't believe, today I convinced a customer in France to pay me (in Brazil) using bitcoins, offered 10% discount and everything, but he couldn't find a way to buy bitcoins. When he tried btc24 (this is the name i guess), his bank wasn't allowed to do international wire
Bitcoins MUST get higher value soon, or we won't have any coins to trade
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:14:10
I don't understand how libertarianism could be agains organizations, I want to be part of that organization, and I could leave anytime I want to. I can't just leave my country or stop paying taxes, this is coercive power.
Bitcoin Foundation have Gavin, MtGox, BitInstant, Coinbase and other who did great work to the Bitcoin economy, so yeah, it quite makes it the official Bitcoin Foundation.
We have diversity, you can choose between various cryptocurrencies already, if you fork Bitcoin, you'll end up with a different currency, prefer Litecoin? No problem, use it. Bitcoin will lose value and people will leave it, you can't be totally decentralized when it is about the protocol, everyone needs to agree and keep the blockchain without any forks.
Bitcoin is like a big p2p startup, everyone who contributed with the early blocks, funded ASICs companies, and funded the Bitcoin Foundation, is an investor, we want our return back. And for that we need a working system as we expected, otherwise everyone will leave, because a centralized Bitcoin would be worthless nothing.
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:31:46
libertarianism doesn't forbid the creation of organizations that are funded by individuals. That's what the Bitcoin Foundation is
@_date: 2013-03-27 04:15:51
thanks, fixed that
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:53:23
That's interesting, I would like to know that story, if Bitcoin Foundation has any interest in coercive powers, that is dangerous. But a member opinion doesn't reflect the Foundation, so, nothing to worry about
I am there, watching and discussing, it is really interesting to have direct contact with the core developers, people contribute with their opinions, and the debate happens. Totally normal to me, as a libertarian, I like diversity
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:28:26
I guess that this is exactly what they should be doing, funding development, promotion and doing research, why should they get involved in anything else? We have limited resources, and I hope they focus on these things
There is some confusion between centralizing the whole thing, and organizing efforts, I think it is important to have this kind of organizations. Perhaps another "European Bitcoin Foundation", "Latin American Bitcoin Foundation", to have more peer reviewed work, and more people working. It is hard to get funds without an organization for that. And it is completely voluntary, no one has to contribute.
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:00:49
yeah, a friend sent me this video when I told him that the UK geography was interesting, LOL'ed when saw bitcoins used as a symbol for money/wealth. Note that this video was uploaded in jul/2012

US now is my less favorite country
@_date: 2013-03-26 05:44:24
the risk is not the drop in the price, but for mining. With the current popularity of the ASICs and their price (in bitcoins), the difficult rate could get so high, that would be impossible to get the bitcoins insvested back.
Still don't know what are the odds
PS: The mining rush will probably increase the value, so, buying bitcoins may be a good idea. Not so sure if mining is a good investment now
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:02:11
thanks for this explanation, the news is really confusing, it says "officially approves" and after that "Rumors have it from unidentified sources that Mr. Robert Mugabe approved the ground breaking move to BitCoin as his nations national currency."
