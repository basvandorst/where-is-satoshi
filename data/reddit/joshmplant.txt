Coinbase is really pissing me off. I use the instant buy everyday.... Because they take over a week to process regular buys. So now I can only get 1 BTC because it is "expensive"????

How safe are these? Can't they just keep a copy of all the private keys, and brute force them open?

They are allowing users to point their hashing power elsewhere?

The IPCO is to help with the development of the API and further branding. We should support nearly all the altcoins to build a stronger community. This is a new frontier, and we should be helping, supporting, and guiding everyone on their journey. Tip DOGE, tip RDD, tip LTC.... just help grow the crypto-economy.

I'd have to agree; the website made me question more than want to donate...

Cex.io is a complicated beast, but it is possible to use it wisely and profitably. There are obvious issues, but they are a beta start-up attempting to solve the problems faced by at-home-mining.
