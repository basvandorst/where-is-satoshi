Fucked by Coinbase again... I sold 8 days ago and today it just threw it back into my account and never went through.

Guess his name doesn't check out??
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:26:46
Alright thanks
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:30:41
HODL AND BUY!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:03:41
You know it's going to drop to 10k, so if you don't sell now you're basically losing out on 33% of your money. Sell high rebuy low!

I sold my BTC on coinbase 3 days ago and still have nothing showing up on my bank account, wtf??
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:57:21
It's gone - move on
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:13:43
I invested yesterday morning at 12800 haaaaaaa
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:57:12
Haven't checked but is there really another sell wall at 17.8? Is it as bad as it was at 17.25?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:37:55
Thing is I haven't downloaded anything! I can't even download anything without admin privileges.

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:06:46
That's what they said yesterday at $12,800...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:17:00
It hit 16k
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:04:05
$400 dip in 1 min lol

There are only two things in life we are certain of:
1. Death
2. Never having a shortage of memes
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:26:03
Break out the 15k memes!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:56
Nope this is the dip xD

Yesterday my card was frozen by my bank for making a purchase on coinbase. While talking to my bank to have it unfrozen, he said it's been happening to a ton of people lately because a lot of people are purchasing on coinbase now. He said he expects it to keep happening and more frequently.

I'll give it 1 or 2 months before bitcoin and bcash swap places on the leaderboard, thx to coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:24:01
"WONKA! I want off this boat now!" 
"NO! WE'RE HODLLINNGGGGG!!!!"
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:03:56
Makes perfect sense. Call your bank.

Just got a notification on my work computer that it detected and removed a CoinMining program... has anyone seen this before???
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:29:18
Reading online it says typically 1-2 business days, also it shows that it was completed on my account on 12/19 - just very deceiving...
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:23:20
Game over boys - get out now while you still can
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:54
if it goes up you make money. if it goes down you lose money. That's how it works. But if you had invested 10 minutes ago you would've just made 10% on that 400.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:00:01
Already up at 14330... Better rebuy, this is the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:14:42
Yeah wait for the dip at this point! /s
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:28:22
 Holy fuck!!!
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:39:28
