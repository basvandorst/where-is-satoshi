There's a problem with *not* using LIFO, and maybe the IRS will find some way to deal with this in the future:
If I want to use $500 USD to buy some LSK tomorrow, I have to first buy BTC, not to keep as property, but as a tool to convert my USD to LSK. The USD will be in BTC form for about 10 minutes as I move the money around.
(Actually, worse than that! Since right now LTC is cheaper and easier to transfer, my flow will go more like: USD to LTC to BTC to LSK, meaning that, along the way, I will have bought and sold $100 of LTC, and then $100 of BTC!)
So, if I have some old LTC and BTC that has tripled since I bought it, a straight FIFO approach would mean that I just earned $66 in LTC and $66 in BTC. 
I will have "earned" $132, while all I'm really doing is buying $100 in LSK!
I see a couple possible solutions:
1. Use LIFO. Then the temporary purchases &amp; sales won't show any profits being taken.
2. Use FIFO, pay big taxes now, and accept the fact that if all crypto plummets by 95%, I will have paid more in taxes than the value of my entire portfolio.
3. (Bold?) Simply report the 3-part transaction (USD to LTC to BTC to LSK) as a single purchase of $100 worth of LSK.
The problem with  is that I can't just transfer my trades and export them as a simple report. Instead, I have to go in and edit the heck out of whatever records I have.
And they won't usually look as simple as that. It will probably look more like:
1. 500 USD to 10 LTC
2. 10 LTC to 0.05 BTC
3. 0.02 BTC to 20 LSK
4. 0.02 BTC to 2 XMR
5. 0.01 BTC to 30 STRAT
That's still convertible, but it takes a little time, math and imagination to convert that to:
1. 200 USD to 20 LSK
2. 200 USD to 2 XMR
3. 100 USD to 30 STRAT
Until some WYSIWYG tool comes along that lets us take our exchange data and simplify it to this form, it seems like LIFO is the only option for now...?

There's a joke, involving the meaninglessness of stock splits, where the customer is watching a cook pulling his pizza out of the oven.
Cook: Would you like me to cut this into 6 slices or 8?
Customer: Better cut it into 8. We're pretty hungry!
If a guy honestly can't afford 0.005 BTC ($32.50), it might not be worth his effort to invest (although some believe that $32.50 will go to $2500 when BTC goes to $500k).
OTOH, if the guy has $325 to spend, but doesn't think he's getting enough Bitcoin when he only buys 0.05 BTC, then the answer is:
He should buy some mBTC instead! Right now, he can score *fifty thousand* mBTC for his $325. And it's guaranteed to go up at the same rate as Bitcoin!
Long on mBTC!
And you better cut that pizza into 10 slices, we're super hungry!

Sign up with GDAX (actually part of Coinbase; it uses the same login ID, but requires some additional signup).
When you transfer money from your bank, it's free, but it takes 3 to 5 business days to get to GDAX.
If you place a limit order, rather than a market order, it's free (someone please check me on this).
So you end up spending time (for the transfer) and brainpower (to work the more complicated GDAX system), rather than spending any money on fees.

Actually, it seems like the buy and sell prices at Coinbase are somewhat close to each other, although both well above CoinMarketCap's listed price.
* CoinMarketCap says BTC is about $4100 USD.
* Coinbase will let me sell for about $4300.
* Coinbase will let me buy for about $4350.
For the size of my buys and sells, the Coinbase buy vs sell spread is no big deal.
Even my thoughts of doing a little quick amateur "arbitrage" don't add up.
Please feel free to correct me if my numbers are wrong here…
If I could sell about $1000 worth of BTC at the Coinbase price, then wait X amount of time until Coinbase and CoinMarketCap are back into sync, and then rebuy, I'd be chasing down a profit of about $50, minus fees and my time and effort.
Still, it would be nice when I see that BTC has dropped down to about $4000, if I could swing by my trusty Coinbase and buy some at that sweet price.

It seems like a lot of us are noticing that today.
Here's a thread where a couple people offer some theories:
There are several other threads where people are asking similar questions, but no answers that really tell me what I should do differently with the new information.

You confused me when you started typing "Coincase" instead of "Coinbase." I started to wonder if Coincase was some new, confusingly named iPhone wallet I hadn't heard of  :-o

They seemed cool to me.
Before I realized the difference between the subreddits, I posted to r/btc, thinking I was posting to a Bitcoin group:
I got cool and helpful replies, along with one guy mentioning:
"As an aside for a new member of the community, this sub advocates for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) which is a different coin than the original Bitcoin now..."

Thanks for the reply.
I don't intend to keep any coins "on Coinbase" longterm. (Most of them are headed to a Ledger Nano S). But I'm thinking that for the sake of this little test, having the coins sent to a Coinbase address isn't a dealbreaker.
On the one hand, I'm not sure I want to spend time installing and learning, say, Breadwallet, backing up my recovery phrase, etc.
On the other hand, if I'm really doing all this as part of a "test," then maybe the Breadwallet work should be part of that test...?
In either case... Whether I have Breadwallet (and its ability to easily display a QR code) or just Coinbase (and a public address I can text to the guy while we're at Starbucks)...
Are there any special instructions I need to give to the buyer before we meet? And... 
Should we expect to sit together for 20 minutes while we wait, or is there an earlier confirmation that will tell us the deal is solid?

This was my thought as well, without the "people suck" at the end :-)
What made the OP take it upon himself to "convince" these "very, very wealthy people" to invest in something?  Why try for so long that he says he "finally" convinced them?
Heck, what makes him so sure that giving the "best advice possible" will cause them *not* to "shy away?" – Especially to the point that he's afraid of them talking to a broker? 
I think I agree with salmon_flavour: "Give people the info but never force it."

Thanks for the reply, and I like your thinking...  but for this question, the whole point is to save the friend from the hassle of signing up with Coinbase.

I wonder if you can convert BTC to USD at Coinbase for their $4299 price, while waiting to see what happens with the rest of the market.
When they finally get back in sync with the rest of the market, you can buy back, and you'll have made a profit whether Coinbase finally got down to $4067 or the market finally came back up to Coinbase's price... wouldn't you?

Can you explain what you mean by "bump off?"
That sounds like we're a room full of gangsters, and you're suggesting that we go kill 5000.   :-)

Is it really "10%" you're after? Or some specific amount you'd like to buy at?
I ask because you could place a $500 limit order on GDAX, but the way you're describing would have you doing an automatic buy on a day that Bitcoin shoots up 10%, then turns right around. 
Well 11.1%, but you get the idea. :-)
Or are you thinking that any price Bitcoin hits, it'll hit again, and you want to buy it for 10% off that price?
