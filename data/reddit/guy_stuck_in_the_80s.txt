Welcome to the internet friend! 
I'm waiting for a nice misleading article title like this: 
"Is Berkshire Hathaway secretly buying up all the bitcoin?" 
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:20:18
I think it would be them hacking individuals wallets and stealing, then claiming there is a regulated 'better' crypto... 
It would most likely backfire, causing most people to move to a monero or dash-like alt currency though rather than government backed one.

You can't be this naive. The IMF sanctions against Russia alone should tell you how governments collude against a common enemy. The ruble still hasn't recovered. 
What do you think the G7 meetings are about? 
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:31:29
Maybe Americans are buying for the Chinese... 
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:05:22
Nations like the US and Israel collude on issues like stopping the Iran nuclear program. It's obviously in their best interest to do so. That is what the whole stuxnet virus was about a few years ago that infected almost everyone's computers. 
Look at the 2008 housing crisis and how it affected every other countries financial institutions. Since other financial markets are tied to USD, it obviously has an effect on everyone's currency. If something could push citizens off of USD and onto something like bitcoin, there would definitely be collusion within the finance world to get governments to stop it.

If winkelvii dropped their 1billion coins, Im pretty sure there wouldnt be enough buy orders to keep it up there.

bity, bitit, belgacoin or wallofcoins appear to be options Germans can use. Two of them require only a phone number, the other two don't ask for any personal info it appears. 
Mycelium is similar to localbitcoins, not really sure how large that community is. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:59:09
once whatever CAD-coin becomes is close to release there will probably be similar steps taken. 
It was supposedly just a 'test' they were doing and nothing further is planned with this... yeah right. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:39:59
but we can buy more when it drops... 
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:12:53
Good. Some of us want to buy below 1k again thank you very much.

So theoretically speaking,... if a group of nations (that currently control the western banking world) wanted to collude and take down the BTC network of transactions, this would be impossible or improbable? Serious question here as I know its 'supposed' to be impossible but they have vast resources and a need to maintain control obviously.  
It's almost a given they will try to drop the network, claiming it is a hack by 'hated nation  at the moment.' Once they have their 'better' alternative to bitcoin that they can make 'safe' for people. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:45:06
Hope ALL the speculators dump it and we can buy at $400 again. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:48:06

It's actually like an exchange it seems. You fund your ["coinme wallet"]( with cash and then transfer from their wallet to others.
I *want* to like this concept but it seems like such a process to fund this with cash when you could just use a credit card or wire  at any exchange online. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 07:12:35


I don't think most people holding bitcoin believe this. It doesn't have to be a one or the other currency for it to succeed. Fiat works well and everyone understands it.
Personally, I like the idea of travelling and trading BTC for local currency or hopefully just being able to purchase with BTC (or another crypto) anywhere. Hate having the hassle of converting currency, bank fee's for doing it, transaction fee's for being out of country using a credit card etc... 
@_date: 2017-01-06 06:00:55
use an exchange that offers stop loss...

Im sure some do but there must be merchants that wait until the next boom cycle and then cause the drop to be that much worse. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:43:08
Rumor (that I just made up) is that the Chinese government has been the one causing the recent bump. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 04:04:33
They could pass part of the merchant fee they don't pay to credit card companies to customers paying in btc. 
One of the services that offer BTC merchant solutions should really think of adding this as a feature. Just ask the merchant if they want to deduct part of the fee they would *normally* pay and if they want to show that at the point of sale to the customer. 
Especially if this were advertised by online merchants, the cost difference between paying with credit card or BTC, people would come into the system and use BTC more just because it's cheaper. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 04:46:57


This is just a lie. Bodog owns Bovada and they are one of the first and largest sportsbooks still. They don't have issues with paying players back. 
Checks used to get delayed and backlogged because of the US banking laws they had to get around until Bitcoin became everyone's payment choice. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 06:24:15
Bet you it drops again this week. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 05:33:46


Didn't say they had to.
Merchants can just use the blockchain API to create a new address for transactions already to avoid fees and their are a dozen alternatives. Coinjar, bitpagos, bips, gocoin and moolah all do the same thing and some offer BTC and Credit Card solutions for merchants that have neither. 
It's only a matter of time before there is open source solution available that is easy for merchants to add and no % of transaction fee's at all. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 08:15:01
Well they've had a few thousand players betting at every hour of the day for over a decade, but I guess googling as you suggested really puts any argument to shame. 
Ever heard of liars on the internet? Or people trying to commit fraud on a gambling site then lying on a forum to get attention? It might sound crazy but these things happen a lot. 
Pinnacle however does offer better lines, from my understanding, than any of them. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:55:22
To be a global currency free of government regulations and market interventions. (My understanding anyways) 
It still has a lot of potential of becoming that even if a government tries to ban it because every other country in the world would still allow it. And people within 'banned' countries who have the internet could still use bitcoin of course. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 19:37:44
Decentralized movies aren't a 'thing' 
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:19:52


Bit of a stretch to make your point but ok you're correct. 
One government could initially try to "ban" bitcoin, creating scarcity within that country. If it is only one country that tried to 'ban' it, then within that country, bitcoin would cost more to purchase. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:45:52
Chillll it is down for everyone at the moment 
@_date: 2017-01-03 01:42:53

Because carrying cash is convenient as hell.. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 05:59:58
That's for the noobs and bitcoin haters though. What about merchants that just want BTC and to send the product? 
It isn't difficult to hold bitcoin and transfer out of any exchange into your bank account monthly. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 06:27:01
US accounts for less than 5% of the world population though. 
If every country but the USA were to leave it 'legal,' it would still have very strong world currency potential. People in the US would still hold BTC, but on a much smaller scale than other countries.  
Take the opposite situation with China. If they made it illegal, the US holders of BTC wouldn't ALL leave but some definitely would once that were announced. People in China would still move Yuan into BTC, they are doing it now because their currency is expected to drop against the USD even more soon.

Always near a starbucks... 
@_date: 2017-01-24 07:21:42
Or the US could take the stance that only communists would outlaw something like bitcoin and western adoption increases. Both scenarios are equally likely. 


The war on drugs started in the 80's and hasn't done anything to slow down people getting high in America. If bitcoin goes the same way, it would literally be digital gold. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 05:04:28


You can walk into a store and buy a loaf of bread though with the swipe of a card. 
As Xapo [pointed out here]( the BTC held in users vault is insured. It looks like a prepaid card really, except you can probably transfer out of your 'credit card' wallet into the vault if you want. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 00:54:11
And interesting imo. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 05:00:15
Appreciate the links and info (total noob on this).
It should be possible, down the road, for someone to have a credit card that users could go from BTC wallet to Visa/MC transactions?  
Avoiding bitpay only because visa debits are basically available at any bank. If one could go from BTC to anonymous credit card transaction, that would be the real game changer. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:51:56
They couldn't enforce it though.  
They could stop exchanges, people would run illegal ones (higher price too if you're selling something illegal).
They could stop US businesses from accepting that form of payment. 
Individuals could still hold, trade and buy things with bitcoin from inside the US though. They'd need to stop the internet. Which I wouldn't put above them trying (for many reasons) but very difficult to actually do. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 08:14:59
No because the environment he is speaking of is one where you've already seen the currency drop 20-40% against others. If you don't change to SOMETHING other than your local currency you could be holding useless paper and starving. 
Examples include: 
The Argentinian Peso in the 80's. 
The Peruvian Inti 1985-91
And the many near crashes nations currencies continually seem to go through. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 08:02:45
It's the dogecoin of news, if you will...
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:39:15
But you still have current holders of it that would be affected. And how they are affected has consequences to the government. 
There was the whole 'turn in your gold' thing in the 30's. People who would have held, obviously would have been wealthier than having to cash it in as the government demanded.  
@_date: 2017-01-24 07:32:55
Nice that you got down voted for giving the correct answer. 
Especially in you would think people understand that value obviously increases once scarcity is added from 'banning' something. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 04:47:33
It's easier to setup and costs them less, if not the same. Bitpay is no trasaction costs for 30 transactions a month up to 10k a year, then the 1% fee kicks in. 
It is probably not a significant enough amount though that the fee sharing would make a huge effect on sales though you're right.

@_date: 2017-01-24 02:19:42
All of the US residents, hedge funds and companies that use banks outside of the US could still participate though. 
Plus all of the current hodler's would be stuck hodling or spending BTC for things outside the US. Just another swing on the volatile bitcoin playground.

@_date: 2017-01-24 02:28:38
Streisand effect though. If China or US banned it, you bet your ass Im buying on that downswing after missing the last one. 
Sure an exchange may be down, but I can still get BTC transferred from friends outside the country in exchange for other currencies, goods or services anytime. 


You almost answered your own question there. Why don't they stop the torrent sites that steal all the pirated media? It is the same logic as when they shut down napster, there were already 3 or 4 better options with pirated media when they 'banned' napster. 
Ban Bitcoin, people just move to one of the hundred other crypto currencies or find different ways to get it without 'legal exchanges.'
