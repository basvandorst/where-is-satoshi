I know some people who say "blockchain but not bitcoin" and believe its a ponzi scheme. I have also said it, but not for same reason. I bought and sold all my btc in 2013 and said, "I don't know which crypto will be the one, btc or other" so I missed out on profits. I got into btc because i saw the epic spike in 2013 coming days in advance, and wanted to buy, but couldnt buy easily in time to trade the spike. However, once i was able to buy (on mtgox, of course) i could sell btc to others for a small profit. I'm currently allin , but my beliefs are the same. I'm not all in for any emotion, but rather because the low 6ks represented a very attractive trade setup, which as a speculator, I have to take. The recent 6k dip, and the 2013 spike are among the top 8 trade setups ive lived through so far. I still don't believe btc is a ponzi, but I also still believe there's no reason for its price to be here and not either .0000001 or 1000000 times what it is. Its not valuable like other instruments are, by measures like supply and demand, or usefulness, or productivity. Its tradable just like every other instrument because it follows the same occassionally-predictable patterns of human behavior.

Not sure I understand what you mean.

it is not valuable like other instruments, I did not say it's not value-ous. it has value, but no one can assign its value the ways I listed, the ways value is assigned to other instruments. you take the definition of valuable to be value-ous or value-ful, but i clearly mean value-able, as i listed ways of assigning value to instruments in the same sentence.
noone invests in crypto, because it is not an investment. i am a speculator, and speculate in crypto and many other games.
if you examine investment, and i suggest benjamin graham's books, then you will see that most cryptos today, certainly all the leading ones, do not meet the definition of investment.
