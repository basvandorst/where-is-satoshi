'Satoshi's Bitcoin' client aims to do this, a complete fork in place. It seems like what Satoshi meant when he said to 'fork the code' but the word hardfork has been corrupted to a negative one.
I haven't seen any postings about that story in this subreddit, I don't think it is allowed which is a real shame as I used to be able to get all my Bitcoin news in this subreddit but now it is only Core client related.

The 'civil war' is a debate about how to go about scaling the system, some say there are no risks to increasing the limit a little now, others disagree; that is all there is to that.
Any implications of one camp or the other wanting to hurt bitcoin is nonesense, most have btc best interests in their interests, some small groups may be trying to manipulate community opinion or be bad actors but that is only a small subset of people
@_date: 2016-04-14 15:25:41
Here I disagree, I think the community *thought* were would increase the block size when we got close, as that is what Satoshi suggested to do when the 'problem' arose. Then the 'problem' became apparent it would be a problem sooner than later and yet the solution Satoshi suggested, that the community was on board with was never implemented. ( Not his idea specifically but the idea that the block limit would never be a barrier).
The community, I for one and others I know who have been into Bitcoin for years, feel betrayed.
That's why I am upset. I see fearmongers and insults but very few technical discussion, and the ones I have seen showa small block size increase would be fine right now.

Coudl you share your RES tags? I accidentally deleted all mine a year ago.
Aside from that I think it is obvious this post was broken into 5 parts to reach to most users, and I think it's obvious this topic has a 'anti-core' edge, as it sounds like someone who was snubbed by them wrote it. 
I notice a huge amount of the accounts within the last 6 months praise Core at every turn  often at the expense of others, yet seem completely uninformed on how Bitcoin actually works. I also see some accounts that almost have to be bots, nonsense word strings that often don't make any sense no matter what native language one had. I also have seen first hand many comments that are here one minute and gone at the end of the day. so the removal of comments is certainly ongoing (many not breaking any rules at all; it is likely that this very comment of mine will be removed, not for breaking any rules but for bringing attention to the removal of valid comments).
It is clear there are bots and paid users, their allegiance is of more question. However considering who they badmouth, the method of their adhomenin attacks, changing the topic when proven wrong, and other obvious troll behavior (often reported and allowed or unremoved by the mods) leads me to some conclusions. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 00:10:31

This is on his blog,
"The signature format used within bitcoin is based on DER encoding. Other methods have been applied in the original code has changed significantly in the last seven years. "
That doesn't seem grammatically correct and for all Satoshi had going for him proofreading his comments seemed to be there.

I've been thinking it is far more likely Todd or Dashjr are 'unofficial' agents. They are exactly the type of people the NSA/CIA would employ off the books and they moved in to swoop power away from Gavin years ago and have been hounding to strip him of remaining power for a year.
It seems far more likely to me that some of the core devs are secret plants.
@_date: 2016-05-02 23:53:47
To say attacks is misleading and perhaps ignorant on your part. There was never an opportunity for anything contentious, the majority of the network would have to have agreed to use it. 
There were never any attacks, trying to bring competing implementations is not an attack

I think more people will as btc grows in popularity and also exchange rate. 
Do you think *everyone* should *be able to* run a full node?
 I think this is a new idea that is not inline with the original vision of btc and doesn't make sense from a technical point of view. But it is interesting to hear actual reasonable and logical points on the matter.

it is in the generation tx or coinbase reward; the first tx in a block is one miners make to themselves to receive the coinbase reward. In that tx there is the extra nonce and some arbitrary data, that is the location of the data

This I will say I think I disagree with. Bitcoin was explained to people in a way that the data cap was never an issue, we may bump agsinst it but we would never be pressed against it. Satoshi spelled out that the data cap would raise when it got too close, people accepted that as what we would do. Then when it came time to do it the devs said that was never the plan, many feel betrayed at this change.
Bitcoin was not designed as a system to operate with full blocks, a system may be made that does this, but it is not the Bitcoin system envisioned and explained by Satoshi. I am not appealing to authority here, this is a mindset that many people had which was suddenly yanked out from under them. I think this is a huge part of why long time users especially are upset at the actions of the Core client devs.

This is a true fact that the likes of Todd and dashjr will have to accept.
Everyone has their own limits for 'spam', and Satoshi was quite clear with his opinion that the option for no fee txs should always remain, though they not be quickly or at all confirmed.

But I am curious as to how you think this could actually happen. From reading everything bitcoin I can all day long for 3 years I personally feel the core devs have turned away from the Bitcoin described in the whitepaper; and that they are the ones potentially compromised.
Although it is certianly possible Gavin &amp; Craig are been coerced I wonder what th eend goal could be?

As long as we are never pressed against the limit we'll be fine, we are in danger of getting too full but haven't reached saturation yet, all camps will be fine if scaling can keep up with demand (ignoring the developers et all that have said btc would be more popular with business if it could do far more trades)
