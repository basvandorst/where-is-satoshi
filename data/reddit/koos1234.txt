The resistance at 2900 was higher than 3000, probably again so with 3900. If we break that it could easily bump to 4300$

Just wait, considering this is an All Time High the volume is extremely high.
Unconfirmed parents are not rare, multiple people experience that at these times

Okay, let's tackle this properly and quasi-formally on a deterministic way (we don't use probability / measure theory or stochastic calculus). 
First we assume that the Bitcoin USD price P(t) goes exponentially like P(t)=Exp(t) with t the time in years since 2009. We're in 2017, so t=8 and according to this model P(8)=Exp(8)~$3000, so the current price is higher in fact. But this model is obviously very crude and serves only to simplify calculations.
Next we assume that you can invest on avarage 75$ per week, or equivalently 75$ per ~1/52 year.
Your goal is to acquire 0.25 Bitcoin. 
The total amount of Bitcoin you will have acquired after N weeks is equal to Sum(75/Exp(8+i/52), {i,1,N}). 
(So the lower limit of the sum is 1 and the upper limit N, you might want to verify this for yourself.)
Solving the equation for 0.25 yields N~11.1 weeks, so after about 11 weeks you will own one full bitcoin :)
However, because the bitcoin price goes exponentially, you will only ever be able to acquire ~1.3 bitcoin, assuming you continue to earn 75$ a week, and assuming you live forever (the sum converges to 1.3 in the limit N-&gt;infinity).
That means you will be the proud owner of  about 2.05 bitcoin at the final days of the universe.

No, anything substantially more than the common transaction fee of 1$ is fine. So even 10$ is fine.

You should know the difference between wallets and exchanges.
Exchanges are online websites that keep the bitcoins for you. In other words, you have acces to them, but don't control them.
Wallets are either software wallets like Electrum or Hardware wallets like Trezor, or even paper wallets with just a private key. Having your bitcoin in a wallet ensures you control them and is thus recommended.
If you just want to trade small amounts of Bitcoin an exchange like Coinbase or Kraken is fine. Keep large amounts on wallets though.

No, if the Bitcoin price would go as f(x)=x, then the inverse would be g(x)=1/x, not g(x)=c-x with c a constant as in the picture.

1) Keep your private keys / wallet words on a piece of paper in 2 or maybe 3 separate locations, with only you knowing which locations. Don't give any explanation on the paper, just state the key/words.
2) Should the price fall 50% or more tomorrow, don't sell, just hodl and continue with your life. Bitcoin has seen far worse (for example the 2013 crash and Mt Gox bear market)

It's fine, the volume is extremely high right now and you probably haven't payed enough fees to be top-priority in the waiting queue. Just wait a another 24 hours, the situation is not time-dependent.
Btw, unconfirmed parent also has something to do with verification and will disappear after enough time

You can store Bitcoin either on an exchange like Coinbase or Kraken or whatever or a wallet.
The former is easier and noob-friendly and the latter saver.
So just go to Coinbase, deposit some USD bucks and buy Bitcoin. Your bitcoin will then be stored on Coinbase and you will have acces to them, for example you could sell them or withdraw them to a wallet should you wish to do so later.

We're not in a bubble because the mainstream media keeps warning people for years now that we're in a bubble
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:11:57
If the program is open-source just keeping the wallet words is enough, (you don't need to write the cryptic tons of private keys that go like S93Dm218dfsadf.....123D298ff and those kind).
Coinomi is open-source but I'd still consider switching over to Electrum because that one is very trusted according to many people
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:17:04
In 2011 you could get them at Mt. Gox
But if you do travel back, make sure to store them in Bitcoin QT right away after you buy them

Plotting exponentially non-linear functions in logarithmic charts (i.e. exp(f(x)) where f(x) is not of the form ax+b) makes the chart very non-intuitive and it would in that case be better to just plot the linear chart

If you ever feel sad, read the topic of Stone Man: 
He lost 8999 Bitcoins in 2010, which is about $35,000,000 right now.
The adress: 
(If you find the private keys, pm me :P)

Fee is incredibly small, so just wait.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:54:35
yeah let's do an ico and call it pornerium
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:32:22
Ah, I get it now, thanks
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:53:49
Link them to a mainstream article about Bitcoin (preferably one that mentions Coinbase) and if necessary let them call Coinbase customer support.
If they continue to act like close-minded idiots, put the 1200$ into Bitcoin, store the private keys in a secret place and never talk to them about it again
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:14:56
yeah spread the FUD that's just what we need
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:25:12
A wallet is a software program, like Electrum, that stores your private keys. That means you control the keys. An exchange on the other hand keeps your private key for you.
You can withdraw bitcoin from an exchange to a wallet, or sell the bitcoin on the exchange for USD, whenever you wish.

The predicted value of 1 BTC at the end of the year will be 1 BTC.
Now think about that, and the underlying motives of Bitcoin, if you will.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:49:03
Yeah, he lost it by sending it to a wrong adress of which no one has the private keys.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:26:34
Yeah I was just having a bit of fun.
You could easily implement that limit with  P(t)=Exp(t+c*t^2 ) with c being a very small negative constant, for example -0.02, and then let the domain end at the critical value of the price (to make sure the higher power in the exponent doesn't lower the price)
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:44:48
I told you it was coming!
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:04:13
So if you don't plan to send or receive Bitcoins before the chains merge, you can just hold on to your Electrum Bitcoins and wait until they merge?
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:25:08
So if you don't run a full node your coins will be wiped out? I think that's bullshit. If you have your coins on Electrum for example and don't do any transactions after July 31 until the situation is clear, your coins should be save, right? Even in the unlikely case of a hard fork you should have your coins on both chains. Or am I missing something?
