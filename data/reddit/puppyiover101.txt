You're oblivious if you believe that we actually trade 50x that. Ever heard of wash trading?

What about the Dodgecoin and litecoin? Thanks. I noticed that electrum isn't online. How does it work then :0

Allright thanks. One last question--&gt;Since I already fked up and switched to block.io, I lost $3 in fees or w/e. I made an Electrum but idk where to find the wallet(s) I have :/
Which of them are mine? Do I use the one in Recieve or Addresses. And in Address do I use change or receiving? Thanks

What are scams? Online wallets? Or are litecoin and dogecoin scams? Also, is the electrum bitcoin wallet on Android legit too? I wanna use it on my pc and phone. Thanks.

Do I need to use the request tab to request money? Or can I pick one of my wallets

Claim all the "legit" bitcoin forks. BCH, BTG, BCD, BTCP. Easy money.
