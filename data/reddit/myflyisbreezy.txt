I agree. To most, bitcoin is going to be "that thing criminals use to do business" for a long time.
The way i see it, a lot of people would have never been exposed to bitcoin if it weren't for the online drug market. 
The same features that make bitcoin useful for black market purchases also make it useful for normal stuff.

@_date: 2017-08-17 16:56:41
I assume if that ever happens ($1m+), bitcoin will still be useful for large transactions, and litecoin will serve the purpose of pocket cash. So you buy cars and houses with BTC, and everyday purchases with LTC

how do you do something like that in electrum? it only gives the option to replace by fee, and doesn't let you initiate a double spend.
