Escrow was put in place so only a certain amount are released at a time. If the price is desirable more power to me. Did anyone see the crazy Twitter campaign ripple put out during the xrp pump. They have a dirty team and will soon take over. They just want to brain wash everyone with the fastest speeds and lowest fees poster. Guess what, of the top 5 coins rn. They are the cheapest and fastest to send. A market can’t survive with the  asset working at a lower level then those below it. Even ltc is better LOL

Just catch the prices at the bottom and take profits. Its a bear trap right now.

It should be spammed. It may only drop to 10k but a drop is coming. Why not sell now and buy at a better position. Maybe the truth hurts BTC. Slower and more fees, then LTC and XRP. Can’t be  forever unless they can scale asap.

Gunna regret that the whole ride up to $100,000

Even better. I can’t wait to buy XRP at a low.

Sorry. Im a math guy.  13k&gt;10k=sell today

Bitcoin is predicted to hit 10k. It is possible for it to breakout. But more likely we will continue to see a drop. How significant. Who knows its crypto

I don’t. If i could make an account and have the funds deposited in the next 6 hours I would short btc this whole week.
