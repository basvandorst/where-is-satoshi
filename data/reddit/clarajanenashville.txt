Something like this, minus the illegal underworld stuff...

Thanks, looking into it now...

Thanks, I really wish I’d never allowed the demo content on the site in the first place... hunting down all the content has been tough, every time I think I’ve got it all, more pops up!

Thanks :) I’m really excited about it... got our first order paid via BTC last night!! 
@_date: 2019-03-06 22:58:54
That wasn’t anywhere as easy to setup as GoUrl was, but I got it done! 
We’re now accepting BTC using BTCPay... thanks for the suggestion :)

Thanks for the heads up! What browser are you using? 
@_date: 2019-03-07 20:20:56
I did a quick google search and didn’t find anything... got a link?
@_date: 2019-11-30 11:49:52
That works, thanks!

It sounds like you could really use a CBD joint and a hug!
Here's a few studies I found on Pub Med (these are just a few from the first page of 10,979 results when you [search for CBD](
[Generalized CBD Study](


[Cancer Treatment](


[Breast Cancer](






[Drug Addiction](


[General Safety](


When CBD was taken with a high-fat meal, its bioavailability increased by approximately four- to fivefold and, as such, administering CBD with food would maximize bioavailability and likely reduce within-day fluctuation in systemic exposure to drug.
All adverse events were of mild or moderate severity.
Safety data are consistent with the currently established safety profile of CBD.
[Multiple Sclerosis](




The short answer is that it does a hell of a lot. 
On a personal note, CBD has been just short of life changing for me. It turns the volume down on my anxiety and allows me to truly be myself in situations that used to fill me with almost debilitating anxiety (situations that I used to lean on my prescribed Xanax to get through).
