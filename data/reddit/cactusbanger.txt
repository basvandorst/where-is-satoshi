If you got it off of Amazon or eBay throw it in the garbage.

It's an easy thing to post man. Can't go around claiming things without proof.

Stoked to see how much. Nice work dude! Hoping for the best for yoU!

Part of me just wants to buy a god damn coin outright and never look at this sub again.
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:52:54
Yes you read that right, I buy 250 Bitcoin every 2 weeks smh. I'll edit it just for you special guy.
@_date: 2019-06-18 16:00:55
Upped my 100 a week to 250.

As a former mechanic and current automotive engineer, this thing hurt my eyes and my heart. Jesus Christ, kill it, kill it with fire.

I've been to bakeries thousands of times and have never realized their true potential.
@_date: 2019-06-18 18:42:10
Use coinbase pro. It's free last I used it about a month ago.

Be like me, have Bitcoin and Weed Stocks

I'm not sure what you mean but I'm interested to know more. The reason I disagree currently is because I opened up 3 tabs, cashapp, coinbase and bitstamp. I put 50$ in each and reviewed each tab. Cashapp gave me the most BTC for my $50.
Not sure what you mean bud.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:52:44
I will check this out!

@_date: 2019-06-16 16:42:36
I usually spend 100$ a week on increasing my BTC position. I think the FOMO is getting to me because I'd like to go up to 500.

They must question why one mosque uses way more than another lol
NVM IT'S FAKE

As someone who HODLs crypto, but doesn't even know that much about it from a technical perspective, I always found BCash to be phony, and Roger Ver to be a douche. Maybe if he was a nice guy I'd think differently. He will never be king, and I'm not even a die hard BTC guy.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:43:35
If most people had that issue reddit would know. Sounds like FUD to me from someone who doesn’t like twitter

BTC originally was developed on planet Vegeta, where Vegeta is actually the prince. But the original Ledger it was stored on was lost in the galaxy when Frieza had destroyed the planet. It was launched as an emergency right before the explosion, kind of like superman. The legend has it that it only ever made it to 8000. When Vegeta found out the ledger was discovered on planet earth, he went there and found that it had grown to over 9000, in which he got really scared and started yelling about it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:07:47
Lol you jinxed us! Pulled back 1000$ last twenty min

I’d like to know why also
@_date: 2019-06-16 10:40:55
OP getting a lot of hate. Pics like these motivate me to invest my money even harder and wiser.
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:26:53
X2. But I would use the pro version. Use limit orders and there are no fees.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:32:13
Super nice without fees. Instead of doing big 250-500 clumps every week I can DCA day by day
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:21:14
If you couldn't get the actual Bitcoin plate I wouldn't have bothered.
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:59:04
That depends on how many BTC you have.
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:38:47
Spring 17, before the rush. Thanks to Dennis Rodman actually, he was on TV shilling for potcoin (a huge failure), but he got me into bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:31:00
Roughly 100$ a week.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:13:22
All I can tell you is for 50$ Coinbase and Bitstamp offered less.

Welcome to India, rape capital of the world.
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:38:16
Coinbase pro doesn't have fees on limit orders last I checked.
@_date: 2019-06-06 10:32:52
I didn't know you had to go through all this. I just always assumed you could give someone your wallet address as if you were sending and receiving as normal.
@_date: 2019-06-14 21:00:08
If you're in the US I like coinbase. Very user friendly, located in the US. Use coinbase pro to avoid fees. It's easy. Transfer everything to my ledger.
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:33:19
I hold BTC &amp; XRP (not here to argue about the XRP).
The next major dip, I am buying enough BTC to round out to one full BTC, which I will HODL until death and pass on as a family heilroom.
*Little Johnny, before I go, please reach into my nightstand. Inside you will find a hollowed out Bible, which no one ever reads so it is my greatest hiding spot. Open it to page 69. The ledger nano is inside. The passcode is - is - is...*
*Grandpa! What is the password! What is it!?! What is this stupid list of words for? GRANDPA!*
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:00:35
Another possibility is someone could break into my house, kill me, steal the ledger and steal the secret words.
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:53:23
Better have your secret key then.
@_date: 2019-05-31 14:19:51
Haven't updated either.
@_date: 2019-05-31 14:19:13
Haven't ever updated mine. I plugged it in the other day, first time in 3 months, it stopped asking
