If nobody trades BTC, how are we supposed to know what they're worth?
*BTC is still a high risk investment*. It is not unreasonable for masses of people to treat it as such and react to price shifts in the way that they have. 
All currencies are traded internationally. Do you believe BTC should be different?

I completely agree, but I think that the rush of new BTC users that we will see are not looking for BTC so they can go on SilkRoad or buy something with BTC from any legitimate vendor. They look at the price, they hear the news stories, and they think "Hmmm, maybe I'll buy a few of those." 
Or maybe they'll buy a lot and get burned.
This was written to address that crowd.

I did not believe the recent price was sustainable. Obviously you cannot go from $50 to $70 without crystal clear market forces and not expect a change. But I have invested all of the dollars I can into this endeavor. However, I would like more bitcoins. So, when I find an opportunity to trade and buy on a drop, why not?

Well stating you were a day trader and then stating I'm getting emotionally attached to price like a day trader tells me you were probably not the best day trader. And again, if you read the whole thing you'd see that I'm not attached to the price or my emotions. That was basically the advice and conclusion of the post!
No idea what gobbledygook you're talking about with detaching myself from my mind for happiness...I'm talkin about bitcoins. But yeah, if I only had $500 to lose  should the price drop to $0 I wouldn't even think once about the price.

Well I can tell that we have different definitions of "almost exclusively", though I will agree that speculation is the main driver of price at the current time.
You didn't answer my questions though, so I will ask again:
1. If nobody trades BTC on exchanges, how are we supposed to know what they're worth?
2. Do you believe that BTC should not be traded in such a manner?

No, I don't meant to force you into any corner, I'm just trying to see exactly what you're getting at. You say traders hurt, and further say that bitcoin is not meant to be treated as a high risk investment, but for exchanging goods and services.
From your words, it is not unreasonable to think that you believe people should *not* be trading this high risk investment. That is why I asked the question. Furthermore, if you were to answer in the affirmative, I had the follow up question of how you would recommend we determine price. 
Again, I agree that speculation is the main driver of BTC price right now. Perhaps one could also make the argument that volatility tempers interest. If the price was suddenly rock solid at $65 and over a couple months 100,000,000 people started buying and spending bitcoins on the regular, could the network handle that?

I see we are in agreement. I edited OP to explicitly state my intent. A lot of this was inspired by the rapid cashouts that we saw on two separate occasions yesterday. I wanted to give a more eloquent and personal perspective than "Don't buy if you're so goddamned scared of the price after you do!"

Now that you're done calling me an idiot and a slave, if you read the whole post you'll note the paragraphs near the bottom where I talk about becoming more disconnected with the exchange rate and how the price doesn't matter as much to me anymore as it did when I first bought.
I don't know how long you have held BTC. I'm sure if I bought at $25 or $20 or $15 in January or fuck even anything under $40 I'd have no emotional investment in the price. I am speaking from the perspective of someone whose first major buy was above $50, advising those who are new to the scene of how they might feel and what they might expect. 
I applaud your ability to be so disconnected from the price that you can buy 100 BTC, realize an hour later that you could have bought 125, and not feel the tiniest bit of "Aw, shit!"
Man I can't even tell if you're joking or not, it's late.
