Why risk if you believe in bitcoin, shouldnt it be always a good time to buy
@_date: 2017-02-27 12:38:25
Gold and silver coins, food, water filters, medicine, guns, ammo, hunting skills, knive and lastly bitcoins, for when we survive the global collapse we will be millionares
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:51:10
Well if you understand economics even a little bit, you will know all those things u mentioned are inevitable.
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:13:26
It is the red pill
@_date: 2017-02-21 13:59:03
Well a dip seems inevitable doesnt it?
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:01:54
Yeap, as I stated, this is money I never thought would come, going in half tommorrow and waiting on ETF news with the other half.
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:10:29
But for someone who wants to buy a bigger amount, when could we expect a drop? Under 1000 possible?
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:11:36
I realized I need to start eating healthy and exercising, we dont want to be sick when we are millionares :)
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:10:16
Yeap, I always mention it, but they seem to be certain the dark lords aka big banks wont let it succeed. They always say you think banks wont want a cut of the action. Along the lines, a cornered rat is most dangerous. Banks will control it someday. Ignorant fucks
@_date: 2017-02-22 09:59:03
Well its a matter of when, not if
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:08:44
Valuable insight as always, thanks. I agree, the force is always with the good ones.
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:48:20
Nice one :)
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:49:20
Dude, yes, what are you so secretive about, pls dont use bitcoin for human traffic
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:54:58
Well its not as grim as you paint it. Besides we cant do anything about it. Although ETF mightq not be the best move for BTC, we need to be seen in official circles as a legitimate asset, and we need that big money to skyrocket.
Personally, I have a gut feeling this ETF will pass by default, there is just something in the air.
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:14:55
No, I will buy 30 or more
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:18:28
Hahaha, nice one
@_date: 2017-02-21 14:03:36
I agree, also ETF is highly unlikely so we might see a dip below 900$, who knows
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:38:55
You wont regret it, but diversify a bit.
@_date: 2017-02-27 13:12:03
No , I have 1/4 ounce, 1/2 ounce and 1 ounce gold coins
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:28:02
Agreed, Im sad most of my friends seem brainwashed, living a illusion and not thinkin of the future and not seeing the bigger picture. 
More wealth for us tho! I have everything in precious metals and bitcoin, and not afraid to lose it.
Im betting on humanity.
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:25:22
Yes but if it jumps to 3k or 5k, as it is always possible, I will have too much regret to deal with
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:44:03
Down or up isnt the real issue. More like succeed or fail.
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:19:01
Well if a bubble comes I want to have larger amounts avaliable, and who knows what can happen tommorrow, I will still buy each week a little, but go big in half before etf half after
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:59:51
What do you think are the odds of them succeeding ?
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:29:27
Lol, ofc
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:13:34
Well if you want to be in the long run, it doesnt matter at what price you buy at, it will bring profits amyway. Only if it fails, but if it fails then all hopes for humanity are gone.
As for now, Im sitting on a lot of cash, and a dip is soon to come, especially with ETFs coming up, expect it to dropa a few hunderd dollars, but it will correct in weeks.
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:56:58
When do you think it will dip again? Below 1000$ possible?
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:05:04
Good tips, appreciate it. I too think it will get rejected, as both the financial world and bitcoin itself are still not quite ready. More transactions might be a problem. But do you think the price can make such a huge drop?
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:54:17
Thanks for your insight !
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:52:31
Godamn, what is their plan 
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:31:41
"Bitcoin will get approved in a few hours"
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:34:57
Isnt Bitcoin Core heavily funded by banksters?
We need bitcoin to be ready for a collapse as soon as possible. It seems BU would make that possible quicker and cheaper. Then later we can implement everything else.
Did I get this right?
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:50:45
37 and hodl
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:24:07
Worth investing?
@_date: 2017-02-21 14:00:37
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:44:48
Quantum computing wont kill it
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:19:45
What is your problem. I welcome bans of bitcoin, they will only make it stronger.
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:00:25
Depends how shallow you are
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:37:59
Well mostly I fear a scenario where food and ammo will be most valuable :)
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:42:11
Ill never forget her old speech where she had a breakdown. It was probably then when her soul was begging her not to speak such massive lies.
Well, as they promised, they will raise the rates 3x this year by a quarter percent. Enough to get it started. 
Im afraid the collapse might be 2017/18. Godamn lets goooooo
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:09:45
I ate molly
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:23:06
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:24:44
Buy more xD
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:30:08
Tomato sauce
@_date: 2017-03-06 12:10:35
No one can see the future, but yes as more people get into bitcoin the price will rise. Hodl and enjoy
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:15:44
Chinas situtation, elections in Europe etc.
@_date: 2017-04-04 07:06:14
I think once the precious markets manipulation ends the prices will skyrocket.
Silver could easily outpreform everything since its so undervalued. Gold will be the world reserve at least for a while.
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:01:06
Is exodus viable ?
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:51:34
IOTA is meant for machine to machine payments, they are not competitors
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:05:06
Ok, thanks
For anyone wondering about exodus, here is how to export private keys:
