I wanted to buy at 18k, but glidera took a couple of days to review my account and it wasn’t approved until today. I still bought bitcoin, but I got them at 11k this morning instead. Plan on holding for at least a year.

I wanted to buy some Bitcoin on Monday when it was 17k, but glidera didn’t approve my account with bread wallet  until today. Thanks to their slowness I avoided buying that high and bought at 11k.

Yeah, he deserves Prison, maybe not a life sentence, but still he want a great guy. 
Also, he wasn’t as smart as he thought he was. He could have just started a market place using bitcoin and anonymous accounts like eBay started. He could have “suggested” not selling anything “illegal” in its terms of services and be public about it. He would have gotten the same results, but he could have deny and argue they can’t police all the internet, just like bigger companies like Facebook, google, and Craigslist do when shit goes down.
