Dude I had a $1000 in bitcoin on bitfloor, what the fuck.

All the chatter on the board points to this being the case. He had 25k BTC, or ~250k USD in the hot wallet. Absolutely no funds were kept in a cold wallet on an encrypted system.

He had 25k BTC, or ~250k USD, stolen right out from under him.

The thread on going on bitcointalk, DID YOU READ IT?

We see an on going discussion pointing out flaws in the story and flaws in the system. 
None the less I have placed a support email and have already recieved a response. Obviously not the response I'm looking for, but hopefully things will get resolved.
On the other hand, he is refusing ACH withdrawls on USD that is still being held on his system. So which is it, all the money, or just the coin? What gives?

I had my funds in bitcoin Sunday evening and I went to bed after my trade was completed. Labor day kept me busy, I log on this morning and viola, no funds, no account, no site. After some searching lead me to the answers (or lack thereof.)
I should in no way be penalized for trading, those funds should have been secure, whether it was in coin or USD.

It hurts the community because members like me who trade and use the service get fucked out of our money. 
EDIT; but honestly, I'm just angry right now. So don't mind me. :P

Fuck that I lost a grand in bitcoins. That is never coming back. Roman is a cheap con.

Don't think we will ever let this go, I will never support anything he works on or becomes involved in.
