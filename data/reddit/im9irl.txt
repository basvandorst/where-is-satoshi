I used changelly to convert BTC to Stellar Lumens almost 4 days ago.  It took almost 3 days just for the BTC transaction to be processed in the blockchain, and now Changelly has been stuck at 'transferring to my wallet.' 
It normally doesn't take this long after the funds are confirmed sent, but support just says Welp, the networks are really backed up. They did tell me the exact amount I can expect, but 15+ hours now waiting for them to put my Lumens in my wallet.

I feel you man, I had a buddy tell me to invest in Ripple because he got in for pennies and it was at 25 cents when he told me.  The next night, I decided I'd look into actually getting some (first foray into altcoins) and by the time I woke up the next day, it was skyrocketing! 
I took a risk and got in at about 45 cents and have held strong, totally amazed at it hitting 1.25 when BTC was plummeting. I exchanged ~$585 worth of BTC/LTC, and right now it's worth nearly $1600.  I'm going to hodl any coins I come into, but I'd also be interested in the feedback to trilll's question.

I've used them many times, so I'm not too worried.  I'll see how this goes, but I'll probably use a different service in the future and would advise people not to use them again until this is all sorted out.

Just posting to update that I heard back from coinswitch.io's support team regarding the holdup with my BTC to XLM exchange through Changelly.  
Their full and verbatim response was "Currently the exchange don't have enough supply I think."

How about NEO? I've also looked into NEO, but was also thinking about NEO. Any thoughts on NEO?

If you sell before the dip and buy back in after, is that taxable?  
For example, I'm selling on Coinbase and having USD put into my account's wallet, then using those same funds to buy more BTC.  
Or is it just when I cash out and transfer my gains into my bank account?

Just wanted to update that my Stellar Lumens were finally deposited today after a bunch of back and forth and talk about failed transactions.  But every single Lumen is received and accounted for!

Many people (sheeple) around here look to Andreas Antonopoulos as some kind of guru around here, but this guy really doesn't know anything and they drank the Kool-Aid anyways.  
I can see you've had some trouble getting some real feedback, no sweat, us Info War guys gotta stick together.  That said, I'm stunned you didn't watch Alex break this crypto thing down in a recent series of enlightening videos.  Here's the first one to get you started!
