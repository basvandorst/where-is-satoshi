Oh boy.. this is some scary shit. Sorry for your loss. Be your own bank is not easy. But i can't understand how can you keep $250k worth of btc in your regular wallet and walk around with it just like that. Did you hear stories about people who lost their wallets on the street? Jeez.. no passphrase.. it will be even safer to walk around with trezor itself. Lesson for today: Keep your seed in safe guys. Use passphrase.
