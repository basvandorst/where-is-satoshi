I own 100+ BTC but I am not so sure on a house for 1 BTC. Maybe if there is a giant worldwide crash of economic systems. Still there is much larger players than I, and they can always cash out their 10k, 100k Bitcoins before me. Its an illusion to think they wait until you can buy a house for 1 BTC.

I remember you. You are this clown who keeps pushing shitcoins like ETH that lost you up to 95% of your money. Even now, ETH is down 80% from its ATH. There is barely any practical use for ETH, even Tron got more users in their illegal casinos already.

The possibilities are endless yeah. But all that is easily possible already we don't need crypto or block chain for it.

And still the illegal Casinos by Tron are much bigger than anything on ETH. I sold my ETH when they were at $1400.Had bought them at $10. If I had kept them, I would have lost 80% of my money as of now. You dont even make any sense. There is no mass adaption ever happening for eth unless you get extremely lucky. It just brought us shitty ICOs and buzzproducts nobody needs. ETH is the cancer of crypto.

That's amazing! I know the same is true for Hungary for example. You can get a good piece of land with a well and a house starting at below 1 BTC.
  
Did your friend get happy in the favelas (or wherever he moved?)?

Why would I care if some reddit clowns believe me or not? I just mentioned I have over 100 BTC because I was making the point that there is much larger whales than I who will always cash out at much smaller amounts to crash down the price, before you could ever get a house. However this may lead in the end to less individuals having huge amounts, which in the long run still might make 1 BTC extremely valueable.

What would be the use of this? Smart contracts and dApps seem like buzzwords, could you name some actually uses? Like the biggest dApp of all right now is an illegal casino, and its nothing special. And its not even on ETH. Its kind of like flashgames. That is the biggest dApp of crypto. Actually its even worse than the millions of games in Apple and Google stores. I like Altcoins because thats how I got filthy rich but at this point in time they should have a little bit more to show than emtpy promises and hype.

You think every bitcoin investor and holder is on reddit? Most probably have much better things to do and dont care for your gossip and daily distractions.

I agree. I have over 100 bitcoin and its mainly so I am prepared for the future and can help out friends and family (in this order). The price isn't important at all.

Come on bro, dont keep us waiting! You probably wasted all your BTC on crack and shroomz anyways! Also Bitcoin was like $400-$1000 back then if I remember correct so you probably wont have 583834 BTC lmao
