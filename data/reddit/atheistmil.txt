Supply inflation has nothing to do with price inflation. Prices will always go up irrespective of currency supply because inputs will go up - assuming you want a pay rise.
If bitcoin reaches the point of indivisiblity and effectively becomes deflationary then theres going to be a whole host of other problems.
@_date: 2019-07-19 13:16:54
If/when BTC becomes used as an actual currency it will suffer from price inflation same as every other currency because costs will change, people want salary increases etc.
Basically purchasing power will inflate away value over time until bitcoin can no longer be divided and then (a loooooong time away) the economy will have to use an alternative or become deflationary.
As much as I find bitcoin fascinating it blows my mind people are getting so over excited by what is ultimately a cute database. Oracle must be kicking themselves for missing this trick.

Do you honestly think that inflation vanishes because of BitCoin? If so, I have some really bad news for you.

But forex is also used for general trade, it's a hell of a lot more than wild speculation. People spend billions in usd and eur everyday, from bread in a local shop to ordering 5000 cars from Ford. 
Bitcoin? Well, not so much.
Dont get me wrong blockchain is an awesome tech that is going to change the world. Bitcoin is a bubble and if you're not sure then I've got some Tulips you might be interested in.

Sorry if i was unclear but i assumed you had some sense. A DLT is a database, yes i know that. The point I was, perhaps poorly, trying to make is that there are plenty of valid use cases where a DLT makes sense as opposed to say, SQL Server. 
Bitcoin, as a reference implementation is interesting. But it has many, many flaws which people are now trying to retroactively fix. 
Fwiw and just in case you wish to tell me i dont know what I'm talking about. I actually work with DLT implementations and have been a developer for over 15 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:48:56
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:09:34
Yes it is an inefficient way to build a database but thats not the objective of DLT. I presume you know that.
Actually, outside of banking there has been some great application of DLT in aerospace and property. That will only increase. 
Yes, hype has overblown things but that is true of every tech, from edison bulb to the IoT. 
As for bitcoin, no it wont vanish any time soon but it will be superseded by a better tech.

I've been aware of btc since the early days and actively work in industry using crypto solutions. Blockchain is awesome. I hold various amounts of crypto but dont bet my life on it.
But listening to people on the various crypto subs is like listening to flat earthers.

If its adopted as a regular currency it is the best investment ever as it is inherently deflationary.

Not really, it makes the assumption that bitcoin as it exists today will remain in its current form for generations. While I do support the emerging currencies I struggle to accept the first one will survive for generations with any loss in value. The near future is far too unpredictable.

I understand what you're saying, however I am envisaging a scenario where there is value in the information being public - which it currently isn't, and where there is a decent amount of compliance and legislation which isn't going to magic itself away and frankly if you're engaged in this transaction you're probably happy that the legal stuff is there.
I suppose you could reward mining independently of being able to transact,  but still require a form of authentication to do so.

I'm amused that you say bitcoin is "SOLID", from a tech perspective it's a cute trustless datastore that has a few flaws. In almost every use case for DLT/Blockchain there are better solutions than to use DLT.

I'm not a 100% clear what you're trying to argue but you're deluded if you think there is intrinsic value in bitcoin. A currency derives value from its ability to act as a means of exchange and because of (or occasionally in spite of) the economic policies that back it up. e.g. inflation targets. It is otherwise useless.
Gold has industrial and cosmetic applications and is relatively rare/expensive to extract for those uses, same as platinum, palladium and other metals. If you're looking for the "new" gold you'd be better investing in Helium-3 which we need a lot of but it is increasingly scarce.
Bitcoin - well blockchain - is an interesting tech that has a lot of use, but it is the concept of blockchain that is being used and developed in industry not bitcoin. BTC is proving only that the tech scales (kind of) but should a government of global consortia back a crypto then for mass adoption that'd probably win.
Yes, BTC and others may exist in a grey market but as a replacement for gold. Nope.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:45:07
Uhm no.
Money is an attempt at a standardised means of exchange. How many carrots is a TV worth? Etc.
All the fancy shit built on top of that is either clever application of maths with some social theory tacked on a.k.a economics or lots of bollocks.
Bitcoin or any other altcoin will have value so long as it used as a means of exchange. If you're trying to use it as a form of digital gold, well fine, but a few well placed EMPs could reduce that value to 0. At least gold has some use in the material world.
If i were you I'd watch developing economies more than advanced ones as chances are they will be the ones to shift to digital currency long before the west makes any serious inroad.
Also, for the nano-satoshis out there bitcoin is still a deflationary currency. This will result in ling term limitations, bitcoin is the Geocities of social media, roll on myspace!

It doesn't have to bring down Bitcoin, only sufficient such that a competing node(s) could take control for 51% of the network, even for a short-ish time it could do a lot of damage.
What can a government do if lots of people hold their wealth in bitcoin? It's a new form of economic warfare :-)

Money is one of many asset classes, each has its use. Hoarding money is not useful when money is used as a means of exchange. If you wish to store value, dont use money.

I can appreciate that you might not want to disclose this (pm me if you like) but what bank did you get to take your payments? 
I had hoped to launch an exchange and payment processor in the UK. Even got the FCA  stamp of indifference and had audit controls for kyc etc. However no UK  bank would touch us with a barge pole and we never launched.

I dont have any metrics to hand but I'd be curious to know why there is such a high charge back. There maybe many valid reasons for it. 


Fair point, and assuming one is buying perfectly legal goods why would one choose to pay with bitcoin if the consumer protection legislation is not equal to other payment methods? 
One of the things I *like* about paying by credit card is that beyond a certain value I am protected against fraud, non-delivery etc. As to my previous point, should bitcoin service providers develop a similar offering then whats the difference?


Not compelled, but it is much easier if there is a case of conflict, moreso if conducting business across borders. 


That has nothing to do with the rest of the chain regarding consumer legislation. I have amny reasons for my interest in bitcoin and alt currencies in general but as it stands they have major holes.

You do realise cash payment is non-reversible except by the process of consumer legislation? And the same could be made true for credit/debit card payments. Bitcoin doesn't offer anything new in this area.
And more to the point, when we do see bitcoin offer reversible system I'd not be to surprised if it doesn't end up in the same place we have cash/credit/debit card payments now. 
I can't see what problem you're trying to solve that benefits anyone other than rogue sellers. If I have to use an escrow service every time I pop to the supermarket then adopting bitcoin seems a lot less attractive, or at least what value does this method offer over Visa or Payal et al?
@_date: 2013-09-25 08:13:30
The benefits of bitcoin at the moment are somewhat limited. Had the person in the post paid by bitcoin how would they have claimed back their coins from BFL? 
Consumer law is lagging somewhat.
@_date: 2013-09-25 08:55:26
I'm all in favour of caveat emptor but we have consumer protection for a reason. History is littered with companies setting up and vanishing in to the ether with peoples money. And what of the case of the OP where he has paid for a product that will never be delivered?
