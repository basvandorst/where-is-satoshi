Don't forget to check his browser's history! Good luck, OP.

Am I the only one who's kinda giddy about this? I mean, I *can* buy more. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:34:24
Hoping for a speedy recovery, brotha!

hey its me ur fren

Hey don't expose my personal information!
Although I need a little picker-upper from time to time. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:53:38
That's why I don't really succumb to all the *hodl*ing pointlessly attitude. There has got to be something you are hodling for that sets the cap on how much until you're gonna let go.

It's the people's way of saying "*the power is in the proles.*"

Bitcoin ~~bottle caps~~ - the legal tender in the world of waste.

I had a stiff neck watching *yah boi* get paid.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:52:11
sugar we're going down.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:26:04
I know. Apparently I drew the ire of reddit. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:06:50
What are you guys hodling for? Surely there's a reason. I, for one, am simple guy. I will only let go if I am already able to buy a Submariner.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:25:10
New York Coins, huh? Well, that's what I'm trying to venture into. I'm looking to diversify. I'm looking at ether right now, but delayed exchanges in shapeshift worries me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:39:19
eks dee

[If we hodl on together, I know our dreams will never die...](
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:58:39
I 2nd this
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:08:51
How much is enough? Also, what are some of the things your are *hodl*ing for?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:33:52
Meh. It was promising at first but it kept on crashing on my trusty iPhone 4s. Then again, I still have the v9.something of the iOS which I don't plan on updating anytime soon. ***HODL***
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:11:56
I slept throughout the journey. Damn. I should've bought again at 10k

@_date: 2017-12-08 01:44:39
How do you pronounce it by the way? iPhone 'eks' or iPhone 'ten'? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:35:46
Thanks for your detailed response. Due to btc's recent behavior, I am exploring the idea of diversifying my coins. Which do you suggest?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:37:39
Ever feel that feeling when your net worth has just drastically changed in just a couple of months and you're all smiles inside but you can't tell anyone? Yup, that's me.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:58:37
I'll look into that, but that's not really my priority rn. As long as it can call, text, and browse the Internet, it stays.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:57:04
This looks so templated it makes me sick. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:57:58
Brazil, perhaps? His English is telling, too. No offense.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:04:48
Hell, why not even 30?
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:04:29
Do you guys have other altcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:59:22
Hodling for the Hodlex Hodlmariner.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:49:07
It's *Rickard and Mortimer* buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:08:55
I'm thinking of converting my remaining eth back to btc because it looks like eth is going nowhere. But then again, I've *hedl* it for like just a week, so yeah, lol. Haha. And, oh, fuck shapeshift.io's fees!
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:42:21
*Mason, these words... What do they mean?*
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:55:49
So is it any good?
