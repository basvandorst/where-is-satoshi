I can't do that, because I don't want to divulge my keys. But I can tell you that buying back at over $1,000 after selling at $300 was quite challenging mentally.

When I hear "a little compromise" in the context of the scaling debate it sounds no different to me than "a little centralization."

I think those Ethereum contracts are getting very expensive to operate with the recent price rise of ETH!

You're right that some if it I didn't piece together until later, but even in 2014 there was a now-noticable "big block campaign" and also a maligning of GMaxwell and other developers.

I could have gotten a better price if I spent more time working the order I guess. I put up the wall because I didn't want to just sit in front of the computer all day.

My understanding from reading the developers mailing list is that it is more than that. You have block verification time to take into account as well, and there's this thing with the cost of verifying digests going up quadratically with block size. Its not that simple.

"huge companies" are "getting into" their own private forks of Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:49:18
Really the easiest way is to just put up a limit order at a price you're comfortable with. A more difficult way is to "work" the order, sell small amounts over a period of time to not move the market. You could probably automate that with a program. Gemini has that daily private auction, it seems like a nice way to transact large amounts of coins without moving the price.

Like I said I am not completely knowledgeable on the game theoretics of the forks. But, I don't need to be to know that pushing for a hard fork within 6 months with no proposed code in hand is stupid.

The grave technical ignorance plainly displayed in the "Silbert Agreement" is so staggering in depth that I cannot fathom how they arrived at such conclusions.

Sounds like the perfect argument for why miners should signal SegWit voluntarily. And if they don't, then UASF.

Roger Ver shows the signs of being a con man. What exactly is he good at? He doesn't make anything, design anything, has no trade skills as far as I can detect. He's just good at running his mouth and gaining people's confidence.

I'm not sure what I will do in the case of a split, but I would naturally lean towards whatever is the better technical solution. A hard fork to larger block size is irresponsible and would lead to mining centralization. I support changes to prevent the use of ASCIBoost, covert or otherwise. I am strongly in favor of simply allowing SegWit to activate on its current 95% schedule, with no other code changes. What I do if there's a split depends entirely on how the split happens, availability of replay protection, and what exchanges will do. Also, depending on what support there is from hardware wallets. Its complicated :)
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:39:13
I believe Bitcoin is great and I will never sell again. I support Core and UASF. Roger Ver and Jihan Wu are bad actors who have caused billions of dollars worth of damage to the bitcoin ecosystem.

I'd rather not give out too many details, as I would like to remain anonymous. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:39:44
I can't really say because I'm not an expert on all the flavors of forks. I just know that SegWit needs to happen, the best way for it to happen is for miners to signal as currently implemented. And I feel the next best thing (although, as I said, I do not know enough to understand all of the political and economic changes of various methods of upgrading) would be a user activated soft fork or "UASF." These have happened in the past. It is an illusion to believe that miners control the network. A UASF is the best way to remind the miners that there is a balance which will be maintained one way or another. The only thing I find contentious is that we have vetted SegWit code proven to work on 7 other chains which is being held up by some miners.

1. Yes I followed bitcointalk, before and during. I did not buy a painting.
2. Yes exactly what you described. No IRS or police visits. I paid taxes on the gains. I wasn't nervous at all.
3. Because I trusted Bitstamp. My goal was to get the coins to move without 1) requiring too much manual intervention and 2) over a relatively short time period. It worked. I did not sell in panic. I just believed, incorrectly, in the "small blocks are bad" narrative.
4. Felt fine.
5. I saw the price go up to over $1,000 over a couple of years so I revisited my reasons for selling, and then I did research to make sure those reasons were valid. The biggest motivator for going back in to BTC was looking at the robust health of the GitHub repository. Lots of contributors, well thought out changes, a thorough code review process, and finally when I looked at the work that went into bitcoin since when I sold it became very clear to me that the story Roger Ver was pushing was completely false, and that the core development team and supporting folks around them are competent and well-intentioned.

* Propaganda campaign against core devs
* Manipulate people's emotions, e.g. "Satoshi's Vision"
* Acquire bitcoin.com to make it look like the "official" bitcoin site
* Use bitcoin.com to promote his mining pool and preferred wallets
* Pay sockpuppets to astroturf
* Disinformation campaign
I can't prove that his intentions are bad though. But the consequences of his actions have held back bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:10:46
The developers (including you) have done a great job improving  communication and transparency. We still have a little ways to go. But the biggest obstacle is the blockage of SegWit as a soft fork.

I never did like how Gavin Andresen had to go around begging with hat in hand to be paid to work on Bitcoin. I much prefer the current situation where there are a couple of for-profit companies, Blockstream included, whose business depends on Bitcoin being the most successful cryptocurrency. This way the smart people can get paid without the need to panhandle for "donations." And there is a financial incentive to do a great job.

I've learned a lot from carefully reading the core developers mailing list and the communications from the most active contributors to the bitcoin-core repository. Raising the block size limit is a last resort. All other technical solutions should be explored before raising the limit. The SegWit changes for starters. I'd like to see widespread lightning network deployment and its effects on transaction volumes. We really have no idea how the bitcoin economy will evolve in response to lightning network - making block size increase decisions today without that information seems reckless. Decentralization and stability are Bitcoin's biggest differentiators from other currencies and it needs to be preserved.
I find myself oddly agreeing with Luke-Jr when he says that even 1MB might be too large. He is prone to hyperbole but there's a kernel of truth there.
