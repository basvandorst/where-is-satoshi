Hot Glue on the USB? What? I died laughing.

Oh. The main reason I have this graphics card is because I got it for gaming. I will look into some ATI cards. Thanks (:
@_date: 2013-05-12 03:39:50
Yeah, but I have no idea how to buy in.
@_date: 2013-05-12 03:26:55
Okay. I'll check it out. Thanks (:

Good point. I usually mine in intervals of 1 or 2 hours though.
@_date: 2013-04-21 13:06:17
Yes, I understand. Besides mining, I have been looking for a part time job aswell.

I tried CUDA mining using GUIminer, and my hashrate went down to 45 - 47 MH/sec. Any ideas how to speed it up?
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:15:42
Any ideas how many MH/sec I will be getting with those miners?
@_date: 2013-04-20 18:21:57
Ill mess around with the CUDA miner. Thanks! Also, how much did that specific Radeon 7870 cost you?

Wow! That's great to hear! And I just don't know about ASICS being available and in stock so early. It seems as it will take them longer. Anyways, thanks for the advice nonetheless. You have inspired me (:

Very well then. I apologize. I didn't notice. Should I delete the post, or will you?
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:47:05
Thanks for the suggestion. I'll look into them. (:
@_date: 2013-05-02 01:32:06
Oh. haha. Thanks. Anyways, sorry about that. I didn't read the rules. It won't happen again.

I'm a teenager, and I have no idea how to do that. I'll look into it. Thanks (:

How much did it cost you?
