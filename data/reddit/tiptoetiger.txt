Thanks man!
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:22:29
Noted down. Good spot, I will fix this for v1.1. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:31:13
Thanks! Was a pretty cool experience :)

made in Unity, and yes I could of check in the simulator in hindsight, but sometimes the simulator can so different results to real devices. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:12:54
It is a standard feature in Unity! You just change the build target to either iOS or Android. Very easy to do, there is probs YouTube videos showing examples of how to do it. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:22:40
When lambo?
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:25:18
I didn't actually have an iPhone X to test on. Could I be cheeky and ask if you could send me a screenshot of the game on the X? 
No worries if you're too busy.
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:59:33
How much does that pay? 
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:38:55
Hi, yeah I totally get what you're saying. I think I am actually going to remove the screenshot saving function in a future update. As I bet the majority of people who actually share/save screenshots is very low. It's the first time I have actually tried to make a save feature and to implement it was quite easy. Android requires you to add the permission request inside the code otherwise the game crashes when the user tries to save the screenshot. I think the wording that Android use to ask the user for permission is very lacking in detail as you said. Hopefully it is something they can fix for the future. But I hear you man! I don't think anyone wants someone to have access to their personal stuff, it is certainly the hot topic right now and rightly so.

Slooooow doooooown
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:29:34


Haha amazing thanks! :D
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:22:48
Hey, sorry to hear that. What device are you using?
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:45:45
I have many hours spent on Trials HD as well, love that game. The difference is that I wanted the controls to be one touch. So people can play it while commuting using one hand.  
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:20:46
It doesn't at the moment. The tracks are static. But I am already in talks about implementing live track data. Watch this space! 
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:37:47
Hey man,
Thanks for the download! So it was coded in c# using Unity. And to be honest I have been coding in c# for just over 8 months? I had experience in Unity before but coding in Javascript, I mainly learnt to code in Xcode and Swift. There is so much learning material online for Unity, it is insane. I have learnt a lot doing this. Can't recommend it enough, 30 minutes a day here and there. You'll be surprised what you can make :)
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:29:31
Looking to do this for a future update!
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:43:38
Ooo interesting bug, I will have a look into it. Thanks a lot for the BTC. It is really appreciated :)
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:26:34
is that on Android? I will look into adding this for v1.1.
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:05:11
No worries man, obviously my rubbish game design :p
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:00:55
Thanks! Anything you’d like to see in a future update? 
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:53:17
Haha really brings it home doesn't it?
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:52:13
Hey thanks for the comment. And yeah someone mentioned that to me earlier. So it is certainly something I will address in the v1.1 update.
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:35:03
The tracks are static at the moment. But I will defo be adding more soon! Hoping to add some sort of live level in the future.
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:34:22
All your coins are mine
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:48:06
Stop it, you make me blush!
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:17:19
Boosts for daaaays
@_date: 2018-04-17 09:24:54
Link me?
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:33:08


Awww mate thanks a lot! It really does mean a lot :) Much appreciated &lt;3
@_date: 2018-04-23 09:18:38
Hey, the game has adverts in it. But they make a tiny amount daily, so the app relies on donations. But they make next to nothing. So no not really. But that’s fine as it was just a side project for me! And no I don’t mine Crypto with it. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:11:02
Who knows, maybe I have already planned that for v1.1? *shifty eyes*
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:25:31
Textures man, they all add up I'm afraid. It's 76MB on iOS for some weird reason.
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:25:26
Thanks! iOS or Android?
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:30:45
At the end of the tracks, you can save a screenshot of your track record to your local storage. It needs permissions to do so. Deny it if you’re not bothered about about screenshots :) 
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:46:54
Ah I see it! I wonder if it is copyrighted...
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:34:49
Hey, this happens on iOS but not on Android. I am not sure if you can decide when it is shown on Android. I'll certainly have a look into it. To be honest I may just get rid of the screenshot saving feature, as the majority of people probs dont save screenshots. And I dont want people getting worried when the permissions box appears.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:44:01
Confirmed future DLC :P
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:47:27
As said not live at the moment, but plans for it in the future. Will update will more tracks ASAP.
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:48:21
Hahah someone had to find it :)
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:14:09
Actually, if you look really closely, the Bitcoin rider actually has little black arms. Little easter egg for you.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:44:42
It doesn't, but it defo looks cooler.
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:49:19
Crypto Rider! A 2D racing game, where the tracks are historical price charts of popular Cryptocurrencies!
I was fed up of watching the charts during the bear market, so I thought I would make something a bit light hearted, to cheer myself and (hopefully) others up.
The game is easy to play, but hard to master. Also, no audio in the game as I imagined most people will be playing whilst travelling and listening to their own music.
** The game is free for iOS and Android devices. **
Download links:
[Crypto Rider Android](
[Crypto Rider iOS](
So yeah give it a download and let me know what you think!  Post some suggestions on what levels or riders you like to see in future updates.
Anyways thanks for looking!
**UPDATE 1** : Just wanted to say a big thanks to everyone for up-voting and commenting and downloading. It has been a crazy few hours. As much as I want to stay up all night and read comments I have to work tomorrow(UK TIME)! It's crazy to see the game I spent months on finally out there in peoples hands :)
And I actually had an article written about a game I made? New personal best achieved! 
Thanks again all!
Dan 
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:58:46
Exactly this. Make it free so people don't hesitate to download it. I was thinking of adding In App Purchases, but I know people can be put off by them. So I went against it, decided to go down the ads and tip jar root!
@_date: 2018-04-17 09:24:43
Already in the game!
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:18:19
Yeah, I thought the majority of people will play it while listening to their own music. Plus, I am a terrible audio programmer so I didn't feel like I could do it justice. Maybe in a future update?
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:50:17
yeah I actually got feedback on this earlier. It'll be added in v1.1!
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:45:38
Yeah how does it look on those devices? I dont have one to test on annoyingly. Whats the aspect ratio?
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:26:27
Yeah I hear you. A few other people have mentioned that. So I will defo add this in to the next release. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:32:37
This was part of my inspiration! 
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:36:09
It is already in the game! The last level on the list!
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:01:11
The reason it asks for this permission is because you can save screenshots at the end of each track when you get a new high score. Nothing shady promise :)
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:18:30


Hi, can you not press the button in the top right corner? The red x?
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:36:27
At the end of the tracks you have the option to share a screenshot of your time on Facebook and Twitter. It also gives you the option to save to your device. This is why it asks for permission for your media folder.
@_date: 2018-04-19 07:53:30
Yeah that track it proper lethal, lots of bumps. After the reception it has received I would be foolish not to! So yes, bug fixes, more tracks and more riders coming sometime in the next few weeks. Just need to find the time to do that all! 
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:09:40
Hi r/bitcoin
I just wanted to say a big thanks to everyone in the community who upvoted/commented/shared the post about the game Crypto Rider the other day. [Original Thread](
The last 36 hours have been intense and exciting. Especially as I made the game in my spare time and didn’t think anyone would play it. There has been a whooping 8000 downloads so far! I ended up getting interviewed for online articles and even got contacted by the BBC here in the UK to be interviewed for a video about the game. [BBC Video](
Hopefully the outcome will be that more people learn about Bitcoin and help with some sort of adoption.
Anyways thanks again! And be sure to send feedback of tracks/riders you’d like to see!

Noted down, thanks for the feedback. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:51:53
Hey thanks for the comment. It is available on both iOS and Android. Just search 'Crypto Rider' and it should come up. Or use the links in my other comment :)
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:35:55
No thats fine, I need to ad a check to see if it has tried to communicate with google play and stop calling it if it has. All to be added in v1.1 :)
