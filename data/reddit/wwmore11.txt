The volume makes no sense is my point. Tether fueled wash trading man. There’s not some Fomo run into crypto right now. Is what it is I guess. It’s not sustainable growth though. I mean I’m happy with the gains for sure, but anytime I see those flash pumps washing out futures bets I cringe. It actually scares away institutional and otc buyers. That’s the real bull run with substance we all want.
@_date: 2019-07-09 08:06:31
God these types of posts scare me...
This isn’t fomo dude. This is wash trading out futures bets by whale accounts, likely exchange owner groups. Highly manipulated. USDT printed pumps. Wake up. That’s not a “buy wall” it’s a fuckin bot.

@_date: 2019-07-11 00:19:38
There was already exposure that they’ve backed 27% of USDT with “other assets” not being usd. Who knows what’s really going on, but it’s been years of attempting to see their holdings without any audits or public vote of confidence from the company. One way or another, btc is the largest trade pair with USDT clearly across all exchanges that support USDT. If tether isn’t actually pegged to the usd with 2.8B in usd reserves, then it’s a dangerous game of inflated valuation to all volumes associated with it as a trading pair.

It’s no longer a get rich quick scheme, you’re quite a few years behind schedule for the lottery ticket. That said, you could go 2x to 10x on an investment in 10 years maybe.. or lose it all. It’s highly speculative as an asset class. You could read about what it’s all about, use it, spend it, gift it, replace it, and become a part of the crypto economy.. that’ll help you to “make money.”

Congrats, that all sounds commendable and like hard work. Fidelity may be testing the waters, but I think you’ll know once true institutional money floods the space beyond this speculation period. First of all the custody issues will be further resolved, liquidity will have grown immensely, and regulation will have the market much more balanced. There’s no reason to say bitcoin will remain relevant on the premise of hodl or sov alone. It’s why I brought it up. There’s not always some “they” sussing out “weak hands.” There’s such a thing as booking profits was my point, and I generally think those buying bitcoin should do so when the market pumps beyond rational belief. That’s all. Congrats on your success. I bought my first bitcoin in 2014 and have only loved learning about it more and more over time. Best of luck.

Seriously though... these price posts are so stupid. Tethers being printed on the damn hour, manufactured pumps to wash trade futures bets, and no real volume to speak of following any real news. I’m not hating the gains but they’re funky. Meanwhile burrito bro up in here acting like we’re entering real world adoption phase while most the speculators are still licking wounds and bitter in crypto. The future is bright, but this bull run smells like bull shit. My redditor for a day acct might be a fresh one, but I’m not a noob.

“The FUD, whales and manipulators are all scaring the weak hands with regulations and other stuff but I hodl to go 100x to the moon to buy a lambo. Remind me in a couple years.” Said every teenager who bought a fraction of a bitcoin and thinks they’ll be a millionaire in fiat someday. Lol

@_date: 2019-07-27 17:46:47
Why would I not? They were free. The community in bsv are insane on social media, but the protocol still clearly has value as a top 10 mcap coin. No one, including you or myself, knows how the market will play out over the YEARS. A top 10 basket of cryptos is a good hedge, even if I own much more btc than any other coin or fork. You’ve drank the koolaid man. Good luck with your gambling.
@_date: 2019-07-23 01:12:24
Bummer man. Sorry to hear that. Glad you have luxury homes to buy there at least. Moon boys are killing crypto though. Hodl and moon are so painfully amateur, it’s half the reason institutions don’t touch the asset. The liquidity is small compared to developed assets, and the ponzi mentality is volatile and ripe for corruption. Don’t expect mooning to sustain until crypto grows up.
@_date: 2019-07-28 00:15:28
Yep. It’s called wash trading.
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:48:12
What do you mean? 
The way the fraud COULD work is this:
Tether is printed but not actually supported dollar for dollar. Tethers then enter the market via trade on exchanges (bitfinex, etc), where they are used to buy btc and inflate the value. No actual dollars are exchanged to make the price go higher. The exchange is in cohorts with USDT, so they never actually buy the tethers. Then they use them to pump the price and clear out futures stacks. This could all be done very very easily in a deregulated and anonymous market.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:34:43
Was there any news to get us from 3500 to 13k in 6 months?
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:39:43
Depends on if more USDT is minted to keep the price up. If not, I’m guessing $8500.

@_date: 2019-07-17 04:22:32
How about the market rose from 3500 to 13000  in a couple months and is correcting and consolidating? If there’s any manipulation it’s exchanges wash trading futures stacks, probably in conjunction with USDT printing to inflate volumes. This isn’t “institutional” money man. They’ll be here when this garbage stops. Only people tripping right now are those that fomo’d into play during the last leg of this run up. Again. You one of them?

Agreed. I have a simple rule.. seem to good to be true? Take profit. Now that everyone is screaming hodl? Prob about time to buy this dip with that profit. I don’t do it daily or even weekly, I try to time the bigger trends. It’s managing a portfolio and asset, that’s far more mature, attainable and balanced than seeking moonshot lambos by hodl or flipping out every time there’s a wash trade that spins the market downward.

It’s an interesting thought, it’s definitely the goal, and it’s a lot further away than you think. Large merchants won’t risk the error reports still coming from lightning.

No I think that Tethers being printed without proof of backing has historically resulted in pumping btc. Sure it could be real dollar for dollar otc investment capital entering the space, but it certainly is fishy. Why not show then that the USDT is actually backed? Also, why then does USDT always seem to coincide with wash trading out moments of heavy stacked futures bets on particular exchanges? I’m highly skeptical of the manipulation and likely fraudulent activity in crypto trading.

The problem is that the more price hype marketing that spreads, the more likely people buy out of speculation to “get rich” in the ponzi lottery, then when they don’t, they dump. Then everytime it crashes it takes away credibility. Truth is that half the people who own bitcoin don’t even know what a wallet, address, or private key are.
