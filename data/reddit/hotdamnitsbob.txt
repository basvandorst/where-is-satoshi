just make sure you back up your wallet after you do obtain btc.  I lost 9.5 btc a year ago after failing to listen to that advice. Haven't made the jump to buy back in yet, but every day after using this sub I have been impressed by the support and community that has been created here. And makes me very comfortable when I do decide to buy again.

Well the fact that they keep delaying the shipping dates doesn't help.  Every day another Avalon hits the market the longer its going to take you to recoup that money invested.

The attitude in this community and other bitcoin communities around the internet is nothing but generous and helpful. We are all here to learn as much as we can and the people of this sub are some of the best teachers we could ask 
Although I own very very little btc , I still feel as though I belong and am part of something huge.  Our voice gets stronger every day and I know we're doing something great. One day we will be talking about bitcoin a with our grand kids, wether they are still around or not  and I believe they will be, we will have a great story of how we came together and fought to change this world we live in.

The first step is admitting you have a problem. Your doing pretty good so far. Thanks for spreading around the coins, it's all about introducing btc to everyone we can.
