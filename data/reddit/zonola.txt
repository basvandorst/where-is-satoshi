After the introduction, the BTC futures were trading at a higher price than the BTC market price.
This created an arbitrage opportunity: short-sell a future and hedge it with BTC from the market.
When the future contract expires, the BTC that is kept as a hedge needs to be sold in order to keep a neutral market position.

Yes, Segwit fixes high fees: a typical Segwit transaction is smaller than a legacy transaction because of the way transaction size is calculated.

Last block was mined 1 hour ago, this is getting ridiculous.

There is a nice arbitrage opportunity there: short OTCQX:GBTC and long BTC.

Where were you when fees were getting high?
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:30:35
There is a limit to the amount the tx fee can be manipulated, because anyone can buy a mining rig to profit from the increased fees.

It shows the big mistake that is BIP 9.

8mb will be the theoretical maximum, the actual size will be around 3.4 mb.

The soonest is August 23th, when SegWit activates. This makes the Lightning Network possible.

What is the point of signalling for Segwit, while not being ready?

Bitcoin needs to move forward. BIP 148 is the way to go.

BTC could take a hit when the arbitrage positions (short GBTC, long BTC) get closed.

Price will go up after the weekend, as usual.

Couldn't predict China banning ICO's.
However, BTC is doing better now.

Segwit 2X should be a fat Mona Lisa with two times the weight.

The price ratio BT1/BTC = O.7 and BT2/BTC = 0.3.
The ratio BT1/BT2 is therefor just above 2. Not 4 as you are assuming.

The sooner such flaws in Lightning Network can be found and repaired the better.

Not supporting UASF is ridiculous.

I wish Core was signalling for BIP148 by default.

Bitcoin is still there, it hasn’t gone away. Price is only a reflection of the popularity at a single moment. You will be surprised what 2019 brings.
