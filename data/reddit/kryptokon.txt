Not necessarily, because it could lead to centralization in the hands of the smaller players. And seeing as they have more mining power, there could be less incentive to mine if they aren't compensated possibly. Not sure if I'm correct, just speculating.

Yup exactly. I got hosed and owe them about 100$. Not bad considering the gains though. Still got enough saved. Going long. Definitely see what you owe and get on it. These guys aren't fucking around I bet they'll target is any chance they get.

Aw sorry to hear. Yeah I strongly advise people pay attention though. I traveled Europe this year, it's gonna bite me in the ass next year. Unless we're at 500k. Then it really doesn't matter LoL
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:23:22
I don't owe them shit. I just don't want jail time XD
