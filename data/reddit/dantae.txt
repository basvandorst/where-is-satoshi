I’ve already done the lose everything in the markets after 9-11. A little diversity in investments is a good thing. Bitcoin isn’t my retirement.  
Living in Illinois with college debt is not fun. Add that to property taxes, state income tax and health insurance. I rather one of them be gone and make living in the usd world a bit easier.

It’s a bit more than 5k. I got stuck in a situation where no one in town hired college students. GI bill covered tuition but room and board killed me.  Add that to a 5th year and college got expensive.  
I put $1500 into mining. Sold all that equipment when the $1000 bubble hit and recouped all that initial cash.  That Bcash fork was turned into btc and earmarked as free money to someday pay off debt. Honestly I am laughing my ass off seeing 11k when my friends thought I was crazy.

I am very tempted to do this myself. I am holding out just a bit longer. My hope is .25 btc will pay off my debt and another .25 let’s me startup a business idea I’ve had.  Debt free and build income with knowing in a year I will need 3 employees.

Lol I didn’t cap my upload and went from a 350 gig average to blasting past 1 terabyte in two weeks. Xfinity put a nasty pop up on my browser telling me I was given a grace month.

Well I know I’m on their list. I’ve contacted the FCC twice on them after lack of services and down time. They had to do some major repairs to my neighborhood because of me. But everyone around here is happy now that the service is fixed.

Normal usage is family of 4 using a lot of netflix/hulu and gaming, youtube and steam. 
But I decided to fire the raspberry pi up a few weeks ago and make it a full bitcoin node.  Simple enough, was fun relearning all the fun linux commands that i forget and relearn whenever I decided to do a project like this.  But I forgot one thing, to set a bandwidth limit for that device.  
After I got my Xfinity warning via popup I took a look at the device and it had 52 active connections to the node.  
Nice to have shattered my bandwidth record on bitcoin at least.

I am unemployed, my USD savings are still enough to last a bit more while I keep looking. Yet as my Dad told me "Your the richest broke person in the family".  My response is "Oh look I made another $3000 in the last 20 minutes."
I may not have a ton of bitcoin but enough to have a damned goofy grin on my face today.

I just set up a node with my raspberry pi, so I am going to claim credit for bitcoin hitting $5000. Its been nothing but up since I started running it 24/7.
But it totally wont be my fault when it drops in price, that is some other guys fault.

Senator Mike Kirk (R) IL
He wasn't my choice in the primaries but oh well.
