What a load of shit, really. I can't honestly tell people Bitcoin is 'teh future' if they need to do this. I wouldn't trust random fuck-tards at a meetup with my shoes, let alone my money/wallet/wife/children. How do I know they aren't colluding?

Do I need to post the XKCD comic? You know the one that has the crypto-nerds fantasy vs. reality of a $5 wrench? Are you really going to force me to do that...

It is what it is. 
Governments will fuck you so hard, bitcoin or not... **IF** they want to. Don't think for one second having bitcoin will protect you in meatspace. 
Poor people in 3rd world countries are not going to do the shit that is required to have and use bitcoin.
1. They don't have computers, generally.
2. Even if they have computers, they have no time to learn pgp signing, blockchain shit and so on...
2. They work all fucking day for pennies, so they can eat.
3. Every red-cent extra they have will go to help a family member.
So, what we are left with are rich people in 3rd world countries that now have an out to do shit that isn't as trackable. They can play with bitcoin all day. They have shit loads of options. This also applies to the **average redditor**, I suppose. 
Bitcoin doesn't benefit anyone but the people that already have money.
Corruption is a meatspace problem. It is a problem that bitcoin can't fix.

And why do I trust "that" guy?

Same as above... if you think "they" will not be able to get your private key if they **really** want it, you are in for a rough time.

Never said the intention of Bitcoin is to win hearts and minds, I said Elitism doesn't win hearts and minds. It is a fact. 
Trust me when I say, you don't want to see "animal survival instincts"... in the general populace. I work on the streets as a firefighter/emt in a very busy metro area. Your Bitcoin will not get you very far in the scenario where fiat money is unable to handle day to day purchasing. Your best bet in such a situation is water, ammo, food, training, and fitness. In that order.

Uhhh... Ross Ulbricht? Or do we not mention him around here?

is spot on. Don't blame a poor interface on the user. Also, elitism doesn't win hearts and minds.

Like almost all the developing world.... lots of poor people, where food and shelter are the primary concerns. Hell, they [shit on the beach in India]( because there are not enough bathrooms. 
**Per capita income of India is 2.6042 bitcoin per year!**
Yeah, its going to take off any minute now...
