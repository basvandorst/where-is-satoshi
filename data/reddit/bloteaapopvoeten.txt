Then why is DBIX / ArabianChain so left in the dust pricewise?
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:48:04
Yeah someone pointed it out to him, but he didn't care since he mined them and wanted to see if he could.
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:24:48
It was a total of like $40 back then I believe. Its on the forums

@_date: 2018-05-07 17:34:19
Yeah. Same old

I recommend losing a lot so everything else is not that bad. Like putting all your eggs in BTC-E bummed me out, but on the other hand a government sanctioned hodl wasn't that bad. Just hodl. It'll rise.

@_date: 2018-11-14 21:06:27
Ah so this is just an advertisement.
@_date: 2018-11-26 09:53:44
It is if you bought the dip
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:30:10
It seems you were holding the chart upside down.
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:58:13
Go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:43:39
Yeah this.

I bought some Bitcoin in September when it was at $4,800. It dropped to $3,800 a couple hours later. Don't worry about this.

I knew it.
@_date: 2019-05-05 17:30:56
But you just said so yourself, so that means you're not popular with the ladies.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:44:30
One step ahead of global warming.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:07:55
Does this mean the price will sky-rocket from now on?
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:30:53
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:19:22
Pshh I bought at 400 and sold at 600.. I'm really waiting for that drop and I'll hold on to them. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:07:58
So that's like what..? 20 cents?
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:06:39
Buy at $400,- sell at $600,-. Easy.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:40:54
I'm talking multiple thousands.
