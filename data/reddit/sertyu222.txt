yeah, I've lived in Kazakhstan for 3 years and after the huge inflation mid-2016, it's been mostly in the same range ever since then.

Nope, $5,000/$5100 (since it already got that). From the 2014 chart. 
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:35:10
Lol obvious scam then.
@_date: 2019-04-02 14:10:29
Nice round numbers also usually end up becoming supports and resistances just due to human nature. Still crazy how we got past $5,000 even for a few minutes.

Lol 2500 that’s chump change that’s about 25% of what I make from my daily trades (before taxes).

just sold my house. I think I can manage living in a cardboard box for a bit until it hits $20,000

More depends on how you use your indicators. And you don’t need a lot of them to do proper TA. Most of them are useless and are filler on the charts. 
I think people are just salty that most TA youtubers and whatever we’re saying bitcoin is gonna dip and it didn’t. They don’t understand that TA is only predictive based on previous price history and can’t 100% foresee exact price movements. That’s why people use stop losses.

No one that you know* 
@_date: 2019-04-04 13:38:56
It will go up or down.
@_date: 2019-04-04 13:39:36
It’s a bot account I think... look at the post history. 
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:00:42
Where did the link take you?
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:41:42
You’re saying you don’t know no one. Now your saying no one knows no one? Would you like to make a $1 billion bet on that? 
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:07:53
Yeah but it’s so mentally draining. Once I enter a trade that’s the only thing I want to check until I’m out lol. It’s kind of exciting at first but then you realize how much of your time it takes. Plus the amount of money I’m playing with would yield a couple dollars at most for a 1% gain. It’s a little less motivating knowing that these gains barely mean anything and I could make more working for an hour at any other job. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:50:44
And what if it dumps past $4200 tomorrow? Still not going to watch? Lmao nobody can predict the price with 100% accuracy. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:48:53
Did you use TA to figure this out? I don’t believe you. 
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:04:02
Have you tried contacting your bank? Sounds like that's where the issue is.
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:02:58
Lol I was just messing with you sounds like you’re getting quite emotional from this. Also can you point to which comment leads you to believe in me hodling any ripple? Lmao maybe actually read my comments before jumping to conclusions based on the subs I comment in :) 
And I didn’t say people will do this for 10+ years, but I bet you there’s a couple hundred people out there that have successfully traded and that was their main source of income at some point in their life. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:40:12
Off of what? TA? How much experience did you have in TA? 
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:54:01
If bill gates doesn’t accept a 2500 bet is he a scammer? �� 
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:18:32
That’s because I was just messing with him lol. Also, welcome to the internet! Enjoying your first day? :D

Why did you lose so much? Did they have stop losses back then?
I got into crypto trading last year and did the same mistakes, well except I just dove straight in. I’ve never put in more than I can afford to 100% lose though so I just treated it as a learning experience (and thus lost a lot lol) 
This year I’ve been doing alright except for when I went for vacation and decided fuck it I’m gonna go in on Xlumens and see how it goes... so just hodling and praying. Lost a good amount on that and now I’m back in other coins and nearly evened out my loss. I hope I can learn to trade better later on where I can make 1% gains everyday consistently.
