"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own." - these aren't Forbes journalists. I've seen some awful "contributions" on this part of their site...

Superb reply and often forgotten. People often look at the government like the Borg...forgetting it is made of people who are simply trying to get a job done and go home.

Any sources for that statement? Because fuck ups are common and all too human, and I doubt people are sent off to the gulag for it. There have been numerous recent examples of mistakes in the Chinese media and some of the people making them are still in the same jobs, yet alone "disappeared".

Seeing resistance at 55-60 but it is hard to predict. Is this people who are excited buying in at the new "low" price? Or more manipulation? 
Don't get caught up in the heady rush of the trade...if you've got a window open showing the price, you're too emotionally invested. There are well documented major issues at the moment so seat-of-the-pants speculation is going to see a lot of people get burnt. Instead, step back, and think - does bitcoin really have long term potential? And what price "should" it be at, remembering the prices it has traded at BEFORE the recent attention? 
Smarter people than I back the currency, but I haven't read much backing the recent bubble.
