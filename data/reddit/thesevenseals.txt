@_date: 2019-10-31 19:21:46
Wait what's the passiv and what's the active side of bitcoin?

Indeed that will help them getting back that Calcium so they can lay further healthy eggs. Thanks for all These great Tips. Finaly I can become a chicken farmer and dont have to invest in shady stuff anymore

hm think i will invest at the end of the week, if nothing serious happens. in the end, it will rise with the halving. only think that scares me are the whales and their ability to manipulate the market in such a strong matter. Thanks for your input!
@_date: 2019-10-31 09:17:36
alright thanks for you input. Really think i should just do it. if id thought like this from th beginning, id bought it while it was at 3600. Have a nice day mate
@_date: 2019-10-31 09:55:48

@_date: 2019-10-31 10:41:39
Yeah I already felt that when I didnt invest in january. Thanks for the heads up
@_date: 2019-10-31 09:57:09
well yeah but buy moving huge amounts of bitcoins around, the market automtically adepts, doesnt he? or am i getting something wrong?
@_date: 2019-10-31 21:00:15
Hm sounds interesting. Have to look into that. Could you share the Website you are using?
@_date: 2019-10-31 09:09:18
Yeah i guess its kinda like roulette. I believe the price will rice too. But i dont know if now is the right time to invest, seeing how I think its not really kosher how whales can manipulate the market
@_date: 2019-10-31 10:55:47
Na I want to hold
@_date: 2019-10-31 10:52:57
Hm why is holding bitcoin hard? Hard because it's hard to look at it if you loose some money or hard in hard to find the right moment? And yeah investing periodaclly seems smart.
@_date: 2019-10-31 09:54:18
daim i guess your right. till i get the information from some website, the information is long outdated. Great advice. thanks!
@_date: 2019-10-31 12:29:31

@_date: 2019-10-31 08:09:43

@_date: 2019-10-31 11:16:32
That's a great tip. I set up my Wallet ages ago but never actually tested it. Thanks
@_date: 2019-10-31 12:17:01
Smart smart. But what do I do with the shells? Eat them to for that Calcium?
@_date: 2019-10-31 10:43:44
Hm guess you are right. In the end, big buyers or sellers can impact the normal stock market just as much like whales can impact the bitcoin market. Thanks for sharing your perspectiv
@_date: 2019-10-31 12:30:39
Interesting Website. Thanks for sharing
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:02:08
It's a promo vid. It's all scripted. I believe its not even a real wallet
@_date: 2019-10-31 09:01:04
Could you elaborate?
