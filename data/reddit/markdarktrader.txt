I go for some European exchanges like Latoken, Bitstamps and a new one, just try recently Blockchain.io
The platform is more simple and user-friendly compared to others like Binance.
The cryptocurrency regulation in Europe is very strict so all these exchanges had been compliant with all these rules. I feel like they are quite safe and reliable.

I'm considering to move to the French exchange Paymium for fiat/BTC: very reasonnably priced, only 0.2% on all orders, and experienced (they are on the market since  2010). For altcoin trading, they launched recently Blockchain.io (trading fee as low as 0.1% on all orders) along with their own token, the BCIO, that offers discounts, just like Binance with BNB.
