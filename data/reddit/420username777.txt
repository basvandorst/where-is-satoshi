I doubt Goldman Sachs already in bitcoin. The capitalization of BTC would be way bigger as well as its price. 
....but, I do suspect they are planning something, and whatever they planning I think associated with Seg2x(NYA). Sex2x will not survive and won't replace legacy bitcoin, if there will be no BIG investors(same like happened with BCH). 
They(GS and all the Wall Street baks) could easily overtake bitcoin on seg2x by opening trades on their platform for their investors by supporting only seg2x and not legacy blockchain, and this may make current BTC holders to switch to a new bitcoin. Without strong investors like GS, seg2x is a dead project. But if money will flow in to a new bitcoin, price of it can become 1:1 (seg2x/legacy) and for regular users faster and cheaper transaction will be more attractive... but it will no longer be a bitcoin we all know, it will become controlled and centralized and managed again by these big bank.
Very scary stuff if this will happen.

Buy hard drive of 1TB just in case, save Core Bitcoin software there and encrypt the wallet with password. Give this password to the loved one and leave the hard drive in the bank. Until you die, no one can get access to your hard drive without you.

That's why its price went only once towards 1000, and bounced back to 400, because only "tens of millions" were spent. 
For BCH and Seg2X in order to get to bitcoins price, investors should put billions. 
Well, let's see is Goldman Sachs will be announcing bitcoin trading for their clients, and let's see which blockchain they will support then. But I have a bad feeling, that Wall Street's big money, might overtake bitcoin and force people to use s2x chain. Time will show...

That's not the goal, that's an excuse!

On the same blacklist for me.

Well said!

Unless some huge investor will come and start buying out cheap S2X coins, which will create hype and price increase, which can then force everyone to move out from Legacy block chain(including miners, because while S2X will be increasing in value Legacy BTC will decrease - we have seen it already with BCH. Miners will always be mining what is more profitable). But why BCH didnt replace legacy BTC? .... because there were no big investors like Goldman Sachs clients.

True. Like in any other exchange platform, you have no obligation to provide any verification docs, until you want to withdraw fiat(Wire/Visa/MC...maybe some others, I have never withdrew my fiat from there, I was simply trading there.)
Your savings are safe. But you probably will face limits for withdrawals, when they come back on-line.
BTW, below is text from statement from DOJ:
"...The indictment describes Alexander Vinnik, 37, a Russian citizen, as the owner and operator of multiple BTC-e accounts, including administrator accounts, and also a **primary beneficial owner** of BTC-e’s managing shell company, **Canton Business Corporation**..."
There is no Canton Business Corporation registered in Cyprus, and never was. Where they are getting all that from?

Completely agree with you. I think they were expecting to find some dirt on his devices that would link him to btce, or expected he will start talking about others. Counts 3 to 19 will be dropped. It will be very hard to prove, Vinnik did these transfers.

Evidence which they are struggling to get. And which they do not have.

Very bad investigation. Emails are not going through gmail. Where you getting this info? I guess from email headers, of one of the emails you received from them to your gmail account:) 
"Educated guess" haha.
*addition*: emails were sent from UK servers. Here is headers info from one of the emails I received from them.
**Received: from mail.jangopong.org (mail.JANGOPONG.ORG. [184.172.231.194])**
Are you working on CNN? Fake news? Or you just say whatever makes you feel good?
You can not freeze domain or cloudflare account. And If domain will be seized, there will be a notice of it. Or in case of abuse reports, you will also see the notice about domain being locked. Non of this happening.
Currently Btc-e.com is still on cloudflare and page of twitter is still hosted somewhere. Meaning, admin has control of cloudflare account, coz i doubt admin hosted this Twitter page on the same server, which was recently seized(then he doesnt need to access cloudflare account to edit new changes for new server). What i think is, Admin got new server, logged in to cloudflare account, chaged servers IP, maybe edited dns, and thats it. Thats why everybody sees twitter page and not error page.
Cloudflare was simply ddos protection proxy. Btce Server was hosted by Softlayer(more likely, not 100% sure), which points to 2 ip addresses: US(Chicago) and South Korea. More likely what they will be able to find on server's HDD is simply scripts that run the website, no identifiable info, using remote database hosted again else where, for sure not in USA. No need to panic.

DOJ and other 16 agencies also said Russia hacked the 2016 election. But still no proof has been provided.

Exactly, indictment was filed on January 18th, 2017. Until now, if they would have hard evidence, they would have seized the domain together with servers. They are hoping for Vinnik to start giving them info they dont know, or they expected to find something on servers or devices that they confiscated. And Vinnik could have been simple support employee, for example "API admin" who has nothing to do with any transactions there. His involvement should still be proven with evidences.
