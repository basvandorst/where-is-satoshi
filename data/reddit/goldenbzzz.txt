The most stupid group of stupid people. They want  twitter and theyre using rbtc. Why cant they just use  and rbch for reddit. In their sub, they attack bitcoin everday. They dont deserve the rbtc sub. They dont have anything but keep attacking bitcoin and push the transaction fees issue. Now the lightning is launched, i dont know theyre still posting that transaction highway btc/bch comparison and still get the most upvotes. Seriously, are these people even humans, they have so much hate on btc
