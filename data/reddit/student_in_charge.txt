Lets investigate this transactions:
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:48:48
GUYS, i think i've found a way. Look, original clues should be treated like markers - there were 6 clues:
* Think in pairs
* Code easily, attack early
* Lost transaction costs almost users
* 00212121
* Try +1
* Almost open
Each clue is drawen somehow in the puzzle. For example "Try +1" is clearly seen at the picture between words "block" and "chain". "Code easily, atack early" - also at those picture region (i have not found the word easily).
So, i suppose this clues should be found on the picture and geometrically "clues" (like "Try +1" possibly point to words or word "block" and "chain") points to some words.
There are 6 clues - each may point to one or two words. We should find the clues on the picture, understood which words they point and try these words in order of clues. 
Thats all, in my langugae there is such proverb: "When the finger points to the sky - only a fool looks at the finger"
Please, dont forget about me :)))

Here what i've found:
1) Install node.js from here 
2) use console (for windows - cmd, for unix it would be terminal emulator (ctr+alt+T etc.)) and navigate to directory where you will manage the problem (where you will create a script and will work with it). Here run in the console the command "npm install bitcoinjs-lib" ( and then "npm i bip39" ( it will download and install required for the script packages.
3) Create in this directory file with the next content (it would be the working script, assume you will name it as 'script.txt'):
(here the link to pastebin: 
var bip39 = require('bip39');
var bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib')
var lineReader = require('readline').createInterface({
  input: require('fs').createReadStream('addresses.txt')
var ctr = 1;
lineReader.on('line', function (line) {
    if (ctr%100 == 0) {
        console.log("Processing  + ctr);
    }
    if (bip39.validateMnemonic(line)) {
        var roothex = bip39.mnemonicToSeedHex(line);
        var rootnode = bitcoin.HDNode.fromSeedHex(roothex);
        var basechild = rootnode.deriveHardened(49)
                .deriveHardened(0)
                .deriveHardened(0)
                .derive(0);
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
            var child = basechild.derive(i);
            var keyhash = bitcoin.crypto.hash160(child.getPublicKeyBuffer())
            var scriptSig = bitcoin.script.witnessPubKeyHash.output.encode(keyhash)
            var addressBytes = bitcoin.crypto.hash160(scriptSig)
            var outputScript = bitcoin.script.scriptHash.output.encode(addressBytes)
            var address = bitcoin.address.fromOutputScript(outputScript)
            if (address == "3CcxyPhyvyc3S9UuPfu42GNZLvVVV11Uk8") {
                console.log("Found seed! " + line)
            }
        }
    }
    ctr++;
(without +++++++)
4) Create in the same directory file named 'addresses.txt' where each line is the 12 BIP39 words that should be bruteforced.
5) Run in the console this script by: "node.exe script.txt" (for windows) or "node script.txt" (for unix, maybe in unix it would be different)
That's all i've found. If you will find the file with all BIP39 words, share it please ))) (on pastebin for example)

Sorry, but to bruteforce this btc problem you'll need at least basic coding skills. 
If be honest, given instructions are easy and could be done even by non-coder i suppose but, for sure, the problem solving will require improvements (at least formulating of the 'addresses.txt' with all BIP39 words permutations) that seems to be hard for non-coder.

The main problem is that message could be stored in various ways - not just simple LSB. But, yes, it should be tried - for example take the last significant bits of first 256 bytes of the image (not file but image ) - use it like private key.

:Not sleep yet, but going to: Ukraine, Radiophysicist.
@_date: 2018-05-19 21:17:53
Could you prove it? 
For example - make a transaction from the "3CcxyPhyvyc3S9UuPfu42GNZLvVVV11Uk8"

Good luck to everyone, i am going to sleep.
(if someone are going to bruteforce it - here is the hint to start with: 
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:36:54
One of the clue: "Lost transaction, costs almost users" - possibly it's about "change". When you spend some BTC (transfer it from one "key" to another) the "remainder" of the transaction is sent to the third "key" like  here: 3EqeHArTgtENAAPfj5M6z75X5SKVgg2wJu, where "ramainder" is equal  numerically to another clue: "00212121". Well, guys, now i am thinking about clues in other sight....
@_date: 2018-05-20 00:00:37
Look my post 
You may try to bruteforce BIP39 12 words combinations. I can't figure out which words to use, maybe some of your variants or some of theese:
attacker 
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:30:54
blockchain.info / electrum or script that i've posted here.
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:41:03
And this
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:39:02
No, just by space. But, please see the next my comment. I think we both moving in wrong direction.
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:32:52
Well, infinity symbol that under the lamda (suppose it is 8 byt rotated) could help you, guys.
@_date: 2018-05-20 00:04:21
By the way, guys, may be CLUE  is the seed ??
"sorry inbox is flooded when you have the answer there will be no doubt It's not easy but it's absolutely possible think in pairs"

@_date: 2018-05-20 11:20:49
Weel, may be it would be reasonable to use some like this: 
Given script will brute all BIP39 mnemonics stored in 'addresses.txt', check it for for adequacy and then check if it correspond to the given BTC address (that contains 1 BTC - 3CcxyPhyvyc3S9UuPfu42GNZLvVVV11Uk8)
I suppose it should work faster then "speaking" with blockchain.info or even local blockchanin database. Think about it. (P.S. I have not successed yet, cause still not sure about words to be used - you know even 12 words leads to ~10-40 Gb 'addresses.txt' with 479001600 permutations that will require ~ week of time to brute it, add one more word and you will increase this complexity by order....)
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:18:04
Same here( ), going to sleep. Hope OP has not trolled us.
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:36:21
Please prove it - make a transaction from mentioned here BTC address (3CcxyPhyvyc3S9UuPfu42GNZLvVVV11Uk8).
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:22:07
Oh, crap ... seems intrigating.

Guys, here what if i've found (i believe that i am not the one who found it cause it is simple). This picture contains z=** expressions like z=0, z=1 ... . It is possible this expression state the order in which words or symbols from words that lies somewhere near the expression should be used as part of private key or words seed. 
You may try the comdinations on the next site:  (to generate pair of public/private keys) + use blockchain.info (to revise public key status etc.)
If this information would be usefull, please send me some tip xxxx)))), thank you very much !
P.S. BTC for tip: 1D1KVRA7GeWd9ZqW3mgv8ovU7iy6Sj2LuD
P.S.S. here the link to image where expressions are cirlced:

Those code already tuned to the given problem. It consumes file 'addresses.txt' that should contain all BIP39 seeds - each line is 12 BIP39 words. So the main problem is to prepare this 'addresses.txt' (for example all possible permutations of some given here (i mean in Reddit) words). Then just run the script. But, if you will try to compose 'addresses.txt' with full set of, for example, 12 words permutations it would contain 12! lines ~ 30 Gb of memory (depends on words length). So it is a bit tricky. More over it will take a lots of time to brute force all these permutations (in order of ten's of days - decades i mean, sorry for my english, i am not native speaker)
