There may be a finite supply of Bitcoin, but there's an infinite supply of cryptocurrencies.

I dunno. Commodities means its not a currency

@ 10k a week, he’ll have about 500k invested in a year. That represents less than a 10,000th of his total wealth. This investment is comparable to you buying a stick of gum.
@_date: 2019-03-05 18:03:34
Bitcoins MC is in the tens of billions, so 10k, or $500k a year, is still nothing.

Is accepting one cryptocurrency vs accepting multiple really that much of a difference from the vendor's perspective?

I think a better example would be owning a car, but not investing in auto companies.

Serious question: What's to stop the US government from creating its own cryptocurrency?

Being critical of Bitcoin as an investment doesnt mean blockchain tech is without merit. The dotcom bubble is a great example.

In the late 90's, investors in the internet bubble were correct that the internet was the future. Unfortunately for them, they were incorrect in which individual companies would be part of that future. This is a rather typical occurrence with new technologies. Look at automobiles. Over a hundred years ago, you'd have been right to assume that automobiles were the future of transport in America. The only problem would have been guessing which automobile companies, and there were a hundred, were part of that future. 
I think it's entirely believable that cryptocurrencies are the future, I just see little to no reason to suspect that I can predict which ones will be part of that future. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:34:19
Yea, a currency. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:41:30
But dont you see the contradiction of calling it a currency but then the rallying cry to be not to spend it? 
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:35:17
How can it be mass adopted if the rallying cry is not to use it as a method of payment. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:41:44
This subreddit: Bitcoin is a currency
Also this subreddit: Hodl!
Pick one. Either it’s a speculative asset that will appreciate if there are more buyers than sellers or it is a currency that will appreciate if it’s used to buy more goods and services. 
In other words, you guys claim it’s money while treating it like a speculative asset.
@_date: 2018-07-07 12:27:03
Just wanted to point out, for bitcoin to replace fiat currency, it would have to be sanctioned by every federal government in the world. Every single one would have to willingly give up their right to print money. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:25:08
@_date: 2018-07-13 03:32:13


Which is why Bitcoin’s rallying cry is literally not to spend it.

Yes the Manhattan Project was real, and in that same vein, the faking of the Moon Landing was real*.
I fail to see how they arent similar. Both would involve tricking thousands and thousands of people into believing theyre doing one thing and then actually theyre doing something else.
But I will admit, it would have been easier to do the Manhattan Project for two reasons:
1. You could give different people different stories, where as with the Moon Landing Hoax, your story has to stay consistent. Much more difficult.
2. The secrecy of the Manhattan Project only had to last say 6 years. The Mooning Landing Hoax would have to have lasted 6 decades. Much more difficult.
 But really the thousands of people bit is a but disingenuous because it includes everyone that built the equipment and drove the trucks, etc. I dont know what the official Moon Landing Hoax conspiracy entails, but Im guessing your average plumber wouldnt know the difference between if we sent a rocket up into space or if we sent a rocket to the moon. At a certain point, namely once the rockets up in space, were taking what happened afterwards on faith. And I categorically have zero faith in the government's ability to tell the truth. Especially during the height of the Vietnam War for pete's sake. 
As for the civil war, that sounds ridiculous, but Ill take a look before passing judgment.

Youre misinterpreting his logic to arrive at some random conclusion so you can build a straw man. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:41:37
He's saying that unrealized losses are real losses and youre bringing up opportunity costs, seemingly at random. Care to explain how to two equate?
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:45:44
Sure anything can be a lie, but it doesnt mean we accept everything as truth. A full scale war had millions of participants and witnesses. To my knowledge, there's never been any precedent for a war being faked. And Im not sure what the motivation would be either.
Going to the moon would only require a handful of belligerents, all of them are carefully vetted government employees, and the motivation is quite clear.
Not saying we didnt land on the moon, but it wouldnt surprise me. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:17:32
Well Ill admit mistakes of omission are a very real thing. If you knew enough about Apple to invest in it, but didnt, then thats a mistake. But you cant just point to every thing that's gone up and say it was a mistake not to invest. Decisions have to be judged based on your knowledge at the time, not hindsight. 
With that said, unrealized losses are also a very real thing. Now if the stock were down for some spurious reason, then I wouldnt be bothered at all. In fact, Id be delighted. But since I believe this post was in a bitcoin subreddit(?), I wouldnt have that kind of optimism. The bitcoin's price has been driven up disproportionate to any utility it may serve. It's clearly a speculative bubble. Im happy sitting on the sidelines, because history tells us how these things play out.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:00:39
Sure, and 130,000 people worked on the Manhattan Project, but the work was compartmentalized and not everyone was aware that they were actually working on a nuke.

The fact you no longer walk into banks helps their bottom line.
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:48:39
Thats kind of the point tho. The circles around LTC and Monero make them easier to identify from across the table.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:38:01
The fact purchases with bitcoin are still seen as a novelty worthy of an up vote parade is telling.
