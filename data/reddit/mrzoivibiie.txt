The genie doesn't go  back in the bottle. You can't put the cat back in the bag.

Just because their account is new doesn't mean shit. My account is still new, doesn't mean I'm new to crypto or inexperienced.

I ordered the astronaut reaching for the btc. Perhaps the OP can get a lil gift if this post causes results in a lot of sales! ;)

I just purchased because of this post! Congrats man, this artwork is sick and your about to get alot of attention. So glad I got mine before it sells out. If you can, please sign my copy on the bottom. Asencion A is my name. And I'd also like to suggest a zombie themed crypto poster perhaps?

No need. This is crypto. Facts are useless. Only Twitter and reddit matter
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:42:27
You don't need to explain yourself man. I'm about to hop on patron myself because of you pointing it out. All I want is out of the industry I'm in currently and find a way to make a living in the cryptoworld..

Why do so many people like trezor over ledger nano? Ledger nano supports more coins, seemed like a no Brainerd to me. But also feel like I could just build one of these myself, so I have yet to buy either.

Why would you need a backup unit?

This was my plan....

I also recently took the plunge after not reading too much about altcoins since 09. Unfortunately when I bought is when the china rumors started so I lost a little bit.. but I imidiatly took that opportunity to buy more altcoins! I'm definitely in it for the Long haul as well. So much so that I even started a Twitter channel to consolidate all the altcoin news. It's just for personal use but if anyone else would like to check it out it's  on Twitter.

I think... One of 2 things.. backlash. And or the elite syphon their wealth into crypto/start their own.

That's like comparing the internet to books. Who cares if we have a series of connected computers when we already have libraries.
