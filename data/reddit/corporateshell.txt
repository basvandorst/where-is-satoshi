Yeah the mempool is pretty much empty. You could probably have a 5 sat/b fee and get confirmed in less than an hour
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:52:16
Yeah it's super easy. I guess Linux might use the command line but that's just because for 99% of people using those OSs that's the preferred method of installing software
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:18:03
On a scale of 1 to literally shaking how are you feeling right now?
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:24:42
I like to spend Bitcoin whenever I can but buy back right after. Best of both worlds
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:52:47
How is this relevant to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:59:59
They don't charge mining or ACH fees. There are trading fees though
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:01:20
If you have the right type of screen
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:08:51
Yeah he can't seriously be expecting 1000+% returns year over year. Like come on
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:15:35
Uh duh. How is this relevant?
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:18:53
Yeah hopefully Monero is able to add multisig so you can use Lightning. That would be a really interesting use case 
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:44:47
Would the NSA really want to tip their hand that they broke ECDSA for a few bitcoin? They get gov funding and it's not like they could supplement it with stolen bitcoin. If they broke ECDSA they sure as hell wouldn't want to reveal it until they had something huge
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:42:01
I think that people have been proposing every $500 which seems pretty reasonable to me. It just simply isn't that big of an event when BTC rises $100 anymore
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:51:26
Yeah I was pretty impressed by this segment. It was a pretty solid overview for the layperson without misrepresenting anything major
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:25:18
I'm in that exact same spot bud. Feels bad
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:47:48
Eh I feel like labelling it "Bitcoin Address" might make it slightly less incognito
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:23:10
It was probably already unlocked
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:14:33
Yeah, I get it but I still don't understand how that is relevant to the comment you responded to saying that governments would sell the bitcoin they mine.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:56:36
Great summary you psychotic canadian
@_date: 2017-08-21 05:04:55
It depends on the company and their stance on Bitcoin. Most companies that accept Bitcoin do it through Bitpay which allows them to convert a set amount (or all) directly into Fiat
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:40:40
Eh not really most don't. Only OLED screens have lower part usage on dark colors. iPhones don't have OLED screen and one of the only Android manufacturers with them is Samsung
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:29:30
Depends on how many people are using segwit. I think if everyone does block will be somewhere around 1.7 mb
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:46:50
Yeah, I don't even know how to react. Happy because I made a bunch of money. Sad because there wasn't a dip for me to double down on Bitcoin during like I hoped
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:00:58
They don't charge mining or ACH fees. There are trading fees though
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:39:00
Segwit2x will be a hard fork and it is beginning to look more and more contentious as it approaches. I think a lot of small blockers might stay behind on the legacy chain. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:37:33
Just because it worked out doesn't mean it was a wise plan. It's reckless and dangerous regardless of if he makes money or not
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:26:53
The same way stock or forex traders do. It's not that difficult of a concept to gasp
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:13:34
Why not? I'll give it at go, I want it
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:30:40
I feel the same way. Add to that the fact that I want to avoid another contentious hard fork
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:49:52
Same. I dumped early
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:54:01
Yeah mine was in the middle of the first rush to $3000 and it still only took a couple of days
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:01:23
They don't charge mining or ACH fees. There are trading fees though
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:20:42
The rest of us are happy we can buy more
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:34:56
Thanks for the advice. How were you able to predict this? Tea leaves? Crystal ball?
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:11:32
Eh I think it's a decent trade off
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:38:45
Yeah there have been rumblings about this in the recent days and quite frankly it seems more and more likely. Hopefully it stays solvent through this rush of withdrawals
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:13:33
I mean it makes sense. If you already have to meet up in person it makes a lot more sense to just use cash so you're not waiting around for confirmations.
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:38:47
I mean technically it would be a classic example of cash flow insolvency
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:55:49
The catch is that you have to tie up funds in the lightning network (sort of like using a prepaid card)
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:45:24
I don't think that's your problem. Gemini recently experienced a problem with their ACH processor and had to temporarily suspended instant credits. You just got unlucky and transferred during that window
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:56:28
Have you noticed that the prices don't seem to be 100% current for you also?
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:46:57
If you're worried about tx fees use a different exchange. For instance gemini offers free BTC withdrawals
