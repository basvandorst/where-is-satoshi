Mery Christmas! I love the idea of what you are doing!

Thanks :D

Yes, I thought it was kind of obvious, but thats what he was commenting on, not the cleanliness, but the "clean" design.
 
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:24:13
Will do.
@_date: 2015-12-31 00:28:21
Sadly I talked to him on the phone today(stopped by couple days ago and left my number) He said he is locked out of the account and can't get in. He didn't specify what the account was, but I could only push so far. I will upload the call when I get home tonight, not very exciting unfortunately.
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:26:37
Here is the call I made yesterday after he called me and I didn't answer.
@_date: 2015-12-25 07:06:26
What's better?
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:20:47
I don't really care if you believe me, I don't have any proof(cell pic of his face?). His name tape said XXXX, and it was at Taco Casa in Manhattan, KS.

I don't know what kind of boring cards you have, but I constantly get comments on my Google wallet card, and this is the 2nd time someone has asked about my shift card. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 01:05:53
I will have my phone recording when I go back in a couple days, and ask for him. Whatever happens, I will post it.

I plan on it, not so much for reddit, but for my own curiosity. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:24:03
Thanks so much, I will be following up with video proof, will be eating there and asking for him, if he is still working there....
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:22:23
This is probably the case, I didn't know how people used/stored coins back then.
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:23:27
No, I just explained it all to him, and he is in for the long haul, and is ok with loosing everything if it falls out.
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:39:47
He asked me to buy bitcoin for him, and I asked when to buy it, not if I should buy it.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:43:44
It's pretty easy with coinbase...,
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:29:52
If you had $1000 to invest in crypto right now, how would you spend it?
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:55:11
I miss read, I thought he was saying it's hard to get BTC in the US.
@_date: 2014-07-11 00:18:40
Thank you for your non-advice. It is truly non-helpful.
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:23:53
How many did you save.
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:28:02
Good on him.

@_date: 2016-01-05 06:55:16
Just get a SHIFT card through coinbase.
@_date: 2016-01-09 05:43:02
See above

Coinbase keeps an exportable record of all transactions made on their platform, for tax purposes. Every time you make a transaction with the Shift card, BTC are pulled from your Coinbase account, and sent to an entity called "Shift Payments". These transactions are recorded in the tax file with the BTC amount and price in USD that you sent. If you buy your coins through them, and "sell" through Shift, all the relevant tax information will be in the file, you just need to decide whether your taxes will be taken LIFO or FIFO (whether you're taking capital gains / losses relative to the oldest coins you bought, or the most recent ones).

Good point. All you BCOIN investors GTFO of our subreddit.
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:25:46
Good point, financial markets and the current financial situation in China have no effect or relation to bitcoin. Delete post.

So we should just cross our fingers and hope your company doesn't go bankrupt or just have any number of attacks that would result in loosing the gold(e.g Mt Gox).

I shall shed a single tear for your loss and the hardship you endure having only 118k USD worth of magic internet money.

Well, when you feel bad, just remember that her 20% investment is more money that 95% of the free world will ever dream of having in their saving/investments. Best case scenario, she makes millions off it, worst case, she is still filthy rich.

It was the PayPal app.

Holy shit, this remake is so much better than the others, I actually got chills watching this one, great job man!

It's the best shield in the game, it's rare, but totally worth saving for important portals.
