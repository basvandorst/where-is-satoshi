okay obviously it’s not but, for me it’s a goal i’d love to see be hit while i’m buying coin. Obviously the real long haul is pluto at 1 million

My moon is 50k, i just started and it’s only small amounts but, i’m looking to keep buying and buying! I’m in it for the long haul kids.

Damn. I wish i was on top of it like you are. Hopefully one day i can say i own a couple of coins

God damnit am I jealous of you... i remember seeing bitcoin cards for like $10 a pop when i was like 14.... that was 6 years ago, i wish i understood then what i do now... I could have bought those with my allowance and have millions now... it’s a hard knock life...

How many did you start with and how many have you kept? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:00:57
i’m just waiting for it to fall again so i can get into this game and stop waiting for that “One day”... i’m so upset i didn’t start four years ago... 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:11:47
Yeah, just gotta pony up and buy some. It’s obviously worth the risk. Just sit on it until it hits a peak in 2 years and you’ll probably be a very happy person. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:21:12
I should set something up like that... 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:23:20
yeah that’s how i feel about it now. So hopefully i can get a decent amount in it and just let that baby cook for a couple of years.
