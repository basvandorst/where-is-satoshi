When you copied the password file to your USB key was it stored on your PC first?  If so, a file calving utility may be able to recover the data from empty sectors on your PC.  Something like Foremost might help if you know any of the other text that might be in your password file.

It works in seconds if you have an account with Barclays. Unfortunately Blockchain charge about 5.5% to fund your account using this method which is way too much.  If bitcoin is to go mainstream it needs to have conversion rates less than the couple of percent that banks charge IMHO.

I'm not Muslim but there might be some synergies to be had.
On the subject of buying in the UK, I just got some from bitbargain and that seemed to go well.  They're a market like localbitcoins.

Maybe the UK banks will allow them to trade now?

I wonder if some of the smaller, maybe even Islamic banks would allow this or whether it's an instruction coming from somewhere in central government?
