no, its actually just called volatility. volatility makes you feel like a genius until it crushes you.

rofl says the guy who's "money" is losing a noticeable amount of buying power with each post. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:43:17
yeah looking through your history you don't send a lot of money to anybody you broke ass loser. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:33:29
uh I've been doing that for a long time with wells fargo. try again?
EDIT: I should mention, zero fees and near instant transactions. 
fuck dude, even paypal was doing this way before bitcoin. what is your point here? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:51:37
lol not heavy enough. do you really think more bitcoins traded in the last couple of days than all of last year? get your head right dude. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:46:10
ok...that doesn't really make any sense but whatever. enjoy watching the ticker I guess :)
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:17:23
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:42:24
PM me your well fargo account number or paypal info.
oh wait, you don't have either?
well guess what, i don't have a bitcoin wallet. 
guess we are in the same predicament huh? so tell me again, what is so special about bitcoin? its just another service, but while mine is accepted almost everywhere yours is useless. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:12:28
holy shit you really are retarded I thought you were just trolling
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:09:43
hey man hows bitcoin doing? still up 53%??? not watching the ticker currently. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:43:00
yes because all other technology except bitcoin will flatline gg retard gg. 
never going to happen btw. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:23:14
wow 53% that's almost enough to be significant given where bitcoin traded all last year
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:56:12
hmm, no more than last year and the year before and the year before.
enjoy your coins I guess. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:16:27
dude, you need to learn ASAP that "news" is irrevelant. the news always, always, ALWAYS comes after the trade. the news is almost always made up to support the current price action, not the other way around. 
man you bitcoin traders are fucking stupid. news stories are just made up stories to trick dipshit "investors" into buying stocks and create interest (which can sometimes translate into liquidity). And man, bitcoiners are one group of people who CLEARLY don't understand the importance of liquidity (rofl bitcoin is useful and has value because of its scarcity! ROFL!)
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:33:46
also keep your twenty fucking cents you cheap fuck
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:54:38
do you really believe that?
rofl. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:33:15
why not post the full chart OP?
you do realize that if something is truly a "bubble" then it will never recover from the so called "blow off phase", right?
no, of course you don't. this is your first time doing this.
you guys are so cute. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:44:55
wow I'm so impressed that you watched your buying power increase exponentially and you sat on your hands instead of selling. seriously good for you. instead of making a hefty profit and never having to worry about money for the rest of your life you instead spend all your free time passing around fractions of a dollar and telling people how great bitcoin is, all the time praying it "goes to the moon" again. 
nice dude. nice.

how is having to sign up for a changtip account, creating a bitcoin wallet, and finding a way to sell my bitcoins removing friction? its no different than signing up for a paypal account. In fact it is way more complicated, time consuming, and RISKY. As someone who gets donations via twitch and paypal pretty frequently I can safely say with years of experience "bitcoin does not solve anything". You think way too much of simple things. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:24:06
you know who gets the same kind of thrill from watching their bankroll swing up and down wildly?
its ok my friend. there are others like you, and there is help available. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:22:11
yeah but see the main difference between BTC and USD is I don't have to spend my USD on USD to keep USD afloat while BTC constantly requires me to spend USD to keep it afloat. 
I mean honestly. You guys are spending money to buy more money. How fucking stupid, white, and privileged can you possibly be?
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:18:25
you can use bitcoin to buy drugs from the deep web and speculate on its future price. outside of that it is completely useless. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:26:08
uh huh well at least my IRL wallet didn't light itself on fire and burn over half of its contents last year. 
yep, I must be clueless. what can I do with bitcoin again that I can't do with, idk, a fucking debit card which has always been free for me to use and own? oh, right, nothing, except buy drugs on the deep web and speculate on the future price of bitcoin ofc.
