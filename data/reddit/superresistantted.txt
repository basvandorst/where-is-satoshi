So it's instant between Fidor UK and Fidor Germany, correct ?

This cryptocurrency is one of the most interesting and innovating. Don't miss it.
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:12:42
Even the great Google doesn't know ?

What is funny is that it was not only ineffective but it actually promoted buying drugs online. 
The traffic doubled in some area lol.

Contrary to amateur exchanges you are used to, Revolut have banking standards. It doesn't disappear just like that and cryptocurrency is not their core business (point of failure). Not to mention they aren't exposed to 99.9% of hacks because they don't have a hot wallet for deposit/withdrawal. As opposed to losing your BTC on your computer and have no appeal ever, you can sue Revolut and probably get back your money (again this is not an amateur crypto exchange like MtGox).
As a user of Revolut, I found their app and services to be one of the most secure I ever seen among banks. Pretty impressive.
PS : Please don't tell me the story of cyprus bank bailin, I know it and it's not related.

My point was that the IPO is either a bad joke or a scam.
You don't raise that amount of money in few hours for a dodgy project.
Most people sent BTC being manipulated by the quick rush of money.
@_date: 2014-04-24 13:41:06
I can't believe people were stupid enough to believe MaidSafe Bitcoins IPO were from real investors.
@_date: 2014-04-14 14:32:04
Yes... more blood, more Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:10:19
It's fucking easy to make money. It is way better than a casino. Here, if you invest now, you are 100% sure of wining. Of course there will be an end but that's part of the game.

A Ripple scam 2.0 ?
NO THANKS !
@_date: 2014-05-18 08:23:32
Me for example. I have some CHA. 480BTC has been burned in total. You can buy CHA on poloniex : 
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:56:25
The distribution was proof-of-burn. People burned a massive amount of Bitcoins to get XCP. It was certainly the fairest distribution ever. Now you can only get them through exchanges from the people that burned their BTC.

It's simple. You buy them cheap now and wait for Asians gambler to lose. You come back later and sell for a big profit or just hodl to death.
@_date: 2014-03-31 07:01:44
I really don't get all these people that buy high and sell low. It is retarded but that's what most people do. What's wrong in their head ?
@_date: 2014-07-03 14:42:57
Thanks to [XMR] Monero.
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:15:14
I am actually very knowledgeable about Bitcoin and I am against the Proof-of-Work system. Not to forget the hyper centralisation of pools, ASIC hardware manufacturers and buyers (miners) . I think it is not sustainable. Proof-of-Stake is the way to go until we find a better system.

Lol that "story" again.
No one with a brain would take a huge loan to buy Bitcoins.
No one with a brain would buy high and sell low.
I don't see how is it possible to lose in Bitcoin if you consider waiting at least a year. Don't tell me it is going down on short term. Here is a fact : Bitcoin never been going down if you take a 1 year or more period.
Have you ever watched a Bitcoin chart on a large scale ?
Do you need help to use the buttons ?
@_date: 2014-03-31 07:17:17
No because I am not interested in FIAT but cryptocurrency.

It is not my title, it is the name of the thread I was linking.
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:08:15


It is :
./autogen.sh 
CONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32/share/config.site ./configure --prefix=/
EDIT : You are right, I fixed the instructions. Have a look.

@_date: 2017-03-29 11:35:02
(updated for UASF-Segwit:0.3)
I followed the instructions and it worked. 
First you must activate Windows Subsystem For Linux, google it. Then open a bash and follow :
* sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config bsdmainutils curl unzip -y
* sudo apt-get install g++-mingw-w64-x86-64 mingw-w64-x86-64-dev
* mkdir -p src &amp;&amp; cd src
* wget 
* unzip v0.14.0.uasfsegwit3.zip
* cd bitcoin-0.14.0.uasfsegwit3/depends/
* make HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32
* cd ..
* ./autogen.sh 
* CONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32/share/config.site ./configure --prefix=/
* make
* make install DESTDIR=/mnt/d/bitcoin
Then the file was in d:bitcoin/bin/bitcoin-qt.exe

Hi again, I did update to the last firmware and the ledger nano S does display the address and ask for confirmation. So yes it's rock solid.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:20:46
I just asked the the CTO of Ledger, he told me it's impossible.

MacOS too.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:21:37
I'm not sure, I didn't use it for a year. I'll check tonight. Also be sure to have the latest version.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:56:43
Everyone is already telling you : There is no way you would have them today because you would have sold them. So the price is irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:32:08
You cannot be hacked using a ledger nano S. The private key never leave the secure element. It doesn't matter the computer you use is totally compromised.
You can only get beaten physically until you give the pin code or the seed.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:34:39
The chrome app doesn't sign the transaction, it is already signed by the hardware before arriving in the app that is here only to display it.
You must therefore verify if the address is correct on the hardware itself. If it is right, nothing can happen.
