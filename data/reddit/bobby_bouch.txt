It is gambling because the price move cannot be reasonably predicted or appraised.
Edit: Also, read the intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham if you want to understand the thought process behind how people like Warren Buffer make decisions.

Surely not. That would mean the government knew his bitcoin balance at the start of the year? 
For regular investments you get statements which show income from dividends, growth, interest etc.
Not sure how taxes work for btc but that doesn’t seem right.

Absolutely nothing in that article mentions anything about any hedge funds jumping in.

To be fair 90% of the articles on this subreddit are opinion pieces from obscure, unknown and unverified sources.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:31:23
The article doesn’t actually provide any info on hedge funds jumping in. Also experienced investors are just that, investors. Anyone jumping in right now is a gambler.

Pretty much, until crypto is stable and predictable it will never become a currency. Everyone here is expecting this to be the currency of the future... and it’s incredible.
Businesses need money to pay bills, wages, run their operation, no one is going to accept a form of payment with as much risk and volatility as crypto long term. Some may experiment, get burned once and be done with it. Most small to medium businesses run on low enough margins where they wouldn’t risk the crypto volatility when they need the liquid cash to keep their business going.

FUD influences all markets.
Fear - Crypto is new territory and scary.
Uncertainty - Crypto is certainly uncertain as many things depend on government reactions and the future uncharted waters.
Doubt - With recent price drops people aren’t so sure it’s the moon ship they thought it was.
People refer to FUD as some gaslighting scheme by the haters. But really it is the most basic foundation of investing.

People keep throwing out FUD like it’s some kind of gaslighting technique. FUD was always used in unstable stocks and market situations.
Crypto is FUD itself... there is always uncertainty in crypto, it’s not an investment it’s a gamble.

Believing in the technology does not mean bitcoins price should just rise forever. 
Really, there is no value in bitcoin. The only thing that gives it value is other people willing to buy it. If no one wants bitcoin it can go to 0, if everyone wants bitcoin it can go to 100,000.
Blockchain technology’s success is not tied to the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:09:44
There is no rationale, it’s 100% hype and expectation. You can’t place a fair value on crypto coins like you can on a stock, it’s worth whatever people will pay for it.

They’re memeing to hodl for their own sake in hopes the price stops dropping. Some people are hodling some aren’t.

This does not apply to crypto.
We don’t know what down is. This concept works for stocks because there is intrinsic value. There are assets, income etc. that can be broken down into a fundamental value. So you can have an idea where the bottom is.
With crypto your blindfolded on a roller coaster screaming buy every time you go downhill.

You kill bitcoin, you kill crypto.
Like it or not bitcoin is the poster child of crypto.
Regular people have never heard of alt coins, but almost everyone has heard of bitcoin. So when news spreads that BItcoin is dead, billions of assets wiped out, no one will touch crypto with a 10’ pole.

Regular market is worth like 20 Trillion, most investment and retirement accounts are invested. A stock market slide effects everyone and their mother, crypto doesn’t. 
Yes it’s a minor slide, but a lot more people care about the stock market than bitcoin.
