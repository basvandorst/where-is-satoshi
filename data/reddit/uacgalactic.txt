Is the vendor really dumb though?
Or maybe the vendor has to put a roof over his head and can’t afford such lofty outlooks? 
Last I checked you can’t pay a mortgage with anything thats untied to the us dollar. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:13:39
What other mortgages are there? 
I get what youre trying to say but some of these sentences seem a little unrealistic. 
Maybe one day the dollar wont matter but as we live now its a requirement. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:50:08
How are dollars meaningless? 
Do you survive on Bitcoin? 
Even if you did - the fact that its worth less evaporates your purchasing power. 
How is that meaningless? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:59:54
“Bitcoin is money”
But the vendors that accept it price things in relation to the dollar. 
So if bitcoins value drops then its less valuable as money. 
If i have a rock and yesterday i could buy a loaf of bread with it but today i cant - the fact that i still have a rock isnt much of a consolation. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:15:28
As correct as you may be - im sitting on some heavy depression. 
I could lose all my crypto tomorrow and be fine - but had i sold more in december i couldve doubled my holdings. 
Hodl hodl hodl.... but all I did was watch money evaporate. Im angry and annoyed. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:34:44
Can you elaborate on this for me please?
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:48:58
Oh is that it?
Or is it ‘one of my assets is worth a lot fucking less than it was a month ago’ ?
Hmm. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:23:51
I believe in both. I dont think Bitcoin will replace the dollar. But i still like the idea of being able to send infinite sums of money around the world and be my own bank etc. 
My problem isnt with bitcoin - its with this HODL mentality. I cashed some out in december as a reward to myself but held onto the rest. 
The first dip i held on. Resisted a panic sell. 
Then another dip. Held on. Hodl hodl hodl right? 
Holding = watching money evaporate. Its annoying. 
I feel stupid complaining as im technically still way above my initial investment but its getting to the point where im just gonna dump it all as its hard to think itll ever see 20k again. 
But maybe my mood will change :) 
At least I feel alive. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:47:45

@_date: 2018-05-31 13:19:32
Because you're storing your private keys in figurative 'plain sight' on network connected hardware which is vulnerable to malware, key loggers, etc. 
Even a secure PC running good antivirus software is still nowhere near the level of security provided by something like a Ledger. 
Put it this way, if the amount of crypto you hold would upset you if lost forever, then it should be on a hardware wallet. Some wallet developers even openly say NOT to use their wallets for holding large amounts of crypto for long term. Exodus is a fantastic wallet but their devs even openly say not to use it for large/long term storage.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:45:37

@_date: 2018-06-08 22:12:31
lol of course there is. Don't listen to this foolishness. I've held physical bullion of all denominations large and small and you can easily sell it back to the bank for market value. The only loss is the fee they charge you to authenticate that you're giving them real bullion and not hunks of lead. You wait a few days and when that's done your account is credited. 
Dunno what this guy is talking about "50% loss" that's absolute hogwash.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:40:12
That's a weak response to a genuine question. 
You have a lot to say when you're boasting about this magic money but when somebody asks you why you say "logic" as if it's something a 5 year old should know? Please. That's weak as fuck and you know it. 
So I ask you again - why should anybody believe that Bitcoin will moon again? Lay it out for me. You understand it well right? So explaining it shouldn't be a problem for you. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 04:41:49
Still waiting for you to explain your statement. 
Who is losing? 
What is being lost?
Who is "they"
Can you actually back any of this up or do you just post this in the hopes that it might pump the price of Bitcoin? 
Let me save you the trouble;
Nobody is scared, no powers that be take Bitcoin that seriously. The price has fallen because we're in a bear market - not because it's being suppressed by anybody. There's no volume, no interest in crypto among the general public, and no FOMO money pouring in. 
Now stop with these silly conspiracies about POWERS THAT BE.

I haven't sold to multiple banks, only the bank which I've purchased from. But most major banks I know of have precious metal services where they buy/sell gold bullion. Not every branch handles this but if you bring it to a branch that doesn't they ship it to the one that does (also for a small fee).
If you walk into a bank that offers these services with a kilogram of gold bullion they will gladly purchase it from you. They'll also sell you a kilo of gold if you want as well. Or a half kilo. or 10oz. bar. or 5oz bar or 1oz ingot, or half oz. or 1/20oz 'chip'. etc. There's all types.

Are you trying to say that anything in life that's had brainpower, money and resources thrown at it is fail-proof?
I sure hope not. 
Also past bubbles correcting and price succeeding previous all time highs does not guarantee the trend will forever continue. You seem smart enough so I'm sure you realize why nothing you said constitutes as "convincing". 
You basically said "its gone up before so it will again" It may. But it also may not.
And "it's had so much money and time thrown at it, it can't fail!" Also false. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:45:24
I've been here longer than 5 years I don't need to zoom out on anything. 
The point is just because ATHs were reached in the past does not mean the trend will forever continue - it may, but it also may not. 
Also if you think this isn't going much lower before it sees any type of correction you're mistaken. 
But good luck.

@_date: 2018-06-07 14:25:44
The article you attempted to link was what I already referenced. Are you slow? 
That “exploit” doesn’t involve obtaining private keys - it has to do with patching a device with hacked firmware which requires physical access and then a specific transaction via software has to be accepted. This does not equate to being able to obtain private keys. 
Basically it requires 100x the effort to pull off plus physical access to the device than it would be for a hacker to get keys off a software wallet. Yet... your method is safer? LOL.

Wtf are you talking about “magic”? You don’t think priv keys have been obtained through malware exploits?! 
Lololol. 
Do some research and it might actually scare you when you learn how easy it is to pull privkeys out of software wallets. 
Also your anecdotal experience is meaningless. That’s like saying “I’ve never worn a seatbelt in my whole life and look at me I’m still alive!!”
Your advice should never be followed. Go do some reading. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:40:23
Lol if the private keys were compromised before the encryption then what good is the encrypted file?! 
A hacker would already have access. 
The only way this would work would be if the hardware used prior to the encryption was never connected to the internet and had been totally isolated from any potential malware. And since it was an Android phone that’s not the case. 
Also please show me where a Ledger’s private keys have been extracted from the device itself? If that was possible the company would be bankrupt by now. 
The only exploit was months back which involved the potential for faulty firmware to be installed should the device fall into the wrong hands - which is a far cry from being able to extract private keys from an uncompromised device. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 01:49:32
That’s not what cold storage is. You’re just copy/pasting wallet files from a potentially compromised/ vulnerable device to a USB drive. That’s not cold storage and the keys would technically not be considered uncompromised. 
Cold storage means the private keys have never been exposed to any device that touches or has ever touched the internet. 
A Ledger Nano is cold storage because by architecture, the private keys never leave the device regardless of what you plug it into. That’s “Cold Storage”. 
If your android wallet was compromised - and you back it up on USB keys - I can still take your private keys and steal your coins tomorrow, next year, in 5 years - regardless of you backing it up. 
Get a Ledger for piece of mind.

@_date: 2018-03-11 23:27:51
Because although newer currencies may have technical features that seem superior at first glance, many of them are centralized tokens that are in essence the exact opposite of what makes Bitcoin valuable. 
Bitcoin is a proven, tested, resilient, decentralized, immutable cryptocurrency. Most other ICOs and tokens have pretty websites and captivating descriptions but the reality is very very few of them have been tested the way Bitcoin has - and most are nothing more than tokens of a company or group trying to turn a profit. 
I'm sure people can answer your question better than I can - but just keep in mind that if the entire value of a crypto was only in it's ability to transact with merchants - then no crypto would really be worth anything because we already have American Express. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:14:09
FUCKING LOL @ people losing their shit over a $1000 drop. Give it time buckos, you'll get to a point where a $2000 drop or gain in either direction doesn't even make you blink.

You are twisting the words of the tweet. He never said he wished that they told him first. He said that its untrue first of all - and then goes on to explain that it would make no sense for Japan to speak to media before handing down a mandate to Binance themselves whilst in the midst of open dialogue. He's trying to spell it out for people so they realize how ridiculous the fake news is. But from that you ascertained "HE WISHED THEY TOLD HIM FIRST!" "First" would imply that there was anything to tell - which is false, and you've twisted it that way to try and suit your narrative. But you've failed because people here are too smart for this pre-school level garbage. You are a failure at spreading FUD. You're no good. Give it up.

But Bitcoin was already being accepted places years before the big rush of 2017, and that alone didn't cause the price to go parabolic. 
You know what DID? The thought that bitcoin could make you rich quick. That brought in all that FOMO money from people who had since never heard of bitcoin and didn't understand it. All they knew was that it was shooting up in value and they wanted in. It was the first time that it caught on in the media like that and it fueled that hysteria. 
Think of it this way - what did you hear being talked about more last fall; they fact that a select few vendors accepted BTC? Or that the price of Bitcoin was exploding?

You might be right in some regard but on the flip side the only reason we skyrocketed to 20k was because dumb money stormed in without understanding anything. 
That's kinda the opposite of fud - equally as ignorant just on the other side of the coin. Without that type of FOMO dumb money flooding in Bitcoin will sink back down to $1000 again, because why wouldn't it?
I'm bullish in the long run but let's not kid ourselves - these markets NEED that FOMO money to reach new ATHs. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:31:36
Totally feel that too, tbh. I feel like at the end of the day we could all get beers. Then make some drunken trades like true crypto Chads. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:57:05




People made money when it went from $0.08 to $20 as well. OMG WHY ARE THEY STILL HERE?!?!?


Your nonsensical incoherent rambling will answer that question for you.

Except you don't. I've outlined your lie in the previous post. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:54:40
Why should it cost anything? Why should it cost $100? $20 $0.01? 
Because the market decides that's what it's worth. 
Because it's the only deflationary cryptocurrency backed up by 9 years of rock solid decentralized attack-resilient immutability.
When the market decides others are worth that much then that will be the price they trade for.
Hilarious how the FUD comes out of the concern-trolling disguise once you present some facts. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:15:38
The pumping and dumping is so damn aggressive today.

Yeah, Reddit is what's making Bitcoin volatile....
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:29:59


That was and is true regardless of any vulnerability. You NEVER use a seed that's given to you and not generated by the actual device itself. Regardless of what device/wallet it is.

The crushing feelng here isn’t so much the price (because yes as you said we are still up) but the general feeling that the dreams of Bitcoin reaching $100k, $500k etc are seeming like a thing of the past. 
It was the FOMO normie money that shot bitcoin towards $20k and now the general sentiment is that Bitcoin is dead and has tanked. Not amongst those of us who have been here for years - but amongst your average joe. 
And that matters more than anything. Without that sweet FOMO money we aren’t going to see 20k again regardless of how good the fundamentals are. 
Lightning? Yeah cool. Sadly until people can use it to buy their Venti Frappuccino at Starbucks - it won’t really matter in terms of moving the price upwards. 
Bitcoin rocketed in the fall because people thought they could get rich quick when they saw how it paid off for people who held through the years where nobody even knew what a bitcoin was. The moment it clicked that investing AFTER it went mainstream was nowhere near as profitable and much riskier - money exited fast. 
Inb4 “price doesn’t matter” bois 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:54:30
every new low we hit it's "strong support here!"
Gonna hit $1000 and people will still be like "strong support @ $1000! moon soon!"
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:52:08
The MAIN point to make here is there's no NEW money entering the market like back then. 
It's either whales doing their thing or people with cash sitting on the sidelines from selling at a profit waiting to buy back in. 
Bitcoin needs NEW money to really have another round of sustained growth. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:22:03
Hope comes when we pass 12k and hold there for a couple of weeks. 
These are nothing but whale games.

Correct. 
However it's not Satoshi. It's just one or two or 5 whales taking some profit out after the 2-week runup.

Below $7800 and falling fast :(
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:09:40
Yeah pretty scary. This was critical and we cut through it like butter. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:05:15
As cool as LN is - it won't take us to an all time high unless it has widespread adoption that triggers another wave of FOMO money. 
9/10 of the average people don't know or care about LN and aren't going to rush out to buy BTC just because some new tech they can't grasp has been implemented UNLESS it's so widely adopted that places like Starbucks start accepting Bitcoin via LN - but that may take some time as the general sentiment towards Bitcoin in the public is less than ideal. 
You hit the nail on the head when you said the momentum is dead for now. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 12:14:13
Why dont you explain it to me. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:59:01
Literally looks like a Tether printing. Very odd and non organic spike.

@_date: 2018-03-27 14:41:47
Reddit isn't a record of my wealth nor will it be anything I ever divulge to a stranger. 
As I said, assume I'm rich. Assume I'm poor. Assume I'm middle class. I really REALLY don't care.
The basis of all your arguments fall apart not because of money people have or haven't made - but because the same fear was spread and used as a tool of jealousy and to drive prices down back in 2014 when Bitcoin lost over 80% of its value from $1000 to $250.
If people listened back then to people like you now they would've missed out on even greater returns.
I've been there before, you're nothing new. You're nothing I haven't seen before. You're not saying anything relevant or important. Just more of the same noise in the bearish months of a repetitive cycle. I'm not even mad at you, actually you're probably angry because in your mind you think you missed out on immense profits so in a way I feel bad for you. 
Just go find another hobby, FUD as you may you have literally zero impact on the price. The real impactful FUD comes from institutions and governments, not some nobody on Reddit. Spend your energy elsewhere trust me.
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:50:57
That’s actually really interesting. 
More like this. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:30:45
Absolutely not. 
Which is why I keep saying this is a market of utter manipulation and zero organic growth and zero new money. 
Pay attention. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:08:42
To be fair - the tapering off we’re seeing looks more like people taking some profit after buying @ $7300 than it does a flat iut dump. 
Not saying that couldnt be right around the corner... but doesnt seem like an orchestrated dump just yet. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:27:06
Yeah these sporadic massive green whale candles are FOMO....yup.... Healthy organic market behavior.
No manipulation or pump/dump action here. 100% certified organic growth. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:54:26
Don't be shocked if there's a second wave of dumping soon. Many people slow to the draw the first time around are going to wait for the price to bounce back again and then take their profit. 
Just be cool. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:54:49
There’s LOTS out there.
Start by binge watching Andreas Antonopolous’ lectures on youtube. Read the whitepaper. Do some digging. Look at both sides objectively. Even the FUD. Examine it all. Then decide what’s right. 
Avoid these silly tabloid articles as theyre almost always written by hacks with a pre-school level understanding of Bitcoin/crypto. 
One of them was written by a guy who thought Bitcoin was a company. That’s the type of shit you gotta wade through. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:19:13


The average Joe and Stacy don't invest at all. And when they do - it's infinitely easier to do via their banks which they know and trust and absolve them of all worries. 
edit: and let me clarify - because you mistook my point. I'm not saying that buying coffee has to happen. I have cash and a debit card to buy coffee. I don't need crypto. Nor does anybody. My POINT was that the only way LN will catch on and attract new money from casual people not involved in this community is if it has a very very practical application - such as purchasing day to day items like coffee. That was the point. 


Not my leader, nor do I support him or his altcoin. Don't assume I'm a troll just because I hit you with some reality. I've probably been bullish on Bitcoin for longer than you can imagine.
Why do you keep bringing up Bcash? This isn't about Bcash. Did you even comprehend what I said?
Stop accusing anybody who doesn't participate in a circlejerk as a BTC troll. It's weak.
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:08:12
That depends. Its all relative.
For some 0.5btc is a grail. 1btc for others. Then some are trying to reach the “21” club where owning 21btc would put you in the 1 of only 1million people that could ever own that many.

The fact that we've been on a steady decline since December without revisiting the ATH is your first clue. 
Make no mistake - I don't think it's impossible to get there again, but the market needs new money from casual investors the way it saw in the fall.

@_date: 2018-03-27 13:50:14
And they'll probably be right. 
edit* just a little context - I've been into this for a looong time now. Once upon a time somebody told me that a single Bitcoin would potentially be worth $10,000. I literally laughed at the thought. It was just as absurd 6 years ago as the sound of $1 million now. I hoped it would, but no part of me in any sense thought that was anywhere near possible. I thought winning the lottery would happen sooner than 1BTC = $10k.
...and here we are in 2018 complaining and moaning about how Bitcoin has "TANKED" down to 8k from $20k. 
So now when I hear figures like $500,000, $1 million... I'm not as dismissive. If Bitcoin has taught me one thing it's that what seems like ridiculous speculation today may be the price you wish you bought at in a few years.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:22:54

This is retarded. Do what you must but please dont do it based on some retarded article like this. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:09:05
Ive been crushed. But 9/10 times I profit. Trading is about managing risk while leveraging the assets you hold - not timing absolute highs or absolute bottoms. Even the best traders always leave a little money on the table. 
If you do it right, dont trade with your whole stack, apply leverage, you win. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 23:32:48
It wouldn't drive it up, it would drive it down. 
For instance, you see massive sell wall and think "shit some whale knows something I don't and is trying to dump his stack in one blow - fuck I better dump mine too!" So you start putting up sells and the next guy does etc etc. Panic spreads, people start wanting to dump quicker than the next guy so they outpace the next guy with a slightly lower price, the sooner the better!
...all this without a dollar being spent or moved. Then price drops and sells are pulled and whale buys all the cheap coins that you just panic dumped. 
This is the intended result. I'm over simplifying it since there's other things and many many bots at play, but in essence that's how massive walls are used to intimidate or goad a response out of inexperienced traders. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:06:31
$8100 inbound. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:41:37

Which is why in my opinion - thinking that Lighting Net. is going to drive the price upwards on its technical merit alone is false. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:31:51
Good. Let them panic sell. They are free to do so. If harmless comments on reddit are what bring the price of Bitcoin down then the coin has truly failed.

So if you paid $20,000 for that bitcoin - and tomorrow it’s worth zero - you won’t care at all? 
The fact that you still have the coin is going to make up for the fact that you’ve lost $20,000 worth of leverage? 
Please stop with this nonsense. I’m overall bullish on BTC but this shit is nothing but bagholders cope. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:13:07
Anybody who thought we would soar past 9k without a bit of dumping and profit taking is a fool. 
Anybody who thinks this dip signals a reversal of the upwards trend we've been seeing in the last couple days is a fool. 
When it falls below $8500 and keeps going then you can start worrying. (even then I wouldn't 'worry' tbh) Until then stfu about a laughable $300 recline. 
Stop acting like children with the petulant hand-wringing every time the price isn't moving upward. Have some dignity people.

@_date: 2018-03-30 17:07:24


No, sorry that's not what it was. The average normie who FOMOd in didn't know what a futures contract was or what it meant. 
It was the lure of quick money and getting rich overnight. That lure is stronger than any tech, any advancement, any Lightning Network, any futures, etc. Nothing compares to dumb FOMO money.

Actually I'm the guy that told people not to buy at $9200 because we were going lower. 
Worked out well for me. 
I also think we may not have seen the bottom of this. 
Once again, zoom out, look at the 15m chart. There's 3 easily definable false bottoms we've had that look exactly like this morning where people thought we were moonbound again. And they were wrong. 
This may be the bottom, or it may not, but anybody saying they know it is is lying since there's nothing about today that has shown clear definite signs of not being a bull trap. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:45:07
That's what people said yesterday when I said it was going beneath $8500.
There's zero critical support @ $8k. The next solid support level is in the 5-6k range. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:18:13
When it cracks 13k again and holds we can celebrate. A few hundred bucks upwards after falling 11k to 7.5k isnt a reason to jump for joy but some of you idiots have very short memories. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:48:44
If you're going to dole out advice at least learn the difference between a bull trap and a bear trap or you'll sound really really dumb.

Slow steady variance over a certain time period without random massive buys that happen in a matter of seconds that are almost always followed by massive amounts of coins dumped in very close amounts. 
Did you watch the charts during the fall when the real FOMO money was flooding in? Even with that the rise from day to day was gradual. 
What we're seeing here isn't FOMO its whale games. People are getting played like fiddles.

You're rambling on about nothing. I don't care what you do in regards to tax or what you don't do. I really really don't. 
But you made a statement implying that "tax" was a method that could be used to hinder crypto. This makes no sense as crypto profit is already taxed. 
Now you're babbling about offshore accounts as if I ever stated otherwise?

You don't have to time the market perfectly to trade and make profits. Trust me I know. 
This is a misconception people have. Making profitable swing trades is easier than most people think especially on the way down. It's predictable as clockwork.  
But you're right - for the average person holding is best.

@_date: 2018-03-14 15:17:40
It may have been - but the amount of "such and such is why it's crashing!" talk I see here is ridiculous. 
Even amongst strong FUD (China ban, Korea ban, hacks etc) Bitcoin STILL managed to rally and trend upwards back in the fall. Know why? NEW MONEY. New fresh FOMO money is what moves Bitcoin upwards; remove that and it slips back down to early 2017 prices.
Very simple.

Yeah I mean I didn't mean to get super deep or anything. Just kinda reminding people to take everything in context. It's very easy to think you have the worst luck in the world when it comes to money. The feeling of losing money is abysmal - and it makes it easy to forget how big a deal it isn't.

@_date: 2018-03-22 14:56:37
In layman's terms:
A slight rise in price after a significant drop that falsely signals the price is going to skyrocket when in reality it's just creeping up before another dump. It 'traps' bulls into buying more to bump the price a little bit before bears dump their coins and make even more money. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:55:40

There very well might be, however that money needs a reason to come back. 
In the fall the reason was because people thought they could get rich overnight. Nobody cared about the tech, they came to make money. 
Now we need a new reason to have people flood back in. What will that reason be? When will it come? 3 months from now? Maybe. 3 years from now? Maybe. Nobody can say. 
I'll say this though - if Bitcoin price thrived on tech alone a single coin would already be worth over $50,000.

@_date: 2018-03-25 23:18:27
If Bitcoins price was tied exclusively to good news - it would be over $100,000 already. 
Unfortunately, market manipulation, profit taking, and uncertainty make this more complicated and draw things out. The market is bearish these days - which isn't really bad, just part of the overall cycle thats repeating itself. Consider it a good time to buy.
Check this. 
Also don't get fooled by sell walls - a sell wall can be put up to intimidate buyers and vice versa and pulled at will.

@_date: 2018-03-28 20:05:04
Correct. 
Which is why your comment was retarded. If small denominations of Bitcoin can be purchased then the price at the specific time is irrelevant. 
You're saying people won't buy at $15k but they'll buy at $3k? Why? If I want to put X amount of money into bitcoin because I believe it will rise by a certain percentage then the dollar per BTC is a non issue. 
Use your brain next time.  
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:53:54
No I wont shit my pants I promise you. 
It could fall to $1000 tomorrow and I’d still be far in the green. But thanks for your concern. 
Moreso, a reversal back to the 6k support level would only delay the inevitable return to previous and new heights once the next wave of investors pours in. I agree 6k is very possible. Maybe even 5.5k. Ive preached this possibility for the last few days in here myself. 
Bitcoin has crashed before, it will crash again. And agin. And again. 
What history actually shows is that the crashes only propel it to greater heights in thr long run. 
So that’s why you and your deliberate FUD are harmless and try as you may, ultimately ineffective. 
I also browsed your comment history and saw that amidst the constant fudding, you got out of Bitcoin during the Gox era - which is very telling - if I sold @ $1000 id FUD too in hopes the price would fall back down. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:55:04
I could try but it would fly way over your head. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 02:27:40
Never bearish. Just realistic. 6k was a real possibility (and still is) until we’re firmly above 9k. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:48:27
That all depends if it continues upwards or trends further downwards. 
If we rally up on a bull run from here then yes people who sold the bottom got burned. 
But if we dip further down to $6k levels then selling  will turn to serve those people well. 
Selling the dip is no dumber than buying the dip if bigger drops are on their way. Question is do you believe they are or not? 
There tends to be this sentiment that selling during a dip is wrong and that's because people always assume it's going to bounce up and higher. But there have been many dips sold that didn't turn out to be the bottom. 
So on either side - nobody knows for sure. One could claim that buying @ $7500 may turn out to be just as foolish granted they didn't plan to take profit when it pumped again.

6k is looking less and less likely now. A week ago I was calling for a 6k bottom but the support @ the low $8000s is too strong. 
You could wait and see if it dips by sunday but tbh if you plan to hold for a year, 2 years etc, then whether you buy in now or a fee hundred dollars less is irrelevant. Just jump in it’ll feel good.
Don’t worry too much if it dips after you buy. In a year or two youll be glad you did. (Probably ;) )
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:12:01


You sound like somebody who's either lost money or hasn't made enough to know how good it feels. 
Once you get that rush there's no going back. Save your MUH YOU JUST DONT GET IT - I get it believe me. I've probably been involved in Bitcoin longer than you (think early days). 
But this idea that purchasing power of an asset doesn't matter is ludicrous. Absolute nonsense. 
If the dollar collapsed tomorrow and we had to use BTC to pay for things - how would we price things? If person A charged 5 bitcoins for a loaf of bread - and person B charged 1 bitcoin - would you buy from A or B? Why?
How would we attach a price to anything unless we determine a value of the commodity we use to purchase it? We would have to agree that the commodity had purchasing power. Now if I stripped that commodity of all purchasing power overnight you wouldn't mind? How would you use it to pay for anything then?
It's the same thing on a less extreme scale now with a USD amount attached to it. 
Yeah the dollar may be inflationary but it's not going to inflate by 50% overnight. Bitcoin however, can easily deflate in value by 50% overnight regardless of the fact that it's deflationary by nature. 
There's an altruistic way of looking at it - which is you. And then there's reality. 
But this is all besides the point because daytrading this fuckin thing is FUN and EASY and PROFITABLE. Don't like profit? Are you a communist?

Because dumb money is easily confused and frightened. Just as fast as people latched onto the dream that they would get rich overnight - they quickly realized they could also lose everything overnight. So panic kicked in and they began exiting with the little profit (or losses) they made. 
Smart money knows that things move in cycles - dumb money thought Bitcoin would skyrocket upwards forever. Dumb money always gets stung. Smart money took profits when the writing was on the wall that the price was parabolic and unsustainable. 


The long answer is when it has a reason to. Right now all the average person knows about Bitcoin is that "it crashed" - even though technically it's way up from this time in 2017. But specifics don't matter, perception is reality. In late 2017 money poured in because the perception was that Bitcoin would make you rich quick - and that was partly true granted you knew when to get while the getting was good. Now the perception is less optimistic - it generally ranges from "Bitcoin is dead" to "Bitcoin tanked!" or "I told you it was a scam"
These are not the type of buzzwords that generate FOMO money.
The short answer? In a month. In 6 months. In 2 years. Maybe never.

Those of us who lived through the previous crashes know that 25k is peanuts. Not only can Bitcoin reach 25k but much higher is easily attainable. 
People who had never heard of Bitcoin until last Fall and only saw it go from 20k to 7k will think that such a speculation is insane. But they aren't aware of the rally to $1000 in 2014, and the subsequent plummet to $250 - and then the rise back to $3000 in the early fall.
When you've seen the cycle repeat itself its easier to grasp a better outlook on the long term of this thing.

The difference is my strategy is proactive - where what you’re talking about involves sitting and hoping price goes up. 
I’m fine with preaching HODL - just as long as in the same sentence you make sure people know there’s also a realistic chance of Bitcoin bleeding out until it’s worth $1000 again.

Complaining that you can't buy everything or pay for a $1 coffee with Bitcoin right now would be similar to complaining that you can't stream a 4K video over the internet in 1997. 
That was impossible at the time due to the infrastructure of ISPs and the hardware made available to consumers. However, this didn't mean that the internet 'failed' did it? It was simply in it's early stages. This is what's going on now with the bitcoin/cryptocurrency space. 
Saying "I can't do X with Bitcoin right now so it's a failure!!!" is just as silly. Technology doesn't go from non-existence to peak-of-application overnight. It takes years and years. 
So educate yourself, and have patience - or don't. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:55:58
Conversion to FIAT is a reality at this stage of early adoption since more vendors accept dollars than BTC. If BTC was widely accepted the need to convert it to dollars wouldn't exist. This is just simple logic. 
Just like when the internet was new - you couldn't stream 4k video. You couldn't download a system update in 20 seconds. There was lots you couldn't do.
Once upon a time we couldn't talk on cell phones either. But technology improves, grows and eventually becomes widely adopted.
Things have never gone from not existing to existing at the peak of their application. Never. Not once. 
I'm not even going to insult you - but when you try to make these arguments you just make yourself sound old and outdated. 
Here I'll help you out because I believe in helping the uneducated; if you want to make a GOOD argument against Bitcoin specifically - then get into the specifics of how other coins provide the same application with far more efficiency. You'll probably get knocked down on those points too but at least then you'll sound as if you have an argument to make and not just like an out of touch no-coiner.
This is my final reply. Be thankful you got these many keyboard strokes out of me.

Who’s telling you to switch to anything? Bitcoin isn’t a replacement for banks at this time. 
The point is that it’s silly to bark about the high fees at Bitcoin ATMs when the reasons for it are pretty simple to understand. Banks don’t have fees this high at their ATMs for a multitude of reasons - but mostly because they net Billions of dollars in revenue from other channels. ATMs save banks money by allowing them to pay fewer salaries. The ATM isnt the product - the banking services are. Where as Bitcoin ATMs ARE the product. The ATM IS the service - and using them comes at a direct cost.
That’s the difference and I hope youre able to grasp it.

Because the supply is limited. The purchasing power of 1btc is still 1btc. Market value in USD is ultimately irrelevant when it comes to classing something as deflationary or inflationary.


If people want to hang onto it then they can. If they wan't to spend it they can. If mass adoption ever takes place the price will stabilize as we get closer to a true value tied more to supply and less to speculation. The price swings that exist now are not a property of Bitcoin - they're a property of the markets being unregulated and ripe for the picking.


Because it enables complete control over money without the use of 3rd parties. See above point.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:16:36
The problem is people get emotionally attached to Bitcoin as if it's a girlfriend. 
You buy when it's cheap. You dump the bags when it has exuberant runups. Yeah you're not going to time the market perfectly - but when you see it go from $4000 to $20,000 in less than 3 months you should know it's time to take some profit. 
Likewise when you see what's happening now you know it's a good time to pick up cheap coin. 
But if you listen to these people who scream HODLLLLLLLL you'd have missed out on a massive profit and/or opportunity to grow your holdings. 
But don't listen to me.... I'm just a FUDDER right boys?

But the Ledger isn’t just ‘showing’ the address from what I understand - its calculating it internally from the derivation path. This cannot be faked unless the hardware itself was compromised. 
So youre basically telling the Ledger hardware to make sure it can calculate the address the software app on your PC is displaying. If it can, youre good. 
Correct me if I’m wrong anyone. 
Also I just noticed you used the word exchange. Were you talking about online exchanges? If malware were to change that recieve address then yes that’s a problem but that has nothing to do with Ledger.

Profit is already taxed. 
What can be done is regulate/ban exchanges. If they make it extremity hard/near impossible to convert BTC into dollars then that's very bad. If it was deemed illegal to operate an exchange - that would be the death knell just about.
I don't think the government will ever ban Bitcoin or crypto but make no mistake they could do severe damage if they chose to.

Long term overall yes just holding is best. 
BUT. 
This tether thing is a real threat that may drop BTC another few thousand. It's not your everyday market volatility. It's not your everyday FUD. So people shouldn't behave like everyday HODLING is good enough.
One should - if not sell and buy back in later - at least assess the situation for what it is - or perhaps cash out his initial investment, or take some profit. Something in light of the special circumstances. 
If Tether is insolvent this is going to be worse than GOX was. So blindly sitting and saying HODL is a disservice. Instead of HODL people should say - "take a strong and close look at what's going on and make some calculated moves." 
I'm not saying to panic sell everything - but there are steps that can be taken to brace for such an event. 
That's why I start to cringe when I hear HODL over and over. But hey.... what do I know right?

The purchasing power of Bitcoin rises and falls due to volatility - not due to any inherent inflation.

I'm a big supporter of bitcoin who's been here longer than most but if you think people who bought at $20k haven't lost anything at this point you're living in a fantasy land. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:16:23
I never have been. I'm just realistic. Sometimes that involves discussing things that aren't so ideal.

You literally just repeated yourself and still don't understand what you're talking about. 
Bitcoin is just as useful being worth $100 as it is at $100,000. If it was worth $5 per coin tomorrow it would still serve the same purpose. The price it trades at has zero influence on how effective it is at being used for a purpose. The technology doesn't change just because today it trades @ $8k and last month it was $11k. Same tech. Same function. 


What the fuck are you even trying to say? It sounds like you're copy and pasting replies from Google translate.

Big if true. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:07:24
Also possible. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:49:44
Yeah tha'ts possible too. But that's a risk I'm willing to take. You can't ever time absolute bottoms. But a buy opportunity between now and 6k is good enough for me. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:15:26
So is this something that's only troublesome if you used the very first seed your Ledger spit out?
What if you've already reset your Ledger and generated a new seed beyond the initial seed it gave you. Is that considered safe? Or are they saying that EVERY seed generated before updating the firmware could be compromised?
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:08:53
That wasnt a wall that was a curb!

@_date: 2018-02-21 16:48:32
You are paying a premium for the convenience. Simple as that. And it's fair.
You are being allowed to buy Bitcoin 100% anonymously. This is a service that has operating costs. The machines also have to be built, serviced, maintained, etc. You are paying for that as well. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:20:23
Ethereum's network was brought to its knees by an app where people traded virtual cats. It's not exactly breaking much ground either. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:40:20
It may not reach absolute bottom of 2017 prices - but a return to $5k  levels is more than possible and looks more and more probable every day. 
And this is coming from somebody very bullish on BTC in the long term - but I can't see it returning to 15-20k anytime soon without a strong reset in price. 
Could be wrong. Could be right. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:54:27

BTC bout to go in dry on 9k support. WEEEEEEEEEEEE.
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:18:39


I know what you mean but this is the wrong term to use here lol
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:20:11
lol that's what people said about 10k
then 8k
then 7k
then it went as low as 6k - and you think $4500 is untouchable?
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:54:52
Good for you, champ. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:44:03
I duno. I mean it's possible but I really don't see it going that low. If it goes to $3k I'll literally buy every bitcoin I can at that price. It would be just like this.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:25:24
Yes you're correct and I know that. But the network doesn't give a fuck about itself. If people refuse to pay even $1 for a Bitcoin and mining grinds to a halt because it's no longer profitable - nothing is in stop to prevent this. 
That's my point. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:07:07
Zoom out. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:04:13
Hate to burst your bubble (no pun) - but LN won't do much for the price of BTC until your average Joe and Stacy can' pay for their Starbucks order with it from their phone. 
Casual money doesn't know or care about lightning network. What drives price is FOMO money from your average non-crypto geek. 
Until that comes back we are in a bear market. 
This isn't FUD, it's reality. I'm long on bitcoin but sometimes you have to face facts. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:00:17
If you're not worried about losing the money in the short term - then hold it. 
Save yourself the stress of trying to trade and time this. 
But if you feel ballsy and believe this will go to $6k (or lower) then sell and rebuy at a level you deem appropriate for you. 
It's up to you.
But if you try to time it you can fuck it up. 
If you hold you may watch your asset evaporate for now - but that won't matter if you believe in Bitcoin long term. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:44:13
That's why I said AROUND. I didn't say $8300 was bottom. It was below $8300 over an hour ago too.

@_date: 2018-03-12 17:51:13
Just because it bounces off an arbitrary amount for 30 minutes does not indicate there's "great support" at that level. That's not how this works, sorry. 
The next real STRONG support level beneath where we are is around $5-$6k. I know it sucks to hear but BTC could very easily slide back down to those levels and test $6k. 
There's support @ $8k but really with the sell volumes we've been seeing I don't know if $8k would hold for long should we revisit those levels. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:41:48

Lol people have been saying that since 10k. Lets just be honest with ourselves and say we dont know where the fuck this will bottom at. 
I say $5500-$6000
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:12:29
That made absolutely no sense whatsoever. 
A house is required for shelter and necessary in life. 
Bitcoin is required for nothing, used for nothing, and is something we speculate on and trade as a means to make money. 
If you think Bitcoin is intrinsically more valuable than a piece of land with a brick and mortar home on it then you’re fucking delusional. 
The housing market could be in the gutter and a house in the worst neighbourhood would still have more real world value than Bitcoin. 
I can’t believe I’m having this conversation. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:43:01
I'll care much less if the loss is over a 50 year period than over a 2-month period.

@_date: 2018-03-14 22:04:22
This HODL bullshit is poison. I’ve been daytrading the living fuck out of this for 3 days straight now as the writing was on the wall that it was headed for a sharp dive before any chance of a rebound - and have only multiplied my holdings. 
Had I listened to this HODLLLL mantra I’d literally be down 6 figure amounts. Sitting back with your thumb up your ass while your money evaporates may be how some people like to spend their day but not me. 
They say daytrading is risky? I think letting your wealth evaporate is riskier. 
Ffs people at least hedge SOME in dollars when you see this shit stirring. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:45:03


Except that's false. It's just mental gymnastics that help people when they're down. 
If I own a rock, and yesterday I could trade that rock for food - but today I can't - just because I still possess the rock doesn't mean I haven't 'lost' anything. I've lost the leverage of my asset. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:13:31
Im bullish on Bitcoin but that will honestly never happen. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:52:15

While I agree that overall OP shouldn’t be rubbing it in - in a way I’m glad that he is. 
Nobody talks shit like the “I told you its a scam!” crowd. So sometimes they need to eat their words
The truth is people don’t really think it’s a scam deep down- they just desperately want it to be because they missed the boat. 
People generally don’t like to see other people do well. This is one of the unfortunate realities of life. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:18:41
Well it just seems unrealistic. I wish I had a technical reason, but I dont. 
I can believe $50,000 by 2020. That sounds right. 
Do you think it will hit $1m? If so why? Genuinely like hearing all viewpoints on this. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:05:05
Or they'll have re-purchased cheap coins after selling at higher prices and making profit. 
Not everybody just sits and watches their money evaporate. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:38:50
This. I believe strongly in Bitcoin but the fact that we cut through 9k like butter isn’t a good sign at all. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:17:40
The 80% figure was an example. Not a literal figure for people who bought at $10k
In addition, your comment is one giant assumption that everybody bought at a price that will be reached again. "Oh just hold til you're back over!"
What about those people who bought at $19,000? How are they feeling right about now? "Oh just hold! simple!"
Not so simple for them when they're down over 50%.
edit: also hilarious that you were the guy whining yesterday about how the price drops for no reason - and now you're preaching hold like it's a simple formula for profit. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:20:54
Hype is what inflates the price - not lack thereof. 
The problem right now is there's no easily digestible hype that the masses can throw money at.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:55:43
Because it's a way that shitty traders/bagholders cope. They try and delude themselves into thinking that an asset losing monetary leverage is worth just as much because they still own it.

It shouldn't make you sick. It should wake you up. Smart money doesn't just sit by while assets evaporate.
What should make you sick are people telling you to HODL when we're on the precipice of a fucking Tether disaster. 
I can understand how long term daytrading is a bad idea - but when you have giant red flags like this Tether thing staring you in the face - sitting by and saying HODL is ridiculous. 
Not every situation is as simple as HODLLLL.

There are many reasons. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:55:47

Let's be honest if you bought @ $19k you'd be grasping at straws too. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:29:15
Honestly - and this is coming from a guy who loves and believes in bitcoin - we’re probably going to $6 -$7 k at this point. If you wouldve asked me a month ago is have said 9k - but after today yeah 9k aint holding for shit.

@_date: 2018-03-07 14:33:44
The vulnerability here has to do not with if you did or didn't create a seed yourself - but rather that if the device was compromised in a specific way - all the generated seeds may be pre-determined right out of the box - so they're all compromised. 
The safest thing to do here if you're ultra paranoid is to update the ledger with the new firmware, transfer all funds off of it to a temporary safe wallet, and then reset the device, generate a new seed with the new firmware, then transfer everything back to wallets generated off the new seed.

Oh and ps. Inflation does depreciate the purchasing power of the dollar - it just happens over a longer timeline. 
So not rly sure what your point is with that. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:32:04
Yes. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:23:41
Sad tbh
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:33:32
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:42:37
Volatility does not equal inflation. So right off the bat your understanding fails.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:42:31
Yeah OR sell now and buy back @ $5k. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:26:28
But thats only because volume is much lower isnt it?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:15:08
I totally agree. Not only are there cheap coins to be had - but you can daytrade the shit out of this downward volatility much easier than you can when the trend is bullish. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:56:45
I miss being at $300.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:20:50
Yeah people like to ignore this. Instead they just yammer on about HODLLLLLLL.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:57:54
lol @ "weak hands"
Selling last week and buying back in today would've been a great move. 
Selling now before the Tether fiasco blows wide open and then re-buying at a lower price may also be a good move. 
Having long term belief in Bitcoin doesn't mean sitting by with your thumb up your ass watching your money evaporate. 
Bitcoin fell through $10k support like it was made of paper and is about to touch the $8k realm again.
But don't do anything... just sit there and HODLLLLL
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:18:06
Maybe I'll write in whatever manner I damn well please. :)
Also frustration sets in after a long time. Initially I was much nicer. 
And no I wasn't laughing at anybody - I was replying to post the post saying buying Bitcoin was frustrating. That pales in comparison to the frustration of losing money. 
Advice: Worry less about what I do/type/say. Goodbye.

Well I guess at that point prices would see a jump. 
I don't know if that's more interesting - definitely more preferable - but pretty simple. 
The reason insolvency scares me is because it could compound the already grim state of things. 
I hope your hypothesis is true. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:18:53

@_date: 2018-03-19 18:52:12
6 and 5.5 would be golden buy opportunities. 
But should it dip that low I'd hope it rebounded fast because any drop below 5k and we have real problems.

That's a Tether/exchange issue - not a Bitcoin problem. 
Yes it may impact the price of Bitcoin in the short term but the core of Bitcoin's immutability remains unchanged. Tether can just as easily be used to purchase altcoins as well.

@_date: 2018-03-17 23:20:53
What you just said makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. There is no ‘built-in’ price to something as deflationary as bitcoin. 
It could’ve stayed at $0.50/coin and that would’ve been normal. 
It may reach $500,000 per coin in a few years and that will be just as normal. Market decides price. 


Wrong. The FOMO money that flooded into bitcoin last fall didn’t know what the fuck an altcoin was. You think all that money flooded into the market because the public cared about crypto as a whole? Lol the public barely knows about bitcoin let alone the 1500+ other altcoins out there. 
You need to pay closer attention.

I don't find joy in anyone's troubles. 
I'm just saying people should be thankful their situation isn't worse. 
Also the concept that just because you're still in possession of a depreciating asset means you haven't 'lost' anything is false. People should be more aware that then their assets have lost leverage in a market they have indeed 'lost'. 
My tone sounds the way it does because it's frustrating when people dismiss this advice as FUD.

The Ledger or Trezor are the hardware wallets. They generate a private key and give you a seed phrase to copy down and store securely. 
This seed phrase will generate your private keys and wallets on another hardware wallet or any hierarchical deterministic wallet anywhere. 
Nobody but you will ever have access to the phrase or the private keys (assuming the wallet hasn’t been tampered with or compromised). 
But no company or server stores your phrase or seed or keys. Those are generated on the spot when the wallet is in your posession.

And I don't say this in jest - I know losing money can blow. But keep in mind that there are far worse things in life. Think of all those people out there with medical problems, losing loved ones... fuck, a guy in my city the other week was randomly attacked on a subway by a guy with an icepick, and now he's blind in one eye. For nothing. Just random bad luck. 
I always keep shit like that in mind whenever my portfolio isn't soaring. Imagine what somebody else would give to trade their bad luck for your crypto losses.

Yeah its happened before but to say its commonplace without any bad news is ridiculous.

That “track record” applies only to inexperienced people who try to daytrade and fail. 
However what has been proven over and over is that those who have bought and held on for a period of years, not months or weeks, years -  have been rewarded greatly. 
The track record - as you put it - shows that Bitcoin always reaches a new high. There is ZERO evidence that a correction = doom. 
Since you’re a fan of track records you should digest what that means. 
I’ve been here since 2013 and every time corrections happen people yell doom and gloom and its dead and it’ll never be at $xxxx price again and bla bla bla bla bla. 
When youve lived through the market cycle 3 times already you can’t help but pity those who don’t see the larger picture.

@_date: 2018-04-05 23:41:00
Why is a $50 investment more logical than $5000? 
If I can afford to lose every penny of that money - then $5000 makes much more sense. If bitcoin doubles by the end of the year, i double my $5000. If it doesn’t, it doesnt matter. 
But if I put in $50 - if it doubles I only make $50 - and if I lose it it doesnt matter. So all things considered why wouldn’t I throw in the most I can afford to lose and stand a much higher chance of making more money? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:28:16

Not just in crypto, in stock and investment in general. Even in real estate - you don't buy the best house in the worst neighbourhood, you buy the worst house in the best neighbourhood. You buy cheap and ugly. You buy when buying isn't sexy. You vulture the stock when nobody wants it. When people call you an idiot for doing so. That's when you know it's the right time to buy. 
When I bought more in early 2015 after the big 2014 crash my friends laughed at me for buying something which had just lost 80% of its value. Bitcoin was dying. Dead. A lost cause. That's how I knew it was the perfect time to buy. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:27:01

@_date: 2018-04-06 12:54:24
Exactly. 
It's so easy to say buy the dip when the price is going parabolic but much harder to pull the trigger on buys when the price is on the way down. I remember in December people were praying for little dips here and there. Now bitcoin is almost 75% off and people are scared to take advantage.

Youre confusing logic with risk. 
A risky investment is not illogical so long as the investor has good reason to believe his money will grow. 
The problem here is you guys are taking a sum of money which to you is life changing, and applying it to an example (beanie babies) that you don’t believe will grow in value. But if $1 million was peanuts to you, and if deep down you had good reason to suspect beanie babies would double your money in a year - then there would be logic in the investment
The risk would be worth taking and is therefore logical. 
Illogical would be investing in something that you DIDNT think would make you money. That’s illogical. And if one thinks Bitcoin won’t ever make them money then they shouldn’t buy any. Not $5000 not $50 not $5. 
But if you truly believe it will increase in value then a $500,000 investment is just as logical as a $50 one - (more so actually) - provided that the loss of that money would have no impact on your life. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:59:12


Proceeds to try and convince me. 
How are your earnings 'shrinking' if you've been here since 2013?! 
Why didn't you sell in 2015 when Bitcoin tanked from $1200 to $200? Why is THIS the breaking point? Bitcoin lost more of its value in 2014 then it has in the last 3 months. 
See how you can tell who's really been here since 2013 and who hasn't?
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:30:44
Just like in 2014 when it rose to $1200 then fell to $200? 
People said the same thing. “WHOS GONNA EVER BUY THIS AGAIN?!?!”
That was in early 2015. $200usd. Imagine people like me who didnt listen to people like you and bought coins @ $200. 
As I said, you sound new and inexperienced. But once youve seen the exact same scenario play out 3 times already and have profited from the ignorance of others again and again, you start to feel bad for those who don’t get it.

@_date: 2018-04-09 13:07:57
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:36:44
Actually its not. 
What matters when buying Bitcoin are percentages involved - not dollar amounts. If throwing $6000 at it is unreasonable - then so is $600, $60 or $6. 
If one can afford to lose the money with zero change to his or her lifestyle then $6000 makes as much sense as $60. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:48:47

Any investment is logical as long as the investor believes they will make money. 
If you’re saying that Bitcoin will never increase in value again which is what makes it illogical- then I disagree and our conversation ends here. 
If you’re saying that investments are only logical if a return is all but guaranteed - then you don’t understand investing. 
If you’re saying that the logic of an investment decreases with the dollar amount invested then I disagree there too. 
If you believe Bitcoin will reach new highs in the future then buying as much as you can afford to lose right now makes total logical sense. If you think Bitcoin is really worth 0 then its illogical to invest a singal dollar. 
There are no other scenarios. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:43:57

The fact that I could, in theory, carry an unlimited amount of money in my head with me via private seed, anywhere in the world and be able to access my assets wherever I was and send them anywhere else in the world. Zero dependency on any bank or financial service; no need to carry anything physical. It blew my mind. It was like email for money - except I didn’t need to have an account with anyone anywhere. 
The technology was so cool and unheard of I wanted to be a part of it. This was in 2013.
