But still the community should be aware of the tactics, be better educated for us to be successful!

Care to explain intelligent species?
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:45:18
Well I bought  not the right decision but still waiting for 2 days to hope it takes a swing...
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:34:47
There is a great history behind it! Go google!
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:51:08
That is for verification, I did the same in bitstamp.net and all was good once I uploaded the photo. But not sure about ur site, it did go through simplex for payment when I did mine.
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:45:30
Bitstamp.net ...EU based, licensed and insured! Haven't had a problem so far, except the fees will be 6%... processing goes through simplex.. so first time you will have to upload some docs to verify.

I wonder the significance of three zeros after a dot
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:33:26
Ok send me some first and will send back double that amount , the higher you send the more you profit...sounds like a deal?
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:35:44
Hah rollercoaster ride will be an understatement!
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:39:50
Well post was intended to be a joke + TIL for some! Obviously it doesn't drive the point I see! I am going to watch Jack and Jill with my kid !
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:33:47
I want it! 
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:43:51
Hah happens! You are referring to my comments as well? Pls correct if I am wrong n will happy to update any wrong info !
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:21:29
Bitstamp.net .... Authentic! Except 6%fee for credit card..You will eventually earn that back!

I went in to buy at 3290$... gave it a few seconds thought...Price dropped to 3258$..Saved 30$ at least... Lucky...but it is still panic buying!
@_date: 2018-10-01 23:15:38
Dude there s a reason i called it a “conspiracy theory”. Now can you focus on the first sentence?
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:35:42
You are right partially! But so am I, pls put some thought into my post and comments. It is difficult to understand but once you realized how it works , you will make better decisions while trading!
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:02:01
Care to explain ?  His crytocurrency has 100 million units, he has sold 1 for 1 dollar... So the total market cap of 100 million units is still 1 dollar! 
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:09:02
True but I will be moving it past single handedly within few minutes all by myself! The market cap will be changed minimally by others in that time as people are selling at higher rates which I am offsetting by buying ! Don't you think?
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:48:32
Thanks! I am now confused...True am not a finance guy....The traditional IPO cannot be compared with bitcoin is what I thought because we create new coins every 10 mins which we don't do split in stocks every 10 mins...So in theory if everyone stops trading, and we mine empty blocks the market cap will just keep increasing where the bitcoin price remains the same! Another reason is we are talking about currency here and not an asset...May be we should rethink the whole or I am completely wrong...! Either way thanks for ur comment...I can't seem to update my post on mobile due to link, I'll update later!

You have to be 51% *UGLY*
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:25:22
Why would it not? Every coin that has been mined so far will still count immaterial whether it is lost or not!
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:38:09
Glad you have it all figured out!
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:22:52
Why not?
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:19:35
Good point! On a general note what he said was still right, after the market correction kicks in ...So basically if someone buys bitcoin for 10000$ , doesn't mean the exchange rate will stay at 10000$ forever it will scale down pretty quickly depending on the market cap...This is what is confusing so many people I think based on comments here!
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:10:57
Nobody is late in this game! Having said that don't try to convince anyone to invest in Bitcoin, just give them the info...No one blames you if they don't become rich but they will if they lose! 
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:36:58
My argument is that
1-segwit and lightning network in the future solves the scalability problem.
2-2MB size is just a simple workaround which will reduce the stress on the mempool and is a short term workaround and not a solution.
3-we will lose backward compatibility.
4-when we exhaust all options and think we can only scale by increase in block size, we could do so in future.
5-internet speed both download and upload needs to be really good for you to even compete with bigger block size, discourages some of the countries which doesn't have the infrastructure yet to participate.
6-lastly you can't keep keep creating new chain every now n then, it then becomes a kids game, people lose faith!
Many are just under assumption, oh something bigger is always a right solution-----look beyond, see through future ...have a clear idea and road map.
Santoshi did innovation, we need build on top of it to innovate further not say hey we are going to continue the legacy without Innovation! 
Be thankful to Satoshi Nakamoto for building a strong foundation and the others who pitched in! Let's innovate further!

Did u check the transaction status in bitstamp? It should say as finished. Usually it will ask for email confirmation for withdrawal and will remain in processing status till confirmed
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:44:13
Thank Uou Borg!

How about not being a pussy?
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:40:59
You are partially correct where you are assuming that 10 million would trigger a mad rush of buy order where the market depth increases for buy orders which in turn results in price rise which in turn brings in more buy volume resulting in increased market cap!
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:45:11
You never know what you'll do when you have billions as pocket change :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:37:20
Holy shit I don't want that to drop 1.5 k that will cause immense pain to so many, I would rather like to see it increase gradually and drop a lil from time to time ! 
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:33:16
I've been waiting from 2800$ ...Hoping for a dip but this is insane amount of increase! 
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:19:40
You are failing to understand that there are two parts to it, the exchange rate is based on the buyer offer and seller offer, but the exchange also kicks in market correction bringing down/up the price depending on the market cap! This is important to understand as someone could put up a buy offer for 10000$ in one exchange which will briefly move the price in that exchange only to 10000$ and goes down in a few minutes after market correction! It doesn't peg the price at 10000$ throughout all exchanges...How do you think all exchanges are able to trade in the same range and there are few whose prices are vastly different at times but eventually comes to the same price range...! Think!
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:50:13
That's what they said of Bitcoin, you never know until you try!
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:20:19
That is the unique position of bitcoin, it is both a currency and asset. You have the possibility of increasing your value in future unlike fiat currency which is guaranteed to decrease in value. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:50:21
You can use bitcoin in Expedia...Take a vacation will ya!
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:58:01
Wait till Aug 25-Sep1, cos that's when the hype around segwit will calm down....I am sure many of them will return to their prices but you won't get the equivalent BTC but 2700$ may be.   Hope is a good thing, may be the best thing!
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:15:59
There s a fucking widget...Thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:18:01
Sorry dude that's not how math works! Your market cap is now 1$....and your coin price after market correction will be 1/100 million even though some fool bought it for 1$. You are still clever though;)
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:55:55
What do u expect? Keep whining and be skeptic all along till it reaches 20K?
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:19:57
We'll take care of it on our Sunday morning! Do your best!
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:59:19
Let’s be early and build on the optimism! We dont get too much support if we keep being cautious!
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:24:07
30K is a reasonable target... 60K would be an insane amount!
@_date: 2018-06-17 16:35:46
The probability was not in favor in 2017 when china banned bitcoin , yet it surged towards the end. So that’s why any rational thoughts dont hold good...
@_date: 2018-06-17 21:39:43
Bitcoin’s price crossed $10000 largely due to pump n manipulation.. The same manipulation is being done today to keep the price down... they earn by shorting.. so either way the manipulators make money...But I would love them to manipulate it back to $20,000..!
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:35:48
You are trying to accumulate or shorting ? Heh
@_date: 2018-06-17 20:26:21

We all miss him!
@_date: 2018-11-12 07:06:27
Yeah he tricks everyone that he is dead, he kind of does this pretty frequently for past 10 years
@_date: 2018-11-12 05:27:53
Thanks! If you find him, let him know we are still at 20,000 feet and ask him to climb back up soon
@_date: 2018-11-12 07:58:54
He is not of tat type, he never settles down, he likes to fuck a lot of people, sometimes all at once like orgy!
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:23:39
Got it! Thanks!

Were u living in a cave ?
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:26:46
Lol it had a 20% increase! I get you bruthah! 
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:11:34
It certainly looks like a pump n will drop down in a couple of hours! Enjoy
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:04:46
He died eventually!
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:01:10
Will go or u want it to go? Seems like latter to me! 
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:19:08
Just letting you know, am against segwit2x..but what i've read so far indicates a blocksize increase to 2MB...that is what i stated. I am not sure who is misleading at this point?
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:31:23
Seems like u r waiting for a dip ?

It's 2MB!
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:44:02
They are not spoof! Exchanges move the price so that people do not take advantage of arbitration, it basically tries to sync up the price with other exchanges! If it didnt happen, you would have seen 10k in gdax by now!
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:21:40
Yea but it did it too!
