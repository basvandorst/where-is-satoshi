Well, I sometimes think that a certain neutrality is something which is essential for money. A form of money which would be used only by, say, republicans could never hope to be successful

If I think about it, that sounds like an option, but is a $50 laptop good enough for this? Is this fast enough for Ubuntu?

Well, I know that "complete security" does not exist, but maybe you can make a list which solutions ranks how security-wise.

So, all the people who user a Linux VM on a Windows PC are doing it wrong? And how can the VM shield the host in the other direction but  not from host to guest?

Sounds fine in theory, but why do Americans pay more for less healthcare than Germans, Swedes, Dutch or British people?
Why do European countries have a railway network and the US not?

Hm, of course I would like to have it easier. But does not the very concept of "compromised" mean that the whole system cannot be trusted any more? A Virus in Windows is certainly able to subvert the whole system, change drivers, install keyloggers, subvert update routines, and so on.

That's a brave hypothesis. And I do not see it supported by reality. The majority of people in Scandinavia, for example, chose a political system who raises more taxes and does far more for health, education and welfare. The difference is that the electorates have a much higher confidence that they can democratically control and monitor the public spending.

I am no political scientist. I know that Bitcoin attracts people with different points of view but please explain me what "left" anarchists have in common with "right" libertarians. I do not see much common ground there.
If Bitcoin would really be able to join these I'd say it has impressive integrative power.

I disagree with you. You basically say that people in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and The Netherlands don't know what they are voting for. Have you ever been there?
@_date: 2014-11-15 17:58:06
Libertarism is enormously political and has quite controversial views. So if Bitcoin appeals to libertarians, it should drive away that majority of people which do not have libertarian views. Why does that not happen?
And also, if a form of money is so much backing a political point of views, how can it be widely accepted by people from all the different views?

Yes, as long is it is collective concerns and does not infringe basic individual rights. That's democracy.
And  I do not mean "decide over a minority". Nobody has the right to decide over the personal matters of another individual. But things such as health insurance, welfare, public education and basic infrastructure are *collective matters*. And I think they cannot be completely mediated by markets, and the best way to decide about them is via democratic  vote.

So you think that Bitcoin is confined to people with anarcho-capitalist or libertarian outlook?

Many people say Debian has advantages but it should be not too complicated for the start. I looked at how to get an install medium and couldn't figure it out. But I've heard there is a Linux Mint Version with Debian packaging so this is perhaps easier to install.

Hm, I'd say that does not make Satoshi a libertarian. Has he expressed any political views apart from that?
@_date: 2014-11-15 20:12:49


The absurd thing is that the people *have* chosen how they want to organize things (using state organizations for things like welfare, education, health etc),  and you try to some degree to *impose* them your way (without state).

Germany, for example., has 35,000 km railways, or about 90 meter per square kilometer.
When comparing per-capita and per-square kilometer numbers, I would doubt that the US has anything near that.
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:50:55
The problem I have is that currently, big companies enforce that states withdraw from very basic services like education, transport, infrastructure like electricity and water, and health, and pass this to private companies who charge more for a poorer service. And this is called "freedom". It is arguably not entirely unproblematic if states provide such services, but if done right there is IMO more accountability than with monopolist private companies.
The whole issue boils down who controls and who negotiates those services, and there are quite a few areas where a privatized market is not the best option. Healthcare is an excellent example where US citizens get way less than Europeans for a much steeper price. I don't know any Europeans who would like to swap with them.

That's one aspect of this - libertarism is obviously an aspect of the US political system. People elsewhere are not much interested in it.

Isn't that a bit of a small toy distro which would be less secure? How often does this get quick security updates if there's a serious  exploit?
@_date: 2014-11-15 17:32:35
This is an interesting list. I would like to ask how one would rate the security of each solution? I like to think as "do I think this is safe enough to hold xxx .. Dollars". For example, I would not carry more than 150 dollars in my wallet.
Of course, this depends on the income and lifestyle of people. So, to make it a bit more objective, let's pretend you earn an average monthly income of 2000 dollars. How much money would you be comfortable to hold with each solution? How much, for example, would you trust on a Windows PC?

This is a very good point. However, I do not see it reflected by the Bitcoin foundation or by this reddit community.
@_date: 2014-11-15 12:11:09
This was to be expected. I am already wondering whether all these " buy drugs anonymously on the Internet" sites are operated by the feds. The narrative that bitcoin is anonymous is a huge trap for these people.
If the story is true, this is catastrophic for every child affected and also potentially catastrophic for Bitcoin. We are not speaking about victimless crime. Whoever operates this, the community should get rid of them as soon as possible.
