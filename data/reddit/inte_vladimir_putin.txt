Desktop is dying, once laptops get the same amount of GPU/CPU performance there's no longer a reason to buy a desktop instead of a laptop. Home servers are rare and cloud servers are centralized. Increasing the block size won't be enough to scale, it's a temporary solution that could work a few more years but it won't work in the long term.

Shitcoin? that's fiat you got there, created out of thin air. That truck is literally hauling thin air.

Probably but why would they if you don't have the keys on you? They can still break up a safety box after they kill you but they can't get your private keys if you're dead.

Libre office took the code from open office and made something better under a new name, if you truly think your fork is better than the original why are you using the same name then?

Well you still gotta pay some armed guys in an armed van to transport your cash to the bank regularly. And let's not forget that during all the time you have the cash laying around there's always a chance some some guys with funny hats and guns tries to take the cash from you. Keeping your cash safe isn't cheap.

For a legit cloud mining company it's generally a risk free operation. You know the fees for electricity, bandwidth, hardware and charge your customers upfront in order to pay for expanding your operation. Trouble is there's no way to know if the company is actually mining or if it's just a ponzi scheme which is more profitable. Over the years I've learned that the best profit is made from hodling.

As a merchant I'll rather do that then waiting for the full confirmation. A customer paying with VISA or MasterCard are more likely to cause a chargeback by not having money in their bank account or by filing a complaint to the bank about unauthorized usage of their card. 
With today's fees a double spending attack would probably cost more than just paying for the burger.

All charity organizations should accept crypto, when it comes to food packages every cent counts and fiats inflation has probably killed a lot of people by now. I wonder how many lives that has been saved thanks to the increasing value of Bitcoin.

Good time to invest in Bitcoin then, when Bcash dump comes Bitcoin will raise again.

Many of the easy to use wallets like Exodus doesn't support segwit yet.

It may be the original solution but it was also written in a time when people used desktop PC's in where you can easily fit multiple xTB sized 3.5" drives in order to keep the decentralization. Today however more people are using laptops, mobile devices with centralized storage solutions as you can't fit enough storage on mobile devices.
You're gonna end up with a centralized coin really fast if you keep increasing the block size without considering the total size of the chain.

Get yourself a ice cream truck and kidnap some children in a rich neighborhood then ask the parents for a ransom.

Still safer than normal banks and plastic cards. One solution could also be to solve the scaling problem similar to how the banks did with savings accounts and spending accounts by storing most of the assets in real cryptocurrencies (cold wallets) then having a small amount in XRP or similar low cost "coins" (hot wallet) for all the micro transactions.
Right now BTC can't handle a large amount of micro transactions per day by every user, but if there where only a few transactions per month and user it could work. At least as a temporary solution.

Problem is that even tho Bcash is an alt-coin with a shitty scaling solution their main achievement is to fool innocent investors by stealing the name Bitcoin. I have nothing against them or their coin but they shouldn't steal the name. 
It's confusing for the noobs and even some professionals, people accidentally send to the wrong address and loose their coins without any possibility to recover. It's terrible for Bitcoins reputation.

Exodus does the same with Ethereum and all ER20 tokens, same address for all of them and same private keys if I understand it right. It sure is a smart solution but I still think Bcash should change their name to avoid confusion, if people keep getting confused and send to the wrong address someone's gonna get sued over lost funds very soon. 
I'm afraid that's "someone" may be some innocent merchant accused for not informing their customers good enough about how Bcash and other forks tries to steal Bitcoins name while providing invalid addresses that makes Bitcoin disappear.

Well Bcash supporters also think it's a good solution to just keep increasing the block size, it may work in the short term but long term you'll eventually get huge blocks and a chain too big for regular desktop PC's which means you'll end up with the block chain only available on centralized cloud storage data centers.
Unlike mining you're not getting paid to host a copy of the block chain but it's very important that as many as possible do host a full copy of the block chain which means it's in everyone's best interest to keep it's size reasonable.

Credit/debit cards aren't very common in such places so for merchants who only use cash today Bitcoin would be easier and cheaper to implement than a card processing system. Bitcoin would also reduce the risk of getting robbed, provide secure storage and solve many other issues with cash that merchants has to deal with today.
Light wallets are also an option unless the internet is strictly censored and only allows access to major banks.
