Slow and steady wins this race, why fret about dailies? Gonna keep my dollar-cost averaging strategy going.

I do hear what you're saying, but I think bitcoin "maximalism" is less about pumping up prices and more about consolidating cryptocurrency into a less diluted commodity to increase the adoption rate. While one of my favorite aspects of crypto is the decentralization and democratization of currency processes, I think there's something to be said about developers pooling all of these great tech ideas into more united or federated projects rather than competing with one another.

Keep drilling, you're not going to hit $8,500 buddy.

would be cool I guess but there's not a lot of credibility there.

@_date: 2019-08-28 19:27:17

payday hitting. don't think that $8500 short is gonna cover.
@_date: 2019-08-16 08:08:23
Stay under 10K for just a little longer my paycheck clears shortly.

Hey there!
I'm by no means an expert on financial institutions in the global south, but it's my understanding that prepaid debit cards are by no means unobtainable, it's more about an "FDIC"-like backed banking network that makes storing money in banks in potentially political unstable countries risky, not to mention liquidity levels for the average banking consumer. Because everything is very cash-based, retail processing infrastructure and POS systems are likely pretty rare, but that doesn't mean that the internet isn't widely used and online purchases aren't widespread.

Setting up a lightning node today on my home server. Are there any other infrastructural things I could do to improve networks? Other nodes to run?

I've been watching this one 
It's been very informative.

Got paid in bitcoin six or seven months ago, and used about 3/4 of it for things I needed at the time, while keeping the last 1/4 as a speculative hobby investment, which I've been committed to just holding and seeing what happens to it. The last few months have been a lot of fun, and this correction doesn't scare me at all, but does anyone have any reading that justifies their long-term belief in this technology as a currency replacement or as something that could be in the six-figure price-range down the line? I think I understand the basics pretty well, I'm just very curious as to why some have come to such optimistic conclusions. As somebody who sees quite a bit of utilization in it and sees a widespread adoption rate in a variety of consumer goods and services I use, I'm wondering if I should increase my holdings.

Reaching my holding goals six months early on this dip.

Of course, check your PMs!

Sitting over $1,000 of their strike price on the day the contract expired after the dump was pretty satisfying. It was a dip you KNEW you could buy because they just couldn't break the bottom.

It's good to spread a few accounts on different books. Tons of places do bitcoin matches as bonuses to your deposits, but sometimes the withdrawal stipulations of that can be kind of steep. In my experience, some people hate Bovada, some people love them, they've paid out pretty large amounts with no difficulty to me before and generally their lines are pretty good/competitive with other books. BetonlineAG is pretty good, 5dimes isn't bad (but their founder did just turn up dead over a bitcoin ransom...).
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:21:16
just burped and that dip I bought all last week still tastes real good.

was trying to match my stack I got from cashing out my football betting account at the end of last season, which I've seen a huge return on. I've been DCAing for the last eight or nine months and now I've got twice that. My goal is to hold a whole coin before the halving, and I'd say that's doable with what I've been doing, and provided I can replicate my success this football season, hahaha.
