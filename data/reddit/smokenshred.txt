i started at the time with $11.56 usd and sent it to coinbase, i ended up with 3.35 in my coinbase with the miner fee set to "normal" i am just glad that it was a small amount but i really want my coin back but i dont think that will ever happen. hence the reason why i will never use mycelium wallet ever again unless they give me back my coin and a formal apology for ripping me off with a "bug"

i had $11.56 in my account and transferred it to coinbase and the fee was sent to normal, i ended up paying a fee of $8.21 and only recieved 3.35

unfortunately i have few options, they have the lowest fees that i have found to be able to buy with a credit card.

i see why they are so crummy. screw that, i would rather send money through snail mail, the price difference and buy/sell fees are like being charged 3 times for the same money

i accumulated 0.00514703 over a long period of time through faucets on mycelium which is what i recieved after it was confirmed and it has been there a long time, i bought 0.00418445 from someone in one payment and it was confirmed on 2/28, every single transaction that went into my mycelium wallet was already confirmed. all i did was try to transfer all of it to coinbase and i just about crapped myself when i saw the miner fees. i dont make much money to begin with and i know it does not seem like a large loss but that took me a long time to get.
i attempted to transfer my maximum amount and now i dont want to ever use mycelium wallet again. idk what i would have done if i tried to put $100 usd on there to transfer to an exchange because i wanted to make a purchase but this has me worried. all i wanna do is make a purchase... mycelium is drained now (0.00) i have nothing left...
this transfer was a test and it failed miserably.

thank you, i dont really like mycelium anyways, i have a different wallet now. if only my bank would stop declining my card payment to coinbase...

so since the inputs have been spent then the fees are going to be back to normal?
