Reminds me of the first 10 minutes exercise we had to do on the first day of my graphic design class.
@_date: 2019-03-05 04:03:47
Glad we shared

That belongs on r/killedthecameraman

Must be fun at parties
@_date: 2018-10-29 00:43:44
A little amount each day here. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 22:45:43
Agree, just hope secretly some talented logo designer would participate and maybe be inspired by these ideas.

Banks Will likely adapt if they move fast enough, they will certainly at least try.

Reminds me of All these Internet cafés on the 90s. That didn't age well.

A company with money bought an AD? Game changer for sure.

Can't wait for the moment it becomes as interesting as a picture of an regular ATM

Big, if big.

I'm ready to read hyped artricles about the halving for the next 12 months.

Great thanks, i'll begin with bitcoin core and see from there. Now i need to know what would be the best online newbieproof ressource to install it on a Windows 7 computer (can't upgrade to 10) on an external drive.
@_date: 2019-06-03 00:24:22
I think you meant every day
@_date: 2019-06-03 01:03:08
BTC will be the universally agreed metric but it will likely be a long way to go. (Maybe wishful thinking but it sounds plausible to me).
@_date: 2019-06-01 01:43:09
Read 5$, was super eager to buy it...
@_date: 2019-04-29 23:09:48
Better than no toilets at all like here in Canada.
@_date: 2019-12-02 04:15:38
Best analogy i've seen so far, nailed it.

Yes every restaurant too, we're obviously talking about outside bathrooms.

That's a tremendous opportunity for Bitcoin to be associated to the far right in people's mind (on of my fears i guess)
@_date: 2019-01-31 03:04:47
That's probably a noob question but is there a monetary incentive to set up a node or you do it only to help the network, learn about setting up a node and be part of history?

At this point it's really more than a rumour.  
"At the time, SamMobile executive editor Adnan Farooqui confirmed that the company is developing a cold storage crypto wallet and intends to integrate it in the Galaxy S10."

We all know you'll install it back at 10K
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:13:38
Reminds me of the Reddit posts around january 2018 when everyone was calling 14K BTC a steal.
@_date: 2019-05-26 13:53:52
Thanks man, good idea to use it for discovery. I began tipping influencers on Twitter with the tippin.me plugin because they don't have the plugin or don't know about it it automatically sends a message saying that I wanted to tip them but couldn't  and it adds a link to let me know how to install the plugin and what it is.
There you go:

Nope, just a nice round number the real resistance is around 6400ish.
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:25:13
Thanks man, appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-05-25 00:56:07
Et voilà!
