It depends on how you look at Bitcoin. In my opinion there are three facets to it. 1) foreign exchange trading, 2) mining, and 3) business/consumer transactions.I support the business/consumer side of Bitcoin the most because without people spending BTC it's not really a currency, now is it?So, going back to your comment about it not being for the common man- I strongly disagree. Anybody can get their hands on BTC. Hell, if I was a chicken farmer in a 3rd world country, I could sell eggs for BTC.I think that Bitcoin can revolutionize the world's economy, but we need to keep the vision of it being a currency, and not a stock. That is my goal here. Plan B is the answer to what all 99% Occupy Movement people were searching for: a decentralized monetary system.

Right now, users just login and create listings manually. Honestly, I am still considering whether or not syncing with the Coinmap database is a good idea. People have been complaining that a lot of merchants listed on that site do not accept Bitcoin anymore. At least on my site, I am going to make it so that anybody can edit listings... Like a wiki. That would ensure accurate listings as long as users contribute.

But why would demand fall if more merchants are accepting it as payment? I feel like it would get more Bitcoin in circulation. Am I way off? Sorry, but I don't know economics at all.I think the people that kill Bitcoin are the day traders and hoarders (HODLers). They are not spending Bitcoin like a currency, they are waiting to make a buck or two based on the price. Once they sell, they wait for another price drop to buy in again.

I agree with this method in other scenarios; raising kids, teaching students, training dogs, etc. But not in this case. For every fly-by-night startup that swoops into the Bitcoin community to take fools' money, a field day for bad press is born. I can't think of how many times I've asked people about their thoughts on Bitcoin and their opinion is negative due to the bad press.So instead of letting people learn the hard way, why don't we just work together as a community and protect Bitcoin's reputation?

You're right, Coinmap has links created by a community. However, I think my idea behind it being "community driven" is that Kerncy houses discussions in comments and allows merchants to offer specials to their customers. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 14:55:41
I think the missing link in Bitcoin adoption is not the "killer app" that I hear everyone waiting for, I think it is independence from fiat. Most of today's startups focus on converting fiat to Bitcoin or accepting Bitcoin as payment and converting to fiat: the ATM's, the debit cards, the POS terminals, etc. are all missing the point. We don't want to deal with fiat. We want to buy and sell using Bitcoin.None of these companies are "selling" Bitcoin as a revolutionary technology; they are creating quick and easy methods for merchants to say "Bitcoin accepted here" but never truly adopting it.I think we will see major adoption when a large retailer accepts it as payment. Let's not wait for the killer app, let's go out and have conversations with people.On a sidenote, I like what [Bitcoin Bigfoot]( is doing in the sense that they are pushing quality marketing materials to the masses for free.

I would recommend Coinbase if you're in the US. They are insured for theft.
The way I see it is you have two choices, just like any currency. Choose a bank that you trust or keep it at home. Which do you feel more comfortable with? If you choose to store your money at home, I'm sure you would take the necessary precautions to protect it.
Just be smart and never get too comfortable with either situation.

I hope I'm not too late to join the party. Please upvote this if you like what I'm doing.I have been working on a site that lists businesses that accept ALL CRYPTOCURRENCIES, not just Bitcoin. I am building this site for scalability for new altcoins as they gain popularity while keeping in mind that currencies may disappear as well. Currently we showcase brick and mortar businesses that accept Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Peercoin.We are currently only accepting brick and mortar businesses in an effort to keep the website location-based, however this may change in the near future. I originally intended for it to be a yelp-like website, however everybody that I've spoken with says I shouldn't compete with Yelp reviews because it is annoying to have to check two sources for reviews (e.g., Eat24); especially since yelp is the only trusted source for business ratings these days. I do however allow businesses to link to their yelp page.Please check out my site, it is still heavily on the works, but fully functional. I am going to be hosting a contest at some point within the next couple of weeks. I will be giving away Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin to the users who add the most business listings to the directory.Here's an example of a full business profile: Please join the [Kerncy.com]( community and help us become the most complete cryptocurrency directory on the web!

What if we pool money together and make a bid to buy the domain name? Let's just say we were successful. Who would own the domain then? Would we trust the Bitcoin Foundation to own the domain?
I don't think Blockchain.info is going to change their ways. They seem to be really flexing some financial muscle by "leasing" Bitcoin.com and using it as a huge banner ad.
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:26:22

Just a general graphic design suggestion... When using colors to fill in objects to show percentages, the color showing the percentage should always be brighter or more visually grabbing than the unfilled color. In your case, the colors should be reversed. For example, the 38% portion should be green, not black. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:21:59
I wasn't trying to hide the fact that I'm the founder of Kerncy and I'm not sure how it was dishonest for me to not mention it.Either way, there are a number of reasons Coinmap will never fill the void that I am trying to fill. I'll keep it brief.1) Coinmap seems to be brick and mortar only. A lot of vendors accepting Bitcoin do not have a storefront. I don't think this can change since OSM is based on location.2) Coinmap only shows the name of business and contact info. They do not offer a description field for the merchant. Kerncy also allows you to offer specials to cryptocurrency customers.3) Kerncy has commenting which opens up the possibility of discussions about merchants.Overall OSM is a great platform for displaying locations, but I am aiming to do much more than that. It might be throwing you off that I show a large map on the homepage because it seems like you think I'm trying to create just another map, which is not the case.

Yes, I believe Coinmap and Kerncy can coexist because I think our goals are very different. Coinmap focuses on location-based (brick and mortar) businesses, while Kerncy lists online retailers as well. Kerncy is more consumer-oriented because it allows businesses to showcase specials for Bitcoin customers. I don't think Coinmap could ever accomplish these features, mainly because the businesses don't have individual profiles. I've also recently expanded Kerncy to include [reviews on exchanges and hosted wallets]( so users can share their experiences with the community.

I used to think that as well. Now I feel the lack of leadership has caused the Bitcoin community to falter. By the way, if you don't think anyone is making decisions for the future of Bitcoin you are terribly mistaken. Why do you think Bitcoin Cash exists?
I remember when r/Bitcoin was full of posts about shops and vendors posting about how excited they were to accept Bitcoin. Prior were getting friends and relatives in board. The community was driving it as a currency.
Today, the community is divided. BTC or BCC? SegWit or no?

Can we also recommend to spend Bitcoin as well? Even if you are holding, you can always buy Bitcoin and spend it at market rate so there is really no loss in your holdings. 
Or am I way off base for thinking that stimulating the Bitcoin economy is as important as investing?

What about compared to when it was $800? What was that, two years ago?
My point is, its all relative. For every buyer that thinks its a good time to buy, there is a seller that thinks it is a good time to sell.

I would simplify it a bit more. For example, when explaining Bitcoin, you don't need to say when it was invented. 
Bitcoin is a global currency that is purely digital. Spend it or send money over the internet practically for free.

There are other ways to support the bitcoin economy rather than just buying bitcoin. For example you can spend bitcoin, support bitcoin orgs that raise awareness, invest in technologies that help bitcoin evolve, get involved with adoption, and the list goes on. 
You must remember that supporting the bitcoin economy doesn't necessarily mean getting the price to go up, it should mainly be to promote mass adoption.

I actually haven't used any colorful buttons except for the two at the top right. By the way, the example you linked to has colored icons as well.
FYI, this mockup is based on the [Mac version of Bitcoin-QT]( The existing app is really not much different than my mockup, aside from a few graphical changes. I realize that it may take some extra work to port the design over to Windows 95.
**Edit**: [Here's a screenshot of the current Mac Bitcoin-QT which also shows colored rows for the transaction screen. How does this look on your monochrome Windows?](

@_date: 2013-07-17 13:45:13
Actually, strip down the graphical changes. Lets take a step back and look at the functionality changes I'm proposing. 
1) There are recently used addresses on the overview. It fills in the huge blank space which is currently useless. This saves at least two clicks to get to a QR code to receive money. Currently, you have to click receive money, select the address, then click the QR code button at the bottom of the screen (bad place for it BTW). That's a lot of work when we could have all of that as a right-click on the home screen!
2) I'm showing 10 recent transactions in a table, which is similar to the main Transactions screen. The current layout is extremely hard to read in my opinion. Table rows is the at to go. I'm not sure why we need huge icons and unaligned text. We could even add sorting and filtering to the recent transactions which would make it even more powerful. 
3) The action items (send and receive) are pulled away from the view items for better visibility. 
Overall, the changes I'm proposing are not a major overhaul. Just improvements. Even if we don't go with the graphical changes, I just want the software to be more usable. Today, I feel like the overview screen is a waste of space. I find myself clicking away from it for for day-to-day tasks; tasks that can be displayed right when the software launches. 
I have many other ideas for the other screens which I will continue to share as I have time for mockups.

I hate to be a stickler for money you're essentially throwing at me, but I think you need a space between the amount and the mBTC (i.e., 10 mBTC instead of 10mBTC).

Yes, I agree that web clients are more popular. I use Coinbase as well, however I was shocked to see that when I received BTC from another Coinbase user, their email address was revealed to me!
More importantly, with all of the downtime and closing down of these companies, why not offer a more user-friendly local solution?

I was in Naic, Cavite most of the time. I hung out at the beach a lot, Tagaytay to gamble and did a lot of drinking at bars! Made a ton of friends. 
My mom opened up a tindahan in the palengke, so I helped her out with that some days. It was kinda tough since I don't speak Tagalog well, but I still loved it. 
I was also in Manila often. It was just a 45 minute drive. Resorts World in Manila is beautiful! Went to the clubs there once in a while. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 17:05:52
Thanks for the offer, but it looks like I have some things to think about such as proposing this to another app, or learning QT to see what is feasible across other OS's with different color schemes.

I'm assuming that he wants USD for products to AT LEAST break even when purchasing products at wholesale. Think about it; he pays for that stuff with USD. With the volatile value of Bitcoin, he could easily lose hundreds of dollars a month. 
I'm assuming the fee for his time to cut and style your hair can fluctuate, since he's not paying any money out of pocket for that.

It would only be acceptable once the value of BTC settles a bit (pun intended). 
Imagine getting paid in Bitcoins only to find out the next morning that the value has dropped $10 overnight. Let's say I get paid $2,000 every pay period. That would be 20 BTC if we rounded to $100 per BTC. If BTC dropped to $90 overnight, you would have lost $200.
Although the chance for it to go up in value overnight would be nice.

I'm a bit paranoid about my bank account connected to Coinbase. Isn't it true that a hacked Coinbase account means the hacker would have access to your bank account to buy Bitcoins? Am I the only one that is nervous about this?
I don't mind a linked account on Paypal, because transactions are reversible.

Tip someone else in another subreddit to spread the word about Bitcoin. Hell, tip two people .001 BTC each!
@_date: 2013-07-22 03:35:27
Agreed. I was using Coinbase for a while, but then realized the consequences of a hacked account. Since my bank account was connected directly to my Coinbase account, a hacker could easily buy Bitcoin with funds from my checking account, then proceed to send all of my BTC to their wallet. With no possible way to reverse the transaction, Coinbase will be useless in a dispute.
Also on that note, please be careful with your saved passwords in your browsers. Most online banking sites do not allow you to store your username/password, but Coinbase does. Big risk there. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 02:37:14

I disagree with your opinion on the word propaganda. It can be positive or negative, true or false, and does not necessarily have to be political. The essence of the word is to promote a movement. For example, an anti-smoking campaign would use positive propaganda.
