They grab it from the temple in japan which originally says "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil." Which is said originated from Confusius teaching from China, which is said probably originated from ancient Buddhism/Hinduism. With a little tweaking of course.
That being said, yeah i guess you can print it on a tshirt or mug or anywhere. Love to see it  everywhere.

Congrats on your 2nd cake! With you all the best. 
Good things to hear you guys keep monitoring so that your customers could be avoided from scammers. Very good thing to hear in this full of scam world. 
About your name, I honestly haven't heard of. Maybe to the lack of ads or something. Hopefully you guys can make more ads and make yourself better heard. Also with good and ineteresting products. For similar product I think localbitcoin is better known so far. 
Again, wish you the best on your 2nd cake! And more cakes to come :).
Edit: I don't know why my post keep disappearing. This is like the 3rd time I post same thing :(

Congrats on your 2nd year. Wish you all the best. Good thing to hear from you is that you protect your customer from being scammed. That's very nice to hear in this full of scam world.       
About your name, I honestly haven't heard of. Heard of localbitcoin more. Hopefully you guys will come out a lot better with more ads, or interesting products, so more will be known from you.
All the best for your 2nd cake! :)

 &gt; 31. Services of organizers and operators of lotteries,
gambling terminals, gambling, betting, betting shops,
betting terminals, casinos, and any games of chance.
No games.
Edit: that should point 31. Not 1. In the term and conditions. I type 31 but somehow it only shows 1.

From 0 to 5%, now 1%. Guys, make up your mind quick. You're making me worrying of when you re going to up it again. Roller coaster fee is bad for business, especially crypto currency price is by itself a roller coaster ride.
