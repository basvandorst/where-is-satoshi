@_date: 2019-07-27 21:44:55
Never buy. Rent instead.
@_date: 2018-09-17 10:09:23
Help me understand: what is the buyer doing with the information?

@_date: 2018-09-23 20:10:10
So when is the end?
@_date: 2018-09-27 21:29:36
@_date: 2018-09-20 22:26:16
But I thought funds are saifu
@_date: 2018-09-07 09:05:35
You got owned dude. BTC didn't
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:20:04
Is it now the time to go into altcoins?
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:41:46
... but when that time comes i will not waste it on a car, but invest it in something else.
@_date: 2018-08-30 14:03:12
What? Binance is 8 months old? I somehow traveled in the future. I've seen things.
@_date: 2018-08-25 20:03:51
Ok u win dude

"Already received $1000, sorry it's $987, sorry it's $960, sorry it's actually $981. I received 0,11 BTC!!"
@_date: 2018-08-25 11:25:20
I got my Btc really easy. I bought 3, traded a bit now i also have 1 btc just like you. Easy peasy.
@_date: 2018-08-30 14:47:12
I also understood it like that. Also that binance is only 8 months old
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:25:58
Is now a good time to exchange btc with alts?
@_date: 2018-10-07 19:59:03
yeah. I mean why wouldn't they? 
@_date: 2018-10-13 09:24:22
Hmm that's brilliant
@_date: 2018-10-03 23:02:06
So you had sex at disney, your gf got pregnant and now the child is using reddit?
@_date: 2018-10-18 18:52:29
Ukraine and moldova but no Romania. Fck these guys
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:56:30
Not even 30k BTC. Pathetic.
@_date: 2018-10-18 13:31:24
Nice, but i never saw green candles in crypto
@_date: 2018-10-14 20:54:13

@_date: 2018-10-27 17:51:10
this is rather bad news than good
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:10:19
no shit
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:40:05
When lambo?
@_date: 2018-10-18 13:46:18
Fck everybody who makes these lists. There are some countries I have never heard of and my country is never listed.
@_date: 2018-10-12 13:51:28
you're absolutely killing it
@_date: 2019-11-06 23:06:41
My dream is to open my own shill bar, where everybody shills his shitcoins to others.
@_date: 2018-10-12 18:44:43
Me two, was expecting to get rich by doing nothing.
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:19:17
I always think about bitcoin when somebody says to me 'it can't get any worse'.
@_date: 2019-10-28 18:12:06
Is the $87 a typo? Where is the profile page of this guy?
@_date: 2019-10-22 19:35:19
I have a rly simple strategy
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:19:08
I hope i become a billionaire too, one day.
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:59:40
Thanks. I am holding since 2017
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:34:40
I missed WWIII by checking crypto prices non stop.
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:19:20
never lucky
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:30:28
looks like a mortal kombat 3 background
@_date: 2019-10-22 19:34:31
You forgot an ‘if’
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:56:08
He is right. Whales always use memes to make profitable trading decisions.
@_date: 2019-02-04 19:12:34
How do these phishing tricks work? How do they know you use electrum?
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:34:18
No he is right. I made some calculations and also called my meth teacher. 10k is 10k and 100k is 100k.
Hint: typo was on purpose.

Browsing the lamo catalogue as we speak
@_date: 2019-12-19 21:34:39
what profit can you do nowadays with mining? Is the BtC halving good or bad for the mining business?
@_date: 2019-12-13 08:04:58
They have been doing this for years. I withdrew everything 2 years ago.
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:50:28

all of us. we all have fords and we all hodl
@_date: 2018-11-10 10:17:36
We need people to buy bitcoin directly and not ETFs
@_date: 2018-11-05 16:55:38
What is a santiment?
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:23:08
Bottom is 2,5k.
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:21:59
If you bought in 2018, you've bought the dip.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:03:02
Actually it's buy low, sell lower now
@_date: 2018-11-05 13:34:00


I agree. BTC definitely goes to 2m+ at least.
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:59:59
Once it hits \~2500, a new bullrun will begin.
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:09:30
The guy on the shirt is him at 20k btc. Look how skinny he got
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:49:44
Oh i like this comment
@_date: 2019-01-23 21:12:15
this is actually good news. before we had to pay tax for every transaction. now it's only on profits. 10% is acceptable
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:26:27
I am only 26 and I feel great.
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:48:36

He has crypto. Get ‘em bois
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:08:06
I hate it so much when they don't tell you the reason. "We locked your account for unknown reasons". Fuck you bitch, it's my account, my money - tell me the reason!!!
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:39:32
my strat is buy low, sell lower.
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:03:51
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:48:59
... and then I got home and thought that I should have shilled my shitcoins to this person.
@_date: 2018-12-18 10:26:22
I just call it Bitcorn
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:28:03
I get this too. Everybody who didn’t invest in btc is sending me this shit.
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:16:45
There is no way it drops below 1k
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:10:18
You cant withdraw that bitcoin afaik.
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:05:49
the bottom is when there is a huge drop and an instant increase. something like -15% and +20% in one day.
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:51:51
Yes. Invest you life savings now
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:23:45
My favorite strategy is not to sell.
@_date: 2018-12-21 23:48:07
can u tell us when will BTC be above 15k again?
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:37:32


I really doubt you can retire with $1 million.

Rich fucks with iphones. I still have my nokia 3310
@_date: 2018-12-18 10:24:55
30k per year or per transaction?
@_date: 2019-05-24 09:33:57
I agree. Can't believe people recommend it so often.
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:33:22
bcash is bitcoin.com and not bitcoin.org
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:59:11
Vegeta, I am waiting for you.
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:16:08
Yeah what a fcking statement
