How did your bitcoins get stolen? How should I prevent this?

This is great news. Just today I was thinking that if a bitcoin were 3.32 dollars instead of 332 and having 100 times the number of bitcoins, it would be a lot more "accessible" to a lot of people. This is quite like this. Let's see if it has an effect.

Is this really a "pro-bitcoin subreddit"? I see it more as a "bitcoin centered subreddit".

Well let's hope so. I'm one of the new users you are talking about. I've been following bitcoin for a little over a year now. I'm planning on buying about 5k worth of BTC. Plus making a few transactions (as u/yellomango said, buying the BTC before the transaction)

Thanks for the tip jmaller! I'll have to look into tipping and how it works, it's totally new to me. 
Regarding the investment, I know it's pretty risky but I kinda always been low risk when taking decisions in my life, so a little informed risk seems exciting. I'd probably not invest more than 15% of my savings in bitcoin right now. Next step is convincing my dad to buy some (although he didn't buy Tesla stock at $95 because his stock buddies said it was already overvalued, so it might be harder to convince him to buy BTC)

This sounds pretty reasonable.

Yeah, localbitcoins.com

I'll just have to ask because I honestly don't know:
How would they manipulate it to go down?

Yesterday people were wondering if the website was a scam. It's good to know it is not.
@_date: 2014-12-16 21:43:39
That's true, still I'd like to know what are other people's expectations. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 23:36:40
Some people are optimists and say the price will go back up. 
Some people are pesimists and swear the market might crash and bitcoin will fail as a currency. 
Some of us are intrigued with the new technology and going for the full ride.
@_date: 2014-12-16 21:49:37
Although a market crash could also sound reasonable, let's hope for the best. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 23:33:42
What do you need to know?

Great, I think microtransactions are a good bet to making BTC more widespread as well as encouraging circulation, not only having BTC in your wallet.

I'd love for it to be 20k, it seems kind of in the high side. Though 1k was probably laughed at when the price was lower than 5 bucks.
