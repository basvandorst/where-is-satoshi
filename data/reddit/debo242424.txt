Let me just say that if large bitcoin stake holders wanted too they could pump the price very easily. The question you have to ask is ... Why haven't bitcoins large stake holders  pumped the price? When you realize the answer to this question you begin to understand why price is going down. Like I've said before when bitcoin price goes up most won't have time to get in. Microsoft has done their research. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 12:44:18
Go to r/bitcoinmarkets and read the post by Charlie Shrem. You will then understand what is happening. The market price is under valued and OTC blocks are going for a premium. The price on exchanges isn't a true representation of BTCs worth. 
If you think about it there isn't any incentive to short bitcoin right now. There aren't enough sellers willing to dump coins much less than 300.00. The shorting has been exhausted.... there is a supply issue. What happens when supply is less than demand? How long this takes is unclear 1 week or 3 months... We don't know. The whales are getting bored and a launch is near I'm betting up to 500-550. But we could see low 300's before this happens. If price breaks 410 it'll go on a run. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 02:09:13
Because I have a plan that I'm sticking to and that's holding for 2 years. Yeah could I save a little by selling now and buying further down but I will buy there all the while cost averaging down. Yeah I bought a few at 650 but if you but a few at 250 it averages to 450 and my overall average waaaay less than that. 
Plus I believe in this and I'm putting my money with the Wall St. banks buying millions OTC. You think they don't know what they are doing? Why are they buying and not selling? Ask yourself that. You negatives will never get it.

I'm glad everyone is aware of this market manipulation now. It's very obvious. What's funny is once it bottoms out there will be no more money to be made on 10-25% fluctuations. That's when ManBearWhalePig starts the manipulation in the opposite direction.

I like robocoin because of it's ability to adapt to future regulations. I have not considered any other brands as of yet mainly for lack of feedback and information concerning laws.
As far as my expectations for breaking even I am not sure I have any.  I mean the timeframe is not  important but if you are incinuating that profiting from  BITCOIN ATMS isn't possible and that breaking even can be all that's expected then maybe this isn't for me.  I am not expecting to get widly rich but also would expect to make a profit at some reasonable point.

Guys don't look at what your BTC is worth in fiat. Just focus on how many BTC you have. Smart people are getting in now. Nobody is losing millions on this unless they get out now. There's not much more to lose... Its even a risk to short now. It will be pumped back up by these same people.

Remittances will speed this up considerably. But yes we need to grow organically and bitcoin is doing just that as we speak. With Circle and hedging business growth is inevitable. 
It took me 1 month of research before buying my first coin. Give Circle and the expanded user base of Coinbase time to bloom. Price will grow steady and slowly. Once this trend begins miners begin to hodl and so do the corps. It will snowball...but not before a bear trap. Watch the bear trap it's going to be scary.

I understand you don't want access but the safest way would be store in multiple offline wallets of varying amounts and store all your private keys on something physical like an encrypted USB drive. Store USB drives in a safety deposit box or at a person you trust house. Do that twice in case something happens to first location... Fire, death...etc.  
@_date: 2014-10-04 01:07:50
If you think bitcoin isn't going to go back up even if it's just by manipulation alone your definitely not in this "guys w brains" group you speak of.  Just watch. Once the momentum starts in the other direction it won't stop easily. 
Also even if your right about another coin taking the number one spot from bitcoin I guarentee you won't be invested in it.  
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:24:46
You are 100% right. I just can't believe people can't see this. The bubble was for VC money. This crash is for a low entry point and to shake most coins from greedy dorks who don't belong in this space anyway. These dorks are the same guys crying because the 5 bitcoin they bought is only worth 2000 usd instead of 3500 usd they bought in at. Once bitcoin goes down to 200 is less most will sell or lose interest that's when big money comes in and the price begins it's ascension.

@_date: 2014-10-06 02:22:50
Better less public ways to sell. Not to mention he could have manipulated price a lot higher then sold off market. When you have 10 million USD you know people. 
I don't buy he is a legit seller.  Maybe just a scared holder. When he slapped that 30k wall down at 300 earlier everyone was in a huge panic. It looked more like a line of defense to me. Now he's trying to lure the price the other way and maybe sell some for 300 plus. I doubt anyone will buy all thoes coins anytime soon. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:35:46
Price matters you guys but never forget you still hold your bitcoin. This is just shaking things up.... Hodl to zero and still hold. Look at the past and learn from that. It's all just psychological. Look at it like the big banks/investors robbing you.  They want that 100 dollar entry point and it's looking like they will get it. Ride with THEM not the panic. Somebody is buying these coins....

They need to easily be able to trade their currency for bitcoin and vice versa. If I lived there I'd open a small bitcoin store for making these transactions easy for the newbie. Buy,sell, consult. Small marketing campaign and from there word of mouth should do the trick.
Doing business with Indians in the US I have found that they network extremely well and once a product or service is liked by a respected member of their social circle it quickly becomes a must have for everyone in that circle. This is especially true when said product or service saves money.

Look you guys if big players wanted they could prop the market and cause another bubble or increased price. It's simple to do actually...price is doing this for a reason and it's not because bitcoin is failing. 
Don't you think there would be another bubble and a mass dump if this was going to fail? The prices is stabilizing and will grow organically on it's own. Not from some fake mt gox pump
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:34:20
That's why I come on here to tell people to relax. These guys are  idiots and are just trolling.   
Just hold your coins like I said before there's not much left to short in terms of BTC  true market value. There is a off OTC  demand for coins that's setting a price that has more bearing than these manipulated exchanges.  These shorters are losing all they made in the decline pressing their bet. 
Notice how quiet the trolls and nay sayers are. Rub in their face like do us! Shorters are gamblers NOT investors. VC betting millions on BTC ride with the winners!!

Yeah well it was up to mid 600s not that long ago and held there for awhile. It will go back up... Then back down. I will tell you this though when it makes a bull run you won't have time to get in before it jumps 300-400 a coin. Then you will wish you got in at 470. 
Just ride it out. At worst we see several more bubbles ( pumps) with opportunities for nice profits if you buy in now. The best times to buy have always been when the trolls are out in full force and uncertainty is at it's peak. Buy, buy, buy.

Yes they are but be careful. As a holder you should be prepared to be tested. Just a hunch, I think they may push the price down even further before any type of launch.

Then ask the exchanges to stop shorting with leverage. Bitcoin is not ready for 50x leverage. Shorting with leverage is a way for non believers /Greedy traders to destroy the tech while making money.

Then after the big boys pry the bitcoins from your cold dead weak hands they will slowly pump this beast to kingdom come.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:53:27
Bitcoin is not broken.  What's broken are the exchanges allowing 50-1 leverage to short the price. There is a organized group of individuals who work together to profit from this. It's not a conspiracy.... It's the truth. The day these exchanges allowed this the price started to decline. Why did price start to recover with Bstamp offline?
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:42:51
It's fun to watch but what's causing this is obvious. Bitcoin is near its ATH and seems to have settled there. Bag holders are finding themselves with more cash than they have had in a long time. This is enabling them to risk/gamble on alt coins. You can see there is a massive pump on about every significant alt coin out there. Beware of the dump!

@_date: 2017-11-12 20:16:15
The way for hodlers to hang tough in these situations is easy. Whenever something seems hard (holding while BTC drops) and you can refrain from dumping to buy BCH/ETH ....etc like the herd you are doing the right thing. Watch as people's legacy stacks shrink to get into BCH and then baaam! BCH dumps and there goes all your hard earned profit. 
Don't fall for it. It's always hardest to go down the right path.

If I remember correctly...historically we have seen a run up pre auction and a drop after the coins were sold. 
Technically it shouldn't effect price as most coins purchased seem to be by holders or investors who sell coins off market. These investors are looking for a discount and typically wouldn't be buying on a sharp increase like we are seeing now. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:42:10
You guys are playing with fire. I hope your not shorting on leverage right now. I have a feeling when banks open Monday all short margins will fall like dominos. Be careful. NOBODY cares about the ETF decision didn't u guys learn that last time.  A "no" has already been priced in. ETF has already been rejected why do u think this crash started.

You pay a 40% tax/penalty when you withdraw from your 401k and most places only give you 60 days until your required to pay it back... otherwise you lose 10% in a penalty and also have to pay state/federal tax
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:22:46
Percentage wise it's still the same. Your only losing/gaining (x%) of your original investment. So the argument stands $100 swings at $1600 are no more significant than $25 at $400. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 13:42:26
Agreed, they don't get it. The ETF has zero permanent effect on price. Day traders may get a chance to buy at a 10-15% discount if it's disapproved and that's about it. If price falls many including myself will be right there ready to buy. 
I'm even inclined to say an ETF rejection is better for Bitcoin in the long run.

Yes. I'll buy all the way up and all the way down because you can't call tops. It could be millions some day and $2000 will seem like $2 dollars does right now. 
Once I realized the government doesn't have an agenda to destroy BTC a light when on in my head. Get in now or regret it. Honestly what investment (or business even) shows the potential for this much upside? The risk/reward ratio favors the reward side in droves. I'd say holding USD is 10x riskier than holding BTC in your portfolio. Just my opinion. 
Thing people fail to see is BTC isn't a gosh damn micro payment system. It never will be in its current state. It's the STANDARD and a store of value.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:21:38

Maybe we can peg the amount every coin is purchased for and database that info and use the total as another metric which could be regarded as more accurate that the current market cap metric. Kind of like coinbase does but then have an api that does it consistently across all mediums of exchange.

Now as far as what to do w the BTC. First off I'd take at least 10 BTC and buy ETH, LTC and maybe some long shots. Then I'd take another 5 BTC and buy physical silver. Then I would hold for at least 2 more years. Once your nest egg equals a few million then you can worry about women and retirement. Until then MOB!
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:05:35
Let the fappening happen. Then what lol? You have one coin worth 350-400 and one worth 2500. Who cares about a perceived market cap. When I see ETH tickers on TV and ways to exit from ETH to fiat then I'll believe the fappening is close. 
Just so it's clear I own both.
