What if there's a point where everybody have BTC and wants to make money from BTC and try to sell at the same time? Isn't this money you enjoy now the lost money of someone who buys later? JUST ASKING.

Easy money? What for? Food? Clothes? Rich people don't need more money, they have basic needs covered.

Why is the price important?

Then they go to hell.
@_date: 2016-01-24 10:11:02
Ah ok, it's like a game? Maybe it's funny to make money you don't need... I didn't considered that point of view.
@_date: 2016-01-25 08:30:14
Is something that I'm learning from Cognitive Psychology, after a lot of years suffering from constant insatisfaction... Water and food, that's all what you need to be happy.
@_date: 2016-01-24 23:02:57
Hahahahaha, the metric of their success??? The only success in life is Happiness and you can have it with basic needs guaranteed and love. Everything else is just a funny game.

Is there a patch for such a bug?

In my case, money correlates with anxiety...
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:30:06
How is the amount established?
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:50:47
But where's my wallet and how is controlled and by who?
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:12:35
The only money I have is 55€ and I'm 24 years old. And I want to die too. I guess money makes no difference.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:14:56
Does money represent real wealth?
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:17:35
After some days of anxiety symptoms I keep asking this question to myself...

Yeah but what about the feeling of pride and accomplishment that comes with earned money through hard and meaningful work?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:57:24
I thought money was a tool to represent value and it was earned through hard and meaningful work. That's what my parents and society teached me. They told that if I study and work hard, I will have money and a happy life. I guess it's all false. Fuck everything. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:04:12
It was a joke. Nobody here knows about the EA comment?

Well, I don't have any problem with this. If a police dron can protect me in the middle of the night from a psychopath killer, then fuck yeah! In my paradise world, police can help you everywhere, everytime. Remember that they exist to protect your rights and to protect you from yourself too (if you violate other's rights). On the other hand I don't have any problem with an algoritm analizing how much gay porn I watch: that's even better because this AI could advice me and connect me with other people (like emo gay boys; I don't know where to find them...).
You must understand that we live in democracies where laws are voted and created. The more technology we have, the more freedom: we will vote laws directly without needing greedy politicians. And, of course, consider police like cars. Human errors are the problem, not AI precision. A human policeman could hate you, an AI will treat you as an equal to the law, no matter you skin's colour.
Don't worry, new technology tends to scare people but history shows us that it's the best way to better our lifes. I would allow an algorithm to spy me if that helps to detect terrorist and other sick people, why not? The more data and intelligence you put in a system, the more precise and incorruptible it is, protecting us from human emotions and obsessions.

You know, money is actually gold. But it worked till 1971 so we changed the paradigm of money by unlinking it from gold allowing major financial flexibility in order to defeat URSS by technological disruptions. Now we have troubles because of that and we need to go far beyond money itself (income inequality and software/hardware productivity are the problems). Bitcoin is virtual gold that holds a better equilibrium to our economy (it will) by the reasons you already know. 
The trend says that we are shifting to a digital civilization where bits are more important than atoms. So I can't wait for using Bitcoins to buy a nice place in a VR metaverse instead of wasting paper and coins to buy food. But that's the Peter Diamandis idea of Abundance and it's a long story...

Free and efficient energy will reduce GDP? I don't think so because there are costs to cover in the energy transition.
@_date: 2015-10-03 20:52:30

You're saying that a lack of energy will drive to a recession? Interesting...
