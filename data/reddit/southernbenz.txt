Yes, they certainly do. I’d recommend donating to the NRA ILA, specifically. 
It takes a lot to face Everytown and Brady.

NRA (edit: NRA-ILA) or Second Amendment Foundation.
Both are truly fantastic.  
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:14:15
I'm so fucking sorry.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:56:47
NRA-ILA *online* contributions are limited to $5,000.  However, you can call and arrange larger donations.  There is no maximum limit.

No, that completely different.

It's a mixture of Bonds and Bitcoin.

    The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.  The second best time is right now.

Let's pretend he made $15,000,000 on Ethereum.  
He would have needed to invest $35,000... in 2015.  No, I do not believe an individual person risked *that* kind of money putting it into an unknown penny-stock crpyto in 2015.  
Bitcoin?  Yeah, it's possible.
Ethereum?  Nope.

Speak for yourself. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:58:38
How are you defining "duplicate?"
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:08:49
please help. 
This isn't a duplicate. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:04:57
You, yourself, made tens of millions of dollars on crypto? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:32:10
I'll sell you one moderately used Cat5 cable for $4.000 USD.  
But that's about it.

Where are these karma fucking bitches you speak of? 
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:02:25
Don't tell me what to do. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:42:28
That pricing is way too high.  How much are you making on this referral? 20%?

Finally, solid advice. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:27:33
Yes, that makes sense.

Unfortunately, it's also used in network engineering and CS as something completely irrelevant.
