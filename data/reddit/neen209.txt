Depends on how much you’re buying, but I would say now...trying to time the market is very difficult...
It’s like buying a house...screw if the market is up or down, if you can afford to buy, do it...I learned that the hard way trying to time the market

What makes me laugh the most is when people compare BTC to tulip mania
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:26:48
Your Mom is awesome
Hope it works out for you guys
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:24:52
Welcome my friend
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:44:10
You can grow tulips too

I thought we currently have net neutrality, and they’re trying to take it away?
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:07:53
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:25:36
I’m confused

Bovada gives you the option to getting cashed out in bitcoin which is pretty cool...
You can but in with fiat &amp; get paid in BTC
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:22:53
Literally everything they’re saying is happening lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:09:08
Good move bro...there will always be another good time to buy
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:06:06
I’m pretty sure he sold
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:25:55
The reward highly outweighs the risk
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:04:45
Touché 
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:28:00
Why should we believe you? Like you stated previously, you are down on your bitcoin investment. That somewhat tells me that you have no idea what is going to happen, therefore your opinion does not matter
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:27:01
Same lol
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:43:05
Honestly, I think any time you have extra money is a good time to buy, but I’m not too sure brother...I have just seen uncertainty cause bitcoin to drop in the past...did anything regarding net neutrality get released yet? 
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:44:23
Sorry bro...I reckon that I’m the one that makes the best farts
Haha happy Father’s Day bro, you got an awesome kid &amp; im sure you’re an awesome dad!!

I never said they couldn’t, but this is not the first time coinbase has had this issue...
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:33:20
That’s tough man...
Do you think Google stock will double in value before Bitcoin does?
I have no advice for you &amp; wish you the best...I just feel like ATM Bitcoin is trending and growing at a rapid pace...and still not even like 2% of people own any bitcoin...good luck on your investments!!
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:32:29
Yeah...very sensitive market, so I think any negative news will affect the price....probably won’t be for long though
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:58:18
Show them your bills &amp; ask them to lend a helping hand
@_date: 2019-12-13 09:46:43
Hmm that’s pretty interesting...
@_date: 2019-12-15 10:29:08
I understand the point you’re trying to make, and I agree with your perspective on things
But “market” stands for current selling price/action
Like when you go into one of them fancy restaurants that we all can no longer afford &amp; on the menu you see “market price” for that oh so delicious lobster
So again, I’m on your team, but current market price action has been bearish. Extremely bearish for people that bought at the top around 6 months ago...they lost almost half of their investments
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:49:37
Lol is this your guys first rodeo? Happens every time there is big movement going on...
Their not going no where...they have it so good...signing up thousands by the day and making crazy amounts of money off high fees...
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:29:17
Billions are entering crypto everyday...that’s the main thing that’s tripping me out...

@_date: 2018-03-09 08:48:57
Hey bro I’m really sorry...just try not to let it get the best of you &amp; good luck in the future
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:03:26
