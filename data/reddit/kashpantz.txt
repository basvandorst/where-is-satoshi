Hopefully people are wise to take this as a joke as coins other than BTC have done better this year.

Does that equal 1 Bitcoin?

I wonder where it will go.

Good point. I have no problem with Bcash. It will serve a purpose but 12 year olds hijacking r/btc is insane. I had a thought tho.... Maybe because they missed the boat with bitcoin they ate trying to get a second chance with Bitcoin Cash? I dunno

The truth is that, generally speaking, a little bit of inflation is usually great.
But a lot of inflation is deadly. It can create uncertainty, reduce our incomes and – in extreme cases – even wipe out our wealth altogether.

This brings us back to the question on Twitter: Where did the ECB get this $3 trillion??
According to the ECB’s Chief Economist Peter Praet, they just printed the money out of thin air! We obviously all know this is what central banks are doing, but the fact that they are comfortable enough to brag about it so nonchalantly on Twitter shows how untouchable they feel

Ok I don't know which country you live in but in Australia, if you pay the banks late you have to pay 19.74% in interest and that's from NAB.
You are correct on the second point tho. Currently if you go through a centralized company it can be blocked, but soon enough when more things become decentralized it will be almost impossible to shut down. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 22:57:35
Ok I won't get into this too deep but if you have ever used a bitcoin mixer then you will see that bitcoin can't be traced if you use one. It mixes transactions with other people making it hard if not very confusing to trace. They came out on the dark web when they realised bitcoin is traceable. This is why I don't see the point of privacy coins as these mixers pretty much make it so confusing to where you have been and where you went.

I guess most people who come into this forum have bank accounts or are from a devoloped country where the banking system works pretty well. But that's one sided. Not to say people who are poor in 1st world countries because they exist. Not everyone can get a bank account to join that club, but that's the world we live in.
Bitcoin has changed that. Getting that card was so easy. Still happy people can come on here for a conversation. I normally don't get to have these conversations in public.

Think of your fractional Bitcoin as proof that you have the solution to one of a finte number of solutions to a complex mathematical problem. In principle, it is perfectly fungible…Your .0003 Bitcoin should be worth exactly what any other ,0003 Bitcoin is worth. Comparing or exchanging them should be as pointless as exchanging your $10 bill with someone who gives you a valid $5 bill and five $1 bills. There is simply no difference.

While Bitcoin’s volatility has so far been dominated by speculative demand, real demand is slowly forming. This means that the volatility of Bitcoin will be undergoing an evolution in which it will organically decrease across time. Understanding the maturation of these drivers is essential to determine what is the appropriate weight of crypto assets within a portfolio.
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:04:31
I get that. I do. But we are talking about what has already happened in 2017,this isn't rocket science. I think it comes down to crypto is a serious player in the financial sector and banks should be worried.

Progress. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 07:55:30
Yes, so the term supply and demand come into play. The 10 btc I bought in 2012 cost me 172$ Now guess how much that is worth today? Try and do that with a fiat currency... It's not going to happen because the US dollar for example is the world's reserve currency with around 20 trillion in debt.
Do you see where I'm going with this? I'm trying to understand the kind of people who come to these forums to be honest. Mostly new people to crypto which is fine, it's a rabbit hole you fall down and really hits you on the head when you realise what has been created.

But what about a financial crises? Where is that extra cash coming from when banks need a bail out? 
@_date: 2018-11-08 07:28:44
Yes, don't pay late is easy to say. Most people borrow money they they don't have. 19% is a shit load of cash to pay interest on. But yeah don't pay late.
Yeah I think it's pretty cool because this is the beginning. When new things start they are more expensive at the start and become cheaper in the future. But when you can use a currency that isn't tied to banks or the government messing with the economic policy then its actually quite liberating. Still has a long way to go but things are slowly changing.

How is this clickbait? You can read the whole page. This just displays that some people read the title and don't read the rest. It's pretty obvious. There was no grand scheme here, I talked to the mod about it and he set the complaints to this post he was getting set to ignore.

Think of your fractional Bitcoin as proof that you have the solution to one of a finte number of solutions to a complex mathematical problem. In principle, it is perfectly fungible…Your .0003 Bitcoin should be worth exactly what any other ,0003 Bitcoin is worth. Comparing or exchanging them should be as pointless as exchanging your $10 bill with someone who gives you a valid $5 bill and five $1 bills. There is simply no difference.

The national debt (or government debt) of the People's Republic of China is the total amount of money owed by the government and all state organizations and government branches of China. As of October 2018, it stands at approximately CN¥ 36 trillion (US$ 5.2 trillion), equivalent to about 47.6% of GDP. America has 22 Trillion.

This is still happening and will continue to grow. If electricity is more expensive than producing a bitcoin then simple economics won't permit it to last for long. This will encourage cheaper energy so they can maximise profits.

You don't research much do you?
Everything on the bitcoin network is transparent. You can search and look into every wallet made because its made available to the public.
Criminals are harder to catch using fiat currency. Every transaction on the bitcoin network is recorded on a public ledger that anyone can see. Thus making it transparent and easier to catch people doing illegal activities.

Yeah I get that but the beautiful think about bitcoin is it encourages either cheap energy or renewable energy otherwise it isn't worth mining and then they start to run at a loss and most likely shut off their machines.
