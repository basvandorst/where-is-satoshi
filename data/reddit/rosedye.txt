Since, I didnt pay for electricity, it was technically "free money"

I didn't care after hearing someone spent so many bitcoins for a pizza. I legit found them "useless". COOL concept but useless. I equated it to Neopoints (from neopets)?

I see why there is confusion as I said I "brought" them. I gave my laptop to be used for by miners as the process would run on my laptop every night. I was in highschool (or end of middle school) and saw this as one of the opportunities to make "free money".
Later, I realized it might be one of those scams where it is like make money online for free when in reality you don't get anything.

lost few bitcoins (dont remember amount) because I forgot my wallet seed :(. I had brought many right after the white paper got released and held on SO much that I forgot the seed. :/

Does this mean transaction fees is lowered?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:33:26
Yeah, I mined them.

Oh, I don't really. Foresight is 20/20.

I just bring it up whenever someone claims they've been in bitcoin for a long time and I am just a "newbie" :P I estimate the loss to be around 100k but again I wouldn't have enough thought it would value that high. EVER.

Lol you don't have to.

Makes sense! Thank you for educating me! :) 
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:52:28
Alright. Thank you! Why wouldn't the community prefer something like IOTA (no fees) over bitcoin?

Why will people mine once a supply of 21 million is reached in bitcoin? Who will provide the miners some bitcoin to continue mining?
