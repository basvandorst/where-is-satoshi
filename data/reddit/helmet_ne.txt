Not really considering it is at .0001 today. But it definitely looks like a good time to buy.

Are you saying you can't be proud of something unless someone recognizes you for it? Some people don't necessarily need that validation from others to find enjoyment or pride in the things they do.

I've gotten Doge once or twice too and didn't do anything with it. However, with bitcoin actually being used by businesses now it seems more like something worth spending the time on. IMO the value and usefulness of bitcoin seperates it from most other crypto-currencies.

As a person who just received their first bitcoin via a tip yesterday, I don't think it is stupid at all. I have been interested in bitcoin, but not enough to put the energy into really researching how to obtain or use them. Now that I have actually been given some, even in a small amount, I have a somewhat vested interest and even set up a wallet, something I would not have done without the tip being given to me. I imagine there are very many people who are in the same boat and who will not take the time to embrace this until they actually have some coin given to them.

My mistake - I was looking at American Green which is what the article stated as the company producing these machines. - Another mistake was to not make sure this was the same American Green.

I don't think he is proud of losing the money. I think he is proud of the fact that he is an early adopter of what will very possibly be the future of currency and that he will continue to support the idea, even if he no longer has funds to invest.
