Even if he is a con man it doesn't prove anything. He could be Satoshi Nakamoto himself.
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:34:33
That's the problem, you don't have proof he isn't. Most people hold the same opinion without convincing evidence.
On the other hand, the supporting evidence is powerful. The original paper had a british slant and it turns out Craig is british. He is also a cypherpunk, who writes reseach papers and holds two master degrees in related fields.
If he is a fraud, he is not an average one.

If you can look past his rude exterior, you will see he knows what he is talking about.
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:44:30
Have you read his last paper? The illusion of scale in segregated witness 
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:46:01
I think this is important news and deserves serious debate. Not ad hominems and name calling.
He makes interesting points besides his boorish style of presentation.
@_date: 2017-07-14 22:01:29
Thank you. Good point.
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:49:47
Have you actually listened to the presentation?
@_date: 2017-07-15 03:35:25
Howard Hugues was a "con man" too and he was a genius.
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:46:43
Sure, keep sneaking into my profile. As you can see, I am not a paid shill.
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:02:47
Yes, thanks for mentioning it. Here it is: 
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:38:27
Google is close to demonstrating quantum supremacy and you are talking about aliens? I would be worried.

It's irresponsible to state quantum computers are a few decades away while ignoring the state of the art in the field.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:14:24
Quantum computing can also be a problem for hardware and pool centralization since they would be incredibly effective in mining bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:22:15
Maybe we will use a quantum internet or at least post-quantum encryption.
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:09:24
Thanks for the link, but proven is an overstatement.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:48:50
Thank you. What are the benefits of being a simple node?
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:03:17
False, bitcoin is not quantum resistant. Read the article.
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:00:42
The future is unpredictable, if you put all your faith on bitcoin you could lose a lot. Technology is shifting all the time.
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:29:51
Thank you. Interesting take on bitcoin. Open source and decentralization can indeed make it survive against all the odds. That said, there is no guarantee it will prevail against it's present and future competitors.
Right now, most mainstream cryptocurrencies are not quantum proof (BTC, ETH, ZEC). The only one thus far is IOTA because of it's tangle technology and Winternitz One-Time Signature Scheme, a post quantum signature.
I guess bitcoin, ethereum and the rest will update their security in due time.
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:23:20
You are citing data for Grover's algorithm, but Shor is more effective for SHA-256:
"Shor’s algorithm reduces the runtime of cracking elliptic curve cryptography from O(2k/2) to O(k3) – that is to say, since Bitcoin private keys are 256 bits long, the number of computational steps needed to crack them goes down from 340 trillion trillion trillion to a few hundred million at most."

"By the end of 2017, Google hopes to make a 49-qubit chip that will prove quantum computers can beat classical machines"
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:01:33
Thanks for pointing out the delusion that bitcoin will take care of itself. Quantum computers are being developed by big companies like Google, IBM and Microsoft right now and it's clear the government has interest in it as well.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:00:35
Yes, but it's not just cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology but the better understanding and application of P2P, also seen in new ideas like IPFS and OpenBazaar.
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:00:41
I doubt the writer of this article needs this explanation, but good luck anyway. He is one of the foremost experts in blockchain and creator of Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:59:27
Not true, a quantum computer running a modified version of Shor's algorithm can break SHA256 easily. The only know quantum proof encryption algorithm in bitcoin is RIPEMD-160, because a quantum computer using Grover’s algorithm would take too long to break it.
So bitcoin is only partially protected against quantum computers and with exposed public keys it's vulnerable.
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:59:27
SHA-256 is not post quantum cryptography :
"it is known for sure that it would take a sufficiently large quantum computer on the order of only 1283 basic quantum operations to be able to break a Bitcoin key using Shor's Algorithm. This might take some time, especially since the first quantum computers are likely to be extremely slow, but it is still very practical."
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:03:41
It's true regardless if he was the first one or not. The important thing here is context, P2P is making a huge comeback.
