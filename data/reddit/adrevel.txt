VOS is also $1.50 to deposit up to $2000 or $2500 I think. It's in your account within an hour. Then 0.40% trading fee. Volume is still really low, especially after they stopped the free trading promotion they had going.
What are the typical markup % on Localbitcoins or OTC? I thought it was 3-5%+ or something? But I haven't really checked.
If there are cheaper ways to buy/trade coins I'd appreciate the sharing of knowledge ;)

Thanks brother!

Awesome. I spent a year in SEA with 3 months of that time in Thailand. It depends on the person but I personally wouldn't recommend staying very long in Bangkok unless you really like big cities. Chiang Mai is so much cheaper and laid back, maybe more expensive to fly to other countries compared to flying from Bangkok.

Nice summary of what it's like to be an investor over at BLC. I've had some really good returns there. Of course it's necessary to do your due diligence and take into consideration the risks of each and every borrower.

That's cool, thanks for the links. I've seen people tipping before but I never knew how it works.
I like those fun tip amounts too!

You probably shouldn't buy from that ATM anymore haha. That's a terrible price. Try localbitcoins or any other equivalent in your area.

I love being able to easily transfer money across the world. No more long wait times and crazy fees!

Thank you brother! I appreciate it. Just started learning how the whole tipping thing works  =)  Will pay it forward!

I haven't been to Thailand in a few years but I don't think this is exactly how it works. First of all I got a visa on arrival with no onward ticket.  I think the double entry tourist visa is good for 60 days, you can extend it to 90, so after a visa run you get another 60 days and extend another 30 so 180 in total.
Also they've just become more restrictive on people continually doing visa runs. If you have the double entry visa it should be fine but I'm not entirely sure what you will have to do after your 6 months is up.

BLC for sure. Better management that actively looks out for scammers. They make a profit only when payments on loans are made, compared to BTCJam that receives their fees regardless of whether the borrower defaults or not.
I'm part of a Bitcoin Investment Group on facebook where we help each other look out for scammers and find good investment opportunities. We often find information about borrowers to see if they are legit, etc. I almost exclusively invest in people who are part of this group.

I think the site looks really good. Changemoney.org makes my fan start blasting on my Macbook Pro though, not sure if that's normal.

I've been hoping a tipbot would be back in action! Cool!
