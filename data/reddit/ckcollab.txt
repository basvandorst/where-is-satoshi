Losing 25% on top of +1500% for the year on this volatile of an asset is not a tremendous loss. Can't really argue it any other way!
By the way I bought in at $1200 when it dipped to $200, did not worry me, because I bought for the right reasons and didn't get emotional :)
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:39:22
...tremendously? You remind me of some people in a local chat who said "bitcoin tanking!" after it goes from +1530% to +1500% gains :)
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:38:30
Solutions are coming....!
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:30:45


Well, yeah, if you are emotional and trying to cash out sooner than later... if you learned about how Bitcoin works and see a future in a couple years, then bought it, then the price matters much less.
So, yes, if you are emotional price *now* is important.
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:16:42
They are actually done. They just need to be adopted. Get to work! :)
Bitcoin isn't behind, it's ahead. Every single blockchain technology has the exact same scaling problems, because that's how consensus works (everyone knows). When everyone knows everything, of course it can't scale.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:59:08
Yeah I'm just trying to explain that everything you're saying is already happening, and it just takes a bit of time. Takes even more time for shit coin to do.

Aye, developers understand that you can't be greedy with resources..!
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:39:09
You can do any number of transactions you want. You can also do a lower priority transaction to get your "lightning wallet" ready later. Pay $5 to put $1,000 in a lightning wallet and you can wait for that $1,000 to run out. Maybe BTC price goes up fast enough that you *never* need another on chain transaction....! :)
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:16:47


Why did OP buy? Because price was zooming up, or because 5 years from now they believe BTC will have great adoption?


If bitcoin crashed to $10 then that would be a huge overall loss for the year, not +1500%...
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:46:01
Still doesn't change the fact that +1530% to +1500% is not a tremendous loss. Doesn't matter how emotional they are.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:31:16
Like what?
@_date: 2014-08-16 01:42:54
Not really true
1) There are protection options, and it's *almost* as much risk as just using CC/whatever
2)  you can spend bitcoin with a debit card
3) If you don't get it... you just don't get it. Maybe to you 1-2% in fees is "whatever" and your paypal will never get frozen. Many people have to deal with these problems and even worse fees, it helps tons and tons of people. Businesses like Amazon who run on 1-2% margins could DOUBLE their profits!

Thanks for doing an AMA :)
@_date: 2014-08-16 19:06:51
1) Huh? Same as any other credit card/etc. Look at xapo.
2) Yep pretty sure that's how it works. There's not a lot more incentive here, but it's easy to use. As easy to use, no central regulating authority, extremely low fees, and trustless... it's going to get used. Ever had to transfer money to another country? Ever had to transfer millions of dollars? Ever had to do many, many small transactions? Ever had to implement a payment gateway? Ever have to implement PCI? Overstock implemented bitcoin payments in 10 days...
3) Sure, but it's true. Given the same explanation 2 people can come out with different views. When I look at Xapo I am like "problem solved." When you look at it, you're not looking at it the same way. Having insurance on my bitcoin and a card to use it is awesome, it's like the good of banks + the good of bitcoin. No one is in control of my money but me: I don't have to deal with weird bureaucratic red tape, arbitrary rules/rates/fees, potentially getting my money frozen, etc. That's all I'm saying. 
4) 1-2% fees. Yeah, uh, if amazon is saving 1-2%, so are you eventually... why wouldn't some competitor offer lower prices because they no longer have that overhead? Why would they keep selling at the same rates??? I believe if you use bitcoin on newegg, tiger direct, overstock they all give you discounts. Not sure.
@_date: 2014-01-25 11:34:04
You know, that doesn't make much sense. I don't know if you'll be able to make back .56 BTC mining at ~750khs...
I think you would have been WAY better off just buying an alt coin instead of buying hardware. It's just so much more cost effective...

$8/day today, at $1300 difficulty.
Take a look at this [chart]( -- do you think people are just going to let easy money go?
EVERYONE is buying cards so the difficulty is going up. Dogecoins are halving in less than a month so your 4800 doge turns into 2400 doge, but that even becomes less because difficulty will go up with the increase in value of rarer coins!
Believe me man, I made the same mistake. I could have bought $1k doge (3 million at the time) instead of a mining rig. I'd have almost $10k now if I did that...
With your 0.5BTC you could have bought 250000 doge coins which would have been a decent investment, betting that dogecoin becomes extremely valuable. On the flip side, if you would have kept that 0.5BTC alone maybe THAT becomes super valuable, so that's also a good bet.
Instead, you buy a $500 graphics card that won't generate hardly anything.  You're running it at max capacity 24/7, it won't last years but maybe 3-9 months on average.
The only value in this is that it's a fun hobby. This is not the profitable way to crypto.
Also, for fun, mind linking your middlecoin so we can see your progress?
EDIT 
If you've gotten a payout yet I mean!
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:24:44
I think you're right that you can get away with one dev, however to introduce new features, write tests and fix bugs you'll need at least a handful of developers. Probably dozens if the site gets popular, you'll have a guy who just does analytics. A guy who just does user experience. A guy who just does API support/development. A guy who focuses on the exchange (optimization, adding new coins, etc.)... I mean I could come up with a million things that could warrant a dedicated dev.
@_date: 2014-01-25 20:01:26

I'd love to contribute, but I'm pretty confused about everything OpenBazaar is doing. I see a ton of stuff for configuring a storefront and all this customization... why is that part of OpenBazaar? Shouldn't OpenBazaar be a simple API and leave it up to whoever to wrap some kind of frontend/features around it? It seems like that'd make it a lot more simple?

@_date: 2019-04-05 22:54:38
@_date: 2016-02-13 15:46:26
Well, you could look up the benefits of Django Rest Framework and see if it appeals to you, that's what I'd recommend. But to give my opinion: DRF takes care of a lot of the overhead/boilerplate (requiring less tests), has a nice separation of data (serializers) and logic (views), implements standards for you, comes with prebuilt documentation, prebuilt with tester as well, and Django's migrations/orm/models are beautiful.
For an example, check out some [API code]( and [docs]( (autogenerated) I'm writing for a learning platform.
@_date: 2016-09-18 10:17:32
Totally, I mean, there are tons of solutions to that. Make water cooling a requirement, suspend the CPU internals in cooled circulating oil, etc. etc.
For a wacky alternative that may come in the next 60yrs: Ray Kurzweil talks about carbon nanotubes (IIRC) that somehow self-assemble to form insanely powerful processors. Robust, self-repairing, and fault tolerant. I think these carbon nanotubes would be somehow designed to assemble into shape while suspended in some gel. 
They would have the same power as all human minds ^ 10. Kinda makes me think maybe humans are the caterpillar in the cocoon, just waiting for robo jesus to emerge.
@_date: 2016-09-18 05:53:28


Uh-doy! :)
Of course their size may hit some limit, but there's a lot more headroom to find. Not to mention materials **other than silicon** -- what I really meant was "what does silicon's limit have to do with Moore's Law ending?" Who knows what the next material/CPU will be like. Carbon nanotubes suspended in some weird gel, an organic like structure? Oh, neat!
@_date: 2016-09-18 10:42:01


OK, let's not try to get into the weeds on how to solve this right now, but... you could just make very small independent processors...

Never said being diligent and keeping people honest was easy.


That's why people are skeptical of reviews.. this problem is being solved. People, for niche products, have reviewers they trust.
What system do you propose would work better than the free market, to solve this problem?

You're different from the guy I was replying to, but, yeah, my "go-to" answer to "where is any free market" is USA a while ago :)
That definition seems OK, however I was hoping to hear what they thought, since they said `libertarians base their theories hopes and wishes on fantasies.` Eh, it's pretty clear to me from Nobel Prize winning economists like Milton Friedman that the [free market]( is pretty amazing, especially at overcoming discrimination.
@_date: 2016-09-23 21:39:21
Eh, I did provide info:
[Some info](
Here's the definition for "market":


So, do people gather on the Internet and purchase goods? What restrictions are there on those goods? Can someone go on the dark web and buy (literally) anything they want? Is that the freest market we've seen? I'd say so. Free from many constraints: don't have to be near someone, no one can stop you, no one can spy on you (if done properly), and can communicate with anyone.


**Here are some other questions/clarifications I was wondering about:**


What does that *mean*? Can they *stop mesh networks*?


Ah, so when you go downtown, that's not a market? 


Can you re-word this?


Can you re-word this, as well?
@_date: 2016-09-18 05:48:39
Aye, there's way too much profit to be made to not make the next big leap advancing processing power.
@_date: 2016-09-22 16:11:15


Yep, it would be, in a free market :) 
There would be analytics companies, as there already are, helping you find the best product. See angies list, reviews, etc. etc. which actually aren't performing as well as they should. So now we have new tools rising to that challenge like review meta that weeds out fake reviews on products. Free market at work!


And not just free information -- information which is distributed and consumed constantly and voraciously.
This is pretty much how it works right now...? I agree free market needs free information (I'd argue that's part of free market, anyway). How does the current system handle the mass amount of information?
I feel like the Internet is really solving this already. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 20:42:27

How can you control that? It's a market that **actively resists** being controlled...
[Some info](


Ah, so when you go downtown, that's not a market? 


Can you re-word this?


Can you re-word this, as well?
The "Internet" (not sure how *you'd* define it) is just a predefined way for computers to talk to each other, this is independent of method/country/whatever. It **is the most free market we've ever seen**. Barriers to entry are low. Censorship is near impossible. Taxes nearly non existent.

@_date: 2016-09-22 16:35:50


This is what I quoted and was specifically replying to, your definition of free market matters if I'm going to find one.


The definition says gov't can't intervene `laws and forces of supply and demand`, i.e., you can't stomp out competition by making hemp illegal.
As for an example of a "free market" in the current world, I would consider the Internet, basically, free market. You can put anything on there (dark web), do anything (mesh network, not necessarily reliant on ISP), and speak to anyone (pgp). Even "firewalled" countries like Iran, people can get on the Internet.

@_date: 2015-03-15 04:46:09
I haven't done C# in forever, how was working with bits easier than Python? I remember using Structs and such, pretty easy, but I've seen similar things in Python--haven't used them though. I'm not sure being dynamically typed would matter much, either... could you expand on that a little? Might give me some new perspective!
Also, wouldn't the Python library abstract away the bit manipulation aspects, making it easier for code review and lower barrier to entry?
@_date: 2015-03-19 06:31:00


Re-reading what you posted: you're right, I made assumptions that you were trying to get more developers, not more **core code reviewers**.


I'm a developer as well, in non-ELI5 terms could you give me specific examples of why it's hard to do this in Python? I still don't understand and my glances at examples make it look easy...? Like, could you point to some piece of Bitcoin and show me why that's hard to do the same thing in Python?
AFAIK, doing this in Python or C# or Java or whatever... and when you're talking readability/low barrier to entry Python demolishes everything else. Want to get Math majors learning Bitcoin? I think Python is one way to help make that happen more often than anything else.
@_date: 2015-03-17 03:05:01
Really? There are probably hundreds or thousands of great examples of Python applications that scale like Dropbox, Reddit, Instagram for example. You should have unit tests covering these situations anyway. Relying on type checking is kind of silly especially for a scenario like a financial system, right?
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:42:28
You're right.
There are so many things wrong it's hard to find somewhere to start. The way the code is organized is not very Pythonic. It leads me to believe the people who are running this project are not very familiar with it. Better organization, like laying out the code so 1 class/function/file does 1 thing and 1 thing well... this just doesn't make as much sense.
@_date: 2015-03-17 03:02:50
 &gt; Except in the case of a Bitcoin client (or almost any network protocol client) you do care about those details.
Like what? I'm not misunderstanding abstraction--that's what I meant. Also, certain parts could be implemented in C and the easily used via Python... right?
For example, if I was using a Twitter library I'd want to do something like
    import twitter_api
    twitter = twitter_api.TwitterAPI(api_key=1234567890)
    for tweet in twitter.get_tweets("
        print tweet

Consumers are doing extra work, how? I'm saying: if you have bitcoin and you want to give it to someone, the fees will be less than a penny (probably). That's it.

Err, maybe YOU don't pay it, but every time you use your CC someone is charged somewhere around 1.9% + $0.30, typically...

It seems kind of weird, the source code is pretty awful as well...

Actually, I think there are cases where a 25% fee might be valuable. Like, say in Caracas, Venezuela where it is very dangerous to even have an ATM. Or, if it is an extremely low volume area that would otherwise not have service.

What code, in question, is odd? Using libraries is not unusual...

That's not the problem. Bitcoin and LN are hard to *use* now. As programmers.
We need standard libraries, best practices, etc. to emerge. It will take a decade or more, probably, to be rounded out properly. About half the time it took for development on the Internet to get so standardized. We have a lot of great software platforms to choose from, especially for web. Rails, Django, .NET, PHP is even *OK* now. Frontend Bootstrap, Semantic, Zurb, etc..

I don't understand what makes the API powerful, seems like you're just using the "REST" buzzword =\
@_date: 2018-12-19 03:32:11
I disagree. You get to *choose* who to trust, you don't have to do business with anyone.
The service they provide, custody, is going to make creating apps on LN much easier. I run a software company and we're very excited to make LN apps, but there are a lot of barriers. Custody, properly tracking/atomizing payments, etc... having a service take care of that is very handy.

There's no way to make rainbow tables not effective if they know the salt/whatever... ??? Like you said, the input space is small (vs like a large file of binary/whatever data)
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:35:38
Well, I think fundamentally the idea is great. The execution so far seems very strange...
