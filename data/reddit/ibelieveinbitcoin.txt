I would just buy coin with the money rather than invest in mining hardware. Mining isn't profitable at this scale.

So your argument is to let fewer people know about bitcoin to grow bitcoin? Your goal seems more about you making money than growing bitcoin into something used by the masses. 
Tipping is a cheap way of introducing the concept, and letting people actually use bitcoin. Growing the number of users is the a sensible way to increase adoption.

15 per day?
You'd need about 1200 TH, at current difficulty (as difficulty increases your return goes down). A 1TH miner will cost you thousands of USD, then you have to power them all.
In sort, you would be cheaper and safer buying 15 coins per day.

Forget it. You'll never break even with a mining rig. If you insist on mining buy an ASCI miner of some sort. The fact you're asking this shows a shocking lack of research.

From my experience such posts are actually referral links (banned in this sub), which you have to sign up to and get some free 'cloud mining' time. The person posting the refferal link gets a cut of free time for baiting users into signing up.
Ask yourself this some question, if they had a profitable way of earning coin, why would they be giving it away for free given they cover the costs of all the hardware, power and infrastructure. 
Your mileage may vary, just my takeb on things. Proceed with caution stranger. Also, good luck.
@_date: 2014-11-10 08:10:27
A whole 2 minutes worth of research? Search this sub for mining, read the responses then realise you're going to just buy coin.

OP said:


So I've been shilling for a few months now...posting anti-Bitcoin messages here and there and arguing with Bitcoin fans. I've been receiving checks from Big Banks and Corporations Inc. (BBaC) bi-weekly since I started, but I haven't received anything for a few weeks now. Is this something that others are experiencing? And is there a help line or forum that I can talk to? If I don't get paid something soon, I'll have to quit. Damn fiat.
Also, anyone have experience in begging for Changetips? How much BTC have you been able to make? That seems like the logical next move for me. I'm so ready to start doing everything in Bitcoin

Thank you so much! My first gold. If your goal is to use your considerable means to grow the ecosystem I think that encouraging more businesses to accept BTC would be fantastic. Better still if you started a service they could use (perhaps for a small fee) to add this facility.
Edit. That is to say, increasing the places where it can be spent would grow the ecosystem.

Your claimed behaviour (buying as much coin as you can and hoarding it away) is contrary to your stated goal of growing the user base. You claim your behaviour is the same as everyone else's. Given there's a limited number of coins, and you believe everyone just buys and holds, why would anyone else ever join this ever decreasing circle?
If you want people to take you seriously don't post logically flawed arguments and state your belief basis is that everyone is doing the same thing you are.
