What is it with Bitcoin security that no one can figure out exactly how hackers do it?
It's always a guess and soon people forget the whole thing ever happened.
Isn't anyone curious enough to investigate thoroughly?

Bitfinex has its own order book and hasn't relied on Bitstamp for a long time.

1000x is not typical, it's insane. Typical maximum would be something like 200x. Oanda, the largest FX broker in the US only provides a maximum leverage of 50x.

Want to give me a tip while you're drunk and don't know what you're doing?...
@_date: 2013-05-13 09:40:47
Lol! I was referring to the bitcointip bot. :D
Awesome answer, though.
@_date: 2013-03-09 11:25:53
Use his accounts.

The big thing to note in that press report is that they have 81k BTC!
@_date: 2013-09-08 17:01:58
Ok, thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-01 10:29:40
I'm skeptical you're going to get a better price doing all that.
@_date: 2013-03-18 19:38:43
You probably bought some bitcoins becore making this post. And now people are going to buy becore you do... so you make profit. Your post doesn't make any sense otherwise. Why would you announce you're going to buy and then get a worse price for your investment? I'm skeptical...
@_date: 2013-03-18 16:52:39
I wonder if people take their bitcoins less seriously than fiat money...
@_date: 2013-03-09 14:53:09
The highlight of the whole report :D
@_date: 2013-11-16 13:36:32
I did the same as you at one time, some guy on irc kept saying that the effect was noticeable even after I checked the charts for proof...
@_date: 2013-09-04 17:45:54
I personally use [Bitfinex]( it is in Hong Kong. 
I've successfully withdrawn from there using Wire.
Raphael (the admin) has been friendly and has helped in case of problems.
They have a combined orderbook with Bitstamp and allow margin trading at 2.5x.
@_date: 2013-04-17 07:11:10
I contacted Bitstamp support about limit orders before and they confirmed that the way I described it is how it should work. Maybe you could ask them yourself about your case?
@_date: 2013-03-19 16:04:54
If the bitcoin price suddenly dropped to say, $0.1/BTC, you would have a lot less purchasing power.
@_date: 2013-06-13 10:26:03
@_date: 2013-06-03 11:32:17
Too bad the charts are not updated anymore.

Important to note: (from TOS)
3.5 When buying or selling cryptocurrency, you are buying or selling from Coin Market **directly**. Coin Market does not act as an intermediary or marketplace between other buyers and sellers of cryptocurrency.
So, basically a bucket shop. Why call it an exchange, then?...
Bucket shops can control the price and clients' trades as they see fit, this is explained in the TOS.

It's worth noting Giancarlo doesn't speak for the entire company. He's been known to use the forum account to voice his private opinions...
@_date: 2013-10-27 19:23:50
What if he can't pay back? Is 3% worth the risk if all you have to do is keep the money you have?
@_date: 2013-06-11 05:30:15
It's called [TorBroker](
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:43:44
It's just a quick way to buy or sell as fast as possible. It doesn't mean they're paying extra as limit orders mean that they want to buy/sell at that price or _better_.

Open UDC seems to be for people who want to have a fair and open system that no single person can take advantage of. Seems like a good idea to me. The ideology is totally different so I guess it will attract a totally different type of person than bitcoiners.

If it has to be earned, it's not free by definition.

The heading says "Power Hash **Mning** (PHM)".
Might want to change that. :)
Also, forum thread url is incomplete.

Computers are much better in finding market cycles and patterns, if any exist, using different analyses that are much more thorough than a subjective EWT analysis. I wouldn't recommend it. They're out to get your money. :)

Too ambitious for one guy and a budget that small. Ridiculous.
The £66 pledged so far should tell you people something.
@_date: 2013-10-09 10:21:37
Maybe you should post to some shady cybercriminal forum instead?
@_date: 2013-05-21 05:28:33
In addition to that, traders at bitfinex are stuck with their long positions and can't trade at mtgox, only at bitstamp or internally. So they push bitstamp down with market ordets..
@_date: 2013-03-24 06:49:16
You should check out bitfinex if you haven't. You can lend/borrow bitcoins and short there..

Technically nothing will happen. There's nothing limiting how fast price can move, except the hardware of the exchanges during high activity. However, fast moves may mean bigger volume or less market depth. That might indicate a bubble building up and people buying as fast and as big as they can because it's going up. I think "too fast" is just a gut reaction to something unusual happening and not knowing why.
