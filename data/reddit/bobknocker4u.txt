I used to be skeptical at first but from hands on experience its just the same as any other p2p but most people choose paxful more when they want faster transactions 
@_date: 2018-09-25 08:35:14
it's normal (annoyingly so) 
@_date: 2018-09-17 08:06:40
This what made me stop using the platform tbh.
@_date: 2018-09-12 10:33:32
I've seen it coming. Lbc is losing users by the hour
@_date: 2018-10-17 10:39:34
Have you tried other exchanges?  
@_date: 2018-10-22 08:05:25
Yeah most trades there don't require IDs but it all depends on the seller if they would require one 
@_date: 2018-10-16 08:51:22
Couldn't have said it any better. Localbitcoins is experiencing an all time low in terms of trade volumes in the platform which I think...speaks volumes.

A general advice is investing in an amount you're prepared to lose. Don't let an investment damage your plans in life. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 07:50:10
Does this happen most of the time? 
@_date: 2018-10-16 08:22:24
Ofcourse it had something to do with their KYC
@_date: 2018-10-04 10:08:10
It's pretty standard for most platforms but its annoying how it keeps coming up 
@_date: 2018-10-16 08:44:28
P2Ps like paxful is a good start to anyone who's starting to get into buy/sell btc. There's still alot of vendors that don't require IDs there. If you don't mind KYC you can opt to choose localbitcoins but I heard it has the worst customer support among other p2ps.
@_date: 2018-10-31 10:28:13
I prefer p2ps, its more convenient for those who don't live near a bitcoin atm
@_date: 2018-10-24 11:04:56
There's been a rise in mobile money solutions in Africa and with crypto companies jumping in brings in financial inclusivity to those who need it the most. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 10:09:54
Seems a stretch but then again its not impossible to happen 
@_date: 2018-10-22 07:47:37
What do you mean 
@_date: 2019-02-13 11:52:04
This is why I think despite bitcoin plummeting down I think it's here to stay. Just a thought. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 21:57:31
Are people still recommending localbitcoins after it had a security breach

The myspace of p2ps

In other words: noobs 
@_date: 2019-01-16 09:52:58
I also don't see bisq taking off as one of the p2p sites that everybody will use.  
@_date: 2019-01-16 09:31:49
Due to their terrible support team people have started to doubt localbitcoin's credibility as a p2p platform
@_date: 2019-01-16 07:49:29
I don’t recommend people to use LocalBitcoins. I've been scammed there too many times and their support is known for being the worst at their jobs. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 08:57:01
I haven't thought about that before...interesting observation
@_date: 2019-01-16 09:48:26
Just wait and see. Localbitcoins will make its scam exit.
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:36:39
Wow, did Nokia purposely "leaked" this? 
@_date: 2019-01-09 11:06:35
I heard some people on reddit are planning to sue localbitcoins for fraud
@_date: 2019-01-09 11:09:17
It also violates terms and will put your account to risk. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 06:49:37
Did you know a lawsuit is being made against them
@_date: 2019-01-17 09:18:13
Yes.  I've already seen countless articles about criminals on localbitcoins it wouldn't be a big shock to all if localbitcoins does make a scam exit, its inevitable. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:35:13
You can't purchase bitcoin without some form of verification these days so it's no surprise that you're having trouble finding one. The closest thing that I could recommend is paxful, there's still alot of sellers in the site that don't require IDs.
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:17:16
Well, that's good news. How many other crypto-related companies are doing charity work these days?
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:10:25
Do you work for Hodl Hodl
@_date: 2018-12-19 14:21:42
That's actually true
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:05:25
Have you thought of other ways of purchasing bitcoin? (Also, I wish I was this invested in bitcoin back when I was younger) 
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:29:03
Hodl Hodl isn't 'holding up' these days. When was the last time people have heard anything new from them? 
@_date: 2018-12-26 11:44:15
I received tons of gift cards as presents  (I'm not even kidding when I say 'tons) and I'm looking over Reddit to see where I can use them. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:07:01
When was the last time people have heard anything about Bisq?   
People stick to what they know and trust.
