Pretty sure part of the reason for version 2.0, is so you don't have to jump through openmap hoops to add a business. In the 2.0 version, I did a search, then selected the option to 'add business'.

If you're in the US, there's an option to buy bitcoin for cash at storefront merchants. LibertyX.com started a service last week where you walk into one of 2500 shops in the US and buy a PIN number. Redeem that PIN on their website and you have your bitcoin within a few minutes. 
The shops are the places that sell prepaid calling cards and discount phones. I live in a large city, so there are five shops within a mile of me. I've used it twice. They sell at exchange rate with no fees at the moment.

Are you aware of the iOS wallet app already using this name? I contacted the developer of the bitWallet app to see if they were involved with this site. I love the bitWallet app and would check out the site   if the iOS developers were involved. 
Unfortunately they are not. Seems like bitWallet.cc is off to a bad start.

Please Snapcard, come to Los Angeles. I'll help.

Incredibly useful and beautiful spreadsheet. Thanks!

Is that a reference to the Good Wife bitcoin episode? :)

Excellent. .005 bitcoin

This is a great idea. I'd like to offer the same thing for my clients. I'm guessing you're probably using FileMaker to create the invoices. Would you be willing to post the template so others can follow in your footsteps? 
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:54:25
This sounds amazing. I would pay for that plugin - with bitcoin or dollars. :)
Keep us appraised or let is know when it's ready. Until then, I'll look into using your manual method.

I'm one of the three. I used my backup phrase to install Mycelium and recover the seed on an Android device. After moving my bitcoin to another iOS wallet, all was well. Happy to see the new version back in the App Store. Seems to be working fine now. Congratulations.

Good job. Thanks for doing this. Glad you went with LibertyX rather than the hoops people have to jump through for LocalBitcoins. LocalBitcoins is fine, but not always the best option for new users. 
One thing people don't mention about LibertyX is the minimum cash purchase. You have to buy at least $50. The denominations are $50, $100, $200 and $300.

I'm looking to use a Raspberry Pi to do the same thing. Raspnode comes close, but the display readout and web interface is much nicer on the Bitnodes project. Has anyone come close to porting the same software for Raspberry Pi?

You're absolutely right. My mistake. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:08:42
Looks interesting. Can't seem to 'click here' on my iPhone to load the envelope. Does it work with mobile devices?
@_date: 2015-07-07 01:38:05
LibertyX does *not* require an ID to buy. You need an email address to register with the website, but in-person cash purchase requires no ID. Some merchants ask for a phone number, but most will except 000-000-0000.

Thanks for the tip about CoPay. Amazing set of features. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:44:41
Unfortunately, Coinapult has dropped its Locks feature. Check out bitreserve.org instead.

A) Genuinely had no idea Mycelium used centralized servers before today. Thought it was an SPV wallet. Anyone know a way to set up accounts within bread wallet?
@_date: 2015-04-18 22:05:45
Interesting idea. Is there an iOS xpub import solution? Mycelium for iOS is not viable at the moment until they fix the bug from their last release. 
A benefit of the barber having the reusable QR code address on a 'bitcoin accepted here' sign is the promotion of bitcoin. It's in front of everyone's face. Hopefully there will be a positive impact from people seeing the sign.
@_date: 2015-04-23 00:00:53
Worked for me. That's how I got my barber to accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 17:32:36
Thanks for the info. But please, [say 'no' to vertical videos](

No, Bruce Q's on Los Feliz Blvd. Does Works of Art take bitcoin? Was hoping his place would be the first barbershop accepting in LA. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 01:43:07
[Inkfactory.com] ( has a cool sign generator. That's what I used.

He likes the idea of not paying fees when he's paid in bitcoin. His hands on education is giving hima better grasp of bitcoin than other's who ask me questions from a purely theoretical perspective. I'm the first bitcoin customer. But he has another person who's been trying to get him to accept bitcoin for a few months.
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:54:05
I introduced him to blockchain.info and explained the watch-only address he monitors on his iPhone. He understands the transaction isn't valid until it appears at the address we both use. This is mostly an experimental way to expose people to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-19 00:01:34
This is a zero-risk proposition for him. He's already been paid in cash. The agreement I made with him locks the price at the time of transaction. At the moment, the only hoop he has to jump through is show his QR code to a bitcoin paying customer and check the blockchain.info page I bookmarked on his phone. Setting up his credit card merchant account was far more involved.
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:45:40
Thanks. Wanted the initial experiences to be as easy as possible for him. If he wants to continue after the payoff amount, I'll switch him to multi-address use system like SnapCard or Bitpay.

How do I get TouchID to work? And why can't I send a payment?
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:15:39
Is anyone else having problems sending using the new version (1.1)? I tried sending a small amount and ...nothing.
@_date: 2015-02-08 05:16:54
Great idea. I'm going to try this around Southern California. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 19:52:41
What's wrong is that when I press the send button, nothing happens. It's as if the send button is deactivated. I thought it was the amount. So I changed the amount. Thought it might be an invalid address. Changed that as well. Still unable to send. 
Is no one else having this issue with the update? Do I need to delete the app and reinstall? I'm worried about losing the funds I have in the wallet since the backup function 'export wallet master key' doesn't seem to be working either. Not really trusting the app at the moment.

Same problem here. Trying to get a relatively tech savy friend to sign up for a Circle account has turned into an eight day ordeal. No idea how my parents would be able to navigate the process if my friend has these problems. 
What's happened since the service came out of invitation status? I signed up the first day it was available to the public. Now it feels like I got off easy. Like I was part of the flood of the rampaging horde.
