Agree, but what I like on the site is that they mark this kind of articles as Opinion in their Opinion section. A lott of sites bring it as news which is confusing for a lot of new "uneducated" crypto investors. I think it's great they show market sentiment by also post opinions but not as headlines as many sites do.

This could be the start of a new phase, when governments start recognise blockchain data as legally binding, overall global intrest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies will rise rapidly.
