You didn't answer which professor.
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:55:48
Not that I am judging, but you not giving a name and a professor trying to teach importance of blockchain tech by talking about failed forks and bitcoin cash specifically (which did not fail) in that list is very off character for an academic, it has no value for an introduction class and it makes me believe you are just circle jerking for karma with an agenda. (FYI I currently do not hold BCH, I hold btc, eth and omg.)

Hey jupocoin, I read the thread but apparently i did not update it. I actually had my money credited but if i did not pursue it, it would be lost. So here is what happened for me: 
Finally i got my money but it's because me and my brother started to dig on our own and we found an interesting problem that probably a lot of people encounter without knowing. Apparently BTC-e works with an intermediary finance service called Mayzus. So when somebody wires money to BTC-e it goes to Mayzus and they pay to BTC-e. Also when you send money in USD, every wire transfer has to go over an American bank, no matter what the sending and receiving banks are. So what happened is we sent the money with **proper details that BTC-e provided** but while passing through the American New York Bank,they have lost the details (erased or just forgot to add) and deposited to Mayzus without details. Those details link that money to my account. Then Mayzus forwarded the money to BTC-e but they could not know who it was meant for. Money has reached BTC-e but it was just sitting there. We all learned this how? We called Mayzus headquarters and got to helpdesk and they provided all the info. We just sent a document of transaction to them and they fixed it. I am very grateful to that company.

The point is, you are trying to convince other people based on a rule that you made up about a "minimum transfer of value" which does not exist in this network. If a transaction fits all the network rules and gets included in a block, that's it. it means it is legitimate and legal.

How do you think Vitalik frauds people? Can you elaborate on one of his scams?
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:04:03
The problem with your analogy is that cars or software like windows are not invented, they are collaborative products which are based on thousands of inventions. On the other hand, proof of work is a single method that is invented, which has no purpose on its own unless it is used for a product which is in this case mining for bitcoins. 
I agree with your comment that Adam might not be grasping completely for what purpose it was used in bitcoin mining or what were the initial intentions, but no one can claim that he does not know what he "work" is on proof of work because that part is not specific for bitcoin and it is exactly what he worked on for years for hascash.

Wow, I can not read it without cringing. Such embarassement...
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:45:03
Spam or not, that is a valid unit test about what happens when there is too much transactions at a small amount of time.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:24:32
There was a spam attack just a few days ago where BTC confirmation times rose to hours while BCC cleared the whole backlog in 1 block of 40000 transactions. I don't endorse BCC for other reasons but handling congestion better is a proven fact.

No worries, it is a Turkish exchange called Koinim.com. Very low volume and only local.

The problem is, it is not a bunch of people. Literally all the USDT created at Bitfinex was used to lending for margin trading, mostly to long the BTC. There will be a long and big reversal to altcoins now, I literally do not understand what is the moon talk here.

Thanks! Will look into this.

I tried to and still am trying to convince them. But from the answers I get they do not know what they are doing. I am in for a trouble...
an edit : Maybe there is something I do not know here... I am the receiver. The btcs are sent from exchange to my own wallet. But since they are not confirmed yet I do not see them in my balance. How can I spend unconfirmed output?
@_date: 2017-04-06 17:51:07
Can you elaborate on how you can spend the money which is not confirmed by the miners yet? I sent 4 btc from an exchange to my wallet but it got stuck due to low fees for 2 days. As I am not the owner of the exchange wallet I can not do anything but since the tx is not confirmed yet I have nothing in my wallet as well. How can I do what you describe?
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:34:18
Why are you explaining, they are just parroting a phrase they read without thinking.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:13:17
You are using centralisation in completely wrong terms. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both decentralised networks and actually Ethereum is more decentralised as it is cheaper to start mining. If you want to have a fork of etheruem you need more nodes to come to agreement than you would need when same thing happens at Bitcoin. What is different is that Ethereum has a more steady and generally respected development team, which makes it easier to come to agreement. It does not mean that miners are spineless and do whatever is said by Vitalik.

1000 BTC in an obscure indian exchange causing a worlwide crash? Are you serious?
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:46:43
Our difference come from our approaches at times of crisis. I find network rollback acceptable when implications are too grave to endanger the network itself. You don't. I respect your opinion.
I also agree with the javascript part. Maybe in future a different smart contract platform with a better language will topple Ethereum. I have no special attachments to Ether except I believe it, for now, more than the competition.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:09:50
My wording is a little of but blocksize limit + speed are together making the limits of a network and since litecoin has 4 times faster block discovery, it makes it 4 times as capable. If bitcoin increases the size to 2mb, this ratio will become 2 instead of 4.
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:37:11
Currently since Segwit has been activated at BTC as well, the biggest advantage of Litecoin over Bitcoin is ~~not having the blocksize limit at 1mb and having faster block time~~  having 4 times more capacity thanks to faster block time. Personally for me Segwit2X threatens the role of LTC as faster sister coin for daily transactions as it get Bitcoin capacity closer.
As a side note, how can you foresee the price effect of Segwit2X on Litecoin? You should be careful when you make certain predictions like this, people look up to you and they might be guided falsely. 
Still, good job with LTC. Keep on rocking.

How can insolvency of tether can be price din without all tether holders getting out or broke?
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:01:01
Ethereum has far more pressing scaling issues because far more transactions are done on it due to smart contracts and dapps. Implement same systems on Bitcoin and you will have same problem at Bitcoin. So the scaling comparison between Ethereum and BTC makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-09-07 07:42:38
ETH rolled back a huge hack that had a potential to devastate the economics of the network, threatening the very existence of the whole ethereum project. If the network was not rolled back, the hacker would control 1/20th of the market cap as of now with 3.6 million ethers, all liquid and dumpable. We would not even be at this point as people and organizations would not invest in a network where price will never be safe/stable due to a hacker controlling the biggest centralized money stack.
The same thing actually happened at BTC as well when a hacker used a bug to create 90 million BTC suddenly which was accepted by the network at 2010. The EXACT same recovery method was used and the network was rolled back to a previous block, rendering all the other transactions that happened as well non existing. How is that for immutability?
Both these cases had huge implications for the sanity of the networks which were at their infancies. Today, if such a hack happens 2 things are very obvious:
*  The size of a possible hack has a very high chance of being much smaller compared to market cap, as the networks are not new anymore and and coin value/distribution has changed dramatically. If same DAO hack would happen today, it would amount to a much much less number of ether coins, making it completely acceptable for the network health.
* The number of miners and pools and nodes have increased dramatically since then and reaching a consensus is not as easy as was before. The network is not owned by devs.
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:00:46
I understand your point of view completely but please realise that same argument is valid for the Bitcoin hack as well. For both of these cases, the vulnerabilities hackers exploited were unintended/missed code vulnerabilities. They were not the intended design. DAO surely said code was law but they sure as hack did not think they had such a grave exploit. 
As for DAO being a client, yes you are right. Ethereum was not hacked, it was just a smart contract. But it was literally the first big smart contract of possibly the biggest revolution we will see in our lifetime and that was literally the most vulnerable time for the network. At that time, at those circumstances Ethereum chose to break immutability because that was needed for network to basically exist and prosper. Now, the network is somuch bigger and seasoned that it is not needed nor it is even possible anymore.

There is no rollback button on any blockchain. What is referred is to just manually making arrangements in a way to take out confirmed transactions from history which is possible on any blockchain if miners and nodes agree to it.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:04:39
There is ABSOLUTELY no difference between how you can roll back ETH or BTC. The reason people are saying ETH can be rolled back because they say people will do what Vitalik says, which absolutely disregards the size of the community of ETH. Ethereum community having a so far positive figure at the head of development is not a disadvantage but people find ways to somehow shit on it. The same situation would be valid if bitcoin had a steady development team head but what bitcoin failed to do now is somehow hailed here. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:45:24
You are saying the same thing with u/stale2000. He also says if bitcoin core devs are threatening to leave let them do it as early as possible. Others will replace them and we will deal with effects sooner then later but unlike nullc believes bitcoin will not die, thinking that way is a little egoistic.
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:30:01
There is literally no argument behind it. If he ever answers your question, he will say because everyone listens to just one guy as if Vitalik did a magic hypnosis on the whole network participants to keep his effect until eternity. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:17:19
Why are you skipping the part where "community" implements it? Leadership only proposes a change, it is the community who accepts or not. In ether's case we've seen it. A part of community declined and went off to their own chain, free to develop and steer in any direction they want. Another part of community decided to stay with the original devs and that's the ether we have now.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:35:43
Bitcoin is in a long term down trend my friend. Other coins/solutions are taking over the crypto world. Do not play your pieces by just looking at history and believing blindly that it will somehow recover. Technically speaking bitcoin has only the network effect on its side and on every other aspect it is beaten by other coins. This downspiral can be the one that also beats the network effect.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:19:46
Two clients which reject the blocks of each other is hard fork. BTC hard forked at that time, not soft forked.

Go out at your street and ask people you encounter if they know or ever used bitcoin. I do this regularly everywhere i can and the number of people who know is extremely rare, i am yet to see someone i asked randomly who has even tried using bitcoin for buying something. We are very early adopters.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:20:43
confirmed means backed by facts or proof, he just supplies his reasoning after saying confirmed, hence op is just shitposting.
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:12:39
What I mean is are there people who lost their money for good during deposit or did it eventually turn out after weeks/months?
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:33:47
Another question is, let's say that I have a business and I want to use Bitcoin as a payment system. Should I calculate the fees all the time myself or do the wallet services automatically calculate the best fees for me?
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:37:21
Thank you for this response, it kinda eases the fear. I think i have to wait more to have a better opinion.
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:30:31
that is true, ltc/btc parity has been on a fall since april but that is exactly why buying ltc is a good deal now. 0.013 parity is gonna go up to 0.05-0.06 levels in few months with the adoption of ltc by more exchanges (mainly china). That way i can quadruple the amount of btc I can normally buy with the same base money. That, if i can deposit my money safely ofcourse.
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:18:08
I actually have always seen bitstamp and coinbase as real exchanger sites but I was using Btc-E only because of litecoin market. I wanted to buy ltc directly before converting to btc so I took the risk and deposited directly to Btc-e. I guess I have no option but to wait it out. Thank you for your response.
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:21:14
If by OP you mean me, i really have no agenda. I buy litecoins as much as I buy bitcoins and other altcoins. That is actually exactly why I use BTC-e since it has the broadest exchange possibilities. The problem here though is not coin specific, it is exchange spesific. If BTC-e steals or loses my money it doesn't matter what  currency you use. That's why I am concerned right now to hear that withdrawals are not working, either on 1 coin or all of them.
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:12:27
I have sent 5k dollars fiat money with SEPA 20 days ago and there is nothing showed up yet. I have no answers to my tickets and what is worse... I have 40k sitting in my account, if withdrawals are closed and they run off with money i am doomed.
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:51:48
I read many threads and comments about BTc-e either here or other forums and I had the general idea that it was more trusted than mt-gox deposit and withdrawal wise. I know I may have been wrong but I did it and now it is more important to know if there is something i can do.
