Anyone have any idea the last time 24 hour volumes were this low?  This is crazy. I guess weve all decided to stop buying or selling.

Or the loss people could take.  When the price was going up, even people in my social feeds were talking about btc and alts.  Now no one talks about it.  The fall from grace really fucked us when it comes to public interest.  Alot of people lost their ass.

Price seems to go up when volume is low lately.

Well, reckon I should have sold at 9900, damn vacations.  With that said, I refuse to sell until it's atleast back at 9k.  To all of you other folks panic selling, have fun taking the losses.
Edit: for those of you HOPING that bitcoin crashes, you're working against bitcoin.  You wont see adoption from businesses until it's somewhat stable.  As a business owner, drops like these hurt pretty badly if I'm not exchanging for fiat on a regular basis.

Just recently actually. Normally huge price swings in either direction involved large volumes.  But just watching bitstamp, all of the upward movement the last month or so has been when 24h volume is under 10k btc.

I got lucky and bought two at 750 each before prices went crazy.  The sad thing is, I've never use them or my threadripper to mine anything.

I honestly hate it.  I used to be an AMD fanboy, went to Intel because it made sense and came back to AMD for the TR and wish I would have done an I9 build instead.  The memory controller for the TR and its chipset is garbage.

Money is a tool. If you use it any other way, you're already losing no matter how much you have.
