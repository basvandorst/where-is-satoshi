So I just wait 2 weeks until I get my kfc?

I bought at 1000 and it got down to 300, but I was still holding. Then I got hacked. I will 100% kill me because of this, maybe I stream it.

Your mom thought a woman invented Bitcoin? Is she retarded?

Haha wow, I am almost 100% sure my brother will write the same thing on here after I do the same. 
For months there is just Bitcoin in my mind, and how I lost it, and I am probably doing the same. 
I didn't even loose it because I sold but because somehow I got hacked.

Haha i hang myself. Got depression, endet up in the hospital, lost 1.4 bitcoins, now have to pay 14k for the hospital.
I would have 11k now, at least i could pay most of the bill, but nope, i don't have it anymore.

I lost 1.4 bitcoins a few months ago, don't know exactly how. 
I wanted to hold but nope... 
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:53:54
And you think Bitcoin is just like that? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:12:46
We could all sell, cause a chain reaction, and when it's at 4000 we buy again. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:48:37
I can't. Have no liquid money right now, and no 6 k to just buy it back 
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:15:37
Then I just kill myself when it reaches 20k 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:27:42
And I lost 1.4 bitcoins. I seriously think about killing myself. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:57:12
I lost 5k worth of Bitcoin, yolo.
