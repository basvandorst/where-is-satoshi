I think what you are looking for would be some bitcoins that were purchased at around $2 and then not moved (ie, stored in an offline wallet or paper wallet).  That way when you use them to purchase something you can pay taxes on almost every bit of their current value! (assuming you are in US)

I've never had a problem with MtGox... bitcoin / USD in / out without a problem (via Dwolla, so you have to give it a few days for the USD to move around).  Of course, you will need to submit the verification docs, but that only took 2 - 3 days as promised.

Bitfloor was 'hacked' and 25k BTC was taken.  Supposedly the people who had BTC in there are still waiting to get compensated.
If I recall correctly, the owner of the site had an unencrypted backup of a wallet stored somewhere, and someone got access to it and drained it.
Sorry if the details aren't exactly correct, but this is what I recall...
@_date: 2013-01-15 17:36:48
It is a fun site.  It also has a sidebar with chat where you can interact with others.  I hope the site does well and the owner seems like a nice guy!
@_date: 2013-03-15 22:39:23
Don't try to time the market!  If you are ready to buy and are set up at MtGox then buy small amounts over the course of several days or weeks (aka 'Dollar Cost Averaging'). The fee is just .6% each transaction no matter the size... Heck, buy in .01 BTC increments if you like! 
If you are using Coinbase you will pay 1% plus 15 cents per transaction.  MtGox is cheaper, but might take you a lot longer to get set up.
Buying over time will get you invested and you won't feel like a total loser if the price drops 20% the next day.  In fact it should make you smile!
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:54:35
Whenever a method to acquire bitcoins goes down or takes a break, I always suggest people look at

The most reliable way to buy bitcoin with credit card is through virwox.com.  You will need to fund your account, then purchase Linden$ (SLL) and then exchange those for BTC.  It will end up costing you at least 10% over the market price and is a pain.  Plus new accounts will have a delay on withdrawing your bitcoin.  But if you really want to use credit cards you are going to end up paying extra and jumping through some hoops.
On another note, some localbitcoins.com sellers might accept credit cards for an in-person exchange, as long as you are willing to show id, etc.
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:19:19

The blockchain.info app makes using bitcoin on the web super easy.  If you want to send BTC just show it the qr code and send away! (don't even need to enter a password/phrase since it launches ready to roll ** that said, make sure your phone is secure and don't lose it to someone who knows what bitcoin is.)
Oh, and if a site doesn't provide a qr code address, just copy and paste it to this URL in another tab:   (replace 'TheAddressHere' with whatever you want to be in the qr code).
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:14:00

Yes, any gambling site is a good candidate to get co-workers interested in bitcoin. I like bitcoinvideopoker because the chips show up pretty much instantly.

If you ever import an insecure private key into your blockchain.info wallet (or any wallet!) you should make sure you archive/purge/hide it after sweeping the value from it to make sure you can never use it again, or that it accidentally ends up as a 'change' address.

A Bitcoin ATM should be developed so that anyone could build one.  From what we have seen it can be done with some pretty basic hardware (Raspberry Pi, bill collector, camera, etc).  And when it gets featured in MAKE magazine everyone will have a Bitcoin ATM in their garage (or living room).

Was this your first time using btc-e? and the guy in China? I always like testing a new service with the equivalant value of a nice car...
@_date: 2013-03-11 18:19:50
If you are in Los Angeles, try DoctorBTC on 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:36:10
Yes. I'll gladly purchase a "5 satoshi footlong"... Actually, i'll pay whatever $5/{bitstamp-last} is for that day. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:01:19
 - you can probably arrange to buy some later today.
@_date: 2013-06-11 13:25:34
Hello!  What are the coords?
@_date: 2013-01-11 20:24:21
so, are there always 100 keys 'standing by' in your wallet.dat?  Or do you have to use up the 100 before any new keys are generated?
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:17:43
If your house got broken into that night and the robbers didn't know it was there, then it would have been a pretty good investment to leave it on the windowsill!
@_date: 2013-03-18 19:01:18
You are going to need a person to help you with this.  What part of the country are you in?
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:15:21
On another note, I use gliph and think it is really cool!  Everyone should start using it no matter what! It brings GPG/PGP style encryption to the masses in a user-friendly format (chat/im) that people are used to.
@_date: 2013-04-01 17:34:39
Yeah, what's that all about?
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:27:28
Of course it is illegal to try and circumvent encryption, right?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:34:03
Probably both! Ever since the chart went vertical I've stopped thinking about what Bitcoin means... so having the exchange rate drop reminded me why I am so fascinated by it.
@_date: 2013-03-02 22:14:26
The site explains the process, but basically you hand over cash once the seller provides you with a code that is proof that the btc have been successfully transferred to your account.
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:50:45
Sort of like that annoying toll-lane on the highway that adjusts the price based on demand, if the clients were able to keep updated on the current confirmation times and fees, you could have an option to adjust your fee depending on your need.
@_date: 2013-10-10 22:33:53
More reason to get familiar with 
In-person cash exchange, off blockchain, a lot of sellers with more joining every day.
@_date: 2013-10-07 23:55:43
Purchase in chunks with cash in person via localbitcoins:
I bet you will find helpful sellers willing to answer any questions about safely storing and securing your new btc.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:04:49
 - Your local bitcoin representative will be glad to assist you.  The small premium you will pay will be worth the conversation that you can have in real-time.  Just look for the person with the most transaction history and positive feedback.
@_date: 2013-02-27 17:14:58
 and someone with a Square card swiper might do it...
@_date: 2013-11-01 16:42:21
i vote %25 off... i've often put things in my card and then decided "eh... i'll make my own"
@_date: 2013-03-06 01:02:36
I see an arbitrage opportunity!
@_date: 2013-02-21 22:16:11
It's got real BTC enabled now...
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:04:53
wait, I thought 'accept' meant to accept the refund!
@_date: 2013-02-13 17:01:52
"anon_bitcoin_gambler" --- Your name says it all!  'Investing' borrowed money in anything where you don't have a say in the outcome is pretty much gambling.  If you were starting a business with that money it could be called something different, I suppose.
@_date: 2013-02-21 23:38:39
What are the fees?  There is no info or link anywhere on the site.  Did the designers leave that off on purpose?
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:37:14
More business for localbitcoins.com dealers...
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:22:56
... down the hall.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:49:02
If you love the idea, then buy the dollar amount you are comfortable with.  What does it matter if the price of 1.00000000 BTC == $10 / $100 / $1000?
I really don't understand people who look think something is cheap or expensive based on the 'per share price' (I know, bitcoin is not a stock, but this seems like the same phenomenon).
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:36:49
Odd, all the email communication i did today shows &lt;[email hidden]&gt;... so is this still happening?
@_date: 2013-03-18 18:44:32
Perhaps we need to start using the term "Saint Gavin"?
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:24:41
Seen no problem printing to most printers from Ubuntu 12.04LTS live cd...
@_date: 2013-01-17 22:39:31
Unfortunately, it doesn't take into account the need for instant gratification!
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:39:17
Start a newsletter so we can make our decisions the opposite of yours... 90% reliability is great!
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:09:54
 Cash in-person exchange **1%-50%(?)**  (1hr - ?)
@_date: 2013-09-23 02:11:23
Lame. Site just wants your email address.
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:19:11
BFL are genius!  By raising the price and reducing efficiency on their 'current' products they made everyone who ordered earlier feel like they are getting more for their money... but they didn't even have to give anything to those people!  And they might never... but whatever.
@_date: 2013-09-23 17:42:15
You could install gli.ph and connect it to your coinbase account, and now your bc.i wallet (so I heard, haven't tried)
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:10:34
Average in... once your $300 arrives, just purchase $30 worth at the market price, every day, for 10 days.  If it rises everyday then you win! (your bitcoins are worth more than you paid) 
 If it goes down every day (but you think it will rise in future) you win! (because you will own more than having bought all at once)
If it goes down and dies, well at least you were there for the historic ride!
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:58:55
@_date: 2013-07-15 19:01:44
That thing is cool. Cheaper than getting a custom 'BITCOIN' license plate...
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:50:42
Weekly purchase FTW! Great idea to take a hands-off approach to buying bitcoin.  Just set it and forget it... don't try and time the market.!
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:28:51
Your fiat gains are almost risk free., but if you want to capitalize on the rise then you wouldn't be doing the arbitrage, I hope.
@_date: 2013-02-28 20:36:28
From Dwolla, you can initiate a recurring transfer that goes straight to MtGox.  Just set up a daily or weekly amount and have it automatically show up in MtGox.  If you don't like the price when it arrives let your $ sit until you likey.  Unfortunately, don't know how long this easy ride will last once MtGox is split up...
@_date: 2013-06-19 17:06:22
Thanks for the price formula information.  Way better than what they provide on the site!
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:23:03
It means more new customers for 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:36:05
Yes, via   Just be prepared to jump through some hoops.
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:30:57
I see a business here.  I'd sell that bet if there were any takers ;)
@_date: 2013-02-22 19:36:26
Use blockchain.info app.  Customer gives you cash plus QR code and you scan and send.  Keep your mobile device in your locked pocket (hey, anyone make armored pants?)  If they want to hang out while it confirms, sell them something while they wait!  
...and if you're in Noho, just call the doctor ;)
@_date: 2013-01-15 18:07:57
Maybe stupid question, but if you verified with Dwolla and MtGox, why don't you transfer directly between them?  Or is it that 'seasonin'' thing that you have to wait for a few months?
@_date: 2013-09-16 12:30:15
Coinbase weekly recurring purchase. Whatever amount you want. Set it and forget it. This is one of the best ways to invest and can be considered one way of "paying yourself first" before you spend all your money on stuff that you don't/won't need.
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:25:32
Good thing we always access this internet thingy through a VPN!
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:26:00
*  to see what Bitcoin is.
*  to buy some from someone in your community.  I'm sure they will spend some time answering any questions you have.
*  -  meet some nice people who play poker.
@_date: 2013-03-06 00:59:57
 may launch as a way for businesses to advertise by sponsoring hidden treasures. They put up the BTC bounty and the site will organize the 'cache' location, clues, etc.  Potential for ARG development as well!
@_date: 2013-07-12 22:56:29
where do I send my bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-03-07 22:41:03
*Step 1: Visit 
*Step 2: create a login / password (no email, id, passport, or fingerprint necessary)
*Step 3: deposit Bitcoin
*Step 4: play poker!
All this should take about 11 minutes (1 minute to register and send Bitcoin, 10 minutes for your deposit to confirm)
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:23:53
Their rental properties include free electricity (wink, wink).
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:03:50
If you set up your account with GA and Yubikey, you can use either one to login, withdraw, etc.  If you misplace one, you can use the other...
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:37:18
Localbitcoins.com is a great service... nice to meet bitcoin followers afk!  I wish more people would be hitting me up in Los Angeles!
@_date: 2013-02-25 22:21:30
Look for some used Bitcoins on craigslist?
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:35:44
It is like swimming... you can read and study all you want, but until you jump in you don't really know what it is like. Start small, practice using Bitcoin, securing it, sharing it and dealing with it (and even make mistakes with it). Once you get a feel for things, then you can decide if you want to deal with more.
@_date: 2013-03-07 19:01:53
I would say that MtGox might be better for holding since you can set up 2-factor authentication via YubiKey or Google Auth.  Of course this all depends on the security of each site. If either were hacked or robbed to the degree that they had to close up shop and couldn't settle with their customers you would suffer a loss.  You should research what might be the best way for you to hold your coins in your own possesion and not trust them to anyone!  Some people like paper wallets like from bitaddress.org or a brainwallet.
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:15:59
"It’s also available to retail Bitcoin investors in all markets except the U.S."
Sad face :(
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:03:52
Upon confirmation, it appears your order returns to *'processing'*.
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:55:23
Many sellers on localbitcoins accept SEPA transfer around Bitstamp rate: 
Just make sure you start out with someone who has 100+ trades and 100% feedback. You don't want your first experience there to be a negative one.
@_date: 2013-02-13 18:30:12
I think it is a requirement that if you like Bitcoin, you need to purchase a pair of Alpaca Socks...
PS, they make great gifts!  (hint, hint)
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:02:36
MIsleading title, right?  It would be dishonest if they didn't put those fees, costs, etc. into writing. amirite?
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:47:04
@_date: 2013-02-20 22:43:21
That actually is not very comforting.  Transactions disappearing, then completing?  You had to initiate to resolve?  Not ready for primetime!
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:53:38
MtGox is like going to the orchard to pick your own apples.  Coinbase is like ordering your fruit online and waiting for it to arrive in the mail.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:39:40
Yes, the bounty for them is pretty high...
@_date: 2013-03-07 19:09:25
An offline wallet does not protect against a collision, it just means that when you go bring it 'online' you will discover that the funds have been spent!  Splitting your funds among different addresses will actually make it easier for a collision!  ie... 50% chance to find one collision would be doubled if you had funds in 2 addresses, right?  Of course you would be cutting your losses when the collision did occur.  Why am I even considering this?  2.2 x 10^19 !!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:31:01
Umm...  did you test this out with a smaller amount first?  Nothing makes you sweat more than dropping a large chunk of change (sorry, $1300 is large to me) and hoping everything goes smooth.
My Advice:  Always try things with small amounts before you go for the large amounts.
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:56:35
I've tried several sites, but for quick fun without need to register:
(yes, it is my referral link)
I've never had any problem moving BTC in or out and the classic video poker machine is perfect.
I don't suggest SatoshiDice... a coin toss just isn't that exciting.
@_date: 2013-10-28 04:02:51
me too!
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:02:39
If you are an honest person, start using LocalBitcoins!  More honest people out there doing this will crowd out the dishonest.  Use common sense. Do small transactions until you feel comfortable. Try it.  You might even make some new friends with similar interests.
@_date: 2013-10-25 23:13:22
Thanks for the explanation and the reasoning behind it. I look forward to using your service.
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:50:29
this is also how email became so popular...
@_date: 2013-03-18 12:41:20
1. I wonder how secure that telephone call was where he read the key to his father...
2. Did he really just tell everyone he carries on his person an easily completed private key holding a nice chunk of Bitcoin? (where's that public address so I can check the balance...)
I hope he doesn't become a target for more crime.
Maybe it's no different than wearing a Rolex or driving a Ferrari?
@_date: 2013-06-07 21:37:18
Not my order, but interesting, no?
@_date: 2013-05-10 18:44:07
I believe you gotta practice and figure this stuff out before you go in like that!
@_date: 2013-07-16 23:04:43
... and if the trade gets cancelled, the seller simply chooses to cancel the transaction and the btc that were funding the trade get returned to him instantly.
@_date: 2013-10-09 18:16:22
Yes  is a way to add some anonymity to your purchases. However, in a cash exchange you are physically there... That is why you should always arrive to the exchange with a hat, dark sunglasses, and even a fake beard.  have fun with it!
@_date: 2013-06-19 17:08:38
@_date: 2013-09-24 04:04:55
Here's how it could have played out with Bitcoin as the hero...
You find a Bitcoin buyer via localbitcoins.com.  You fund the transaction with your bitcoins.  Your girlfriend meets the buyer in a public place. She has the guy show her or hand her the cash. You are on the phone with her and you release the bitcoins, telling your girlfriend the verification code to pass along to the buyer. The buyer knows he has received the bitcoins after hearing the code, and your girlfriend walks with the cash.
Bitcoin to the rescue!
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:57:19
I used it yesterday for the first time.  Cash into BofA on my lunch break, USD in my Bitfloor account when I got back to my desk.
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:31:50
Credit Unions rule! I've had my account for 25 years and never a negative experience. I don't know why anyone banks with a for-profit entity like BofA, Chase, etc.  I've had accounts with them and they do offer some better online services, but CUs are catching up. If you have $50k to leave in a bank, you get the good free stuff, otherwise I can't believe you would pay for their massive overhead... buildings &amp; real estate on every corner, zillion employees, fee to use some other ATM, and cash dividends to their shareholders!?
(rant over)

The QR Code scans to this address:
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:11:23
Jalapenos were the best play here... shipped before the faster machines allowing you to actually get some profit!
@_date: 2013-10-11 15:12:41
its called convenience. comes with risk.
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:30:13
So cute.  Almost worth it...
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:20:04
But the Bitcoin network appears to be working just fine.  I just paid someone .01 BTC and they got it no problemo.
@_date: 2013-07-16 23:03:29
My experience has been... say hi, feel awkward, chat about bitcoins.  then show him the cash.  he should feel comfortable releasing the btc at that point.  he will show you the code and you can hand him the cash. You also shouldn't feel bad about handing him the cash first, as long as he doesn't look like a runner... with smartphones and sms, you will probably be notified of the transfer before he turns his phone around to show you the code.
@_date: 2013-02-14 21:44:54
Just buy it.  Figure out what it does later!
@_date: 2013-02-22 19:05:30
Maybe old-timers are just moving from cold storage addys to online addys...
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:28:44
I've described it as "A global, decentralized currency that is not under the control of any government or country.  It was created by the people and it belongs to the people that hold it and use it.  These people ultimately determine it's value, not a central bank or politician"
@_date: 2013-08-15 18:03:59


Don't honest, hard-working citizens also value being allowed to operate in the shadows?
@_date: 2013-02-28 20:39:34
But that horse looked good 8 months ago!
@_date: 2013-09-10 22:09:57
My 10 year old plays minesweeper in the Bit Vegas... i guess that counts.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:34:08
Well, i snapped the photo, but I bet they could have designed the billboard in Photoshop.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:51:35
Because you have to price in the fact that Bitfloor could close their doors any minute, since they owe like 25k BTC to folks...
@_date: 2013-02-28 17:49:26
Aw our baby is all grown up!  (and about to get regulated?)
@_date: 2013-09-18 23:32:00
Don't exagerate. You can buy reddit gold, alpaca socks, tea, jewelery, baklava, etc. with BTC.... no need to turn it to fiat.
@_date: 2013-03-11 12:56:59
Very bullish, I'd say...
@_date: 2013-03-21 22:08:13
...except for the coal/gas used to produce the electricity.
@_date: 2013-02-13 00:30:56
Oh, that Yap stuff is great!
@_date: 2013-03-02 19:07:57
ohhh.... sort of like a gpg keyserver!  that would be cool, but not anonymous...
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:10:45
I think they provide a good service.  Not useful if you need to get your hands on bitcoin immediately, but if you don't mind waiting a week the do deliver as promised.
@_date: 2013-10-09 18:14:02
Buying bitcoins via localbitcoins is pretty anonymous...
The coins you get come from their pool of btc, so a direct link from buyer to seller doesn't exist.
@_date: 2013-10-21 17:08:59
Buy with cash from someone in your area: 
I recommend finding a seller with a good history and reputation. They will be glad to help you out.
@_date: 2013-07-24 00:30:47
Someone needs to webchat link to the Los Angeles event since it will be happening at the same time...
@_date: 2013-07-12 23:03:24
Wow.  Beautiful!
@_date: 2013-10-25 23:14:52
After you are on the forum page, try going back to the original url, and you should find yourself at the exchange...
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:30:28
Not today... their works appear to be all gummed up.

I had a similar problem with the wifi at work, but for some reason after 6 months the problem went away.. i think it was rebooting the airport base.
@_date: 2013-02-22 19:40:50
I've worked with people like this.  Even when the deadline is 5 minutes away and they have still have 2 hours of work to complete, they don't acknowledge that they are about to blow their deadline.
But didn't you feel good about how confident they were about the last estimate?
@_date: 2013-10-22 23:21:04
more robo, please!
@_date: 2013-03-27 01:02:01
Ohhh... great book! Perfect for those with interest in Bitcoin.  I'm going to have to read it again, now!

Blockchain.info wallet + Cash Deposit (Via BitInstant).  $3.95 + 3.9%
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:59:38
Some people want to make these local in-person transactions seem so shady. They aren't.  If you get a bad feeling about a situation then don't do it.  Email, text, chat with the person you are going to meet. People have to use their own judgement and take responsibility unless they'd rather have some gov't do that for them...
@_date: 2013-02-01 20:32:22


You can buy with credit card...
If you really want to use a credit card go to virwox.com, buy SLL, trade SLL for BTC.
But be prepared to pay extra and wait a while!
(so does this mean you are an idiot?)
