Is not a get rich quick thing and it carries significant risk. If you are really poor, but young, you should invest no more than 5-7% of your earning in crypto. If middle aged or old, fiat works decently for now.

It's a pump now, tomorrow it will be dumped.

There is no reason. This is called Arbitrage and people do it all the times in forex markets. With transaction times it does become a bit difficult for you to do it effectively.

It's a co-ordinated pump. It will be up and suddenly tomorrow all money will funnel to Bitcoin.

I think it's more philosophical in nature. While all HODLers will hold, rational people in the crypto space will tell you never to hold more than what you can afford to lose. 
Given today's gains, decide what can you afford to lose. 
As for the future - no one knows - Kay sera sera

Perfect. You got it.

Its actually a parody movie. More akin a Leslie Neilsen movie. Quite hilarious in context.

What about Ledger? Isn't it the same?

This stuff is of nightmares for me. I had it all
Divided up between a popular exchange and an electrum wallet on my home desktop. 
Now I have added a Knox enabled phone in to the mix and using Samsung blockchain keystore to store some as well. 
I think having 3 distinct places and ways to access it should enable me to minimize losses and be accessible.
Somehow hardware wallets seem very iffy. First of all, I don't think I can keep it up for the next 10 years. Second changing hardware softwares internet connectivity, Location - it's too much.
Secondly software is still good for the most part if you being smart. 
But I am still in search for a good solution - I don't know if there is a good answer yet.

Dude it's a stable coin like USDT.

You said it.

oh i already have some fractions already worth around 0.08 BTC. I made them after I mined some 30k dogecoins on my computer! This was all me playing games but i have never thought of it as a serious investment tool.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:21:01
I have to try atleast 4 times.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:43:50
Thanks for the tip. I will look in to it.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:48:29
I know its not a simple question - However, have you given it any thought? I tried to think about pro's and con's, analysed my fears of missing out but rationally my mind gravitates towards thinking that I should only be looking at short term and only play light in crypto eg: keep risk to less than few thousands of USD i.e. a fraction of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-02 19:38:58
Thanks for your answer. While I don't agree on all points I do see where you are going with it.
@_date: 2019-04-02 19:13:05
From a price speculation pov - you think people will want to buy when it's like 100,000? Or 1,000,000?
Don't see this happening with gold or real estate so I am curious.
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:43:44
never hope for that to happen, and trust me, systems, as faulty they are - work well for quite some time. But bitcoin is something else, a true world currency not governed by anyone. Imagine, that is truly something. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 21:37:09
What you saying is that there is still a chance! Woohoo babeee I am gonna be rich.
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:45:15
As much as I am a BTC bull, you should focus on day to day saving and creating a 3-6 month safety net in Fiat. You should set your self up for success first in your trade or employment. Think about buying BTC when you have more money to save and you want to plan around it.
@_date: 2018-07-04 15:01:14
where is the report. All hearsay. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:29:48
The bank also generates employment for 100000 people and sustains 2x more. That's a pretty good metric.
