All tax advice I have received has been contrary to your opinion.
At the time of realizing a gain, you convert to USD and pay taxes on the gains.

Always been that way.
There was some debate, and some accountants trying to pass it off as a "like-kind exchange" but the IRS has been pretty clear.
Anytime you realize a gain, you pay capital gains tax.

Chaos and game theory.
We do not know the odds at all.
Gambling is when you have less then 50% chance to win.
Bitcoin, at least heuristically shows a much higher win rate then 50%. 
It is not gambling.
Along the same lines, if you wrote a model of the NFL and were avle to successfully predict outcomes of games such that heuristics show you are winning greater then 50%, then I would argue you are also not gambling.
I attribute the terminology gambling as participating in an agreement where you have less then 50% chance to win, or no real idea on the success rate and invest out of ignorance.
If you.make an investment with an 80% chance of success, and lose it all you were not gambling. You took an educated risk, with a reasonable chance of success.

Maybe not this specific scenario but...
Cryotocurrencies will be exposed to survival of the fittest. Competitive advantage, in whatever form that is will win out.
It is possible, maybe likely that the most successful will not always be the most successful.
Theoretically, there is a limited amount of cimputung power. That computing power will be distributed amongst all various crypto networks.
When a split like BCC occurs, if no new hashrates are introduced then value siphoing off of the mainline will occur for all hashrates that abandon the mainline.

You need faith in the means of production of GPUs, electricity and software like operating systems and even mining algorithms and cryptography.
If the government controls those things, they control the cryptomarket indirectly.
A zero day exploit in popular OS' would be able to wipe out the entire value of bitcoin overnight. A well-planned raid on mining operations could shutter doors and exponentially increase transaction times overnight.

You realize how much of a pansy this makes bitcoin look like right?
How is the world economy supposed to support a currency that is so fragile, that somebody can completely destroy it without even touching the code base.
Do you hear Microsoft cry each time that Apple releases a new product? 
The approach you are taking is literally the embodiment of the practices that we decided to rid ourselves of when we went into cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin is an objectively inferior code base at the moment. The emergency difficulty adjustment is an innovation, not an attack.
Bitcoin is killing itself by not being able to adapt and provide what the market requires.
Bitcoin is overwhelmingly used as a value store and not as a currency. With the current tx fees and laggy delivery, it is the branch that has been rendered useless.
Bitcoin cash was created to solve the issues that the mainline has failed to address.
If this is really how the mainline community wants to handle it, then I guess I'll see you at your funeral. 
You need to compete, and right now Bitcoin itself is relying unilaterally on FUD and reputation to survive.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:35:35
Did it cost you $4 to send the $5 with the current tx fees?
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:07:07
Im not making a prediction.
I am just saying we dont know which cryptocurrency will be the big dog.
Its completely possible that there is a flippening.
Just because "bitcoin" has the name does not mean it will always have the same advantage.
Cryptocurrency will not survive on tribalism. It needs to provide the best objective product (s) to satisfy market needs.
Bitcoin might adapt to those market needs. Or, some altcoin will.
"Bitcoin" is not as important the blockchain and blockchain like technologies (like TANGLE).
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:49:55
There will be offcoins, hard-forks, and alternatives.
Bitcoin itself may and can be redefined based on the consensus. 
If miners believe that they need to introduce more then the 21M currency, and they can form a consensus among themselves then that will be the new Bitcoin.
It's already been a risk with BCH and the flippening with ETH.
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:11:43
A type of non fiat currency that uses computing power as its basis for value, rather then GDP or gold.
After that, explain that it is decentralized, meaning no central authorities or corruption.
Then finally, explain that anybody can participate as an investor, or as a miner contributing their PC power. You get rewarded with transaction fees for helping the network, abd ultimately where bitcoins come from... helping.

Here is how to excercise my point w.r.t circular logic.
If gold lost all monetary value, what would it be useful for? Jewelry, dental implants, status symbol and electronics give gold real value.
What if Ethereum (a utility token) lost all monetary value? It would still be useful because the Ethereum network allows for the storage of and reception of data, and the ability to acquire CPU time to run your own applications (think SaaS/Cloud techbologies).
If bitcoin loses its monetary value, what is it good for? Absolutely nothing because nobody is interested in storing or tranafering value using a token that is now valueless.
Mastercard gets around this and provides actual intrinsic value because they do not use a MasterCardCoin. They instead depend on fiat to be the store of value. Their business model is not a catch 22 like bitcoin is.
Im not ignoring anything. I am curting through the logical fallacies and circular reasoning thag seems to run this fools playground.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:01:22
More centralization...
Its clear to me that BTC architecture is so inferior that it cannot scale without huge concessions.
A fork isnt enough, you need the entire thing rearchicted.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:41:18
Im of the opinion the entire BTC codebase is inferior architecture and value center based on circular logic.
BTC was a prototype for Nokamoto concensus and magic number mining. It is a great idea, but the implementation is inferior.
1 of the many altcoins will rise from the ashes of the BTC collapse.

Off-chain payment channels are the definition of centralization.
Any operation that doesn't occur on the blockchain is centralization.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:27:49
Blockchain is a data structure.
Whatever algorithms you execute on top of a data structure are not part of that data structure.
Concensus and mining are algorithms that do not depend on the blockchain to operate.
The idea of an "open ledger" that is secure is not "blockchain".
Blockchain is a distributed linked list, and supports operations that linked lists support (as opposed to operatiins that other data structures like graphs provide, mainly DFS, BFS, visitor pattern, etc...)
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:13:41
Actually, you can have a DLT that is constantly spammed.
Its called IOTA, runs on a DAG and is infinitely scalable.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:59:19
So Inception lightning networks aren't decentralized? Lightning networks are off-chain centralization.
While in the processes defined off-chain, you are susceptible to fraud and misuse. The resultant Tx posted to the blockchain will contain that transitive fraud.
You are introducing a new attack vector to bitcoin with this.
Especially if user behavior is to not use the blockchain directly and start relying on these side channels. You will lose basically all the security by creating these "endpoints" that are susceptible to fraud.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:03:53
I understand that there has never been an asset who's primary function is store of value.
All assets have a function which provide it's value center. Scarcity, dependability, and demand are multipliers of value, not value centers.
Saying something has "value" because it is a "value store" is nothing more then circular logic.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:54:10
Bitcoin is greater fool theory in action.
Bitcoin has no value center, and any intrinsic value pegged unto it is some form of circular logic. (ie: "It's a store of value", but doesn't it need value first before it can be a store of value?)
Once the investment community becomes educated, the greater fool theory will play out, fools will lose their money and the best technology that has actual value centers will rise from the ashes.

If they get rid of exchanges, it will only expedite the 0x platform.
If china regulates it, prices will go up as people gain confidence and buy back in.
If china bans it, it will still have demand and will become scarcer. Prices will go up as people realize they have alternatives in the 0x platform.
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:32:44
Can you find an example of this occuring in the past?
How do you protect against this? Does the btc chain need to be patched? Does the new branch need a software change?
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:10:50
Please explain how bitcoin is technologically superior to Ethereum?
All bitcoin has going for it, is being first.
Technologically speaking, Ethereum solves real world problems, including the same problem that bitcoin solves.
Bitcoin solves that single problem, and then basically packs up their bags are pretend to be "gold".
Bitcoin will never be gold. 
Ethereum will be Cloud v2.0, stealing $3 Trillion in market cap.
Bitcoin is a mastercard replacement, with a sane valuation of $30B market cap, which is already doubled.
Expect a huge drop in Bitcoin once people realize its already double the market cap of a sane technology valuation.

Not only that, but some random guy took time out of his day to try to talk to me about it.
Maybe the next time he runs into bitcoin he will take it more seriously.
And for the 1% that do begin to accept it... they might be the next time the other business owners in the area run into it.

@_date: 2017-10-03 23:32:59
I concede bitcoin is currently the leader. What is currently the case, is not always so.
That is quite literally the definition of innovation. Something that changes the status quo.
Blockchain ledgers are bulky and unoptimized although you are right, it has a proven security track record.
However, the entire crypto market is speculatory with no real products being shipped yet.
 Bitcoin itself gets most of its traffic through investing, and not as a day to day currency.
IMO, there is going to be a lot of movement in the space once real products, solving real problems, and earning real profits hits the market.
I am interested in IOTA and Ethereum as they provides a ton of advantages over traditional blockchain technologies.
IOTAs biggest knock is that it utilizes a COO node, while the network grows to critical mass at which point it disapears.
Thats a risk that I am willing to take after reviewing the technology and actually writing some code against it.

Yes, Ive realized this now.
I also had a friend tell me that having a single private key cant be trusted, and he wants F2A, usernames and passwords for all wallets.
I had the face palm, and then explain basic information security and how very large numbers work (60+ digits) versus small numbers (16 digits).
He is a cisco certified network engineer, but doesnt havr a grasp on a lot of nuances.
If you understand these things, there is a reason you are an early adopter of crypto.
Not everybody can, or should be. If somebody is investing without this knowledge they ate investing purely in FOMO and chasing money.
The fact that I see so many tech savvy people not understand tells me we still havr a distance to go.
