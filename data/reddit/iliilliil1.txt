It funny to see for me how defensive Americans get when they're told how much garbage and waste they produce. They're leading in the race for the exploitation of the planet and even Redditors fail to acknowledge it.
While most of the planet suffers from famine and lack of drinking water, Americans stuff their bellies so full that they destroy their health by overeating. And they even think of obese people as victims who can't help themselves. It's mind blowing for me that obesity is considered a disease in America. As if the poor guys were born with a disability that makes them unable ***not*** eat.
It's such a strong contrast between the average american and the average earthean, that grotesque is the only word to describe it, just like you said.

There is no need to package all of it. Only the small "installer" needs to be deployed and that takes care of everything in the background.

For better or worse these are the people that will use bitcoin. If anything, it shows that bitcoin is hard to get even for tech savvy people. Enthusiasm is high for the future of bitcoin, but these kind of things show clearly that the world isn't quite ready for a completely digital distributed currency.

I an extremely obvious joke for everyone that has ever came into contact with American media. "Terrorist" was the latest buzzword for limiting the rights of Americans for the last 10 years. Do you live under a rock?
PS: I live in Europe 8.000 km away from the US.

Gambling by definition is wagering money on an event that can have different outcomes. Some events are purely luck based, some are not. Only gambling on luck is stupid.

That increase in hashing power is seriously incredible. The last time I looked at the graph was about 5-6 moths ago but from then it just shot for the sky. I was expecting an increase considering all the mining gear developed for the purpose, but I'm still impressed.
I can now better relate to the frustration of the people who receive the mining gear with a 6 months delay. Talk about fraud.

I don't use Google for searches and haven't done so for the last 5 years. I still get the same search suggestions as OP.

I trust in math because I can verify the claims.
I can't verify what these people are telling me, why would I trust them? "We are good guys, cross my heart." I get that some people feel good when they can show off shiny stuff to their friends. If that makes them happy, good for them.
The whole essence of bitcoins is that you don't have to trust anyone. If only you know the private key, there's nothing anyone can do to screw you over.

You don't like to have a lot money or what? If money is bugging you, just give me a few millions, I'll take care of it for you.

So basically negligible compared to the amount Windows takes up on its own. I turned off all non-necessary Windows features and services, and 90% of the software I use require no installing (120+ programs I keep on a separate partition) and still my Windows directory is over 20 GB + Program Files is 7+ GB. You can hide an extra 400 Mb without any issues.

If your private key gets in the wrong hands, your money is bye bye. The last two are **especially** applicable because of this.
The first one is the only low risk danger, you backup your private key, and your bitcoins can't be lost.

You overthink the whole thing.
I receive my salary in USD, but I live in Europe in a country where the national currency isn't the euro, so there are 3 currencies that govern my financial life, and figuring out what things cost is a lot easier than you painted it. You just get used to it. Seriously. It's such a small issue, that I consider it a non-issue.
There are far bigger hurdles for bitcoin to overcome.

I have a question too: how do you use these coins? You type in the private key you see on the hologram and make a wallet?

That's the Windows way. Linux choose a different route to security.
Also, educating users on security makes a huge difference, and the average Linux user is lot more tech savvy than the average Windows user.

By that logic better takeaway would be: sell only after it's worth 20 times more than what you spent on it. Do you see the flaw in it?

Does it matter how it sounds if it's false?
I mean, you can jump of the top of the Empire State building and fly. But technically only until the moment you hit the pavement.

The people who downvoted you need to realize that your money is only as safe as your private key which is an ordinary file on your computer. Windows has a proven track record of ignoring good security practices. If I had a file that was worth 50.000$, I would never open it from Windows ever.

Some of these are low traffic, but the discussions are a lot more personal than in the bigger ones.

I wonder what will respond to your question. You should also go ahead and ask on their view on pot.
