I would say Google Reader met that criteria.

I'm still reading through your pdf but great work. Have a coffee on me!

Thanks for putting this together and congrats on getting approved! I'm with everyone else and would love the chance to check out your work.

I can't speak with authority here but I wouldn't think it would be a huge amount based on the light chips I've heard referenced. I think its more about combining a 1000x lightweight processors to create a strong pool. If they can keep it negligible then most consumers won't pay attention if the price offered that much of a saving.

Have you tried ZapChain yet?

SMS is probably what allows them to verify you phone  Rather than texting you a verification code and you having to type it just recognises it. Contacts are used to send money to friends according to another thread I seen.

One reason would be that they should have a lower shelf price. I walk into Walmart and they have a $50 Keurig or a $75 model. Both models are nearly identical but the $50 version has the mining chip. As a consumer I can save 33% to adopt the new model while Keurig now maintains a stream of income as long as the machine stays in use.

Thank you! I love how the list is coming along.

Thank you I just added your account and was wondering if there is any way to get a hold of the Circle stickers the guys had on their laptops. Very cool!

What about the Mozilla Foundation?

There is if you're a believer the value of bitcoin will rise exponentially over the next few years. After the value was to stabilize you could then pivot to focus on other uses for the chips such as the ability to communicate value with other devices.

1000 bits - Welcome aboard! Hope this helps you get started playing around a bit more.

Of course! I love Fold and use it every time I visit Starbucks!


I love it! One of the better apps for bitcoin at the moment.


I mentioned this on ZapChain but I think additional $$$ amounts would be great. Something where I could by a $20 card for my whole group when I come in.


I think you guys are doing an excellent job of building trust so far between your posts here and on ZapChain. I think as more users try it out the word of mouth will spread quick!
Great work!

You can already do this with Purse.io...and get a discount to boot!

Sure he could if he had read Gavin and SN's correspondences prior to acting it out. The email that SN used has since been hacked and Craig could have easily studied up on SN writing styles and wording to make him appear as SN to Gavin.

Edited for decency.

So I just got back from Starbucks and it worked just as it should. I sent $4 via Coinbase to the site which made a barcode pop up. I simply scanned the barcode and everything processed as normal. Also after you pay you can send the change left over back to your Coinbase account. It was all instantaneous too!
Here's a picture of my receipt from the purchase.

I hadn't heard of this either but if its anything like Purse.io then I think it will work great. Starbucks is closed here now but I'll go tomorrow and try it out if I can get my car out of the snow.

And then I would obviously have to go on and mention Purse.io.
