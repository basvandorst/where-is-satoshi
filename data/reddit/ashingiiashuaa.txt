If not we all work for something like gold or Bitcoin and technically battery our labor for something other than fiat.  We're use it to buy things too. There's no way the government would allow this to happen.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:30:21
I think you're right that the Bitcoin brand has real value, but gold has a track record of being valued and desired since the beginning of recorded history.  That's as good a track record as any brand can have.
What makes people excited/nervous/skeptical of bitcoin is that its track record isn't much more than a few years.

This is a really good question.  One thing that would make everything fall into place would be if exchanges could buy tethers for less than $1 each from Tether Inc.  The exchanges could only buy as needed (or likely refund purchase price with a special contract).  Once the USDTs are given to the customers they are no longer a problem for the exchange.  Exchanges make their money skimming the trades. 
In fact, Tether's updated TOS would fit nicely with this model.  The part where it states only direct customers of tether can redeem tethers would allow exchanges to buy tethers for less than face value.  The exchanges make money marking up the tethers, and Tether Inc. makes money printing the tethers.

But deflation is just as bad, and so is vulnerability to people cornering the market and other shenanigans.  I don't like inflation or deflation, but if there is to be either I suppose the best case is that it's consistent, small, and relatively predictable.  With crypto and gold the beneficiaries of market manipulations are speculators, investors, and big "whale" players, with currency at least the beneficiary is the government and central banks.

Those can be two independent statements that need not destroy social standing:

We're probably a week out from $20k.

They don't want to crush it, they only care about ensuring they can monitor and control it.
Remember a few months ago when regulators and the governments started seriously looking at Bitcoin? They came out a few weeks later and said that it was legal and the government sound respect the rights of the users of this fledgling currency.  
When they said that, they were really saying that they were comfortable with their ability to monitor and control Bitcoin to allow it.  It's a public ledger. It shows the full history of every Satoshi. And the super-mysterious addresses are just account numbers that t they easily track by requiring exchanges to collect and report PID.
They aren't going to allow anything significant to develop that they can't monitor and control.
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:50:42

In most cases BTC transfers are more expensive than bank transfers.  Online billpay is free, ETF/ACH/Checks are free, Visa/MC is around 1%), ATMs are a couple of bucks, but foreign fees can usually be avoided.  Only bank wires are more expensive, averaging around $15.


ATM, credit card, debit card, and intra-bank account transactions are all virtually instantaneous.  ETF, ACH, Checks, and wires aren't, but in almost no case do those need to be.


Banks are regulated and insured.  Account holders aren't liable or exposed if a bank fails or loses money.  Hacks, scams, and mismanagement aren't a concerned for deposits in government regulated and insured accounts.


Publicity and root cause of bank losses aren't the problem of depositors when the bank is regulated and insured.  


There are at least half a dozen widely-used currencies that are stable.  Most first-world fiat currencies inflate at a low, even, predictable pace.  


It takes a huge player to manipulate a first-world fiat currency.  It's rare and relatively minor when it happens.
 


Hodling isn't good for currencies or the economies that use them.  As an investment hodling isn't bad, but crypto is a worse investment than a currency.


Wallets, passphrases, public keys, private keys, exchanges, forks, mining, etc.  And if you make a mistake all your money is irreversibly gone.  Forever.
For crypto to take off it has to offer a better alternative than fiat banking.  Not be "as good", but "better" - otherwise why change. In its current state it requires many compromises in exchange for a few features that nobody really cares about.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:14:30
When transactions are slow and expensive people say it's a good store of value.   When it's volatile and tanking people say it's not a store of value but a currency.
Honest question : I know it has some features that fiat doesn't have (trustless transactions, public ledger/blockchain), but what *problem* does it solve?
