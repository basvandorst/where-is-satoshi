What regulation exactly? Would you still need to have a bank account in the country you are physically present in to use Bitcoin??
@_date: 2016-04-26 10:10:57
For one thing, Steam recently instated new region policies, which means people who live in a different country to the location of their bank can no longer buy games (which is a bit absurd). Until now I was just relying on Humble Bundles.
@_date: 2016-04-25 23:42:50
As someone who lives in a different country to my bank, it's been difficult trying to buy games on Steam due to these new region rules. Eventually found a workaround using a VPN, but Bitcoin will be a lot easier.
@_date: 2016-04-26 08:26:54
So you still have to register a bank card to the account? Seems like this defeats the point of using Bitcoin.

No, definitely not. The number of people actively engaged in Bitcoin is miniscule compared to the number of WoW players. WoW is heavily advertised, and is one of the most popular video games worldwide. And if you asked the average person if they know what it is, I would comfortably bet on them being more likely to know what WoW is, even if they don't play it.

Mmm, not really. It's becoming a tiny bit more popular in the media now, but is still very niche, and still nowhere near popular enough that audiences would understand and enjoy an episode about it. Especially if they attempt to raise some moral issues about the subject.

Of course I don't deny that it's in the news. It doesn't mean that the majority of news readers have a clue what it actually is and what it means to them.

There are a lot of different kinds of crime in that list. Sure you can identify a few that UK appears to be worse in by about 1%, but that hardly makes up for the vast majority which are worse in the US. Especially more serious ones like gun crime and murder, and more specific examples like police brutality and school shootings.
I never claimed UK is 'peaceful', crime exists everywhere, but comparatively speaking it's a very safe country.

You're misusing the statistics. If US had 0.6% robbery victim rates, and the UK had 1.6%, then the different would be 1%. Saying 'twice as much' is just misleading media-speak, because going from 1% to 2% is completely different to going from 30% to 60%. What matters are the percentage point differences.

If your password is good enough, just store the dat file all over the place.

But I read other reports of people who never successfully got it unlocked, and had to create a new Google account.

At each step of the Blockchain, an address sends all its coins to another address, plus an additional address generally owned by the sender which is the change address.
The nano might be moving things about, especially if you create multiple change addresses, but in the blockchain you would see the original coins being moved from address to address. It is not possible for coins to appear in address B for instance, without having been sent there from some other address.
It is not possible to obfuscate away your identity just by creating lots of new addresses within the nano, because it is easy to read this part of the blockchain as a closed system whose total adds up to 100 (assuming 100 coins first entered the system from the exchange), and a simple algorithm could trace the origin back to the exchange pretty quickly.

Which person are you referring to? If they were to subpoena the information from the exchange then they would know which people withdrew money, so this ties your name to the first address withdrawn to. If you then pass that money on to someone else who gets busted, that may constitute enough evidence to open up a deeper investigation on you, because they know you sent the money to the dealer.

Perhaps you should read it again. The problem was not the question of whether or not he was being tipped, it was the manner in which he was being tipped. Bitcoin as opposed to cash. 
And in many restaurants, tipping is expected from all customers unless they were seriously disappointed in the service. Furthermore in many places it is compulsory and added to the bill. It's nothing about 'relying on goodwill', the waiter is earning his tip through his service, he is working for it.
And it is a bit much to tell him to go work for someone else. We can't always choose the places we work.

However, it should also be considered that the waiter has no way of verifying whether it is real until he gets home and tries it. You could hand him a slip of meaningless characters.
With cash you do not have this issue.

That's completely besides the point. I agree with you that Bitcoins can work well like this in the future. But we are talking about the present. The waiter, being someone who knows nothing about Bitcoin, has absolutely no reason to logically differentiate this piece of paper from something that looks like an obscure, complicated internet download. Put yourself in his shoes. I would argue that he is smart to be skeptical, in the same way that we are smart to not go to fishy links to claim our prize money etc.
Furthermore, he still has to go through the process of converting his Bitcoins into money in his bank account. And that is NOT straightforward. So arguably it is still pretty much an obscure, complicated internet download.

There are 25 squares, and 5 mines. The number of unordered ways of picking 20 squares from 25 squares is (25 choose 20). Out of all those ways, there is precisely one which is successful, i.e. picking 20 non-mines. Hence the probability of success is 1/(25 choose 20). Which is 1/53130.
If you pay 1 bitcoin, the expected jackpot returns are $12350 / 53130 = $0.23, which is about 0.5% of your bet, which doesn't change even if you make a smaller bet.

Again, you are not explaining why being wanted has anything to do with the use of Bitcoin. The fact that he is scared, doesn't change the fact that he is able to use it.
He simply has to change the Bitcoin for cash, then he can go around buying credit cards or food or whatever.
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:07:52
Again you are not seeing it from his perspective. You know it is not a download, and I know it is not a download. But from his point of view he doesn't know what it is, at all. It's just a piece of paper.
Why does he need to send Bitcoins to his bank account? Simply because he wants his money. You can't yet use bitcoins for everything online, you can't really use it for many things. I certainly am unable to use bitcoins to buy my food, pay my bills, etc.
And it is still just an experiment, it could collapse any day, the value could change wildly at any moment. So it is isn't really fair to insist on other people accepting it as real currency, when it isn't.
Agreed, such tips are only for people who want to try something new. But this isn't the situation here. The op clearly is not someone who wants to play this game (which he knows nothing about) and just wants his tips in cash. And from his story people are pushing bitcoins on him entirely against his interests.
And don't say it isn't complicated, because Bitcoin is complicated. Without a doubt. You and I may be more experienced in it, but many of the rest of the population find it complicated, even if it is spelled out to them.

@_date: 2013-06-22 17:31:27
You keep referencing the "situation" or "position" he is in without explaining exactly why you think he can't use Bitcoins. 
I don't see why the use and merits of Bitcoin changes at all when you are wanted by the US. That's the whole point of Bitcoin. I can use Bitcoin here in Hong Kong, and the US Government has no means of stopping me doing so, so why should it be any different for him?
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:13:43
These are just names. You could call it a fee, tip, whatever. It is widely understood what the term 'tip' means in this context.
Nobody is baiting and switching, this is very normal practice and is known to people who eat at restaurants. And they certainly don't hide it from you, if you ask what their system or expectations are then I'm sure they will happily explain it to you. They aren't trying to trick you, they just assume you know how tipping works.

I'm digging up my old spreadsheet. In my first year of work after graduating from University at 21 yrs, with an entry-level salary of $43 900, my total profit for the year was $13 500.
This is after all taxes paid (about 30% + negligible student loans repayments), rent paid for my personal apartment ($752 per month not inc. bills), buying new computer equipment for about $1 450, and a holiday for about $1 500.
I was single, lived in UK, no car, and was in no way heavily budgeting or scrimping.
I don't know how others may do it so differently, but after extrapolating it seems like $50k would have been easily achievable for me without any extraordinary effort. I've never really thought about it much, but I still don't see how it could be that difficult.

Personally I think the GRE is a pointless, expensive exam, which says nothing about a students ability. But many universities insist on students taking it before applications.

I'm not from the US, nor have I dined there. But out of the thirty-odd other countries I've eaten in, I have almost always seen tipping to be expected, or added to the bill as 'service charge'.
In the UK, when I eat with friends, it is always inherently assumed we tip. No issue has ever come up, we tip about 10-15% without hardly thinking about it.
I've always been under the impression that Americans are known for being better tippers than the Brits. Generally closer to 15-20%, rather than the standard 10% tip in UK? I'm not sure on numbers, but I am convinced that it is a widely accepted practice in US.
I believe there is probably a strong argument to why your logic would not apply to doctors or teachers. But I don't know, I'm no expert. You could be right, it could be the case that waiters give a better service when paid a fixed wage on trust. I have never seen any studies etiher way.
All I can say is, it is the way it is because it is.

It is normal practice in the sense that most of society has done it like this for so long, and hence it makes sense that restaurants will continue to work under the premise that customers do this.
If you walk into a restaurant which expects tips, and sit down and order then you are pretty much agreeing to the system. You have every right to refuse to tip I guess, but I think the waiter also has every right to grudge about it. He makes his living this way, and he doesn't get to choose how society works. If the tip was compulsory, then the waiter wouldn't have much incentive to give you a good service. But since it's not compulsory, he makes an extra effort to give you a good service to earn your tip. Don't blame it on him or his boss, blame it on society and culture.

Why should the amount matter? Sure, all those fancy features are free and useful, but if you lose your money that's as valid as a complaint can get. And I'd hardly call him a whiner, he made a huge effort to get it back before coming to Reddit.
It was not simply 'delayed'. There was no telling whether he would ever get it back until he made a show of it.
Online wallets have benefits as well as disadvantages. The small risks are not enough to just say 'never use them', nor is it naive to do so.

My main issue with Bitcoin sites is registration, as I am unable to supply a UK phone number or utility bill. Would this process require either of those?

A finite *divisible* currency.

I had this problem for the past week. Suddenly today (just after sending an email to the founder and wasting his time) I thought about removing the https from the URL. It worked and took me to the accept payout screen.
Hope this works for you if it happens to be the case that you were including https in the link.

Transferring my salary back to my home country.

Yes I agree. I tried to buy my first few hundred £'s worth yesterday, for the purpose of using them for online poker, not investing. I managed to secure a deal before the rise began. Now I fear the guy will selfishly pull out of the deal after all the rises, leaving me with nothing but a higher price to face tomorrow. I initially only intended for it to be a way of translating money to poker chips, but the sheer rapidness of this market is super stressful, I feel like I'm supposed to be hoarding all the bitcoins now.

24 now. Well my circumstances have changed somewhat as I went back to Uni. But I have saved around $36500. And no I would never throw it all on Bitcoin, only a fixed percentage like 5%.

Except if BTC crashes, somehow I doubt search trends will plummet.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:59:00
Well I just buy any loose bitcoins I can find locally or amongst my colleagues here in the Middle East. And I can exchange it person-to-person via my home banks in UK. Of course it depends on how many sellers are available (not many). And I don't manage to transfer all my salary, just a slim fraction. The rest of the salary I have to move with bank to bank transfer and pay something like 2% for fees, sigh.

This confused me too. But why the heck are they using the same symbol as the decimal point? How are you supposed to distinguish between the two?

Then what am I going to do with all these quail eggs?

Unfortunately Facebook has been around long enough for my friends to know to ignore any app requests they receive, no exceptions.

If you want to send via Transferwise to bitstamp, you can use my referral for a free transfer:
People have suggested that one of the cheapest methods is to send GBP through Transferwise to convert to Eur, and send the Eur to Bitstamp.

Or just stop posting these altogether?
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:16:14
I'm not so sure. I'm trying right now to go directly to my wallet with www in front, but it doesn't work. It only works when I go to instawallet.org first and then append.

We need a bitcoin scavenger hunt subreddit! Or is there one?
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:00:42
I'm sure it wouldn't affect local trades.

How many days has it been?

Really, I'm the one trolling? All you keep doing in this thread is insulting people's intelligence and telling them to stop living in fantasy worlds, without ever explaining your original claim.

Everything you say is fair if this was a gift.
But it's not a gift, it's a tip. A tip in most cultures and societies is considered to be a wage, and should therefore be paid as such. You are paying the waiter for the work he put in to giving you good service.
What you say about supplementing real cash with a bit of Bitcoin on the side does sound like a step in the right direction, as long as the cash amount is sufficiently high so that the Bitcoin tip can be seen as bonus.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:03:27
I don't see how this paragraph is in any way relevant. It is talking about the mandatory service charge, as opposed to tipping. We're talking about tipping here.
I never said I believe tipping should not be optional. I strongly believe it SHOULD be optional. I don't know how you managed to assume otherwise.
Furthermore I am not trying to argue whether or not tipping SHOULD be optional, I'm just saying this is the way things are.

That's how I roll.

So, what happens if you lose your phone? Which I do fairly often.
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:24:37
You need a control test. Try advising them that they should accept quail eggs as payment and see if they are looking into that as well.
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:00:54
So if you can't get another phone with the same number, you have lost access to the wallet?
I'm not that knowledgeable about phones, I didn't know you could get the old phone number again if you lose it. But in my case I don't think that's an option so I had better not use 2-factor.
