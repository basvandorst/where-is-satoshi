Beneficial until a coordinated pump and dump occurs. Whenever you are doing TA, there are always people that notice the trend and try to predict how to beat it. There are plenty of people that bought BTC around 3k, the price wouldnt have skyrocketed like it did if it wasnt bought en masse. People are forgetting that at 8k, its still 100% return if bought at 4k. Say a whale bought in at 3,4, and 5k. Say 1 million BTC all in all for 4million + tx fees. They average out at about 4k. They hire an analyst or two and Each time BTC skyrockets, they short it a % or two, or whatever they can to make a profit. Flash forward 6months, they might now have 1.1 million BTC from trading after paying off the trader. At this point, there are more and more people that have bought in over $5k. At this point, not many people are comfortable selling crypto especially if they bought in above 8k. But this dickhead whale is still up 4 MILLION. Homeboy makes the analyst set revolving orders with large trade walls, and placing slightly lower order underneath it for less. BTC falls below 8k, they keep driving the price down with huge pressure from large orders. Buy orders are fulfilled, but not at a rate fast enough to break the wall, so the price keeps getting lower. Maybe they plan a big wall at 75 and sell off right below it, then panic sets in and people sell of their BTC driving it down to 7k. On the other end, the Whale plans to buy back in reverse, so if they sold 20k at 7900 20k at 7800. Of course they cant buy it all back at 7k, so they put in buy orders up to 7400 or so. All of the sudden, they now have 1.15 million BTC, and an extra $75k in cash because they dont care about BTC, and they dont care who they have to fuck over to get it. All they care about our their sweet sweet racks.

The only fools are the people that sell their crypto for a loss. Trading a $1000 swing is perfectly fine if you catch the market at what you think is the peak of a big jump. Crypto ALWAYS gets overbought and sold, so when you see it up 20+% its a good sign that you can short for a few %. Same for when its down 20%, except this is where your strategy of hodling comes in. Traders, especially crypto traders are super emotional and tend to get lost in the sauce. IF you have a whole bitcoin, why not sell 10% of it when it's up 20%, and buy it back when its down to 18%. Then you make an easy 0.002 BTC. Are you really stacking sats if you arent letting your sats stack themselves? Or are you just too scared to take financial risks and willing to bank on the dream and hopes that one day, maybe one day, BTC will be worth a million dollars.  Us nerds might be confident in BTC and while it is a better alternative, but there are just too many people that rely on the USD and get paid good money to make sure that this will not happen. I mean what happens when someone finally cracks the code and hacks into the blockcain and steals them all?!?!? People like BTC but the fact that there is no (known) entity that controls it just means it will be taken over by someone that figures out how it works. What if Satoshi is actually a sociopath and is trying to get BTC as high as possible only to sell out the millions they have? Or satoshi is actually some government. There are just too many factors, so utnil we figure it out i say we trade. If BTC really does reach 1 million, then all those sats you stacked from trading will be worth half a shit. Idk, just some food for thought.

That’s not going to happen overnight. If you actually keep up with the news you would be able to see the trends causing that shift because bitcoin is king right now and it’s gonna take a really strong crypto to take over. Ethereum is the next closest coin and it’s trading around $150 while bitcoin is at $3500-$4000. If there’s an attitude shift with bitcoin because large institutions start shitting on it and praising eth for whatever reason you switch it over. It’s really not that hard all it takes is the investor keeping up with news and trends within the industry. Or you could continue to be scared of the tech to trash talk it. That’s cool too, Iess people buying keeps the price low and gives me more of a chance to buy more at these low prices. And I’ll have a huge smile on my face when it pops off and everyone is on the crypto wave again bringing the price higher than it’s ever gone before ������

Also i am not saying crypto as a whole will fail. I think cryptocurrency is here to stay, and will be an integral part of the future of finances. But BTC, forget about it. From TX fees, time to send tx, and the fact that there is no real company working on it, securing it, and updating it, I really do not think BTC will be the currency of the future. Sure its decentralized, but the centralization of other crytos is merely a single pixel on your screen compared to the centralization of Fiat currency, which takes up half the screen. I personally think this small centralization, with a company that is able to acitvely communicate and receive feedback from users, not to mention ability PROTECT IT's PRODUCT and peoples funds from hackers and scams will be much more effective and relieving than the unknown entity that governs BTC.
