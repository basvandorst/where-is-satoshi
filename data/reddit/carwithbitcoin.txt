You're not the only one... damn.

WeUseCoins.com is also a good start for newbies.

Nice. Looks cool. I hope they bring it to android too.

They shut him down? When?
@_date: 2015-06-02 06:00:34
Glad they went with Lamassu one.

Awesome follow up from BTC China. You're lucky an honest miner group got your transaction.

It's funny how they say it like bitcoin just started yesterday. However it's a great article.

What can be done to get faster confirmation times? Why 0/1 confirmations are not accepted as enough by the masses? How common is a double spend?

Finally, a breath of fresh air!
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:52:51
I guess I get why they're doing it. Thanks.

Yet nearly all bitcoin debit cards are MasterCard. Go figure...

Wasn't that the first proposal from months ago? To gradually increase the blocksize until all the bitcoins are mined? Then BAM 20MB starting "tomorrow"

They don't like it, because they cannot track him? This is horrible business strategy...

It's great. The map looks cool, and everything is smooth. Great job!

I am glad I don't have a need to use PayPal.
@_date: 2015-06-03 09:36:04
Once I get back on my feet, I will start buying more.

What is the difference between this and protonmail?
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:51:11
I don't want to wait for 6 confirmations. If 1 is enough then why we're not seeing websites adopt it for faster transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-04 07:49:39
Is that the "reasonable" traffic usage per household in the US?

Xapo is VISA, yes.

Thanks for your hard work! I will check the Bitcoin Flapper.
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:12:09
Is this a good thing?
