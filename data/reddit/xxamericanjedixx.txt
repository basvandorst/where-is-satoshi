I agree, but I view it as both a commodity and a currency.  I had never thought of it as a commodity until I tried explaining it to my dad.  He was skeptical, and he ended up asking "what is Bitcoin backed by?"  My response, although it took me a while to realize it, was "what are silver and gold backed by?"  Physical silver and gold can be used as currency without needing certificates to be printed that are backed by a specific weight of a commodity.  Despite being backed by nothing, silver and gold can be used as currency because they are scarce, and you can't just print more of them.  The same is true of Bitcoins.  They are a currency which is also a commodity.  Being scarce, divisible, and impossible to counterfeit makes them ideal.

Stray bullets aren't the dangerous part of this test.  They are using a very fragile lower receiver which could easily shatter upon having a bullet fired inside of it.  They ought to be taking precautions similar to those described in section 3.2 of the [US Army Improvised munitions handbook](

Have fun selling at a low price to people that aren't contributing to this panic bullshit.

I bought at $10, but it still makes me sad when I see the price fall like that.

I can't log in.  I have a lot of Bitcoins on mtgox.  Fuck.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:11:00
I'm holding.  I've been holding all day.  They're still worth more than they were 2 weeks ago

That's what I'm hoping for.  And I bought about 80BTC in November, so I'm still way better off than if I hadn't invested at all.  [Watching the price plummet like that was just so sad though](

I'll just sell a little bit whenever I see the price dropping.  This causes the price to rise every time without fail.  It's like some kind of superpower.

That's one of the things I had in mind.  Do you know of any reputable sources with statistics on credit card fraud and chargebacks?

Thanks.  I had mostly been focusing on the benefits over credit cards and hadn't thought of the advantages over cash.  This will be helpful.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:47:01
I have about 95BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-16 07:10:48


Then I want nothing to do with it.  Fuck off and stop trying to ruin Bitcoin.

No.  I thought that I was late when I bought at $10/BTC.  We're going to the moon!
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:27:19
I think Krugman still hates Bitcoin though, so we're probably fine.
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:38:45
I bought 10.4 BTC today at $46/BTC.  FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!

Do you know of a secure and easy way to create a paper wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:39:48
$10,000.  But I bought at $13, so I'm still doing pretty great
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:40:25
It keeps dropping to just above $500 and then immediately jumping back up to $585.  I think there's something wrong with the ticker.

A socialist bitcoin user... Which is it, do you hate freedom or love it?

According to a podcast that I listened to this morning, it was a free-stater in Keene, New Hampshire.

How much would it cost to ship one to Oklahoma?  And how would the price be affected by ordering more than one?
@_date: 2013-03-07 05:10:39
Did you miss the last 6 hours?  The price went from $45 to $34 in a matter of minutes, and then back up to $44, and then back down to the high $30s, and now it's holding steady at around $40.
