Yeah, but flux was a battery drain. Apple's implementation is better, as an integrated part of the OS.

You're funny. But I'd just like to point out, they recently approved a C++ IDE which builds and runs code on the device. The language restriction part of your joke is stretching it...

you said that miners mine 100% transaction fees. I am explaining to you where bitcoins actually come from. it's not just transaction fees, and at no point in your original post did you acknowledge anything more than transaction fees.
when you make a transaction you pay for the fee. where did that bitcoin come from? it wasn't another transaction fee. it was from a miner successfully "winning a block" where they got 25, or 12.5 or half that, or half that, etc.
I never said it was an endless supply, in fact if you used common sense and thought about the system consistently halving the reward you might come to realize there's a finite supply of them. not to mention, i did in fact say "difficulty scales based on how any are left and how many are mining at once".. what did you think I meant by "how many are left"?

Miners do verify transactions but that’s not all. All miners compete (difficulty scales based on how many are left and how many are mining at once) to win a block of coins. When it all started you’d get 25 BTC, and that was halved to 12.5. I don’t know what it is now. I could be getting some of this wrong, but there’s definitely more to mining than *just* verifying transactions.

I am going to have to stop you there and point out that you are calling money from a mint "counterfeit".
I don't think you know what that word means.

No, they have offered the source to Darwin since the first version of OS X. Darwin is of course their fork of BSD, which powers both OS X and iOS.
I don't blame you for not knowing- most people don't. It is common misinformation spread across the internet that Apple has no foot in open source software. It's one of the many things spread by people just repeating what they read someone else say.
IMHO in regards to their "stance" on Bitcoin, is they would rather avoid news stories of people losing their Bitcoin wallets for whatever reason, and they also already ban apps that allow you to buy things that don't use the iTunes IAP method. It is definitely not censorship (they are allowed to curate their own store however they see fit, just like any retailer), but I also don't think they are trying to hold it back from success or anything crazy like that. They are just covering their own ass.

In the SJ book, and also the original iPhone announcement keynote, it was said the iPhone was in development for 4 years, but that probably includes the time when it was going to be a tablet. So 2003 is more like it.

$6 is nothing. be happy it wasn't $13,000 worth, with $6,000 lost or more. just hold onto it, it'll go back up, probably sooner than you think. it has every time so far. (granted, I'm no fortune teller). but this has happened many times before in basically every market, every stock, etc known to man.

Do you live in SF? Are you aware of the rent situation here? It's out of control. Long story short: yes it's difficult to find a place for under 3k in SF.

oh, d'oh, when I checked their site this morning on my phone, I misread the little "CloudFlare" header on the site. I saw "live update" and got excited. Wishful thinking I guess.
