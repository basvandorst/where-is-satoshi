What about making a paper segwit wallet and just moving all funds over to that for now?

I am triyng to to figure out how to consolidate some of my addresses with many TXs to a segwit address in BTC Core.... I understand this needs to be done with the cmd line, but what do I use for ADDR?
CMD :&gt; addwitnessaddress addr

Exactly what I needed to know.  I still plan regular backups but have not yet done so after creating some new addresses.  Since I am using the latest version with HD, I should be good to go.   
I also agree it’s sad I need that disclaimer, but last time I didn’t add it and asked a question about the core app, I got a load of shit.

@_date: 2018-06-29 15:32:39
I think with the new HD wallet one backup is good forever.  Use a strong password and store in a few secure places.

Assuming this is windows, modify your short cut to something like this....  You can just copy your wallet.dat in and be good to go.  If you are starting fresh, it will download and prune as it goes.

Maybe I need to clarify... I am talking Bitcoin, but Bitcoin Core Wallet
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:30:46
This is what I currently do.  I have the encrypted wallet.dat in a compressed file that is also encrypted with a different password.  
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:21:22
Please send to me.  I’ll take good care of them for you.

Bitcoin needs full blocks

As much as I think trends and patterns are mostly BS, I sure hope you are right ��
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:57:55
That’s normal.  My average is 14.2 but varies at any given time.

What about effort to promote a new website that explains bitcoin and the bcash scam and get it to the  spot on google when searching bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:48:06
Well known information.

I sent it there by accident.   I’ll give you an address to send it back to ��

Or not worry about having to.   Adoption might allow you to just spend the BTC most places you want to use.

Safe to buy on Coinbase but move bitcoin off to your own wallet immediately.

@_date: 2019-05-27 01:21:56
Just don’t keep it there.
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:18:55
Why don't you trust them?
@_date: 2019-05-08 01:36:52
Your prob fine.

Look at the last graph.   Mempool filling.  
If the fee was low you were on the bottom of the list.
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:26:00
Whales just wanted to let the mempool clear

Let’s say there is a bus that holds 50 people.   Your at the bus stop with 400 people in front of you.  More keep coming and get to cut you in line because they paid more for their ticket.   Eventually enough busses will come and get everyone in line but will take some time.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:27:26
Ahh.  Didn’t think of that one.
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:49:31

You can export your private keys, then import into the wallet of your choice if you wanted.
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:13:55
I bet it’s a dude too....
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:27:17
Its pretty hard to accidentally type in a wrong address that actually belongs to someone.
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:13:21
Scam scam scam
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:27:17
Not your keys, not your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:40:54
Makes sense...
