From what I understand the price you bought at gets locked in until your funds are available, someone correct me if I’m wrong. If you are going to transfer off the exchange. Get on their exchange called GDAX and transfer from there without paying any fees.

GDAX transferring of their exchange is free

Put it back in that bitch and buy some btc. Then send it to your own wallet so it can’t be somehow reversed lol

What state are you in

What are you talking about? Where did I encourage cheating? I linked him to his states DMV website where it states the requirements to get an ID card which you could get when you’re under 18 in ILLINOIS. Wether or not Coinbase requires you to be 18 like I was saying, I’m not sure about that.

Yes setup you’re own mining rig with a quite a few 1080ti and mine vertcoin. Very profitable at the moment and poised to rise

I think most states you can go to the dmv and get an identification card regardless of age, weather or not Coinbase allows under 18 I’m not sure

I wouldn’t click anywhere near any links that were sent via email. I’m sure you knew that already must making sure

Well “mining” is also the way transactions are settled when btc payments are sent on the block chain so there will always be people mining. The transaction fees is where the incentives will be so I think people will continue to mine

That’s a good question

Seems like a bluff honestly. They probably send these out to tons of people hoping someone will fall victim to it. They are getting clever let me tell you lol.
