I don’t do what you do with all the charts and calculations cause I am a noob and just do t know how to do it and just kinda go on sentiments i read and gut feeling. But I kinda agree with you because just when I feel it’s going up for sure it dips a hour/ day or sometime later. So I’ll wait a bit as well. Btw thanks for sharing ur insights and experience. ����

Doesn’t feel like it will go down anymore. I don’t know. Is the Chance gone to buy the dip or is another drop lower incoming?

I think this is a genuine nice thing ur doing. I had a great relationship with my granddad too. We would talk about all sorts of things. I helped him on a few things and he taught me a lot on how to work and think smart and around problems. He confided in me with his businesses and I told him about all of my plans. He was always happy to give me a helping hand and I would be more than happy just to spend the time with him that I had. He passed away and the whole family got a little something and that was that. If your grandfather is worth as much as you say and you guys talk and he is interested I’m sure he would even buy it to someday give it too you anyways, whether as a present or inheritance. He sees it’s worth a lot to u and u r showing spirit, interest, perseverance  and diligence. Something not everyone has. For him this is a small amount of his money he is happy to invest, not just in bitcoin but in you and your future. If other people can’t relate to your relationship with your granddad that’s just how it is. Enjoy the time you have with him, call him and tell him good things and if he is as you say then any second he can spend with you is worth more to him than a few thousand bucks. Believe me, I miss my grandad every day.

You should reverse it and send a msg back saying that its a weird coincidence and you are also a hacker and have his browser history. And if he doesn't send you 1000$ you will send all his history and such. Ya never know, might be good for a laugh :D
