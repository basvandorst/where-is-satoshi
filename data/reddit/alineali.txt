Well, first three parts are obvious, but as for block size? I would say that my node is doing just fine, and people are starting and running nodes on Raspberry Pis! I would say that node running cost is pretty acceptable now for anyone. Of course most will not do it anyway and will rely even not on SPV but on online wallets and exchanges - but I think it cannot be helped.

I suppose this is about "virtual bytes", as with Segwit weights of segwit and non-segwit bytes are different (1:4), so one non-sewit byte is counted as for segwit bytes.

May be it is not really a solution but I do not see any scenario where this would change. Might as well use what means are available now to keep bitcoin competitive - and segwit is useful here.
The same about spam - if it cannot be differentiated from non-spam and stopped than probably it is not spam to begin with, but fully legitimate use of existing system even if we do not like it.

There are many problems with Bitcoin Cash's approach (which is obvious from their hashrate and absent development team), but in regard to fees it is really simple. Mining will be paid for. Either by fees or by inflation. For bitcoin direction is very clear. If someone wants inflation - it is up to them and their forks.

Because the more full nodes are actually used the harder for someone (like Bitmain and Co) to force their rules upon community. Which clearly was shown with UASF.
And because with your own node you get some guarantees - about privacy, about following right chain and so on.

Antonopoulos may believe anything he wants but I did not hear any real arguments why this is not zero-sum game. From what I see these alts divert resources from bitcoin - be it money, development effort or publicity. Even if they gain more then bitcoin loses and overlall this is a gain for "crypto space" - why should I care? I care specifically about bitcoin and the last thing I want is some other project making it irrelevant - because then I would constantly monitor situation jump to something else in time. Now I can just buy little amount of bitcoin every time I have some extra money and hodl knowing that some time in the future it will be useful for me. 
There is another consideration - it is better to have one tool that works good enough then hundred competing attempts to achieve (local) perfection - just because it is too much hassle to deal with them all both for merchants and consumers.
Third - we all know that network security depends not on absolute hashrate but on inability of attacker to get comparable hash rate. The more resources will be put in bitcoin the less will be left to build attack force (which bitmain actually attempted).
@_date: 2019-03-02 10:42:26
Even then you just lose your money without bodily harm.
But usually if you exchange money and transfer bitcoins to you own wallet you are fine, as the risk windows is pretty small. Also as operation is simple and takes very little time you can do exchange at any moment with any sum.
Of course those who keep bitcoins on exchange have more chances to lose them.

First, You said it yourself - 


So TODAY is definitely bad time to increase block size. If situation changes in the future - well, then it will be time to decide what to do. And second, if you check not fifty but five years you'll find that storage is at almost same price level. Bandwidth is even worse and it is much more costly to upgrade.
I personally think that there is simply no need for larger blocks in the near future as  Lightning (which gives speed and privacy) will handle all day-to day trade and blockchain will remain only as settlement layer that gives needed guarantees for upper layers. Add to it space saved by Schnorr/MAST and we are good for quite some time.

Why not just stick with satoshis/bitcoins?
"Bit" have a several meaning already, why add another? Sure, it can be done and people can handle it, but why introduce ambiguity if you can avoid it?
Bitcoin is already established unit, and satoshi is (unlike everything else including bitcoin itself) natural unit of a system, they are what is actually recorded in blockchain.

Satoshi is not "new base", this is literally only non-artificial base.
@_date: 2019-11-15 23:19:10
Generally it is true but in current implementation there is limit and without code foxes you cannot include less then 1 sat in any part of transaction. But as mentioned above fee is actually is paid for the entire transaction, and sat/b is just a "price". Actual fee is then computed as "price" * "transaction weight (in vB)".
@_date: 2019-03-02 09:37:00
The thins is, for UASF you need not just nodes, but nodes that belong to entities doing actual transactions - the threat is that actual, real transactions will not go to "wrong" blockchain as block from it will be rejected - not by some fakes (which are not important at all) but by actual active users.

@_date: 2019-03-10 18:57:05
Actually I am not a speculator - I just want to have my saving in some form that will not require any actions from me and will be as much independent from at least local state as possible - exactly what "storage of value" means. So part of these savings goes to bitcoin. Ability to spend where I want, not where state allows me to is important for me as well, still this is mostly in the future. 
I do not see anything wrong with this position. Actually I see it as one of few that would be easily understood by most people once they will get used to the idea that bitcoin is not going to die in the near future.
On more abstract level I'm all for diversity while some new tech or system is in early development and needs to find optimal solutions, but I'm against building another Tower of Babel which will complicate things for everyone - and I think that "early development" phase for bitcoin is in the past, there may be some technical fixes like Schnorr/MAST ahead, but mostly development should be on higher layers (Lightning is one of them) which can appear and die without really affecting basic ecosystem and still depend on it. Now THIS would not be zero-sum game - bitcoin usefulness would only increase with addition of new higher-level features, without competition like what happens between coins.
@_date: 2019-03-02 23:15:37
No. Because then someone will just alter criteria... then again and again...
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:07:27
But people a NOT "economically priced out of using raw Bitcoin" - without all that drama segwit would be activated almost year ago and at this point we would know if it is enough or not - and if not we would  probably have some sound and well thought plan of block increase from Core.
And there we can move to the reason pointed by original poster that is much more important in my opinion.
I'm software developer and followed some code changes and some discussions by Core - by far this is the BEST managed and secure project that I saw, with very carefully introduced changes, with deep discussions about implications, rigorous testing.
This is exactly how money-related software should be developed. And for me this is good enough reason to reject any and all alternatives - they are just worse in this area. Hard fork prepared in one month time? Discussions behind closed doors in some closed Slack channel? Sorry, but this is just asking for disaster, and question is not whether it happens, but when.
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:37:48
No Core does not decide how many transactions are "really required". But when it will be obvious that current limit is too low there will be no wide resistance to upping it, and it will require real consensus (to upgrade nodes), not some conspiracy between few entities.
I do not claim what Lightning will be at all. I claim that changes should be done based on evidence, not on some untested hypothesis. You do not even know how connection graph will look and about what size of fees we are talking. When there will be some statystics (at least several moths after segwit launch) it will be time to start thinking if something else needed.
The whole point is "let's see, and then act accordingly, without haste and with good planning". Improvements are good but what we have now is good enough, it's important to preserve it in the first place, and only then improve.
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:43:24
1) How exactly you imagine "centrally managed fee market" with miners being free to include in block any transactions they want?
2) How exactly you imagine "centrally managed fee market" in decentralized by design Lightning network?
edit: If you are not enamored with Core's project management I cannot imagine your unhappiness about half-baked dev process of btc1 or BCH.
@_date: 2019-08-08 19:14:00
Well, "Medicare-for-all" is pure socialism
@_date: 2019-08-01 07:54:15
The problem with this reasoning is that it ignores rarity. If it was just about increased cost it would be better (ignoring "fixed cost" assumption), but it's not like you could buy any amount of bitcoin for 12000 or 24000 or whatever - supply is limited. And of course, most of demand pressure comes not from "real world demand for a decentralized and borderless currency and store of value" (I wish it was), but from speculation. Add psychology of limited supply is important too ("there will be almost no new bitcoin soon!") - it surely adds to hype.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:45:13
Sorry, but this is a lie. Did you see Core's scaling roadmap? "Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals (such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase)". It's  referenced from  as thei'r roadmap.
So their idea - that I find completely reasonable - is to increase capability one step at a time, beginning from most useful with lowest risk (segwit) and do only what is really required, not what is deemed as needed without evidence. 
Also core does not not directly benefit from raised fees. Miners, on the other hand, understandably want highest possibly fees. Preferably at the cost of someone else, like those full-node runners who will need to store all low-fee garbage (even not related to payments at all) that can be added to big blocks.
The same problem as with speculation about post-segwit fees goes for Lightning, even more so. Not only you cannot predict how many transactions will fit in segwit-enabled blocks in real world and if it will be enough or not, you also cannot predict anything in Lightning networks - neither centralization, nor fees. This is new territory and we need evidence first. And if this will not work, only then - see above - some block increase may be good idea.
But for block increase miners are the last entities who should decide what block size we need - of course they want biggest block possible, to get all fees and throw away any control of independent full nodes. With core model we really get security from many full nodes enforcing rules and incentive to invent something alternative - be it Lightning, mimblewimble or something else. And this is in the interests not just miners but everyone.
@_date: 2019-08-16 13:12:58
...or people will wisen up and really use birth control. Or (much more probably) in 2600 biological humans will be extinct for several hundreds of years...

Miners are not only participants, in fact economically active nodes decide what happens as we saw with UASF. So I would expect move to another hashing algo if evidence of attack will be good enough. There is not "formal voting" or formal definition of " economically active nodes" for this - just negotiations between people and companies. Which is good in my book as formal rules always have some holes, but people are more flexible.
As for cost - first this boils down to question how much coins do you need to really affect PoS system. In PoW you too do not need real 51% of hash rate but this will lengthen an attack and, as it is hard to hide it - something will be done about it. With PoS you too can buy (or steal, or seize) some lesser but substantial amount and do something with it - it will take longer but it will be too late to do something when attacker reveals themselves. Also for entites we are talking about it is not that hard to cause massive price dip - and may be even profit from it aside from amassing coins. Actually it would be much easier than target miners - who, while being potential targets, are spread over the world and bigger ones are probably taking some measures against such attacks.
@_date: 2019-08-16 13:30:04
Actually after an attack on PoW-based system (and I mean bitcoin of course) you will be left with a pile of worthless ASICs - I highly doubt anyone would be interested in them if THE cryprocurrency failed. Also do you really think that entity large enough to be able to implement such an attack would be really concerned about funds spent?
Then if you take into account market manipulations and other dirty tricks it will be much easier to get good amount of PoS cryptocurrency  - probably event without anyone noticing - then to buy huge amount of hardware for PoW, find where to install it and so on. This is actually would be very important for me - things would work perfectly until sudden collapse.
@_date: 2019-08-23 21:02:22
Yes, but technical limitation is a temporary condition (the only question is how temporary it is - I personally think that blocks are too big). Fee market, on the other side, is important for bitcoin to remain viable long term. If fees will be too low network security could become at risk.
@_date: 2019-08-15 06:52:45
Please note that first one consists of many addresses, and second probably too.
@_date: 2019-08-18 22:45:30
Basically this can be divided into three sections:
1) paranoia - like "someone can intercept what you send to your printer over wifi" - maybe they can, but this would be done if you are  already under some kind of surveillance, as there is no way to steal and scan all documents from all printers in the world. And if someone really attacks you personally - probably you are already screwed.
2) you do not understand what is going all (like a case with import of private key into deterministic wallet) - well, with bitcoin this is almost always a recipe for disaster
3) general "bad practice" warning - like using web sites instead of offline generators or reusing keys. These cases have nothing really to do with paper wallet itself.
If you understand what you are doing there is nothing really wrong with "paper" (or steel, or whatever) wallets, and as they do not depend on derivation path, additional pins, passwords and so on they are actually quite reliable and will probably work for many many years in any mainstream wallet software.
@_date: 2019-08-12 07:01:42
So basically coinjoin will be much cheaper than individual transaction. Which means additional powerful incentive to do it.
@_date: 2019-08-19 23:38:48
Yes, sure. That's why miners backed off. 
UASF threatened to impose very specific limitation on blocks - any block not signaling SegWit would be rejected. What is it if not a modification of consensus rule?
@_date: 2019-08-13 00:25:52
So your answer is continuous price increase. Understood, but I would say this is very risky assumption. At least I never saw more "insane" price prediction than $1000000. Which will not be enough in 30 years to give miners same money they get today.
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:03:58
Actually this is true about every efficient thing. Or you use something with a ton of safeguards and of course you are paying (and overpaying) for them.
@_date: 2019-08-12 06:58:22
I hope not. Or we either have increased emission or hash rate will severely decrease obviously both scenarios are catastrophic. I'm assuming bitcoin is still there after another two or three halvenings.
@_date: 2019-10-20 20:01:15
Because the security of Lightning payments is based on the ability to use blockchain to settle dispute
@_date: 2019-08-12 20:03:43
When subsidy decreases if you want to maintain current emission schedule and keep network secure you need either bitcoin price increase or higher fees to compensate miner expenses. Right now the main source is emission (i.e. inflation), but soon or late it will need to be replaced by fees.
Actually I think most of block space will be used by anchoring transactions from different private chains, and for this owners of these chains can pay large enough sums so it will drive fees up.
@_date: 2019-08-19 07:24:20
Do you really expect honest answer from any bitcoin owner about such a thing? Especially when we are talking about security. No, I do not have any bitcoin, now I'm just observing how it goes. I was dumb and traded too much trying to getting rich quick.
In the  "average Joe" case (not someone rich, they have their own set of security concerns, including hidden cameras and so on) I do not see any realistic attack scenario with printing 12 words or private key - of course with your own printer. If you are watched that closely you probably have much bigger reasons to worry as attacked definitely will notice that you are interested in bitcoin, will most probably know about your financial transactions and then 5-dollar wrench or its equivalent from government will do the rest. And it would be impossible to monitor and parse everything people print for something specific like bitcoin keys or seed phrase. What I would worry about is using right operating system - probably some kind of LiveUSB with mainstream Linux would suffice.
@_date: 2019-10-02 19:31:13
I'm not sure if this is a good thing. If bitcoin is associated with crazy dictators like Maduro it will only hurt it's image
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:40:03
Miners do not create rules. Miners do not even enforce rules. They cannot "change the protocol". Economically active nodes do all of this. You are confused because you cannot votes - but when anyone actually tries to change rules they find out that they need to achieve real consensus with real nodes - or else they will get blockchain that nobody uses.
Miners just set and broadcast order in which transactions get into blockchain.
By the way if those who want another government or president would be able to fork away it would be very interesting (and, I think, much more productive).
@_date: 2019-10-02 19:38:17
No, you are not the only one. What is the point of adoption of bitcoin in destroyed country-outcast? So Maduro would be able to keep power and kill people? If he was replaced by someone more reasonable I would be happy with such development, but now it will only hurt bitcoin and give additional incentive for real governments to ban/limit/control its usage. And right now they can easily do it without much problems as bitcoin does not really affects them
@_date: 2019-08-16 14:47:31
But if majority bitcoin owners decide to change consensus rules it will be exactly the same. As I mentioned UASF have shown us that.
@_date: 2019-10-02 19:33:48
So now will not be "bitcoin is for criminals", but also "bitcoin is for dictators". Sure, it will help adoption where it really matters - in normal countries where economy actually exists. /s
@_date: 2019-10-02 19:41:22
But it is not very hard to stop normal people - citizens of normal countries - from using bitcoin because of its usage by Maduro and his likes
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:47:00
They also mention SegWit and LN. And the whole idea is that fees are still small which is true.
@_date: 2019-10-28 10:12:11
I do not see anything wrong with his approach. hw wallet are nice but very limited in abilities, and disconnected desktop (with Linux of course) is definitely secure - even against physical attacks if there is good pass phrase and the wallet is not unlocked (and it does not need to be unlocked except the time where he want to spend his coins or rare cases when bitcoin software upgrade requires it).
Still I think this level of worry is not really warranted. If you do not talk left and right that you own bitcoin, have good passphrase and backup (or seed if you like it more) and you are only accumulating which means this passphrase is never entered you are pretty much safe even with just bitcoin core on desktop. On Linux of course.
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:45:58
Perfect example :-) There was attempt from miners to increase block size and to increase their "voting power" by pushing out nodes that would not be able to handle increased bandwidth/CPU power/space requirements (which is, of course, against bitcoin community interest). And it ended with UASF which put miners into their place.

Bitcoin has Lightning for this. Which can help both with privacy and scaling.
IMO this is a good example of the architecture done right - relatively simple strong first level and more complex or special purpose second level solutions. And in this way if you have several bitcoin-based second-layer solution even competing they will reinforce each other by increasing usefulness of their common platform. Actually this is what happens with Ethereum except that Ethereum got many problems due to it's complexity.

No, the question is - why study and get certifications for something that does not bring you enough money? Either it is simple miscalculation - like betting on dotcom boom (or bitcoin boom for that matter) or you have not done your research. And yes, if market is right (and if real market exists in the first place) selling drugs is more useful than being another EMT. The price is  a literal measure of usefulness, you do not have anything other - except for your fantasies. But actual answer, of course, is that there is no really free market neither for medical services nor for drug dealers - both are heavily regulated.
Now there are so many ways to make money - from actual "useful" things like IT sphere to something like handmade stuff and art to ridiculous YouTube videos and so on, so many ways to learn - again, using online resources - that it is hard to not find anything at all.
As for rent-seeking - for libertarian it seems the direct consequence of monopolization which (at least at modern times) is always happens because of some privileges or limitations created by state - be it "intellectual property", licensing or other means.
But yes, probably there will be people who a literally not needed. Well, too bad for them - if you are not payed (i.e. useful for economy) and so awful that no-one wants to support you - neither your relatives, nor just people who like you - then it is your problem.

By the way I'm not big fan of carrying "small amount to pay for stuff", you never know when you will need money. Of course I would not carry my year-worth earnings, but tenth of that? Easily. And most people do the same with amounts that are accessible through theirs bank cards. 
As for "another device" - I do not mind specialized devices, they do their primary job much better then "Jack of all trades".

Police and court as service is not a problem at all - there is very clear service that can be given or not given depending on payment. These services do not even have to be provided by state. As for army - actually I forgot to continue my phrase - it should have been "police as service is simple, army is not that simple". And this is mostly you cannot stop serving one specific individual.

I have several problems with this idea.
1. If we do the math then with linear increase we will have 10% inflation in 11 years, 5% in 21 years, 3.44% in 30 years. I would not call this "negligible". You can compare this with bitcoin inflation rate: 
2. I do not like the idea of "incentive to spend", this is exactly why I like bitcoin and do not like fiat - you just exchange money for goods, without someone deciding how you should use them.
3. I think Grin creators are actually lying - they just could not figure out how to add miner fees into their system. And while Monero creators were honest about it these guys were not - they prefer to talk about "money vs storage of value" dichotomy.
4. This is very socialistic idea - to add inflation tax and fund mining from it instead of users paying for service (transactions) they get.
5. As with every socialistic idea there is space for corruption - if transaction does not cost me anything I can do as much as I want without thinking about any optimizations, and I am sure there will be many way to misuse Grin. may be it will be network load, may be excessive splitting resulting in huge UTXO - I do not know. But I know that whenever appears something that can be created without paying some "smart" people will find a way to get gains from everyone else's losses.

First two or three years blocks were essentially empty so yes, it is fast to check them.
As for trustlessness - as far as I know in bitcoin you cannot get "half-trust", you really need to check all blocks to build UTXO set in usable form. And if this was possible and such method become widespread (exactly for reasons you mentioned) than creation of fake images would be guaranteed and then everyone would be forced to return to full checking anyway.
By the way if you do not need trustlessness you can use light wallet or (even worse) custodial solutions. Node without full checking is useless for the network anyway.

Conceptually this is easy. You remove taxes and introduce actual service fees for actual services. The only problem is that you do not have "welfare state" anymore, but some of us (including me) would be more than fine with this. There are many details that would need to be taken care of (for example police as service is simple), but current system also has lots of such "details".

It can theoretically monitor all activity but usually it scans "points of interest" and not all open documents. As for clipboard - password that was put into clipborad will leak of course, but passwords that were in that file and was not put into clipboard probably will not leak.

As for military - I do not have ready answer. Still somehow right now military forces with all their guns have not turned everyone into their slaves.
As for police - not "wealthy", but if nobody payed for service fee in advance (look at it as insurance fee - it does need to be large if it is regular) and nobody is willing to pay full price for prosecution - yes, there will be no case.
As for "Police and courts are not profitable" - right now they are not. Still I do not see why they could not be - for example private investigation companies exist right now. This is all about the expectations - what you expect to be done by government is different from what I expect - but I said this in my first comment - this is not "welfare state", you get only what you paid for.

First, we are still yet to see real useful applications for powerful smart contracts. Theoretically it is nice thing, but in practice? And need for scripting language to be turing-complete is very questionable in itself.
Second, a big plus of this "another layer" would be that it is not consensus based as consensus is already there in bitcoin blockchain. So, first  it would be able to evolve much faster, which will help eliminate any scripting problems. Second, it will not be target for just about anyone like ethereum - if you and me are running some specific application attacker first needs to know about it at all and then they will need to be able to enter into same activity - which does not need to be open for all. Also even if some of specific solutions will get hacked - it is not that big deal, as it will not suddenly make everyone vulnerable.
So it seems for me that bitcoin's simple blockchain + ln as transaction capacity/speed multiplier + many specific solutions for specific needs is a best way to go that will win any competition with "generic" complex blockchain.

As for type selection screen line "Less secure wallet" about desktop wallets... less secure in comparison to what? Definitely not to web wallet, and if you compare to mobiles it is still open question, as many android mobiles are vulnerable due to absence of updates and iOS does not allow to really install software you want - only that from store. Also Google or Apple can forcefully remove any application from your mobile which can really happen at any time, just like crypto ads were forbidden.
Also "desktop wallet" includes "Linux desktop wallet" which is secure enough.

May be it is easier but I never saw nor heard malware doing this. Copying "My documents" and other obvious locations - yes. Copying contents of clipboard - sometimes. Encrypt for bounty - sure. But not monitoring frequently used documents. Also there is much variety. It can be something in one of zillion note-taking or todo apps, it may be text document which is opened not in notepad but in some other editor - from Far Manager's internal editor to vim. The point is that it is much less defined target and hackers tend to concentrate on things that have best chance to give something interesting.
By the way there is another curious example of "safe but crazy" - password list written on paper that is stuck to display. Which can be very secure arrangement under some circumstances.
Still what I would use is Linux + full-disk encryption + password manager including integrated into browser. No master password (it will add nothing to full dusk encryption) and no antivirus (there is almost no malware that can survive on Linux or more exotic systems). There are other measures, of course - surprise or two newer hurt.
Also security measures really depend on use case - for example I tend to ignore 2FA for exchanges - mostly because I don't have any money there anyway and on exchanges which I use nothing bad will happen to me even if someone gets hold of my empty account. In FIDO form I would probably use it much more actively though.
edit: there is no problem at all in "successfully compromising a password manager". just download database as is and send master password next when it is entered (which is monitored trivially).

If my numbers are right it would cost about $0.05 per transaction without any batching right now (assuming 3sat/b cost as mempool is empty now, and 300b transaction size - i.e. about 1000sat per transaction). Segwit would reduce it even more.

It can of course. But it cannot automatically scan your PC and find it, and even if you open this file and copy password from it to paste into browser most probably it will not steal all content of that txt file, so only one password will leak.
But most popular password managers are specifically targeted so when malware gets master password all your saved passwords will leak, same for passwords saved in browser.

Actually THIS would be dumb decision. If I had bitcoins on mtgox I definitely would be against it because I probably would not be able to buy about 1/5 of bitcoins I had before with money from selling these coins - with this sum price would not be high on this auction - but public market would react much less so price would be higher, especially because I would not get money immediately.
Probably it would be best to proportionally distribute remaining coins between mtgox creditors. The could then sell them when and where they want. If it is possible is another matter entirely.

They will run into another problems - first being the need to exchange, i.e. take into account exchange rates etc. Consensus will be the second problem - it will mean that either it will be hard to upgrade logic or there will be some centralized decision making mechanism. With LN there is much more leeway. And miners will be another actor with their own set of interests and incentives, we already saw how it is bad enough in bitcoin. Then if you are talking about something like Grin with permanent inflation - there will be Grecham's law - while bitcoin on LN is still equal in value to bitcoin other coin will be cheaper because user will want to get rid of it, exchanging to deflationary bitcoin. I would expect that it will cause additional price fluctuations. Also there are some techical questions like need to be more ro less permanently online to have recent state while in LN it is possible to limit online presense (epecially when we get eltoo).
On the other side LN has only one real problem - and it is worked on with multipath etc -  limited channel capacity. With enough funds in network and better infrastructure (like exchanges where you can buy bitcoin to LN) it will not be problem even with current implementation.

As for me - I saw too many good projects that died because their authors wanted to do everything ideally while even half-baked approach worked and was useful. I really think LN needs MVP - really minimal and very limited set of cases that will allow to use it as money without fear that tomorrow fees will rise and your business model will die or you won't be able to buy next cup of coffee the way you used to. At least to show the market that "bitcoin scales, everithing is good".

Of course I know that all LN implementations are "formally" in pre-alpha. But what this really means? I do not see many complains here that people lost money on mainnet (I remember only one - and it was not about lost money), so I' beginning to question what this "pre-alpha" means - risks of losing money or stalled transactions (and how often?) or lack of planned features. If it's features - than why should I care? I am interested in only one feature right now - scalable transactions on top of base Bitcoin networks. Everything else can be added later. Or not added at all for all I care.
And yes, I do not know what's happening with lnd.

Some of them harmless but exotic (tonal system, really?), some are matter of personal preference ("Restore ability to display addresses in GUI", RBF default value) and some require additional investigation like "Drop IO priority to idle while reading blocks for getblock requests" which, if I understand it correctly, is somewhat drastic and was rejected from Core for a reason.
Unfortunately it takes a time to understand actual meaning of these patches and reasons behind rejection - probably several days for someone not familiar with Core development even just following discussions without digging in actual code. Also I'm not sure if current list of patches is up to date, some like "Enable various p2sh-p2wpkh functionality  seem obsolete

Well, suffixes are easy and they do not require to change mental model when price goes up or down if basic unit is small enough. And, as was said before, half of the world is used to large numbers, and with growing bitcoin price they will only decrease with time. The last thing I would want is to return to this discussion when bitcoin gains more value and is well-established.
Suffixes like 100k allow you to get rid of multiple zeros and do not force to choose some artificial denominations that can become obsolete. 
If bitcoin reaches $100k 1 satoshi will be equal 0.1 cent, while practical minimal value would be 10 times more (1sat = 1 cent), I can live with this.

First, about voting - probably most of the bitcoin's benefits are exactly because it is predictable and nobody can change it's behaviour on a whim. As for voting for inflation - you already have it on elections, is it nice that now we have an alternative.
Second, I see nothing wrong in buying because you need/want something and not because money literally burn in your hands.
Third, as for being alive  - that, apart from covering basic need have little to do with buyng things and much to do with the way of thinking. For example, I do not have a car - I can afford it but just do not need it.
Fourth, I see too much garbage goods and too few quality ones. I actually would be happy to see some cleanup.

And why exactly should we care about something obsolete like these "locally owned retail stores"? I would understand if you mentioned some less centralized alternative, but truth is that you cannot have efficient logistics on small scale. And if choice is between buying locally made garbage (because in particular place there is no competition) and access to wide specter of quality from different suppliers I know what I prefer. This is especially true for niche goods.

It depends on ecosystem. With enough actors participating in LN bitcoins you have in channels will be "usable", and on-chain would be something like cold wallet. And you would probably never close your channels, refilling them directly from exchanges.

No, what they sold was some new model of behaviour or new services - be it mobile communications, online purchases or online advertising. And they suffered because people was not ready for these new things. This is exactly what happens with bitcoin.
Actually it's bitcoin advantage that it does not have "old-style" assets - there is no need to support them, so it has much better chance to survive during hard times. At most we will see hash rate decrease for some time but it does not really affect things, and there are enough  people who got enough money to continue development for a long time.
As for "great economy" - it's a topic for separate discussion but bitcoin does not exactly depend on great economy - it will work just the same in recession and if you remember Greece (or Venezuela) when things are going bad people remember about bitcoin.

What is done in IT in these cases (for example when you are partitioning hard drive) - software accepts suffixes. So you could write 100k for 100000 or 1000k (or 1m) for 1000000. It's easy for both for developers and users.
Another example - calendars that allow text input - 1w 3d and 10d will be equal.

Well, I for one think that your "forced ethic" is not good idea and I prefer to not create targets for zealots (and you seem like one).
The truth is, people are not required to be "good" in according to someone else's opinion, and forced transparency makes those who does not agree with some views target for radical bearers of those views. And nowadays with social networks it became quite easy to inspire frenzy against someone or something.
As for governments - they will find a way to abuse their power anyway, the only option is to limit their power.

First, I do not like go.
Second, it's different things to somewhat understand syntax and to write efficient and idiomatic code.
Third, I do not like lnd approach very much - it seems they are planning to be in pre-release forever, Blockstream seems to be a bit more aggressive, and estimate "3-5 years" is definitely too much
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:24:11
What I meant is that people tend to defend their decisions,  as I said this is pretty well known fact. So those who bought bitcoins will be more inclined to say this was good idea.
What exactly increasing premium you are talking about? I see more and more businesses accepting bitcoin as is, and with improving user experience (and many companies are working on this) it will be even easier. 
Second, if (more like when) price will rice again they will probably appreciate owning bitcoins.
Third, if (again - probably when, not if) there will another serious problem like in Greece affected people will switch to bitcoin.
There are many advantages for doing business using bitcoin, for customers and for businesses, especially over internet and in "third world", there I expect some adoption too - but probably when services like btcpay and auto-selling accounts on exchanges are better.
And even putting all this aside - bitcoin grows for ten years, and environment was never more friendly than now, when countries starting to be friendly (Japan, Australia, Switzerland, now Germany to count a few). Why would it stop growing now?

She is very cautious, I think Blockstream will get at least basic version in the wild much faster (as they already did really). And for scaling we really need only basic features, everything else can be added later, even it will mean closing and reopening channels - it's not a big deal.
Schnorr is another matter - it is change to basic layer, so of course it cannot be done in parts. But Lightning is separate layer, anything from incompatible implementations to limited functionality can be tolerated to some extent.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:48:21
Depends on setup. If this is "highly connected node" then usual tricks can be used - RAID, remote machine and so on (probably they will be used anyway).
For individual user I would just backup into cloud - literally "encrypt and save into dropbox/google drive/anything", easily implemented and pretty secure for this case. It would work even on smartphone. I can easily invent several other approaches. All in all this is very easy to solve problem.
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:52:23
Dapps are not known for their speed, and LN is all about many instant transactions. So I doubt it will help - you would either end up with not latest transaction or (if properly implemented) it will limit your transaction rate.
What I would suggest first is good old continuous backup - probably it is some standard interface and connectors to different services - from own server to cloud storage, which is fast enough. May be DAPPS too if traffic allows it. Using encryption of course. For large nodes this is definitely way to go.
Another way would be to "propose current state" to your peer and have him either confirm it or to send to you what they think current state is (they have transaction you've sent to them). If I am not mistaken as LN currently uses HD generation you could re-create everything. There are some obstacles like limiting spam possibilities, but it's easy to overcome them (say, limit each peer to 1 request per hour). And with watchtowers they probably would be used in this way too.

Doing things in small increments helps. Actually this is how it is done now anyway, just market sees only  result of many such steps

Then don't, nobody is forcing you. With bitcoin you have some motivation to save, as it was with gold by the way, but how much to save/spend is up to you. Actually this is one of the reasons why I do not expect really catastrophic scenarios - people already have spending habits, it will not change overnight.
Actually it would be nice if someone would be able to add some numbers in this "deflationary bitcoin" discussion - USD inflation rate, "economic growth" rate, are they connected or not and so on. As far as I can remember these number are not that big, so I'm wondering if it can cause any real changes at all.
By the way we need to distinguish bitcoin's deflationary nature from price growth due to adoption. Because right now bitcoin is actually inflates - and probably faster than USD, although with decreasing rate.

If this is about MCU used in HW wallets I would not be really concerned. It is general-purpose MCU which is used way way more in rather boring things (and ratio is probably like 1:1000000 or so). Also due to volumes these chips are made to be as cheap as possible, so there is no room to add something complicated without losing competitive advantage.
Also (and this is relevant to closed-source secure element which is much more tempting target for adding backdoor) if they are designed and produced in China and you are are not in China chances for Chinese government to get access (and to be interested in getting access) to your HW wallet is extremely low. So I do not see any real threat scenario there. Unfortunately most HW wallets are used outside of Chine (US mostly) and secret elements are at least designed in US (for example aforementioned ATECC508A from Microchip).
By the way Bloomberg was unable to give any proofs about this supposed incident but this is another matter entirely, at least such infiltration can be theoretically done.

Do you see anybody arguing with that? This post is not about usefulness of HW as a whole, only  about closed-source ones.
@_date: 2019-09-06 07:21:33
What is more, even if you trust HW wallet producer you also need to trust a secure element producer - and secure element is an attractive target for placing backdoors by manufacturer as it is designed to store secrets - no matter which, and it's use is much more widespread than (still very niche) usage of bitcoin.

In Ukraine "legalization" can mean anything. As far as I can tell what they want mostly is control over exchanges, information on cryptocurrency owners and heavy taxes.

Most businesses do not run own nodes,  using payment processors like BitPay instead, nothing changes here, and processors are definitely able to run LN nodes. We already saw alpha Coinbase-LN gateway demo.
Other then that - first, just give it a time. Probably some ready-to-use distribution will emerge, may be even before Lightning will be declared production ready. Second, there are more and more technical specialist that can do this, and it will be even better in future, probably it will be just part of standard package for them to not just set up PayPal integration for e-businesses but bitcoin and LN as well. If there is one more service to sell - it will be sold if there is enough hipe around it.

It really depends on threat model. The basic idea of hardware wallet is to protect from online threats, and both will work fine in this regard (USB is not THAT weak to expect any big vulnerabilities).

Why the hell do you want your purchase of coffee to be forever recorded in blockchain?
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:25:08
It depends. 
Basically you would need to open channel, yes. But there is a difference between "high fees for buying a cup of coffee" and "high fees to put $500 in channel", and after channel is opened there is no need to close it as long as you can have it replenished from somewhere - like buying bitcoins or getting paid for your services directly to your channel. So with good enough infrastructure I can imagine that channels would almost never be closed and reopened/ There some ideas in development which would allow to lower cost of channel opening closing (channel factories, MAST and so on) but even with what we have now it is not that tight.

for all of this you do not need eternal storage - you can use Lighning. But if you want - by all means, you can. Probably even 0-conf will work for coffee. You will pay for it of course, or sigh about "wanted when the mempool was congested".
If you want to go to supermarket on a truck - do not expect it to be cheap, but some people still do not get that blockchain is a truck, not bicycle - it is not cheap. Those who realized it invented Lightning which does not force every full node on the Earth to download, verify and store forever every cup-of coffee transaction.

Are you really suggesting to "go mainstream and then add second layer"?
Also only blockchains I can see that currently have comparable traffic are ETH and XRP. ETH blockchain is of pretty unmanageable size and XRP is entire matter entirely with it's centralized nature and lack of any privacy by design (users are encouraged to reuse addresses).
Also going with low fees and big clocks is an obvious step in direction of adding some kind of inflation - because with subsidy decrease miners will want it and with huge blockchain there will not be enough active full nodes to stop it like it was done with UASF to 2X.

Probably no government is crazy enough to replace fiat money it controls with bitcoin. You really need to be isolated from global economy to do this as the world economy is revolving around spending, inflation, GDP increase and so on.
For bitcoin to be successful as national currency too much needs to be changed in the ways that are not compatible with what is currently deemed as "right thing to do" - tax collection (bitcoin is easy to hide), expenses (including welfare-related) and so on.
