I thought Silk Road was all peace and love and shit. 
All these nice friendly non violent people making the world a better place. 
Now i read about murdering people and drug cartels. I'm shocked! I bet this is all fake. This must be coming from cia shill trying to make Bitcoin druggies look bad. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:25:31
I sometimes think i accidentally ended up at an Alex Jones site. 
And it seems to get worse every day. The worse Bitcoin does the more nutters post here. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:00:59
It is. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 14:11:53
And Bitcoin is known for being so extremely easy to get and use. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:05:51
I bet it was a Bitcoiner. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 15:05:51
Is there anything ever not relevant to Bitcoin here?
@_date: 2014-10-22 13:21:56
This doesn't change anything to my story. 
The security the confirmation gives is one of the things everyone raves about. Don't tell me now it's not important, store owners don't need it, store owners won't use it. 
Everyone is giving cc's and checks shit because of how insecure they are. Bitcoin obviously is a solution. Confirmations are. And now you suggest people shouldn't use it?
And please don't be that dork that will tell me cc's take 6 months to confirm. If i pay with a cc i can leave the store 30 seconds later. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 23:52:42
I wish we wouldn't get 20 of these post every time the price drops. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:25:19
Because the price doesn't matter, right?
@_date: 2014-10-26 20:00:01
You are at the right place for drugs and money laundering advice. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 14:46:57
I'll just explain it again. Sigh. 
I realize it's not needed for the majority of most transactions. That still leaves us with 1000's of transaction that store owner are gonna want 1 confirmation for. 
I see this excuse over and over. Basically you are saying who cares about the 1000's of people who will need to wait in the store after paying. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 12:18:41
You should know as you put it there?
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:35:05
Life for you kids must be so simple. 
People afraid of credit card fraud? Bitcoin. 
Country goes bankrupt? Bitcoin. 
Cure aids? Bitcoin. 
In your fantasy world there is only one alternative to pretty much anything and that is Bitcoin. 
Your simplistic view on life is just so clueless. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:03:11
Not really no. Maybe you can explain it to me?
@_date: 2014-10-25 12:42:45
Since you are starting the same thread every day may i suggest the mods to ban your troll ass. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:03:50
Ah. So Ross hiring a hitman is the governments fault.
And who cares he tried to murder someone, right. He sold drugs so he is your hero. And drug selling heroes are innocent by default. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:11:50
How long did you search?
@_date: 2014-10-28 09:58:04
I'm not here to inform on you. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 13:07:01
Are you 15 or what?
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:11:13
I can't find anything about Bitcoin in the article. Can you point it out please?
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:52:57
As i've been saying for a while now, that guy is insane!
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:52:41
Calm down kiddo. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 10:55:15
Every time we go down the price suddenly isn't important anymore. Hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 11:13:55
Yes of course. 
Either a person who bought at the top and now doesn't know what to do anymore and asking advice or a banker shill. 
Well, obviously it has to be a banker shill then. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:10:06
I'm sure the op will find a way how this is relevant to Bitcoin. They always do. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 18:30:53
I once paid someone in fiat. Took me 1 second. Then i sent a Bitcoin to a site. I had to wait 40 minutes. 
Fiat is 2400 times faster. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:13:29
It's spam. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:28:30
Get real. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 23:55:10
"five have fallen off the table and the sixth sits untouched in a separate indictment (legalese for an unproven allegation) that was purposefully left out of the upcoming trial."
Because it's in another state at another trial. Why can't they just type that instead of making it look like some cover up. 
So yes, he is still being charged with hiring a hitman. 
But i guess mentioning facts makes you an asshat and is like playing a broken record or something?
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:10:37
Welcome to People like the topic starter are young, drug users, anti government and often completely paranoid. Ross is their druggie hero, he is innocent and everything the fbi says is a lie. That's the fantasy world they live in. Anyone talking facts and reality quickly gets downvoted. They absolutely hate it when that happens. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 11:02:34
Yes impossible. We all know that everyone who buys a coin right away away opens an account on Reddit. Every single person. 
Most logical explanation is a cia shill. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:19:51
Use some commeon sense. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:27:34
Yeah, you'd almost think this place is filled with young kids who hate the government and smoke weed all day. You know, the same kind of people you will find on a Alex Jones forum. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 14:48:43
Because nobody uses it. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 08:36:43
You should start a thread explaining that and watch the biggest downvote circle jerk to ever occur on Reddit. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:38:47
Everyone keeps telling me 0 confirmations is perfectly fine. 
So every one should start using 1 confirmation? I'm sure that will work out well. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:53:46
Sure. This is the big one. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:50:19
When people who didn't watch the rise and rise of Bitcoin left negative comments everyone here went nuts.
Now you are asking Bitcoiners to do the same thing about a book they didn't read.
Yes, it's pretty clear that book is shit but just don't spam that site with cringey shit that makes us look the way he probably describes us in his book. He most likely has a good point there.
If you read it then leave a honest review.
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:06:33
Probably buying a new car. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:39:17
Sure. No way here anybody would seriously believe. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:58:48
So 3 hours later not 1 name? How is that possible?
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:00:34
You got downvoted. Because obviously it's not possible what you said. They have to be paid shills. Nothing else possible. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:40:09
He called a guy who bought at 1000 and asked if he should sell now a banker shill a few says ago. 
Edit: can the person who downvoted this comment explain to me why?
There is nothing to like or dislike, nothing to offend, not even an opinion. 
It's just a fact, an observation. Why would you possibly downvote this?
@_date: 2014-10-25 08:45:47
Can you show us the evidence that these cia shills are trying to make Ross look bad. 
You apparently have this pretty clear evidence so please show us. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:24:06
You sure got the fantasy of Stephen King. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:57:54
And did they sent it?
@_date: 2014-10-27 10:54:07
You are asking why we simply shouldn't manipulate the prices so your 0.5 coin will be worth more. 
Nothing amazes me anymore here. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:40:36
When people who didn't watch the rise and rise of Bitcoin left negative comments everyone here went nuts.

@_date: 2014-10-28 09:58:55
You want a tissue with that?
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:04:53
Don't be stupid. What happened with the 100k? Did they pay it? Are they supposed to pay it. What about the 100k?
You say "already 100k". Can you understand that for someone who doesn't understand Italian "already 100k" means nothing?
@_date: 2014-10-25 08:08:45
Yeah. A few broke kids in the Bitcoin subreddit do. But i bet he's spamming random people with 5 cents here and 10 cents there. It's absolutely worthless to them. Noone is gonna figure all that shit out just to claim a few cents. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 15:02:36
Another day, another cringe. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 19:45:36
Don't be suprised if someone will call you a banker shill. The last person who said the same thing got accused of being one. Yes really. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 22:23:23
You could use the search and read one of the 200 existing topics that answer that question. But screw that right, just start your own topic. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:56:12
Fiat. It's faster, easier, safer and won't lose value as fast. You also have less chance of companies dissapearing with your money and being scammed left and right. Oh and people might actually accept it. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 07:22:59
"Fincancually literate"
@_date: 2014-10-22 15:08:42
Good luck. The subject is forbidden here. Even asking about it is guaranteed to be a downvote hell. 
Exactly this behavior shows most people realize this is a huge problem. And in Bitcoin land we simply act like it doesn't exist. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:15:05
I think it is the same guy as last year and was told the same thing. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 08:28:35
And when i mention this and how it will be a huge problem if Bitcoin would go mainstream i get downvoted to oblivion because "0 confirmation transactions are perfectly safe and store owners won't need 1 confirmation". 
So what is it? Perfectly safe or not?
@_date: 2014-10-25 08:36:10
Trying to have someone killed is a crime, you know. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 11:02:17
No. I wait till the trial is over before i accept anything. Unlike people like you who will claim Ross is innocent simply because he is your druggie hero. 
Funny how you accuse me of things you do yourself. 
And blaming the government for Ross having to hire a hitman...it's so retarded i'm not even gonna discuss it. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 07:11:38
Amazing how that scumbag just continues his life like nothing happened. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:57:58
Absolutely. Someone like him should be perma banned. Threats, racism, you name it. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:47:37
Karma? Seriously?
@_date: 2014-10-28 01:21:40
And how exactly are they gonna do that?
@_date: 2014-10-27 12:15:45
You just want to believe that because if it did exist then the last price rise was fake. And the cultists here sure wouldn't like that, would they?
@_date: 2014-10-21 20:44:51
Can you please point out 1 paid banker shill?
Should be easy since this place apparently is filled with them. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 20:29:26
Cringe story of the day. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 10:00:35
Why would anybody downvote this?
@_date: 2014-10-22 23:31:09
Apparently you and many other people since every second post here is about Apple pay. 
They sure get a lot of attention for something nobody cares about. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 10:40:37
"Cia paid"
You can't be serious. 
You really are saying that most people here who said something negative about Ross based on the fact that he is charged with hiring a hitman were paid cia shills. 
Stop smoking weed for a few hours and try to understand what you are saying and how completely retarded it looks. 
And the fact that you got upvoted 10 times says a lot about the type of people who visit this sub. Sad. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:18:23
Best proof ever. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 07:06:54
Hilarious all those downvotes. Reality hurts i see. 
"Apple pay suuuucks!" Yet this whole sub is filled with Apple pay news. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 08:48:51
Of course you do. You share the same fantasy world. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 22:20:52
Affecting must be the most difficult word in the English language for some reason. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:32:14
If Bitcoin was added to that listed it probably did worse than credit cards. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 09:56:20
And what if the price of a coin went up or down 100 dollars by the time you are gonna refund it?
@_date: 2014-10-28 09:37:52
You seem very insecure. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 13:52:32
And that obviously means they are in this sub downvoting the op. Correct?
Apples exist. That's proof that i own apples. Yes, this is really your logic. I can't even believe you were being serious. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 04:37:26
I hope people here can give it a honest vote instead of a 10 just because you love Bitcoin. 
I doubt it. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 07:58:46
Nobody cares about your 10 cents. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 12:18:17
Yes. Totally occam's razor. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 21:01:45
It's because Bitcoin is far superior and nobody gives a shit about Apple pay. That's why it's all they talk about. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:34:00
Oh shit. You found out! I better start using a new nick soon. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 13:05:07
This is the most sexist thing i've eeeeeeever seen! I'm soooo offended!
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:38:41
My coins are worth more than you will make working the next 5 years. I think i'm doing just fine. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 13:20:48
He is downvoted = proof of cia shills. 
Only on @_date: 2014-10-21 22:00:34
@_date: 2014-10-21 05:16:38
You are right. The average person doesn't care about all the Bitcoin stuff. They just want to be able to pay simple and fast. They don't care if a bank is involved or if it's based on an old system. It simply works for them. 
Bitcoin needs something like this before it can become mainstream. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 16:45:12
Because it's an extremely small niche market. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 09:58:54
Uh no. Bigger things have failed. Much bigger things. Use some common sense. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:03:56
If you're in a vehicle going the speed of light, what happens when you turn on the headlights?
@_date: 2014-10-28 08:30:23
Right, because someone who buys a new hat is really gonna wait up to a hour in a store after paying. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:44:21
No. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 21:07:15
People seriously worry about these things?
@_date: 2014-10-21 17:41:07
99% sure he didn't watch it. 
It's amazing the deep hatred people have against something that doesn't affect their life at all. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:08:55
The lower the price goes the more desperate they get here. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:20:06
In the meantime you are getting upvoted by the cultists who actually believe this. 
This place is insane. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:32:48
Ah yes. More "proof" that those people here are paid shills. 
What a fucked up life you must have. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:17:21
What the hell are you talking about. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 13:55:02
@_date: 2014-10-27 10:50:59
I'll just keep asking it. Maybe one day i will get an answer. 
Since this place is apparently filled with paid cia and banker shills can you point out just 1 of them and provide at least some evidence. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:50:27
Bit con. How original. You think he made it up all by himself?
@_date: 2014-10-27 21:15:47
He has some serious issues yes. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 22:14:58
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:48:26
Because it works easier than Bitcoin and the potential amount of customers is way bigger. 
Edit: i see i'm getting downvoted. Fine with me but just be polite enough to at least explain why. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 08:41:40
How does this possibly make sense?
Is this another one of those "cia shills exist so that's proof they are posting here" theories?
Let me get this straight. According to you it's more likely that the people who talk negative about Ross are cia shills than people who simply don't like Ross and the things he possibly did?
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:44:47
No, they're not scared. Stop repeating that nonsense. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:48:07
You really are far, far into fantasy land. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:34:06
Goddamn, i'm exposed again! You people are so fucking clever!
I had to realize only a shill would ask for proof. I'm so stupid!
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:25:12
Impossible. They have to be paid shills. No other possibility. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 11:57:57
Another alt coin scam. Who cares. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:30:22
Take a guess. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 08:02:57
You also think that a guy who bought at 1000 and wants to get out is a shill. 
So i'm pretty sure you are mentally retarded. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:54:13
Yes but what about it?
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:23:24
Because you just made that up or because you have proof?
@_date: 2014-10-22 14:50:47
And how is that comment from bankerfrombtc a troll post? Because he says something you don't agree with?
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:13:53
He is still being charged for hiring a hitman and many other things. You know for a fact that he is innocent already? 
@_date: 2014-10-24 13:18:30
Since this place is filled with banker and cia paid shills could you be so nice to point out one of them. Just one, that's all i ask. Shouldn't be too hard as there are so many of them. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:27:53
The lower we get the more of these posts we see. 
These stoned paranoid kids need to find a reason why their 0.3 coin is becoming worth less. And who other to blame than banks, the fbi, the government and the tons of cia shills here who talk the price down or something. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 09:25:03
You should look up what a charge back is. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:21:45
Check your topic title again. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 00:04:52
Please stop with this shit. We got it. Bitcoin is like the early internet. We got it the first 200 times it was posted. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 21:01:38
All the ridiculous clichés combined in 1 post. Thanks for the cringe. 
Yes, there are plenty of trolls here but cultists like you aren't exactly what Bitcoin needs either. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:40:17
Already 100k what?
@_date: 2014-10-23 22:18:49
Another one of these posts? Really?
@_date: 2014-10-22 13:06:41
Because most of the time isn't good enough. 
Like it or not in the real world many store owners are gonna want 1 confirmation if they sell something expensive. 
That's what the security is for right? That's what confirmations are for, right? 
We all want Bitcoin to go mainstream. Even if it's 1/10th there that will mean 1000's of transactions a day that are gonna need 1 confirmation. 
Which results in 1000's of people in shops waiting anywhere from 5 minutes to 1 hour for their payment to go through. 
Even 5 minutes guaranteed won't work. That simply doesn't go hand in hand with going mainstream. Credit cards, bank card, cash, they all work instantly. People won't change to something that takes 5 minutes. Let alone up to 1 hour.
I realize i will be downvoted to oblivion since the transaction time problem is a taboo here. That is fine with me but when you downvote at least tell me where exactly i'm wrong. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 13:19:43
It obviously has nothing to do with his topic title and invalid facts. 
No, it's because of all the cia shills downvoting him. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 08:31:47
Well, i guess that's how interested people outside this sub are in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 04:23:28
I cringed. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 16:43:12
Right.
