The interest in mining was more "this shits cool how does it work", If I sell the rig I will turn that straight into a bitcoin purchase. 
I was mainly looking at it since I picked up the machine yesterday and didn't need it, but I feel a bit like Special Ed shouting "I got Bitcoin, yay!" on my quest to see if I can convert it to mine.
I do pay the power bill, but my usage from 10pm-6am is free.

thanks! I should have been more thorough going through the sidebar

Zero expectation of riches, the fun side of it is what interests me. Great point on the heat, end of winter is probably not the best time to setup hardware.

Yes! the learning and insight is what most interests me, this stuff is fascinating. I'm not in any need for cashflow, I just want to peek under the hood and see it working.
I'll start looking for gpu/cpu specific coins, thanks!

I'm self employed, please enlighten me how to successfully steal from myself at a profit! :p

Thanks, just started reading up on the alternate coins, I never realized there were so many -

I'm a contractor out of a home office and my electric plan is free from 10PM to 6AM. I set it up after getting an electric car for nightly charging.
Yes new to btc, probably very evident from the question :) I always wanted to get into it but I work 70 hour weeks on average so there is never time. Losing one of my clients has freed me up on time though.

Not a lease, I own my home and run a business out of it, and electricity is free from 10pm to 6am on my current electric contract. If I run a miner at those hours, and am able to use this hardware for it, then I don't end up losing money in my exploration of mining because its a $0 investment.
However it sounds like this hardware is a no go.

I'm thinking its probably better to sell the rig, buy a single asic miner for the "ooh lets check out this whole mining thing" part of my brain, and put the rest in a bitcoin purchase.
