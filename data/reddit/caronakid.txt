Difficulty retarget?

I tried that, my ticket was ignored three separate times so I gave up. Quit trying to act like Cryptsy does everything they can to help their customers, they are a horrible dishonest company and will eventually be prosecuted when they finally  fuck with the wrong person.

I had over $1000 USD in Cryptsy and was inactive for over 3 months in some alt coins and they took my coins citing that I was inactive for too long and they closed my balance. Cryptsy is a horrible website that takes advantage of its users whenever they can. One of the operators, Big Vern ran a porn site before Cryptsy. It's called Cryptsy because that's where your Cryptocoin investments go to die.

I'll go ahead and open a ticket through the usual channel and see if suddenly something will be done about it.  Not to mention because they were Altcoins they aren't worth a fraction of what they were worth when I was attempting to sell the first time.

Aren't we forgetting to factor in competition from other crypto-currencies such as LTC, which appears to be catching up to BTC slowly but surely?
**The future value of BTC will be affected by this and it must be taken into consideration**
I would love to hear reddit's thoughts on this!
