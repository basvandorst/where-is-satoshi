No.  No, I'm not willing.  
Because, first of all, define "need."  I may not need something today, but I might feel more comfortable having it for later.  I "need" extra resources to feel secure.
I'm not the only person who feels this way.  Hence, you'll never get everyone on board for the socialist program.  Ever.
Also, even in the very best situation, you can't redistribute resources without a person or persons making decisions about what resources go where etc.  Automatically, you're giving power to a group of people and withholding that power from everyone else.  That's hierarchy.  Redistribution without hierarchy is impossible, hence socialism is not anarchistic.
Anarcho-capitalism is based on emergent processes.  No government or hierarchical system invented money.  Money emerged as a solution to the coincidence of needs problem in the barter system.  No government or hierarchical system invented markets.  Markets emerged to facilitate trade. 
People need things and trade makes it so people can get those things.  Capitalism is about the process of filling needs in a way that is beneficial to both participants in a transaction.  Capitalism needs no government, hierarchy or oppression to exist.  Capitalism emerges from mankind's social instinct.  In an anarchist society capitalism would be taken for granted.

I know right.  Tulips, so clever.

so should I report my passport stolen or what?

Because I don't want to rely on other people for my basic needs.  People are imperfect and make mistakes.  When it comes to my life and survival, I'd rather rely on myself.  Besides, I'm way more motivated to take care of myself than other people are.
See, there's another flaw in socialism.  It doesn't take human nature into account.

I don't think that's correct.  My understanding is that there is some sort of legal process where some creditors are paid, and a lawsuit is a means to making a claim against what money is available.
Nicer user name btw.

When I was in the journalism program at a lowly community college, misspelling a name was called a "gross factual error" and earned you an automatic F on your story.
I don't even work in journalism and to this day I have an obsessive-compulsive need to spell people's names correctly.
The WSJ could fire this guy and hire me in his place.  What an embarrassment.

roughly 8 BTC lost here.  I'm kind of not concerned about it.  I bought them quite a while ago, and don't even remember the amount of my total investment.
This isn't the first time I've been burned, either.  And every time I've put money into the bitcoin economy (whether USD or by selling merchandise) I've been semi-aware that I could be throwing it away.  Hence I never risked more than I might have spent on an expensive hobby.
I just wish I'd been able to get my btc out of gox when I had 10 and the going rate was 1k usd.  That could have been a nice vacation for me.
But then, at least I don't have to figure out the taxes.

Or a mixture of both.  This guy isn't perpetrating cold premeditated thievery, though.  He seems to only be massively unaware of the effects of his behavior.

My account was +$10000 for like a day or so and I can't get my data out of Mt. Gox.  God this is a headache.

in case no one's said it yet, search any and all hard drives for "wallet.dat"
this is just a starting point, though.  you want to read up on bitcoin as much as you can.  hopefully you have some aptitude with computers.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:44:19
Yes it did. Right after the government outlawed bad weather.

With that many coins you could start your own market. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:33:39
Yeah, all in PHP, too.

The price will stabilize. Remember, you only lose or gain when you sell. Don't make emotional decisions. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:32:24
What? Because I lost a real true fortune on that debacle. Where do you go for your updates?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:09
Halting trades ain't such a crazy idea: 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:06:32
Figure out a payment method and start slinging the things on reddit, facebook, wherever they'll let you.

If you're in crypto and don't know what MtGox is/was, you're playing with fire. That mess is like the prototype for everything that goes wrong in the crypto space. Tether got hacked and USDT is fake. Not surprised. That guy running that thing never really knew what he was doing. Yup. Coulda told you.
The world of cryptocurrencies is an insane maelstrom. You got to read everything you can, and learn something new every hour on the hour. And even then, assume you'll lose money on the occasional. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:51:36
Yes. Everybody fucking chill. This market is driven by emotion, and if we have a collective global freak out there's going to be Congressional hearings before the year's out. Fucking take it easy.

I can't get my 9.5 btc out of mt.gox  because I don't have any utility bills in my name.  
@_date: 2013-05-22 05:26:13
ASEs and Maple Leafs mostly.  Your site says they are delayed, which I interpreted to mean out of stock.
Is that correct?
@_date: 2013-05-21 01:50:01
I wish they had more inventory.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:13:38
Yeah, I read about one or two people doing this.  Maybe I'll try it, though last time I opened a graphics editing program was in the 1990s.
Up till now I was too lazy to even consider this option, but for ~$6000, it might be worth my time.

Can't even withdraw btc without proof of residency, now.  Or so it seems.
