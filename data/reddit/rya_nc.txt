Based on OP's post  I am very concerned about the security of this service.
First, let me quote BIP32:






If you have a parent public key and a child private key, **you can derive all child private keys from that parent**. It's difficult for me to tell if this would be an issue here as the other post is missing some important details.
Second, only "AES" is mentioned, not what mode of operation is used or how IVs are generated. It's possible to implement AES in ways that are trivial to break, and I've successfully cracked several AES implementations that were doing things wrong.
Third, RSA seems to be being used to directly encrypt data. This can result in "game over" security failures if not padded, and especially if "textbook RSA" is used. Generally RSA is used only to encrypt a random symmetric encryption key and mac key, and the actual data is encrypted with that.
Fourth, the constructions listed are just *weird*


Why are RSA signatures not being used here?
Fifth, "Out of band Bob and Alice compare hashes" people won't do this reliably unless forced to.
Sixth, the site can easily be modified to steal the decrypted private keys if compromised.

Check out this video on how Diffie-Hellman works.
An elliptic curve variant of this is used as part of the protocol.
Let me take some liberties with the notation.
So Bob's "long term" public key is _B_ and his private is _b_.
Alice generates a "throwaway" keypair, public _P_ and private _p_.
Alice computes _s_ as _p * B_. Bob would also be able to compute _s_ as _b * P_.
Here, I should note that elliptic curve keys, such as the ones Bitcoin uses, have an interesting property.
_Public(private1 + private2) = Public(private1) + Public(private2)_
Alice uses this property to create a new public key for Bob, _B'_ by adding using a hash of _s_ as a new private key and adding the public key to _B_.
_Public(Hash(s)) + B = B'_
Alice cannot get the private key for this, but Bob can:
_Hash(s) + b = b'_ and _Public(b') = B'_ 
Alice sends some Bitcoin to Bob by creating a transaction to _Address(B')_ and includes _P_ in the transaction. This transaction is a pay-to-stealth-address transaction. The tricky bit here is that Bob can't directly tell that this transaction is intended for him. He must try to compute
_Address(Public(Hash(b * P) + b))_
for all pay-to-stealth-address transactions that he sees in the hopes that one is for him. Fortunately this is a fast calculation that only takes Bob's computer a few thousandths of a second to do.
Does that help?

Why do you insist on calling hd wallet seeds brainwallets? It confuses people. Please stop.
A memorized hd wallet seed from electrum or a bip39 compatible wallet is fine, except for the risk of forgetting. If you don't trust the RNG, a bip39 seed can be generated with dice.


I disagree. If many people use a security product incorrectly, I think it is fair to say that product is flawed. We have safety standards in place to prevent many physical products that people can easily harm themselves or others with by mistake from being sold. My hope is that eventually things will catch up with security products.


Can you please explain how you would be less secure using BIP38 paper wallets that you've made multiple copies of? Perhaps one copy in your home safe, one copy at a family member's home, and one copy in a bank vault?


If you use a brainwallet, you publish your password hash for the world to crack. This is not true with your other examples - data has to be stolen before they can be attacked offline. In the case of email, there will be an authentication oracle, but it will be heavily rate limited.
FWIW, I think using email without 2FA is a terrible idea, and I wish more companies would make 2FA mandatory.


Unless I'm provided with enough information in advance to figure out the upper bound of my compute costs, I don't play these games. Even if I did, all it would prove is that *you* created a brainwallet that *I* can't crack *for what I'm willing to spend trying*. That said, I would consider it if you would like to fund my cracking research.


If you go back through the thread, you'll find that someone else said that, not me. I've merely argued that encouraging use of sha256 brainwallets is unconscionable, and that referring to anything else as a brainwallet is dangerously confusing. My supporting points for this have been made, I suggest you re-read those as well.
If I were to say that brainwallets could be made securely, someone will take that out of context.
@_date: 2017-01-17 15:15:18
It's possible to find the private key for a given public key much faster than brute force. In general, the security factor of a 2^n bit key is 2^(n/2). This doesn't mean it's broken, but doing significantly better than that would. A 112 bit key was [cracked in 2009]( by an academic group with over 200 Playstation 3 consoles. For comparison Bitcoin uses 256 bit keys, which are about a billion trillion times stronger than that.

@_date: 2016-06-12 15:49:47
Bitcoin mining scales in was that resource extraction does not. If the profit margin on mining is large, more miners will be added, making mining more difficult. This can be expected to continue until an equilibrium is reached. The block reward halvings are a factor here, but that's very long term.

There are other tools available that are dramatically more secure than sha256 brainwallets with no practical disadvantages, therefore there is no legitimate reason to advocate for sha256 brainwallets.
[WarpWallet]( has some... creative... design decisions, but it's at least sixty thousand times harder to crack. Even more if you use a salt. I still don't think it's a good idea, but it's clearly less bad. Literally the only downside is that it takes a few more seconds to generate the key.


Gmail doesn't publish the unsalted hash of everyone's password, so this is an apples and oranges comparison.


Those tools can and usually do have a password in addition to the thing that needs to be stolen. Having to steal something, then crack the password is harder than just having to crack the password.


Human brains are worse at more predictable than many bad RNGs.


Dude, my brainwallet cracker is up on github. Lots of people have lost money.


Does the trezor not have passphrase support? It's not fair to compare security of "perfect use". Just like contraceptives, security tools should be measured by "typical use".


Lots of passphrases have been cracked.


People forget stuff all the time even without head injury.


It doesn't matter because most people who think they understand entropy of password complexity do not.


Which is why tools that are secure under "typical use" are important. Brainwallets are abysmal under typical use.

Brainwallets using a million rounds of SHA256 would not be a million times harder to crack than a single round, only tens of thousands of times harder because computing the public keys is slow.
It's not clear what your definition of "bruteforce" is. If you are talking about systematically trying all possible character combinations of a given length, professional password crackers only do that for fairly short passwords even if they have hardware acceleration. Statistical models and attacks using dictionaries plus rules for modifying or combining entries are more effective.


Note that I haven't ever used a hardware wallet, so I'm not sure how "user friendly" they are, but one of those with a backup of the seed should do a good job of protecting anyone smart enough not to fall for scams.


You couldn't buy *any* brainwallet cracking ASICs for $100k. You'd probably have to spend close to [a million dollars]( to design and manufacture them. The starting point would be an FPGA design. You can just use an "off the shelf" design for the SHA256 part, but you'd need something custom optimized for bulk computing secp256k1 public keys, and there are not many people capable of designing that. RIPMD160 is also needed, but that is simpler. Once you have all that, you have to either deal with the bandwidth issues of getting candidate passwords onto the chip and getting keys off, or also implement those on-chip.
This just doesn't seem like a plausible method of attack when there's the option of using a botnet. This could change long term.
I am not aware of GPU code for computing secp256k1 public keys in bulk from private keys, either. Yes, I know about oclvanitygen, that is not what it does.


Scrypt is parameterized, and can be stronger or weaker depending on the parameters chosen. WarpWallet uses weaker parameters (N=2^(18), r=8, p=1) than that line (N=2^(20), r=8, p=1). Also note that this is the "cost of hardware to crack in one year" from 2009. This is a completely different figure from what you were arguing with me about. Today, it is trivially easy to rent a massive amount of computing hardware, which makes "cost per guess" a more relevant figure to compare on.


We are not even comparing against SHA256 speed. For SHA256 brainwallets, there are two ripemd160 operations, three sha256 operations, a secp256k1 base point multiplication and a secp256k1 public key format conversion. This is on the order of 100 times slower than a single MD5.

I am the one speaking in the video you reference. WarpWallet was mentioned for purposes of harm reduction. One of my regrets about that talk was not making that more clear. People have cracked "bait" wallets I've made with WarpWallet that had a salt plus simple password.
I am not sure how much more expensive WarpWallet is to crack since I haven't made a serious effort to benchmark it, but at best it's a million times. I'd guess hundreds of thousands. Part of the reason for this is that the elliptic curve operations are *much* slower than SHA256, and also do not seem to benefit as much from hardware acceleration.
**Edit** I went back and benchmarked it, on the same system I get 156k passwords/sec with sha256 brainwallets and 1.89 passwords/sec with warpwallet, so it's a factor of about 61k. **/Edit**
If someone wanted to attack WarpWallet, the way to do it would be to acquire email addresses from account database leaks on bitcoin related sites (I know the mtgox and bitcointalk databases are available) and use a botnet to try a list of passwords and passphrases against all of them. The average user is much less likely to get screwed in the process vs a sha256 brainwallet, but if WarpWallet were popular, odds are pretty good *someone* would choose something dumb.
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:27:04


Please read more carefully. I specifically said I wasn't sure what you meant and was guessing.


Different kind of "dumb". Yes, this is a risk.




You are comparing apples and oranges. I never said anything about hardware costs. The ratio of energy costs is more relevant because it will quickly exceed the hardware cost.




Dedicated hardware capable of doing bulk secp256k1 point multiplications and format conversions does not exist, nor am I aware of any designs for it. Thus, it's only possible to guess at hardware costs.
Quantitatively, WarpWallet is at least tens of thousands of times harder to crack than traditional brainwallets, but this does not make it "safe".


Assume xkcd style passphrases - four words, 2,048 word public dictionary, chosen using dice.
This is about 16 trillion possible passphrases. My best guess is that it would cost about 1 million dollars per trillion passphrases using AWS spot instances. This is 16 million dollars to check them all, assuming people use the default (empty) salt. Using a botnet should reduce that by a factor of 10 to 100, so perhaps as low as $160,000. This is an entirely feasible attack, even if I'm underestimating costs by a significant margin. Most people probably won't use passphrases this good.
**Edit** From running an actual benchmark, it's approximately $2.5 million per trillion warpwallet passphrases per salt, assuming you use AWS spot instances. A 1,000,000 node botnet could do it in a few months. **/Edit**


You might have a point, except that if you use WarpWallet, you have to figure out how to manage keys and unspent transactions correctly yourself. If you were to say, import the private key into Bitcoin Core, then spend part of it, the change would go to your wallet file with a new random address. If you're not expecting that, it could be a problem. Also, reusing addresses is generally considered a "bad idea".




If you don't trust the RNG, generate a BIP39 seed with dice and import that into the hardware wallet.


You have to trust some software to handle your transactions. I don't see how an offline computer is demonstrably safer.


Three words is not even slightly safe even with a salt. That you would even suggest that makes me think that you're either a scammer, a troll, or delusional (for some reason crazy people seem to love brainwallets), and this will be my last reply to you.




Most humans, even if able and instructed to do so, will not "choose 4 random words from a 10k dictionary, add a made up word and an email". They'll pick some words that they think *sound random* but are actually quite predictable.

Which time?
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:57:51
The number of possible private keys is 2^256 minus about 4.3 billion. The number of public keys is equal to the number of private keys. There are 2^160 possible P2PKH (pay to public key hash) addresses (these start with 1) and 2^160 P2SH (pay to script hash) addresses (these start with 3).
There are two possible formats of public keys in Bitcoin, so there are two valid addresses for any given private key.
Collisions are possible, but so astronomically unlikely that they are not a concern.
It's entirely feasible to generate enough private keys such that two of them would have the same address. You'd need about 2^80 on average. The problem is, while you could compute that many addresses, about 40 yottabytes of storage would be required, which is at least hundreds (probably thousands) of times more than currently exists. But this is just a parlor trick, it doesn't actually allow you to do anything bad to anyone's bitcoin.
If in the future, population levels out at around 10 billion people, and everyone used bitcoin having an average 100 addresses with a balance, that would be about 1 trillion or approximately 2^40 addresses. If you wanted to do an attack, you'd need to try on average 2^159 / 2^40 = 2^119 private keys to find one able to spend someone balance. If each person had a device able to try a trillion keys per second, we would expect it to take over 2 million years before anyone had success.
A nice thing about Bitcoin is that the protocol can support 256 bit addresses with only minor changes to clients if this ever becomes a realistic concern.

I have no particular desire to take up on your bet. You "winning" proves nothing. The average person cannot reliably generate a secure passwords or passphrases. The average person *can*, with some effort, memorize a randomly generated secure passphrase.
If you want to "prove" your point, you need to put together some sort of study with a significant number of people. Have them come up with passphrases using your scheme, hash the passphrases with unsalted MD5 (weak on purpose to make the cracking costs reasonable), and give out all the hints and hashes. You can then extrapolate the MD5 cracking times to what they would have been with a more reasonable hash. If you want to help people make better passphrases, let's do some actual fraking ***science***.
Finally - there's no reason to use brainwallets. They don't need rehabilitation. They need replacing. WarpWallet is strictly better. I finally implemented the WarpWallet derivation algorithm in C and benchmarked it today. It's on the order of *ten thousand times more secure* - even more if you use a salt as recommended. If you choose to use WarpWallet - *I would recommend you use BIP38 paper wallets instead* - randomly generate a passphrase with something like [diceware](

Finding a large brainwallet made for a great story, but it was not a pleasant experience.


I covered it in my talk - I had to cut the more detailed slides on it for time - but I followed the BTC to DeepBit, then convinced Tycho to send a message to them via email.


The best way to verify the legit owner is for them to sign a message with the address that funded the brainwallet, but that isn't always possible. This has been the case for a while. People have been actively stealing brainwallets for at least two years.
It wasn't an easy choice for me to release my code. My hope is that the attention brought by it will do more good (steering people to more secure choices) that it will do harm (helping bad guys steal). Most disclosures have similar issues. In this case, the bad guys seem to already be pretty good at stealing.
@_date: 2015-08-24 20:45:02
One idea I've been pondering is adding an actually random, but short, salt in addition to the email address - maybe four or five digits - and tell them to write it down. If they lose it, but still know their passphrase and email address, they can get it back by brute force with a few hours worth of CPU time.  I just don't want to put something half-baked out there.
As to other personal information, I think you underestimate how easy that is to obtain with automation. I also think it would probably be better to force a particular format for phone number and DOB - I can see someone tearing their hair out in frustration not being able to remember exactly how they typed that.
If I were a bad guy, I probably would not simply sweep through a whole list of Bitcoin user's email addresses to target warpwallet or something like your scheme. The cost of cracking is high enough that I'd actually try to guess who's likely to have a worthwhile amount of BTC and actually use one of these schemes. I'd then build a targeted list of words and phrases for them to run through brainflayer. With slow, salted hashes, you would need to crack smarter and more targeted.

You've got the idea. A botnet could try the top trillion (10^12 or ~2^40) possibilities in a few seconds. You really need to make sure you're not in the top *sextillion* (10^21 or ~2^70) possibilities. The only reliable way to do that is to randomly generate your passphrase.
Also, if you're turning a password or passphrase into a cryptographic key, there is *no excuse* for not running it through a KDF like scrypt or even pbkdf2. It literally makes it up to a million times harder to crack and the only expense is that you have to wait a fraction of a second while the CPU processes it.
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:03:28


I am not assuming that. What I'm saying is that cracking long, random passwords is not feasible, so cracking time is spent trying things that are more likely to get a match.


I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. You need to store a truncated address - 64 bits is probably sufficient - and either the private key, or the compressed passphrase/password, whichever is shorter. If you're doing real time theft, you don't need to look at the blockchain at all, only incoming transactions. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 15:41:14
I scan every address ever used, regardless of whether it has a balance. As of the last time I dumped the blockchain, this was about 80 million addresses. Increasing the number of addresses scanned does not significantly slow things down.  
@_date: 2015-08-14 16:56:11
That image is note entirely accurate. Finding a private key that works for a particular address is about 2^160 work, and cracking a public key (e.g. an address has been reused) is 2^128. Still pretty much impossible, but that infographic *vastly* overstates the difficulty.
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:24:03
FWIW, I'll be adding support for your scheme to [brainflayer](
It looks like you're using the same scrypt parameters as warpwallet, but without mixing in pbkdf2 results. Mandatory salt is good (I filed an issue with warpwallet recommending they make it "highly encouraged"), but I don't think the extra personal information you're requesting actually increases security significantly - if you have someone's name, email address or phone number, it's frequently trivial to find the rest of them and the birthday. That information doesn't tend to be protected.
Overall, your tool is *less secure than WarpWallet*. It currently allows a **BLANK** passphrase, and all the *salt fields can be left blank as well*. 
If you wanted to make this an actual improvement over warpwallet, bake a secure random passphrase generator into it, and strongly discourage people from choosing a passphrase themselves. If they want to choose a passphrase themselves, you should be using a KDF that takes more like five minutes to run in javascript. I don't think the file based keying is a good idea either. Too easy for people to do foolish things.
Easy to use security tools that *allow* insecure use *will* be used insecurely, and *will* hurt people.

Well, there are two problems with brainwallets.
1) Letting people choose passwords and passphrases leads to fail
2) Using scrypt or similar hardening algorithms makes user-chosen passwords and passphrases *way* stronger for very little cost, and this is not done in "traditional" brainwallets.
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:45:29

[replying to a now deleted comment]


The GRC page doesn't appear to advocate choosing a password randomly. It is misleading to the layperson, giving a message that boils down to "long == strong".


If the private key is derived from a short password or passphrase, you can store that instead and recreate the private key as needed.


Incoming transactions appear on the network and in the memory pool before they appear in the blockchain. Weak brainwallets get stolen with zero confirmations - before they make it to the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:10:43


The former category of users generally think they are the latter.

Terminology issue. I'm using the term "brainwallet" to specifically mean the privateKey = sha256(passphrase) scheme. WarpWallet is similar, but uses scrypt for key derivation. Scrypt (with the work factor WarpWallet has) makes computing the address for a given passphrase on the order of a million times slower.
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:11:24
The terminology is somewhat fuzzy, which is unfortunate. The paper specifically says it's talking about the sha256(passphrase) method with human-chosen passphrases.
I think *most commonly*, the term "brain wallet" or "brainwallet" is referring to that particular method.
The other uses of the term that I am aware of:
* Hardened^(1), non-hierarchical deterministic address generators that use a human chosen passphrase, such as [WarpWallet]( and [brainwallet.io](
* Hierarchical deterministic wallets that generate a series of seed words, such as [Electrum]( and [BIP39]( There may be some variant of this that is not hardened, but I am not aware of any examples.
* Other non-hardened, non-hierarchical deterministic address generators that use a human chosen passphrase, such as the ones implemented for Ethereum that use kerrcak256(passphrase) as the private key. The methods in the paper work on these as well with very similar performance.
My opinion is that the terms "brain wallet" and "brainwallet" are tainted by the weak implementations and different names should be used for better tools. WarpWallet, for example, describes itself as "a deterministic bitcoin address generator".
1. Hardened with a [KDF]( that is at least time-hard.

* My transactions are generally confirmed in minutes to a few hours. I frequently use merchants that use bitpay or coinbase which will usually accept my payment in a few seconds. 
* There are more reasons to have bitcoins. Many people mined when it was easy to do so. Some people have bitcoin just because they think the technology is interesting.

There are better schemes than the "standard" brainwallet. In particular, WarpWallet is literally around a million times more secure, *especially if you use a salt*.

12 *actually random* (the standard random function in most programming languages is not random enough) words from a wordlist containing at least 1000 words aren't going to get cracked even with the standard brainwallet scheme, but there's little downside to using something with a hardened kdf and it makes cracking *way* harder. Or you could use a BIP38 paper wallet and nobody can even attempt to brute force it without the encrypted private key.
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:47:35
NXT appears to use a significantly different algorithm for its brainwallets, so brainflayer wouldn't work on it without major modifications. If I'm reading the [NXT whitepaper]( right, it doesn't look like it's using a salt or any sort of hardened key derivation function on the passphrase and they're using curve25519 rather than secp256k1 (the elliptic curve used by bitcoin). Since curve25519 is faster than secp256k1, a hypothetical NXT brainwallet cracker would probably be proportionally (or nearly so) faster.

Your search space calculation is wrong, nobody cracks long passphrases like that. It would be attacked by combining multiple components together, in this case a common phrase, a year, a common first name, a last initial and some delimiting symbols.

are indistinguishable from pseudorandomly-generated public keys without knowledge
of the password. Put another way, we do not know how many brain wallets
are in use for which we were not able to guess the password. Nonetheless, given
that we tried over 300 billion passwords from over twenty customized word lists,
we are confident that the use of brain wallets remains quite rare.
We are making the assumption that the ratio of brainwallet users able to create strong passphrases vs not is not vastly better than seen in other circumstances. Given that we have seen large value wallets with relatively weak passphrases, this assumption does not seem unreasonable, but further research is warranted to resolve this.

Almost certainly never. Moore's law's had a good run, but we are approaching physical limitations of silicon and won't be able to keep it up much longer.

The specific way you have worded your second question is problematic. You're asking about "someone who used it in the proper way" - the problem is that people cannot self-evaluate whether they are using it properly. The security depends on whether the user selects an appropriate salt/passphrase combination, and history has shown that many people - even those who believe they have - fail to do so.
If you're able to use this thing "properly" you don't need to buy it. You can just run use scrypt to generate a seed on an air-gapped computer (old laptops can be had on eBay for $50 if you don't have one handy) to use with a tried-and-true offline HD wallet.

As I said in my other comment, this is BitGo's fault. I will say that I think it would probably be good if Bitcoin refused to relay transactions with fees that are more than 1000x higher than the default, but it wouldn't be 100% reliable. I could actually probably write a patch to implement that pretty easily, now that I think about it.

I wish more companies would promise not to be dicks with their patents.
Please don't give the "inventors" on these patents shit. Them being listed says *nothing* about how they feel about patents. The patent is legally required to list the people who came up with whatever it's about, but they have *zero* leverage in the process. It's always possible for a company to simply file non-cooperating inventor paperwork.

Most ISPs block port 25 outbound. If you're sending to a third party email server you have an account on, you can almost always use port 587 instead.

The transactions can't be made significantly smaller, so to do that you need to make the block size bigger, and making the block size bigger requires more bandwidth.
@_date: 2015-11-28 19:15:02
I think you're overplaying how serial things are. Blocks are inherently serial, as are the transactions contained within, however, most transactions are independent of most other transactions and thus can be verified (in terms of script checks) independently (in parallel).
Transactions can even be verified (again, in terms of script checks) preemptively, as they come in, before being included in a block. It's even perfectly valid to spend a transaction before it's been included in a block. Verifying a block does still require checking the serialized transactions' hashes vs already verified script checks (which can also be done in parallel) and the overall block hash (which must be done in serial).
The main problem with latency (which exists independent of block size and bandwidth) is 'orphan blocks' when two miners find blocks at very close to the same time. There are data propagation issues as well that are affected by slow links, but I don't want to get into that because I'm not sure to what extent they have been mitigated. Gavin [wrote something up]( about this.

I'm surprised you trust yourself not to forget all these obscure personal details. Not sure why you'd be any more likely to remember them.

We know random words are secure, and if you're worried about forgetting them, test them regularly or at least go through them in your head.
You can make backups using something that does shamir's secret sharing^*, put the file somewhere safe (preferably multiple places) and distribute shares to people you trust. If something happens to you, you or your heirs can gather a quorum and recover the backup.

It's easier to brute force a P2SH address than a P2PKH. You have to create private keys and then compute the public key for P2PKH, whereas with P2SH you only have to increment a counter and hash.
The link you supplied is about sending to a script that returns false, which would work, whereas in theory a colliding script could be found for a P2SH address. The difference between sending to 'OP_RETURN' and 'OP_HASH160 hash160(OP_RETURN) OP_EQUAL' is important.

I've been using bitwage for a small portion of my paycheck for about two months. A few points:
* They're currently still "in beta" and not charging any "fees", but the exchange rate isn't very good (you can see it on their site without an account).
* They comply with KYC, so be prepared to provide "dox".
* They do not support BIP32, but you can upload a bunch of addresses to use for future deposits. This was chosen over BIP32 because apparently path construction in BIP32 wallets varies a lot and they wanted to be 'safe'.
* Support was pretty responsive - it seemed like they default people to being on some waitlist but will activate you if you email them.

Restating it a bit more clearly - checking one candidate key against say, 1,000 addresses vs 150,000,000 addresses by scanning the blockchain doesn't take a significantly different amount of time (assuming you already have a list of all addresses in the blockchain).

You probably couldn't even use most of the apps on it because they need to phone home. They wouldn't have source code to the device. They wouldn't have the toolchains needed to compile apps.

Well, I don't know the exact layout of the site, but it should be doable with a wireless bridge, some grid antennas (140MPH wind rating is no problem) and mounting polls. You'd probably want to do a 5.8GHz wireless link - it doesn't need to be mounted as high, and while you need higher gain antennas, they're smaller. Slightly harder to aim, though.
You'd need to figure out how high to mount the antennas using a [fresnel zone]( [calculator]( and calculate a [link budget]( using the radio transmit powers, receive sensitivity and [free space path loss]( Rain fade shouldn't be an issue at 5.8GHz.
If there are no hills, large trees or tall buildings in the way (in other words, if you have radio line of site), it should be doable for well under $1000 (probably $300 to $700).
I'm surprised the wireless ISP won't send someone out to do a site survey to figure out whether you'll be able to get service - if there's radio line of site, someone competent does it they should be able to tell with pretty high certainty whether or not it'll work. If there's trees or buildings in the way, it's somewhat harder.
I assume from your description that there's probably multiple potential places for the other end of the link (you'd make a deal with a business or homeowner to have internet service and a point-to-point link installed at their location) and if you've got 2.5 acres you probably have some leeway (at least 300ft) in where your end of the link goes.

Given that it is very difficult to prevent people from using weak passwords/passphrases (password strength checkers do not work well enough), it is very bad design not to:
* Use a salt, which prevents attackers from cracking everyone's keys at once
* Make the hash slow, which increases the work an attacker has to do by several orders of magnitude while still being "fast enough" for the legitimate use case
The fact that the system *could* be used securely is irrelevant. The issue is whether it at least *tries* to still have *some* security in the worst case usage. A few lines of code could make the attacker have to do millions of times more work.
Think of a chainsaw that automatically shuts itself off if the operator lets go of the handle vs one that keeps running until manually switched off. A well trained person could use either just fine, but the shutoff feature is cheap to add, doesn't impede proper use, and makes the the chainsaw a lot less dangerous in many circumstances.

Well, of course you can prevent weak passwords/passphrases if you don't allow the user to choose them. I meant if the user is allowed to generate it themselves.
As a side note, I think it's harmful to use the term "brainwallet" for schemes other than sha256(passphrase) because people may be confused by vastly differing levels of security between them. Mnemonic seeds are fine, but would still benefit from a string key derivation function.

Authy backs up your secrets to the Authy servers. More convenient, but less secure.

She's a democrat covering an urban area in California, gerrymandering isn't the problem. I'm not sure that there have been any instances of another democrat running for her seat, and she'd probably still get reelected over any republican even if the local news ran footage of her kicking puppies.

Authy can add shared secrets intended for TOTP (Google Authenticator), then back that up to the Authy servers. This is a feature they advertise.
Google Authenticator, on the other hand, requires a rooted phone to extract the secrets.

A *promise* of return and *admission of risk* are mutually exclusive.

Thank you, was forgetting about the passphrase, though I think it is optional and not enabled by default.

Authy can be transferred to a new phone able to receive texts or voice calls to your phone number.

That's an encrypted wallet backup from blockchain.info. You'll have to figure out the password or passphrase.

How many people do you think need this but cannot use steganography or send the data encrypted over the internet to somewhere for safe keeping that they can get access to later?
@_date: 2013-06-12 20:45:01
[citation needed]. You register to vote, and they keep lists at each place of who has already voted, but AFAIK, at least in the US the machines don't say who a particular vote was attributed to (I don't think they're even supposed to save the list of who voted), and generally photography is not allowed when you're voting.

The intended use case is as follows:
You have a bizarre accident in which your phone falls into a hydraulic press. You are fine, but your phone is crushed.
You buy a new phone, and install authy on it. Authy verifies your device by calling your phone number or sending you a text. Once this happens, the app talks to the server and it is provisioned for your existing account.
I think there is some amount of safeguard to protect against your phone number being stolen (I think a recovery delay?), but there is still some risk.
It is also my understanding that when a website authenticates you with Authy, they're using them as a trusted third party to verify you. There is a shared secret between authy and your device.
Google Authenticator, in contrast, works by having a shared secret between the website and your device.
This is why Google Authenticator is "more secure". It doesn't care what your phone number is or who has control of it.

1) Generate a new bitcoin address, and copy this down.
2) Backup your current wallet.dat to several places.
3) Totally shut down your bitcoin client.
4) Replace your current wallet.dat file with a copy of the old one.
5) Re-start bitcoind. It will probably have to re-index the block chain. Give it an hour or so.
6) Send all your bitcoin to the new address you generated in step 1.
7) Wait about half an hour.
8) Totally shut down your bitcoin client.
9) Restore your new wallet.dat
10) Re-start bitcoind. It will probably have to re-index the block chain. Give it an hour or so.
11) Check your balance, should be updated.

The problem with every crypto voting system I've seen is that it either enables vote buying/blackmail/coercion or doesn't allow you to verify your vote. You need to be able to verify your vote, but it needs to be impossible to prove to a third party how you voted.

Hmm. That didn't seem to be the case when I tested it a while back, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's changed, or we're talking about slightly different functionality.

I agree it looks like it's too far ruined to even recover enough of the key to brute force the rest, but I've seen some pretty impressive QR code wizardry around here before.

The [slide deck]( is a quick read.

It was 34 characters starting with a `1`? If so, that's an address, not a public key. It won't get you anything.
A "wallet import format" private key would start with a `5`, `K` or `L`, and be 51 characters long. A hex private key would be 64 characters long and have numbers and letters `a` through `f`. There are also some systems the generate twelve word seeds.
I'd look to see if you have a wallet.dat file anywhere on that computer.
What website did you buy them from?
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:44:38
It looks like you copy/pasted around sections of the QR codes. I had a go at trying to get it to decode, but failed. The shading on the bill kinda gives hints about how you might have moved things around, though....

Bitcoin is designed in such a way that a break of SHA256 may not have any immediate impact (someone correct me if I'm wrong, I'm only 98% sure).
Bitcoin uses two hash constructions which it calls Hash256 and Hash160.
Hash256 is SHA256(SHA256(data)).
Hash160 is RIPEMD160(SHA256(data)).
Essentially, this is an insurance policy hoping that extending a break of SHA256 to Hash256 will take enough time to allow for a transition.

If votes are public, that will hurt more than the current corruption. Work somewhere where management has strong political views? Vote wrong and you get fired at the first excuse, and good luck proving it. Support same sex marriage and have ultra conservative family? Disowned. You really think this will result in elections that are more fair?

A friend asked me to recover this for him since the QR code is pretty well destroyed and he wasn't able to get the private key (blacked out) to work. I already figured the private key out and he spent them to a new address, but I wanted to see how far QR code ninja skills go. My friend is supposed to be sending a small bounty to the address shortly.

How is it that you've managed to avoid Coca-Cola's lawyers for two months (your domain name was registered early September this year)? I'm not familiar with Canadian trademark law, but in the US this is clearly "confusingly similar". 
Also, you have no real contact information on your site - just a fake phone number and the name of a city.
Your paypal is just to a hotmail address.
I'm not going to accuse you of being a scammer, but this seems really shady.

The average power usage should be somewhere between 1W and 5W per GH/s. The current hash rate is about 3.5PH/s, so this is somewhere between 3.5 and 17.5 Megawatts. For comparison, Google said in 2011 that they use [260 Megawatts]( across all their data centers world-wide.
