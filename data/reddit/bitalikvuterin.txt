I read an article once which made the claim that the NSA created Bitcoin (using the hashing algorithm that **they** created) to curb the inevitable consequences of the death of the Petrodollar.  Sort of a "if I can't have everything, no one can" type strategy.  It evens the playing field instead of another country (such as china or Russia) quickly establishing dominance with a wider market (all this is dependent on the petrodollar dying, which it is).  I'll see if I can find the article.

E: can to can't.

No, but it makes sense to create something that **nobody** can control, if you take into context the only global currency in the world at the moment, the petrodollar.  Libya wanted wanted to allow oil purchases across Africa/the Middle East through a gold backed dinar which was arguably one of the main reasons Gaddafi was killed.  
The NSA couldn't invalidate the btc block chain, but they *would* (assuming they **did** create Bitcoin) have extensive knowledge of the block chain technology before anyone knows about it, and let's not forget "Satoshi"s personal Bitcoin stash...
