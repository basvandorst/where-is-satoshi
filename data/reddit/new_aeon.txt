There's a difference however between mandatory and voluntary. In NYS if the bill passes it will be mandatory. People will have no choice. Currently, people have a choice whether or not they want to use an exchange.

If the Bitlicense passes in NY state there will be huge databases of bitcoin users that will be prime targets for hackers and crackers. If the NY state law passes business will have to keep detailed records of their customers that pay with bitcoin. This is similar to what  hospitals and medical offices are starting to do now. This would make those databases prime targets for people wanting to steal the information for identity theft, and other nefarious practices. Not to mention taking away from the somewhat anonymity of bitcoin use.

I've been on the internet for a very long time. One day I received an informal email from a small start up called paypal and I thought the concept was ridiculous. My exact words were "Good luck with that buddy" as I hit delete. Now don't I feel foolish. I'm not about to make the same mistake with bitcoin !

Right on. Just wanted to say you made my day with this post. The more we start using it, the more merchants will start to accept it, the more new people will start to adopt it. However, it all begins with you and me.
