I'll tell you what's clear to me, Uber is rotten to its core.

r/bitcoin has being compromised

We all know Cool S has already won, it symbolises infinity as well and generations of young people identify with it.
@_date: 2019-03-27 02:55:21
Well... We'll just make a NEW localbitcoins, with anonymity, blackjack and crypto hookers!

It's a symmetrical infinity symbol with sharp edges, it existed before time itself it's like asking who invented the circle

Consider this, the bigger a company gets the more fragile it gets. Apple SMASHED the smart phone market. Will they be able to dominate the next big thing? What if the next big thing is modular phones using different parts from different manufacturers?

I think it needs to be the S that is more similar to the infinity symbol, that is the angle where in the middle should be a slanted 45 degrees rather than a 90 degree corner

Satoshi symbol CONFIRMED

You've convinced me, I'm all in BTC now! Thanks for enlightening me! Just ignore BCH and HODL BTC! See you on the moon!

I, and the entire global population, want a scalable, fast, non discriminatory currency.

Because I want to better understand Bitcoin? Is this not r/Bitcoin? What your saying is fundamentally flawed, that Bandwidth infastructure will not be upgraded. I disagree? I'd say Bandwidth will be continously upgraded as files sizes will become of higher quality youtube videos music ect ect thus the infastructure will be in demand to handle them... like honestly take an objective look at what you are saying, you are saying that internet infastructure is going to remain where it is for another 15 years? sheesh thats not a world I'd want to live in! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:50:05
But it will... Bandwidth demand will increase for everything as time goes on and infastructure will be built to accomodate. Historically this has being the case anyway.

I have moved on mate, the delusion in this sub is off the charts, I bought the real bitcoin at $900 1 day ago lmfao. Enjoy the bags I have a feeling their going to be big ones. And never forget, WE TRIED TO TELL YOU.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:50:56
Indeed, also considering my countries pathetic internet bandwidth no doubt is a problem. But isn't this kind of putting horse before the cart so to speak? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:30:58
Won't node capacity increase as per moores law?

I am impartial to the whole bitcoin politics bs, I am a "may the best coin win" kinda guy, and for me the writings on the wall, just sayin' friendo, just sayin. 
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:12:29
With bitcoin and crypto you will be able to stream money and do stuff like pay per second micro payments for ubers and YouTube videos when it scales of course
@_date: 2019-04-18 09:50:46
There is sound argument for a deflationary currency (like bitcoin and gold), and when people say oh but then people will hoard money, this is false people will always need to spend money at some point for essentials and the things they want to buy, if anything a deflation currency would discourage needless purchases and encourage less mindless consumption

bit jealous? 
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:32:17
by living without the system as much as possible of course!
@_date: 2018-03-12 00:04:39
then use and support a different crypto... by there nature they are transparent

@_date: 2018-04-24 22:30:47
uhm they are investing in a new technology presuming it will be able to scale, its money on the internet kinda a big deal?
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:44:44
Bitcoin Cash will gain traction the old fashion way. Faster transactions, lower fees and increased scalability. It's the whole reason this schism is occurring, no?
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:48:04
They lack the support bitcoin has, although support has been waning for various reasons and here we are
