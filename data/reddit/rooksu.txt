No.  If you are opening the door to challenging things, I'll challenge you.  However, in the meantime, I'm content with letting everyone believe whatever the fuck they want.

To be 100% secure you would want to hold the Bitcoin in a wallet only you control.  Then AES encrypt the key.

As a seller, because I need to be able to offer instant confirmation on my online download sales.

Speculatively buy BTC to pay possible future ransoms? Seriously?

...where? Why was this removed?
