I actually feel a bit sick after reading that.

And Dave Kleiman! How about Group Satoshi?

I love Amir's attitude and the fact that he really doesn't give a shit what the authorities think - how many here would go and fight against ISIS for example? I think he's spot on, let ETH be the corporate friendly coin and lets use BTC as a tool for the people. So can we make this tool work please Jihan?

Sure, I have a little ETH and REP... but the majority of my stash is in BTC. If it helps, I have rarely had my attention kept by anything - I admit to having had many fads, but not a day goes by without me finding something of interest in this space. Once you've got some skin-in-the-game you'll find out that there's NEVER a dull day in crypto!

Congrats on joining the movement, at least you're in it now! I think its a good strategy to buy weekly/monthly if you got a wage coming in, a few years from now buying in at $2400 will seem like a steal.

My fellow crypto brother, great to meet you... were like OG's of this scene... But I still feel like a noob.

Every epoch must feel revolutionary to those in it - my old man never shut up about the fucking 60's. But WE have a monetary system that is outside of the central banking system, which for me means we can actually have a proper revolution, rather than a Rothschild-backing-both-sides-kinda revolution. Happy to be alive and aware of Crypto.

My pleasure dude.

Indeed it does brother!!

In Jan 2015 the only thing I wanted to do was buy more, but I had no fiat... I am so grateful to crypto, I've struggled financially all my adult life. Now people are actually asking me for advice. I love BTC.

:) Never really lost it, but Satoshi-enhanced-my-mojo didn't really scan ;)

I thought Bitcoin WAS the basket ;)

Dude, that was my attitude - they always say only put in what you can afford to lose, as I didn't have any 'real' money so I thought fuck it, go all in. Start now, jesus by the time you're my age you will be very comfortably off. Just HODL, don't try and be clever. Believe me the temptations are great, especially when some shitcoin starts pumping. Good luck!
