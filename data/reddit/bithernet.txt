You should never use your hardware wallet to pay for a coffee/beer, and you should use mobile wallet like [bitpie.com]( or bither wallet for that.
Hardware wallet is used for paying large amount of bitcoins/blockchain assets.

We have two different type of hardware wallets, one for watch edition (BITHD), the other for card edition (RAZOR).
RAZOR is good for everyone, because it can be easily put in your wallet with your other credit cards.
BITHD is good for the people want to take with you anywhere anytime. Because it is the watch, so you can easily feel it it there and difficult to lose. Even when you are taking the flight to other city, you do not need to take it off even when you are doing the security check.
So that's for different use case, you should think about it.

Have you been robbed because you are wearing an "Apple watch"?
@_date: 2019-07-04 06:17:57
because it looks just like any other smart watches, nobody will find out that you are taking hardware wallet.

Thanks, we will try our best to improve Bither as possible as we can. :D
@_date: 2015-06-23 09:22:00
We may consider this :)
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:39:06
Dear stim4444,
Because HDM model is still a little difficult for normal users to understand, we disable the "create HDM" function in currently version of Bither. Old users can still use this function, and can still recover when they lost their phone.
We may try to provide new improved models in the future.
@_date: 2014-07-28 03:34:10


When handling large transactions we use two or more pages of QR codes. Thanks

We will improve it when importing BIP38 private keys.
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:04:37
We work in a different way. There is no randomly generated addresses on Bither. We let you control the address generating part and we have an auto backup function. If you worry about your phone break down some time, you can manually backup the private keys on another phone or somewhere else. Normally we think a single person won't need too many addresses, therefore this process won't be a burden for you. So you won't need to worry about losing money because you forgot to buck up the private keys.
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:41:08
Well, when we come into this field, Bither works in a different way if you are talking about the randomly generated addresses now and then. 
Bither lets you control the address generating part. No more machine controlled randomly generated addresses which we think is confusing most of the times. 
An address is a basic working unit in Bither. You don't have to think about how many addresses you have in you wallet. Bither will not confuse you.

Hi, you guys. We've started a new android bitcoin wallet project called Bither.
Bither supports two running modes: Bither Hot and Bither Cold.
In cold mode, you must keep your phone's networks off. You can generate several private keys offline and store large amount of bitcoins on it. There's no reason to worry about the safety of your money as long as you keep the networks off.
In hot mode, your phone is online. You can both monitor the bitcoin addresses you generated on Bither Cold and generate several new private keys. Private keys on hot mode is used for small amount trades. For example, you can put maybe less than 1 btc on it for daily use. 
The monitoring part of hot mode is what does the magic. You can use it to generate unsigned transactions and use QR Code to communicate with Bither Cold to make valid transactions and send them. In this way your private keys which contain large amount of bitcoins will always remain offline.
Once you choose the mode, you will not be able to change it. 
Normally you'll need two android phones. One for daily use and one for cold storage. 
An old and cheap phone will be good enough to do the cold storage work. Since you will not want it to connect to the Internet, you can't install many apps on it and it's definitely not for daily use. So you don't want to spend much money on it. 
On the other side, you can use any of your fashion choice phone as the hot one. You may install facebook, twitter and any reddit client on it with the network connections. Bither Hot will always play well with them.
BTW for ones who don't trust us (no offense, we understand), we will put our source code on github in two weeks with our next release. In the meantime, you can try Bither with only a small amount of money. We do have a nice design and a friendly UE :) 
If you want to try Bither Cold, just know that we absolutely can't find a way to steal anything from a forever offline device ( if we knew the way, we would already be too rich to even look at your wallets )
@_date: 2014-09-13 08:07:29
We have submitted a BIP draft on bitcointalk. You may want to check [this]( out.
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:58:26
Android version is also available. 
[Google Play](
[Android Version Source Code](
For those who only have one iOS device, android phones can be really cheap. 
And yes, I am one of the developers. :)
@_date: 2014-05-20 02:40:32
They communicate via QR codes. You can monitor addresses on the cold phone by the online phone, generate unsigned transactions on the online phone, and sign them by the cold phone. Detailed in [this post](
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:24:47
It's not deterministic and we'll add exporting private keys in the next release.
@_date: 2014-05-16 02:27:45
we will release the source code ASAP
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:56:03
If there's no randomly generated addresses now and then, there will be no need to backup periodically. Thank you for your suggestion anyway we all do our effort to make things easier. This is what keeps the community going.
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:48:03
For your concerns, versions won't become incompitable. Before we develop new features, we'll find ways to be compitable with old versions. All released softwares on the internet have to do this thing, and we do too. 
And yes, we support Android 2.3 and up. And if we find this Android version too old to develop some new feature in the future, we'll make the new feature accessible only in new Android versions and keep the whole software computable way to Android 2.3. 
BTW Bither already has full functions of send/receive, hot/cold now. In the future we will only improve and develop some bonus features.
@_date: 2014-05-15 05:45:22
Thanks for supporting. We are busy developing now. You'll know when we finish the next release. And the code won't be too messy ;)
@_date: 2014-05-20 04:55:23
Thanks for support. We'll consider your suggestions. Bither is an open source project. Others can contribute to it on Github if they are willing to. More language is always a good way to support an open source project :) 
@_date: 2015-05-07 07:50:57
You can move your private key to the trash can. But we don't recommend deleting private keys, since this action may cause losing bitcoin. Thus sweeping mechanism is not currently supported.
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:36:00
Thank you for your remind of this project. We'll take a look at it.
What we built is a complete bitcoin protocol implementation and we have built a fully functional light wallet client upon it.
We are sorry for the confusion caused by the words we chose.
Thank you for your feedback. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:44:25
1. Each HDM seed is generated separately on its own device. Server key and the Hot key are NOT derived from the Cold key. The Cold key is used for HDM Server's BitID access control. In this way, if you lose your hot phone, you can use your cold phone and server to recover bitcoins, and if Bither server is down, you can use your hot and cold phone to recover bitcoins. Generally, you only need to backup the cold seed.
2. Currently we do not support importing seeds, because importing will make the HDM account generating process too complicated, we haven't found an elegant way to do this. We only support recover cold seed from backup at this point.
@_date: 2015-01-21 04:18:34
And the private key (Cold[0]) will not leave the cold phone. The hot and cold phones will communicate via QR Codes to finish the authentication process.
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:09:44
Thanks. I've corrected it.
@_date: 2015-01-21 04:16:26
The authentication only needs to be done once. The authentication info will be encrypted using the user's password and stored in the hot device. If the  user loses his hot phone, the password can buy him some time, but he should still send his bitcoins to another address with the cold and the server keys ASAP.
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:49:38
HDM = HD + Multisig
* 2/3 Multisig;
* 3 keys (Cold, Hot, Server) all based on HD;
* XRandom seeds for HD;
* Access server API via BitID technology;
* HD's convenience + Multisig's safety;
* Easy to backup (only need HDM Cold seed);
* Bither's Cold/Hot modes with XRandom are the best mates with HDM;
* TXs are signed based on RFC6979 to ensure security;
* Parent pub keys of each HD chain won’t leave its own device (Cold, Hot, Server). No ways to leak;
* BIP16, BIP32, BIP39, BIP44, BitID, RFC6979, XRandom, Bither (Cold/Hot)
@_date: 2015-01-20 05:03:34
We use the first address of the external chain of the first account of HDM Cold's BIP32 path for BitID authentication.
@_date: 2015-01-20 05:01:37
Thanks for your advice. We may consider to publish a standardize HDM configuration in the future.
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:05:05
You are right. Open-source is very important for Wallet, especially for hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-03-15 11:35:21

BITHD Frozen Armor ( [bithd.com]( ) is designed by our team (Bither Team).
It is the best way for you to store your 12-24 words HD seeds with amazing price.
@_date: 2019-03-23 07:44:20
Yes , you are totally right about this.
But since there are so many people still using exchanges to store their cryptocurrency, help these exchanges to have better COLD-MULTISIG wallet solution is a good thing we should do.
@_date: 2019-03-29 06:03:49
for companies and groups, multisig is very good for multiple people controlling assets together.
@_date: 2019-03-16 14:07:15
But develop a product and print logo on this product, I don't think it is not good.
@_date: 2019-03-15 08:51:47
Working on it, and we will list it on amazon soon.

LBTC is LBTC, and it is a forked coin. Bitpie originally supported many forked coins and had helped many users to claim forked coins. But months ago, we had stoped supporting LBTC because we do not have time to develop for their future update.
So, stop confusing other peoples with forked coin LBTC and technology Lightning Bitcoin.
Upgrade to 3.9.7 (Android version), and you can find out the Lightning Network Beta functions.
I am so sorry to find out that you are trying to misleading other peoples and saying bad words.
@_date: 2019-03-15 12:26:00
You can take a look at this. Although the voice is in Chinese, you can still find out what will the "Frozen Armor" look like.
@_date: 2019-03-23 07:48:47
Interesting, currently we are working on providing better Multisig hardware wallet ([bithd.com]( solution for users, and this is awesome.
@_date: 2019-03-15 10:29:44
You buy a metal **Seeds Memorizer** and you choose your own characters. who can steal your coins?
@_date: 2019-03-23 06:19:59
Many bitcoin/blockchain companies and groups, including exchanges, offchain wallet services, token funds, and so on, store their large amount of blockchain assets on single "NON-MULTISIG" addresses. We do not know whether these addresses are cold or not, but definitely NON-MULTISIG, private keys are controlled by one singular person, that is really a high risk thing.
So we decide to initiate the "Multisig Day" Proposal for the bitcoin/blockchain world, and as a wallet developing team, we will prepare tens of thousands dollars of devices (hardware wallets and metal seed cards) to help companies and groups to begin using Cold+Multisig wallet solution for their bitcoin/blockchain assets.

The price is $29.99 , and it has better quality.
@_date: 2019-03-16 15:25:36
Thanks for your supports.
Because it is the first version of our Lightning Network supports, there are many things to do to improve our users experience. We will continue tuning this.
Thank you.

Thanks for your clarification.
Also you can try our bitpie wallet with small amount of blockchain assets, it supports multiple chains with many other functions.
Currently our team has 3 product series:  
1. Bither Wallet ( bither.net ) for decentralized bitcoin wallet with Hot/Cold mode.  
2. Bitpie Wallet ( bitpie.com ) for multiple chain and in wallet instant exchange service.  
3. Bithd Hardware Wallet ( bithd.com ) with Card design and Watch design and easy to use BTC/ETH/EOS/USDT multisig functions.
Bither Wallet is full open source.
BITHD Hardware Wallet is full open source for hardware design and firmware source code. (the firmware is based on trezor and we have developed many new functions).
Until today Bitpie Wallet is close source, we may consider the open-source policy on Bitpie in the future.
