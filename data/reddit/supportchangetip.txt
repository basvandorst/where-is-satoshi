never said free.  realistically if you have 10000 BTC, and you threw 1BTC to the wind you have just "increased adoption".  
since "increased adoption" brings more attention and more value to BTC, wouldn't 1 non-free BTC bring you more value to the 9999 BTC you have remaining?  all while, adoption has not really increased since transactions. 
all i am saying in this post is that transactions are not a valid metric for gauging adoption because it can be faked (both then and now).

you mean when i willfully violate the law?  i have a warrant placed against me.  i don't know how to continue at this point, but lets assume i didn't know the warrant was open.  i would find out when i did a background check whether it was done by myself or by a potential employer, and i would consult with a lawyer on the best mode of action.  this would likely be to turn myself into the court and face the charges and potentially spend time in jail.
what would happen to you if you didn't pay tax (or otherwise violated laws)?

Just out of curiosity.  If I have 10000BTC to play with, I could write a script that would mix and tumble my own coins(for a minimal cost for one who has 10k BTCto play with) would that show increased transactions?  How does that translate to increased adoption.  If I tumble at 2x or 3x the original speed (maybe spread my script across multiple availability zones), this increases transactions but does not prove increased adoption.
Food for thought(tm)

i just explained how exactly it could be faked.  you choose to believe what you want to believe.  my example that 1/1000th of just one person's total bitcoin wealth (replace 10000BTC with 50000BTC..80000BTC and that portion of wealth diminishes even further) is enough to skew a believers mind.






hook. line. sinker.  good day :)

full disclaimer: i sold 1/10th of my BTC for over $700,000, 2 years ago.  i also started a bitcoin service with about 5000 BTC.  that service will never make any money but it helps with "adoption".  for fun i set aside 10000 BTC to do exactly what i said above.  as vps instances become cheaper, i spawn more nodes.  my balance for this project has not dropped below 9999 BTC yet.    i hope the price rises above $500/BTC someday because I will have more than enough money to retire and walk away from this.. but as long as transactions go up people think BTC is hitting mainstream.
i love my fishtank by the way, it was the first thing i purchased with my newfound wealth.  good day :)
