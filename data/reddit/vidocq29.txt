Not sure if it's an option for you, but I had a $250 bank account limit on Coinbase...as soon as I added a debit and credit card, my limit jumped instantly to $5,000.

Are these same day options going to be less than 3%?

Circle DID make you buy at about a 1% higher rate than coin desk market value, so that was their "fee." If you put money in coinbase's "USD wallet," once it is available you can exchange it immediately to BTC. It's still not as good as Circle. But as far as ease of use goes, it's the closest thing to Circle we currently have in the USA. Apparently blockchain wallet is letting 34 European countries buy directly from your wallet (like Circle did). Alas, not available for us Americans :(

They aren't allowing BTC transfers anymore. As far as I see it, you're gonna have to put the funds back into your bank account and then find coinbase with that

It says 34 European countries. But so far the USA has been left out

Rosie, if you work for the company, then you should be able to provide a link that works. That is, unless your work ethic is reflective of Coinbase's business ethics

I think you're gonna have to refund it to your debit card or bank account and then upload it into one of your Coinbase wallets.
As far as I see, Circle no longer allows BTC transfers
