Is.  But....prison.  I like to think at some point I will visit him.  But as I get older, I realize that your friends from 18-25 really fizzle out  by your early 30's....cuz life, families, prison....

I agree. If he leaked it all himself as I believe, he will lay low until media blitz backs off and then quietly without rocking the boat come back in with his white paper 2.0 and Bitcoin will go from there.  No prob

This is hilarious.  The part in the gizmodo article where his wife, "smiles coyly", what a motherfucking setup.  KUDOS to you muthafuckin NOT nick szabo muthafucka.  Shit.  Upvoted my ass.  I'm loving this cryptocurrency fanfare, i'm a fanboy. i'm a motherfucking fanboy.

I have a crack in my screen, it looked like it said, 'has some parents too!'  Strange enthusiasm...about him having parents....better click to see me thought!

This.  Get ready because CW is SN.  And it's going to get more and more interesting....

Yep. Came here to say this.  That's the reason he is at the panel. He knows nick szabo from the 90's crypto mailing lists.  It was a group effort. They all know who is involved.  Also Ross was a personal friend of mine. So came here to say that.

You guys should probably take a deep breath and realize that many people high up in the Bitcoin community most likely already knew....
That's why he was on the panel.  Judging from Gavin's response, I'll betcha he already knew!

Hmm. CSW sockpuppet account tries to inject idea that CSW makes a partial payment or settlement to the ATO after raid and then he goes to UK???  Maybe he did make a payment because why on earth would he go to UK if the ATO was trying to put him away?

You are good!  This is very interesting.  Can't wait to see what our reddit detective team will find next.  :)

Gavin just asked wright to do exactly this in the wired article a few a hours ago.  He says this is leaving him in a bad position.  He 'assumed' wright would follow up and now 'assumes' it may because he doesn't want to make it official official yet, because emotions.

just so you're clear, most likely he was only paid out $8 million.  And it was for 2 previous tax rebate scams. 2 mil and 6 mil respectively

Unless he will! And I will be vindicated for my prediction during the first wright reveal.  He releases white paper 2.0 and returns in a BLAZE of glory.  Been eating a lot of popcorn today :)

Thanks for this. Now I am finally taking my tinfoil hat off I have worn since december.  CSW is a talented conman.  I can't wait for this fucking movie

I'm crypto-retarded, but is it likely whoever made these edits was ACTUALLY at this resort in Antigua?

Whatever is going on, I like it.  When I think about people who have been part of the cyberphunks mailing list for 20 years, it dawns on me that this whole CSW thing could be a long term master plan by the Satoshi team.  These guys have been patient and methodical for a long long time.  Everyone thinks CSW is a sociopath because he is TROLLING them so hard.

 whoa whoa. buddy.  spending 4 hours a day reading about CSW is def productive.  All knowledge expansion is productive!  This is like a motherfucking library. IN HERE
