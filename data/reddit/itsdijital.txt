Outsider here, I wouldn't buy any btc even at $0.50. To me it's old outdated tech and has little value compared to modern coins.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:07:18
Well obviously if someone offered me btc today at $0.50 I'd be all over it. But if the price crashed to .50, well then it pretty much would be dead anyway.

Lots of computing power? Yeah, but it would be a lot harder than...
Lots of money, easy to accomplish with a relativity small amount of money for eliminating a serious threat (if it ever comes to that point). No one will really talk about it here, but the fact of the matter is that governments could buy up the majority share of BTC and either destroy the market or control it just like they do with fiat.
Everyone points to gold as being the role model, but who are the overwhelmingly majority owners of gold? Governments.

Carbon has a ton of different forms. A piece of charcoal isn't going to conduct anything. Nor is a Diamond. A stick of graphite will do better, but nothing like any of the metals. Graphene and nano tubes are amazing, but only under certain conditions and are very challenging to produce.
As it stands, silver is king.

I mean, all those things kinda are true. I don't think it's a hoax, but the market (at 1 billion or even if it went to 2 billion) is still really tiny. The actual value is hard to place because there is no underlying physical good and it is the first of it's kind. And Satoshi? Well no one knows who he/she/them are.

It's kind of a catch-22. Business want stability before they get in, but the market isn't going to stabilize until businesses get in.
If a bunch of businesses accepted BC, most of them wouldn't change the price too often. People will then compare the BTC price to those steady BTC prices when deciding what price to exchange at.

Here is one way (and the most likely way) the government(s) could easily ruin it:
Step 1. Buy out huge swathes of the market. Hell they could even buy the entire market right now pretty easily. The anonymity of Bitcoin actually makes this really easy to do undetected. You just need a lot of money, like the amount a government would have.
Step 2. Announce legal investigations (no need to actually write any laws) into BT and simultaneously place massive sell orders. Essentially crash the market into the ground. Make it look like people are scared. Again, easy because of anonymity.
Step 3. Repeat. But this time around maybe drive the price down slower. Maybe add in some random erratic fluctuations. Lots of fear. You pretty much have full control over the price.
The media will go to crazy town ripping the currency apart. The internet will be flooded with stories of people losing all manner of money. No one will know whats really going on and most importantly a lot of peoples faith will be shattered. 
They can't kill the currency, but they could inflict some serious wounds. Everyone here is talking about how they couldn't kill the currency. They wouldn't, they have access to massive amounts of money making it easy to commandeer the market. The US has already spent billions, if not hundreds of billions, destabilizing the economies of countries they don't like. They got it down to science.
**TL;DR** Imagine the 2 little girls down the street are selling Kool-aid and for some reason it threatens your total net worth. You can't kill the girls - that's too messed up to be possible. So you just go down the street, buy all their Kool-aid (for a trivial amount compared to what you stand to loose), and pour it down the drain.
**EDIT**: Now that I think about it, they could just announce this plan and the market would crash on it's own. Bernanke could come out tomorrow and say "Yea, we *might* buy out the market and run it into the ground". The price would tank.

Everyone always champions BTC's freedom from government control and regulation. I would just like to point out how naive of a view that is.
Here is one way (and the most likely way) the government(s) could easily ruin/control bitcoin:
Step 1. Buy out huge swathes of the market. Hell they could even buy the entire market right now pretty easily. The anonymity of Bitcoin actually makes this really easy to do undetected. You just need a lot of money, like the amount a government would have.
(Optional step) Stop here and become the sole regulator of the whole market, push prices as you please. You have the entire currency by the balls.
Step 2. Announce legal investigations (no need to actually write any laws) into BTC and simultaneously place massive sell orders. Essentially crash the market into the ground. Make it look like people are scared. Again, easy because of anonymity.
Step 3. Repeat. But this time around maybe drive the price down slower. Maybe add in some random erratic fluctuations. Lots of fear. You pretty much have full control over the price.

But often at a glacial pace. It's one of the big reasons why we have moved to an increasingly regulated market. Would Standard Oil and Bell System have eventually lost their monopolistic footholds on the market? Sure. But it might well of taken decades upon decades (see: East India Company). In a free market the tools for destroying competition are way more powerful than the tools for creating competition.
Regulations were/are introduced to try and balance the power that the free market naturally grants to the strongest entities, and thereby create a more competitive, faster moving market.

The whole Cyprus thing [is a joke]( People are just clinging to it to keep the BTC hype going. The price started going up weeks before the whole Cyprus thing anyway. Not to mention that upon searching actual Cypriot news  agencies (not msm echo chambers) for information about this Cyprus BTC rush, I found [*nothing*]( except one article in their largest newpaper about the lone BTC atm. Doubly not to mention that people need what money they were allowed to withdraw for things like food and rent.
This subreddit is the absolute worst place to come for advice on buying BTC. It's like calling a company to ask them if they are a good investment, *of course they are. Of course BTC is*. So few people here actually care about the good of the currency, they just want to ensure that they make a lot of their everyday currency.

Hype and speculation.
Reminds me of the tech bubble back during the turn of the century. The internet was exploding (way more than BC is) and people where jumping all over tech stocks. The sky was limit. Any company that ended in .com was raking in investments left and right. It was the internet, it was high-tech and the future. Then one day the tides turned and everything came crashing down. Lots of people lost *a lot* of money.
I have a lot of interest in BC as a currency, but right now people talk about it like it's an investment tool and treat it like a penny stock. Once the price stabilizes I'll pick some up (and so will businesses, not just a few here and there), but right now it's plain *scary*.

@_date: 2013-03-30 08:22:45
The fact alone that TH essentially can't pay for anything their business needs with BT is enough of a barrier. 
If they were to decide to take BT right now it would be purely a publicity stunt and all the BC received would most likely be written off as a marketing expense.

You gotta ensure that you can consistently solve blocks. Especially if the difficulty spikes once ASICs hit.

Fiat exchanges experience significant lag during crashes too. Even in 1929 the exchange was "ddos'ed" by sell orders.

To be fair, the bitcoin market is extremely shakey too. The market is so thin that handful of BTC holders could click a button and crash the market right now if they wanted. Hell this whole price surge could of been done by one wealthy individual on some sort of power trip. I mean nothing special happened 5 weeks ago to trigger this.

In computing there is a tradeoff between flexibility and power. CPU's are very flexible but relatively weak. ASIC's are extremely rigid but very powerful.
A CPU is like pen, slow but you can draw whatever you want. An ASIC is like a stamp, fast but only draws one thing.

The fact that the value against the dollar has gone up by 800% in 9 months is it's biggest caveat as a currency. 
Of course everyone here is super happy about it - they are making lots of the currency they actually use off it. For people who want to see widespread acceptance of BC, it's extreme volatility is real upsetting.
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:22:35
People right now want to buy and sell, not create and use. A little unfortunate if you ask me.

It's in the best interest of people who own BTC to trumpet the hell out of it and demonize anyone who says otherwise. They could think deep down that the currency is junk, but they will still tell anyone and everyone that it is the best thing ever with no worries in sight. Their biggest priority is maintaining positive hype.
Go check out penny stock forums. The rhetoric on them is almost identical to this subreddit. People circle-jerking about how greatly under-valued the company is, regardless of it's actual value, and how everyone should buy buy buy because the stock is going to (or is) skyrocketing. They aren't doing it to celebrate, they are doing it to get people to keep buying.

Exactly, a single wealthy entity could buy up a huge majority of Bitcoins and become the de facto regulator. Right now a handful of venture capitalists could get enough money together to create Bitcoin Inc.
