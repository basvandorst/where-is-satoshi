Let me guess, you think larger block supporters want to destroy Bitcoin? And Andreas, merely by noting the pressure on certain Core devs to justify their stance on HFs, is also out to destroy Bitcoin (presumably because he wants all the focus on Ethereum)? No need to answer.

Spam attacks were not the cause of year-over-year transaction volume growth.
@_date: 2016-08-31 16:44:57


Why would someone of the development need to confirm this?
If someone presents a signed message, you would assume that person stole Satoshi's keys... unless Bitcoin devs who worked closely with Satoshi affirm that, based on their correspondence with this person, they too are convinced he or she is Satoshi. Right?
I realise, of course, this is all moot because there is no signed message.

Hmm, I think it was simple recognition that one alt, Ethereum, was quickly establishing its own network effects. It hit $1B market cap comparatively quickly. Let's not forget, Coinbase wasn't the only Bitcoin only exchange/company to flick the switch on Eth. Several other did (several exchanges and Bitcoin  companies like Lamassu, BlockCypher, Blockstack, BitWage, CoinKite, etc).
The DAO debacle set Ethereum back years and, IMO, has given Bitcoin a lot more breathing room.

It's a baby step. If it leads to cost savings through automation and other efficiency gains (debatable but central bank buy-in could make it happen), it will further legitimise Bitcoin (as the next step towards anot independent, bona fide digital bearer asset).

So Gavin A is being controlled by threats to his family but, for example, Blockstream's Core devs are not? Does the CIA's reach not extend that far?
Re CW, it looks like Gavin A (and multiple others) were tricked by a very elaborate con (though note that the others still say CW is Satoshi). That said, we just don't know what he/they saw in that room.
Funny thing is, had CW immediately signed a message, the first reaction of the community  (Gavin included) would have been "prove it to the Bitcoin devs that know you best"!
(I am not for a moment suggesting CW is Satoshi, but it's at least as ridiculous as your Gavin is CIA claim.)
@_date: 2016-08-30 09:38:06
Good spot, but I don't think increasing the max block size is any more of a sacrifice in security than introducing SegWit.

An interesting angle, but I think she's wrong (at least as far as Bitcoin is concerned). I could see large holders in a PoS system having fiduciary duties (exchanges, for example). Similar principles might also apply to smart contract creators (the slock.it devs insisting no one would lose money due to the recursive call bug springs to mind).
Follow the twitter thread for much depressing lawyer chat about how best to regulate devs and code development(!), as if it were possible or desirable.

I think the assumption is that miners would not fork away from a majority of economic nodes in the first place. Fair point though -- the miners could misjudge and fork away from where all or a larger part of the value lies.

Obvious danger is there will always be some people that say ever rising fees rising and disappearing use cases are not an issue and that the system is working correctly. Making it controversial.

@_date: 2016-08-15 08:35:26
No, they didn't. Each of XT, Unlimited and Classic refused to fork the network without a majority of the hashrate. They remain Core compatible. Entirely different from forking away from the hashrate.

Signing a user supplied message would be impressive, I just don't know how that could be possible whilst spending is still physically prevented. I should probably have a play around with one of my Opendimes before assuming too much.

Crawlers like nodecounter and coin.dance count node preferences. If you run Core, you don't support 2M. If you run eg XT or Classic or Unlimited, then you do.

Agree. I do think Ethereum f'd up though (maybe were destined to anyway). There was a lot of momentum behind Ethereum/ether, it could easily have established its own strong network effects.

Account less than 2 months old called MasterOfMind suggests mind games being played by the other side. Yawn. The arguments are well understood. Bitcoin transaction volume growth has stalled and now we must sit and wait for SegWit and L2 solutions.

The next stage of cooperation and development will give you yet more! Trade your future work and live in your very own house right now -- amazing! Card networks are amazing too -- in the UK, at least, I can touch to pay using a single piece of plastic, saving minutes each day, and all my purchases are insured, i am protected from thieves, etc. I even get rewarded for spending! These are, in fact, incredible efficiencies made possible by "third parties" aka other trading parties.
The trick, of course, is minimising rent seeking/extraction. Go to far though and you have socialism or communism.
@_date: 2016-08-14 16:01:42
Sure, so only a relatively small number of people want to spend 8c on a transaction. That makes sense. Kind of destroys the artificially restricted supply/low volume/high fee network some are aiming for though. If 8c is too high, best to increase capacity now so we can transition from block reward to fee-only before everyone loses interest.
@_date: 2016-08-24 23:02:59
So there was a successful double spend against Customer A, timed perfectly with a one block re-org, for 0.0001 bitcoins? (Is your suggestion that ChineseDudeInSzechuanCave was also involved -- knowing full well his perfectly valid mined block would be lost in a subsequent re-org, along with the block reward and fees?) 
I'd chalk this one down to "you take your chances" and "wait for more confirms if you want greater certainty".
So what did the court decide? (It doesn't matter.)

@_date: 2016-08-01 13:55:36
Because immediately after a fork in Bitcoin, the low hashrate chain will find it very difficult to find blocks (given that the level of difficulty for finding blocks would be the old one intended for total hashrate). I don't have the numbers to hand but it would make that version of Bitcoin virtually unusable (until the next difficulty adjustment, 2016 blocks after the previous adjustment).
I mentioned changing PoW because I don't think Bitcoin miners would tolerate a very-weak-but-competing fork for any length of time; they'd be more likely to mess with it (eg its difficulty) or kill it.
@_date: 2016-08-15 14:00:43


Because... ? Hint: BU requires significant hashrate to mine bigger blocks before BU nodes consider that PoW chain valid. You allude to the acceptance depth yourself. So we're back to square one. Happy to agree to disagree on this one.
@_date: 2016-08-22 10:10:46
Used to be the same for Eth.
@_date: 2016-08-14 10:40:05
I think you mean the majority of the Bitcoin community chose not to purposefully fork away from the hashrate which had already committed itself to running Core compatible software. That is, no one thus far has taken the nuclear option. So not quite the same thing.
@_date: 2016-08-06 07:03:54
The Ethereum community had a difference of opinion about how to proceed: immutable always, arguably sacrificing the planned move to PoS, or collectively act against theft/fraud in extreme circumstances and continue on the path to PoS.
With hindsight a split seems like the right result (and the design of Ethereum made that result more likely). The market seems to agree: ETH + ETC is (unbelievably!) worth more than old ETH.
Maybe one will eventually wither and die, but at this moment in time, both opinions on what ETH should be appear valid (according to the market).
The question for Bitcoin (or at least those consideringa fork away from Core consensus): should the fundamental difference of opinion in Bitcoin lead to two coins? Would the market support both?
@_date: 2016-08-24 11:07:48
It looks like an interesting pitch by the relevant banks to assist central banks to effectively issue their own IOU tokens. It makes some sense to me, as a use case, but there are still a bunch of unanswered questions.

Highlights the change in Bitcoin, no? Ver has been consistent in his views.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:55:09
AFAIK, Bitcoin has not been forked before (we're not talking about the repo here, we're talking about the blockchain and it's seven years of history). I have no idea how it will do, or how many coins or which version will persist after the fork. Just saying that an actual hard fork looks increasingly likely.
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:24:18
Ah, makes sense, thanks. I read it more as "let's start with this idea and see where we get to".
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:32:24
To be fair, Core itself has had substantial updates to eg mempool management to better cope with congestion and increasing fees and other wallet software has had to improve too (all good things).
Also, demand for TXs seems to have stalled, hence fees not exploding (yet). That's hardly something that could have been predicted (nor is it a good sign).
@_date: 2016-08-22 10:01:23
Speculation becomes a use case. So long as exchanges complete their KYC and maintain adequate AML systems, there should be no issue in dealing with XMR.
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:13:02
If you create a 2M block today, no one will care (except you, for the wasted money you threw at it). Unlimited and Classic nodes will continue to work just fine. Neither will "fork off".
All it proves is exactly what I said: forking away from the hashrate is a huge decision not to be taken lightly. The nuclear option that precisely none of those clients support.
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:34:15
Whilst I applaud the message, I have to imagine that most money on BitFinex was there for active trading and margin trading. Most BitFinex users were "corporates". For those purposes, you must necessarily deposit coins.
@_date: 2016-08-30 09:44:12
I hope you're right but it's not clear to me that beyond some limited optimisation (effectively compressing transactions - which of course is great) and providing sufficient scale to make L2 solutions work, the (most vocal) Core devs actually _want_ more capacity. Rather they seem to want perpetually full/nearly full blocks and high fees. The question really is how high (if we assume Bitcoin's network effects are sufficient long term to maintain very high fees)? Too high and the main net becomes the preserve of the 1%.
@_date: 2016-08-22 06:46:34
None of this matters much unless and until exchanges accept XMR for fiat. Until then, we're dealing with BTC. We saw a bunch of exchanges accept Eth when it gained significant attention -- that's what XMR needs for network effects to develop.
@_date: 2016-08-01 06:52:37
Not disagreeing necessarily but it would be much more difficult than with Ethereum. You would have to immediately abandon the "old rules" to change difficulty on the low hashrate chain (and, in all likelihood, change PoW too), just for your Bitcoin to work at all. It would require (potentially signicant) greater resistance/economic power.

It's okay to disagree with or question conclusions reached by particular Core contributers on any particular point, including the block size issue.

They're hyping a specific coin with a unique feature that (in theory) is very attractive to all DM participants.

@_date: 2016-08-05 22:23:26
Yes but I believe things were a bit different back then. Satoshi would update code and people would update their nodes, no questions asked. This particular change was unannounced at the time AFAIK.
Edit: ha, yes, fact checking!
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:34:08
Entirely possible. I can't see it staying ahead of the current chain, but that doesn't seem to be the aim necessarily. Rather I think they are greatly encouraged by ETH/ETC (ironic given the same event has been used by to warn against HFs); they believe the support of an exchange and a mining pool (or even a change to the PoW algo) will be enough to ensure their version of Bitcoin survives and grows regardless. Speculators will speculate, hodlers will hodl, etc.

Sure, okay, it won't be a fork, it will be an alt coin. There are no such things as forks, only spoons. Whatever helps you conceptualise and internalise.
@_date: 2016-08-06 06:45:38
Well, ~15% of all nodes do in fact support 2M blocks. So any hard fork would immediately have their support. Also, the intention is to get at least one exchange and some hashrate involved from the outset (which may or may not include a change in the PoW). Point being this has moved away from "let's get the miners to fork to 2M" to "we've seen ETC thrive, let's do the same with or without the miners).
You don't need to care. Bitcoin doesn't care, never did. You will likely have two coins though, which worked out well for Ethereum folk (ETH + ETC is inexplicably worth more than ETH was, confounding expectations).
@_date: 2016-08-31 10:35:18
No, I'm not "fucking retarded". (Although I suppose I wouldn't know if I was?)
You just misunderstood my point, or maybe I wasn't clear enough.
My point was simply this: in the pre-CW "who is Satoshi" chat, people would say things like "a signed message would not be enough", "he could have gained access to one of Satoshi's keys" and "he would have to provide extra proof, like convincing early devs that he was Satoshi".
So had CW's _first act_ been to provide a signed message to the public - exactly what you are calling for - that would not have been enough for many (including, I suspect, you and me). The community would almost certainly look for confirmation from Gavin A. Just saying.
@_date: 2016-08-01 11:25:48
Economic nodes - the ones that matter - will upgrade. And there might be more of them if Bitcoin is allowed to grow, which it currently can't.
Not sure how we permanently avoid HFs. Some capacity beyond compression and discounts will be needed eventually.

Undeniable that new money in crypto now goes to alts, not Bitcoin. Other alts grow, albeit slowly, Bitcoin does not. It literally can't. I think this would be even more pronounced had Ethereum not f'd up.
@_date: 2016-08-28 13:23:56
My understanding: there will be a release with SegWit code active (0.13.1?), at which point miners start their signalling. When a sufficient % of miners are signalling, SegWit activates.
@_date: 2016-08-01 11:18:15
The debate started years ago, between devs. To suggest the bigger block argument is new and only being pushed by certain Bitcoin companies that you now deem to be spammers is absurd. The result of years of discussions to date? A few fixes to fee guessing and mempool management. Bitcoin growth was stopped dead months ago.
@_date: 2016-08-18 11:08:08

@_date: 2016-08-08 07:34:23
No doubt, agree there. From an Eth holder's perspective however (which I am not btw), there is no good reason for BF as custodian of your Eth to apply some sort of ad hoc bail-in after a security breach which did not impact any Eth holdings. I'd be amazed if big holders all take the loss.
Maybe we'll see another Eth HF to undo the haircuts. :)
@_date: 2016-08-24 21:58:11

Some people will have been reckless, letting their money sit within BitFinex, but keep in mind BitFinex is an exchange and it does offer advanced products like margin trading -- the majority of coins were likely there for that purpose ie active trading.
@_date: 2016-08-30 16:09:48
Hmm, what makes you think block space would be free? Wouldn't the miners decide how much to charge? TX fees were a thing long _before_ full blocks.
Personally, I'd shoot for more low fee TXs as opposed to fewer high fee TXs. FX rate also plays a part -- more users generally means higher price.

Only buy originals from the manufacturer? No different to trusting a newly purchased Trezor. Heck, the counterfeit Opendime might not have the private key on the device at all -- you won't know for sure until you try and move the coins (or does it eg sign a unique message when initialised?).
If receiving funds in the form of Opendimes, best to immediately move the coins (which, I agree, somewhat defeats the purpose).
I must admit, they seem like more of a novelty item to me (because of the counterfeit problem).
@_date: 2016-08-17 06:31:32
Presumably for the same reason we're assuming 20GB blocks in the other scenario.
I'm with you, I think blocks must increase in size. I just don't know why it hasn't happened already. (I suspect it has something to do with the attack vector SegWit introduces ie someone creating nearly-too-big blocks with lots of witness data, but that hasn't really been spelled out).
@_date: 2016-08-02 11:38:46
Not sure I understand your point. Why would a move to 2M lead you to the "only a few computers storing your $100,000 transaction" conclusion?
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:58:46
None of the proposals were activated, so there were no forks. Now there seemingly will be a fork, regardless of miner support. No threshold trigger, just a date. Could end very quickly either way or we could end up with two coins, I don't know. Just pointing out that the conversation seems to have moved from 'if' to 'when'.

Yes, her Bitcoinmania series on Alphaville is (for the most part) cringe worthy. Some very well-written, and clearly well thought-out pieces, yet often based on or containing technical errors, omissions or misunderstandings. She can be quite stubborn in her beliefs, and very defensive, so there's little point trying to correct her.
That said, I think she's an interesting person and she may not be incapable of changing her mind (even on Bitcoin, though not any time soon). She actually came across quite well on the recent Bitcoin Uncensored interview a few weeks ago (check it out on Soundcloud). Still the Queen of Buttcoin though (an official title they bestowed upon her once).

Fair. Hashrate has decided. Hashrate gets to decide unless and until the economic majority is willing to come together and seriously threaten/use the nuclear option. Clearly that's not happening.
So we go into the halving with 1M...
@_date: 2016-04-19 10:52:08
On the opposite end there's a bizarre yearning for a lightening network with massive central hubs and, at the same time, very expensive main chain transactions that only suit big banks and corporates.
There's a middle ground somewhere, balance to be had.
This sort of rhetoric helps no one.
@_date: 2016-04-17 15:07:15
Huh? Go look at the numbers and work out what the max capacity could be (taking a SegWit best case scenario) in 12 months.
I have zero doubt the devs are working hard on capacity increases and a million other things. That doesn't change the position we are now in.
@_date: 2016-08-01 11:34:03
Thought experiment: a non-contentious  (by which I mean Core was on-side) can kick was effected in early '14, with miners using soft limits to slowly grow capacity. 2M or Adam Back's own 2-4-8 suggestion. No huge divide in the community. No secret meetings. The two years since being much more productive. Would the Bitcoin eco-system - and public perception - really have been worse off than today? Would Bitcoin really be more centralised? Personally, I doubt it. One thing we can be reasonably sure of: Bitcoin would still be growing.
@_date: 2016-08-17 10:12:14


Much depends of how you define success. With very high fees, there's a risk the main chain becomes the preserve of the rich / corps / governments. If they come to represent the economic majority, they effectively gain control of the protocol.

Careful what you wish for. If all wallets have amazing fee prediction algos, the fees shoot up to push people out. Keep in mind that this is skewed by eg BTCC giving priority to all its customers (all txs included in the block it mines, even zero fee). If more big miners and pools do that, there's even less space for txs competing on fees...
@_date: 2016-04-17 08:23:30

I would agree under normal circumstances, but the halving in July is not normal circumstances. No one knows what will happen. 1.3 or 1.5 or 1.6 or more might be _needed_ and we might not get it in time. Or it won't be needed at all. We're all in together and we'll find out in a few short months.
@_date: 2016-04-15 13:19:09
Responsible scaling would have involved an increase the max block size a year or more ago. Not doing so was irresponsible for two reasons: (1) Bitcoin is now vulnerable to a relatively cheap attack of filling very nearly full blocks and (2) Bitcoin can no longer match the growth of previous years. There's no good reason for the years of delay and inaction that led to these results.

Things were different back then, but it was a hard fork and it was implemented very quickly. Most full node implementations have alert systems which tell people to upgrade. In an emergency, a hard fork could and would be done very quickly indeed. Heck, the Core devs discussed this recently (in the context of an emergency post-halving). Like I said, ideally (in a non-emergency), sure, give people lots of notice. But two years is way too conservative, even for fairly big changes.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:25:31
Hmm, I think a hard fork will happen way before Peter and co present an actual proposal for consideration. People are (rightly or wrongly) already moving ahead with the idea.
@_date: 2016-04-06 09:22:35
Not really. Most VISA credit cards _pay you to spend your money_ (with rewards and bulletproof consumer protections, at least here in the UK). With LN, you have to pay to spend your money (ie pay to use LN). It'll be like paying $25 for a $20 prepaid card. Great. Then if something goes wrong with a transaction - a merchant who doesn't send goods, for example - you have the rigmarole of trying to get the merchant to refund the bitcoins (ie no calling the credit card company and saying, "refund me and take it up with the merchant").
I'm excited for LN (assuming they can solve the routing problem) but it's important to keep some perspective. LN is not a compelling consumer proposition. Maybe for repeat illegal purchases which are low value and require Bitcoin's security and censor resistance?
I do like the "Ripple" chat higher up the thread though ( -- lots of possibilities there.

@_date: 2016-08-15 15:46:04
I jist wonder if, bigger picture, the barious fees might make it difficult for LN to achieve the critical mass it needs. The admission fee (opening one or more channels to commit funds) and, for those who don't stay online 24/7, these "insurance" fees. It might still be cheap but it feels like another chicken and egg problem for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-05 11:14:21
There may be one or two miners that decide to turn off their equipment because they are no longer making money, but likely very few. Most will have priced the halving into their projections -- they will continue to make money (less, of course, but they'll be making money nonetheless). Heck, miners continue to purchase new equipment, measuring ROI way past the halving.
Keep in mind (OP) that the rewards after halving at today's BTC prices are roughly the same as the rewards were 6-7 months ago (at BTC prices then). Sure, miners were under pressure then, with margins squeezed, but they survived, they continued to mine and difficulty did not drop. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 22:07:42

I did say "opposite end of the scale". I don't think anyone knows for sure how to avoid centralisation pressure or how or why Amazon might accept payments routed through anything other than fully KYC'd mega hubs. Has routing been solved? I know they were looking at building in degrees of confidentiality but I confess I may not be fully up to speed.
@_date: 2016-04-12 21:58:54
We should have forked a year ago. We should absolutely not be in a position where attacks are trivially cheap for such a stupid reason as blocks being almost full.
The argument was always "but but but bigger blocks = centralisation"... then SegWit, which requires even bigger blocks, was suddenly A-okay. Think about that for a second.
It's patently obvious some people _refuse to fork **at all costs**_? Why is that? What good reasons have you heard? The result has been literally years of inaction, despite two(!) scaling conferences. Pretty dire IMO and small wonder three (regardless of what you think now) very respected Bitcoin devs felt the need to break away and support alternative implementations. Hugely frustrating for them and many, many others.
I'm not saying "sky is falling" but the inability to increase the block size in all that time is pretty damning.

Miners' entire business model depends on bitcoins having value. Value is determined by users and the businesses and services that serve them -- most obvious being the buyers and the exchanges they use.
Bitcoin inflation is currently $1,484,105. That's a lot of people buying bitcoins every single day (i.e. to keep the price stable-ish at $420 -- even if miners don't sell all their newly minted bitcoins).
Quite how you measure the will of the economic majority, well, I don't know. Node count is very far from perfect. Shouting on the Internet doesn't work. Which means in order to be heard, the economic majority would invariably need to take drastic action.
@_date: 2016-08-01 06:41:39
Every hard fork will be contentious to those that don't want it (and there will always be those that don't want a particular hard fork).
Ethereum was slightly different because of the way the difficulty adjusts; it meant miners could freely switch between ETH and ETC with no penalty and there was no real impact (for users) on TX processing, etc on the low hashrate chain. This could not have happened with Bitcoin without (at the minimum) careful management of the difficulty on the low hashrate chain (and, I suspect, a change in the PoW algo too). Very different scenario IMO.
That's not to say that two chains could not ultimately survive, but much less likely and much more work than Ethereum.

@_date: 2018-01-10 17:55:55
Right, but if there is always block space scarcity, there is always the possibility of someone bumping average fees higher by "spamming", intentionally or otherwise. That can't be policed because "spam TXs" and bona fide fee paying TXs can't be distinguished (unless you want to start censoring TXs that you believe to be spam, but I don't think we want to go there).

Isn't the 1.6-2M based on 100 percent of the network using SegWit? I thought the more realistic projections were 1.3-1.5M during 2016, or have things moved on? Not that we need 2M or even 1.6M immediately, but the time around the halving could still be v interesting. All sorts of trading, miners selling more coins, etc.

Yes, there's SegWit, of course, but that 1.6M will require release, activation and broad implementation. Do you think activation will happen in time? I guess the miners/pool admins are motivated but soft forks can still take weeks or even months to activate. Could be cutting it close.

His comment re difficulty is important. I also think Bitcoin miners would be more likely to mess with/kill the minority fork. So the minority would likely have to change its PoW algo too. They'd end up with a different coin, albeit with Bitcoin's TX history, but vastly less secure.
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:16:47

Yes, save that the dips used to recover to higher highs, now they don't.

Reality shows that Bitcoin is so small and insignificant (in capital markets terms and, frankly, in most other terms too) that nobody cares enough to spend a measly few $million to make Bitcoin pretty much unusable.
Reality shows SegWit won't be activated for months. So I guess it's a good thing that...
Reality shows Bitcoin growth is now stunted (vs previous years -- it literally can't grow at the rate it did last year or the year before). For no good technical reason.
If we get through this and no long term damage is done, great, but it will be luck and not good planning.
Of course, we are where we are, so now we band together and hope for the best.

Sure but no one wants "too large blocks" or "contentious hard forks".
My point was only that Bitcoin with permanently full or very full blocks will not work. Quite apart from anything it's anot amazingly cheap DoS attack. Imagine the damage a few million $ could do. Consider also that fees were increasing (read: a natural market was developing) before full blocks! Why was that?
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:32:12

@_date: 2016-04-18 23:10:57
No one knows what will happen and that is rather the point. 
For argument's sake ("FUD" warning for those who are hyper sensitive): the halving happens, there's a bunch of speculative trading but the price trends down, the people betting on gains begin to cut their losses, price falls further, miners start to sell way more coins than they usually do to compensate for their reduced (and quickly reducing) income. More panic selling except now coins are getting stuck too. It turns out 1.whatever wasn't enough. People now paying ever higher fees to get out. A vicious circle as miners start to really feel the pain. Price basically crashes. Some miners stop hashing, blocks now taking longer to find*. More entries in the Bitcoin Obituary pages. Cheap coins!
*Thankfully, Core has a plan for this eventuality -- an emergency hard fork that, amazingly, can be rushed out quickly, yay! 
Or it could be a non-event. But I'd rather the devs plan for the worst.
@_date: 2016-04-18 22:44:57
The thing to be decided has to be sufficiently serious for the users to actually exercise their power though, right? Otherwise there's just a bit more noise for the miners to consider when making the decision to implement devs proposals. I think the miners would rather know for sure what the econ majority wants, but there's no good way of measuring that (unless it's something crazy like lifting the 21m limit, which would cause an uproar).
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:05:11

I mean that access to payment and settlement facilities for poorer people tend to be _more expensive_ than for other people. One of those unfortunate facts of life. Poorer people are forced to use more expensive prepaid cards while most get free banking (at least here in the UK). I'm not talking about LN here (although if LN truly takes off, it wouldn't be a giant leap to see Bitcoin banks provide poorer people (that can't afford on-chain fees -- which would be most of us if fees climb into the hundreds) with access to pre-loaded LN wallets).

I can't even say "Core compatible" now, FFS :)
Greg Maxwell (he doesn't speak for Core, or any other Core compatible implementation of the Bitcoin software, I know) says full blocks and block space scarcity are the natural state of the Bitcoin blockchain. I would tend to agree. You?
Saying, "get used to high main chain fees now, because they aren't going anywhere" is not Big Block propaganda. It's what most true Bitcoin maximalists are saying.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:57:08
I get all that, but the expectation is still that users will need at least a couple of channels open and, unless they get paid in LN (very possible, once exchanges get on board!), topping up will require on-chain TXs.
I'm cautiously optimistic but I also wonder who would pay $20 just for the privilege of using the system. It would be like paying $20 for a zero balance VISA prepay card, then having to top it up with spending money. No one does that. (I will btw, but I have money to burn (ha) and I will set up an LN node, etc.)
Hopefully we get to the point where exchanges implement LN and new users can receive funds directly to (empty) open channels. Right now, I can only recommend BTC as a buy lots and hold long proposition. I am forced to recommend ETH or LTC or (heaven forbid) BCH if people just want to dabble with crypto, because the BTC fees are way too high for playing around with. That's a couple of Bitcoin's network effects dying right there...
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:37:37

@_date: 2018-01-10 13:29:34
That's fine and well understood. My comment was more about mass adoption and network effects. The open channel fees are a friction that could prevent mass adoption and stunt network effects. I think someone said it would take 90,000 transactions to whittle the average fee down to extremely cheap _satoshi_ levels. Maybe there's nothing we can do about that, but just a reminder that the expectation was, rather amusingly, that fees would not breach $1!

Bitcoin has not suddenly created lots of power stations. They were already there, creating power. (If it did lead to the creation of power stations, it would very likely be in the renewable energy space -- since miners target the cheapest power possible.)
Maybe if we see people going without electricity because Bitcoin miners are sucking up all the power, then we'll have a problem, but arguing that we should shut down Bitcoin, and deny its existence as an innovative tech and the positive impact it may ultimately have, merely because it uses electricity, is nonsensical.

There's a big difference between a fiat on/off ramp being a "hub" and an entity actually sitting in the middle of Bitcoin transactions being a "hub". Imagine, for example, that LN couldn't find a route to X other than through Y hub, but Y hub requires detailed information about TX origination. (My understanding is LN intermediaries don't get to see who originated the TX or where it will ultimately end up, but in hub and spoke that might not be the case.)
Anyway, some LN proponents have been insisting that LN will not be hub and spoke and that the tech has advance beyond that model (I recall tweets by Jack Mallers(?) for example, the guy working on the Zap LN UI). I don't know that answer, but somebody must.

I can kinda see the point, but doesn't this suggest that in a perfect market, with lots of well-armed arbs, there should be no such thing as going long or short, rather "futures" should have one price, being the cost + carry cost?
People go long because they think the market is currently under-pricing an asset, or short because they think it is over-priced, surely? Quite possibly based on no new information, which makes it pure gambling, but you can't say it is not a prediction of future price.
I know someone who is trying to short Bitcoin purely on the basis he thinks "it's a bubble". That's a bet on the future price, pure and simple.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:32:21
That's only part of the problem though. If you want 100% adoption (which you shouldn't really expect, given that SegWit was always opt-in and was expected by many to be adopted only slowly over time), you need to get the people moving coins _to_ Coinbase to use SegWit.
Core and its code are relied upon because Core is the reference client. Not surprising many wallet providers are waiting to see how Core implements SegWit.

I agree, but perversely security means zip if the only people using the main chain are corporates, banks, governments, etc (because they then get to set the rules for everyone else) — very much the worst case scenario, but nevertheless a logical conclusion of stretching out the policy of pricing out “unimportant” TXs.

That has certainly been the situation so far - spikes in TX volume followed by calm periods - but what happens when we get genuine mainstream attention (which this is starting to feel like)?

I hope not. Bitcoin is an entirely different proposition to the one I found in late 2012/early 2013. The price is great, but that’s all that’s great. It used to be about more than price. I’m excited for LN and things like Schnoor but i doubt we’ll see them/any impact in 2018. That’s another year of speculative investment status only, high fees and zero reasons to actually use bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:32:41
I still say it's not unreasonable now. :) High level assessment:


Only for so long as (reward x FX rate) increases, which is not guaranteed. Fees will also need to pick up any slack as the block reward decreases; users' tolerance for increasingly high TX fees is almost certainly capped.

Bitcoin is arguably over secure now (meaning it can expand greatly in terms of capacity and TX volume without needing the hash rate to increase). Some people seem to be under the impression that hash rate must increase to support more TXs / mainstream adoption -- not true.

Not sure who you’re arguing against? I don’t disagree with any of that. I was merely saying that we need to be careful that the end result is not to simply hand over Bitcoin to the already rich, corporates, banks, etc. Let’s face it, there are likely long term HODLers that would let that happen because, frankly, it would be in their own best (financial) interests.

I agree with the point, and I recommend everyone receiving bitcoin runs their own full node, but... Satoshi is one of the people who said that ultimately users could just be users and wouldn't need to run full nodes.

Do we need energy consumption to go down? I don't think so.
The rewards from mining will reduce over time. Energy use will ultimately be determined by TX fees, which will be determined by how much people are willing to pay to use Bitcoin. That number can't go up forever, regardless of Bitcoin's price, so energy consumption is more likely to plateau than keep rising.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:51:21
In case it wasn't clear, I said "naturally capped", meaning that people will only pay so much to use Bitcoin. Who knows what that figure will ultimately be, save that it will be determined by demand and supply/block space scarcity. The market will find the right price, and the bigger the market, the less susceptible Bitcoin will be to short term volatility.

True, but it would be 2.xMB equivalent max, even with 100% adoption. And have you transacted recently? _SegWit_ TXs are already expensive, even though they benefit from competing with larger, more expensive _legacy_ TXs. I doubt SegWit adoption will make a discernible difference to the OP's concerns.
Adam Back promoted 2-4-8 a few years ago (which, with hindsight, bigger blockers should have supported!). It was a conservative option that would have given us up to 8MB blocks by now (or 4.xMB equivalent/8MB weight with SegWit).
Maybe it's just impatience on my part, but I suspect we'll be lucky to see Schnoor and sig aggregation in 2018. LN too (in any meaningful sense). Hopefully I'm wrong on that, because Bitcoin is near useless for anything other than HODLing in the meantime.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:27:15
Evidently _customers_ weren't using SegWit, or if they were, their payments were still failing. (It's not like SegWit guarantees next block -- the wallet still has to guess an appropriate fee or overpay). When payments failed (SegWit or not), no surprise that the insane levels of recent volatility caused issues.

That is based on a massive oversimplification -- it does not recognise that Bitcoin can support way many more TXs without needing the burn more energy (which would change the Bitcoin energy consumption per TX calculation) and it does not account for the MASSIVE infrastructure required to support VISA _settlements_ (as opposed to the mere messaging system).

It's not about coffee and games. What you are actually saying is "_transactions under $x should be priced out because they are not important enough_". Think about what that means _long term_ (particularly if the main chain does not scale). It means the main chain will be used _exclusively_ for the world's largest and most important, high fee paying TXs -- in other words, it becomes the exclusive preserve of the mega rich, corporates, banks and governments (and maybe a tiny handful of Bitcoin barons). You think mere mortals will be allowed to open and close their own LN channels? Pft.
If you think this is rbtc inspired nonsense, go listen to the noded podcast with Saifedean Ammous as guest. The only thing he doesn't say is how Bitcoin avoids becoming KYC/AML coin once the main chain is completely controlled by the mega rich, corporates, banks, etc.
@_date: 2015-12-22 11:39:33


Trust in banks is at its lowest point in decades (and none of the TXs you are talking about are visible to the public under the current system), but it doesn't matter -- this isn't about how many employees a bank has, or how many transactions are automated, it's about a requirement to transact using legal tender.
For Bitcoin to take hold, a government would have to give up its monopoly on money creation. Why would they do that, absent a catastrophic meltdown? I don't see it happening in my lifetime -- do you?
I broadly agree with the rest -- banks will scale down and banks' internal transactions, interbank transactions and maybe some b2b will likely occur on a blockchain and be automated in some way. I'm hoping banks conclude that (a) a private chain is unworkable and only creates more risk and (b) a public chain, being Bitcoin, or a chain or chains linked to Bitcoin, is the way to go.
(It's very difficult for a bank to make that determination now, though, because Bitcoin _is not ready_.  It is years away from being ready. It needs scale beyond what is currently planned. It needs fully implemented LN and 2 way peg side chains to allow for smart contract features. I think we'll get there. Ideally banks would fund development, but they seem to be more interested in private chain solutions for now -- not surprising, since they seemingly help maintain the status quo.)

The official source document requirement is BS, but whatever. Some valid questions that I haven't seen answered anywhere (important given the expectations, particularly after the recent demos).
Re  can a channel receive funds regardless of its balance? So let's say I open a channel with friend A for $20 (i.e. we both have to open a channel covering the whole amount, in this case $20), and eventually I pay him/her $15, so I have $5 left in the channel, can that channel be used to receive payments from friend B that might total $30, or would I have to somehow top up or open a new channel because of the "whole amount" arrangement between me and friend B?

I can totally see loans happening (in some distant future, worst case scenario where the main chain is too expensive for regular folk), with pre-funded LN channels being provided by "banks" to "customers".

The price could go to zero?
I hold a small number of bitcoins, and occasionally spend and re-buy, just because, but I wouldn't gamble my life savings on Bitcoin succeeding or even maintaining its current price.
And why would I jump through hoops to convert to bitcoins each month before jumping through more hoops just to spend them? I get paid in local currency straight to my bank account, the money is (in all but the most extreme of circumstances) safe in the account and I can take it out any time and use it (locally) everywhere.
I'm a big Bitcoin believer but it's a million miles away from replacing local currency for me. In particular, Bitcoin does not make wires obsolete -- because none of the people I wire money to accept Bitcoin. Chicken and egg scenarios everywhere you look.

I'm really not doubting the enormous amount of regulatory red tape financial institutions have to deal with, or the fact they are fairly conservative (publically -- behind closed doors they do all sorts, hence the huge fines they amass), but there are (to my knowledge) no regs that say banks A and B can't choose to transact in bitcoins.
None of the bullet points above are relevant to banks A and B, who are both heavily regulated and know each other well, transacting in bitcoins.
Regarding roll back, I get that, but you go on to give a perfect example of how "roll back" really isn't that important (HSBC and its laundered billions -- none of those TXs were "rolled back"). It never ceases to amaze me how criminals are able to move money from regulated bank to regulated bank and yet somehow it eventually goes missing (and I don't mean withdrawn in cash). A global financial system which is a shoddy patchwork of rules and software will always allow this.
Education is key and hopefully regulators - with help - will come to realise the potential benefits of public blockchains. That's their job, after all.

Are you sure? SegWit appeared out of nowhere are promises up to 4x. There are all sorts of optimisations being worked on and, I dare say, all sorts of optimisations that people have yet to come up with. Then I look at where we were in, say, 2000. I was on 56k dial-up (I'm now on 120Mb cable) and my laptop had maybe 16Mb RAM and &lt;1GB HDD. Let's be honest here, Bitcoin is scalable way, way beyond any of the block size increase BIPs (except maybe 101, which was quite aggressive). That's fortunate for everyone because it will have to scale beyond (for argument's sake) Adam Back's 2-4-8 long term _just to cope with LN_.


I see the point, I just think optimisations and technological advances will negate the concern. For perspective, the first large-scale public network test of 5G, for example, achieved _mobile internet_ speeds of 3.6Gbps.
I know you say Satoshi's intentions are irrelevant - which always makes me sad - but I do think it's interesting he foresaw the centralisation of nodes. Keep in mind the same probably applies to LN (i.e. the centralisation of hubs).


Miners could collude to take the cap away right now. They would destroy the value of Bitcoin. Personally, I think if Bitcoin reaches scale (by which I mean people actually use it, for whatever reason), there will be plenty of invested parties with enough self-interest to run their own full nodes. Financial institutions, exchanges, corporates, etc -- heck it will practically be a requirement, because it's really the only way of checking the validity of TXs and account balances.


Potentially a problem but again, I think tech will prevail. No one (not even BIP 101 proponents) is suggesting an immediate leap to huge blocks. (Just to be clear, I'm definitely not saying 101 is the answer either, but I am saying 1Mb or 2Mb or even 2-4-8 will prove insufficient long term -- whilst I appreciate the conservative approach, zero bump now seems to me to be just about the riskiest option. In short, I agree with Jeff Garzik.)
One more think on LN -- it's really very promising but the whole idea of opening and closing channels (standard TX to open, standard TX or wait-it-out to close), and having to commit funds for the life of the channel (which again, may be a wait-it-out situation) makes it wholely unsuitable for a whole range of TXs. That is, you can't just whip out your LN enabled Bitcoin wallet and pay for something new and have the TX confirm immediately. You have to first set up a channel and commit funds. That won't work for a lot of people. (Not the standard Bitcoin TXs are any better, but I think this point is sometimes lost.)
Anyway, we are where we are. It is what it is. Yada yada yada. Merry Christmas!

If you want to be a citizen of a nation in which its citizens pay taxes, then you have to pay taxes. Why? Because those taxes pay for all sorts of benefits and protections for all its citizens. It would not be fair if some citizens chose not to pay taxes. Hence it was decided long ago - by the citizens, no less - that not paying taxes would be a punishable offence. You pay your taxes to remain a citizen of that nation. There are alternatives (other nation states that don't have taxes, a traveller's life, etc). Something tells me you will choose taxes and the benefits you derive rather than looking elsewhere. (And if you think you were unlucky to be born in a tax paying nation, jeez, first world problems.)

Hmm, these are exactly the sort of blanket statements I had in mind. I have no doubt at all this is what bank executives say, but I don't think these arguments have been properly considered. Maybe I am missing something.
Taking the example of interbank settlement...
"Censor" -- What does that mean for a particular bank? What are the regs/risks that require "censorship"? Presumably, censorship in this context is simply the ability to prevent payments to or from a particular person... but for a bank, that just means not paying someone or freezing any funds that it receives from that person. Those are easy -- it is nothing more than blacklisting. In fact, it would be more difficult in a global private chain, because participant banks might unwittingly process a payment or otherwise validate a payment by another bank subject to some form of censorship (big liability risk for participants).
"Roll back" (by which I assume you mean reversing transactions). Important to remember that transactions today can only be reversed for a limited period of time (we have settlement finality rules -- we do not have a rule that says TXs need to be reversible for x period of time). After that, the only way to reverse transactions is with the consent of all parties ("consent" may be required, for example following a court order in the event of an insolvency), which is frequently what happens. But here we're talking about a limited number of financial institutions transacting with each other, so not sure where the insurmountable risk lies. Possibly a "fat finger" risk, but I would argue internal controls could be made much stronger with Bitcoin (using highly restricted wallet software, incorporating multisig, using fixed payment channels and, eventually, highly automated transactions using smart contracts).
"Restrict access" -- Again, what does that mean for a particular bank? They either pay funds to another bank or they do not. It's simple KYC, with whitelisting and blacklisting. It becomes a matter of internal controls.
Maybe I am missing something obvious, in which case always happy to discuss and learn.
(I do recognise that none of the above means a conservative bank will change its views - I am just saying it's unfortunate, given the incredible benefit of the core idea behind Bitcoin i.e. assuming zero trust and bad actors from the outset.)

It's unfortunate that projects like these soak up talent -- I can't help but think they're a distraction, a bit like altcoins.
I'm not saying Bitcoin should be the only chain (sidechains! Or if banks think they can save money using internal blockchains, great, go for it) but more often than not the reasons given against using Bitcoin are spurious at best. In fact, they often boil down to "Bitcoin bad because Silk Road".
Claiming, for example, that "know-your-validator" is a deal breaker is daft -- it denies the entire working history of Bitcoin. Requiring "trusted parties" and relying on legal recourse to known validators to prevent issues and/or cure them (it will do neither) is entirely the wrong basis upon which to build a network and settlement layer. Indeed, all participants on a closed chain will likely open themselves up for claims should anything go wrong, regardless of the cause, and in all likelihood the chain will immediately fail as a result. Far better to build upon a structure where zero trust is assumed from the outset.
Similarly, dismissing Bitcoin, or refusing to build upon Bitcoin "because regs" or "because operational reasons" is plain lazy -- it merely demands that existing systems be recreated almost in their entirety, without realising any of the benefits of "blockchain". It's an excuse.

Increasing block size does not immediately cause centralisation. Miners will only proceed with increases they are comfortable with, which probably means maintaining a soft limit. The actual limit is headroom. That's the way it has been done to date. The problem is there's no room to nudge the soft limit higher.
@_date: 2015-12-21 17:18:08
I really don't think they see Bitcoin as a threat. (Or they think it will be squashed by their friends in government way before it becomes a threat.) I think they'd happily work with it if they thought it was viable (in terms of TX capacity (it isn't yet) and regulatory compliance (there is enough uncertainty that banks don't want to risk it, not least because of its horrible public image)).
Rather banks are experimenting with "blockchain" for the same reasons they experiment with all sorts of other finance tech -- they want to maximise their profits and they don't want to be left behind by others in the industry.
People pushing private blockchains are saying exactly that: (1) we can save you serious money and (2) the other banks are doing this anyway, and you don't get left behind.
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:33:58
It's a great book.
With Bitcoin, proof of work based consensus requires reward (because if there was no reward, why would anyone do the work?).
With private chains, "consensus" is "achieved" by other means. Rather than rewarding unknown actors (miners) for proof of work, they assume known actors will all act honestly, so no need for proof of work and no need for any reward (or they might cite legal recourse as a deterrent equivalent to a reward for acting honestly). This might work for so long as all the known actors remain uncompromised and continue to act honestly.
Of course private chains still need to record _something_, which will invariably be TXs in their native token (even if they don't call them "tokens").
It seems nonsensical to me, in the face of such incredible innovation (Bitcoin and its alternative "trust" model), to follow the previously well worn path of closed networks that assume honest actors. History tells us this is a weak security model. Far better to assume bad actors from the outset. The threat of legal recourse, for example, regularly fails as a deterrent in the real world.
The only proviso to the above is smart contracts. There is no public chain smart contract platform (Ethereum isn't there yet). The features and potential of smart contracts are compelling, so it makes some sense that banks, etc will experiment with private smart contract capable chains.

I don't think this is true long term. Ultimately, miners will burn most of what they earn. The question is: what will happen to miners' earnings over time? On the one hand, as the price goes up, earnings go up. On the other hand, the reward halves every four years and TX fees will be naturally capped (by user demand/tolerance). When fees form the bulk of the reward, that cap will largely nullify the effect of increasing price (since most users will still be looking at fees in USD terms).

Yes and no. You might guess wrong. Or your wallet software - or the exchange or other service you are hoping to withdraw bitcoins from - might guess wrong (or might not even allow you to set a fee -- as has been the case in the past).
Or a fee that was reasonable an hour ago might not cut it any more. A rapid increase in demand - whether a cheap spam attack or otherwise - will cause this and catch people out.
For me, the fees are nothing. They're pennies (so far -- who knows what will happen if banks actually use Bitcoin as a settlement system). Even if I don't need fast processing, I will pay a good fee. I am lucky though. There are fledgling markets in developing countries where fees mean everything and every fee is a decision.
Ideally, fees would be much more predictable and TXs guaranteed (i.e. wallet software would report with 100% certainty that x fee would be sufficient). Of course that doesn't work and I don't know what the answer is, but saying fee payments are easy and noobs are to blame if TXs get stuck is disingenuous.
(Your post is a good PSA though.)

Obviously fees replace coinbase rewards long term -- no one is suggesting otherwise. Nor are people suggesting that "zero fees and instant confirmations" were ever part of the deal. But surely the intention was to reward miners with _a very large number of low fees_ as opposed to _a small number of high fees_.

In order to create the fee market some people want to see, there will necessarily be a god awful user experience that drives fees up i.e. no certainty on minimum required fee, transactions failing and users' bitcoins being tied up as a result. Quite how people don't see that as being a problem, I don't know. In fact it makes rapid user growth a worst case scenario, because the problems would be exasperated. Bitcoin would be dismissed as broken software that is unable to scale properly. Pretty reckless, in my mind, for people to want to test "fee markets" in this way without at least preparing the infrastructure first e.g. deciding how user wallets should deal with the inevitable clusterfuck and updating them in good time.
I'm leaning towards a modest increase as a temporary measure - 8mb? And why not set a minimum fee while we're at it, do away with free transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:40:40
Everyone thinks the blocksize will need to increase at some point. The disagreement is about when and how. The current arbitrary limit is insufficient; it won't even support the various off-chain options being touted (since they too will require periodic Bitcoin transactions).

This is a red herring IMO.
First, any asset of significant value issued on the Bitcoin blockchain will have T&amp;Cs attached. Those T&amp;Cs will cover all sorts of scenarios, including the extremely unlikely scenario of someone compromising the entire Bitcoin network just to attempt a double spend or denial of transactions. Bitcoins-as-assets type transactions _are_ reversible, because following such an attack the issuer simply says, "we're reverting to block X as the record of ownership" and issues replacement tokens as necessary. T&amp;Cs will cover this and investors/buyers/sellers will (effectively) sign up to those T&amp;Cs.
Second, for anything of value a buyer will use multi sig escrow, or at least a very well established exchange, and wait for an appropriate number of confirms, before committing funds. The seller will almost certainly be fully ID'd, one way or another. Keep in mind the seller will also have had to acquire whatever it is he/she wants to double spend.
Third, consider that clearing and settlement systems routinely exclude liability for all sorts of things e.g. hacks, downtime, etc. Knowing the identity of the clearing or settlement system rarely provides another avenue for recourse.
NASDAQ would not be messing around with Open Transactions of the Bitcoin blockchain if these things were issues.

@_date: 2015-12-30 18:42:59
My point was block size - in particular the tiny size bumps people are talking about - are the least of your centralisation concerns.
Losing a few relay "full nodes" on very slow connections really isn't a big deal (if it happens at all). Certainly none of the miners/major pool owners seem overly concerned.
Issues with mining centralisation and the stratum protocol do need to be addressed mid to long term -- and I think they will be. It is perhaps not in focus right now but there are people kicking around ideas that seek to address mining centralisation.
EDIT: Since you asked: I didn't sell at $1,000 and I won't when we reach $1,000 next. I don't have many (10s rather than 100s or 1000s), so I use (and replace) them whenever possible and try and grow my stash. I fully intend to pass them on with my estate.
@_date: 2015-06-14 06:17:12
Presumably you think reducing the blocksize would increase decentralisation?
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:35:39

You have no idea. A ten cent fee is a pretty big deal in a lot of places.
Consider for a second that if Bitcoin is co-opted by banks and rich people and used for high value TXs (which some investors want to see happen), we'll probably see nonsense like this posted:
"I've been paying about twenty bucks a tx and have had zero problems. Who are these people cheaping out on fees?"
@_date: 2015-06-17 10:58:05
Disagree. Yes, we want fees to (at least in part) support miners long term, but ideally that comes from growth i.e. more txs, higher bitcoin price. If Bitcoin doesn't work as expected i.e. you try and send bitcoins with a small fee, it doesn't get processed, you have to resend and adjust your fee, possibly more than once, people will quite righly consider Bitcoin not fit for purpose i.e. broken and they will permanently abandon it.

I think you need to stress two things (after you're done explaining what it is and how it works!):
(1) The genie really is out of the bottle - in the AML/KYC context, this means accepting that private, p2p transactions will happen and that AML/KYC will necessarily end at the gateways between fiat and Bitcoin. That's not a bad thing(!) and it's not incompatible with current AML/KYC rules.
(2) The genius of Bitcoin itself - the breakthrough invention! - is the distributed consensus mechanism. It means that Bitcoin is an open resource, it exists right now, it has better-than-Google up time and (for all intents and purposes) has never been "hacked". Bitcoin isn't going anywhere and it allows for the seamless transfer of value in a trust-less environment. Point to 2007/2008 as a reminder of what happens when trust breaks down. Banks and regulators will naturally look for closed systems, reversible transactions, etc, but the reality is Bitcoin's decentralised network can provide extremely safe and secure solutions (albeit much of it in development - the last year alone has brought multi-sig and HD wallets, for example). Consider multi-sig for big transactions, effectively requiring sign-off from x, y and z - potentially revolutionary from a compliance perspective.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:05:19
Right, but why leave the artificial limit in now, when there is simply no need? We're still in the bootstrap phase; even after the upcoming halving, the reward is more than enough to maintain sufficient hashrate. We should be encouraging users (new and old) _now_ and for the next few years at least, and the *network effects* they bring, before letting a _natural_ fee market develop (or looking at other ways of rewarding miners). SW and LN are great, but they are not here now and they are not enough on their own long term. The min block size simply will increase -- why on earth not do it now?
@_date: 2015-12-29 12:34:47
I don't know database tech particularly well -- are there databases where only the "owner" of a particular balance can "transfer" all or some of that balance to another user? Surely the benefit of chained TXs with public/private keys and chained blocks is the creation of digital bearer assets controlled by their owners. The ultimate expression of that is Bitcoin, of course, and I'm certainly not suggesting private chains are particularly secure (which necessarily calls into question the bearer nature of the asset), but it's still more than just x number of parties controlling read/write access to a shared database, right?
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:09:45
There are so many issues with the idea that I think it will ultimately fail. It needs to happen though (i.e. banks need to experiment, push the envelope and see where they get to -- it's good for the entire ecosystem, even if it is a temp drain on resources).
As it stands, I think it's vapourware anyway. They don't have anything yet. They're just getting banks to sign agreements that say not much more than, "we'll work together", "we'll share IP", "we won't disclose anything". They're right to get the banks onside first but sooner or later they need to show a product.
Some of the big ticket issues are around antitrust and the creation of joint and several liabilities. In my mind, the issues are 10x worse than e.g. perceived regulatory or reputational or technical concerns with using Bitcoin's public chain.
The concept of a share private chain is also fundamentally flawed. Assuming trust from the outset makes securing the network incredibly hard. You have to account for everything from banks that fall out with each other (think 2007 when banks suddenly stopped lending to each other because they simply had no idea who was solvent/insolvent (or perhaps more accurately, which insolvent banks the governments would support)) to employees being compromised or e.g. selling read/write access on the black market. Then there are the myriad regulatory concerns in all the relevant jurisdictions.
Trying to get everyone on the same page and actually launch the thing is also monumentally difficult.
Will be interesting to see where they come out.

The reason given is not centralisation, since people like Back were broadly happy with 2-4-8 etc. The reason given now is they just don't want to do a hard fork and SegWit is sufficient.
@_date: 2015-12-31 11:47:09
Yes but people aren't happy with "will be made later" without a commitment, not least because SegWit _will not be ready in time_ to prevent fee pressure caused by block space scarcity.
The focus for much of the year has very clearly been "how much should we increase the block size by". XT was really just Gavin and Mike trying to focus attention and make something happen. It almost worked except now we have the SegWit switcheroo. The plan to increase the block size has effectively been pushed back indefinitely -- this gives next to no certainty for Bitcoin businesses and the inability to find consensus (even among Core devs) and commit now does not inspire confidence going forwards. Quite the opposite.
@_date: 2015-12-31 15:15:37

It should be no surprise that a lot of nocoiners would fancy their chances shorting Bitcoin \(I have a good friend who is otherwise v sensible, but who admits to knowing nothing about Bitcoin yet firmly believes it will go to zero\), and that a lot of money on the short side might actually put pressure on the price of the underlying \(especially with cash settled\).

Will never fly Ryanair again. They are the only airline in the world that makes foreign passport holders queue at Ryanair desks so Ryanair staff can check their passports (completely separately to the check-in process) and stamp a form. WTF? No mention of it at check-in, so after going through passport control and making our way to the gate, only then were we turned away (by shockingly rude staff - I think they specifically hire people that enjoy being rude). It was complete BS and I firmly believe it's designed to catch people out. We missed the flight because we had to go all the way back to the check-in desks. Four other people missed that flight for the same reason.
Needless to say, no offer from Ryanair to put us on a later flight, so I spent a few hundred £ extra to use another airline. No weird pre-checking of passports required with BA or anyone else.
I don't need to use Ryanair, so I won't. Even if they accept Bitcoin.

Need?  Don't they need more profits?  Isn't that why they continue to charge fees and accept payments by various other means?
It seems patently obvious to me that accepting Bitcoins will, for almost zero investment, net you (1) a bunch of new sales and (2) in respect of existing customers who switch to using Bitcoin, savings on e.g. the credit card fees and chargebacks the merchant would otherwise have to account for.
Saying there is "no need" is simply ignoring money on the table.  It is not good business.

You can achieve the first part (assuming you mean with**out** the consent of party 1) by making it a 4 of 6 multi-sig account and giving 3 keys to party 1).
For the second part (if I am reading it correctly, you are saying party 1 can request the release and if no one responds for one month, the funds are released), I think you'll need rolling nlocktime transactions that move the funds to party 1 after 30 days (i.e. unless the parties agree to effectively cancel the nlocktime transaction by moving the bitcoins to a new multi-sig account (and repeating the process) or they agree to move the coins elsewhere in the meantime).  Not ideal, but possible with Bitcoin Core (using the console).

Educate your customers.
If they see a big, bold "6% off if you buy with Bitcoin" and a link to a very simple description of how to buy bitcoins and how to use them*, you're all set.  Even better if you can put the approx. USD price for those paying in bitcoins in a bigger font right next to the regular price.
You'll get a few new customers (just because you accept Bitcoin) and you'll convert a few customers - meaning gains for you and them - who would have otherwise used PayPal.
*Keep it simple, recommend Circle (assuming you're in the US).  For the purposes of their purchase with you, they can be set up in minutes.  Add a link to bitcoin.org for people who want to learn more.

Ask them about the bad things, then show them another perspective.
Silk Road?  A multi-million dollar market with trades transacted in Bitcoin.  Proof positive that one of Bitcoin's most basic functions (i.e. as a currency and transfer of value) works flawlessly for international trade without banks, without fraud, without ID theft and without credit card fees.
If you get the "yeah but money laundering", remind them that not only was SR shut down, the bitcoins were found, confiscated and are being sold to the public by the US government.
Mt Gox?  The issue was no different to other real world scams: if you trust someone with your money, you better hope they don't lose it or run away with it.  Crucially, however, Bitcoin technology allows services to address the trust issue; we're now seeing the adoption of multi-sig technology and custodians who are able to prove their solvency almost in real time.

As each wallet's fee guessing algorithm improves, and we see more use of CPFP and RBF, fees will shoot up quicker. If there's serious demand from people willing to pay very high fees, we could see a hockey stick with vastly more expensive fees. It will be cheap to run a node but wildly expensive to transact. De facto control of Bitcoin will go to those that can afford to transact, whoever they may be. (This is all worst case, of course; hopefully we'll see SegWit or some other can kick capacity increase. That or demand will subside and fees will level out.)

He's active on twitter, well worth following.
He gets that Bitcoin will, inevitably, impact capital market transactions, including derivatives.
There are transactions where countless man hours (and associated fees and costs) are burned dealing with the posting of collateral and trying to satisfy regulatory authorities and rating agencies that amounts/securities are sufficiently well protected e.g. in the case of an insolvency.  It's blindingly obvious that Bitcoin could remove all that operational and counterparty risk in an instant (and do so much more for all these types of transactions).
Fortunately, Shadab did a great job of explaining some of those practical applications and implications to the CFTC.

"Bitcoin" and "blockchain" are buzzwords right now.  Everyone in the settlement and payments space thinks something could or should or might happen. I was at a payments event yesterday with reps from across the board (major banks, big corporates, payment processors, settlement systems, consultancies, accountants, etc). There are a lot of people experimenting or at least looking at or trying to keep up in this space. Fascinating really. (Of course it's not all Bitcoin; there are lots of "permissioned blockchain" pushers too, generally working a lot harder to win over clients!)
No surprise that academics and schools are also looking at the tech (they are usually the first to do so). The London School of Economics is just another school with academics and students interested in the tech, the science and the economics.

Halvings do tend to lead to a lot of trading and big spikes in TXs. It's reasonable to expect that blocks will be full by July in any event.

In theory, Adam, Luke and Peter T _should_ have presented their HF BIP by then -- but I'm not hugely optimistic about that.

Making assumptions much? It's one thing suffering delay because of bad luck, it's quite another watching blocks get confirmed without your TX even though you paid what _was_ an above average fee at the time.
That said, in its current state (1M/full blocks 4EVA), Bitcoin _is_ unpredictable. The new normal. They probably should accept as much and account for it in their demos. Or (which is starting to sound increasingly more likely and arguably has started), businesses will simply determine that working with Bitcoin is not viable. Then we lose network effects.

In the case of this one experiment, no.  But if they were to settle all their trades this way, and various other exchanges and settlement systems were to do the same (Euroclear, for example, clears ~180million trades/year), the demand for satoshis would soon add up and, perhaps, push the price up.

Is this a ref to LN? I like the idea of LN but I am concerned about the fees to open channels with LN. I'm not sure why anyone would want to spend $10 or $20 or whatever just to do the equivalent of loading a pre-paid card. More likely people would transition to a low fee side chain or alt -- which might ultimately make that side chain or alt a better store of value than Bitcoin.
Obviously a very long way to go, and it will be fascinating to see how things develop.

So you are or you are not running SegWit code? Or are you pruning?

Why do you keep saying this? It's perfectly possible for a hard fork to occur and x users be left behind (i.e. because they didn't agree or didn't act sufficiently quickly). If x is sufficiently small, there is no problem (quite how miners and the rest of the community assess that is another question). Fortunately x's wealth is preserved and available to them on the working-chain-that-everyone-else-accepted, for when they come to their senses or decide to cash out.
By insisting that _everyone_ must agree for a hard fork to happen, you are redefining "hard fork" to suit your needs and suggesting that hard forks are impossible because someone on Reddit suggested that they would never accept it. It is patently false. Presumably you think a hard fork to change the PoW is entirely plausible and possible, despite that, necessarily, not everyone in the community will be in agreement.
Or perhaps you're trying to say something else or I am missing some nuance?
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:23:23
Hash rate matters(!) and ASICs are actually a good thing (they only have one use, which means the incentives for miners to play by the rules are as good as it gets). There may be some centralisation issues but they aren't fatal and they could easily improve (more competition in chip fab and fewer and less dramatic advances in ASIC tech).
Like it or not, a _lot_ of people want bigger blocks. The hash rate isn't convinced (yet) that SegWit is the right way forward (and maybe they're miffed that their HF block size increase requirement has been ignored). None of this is fatal -- it's actually healthy (though of course I wish we could hurry this up and get things moving again). I don't see them going against the apparent will of the network (which is currently signalling 1M and SegWit, given the majority of nodes are Core).
More to the point, if you insist on a PoW change, not only are you abandoning the entire chain security (and creating an "alt" according to rbitcoin), you are also accepting that the game theoretic proposition that is Bitcoin _does not work_ and its security assumptions _are wrong_. After all, if the incentives didn't keep this set of miners playing by the rules, why would it keep the next set of miners (who have general purpose equipment, so even less of a financial incentive!) playing by the rules?
Plan a change of PoW, sure, but let's not do anything rash.

TX and signed message or it didn't happen. ;)
Not really, but I do think it's very easy to adequately secure an HD wallet seed and store it online and offline just about anywhere.  Example:
Electrum gives you what, a 12 word seed?  Split it in two and put each half into seemingly random emails or photos/docs attached to emails together with a word or term that you can search for later.  You can forward the emails all over the place and no one is going to discover the seed. 
Or just encrypt the actual wallet with a decent password (which would be e.g. a hash of a so-so password!).  Look at stealmywallet.com, for example, adequately encrypted and perfectly safe.

An exchange might be tempted to use client fiat funds to buy bitcoins to provide liquidity for people using the exchange to buy BTC. If BTC price then drops and people start cashing out/requesting fiat withdrawals, the exchange might not have enough fiat and can't buy it back because the bitcoins aren't worth as much and/or can't be sold quickly enough.

They assume SegWit will be released, properly implemented and in use by everyone in good time to address block space scarcity and resulting fee pressure. That's an awfully big assumption.

Neutral insofar as I think (maybe I am wrong?) he still supports bigger blocks/flexcap/Bitcore flexcap but was clearly setting out arguments for 1M/SegWit first to show that he's listening and prepared to support whatever the consensus is. Maybe I am wrong and he has changed his mind on this one.
Errors would be statements like "raising the block size limit does nothing to actually improve the throughput" (1M -&gt; 2M doubles throughput) and arguing that because "our own nodes have exhibited strain when the network becomes congested", that's a good reason to reduce the block size (wouldn't that lead to more congestion and therefore more strain?). He also says, "If Bitcoin is over capacity it would not be unreasonable to hold the view that the limit should be lowered". Very confusing.

No one has fixed the scaling issue. Both roadmaps have plans to address "scaling" beyond mere block size increases. Precisely no one is suggesting that block size increases alone is the answer. But _not_ increasing them at all -- that has nothing to do with scaling _and_ it introduces a completely new economic policy to Bitcoin, decided from the top by Core devs. Why not continue to let miners lift soft limits as they see fit -- the way Bitcoin has worked thus far?

Curious about this one -- I thought SegWit required 4M of total space for 1M blocks (though those 1M blocks will hold the equivalent of 1.4-1.8M of transactions, depending on uptake). For 2M blocks (i.e. the hard fork code we're expecting in July), SegWit requires 8M total storage. Have I understood correctly? If so, does this not contradict your statement above? Or are you referring to other roadmap changes that fix this possible SegWit issue.

Yes and no. The economic supermajority is, in situations such as this (ie where the economic supermajority is not quite willing to implement the nuclear option of acting against the miners) _represented by_ the mining supermajority. There is no way around that, unless you start looking at proof of stake type voting.
The problem - if you can call it that - is that we are not quite at crisis point (maybe some believe we are, but clearly we are not). Crisis point (if the conspiracy theories are to be believed) might be at a future point in time where a Blockstream co-ordinated Core is very clearly strangling main chain capacity to try and force LN upon everyone and real users start fleeing to alts. If the miners/pool admins inexplicably continue with backroom deals to support Core, well, that's when we might see the economic majority take action.
In the meantime, the vocal elements of the economic majority can only express their disapproval and hope that the miners listen.

Yes, you could just keep a backup of the Electrum wallet (i.e. the equivalent of wallet.dat), but the seed is the ultimate in terms of recovery.
For example, true story: I was 99% sure I knew the passphrase to my Electrum cold wallet but, for whatever reason, when I came to move some bitcoins months later, I couldn't open it.  Fortunately, I had a backup of the seed (hidden in a big Word document copied to multiple locations).  Without it, I might well have lost my bitcoins.

If it's a choice between $10 off and a 3c fee or 100 air miles worth $1 total, people will be more inclined to use Bitcoin.
At the same time, I think we'll see much deeper social integration.  WhatsApp or Facebook, for example.  Bitcoin addresses in contact lists which make sending money to friends easy, fast and free.
The core benefits (privacy, financial freedom, etc) will become clear for all in good time.  By then, it will be impossible to go back.

Bitcoin solves this insofar as it's very easy for you to send your share of the cost to your friend in bitcoins.  Your friend will have to cash out the bitcoins, presumably for Hong Kong dollars at a Bitcoin ATM, then go to a currency exchange to obtain USD to give to the property manager.
In the future, it is very possible that coloured bitcoins, or perhaps tokens on a sidechain, will represent USD that the property manager would accept directly or that could easily be cash out (for example, at a bank or currency exchange).

Because hashrate matters -- it's what sets Bitcoin apart in terms of overall level of security (and immutability, censor resistance, etc). Changing the algo would be like starting afresh -- it's surely the nuclear option (not least because miners wouldn't agree).
What would be good is finding ways of limiting max pool hashrate, and maybe penalising geographic concentration.
@_date: 2016-03-17 12:35:40
Except we did have that whole roundtable consensus confusion about whether the backroom deal was done by Blockstream or by Adam the individual. Clearly the miners thought they had done a deal with Blockstream -- which means Blockstream (plus Peter Todd) was able to commit virtually the entire hashrate of Bitcoin to running one implementation and not running others. How were they able to do this? Merely by promising to submit and recommend a HF BIP. But there have been several HF BIPs already, why would this one be different? The obvious conclusion: miners think Blockstream exerts considerable influence over the direction of Core. I'm not saying this is proof of anything -- just pointing out that it arguably contradicts the "Blockstream does not submit code" point.

Fact rarely appreciated about the financial crisis and so-called sub-prime mortgages is that many of those loans were given to high income earners.  They were "sub-prime" not because they were given to unemployed/low income earners, but because the terms of repayment were so incredibly burdensome.  People were caught out because they took the loans on the understanding they could re-negotiate the terms after the cheaper-than-cheap intro period, only for that option to re-finance to disappear.

Lots of levels of security, so it rather depends on the funds at risk.  If you are generally good about not installing crap on your computer or phone, an online (i.e. on your PC or phone connected to the internet) wallet might be sufficient.
Personally, I think a wallet on your mobile phone is fine for most purposes (except for large amounts or long term storage of savings), so long as you don't do something stupid like root/jailbreak the phone.
Take Mycelium, for example.  Solid wallet, PIN protected, with simple backup mechanic involving a 12 word seed.
I also like Airbitz, which is particularly good for keeping track of your transactions.  It's also password/PIN protected and they keep an encrypted copy of your wallet in the cloud, so you can log in from virtually anywhere and restore your wallet easily.  Perhaps a little more trust needed.
Or get an offline device - a cheap tablet or even a Raspberry Pi - and stick Electrum on there.  With Electrum, you can have a watch only version of it running on your regular (online) PC.  If you need to move bitcoins, you can sign transactions by copying them to and from a memory stick (i.e. keeping the device and wallet "air gapped" and offline).  Google for instructions.
Or go the paper wallet route.

To be fair, he's always been big on helping the unbanked and he's made positive remarks about Bitcoin. 2+2 does, in fact, equal 4. This is the very first time he's suggested Bitcoin might not be right for day to day transacting in developing economies.
I don't agree that irreversible transactions are a bad thing, but volatility certainly can be (but I also think it can be managed and, as loops close, will become much less of a problem).
More to the point, he doesn't seem to have the answer either. Ripple certainly isn't it. Nothing else fits, yet, which gives Bitcoin as much time as any other to mature into a viable system.

If you do everything else with cash, why not buy and sell bitcoins for cash?  Use Local Bitcoins or Mycelium and develop a network.

Still a tad disingenuous to say, "your software does not need to be updated if you don't choose to. It will continue working just as it did before". A full node that does not update is pretty much a waste of resources.

When faced with the very real prospect of a hard fork leaving those voters behind, its _highly_ unlikely they will hold out and not support the hard fork -- especially if the change is relatively innocuous (doubling of block size limit, for example, as opposed to changing the inflation schedule).

The "we" behind the recent Core statement not only chose bitcoin.org as the platform on which to publish their (first, only?) PR statement, they submitted it for for ACK/NACK discussion (ha!) on bitcoin.org.
It's a bit like when Adam Back initiated the Bitcoin Unlimited discussion on bitcointalk. It made him look bad, even though he had nothing to do with the other decisions of the mods there. He promptly shifted the debate to _the other bitcoin reddit I'm probably not allowed to mention_ and apologised.

This is what I find so confusing.
Increasing the block size does not require Bitcoin to face-off against VISA. It is not an all-or-nothing, either/or.
Crucially, it does nothing to prevent your preferred use case either (Bitcoin as a settlement system). (If anything, capacity concerns probably push settlement system types away.)
The policy of limiting the block size _in order to make Bitcoin more expensive_ positively prevents its continued growth in key areas such as online commerce. We've barely scatched the surface of online commerce and the idea of a global currency, yet you seem not to mind putting that at risk. Valve looks like being the next big company to support Bitcoin payments, on its Steam platform. Steam FFS! How far we have come in a few short years! Why even risk squashing that use case, and all the users that come with it, in favour of _slightly higher fees that do nothing to promote the idea of a settlement system_?
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:56:18

Assume it's this: 
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:34:33
Their take is that block size and bandwidth represent the same bottleneck. SegWit adds an additional bandwidth requirement for fully validating nodes that request the witness. Core devs signed off on an initial bump to 2MB, but SegWit would require 2MB bandwidth for fully validating nodes _with a 1MB block size limit_.
As best I can tell, however, miners seem to be okay with the idea of 2MB now and adding SegWit shortly thereafter (the Classic approach), so presumably up to 4MB required once SegWit is implemented.
At least this is my understanding.

Proof that Adam B, Matt C, Mark F, Greg M, Patrick S, Jorge T, Pieter W and Luke-Jr (did I get everyone?) exercise significant influence over the direction of Core? I think you only have to look at the minutes of meetings, dev mailing list and commits list to see that.
I'm not saying they are actively working to steer Bitcoin in a way that serves Blockstream - though SegWit does seem to do that - but there is a pretty severe conflict of interest nonetheless. As Luke-Jr says, "technically my customers are the people who pay me to do development."
The same goes for other devs, insofar as most are paid by _someone_, but there is no other example of a controlling majority of devs being employed by the same employer. It's unfortunate and it's dangerous (no matter how honest and sincere they are as individuals, or what their personal motivations are).

I thought SegWit was going to help make fraud proofs possible, but that idea seems to have been lost/forgotten/put on the backburner. I do wonder if that had something to do with the soft fork implementation (technically couldn't do it or just to much work to do in too short a time).

Explains a lot. So a statement by Garzik on the exact point you raised is now "not credible". At least you're consistent. You have more in common with some of the folk in r/btc than you think.


We already _had_ a fledgling fee market. Miners were using soft limits to effectively price TXs, well before full blocks.
Presumably you are dead against SegWit, because it might offer some relief from the fee increasing production quota you seem to favour?
I'd rather strive for (more TXs at lower fees) than (fewer TXs at higher fees) -- the result is the same in terms of total fees, but the former approach positively _encourages_ continued adoption and the latter positively _discourages_ it. It seems premature, to me, to draw a line under the P2P electronic cash plan and aim for BitGold instead. Just IMO.
I don't see the relevant of the debt ceiling debates, sorry.
@_date: 2016-03-04 00:32:50
Lots of nodes have a relay policy that would relay your new TX. Miners will accept it if the fee is high.

If they go hub and spoke, it could be quite centralised. Hubs will be big businesses subject to AML and KYC laws and regulations.
There's potentially another way - a mesh network with lots of users, each of whom might have x number of channels open - but it's much more complicated and not as intuitive. Developers still have a lot (like, most of it) to figure out it seems.
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:41:04
Except in this case, the Core devs recognise and acknowledge that they will, in future, when it becomes necessary for them to do so, adjust the block size. You may disagree with their approach, but that is their approach -- they are central planning.

Not only are the "spammers" paying for the toilet paper, and the miners are accepting those payments, BTCC is actively giving away toilet paper to unrelated customers that use its other services. Keep in mind BTCC is a pool -- meaning its miner members (who miss out on toilet paper proceeds from BTCC's giveaway) don't necessarily benefit from those customers using BTCC's other services.

Just because something is safe in theory, from an engineer's perspective, doesn't mean the world will adopt it. I think he knew that certain individuals within Core, and perhaps some miners, wouldn't want to risk 20M. At the same time, there _should have been a decent increase_, if only to avoid the same argument 12 months later. He probably had no idea we'd have to come all the way down to SegWits measly "1.7Mish if everyone uses SegWit", which won't even last a year.
Anyway, pointless us debating what we think he was thinking. You feel free to assume he's incompetent and shouldn't be involved in Bitcoin dev. Eat up Core's production quota idea instead.

Pedantic. Scaling is, of course, a short, medium and long term concern. But cast you mind back to December - only a few short months ago - it was all about a _short term increase_ to tackle _immediate concerns_ (and people were narrowing it down to 2M or 2-4-8). 
Everyone knows other scaling improvements - weak/thin blocks, SegWit, IBLT, LN, etc - will _also be necessary_ for long term "scaling". They knew that then, they know it now. It is in both roadmaps.
@_date: 2016-03-10 01:07:38
No it does not. (And I said "limit".) SegWit squeezes more TXs into the same max block size. Classic intends to do that too.

@_date: 2016-03-12 00:59:19
Hmm, a couple of related points here.
First, I am sure there have been plenty of ideas put forward by very smart Core contributers that have been shot down reasonably quickly by others. This is not so different -- they were nowhere near merging this into Classic proper, rather they were (still are?) exploring an idea.
Of course Bitcoin developers nowadays like to sunmitigated their constructive criticism by going straight to reddit and twitter to trash the "other side". Things quickly get blown out of all proportion. (This is not a reference to Greg M's response to me BTW.)
Second, and perhaps more to your concern, it would not be a case of the relatively small Classic team taking over the entirety of Bitcoin development. Most if not all contributors to Core would continue _Bitcoin development_ for the good of Bitcoin ie as opposed to ragequitting. Sure, some decisions at the top might be made differently, but I have to imagine the overall level of contribution, review and scrutiny would remain largely the same.
So no, not really.

@_date: 2016-03-03 12:28:03
Me too, but this seems to have been made "very hard" for completely the wrong reasons -- i.e. getting a few very influential Core devs on side (the same Core devs who (a) openly supported a HF just 2-3 months ago, (b) recognise that a hard fork will be required in future, and (c) have put us in a position where blocks are now full and we have to wait an entire month for _a little bit of relief_ via SegWit).
Don't get me wrong, I blame the miners for not being proactive enough, and having an odd _need_ to stick with the Core leadership, even though no less then 3 prominent Core developers felt strongly enough to shift their support to alternative implementations (or in Hearn's case, ragequit), and even though it's obvious to most that the vast majority of Core contributors _would continue to code for the good of Bitcoin in any event_.
And all this to say nothing of the fundamental problem of seemingly _4-5 people making this decision for everyone_!
Anyway, ignore me. Just venting my frustration. :)

This situation is slightly different because Bitcoin has chugged along into a hard limit that was never intended for _what it is now being used for_.
I have zero doubt Bitcoin is resilient and will survive, full blocks or not, spam or no spam, SegWit-first. I agree that "Bitcoin chugs along" in that sense.
To put it another way, though, if this was simply a case of key Core devs choosing _change X_ over _change Y_, I would be much more relaxed. But where block space scarcity and fees are concerned, they get what they want simply by resisting change. Imagine if they had to HF to get that 1M limit in order to force a production quota. I think that's why people are getting a bit flustered. This is new.
@_date: 2015-05-22 16:56:49

Huh? No one is trying to kill Core. Gavin and Jeff have, and Mike had, been very clear about their concerns. FOR YEARS. Core very obviously does not want to increase the block size (or not until LN requires it, which should tell you something). There is a fundamental disagreement there. That is all. Everyone is doing what they think is right. Gavin and Jeff still post to the dev mailing list.


Really? Odd then that they felt the need to _negotiate_ SegWit first with the miners, making various concessions regarding a hard fork, and _insist the miners sign an agreement to only run Core_. At that meeting, they promised miners that LN would bring 100x current transaction fees _per transaction_ and were told that Classic's 75% fork _would cause financial loss_, as if that were factually correct. Backroom dealing at its finest.

LN has enormous potential -- can't wait. Hopefully it soaks up all the coffee TXs. But I might want to make a small TX that _does_ require security, censor resistance and some privacy. If Bitcoin can support that too, why not? Why artificially hold Bitcoin back in that regard?
@_date: 2016-03-11 10:01:40
Offering an alternative implementation with a not entirely unreasonable threshold (75% is a supermajority and is the only way to prevent single (paid for / coerced) miner/pool veto) is not an "attack" -- it is an alternative path that Bitcoin may or may not take.

@_date: 2016-03-15 19:00:12
That is true, but it doesn't explain why he is fine with the SegWit trade-off in its current form (ie for 1M blocks, SegWit uses 2M and allows up to 4M blocks in "adversarial conditions", for 2M blocks that becomes 4M/8M, for 4M blocks it becomes 8M/16M, and so on). That potentially hamstrings Bitcoin and the ability to lift hard limits safely in future.
SegWit has its benefits, but it has some semi-serious trade-offs too. I just wonder if they have been properly thought through.

I think that's a bit pessimistic. Regardless, miners won't wait around. If there's no relief over the next few months there'll be a huge push to get the hard fork done ASAP. There'll be no waiting around for Core to debate the issue. Core already got it wrong forcing everyone to wait this long.
@_date: 2016-03-08 16:48:25




I agree with some of what you say, save that the above statements are not true. You may have a super urgent transaction that simply isn't processed in time because, for example, miners might be prioritising other transactions over yours, regardless of your new fee (BTCC already had BlockPriority long before full blocks were a thing), or you might be in a "fee off" with other TXs that just happen to be paying more at the time each particular block is mined. Bigger blocks would be your friend in these cases.


Desperate to include != rich person willing to pay a big fee. By forcing high fees, you are denying a entire group of people who can't afford high fees. Hopefully a reasonably secure, censor resistant alt steps up for them.
@_date: 2016-03-02 18:15:30
Quite normal.
It takes time for a miner to validate a new block, and all the TXs in it, before they can build a new block with new TXs in it.
So what they do is they use that period of time - time which would otherwise be "downtime" for them - to mine an empty block (since they don't know at that point which TXs in their mempool can go into the new block).
Hence you sometimes see empty blocks and they are almost always discovered very quickly (because once they validate the old block and TXs, then immediately start work on a new _full_ block).

You're talking about the sort of hyper-intelligent AI that hasn't been invented yet.
In the real world, wallets can only look at recent blocks and fees and take a guess at what it might take to get in. Opt-in RBF might make this 10x trickier until everyone opts-in (yay!).
Fees that were fine a day ago, or hours ago, might not be sufficient for the sort of service you were hoping for. There's no way around that.

Nobody is fetishizing adoption over those properties. To claim that blocks can't go bigger than 1M is absurd.

Don't get angry if people don't share your completely new vision for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-12 15:13:55
The roadmap is very carefully worded. For example:


This can be read as a bump to 2MB tops (since they say SegWit may achieve up to 4MB), but only after "[delivery] on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic block size controls, and other advances in technology", and provided that "improvements and understanding render [hard fork] risks widely acceptable relative to the risks of not deploying them [in the opinion of the Core dev team]".
Certainly not something I would point to and say, "the roadmap includes 2-4-8" or "keeping patches for 2-4-8 ready to go".  But that's just my opinion.

That sounds nice but it raises more questions, like: how could the sender choose to route around Big Hub, and why or how would the vendor accept payments routed through someone other than Big Hub with whom they have a commercial agreement?
I'm not saying it's not possible - and FWIW I'm positive on LN for low value TXs (subject to the cost of actually opening LN channels) - just that it seems unlikely. More likely is people using AML/KYC enforcing hubs, resulting it centralisation and opportunities for monitoring, etc.
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:29:18
Right, but lots of inputs, so much larger and necessarily more expensive. The equivalent of recommending $5 for a "normal TX".

I think the point is that once you cross the level of a few cents, most use cases fall away. Online commerce, for example. Why would I shop with Steam, using bitcoins, if each TX turns out to be more expensive than using my credit card? I think the OP is spot on -- we shouldn't be getting excited about Steam if the plan is to squash that use case. Or at least we should be very open that Steam requires x months (years) of dev time and huge LN or side chain uptake.
And if Bitcoin becomes a settlement system, it won't be a case of "a few cents" anyway.
Are you aware that miners in the "consensus" meeting were told they would likely get **100x the current fee _per transaction_** under the settlement system plan? That sounds awfully expensive.

Increasing the block size has been the  discussion point for well over a year. What do you think the conferences were about? Everyone expected it to happen soon. The only delay has been getting _Core developers_ on side, which is really odd when you think about it.
Throw in scare tactics (devs will quit, the other team is inexperienced, the fork **will** cause financial losses (presented as fact by Adam in one of the slides), etc) and promises of vastly increased fees once LN is fully operational and small wonder the miners were _persuaded_ to wait a few more months.

I disagree. The chance the minority chain with 25% of the hashrate _fighting to survive_ over such a simple 1M to 2M change is very low (for all the reasons set out here: 
More importantly, anything higher than 25% gives **one single miner**, such as BitFury, a veto -- even if _everyone else wants the change to happen_. That miner might be paid-off or coerced into blocking the change. That's really not acceptable for something as fundamentally important as _growing Bitcoin_.
75% is still a _supermajority_. That's how we decide difficult decisions in the vast majority of cases in the real world.

Transactions are already pretty small, so not a great deal to compress, and any compression/decompression would def slow down just about everything.  Suffice to say the devs will have thought of this.
@_date: 2016-03-06 12:17:57
Not if the most influential Core devs _didn't want it to happen_. They could stretch out the debate, make lots of excuses, organise conferences and generally make it impossible to get it done.

Because in this instance, it's not make or break. SegWit is, for many, too little, too late, and they have braoder concerns about Core's roadmap. But equally now is not the time for nuclear options (e.g. lower triggers, change of PoW algo).
There's really no good way of measuring economic majority votes. Node count is far from perfect, and shouting on the Internet will only get you so far. So we are where we are. That is why hashrate is all important in this debate.

@_date: 2016-01-12 10:59:01
2-4-8 is not in the roadmap and IIRC Adam Back's most recent comments post SegWit reveal suggested a flexcap scheme would probably be the capacity fix. Has that changed? Is there a new roadmap?
Either way, the concern for many is the order of development. A short bump now removes any doubt before the halving and SegWit's introduction. No bump now leaves big questions about what happens (in terms of block scarcity and fee pressure) at the halving and during SegWit's introduction and (potentially lengthy) implementation phase.
@_date: 2016-01-11 13:27:09
Disagree re user and econ majority support. If open discussions were allowed here, and Bitcoin companies weren't being de-listed from supposedly non-political, information-only websites, I think we'd see much more open support.
XT certainly failed to get all important miner support though, that much is obvious. Thankfully miner support was a pre-requisite.
@_date: 2016-03-03 16:53:08


"Consensus" != 100%. If it did, nothing would ever get done. No HFs, no SFs.
In fact, in Bitcoin "consensus" only requires 51% of the hashrate (with sufficient support of the economic majority, of course).
@_date: 2016-03-01 11:44:08
This would be much, much more expensive attack if miners could simply increase their soft limits temporarily and eat up the fees.

How would a hard fork be any safer later on? I haven't seen this argument before -- is there anything I can read to get up to speed?
Also, the above ignores completely the risks associated with a fee event in the short term, which seems inevitable given that blocks are mostly full already and we have the upcoming halving in July (so more TX volume).
@_date: 2016-03-06 10:07:53
Because blocks are full?

Shoppers do not notice those credit card fees. More often than not, they get airmiles too -- it's like being _paid to spend_ as opposed to Bitcoin's _pay to spend_.
Until Bitcoin-accepting merchants pass on those savings, in full, credit card fees are not a good excuse for upping Bitcoin fees. (Interestingly, cc fees in Europe are about to be reduced to 0.2%. That's very, very low. Airmiles will be worth less, no doubt.)
There are other good reasons to use bitcoins online. Not wanting your name, address and card details to be stored on a million third party servers, for example. Or not wanting to be forced or tricked into subscription payments. Cross border transactions without FX and "admin" fees. Small payments that would otherwise be impossible. Open Bazaar!

We would be in a very different place had the Chinese miners not signed that letter in HK. And just look at the promises those Core reps had to make to get them there... a lot of users/businesses/miners want a block size increase and, I think, were ready to make it happen. Heck even Chief Troll Samson Mow was saying as much in December (he thought miners were ready to ignore Core and do it themselves).
@_date: 2016-03-14 09:06:53
Not really. You're describing a payment channel -- with LN there's lots more parties involved and complicated routing to be done. It depends how development goes but there seem to be two possible modes of routing -- a mesh network of lots of users or hub and spoke. Hub and spoke is much easier to achieve (none of this is easy), but big hubs would almost certainly be big businesses and banks, subject to AML and KYC laws and regulations.

@_date: 2016-03-11 00:40:05
So 51% of the hashrate goes off to produce its invalid chain, then reappears to cause a 144 block re-org. Would the stolen bitcoins and the ASICs used to steal them be worth anything after that? Trying to understand how an attacker might hide this.

@_date: 2016-01-10 14:12:10
If it's released and sufficiently implemented in time to make a difference. Key date is likely the halving -- lots of things happening at once, likely significant increase in TX volume, SegWit hopefully released but probably not widely implemented, etc. Assuming Core remains the dominant implementation, there's an enormous amount of pressure on the Core devs to succeed with their SegWit plan. Fingers crossed.
@_date: 2016-03-02 12:36:25
Thanks. Is the suggestion that Chinese miners would flood the tiny bit of block space available just so they could then claim, "blocks aren't full, they're filled with manufactured spam transactions"? If it is, presumably that's BTCC rather than F2 or Ant.
@_date: 2016-03-03 11:44:19
Slightly disingenuous to see that most disagree -- most of the hashing power had to drag some of the most influential Core devs into a meeting in HK just to _make them plan for a HF_.
The community f'd up by not agreeing a simple HF last year. Everyone would have agreed with a Core-approved HF -- we were oh so close, in fact, until Luke had his SF SegWit idea (which I think was truly unfortunate... great idea but had that not happened we could have been sitting happily at 2M _now_ and safely collaborating on SegWit and other future changes). So near yet so far.

If by "dismantle Core" you mean that Mike wanted to decentralise Bitcoin development, then sure, I suspect that is what he wanted. If you're suggesting something more sinister, you should back it up with something.


Is this a reference to R3? What does R3 have to do with Core or Bitcoin? His "motive" was to get a new job?
 


This is striking. If there was indeed "consensus" after the second scaling conference, Classic would be of little concern. There wasn't. What kind of "consensus" is "maintained" by a select few Core devs and a handful of miners/pool admins anyway? 


Are you sure he was lobbying? I thought he said he was there to promote bloq. Are you suggesting he was trying to get miners to sign agreements to run Classic?
Bottom line, certain very influential Core devs have openly stated their desire to use the block limit for something it was never meant to do -- and indeed that's exactly what they are now doing, without any discussion or any form of consensus or any BIP process. I just find it really odd that people don't question this -- worse, they are so quick to dismiss the concern, even when prominent Bitcoin developers, long-time Bitcoiners and respected Bitcoin businesses all voice it.
We'll see how things go with SegWit. Hopefully it will provide some relief and maybe we can figure out some form of flexcap to avoid this issue going forward.
EDIT: Looks like SegWit just caused a hard fork on the testnet. More testing needed.

So far they have only revealed a fork of Ethereum which, of course, uses tokens. Sure, it's not public and the tokens may not be the primary (or any) incentive for the miners/maintainers, but they are tokens. It's just another endorsement.
@_date: 2017-02-03 09:52:47
Not strictly true. I'm not a BU fan, but BU nodes do advertise their settings (AD, EB, etc). Miners know, broadly, what BU nodes will accept (or what they say they will accept). Not Sybil resistant, or course, but miners can weigh the likelihood of a Sybil attack in their assessment. Obviously everyone running Core is "signalling" 1M.
I think we'll see BU hash rate grow but node support remain flat (i.e. majority signalling 1M), so nothing will happen (miners won't risk forcing an increase). 
@_date: 2016-03-03 19:48:11
Not sure what your point is? 1GB might well be the equivalent of 1MB at some point in Bitcoin's future. So long as the block size can be increased, safely, I don't see a problem.

These are valid, fee paying transactions. They are not wasted space. The "attacker" simply decided to post a bunch of valid, fee paying transactions to show people what permanently full blocks will look like. Now we know: it's a bit shit and it's bad for Bitcoin (and in all likelihood it will be a whole lot shitter if we strive for permanently full blocks).
Take a step back and ask why certain influential Core devs had to be _dragged by miners(!)_ to a meeting and forced to make plans for a block size limit increase. Then consider that two very prominent Core devs felt so strongly that they now support a competing implementation, and another quit Bitcoin entirely because of the impasse. Are you not even slightly concerned or annoyed that Core brought us here: full blocks despite it being completely predictable (Gavin warned about this a year ago!) and avoidable? Yet now we must wait &gt; one month for SegWit, because Core refused to budge. Ever so slightly reckless IMHO. Lifting the limit last year would have been done quickly and easily with 95% hashrate had Core blessed the move.

It doesn't matter. Removing Coinbase (and keeping them removed) was petty in the extreme and reveals bitcoin.org to be anything but a non-political, information-only Bitcoin resource.
It also makes the Core team look bad. They appear to be complicit, even if that's not their intention.
I think I read somewhere Core will get its own website for PR statements and the like -- hopefully true, because using bitcoin.org seems untenable to me.

That's right, ignore the completely ridiculous situation that a relatively inexpensive attack like this can cause such chaos.
All because some of the most influential Core devs decided to set Core and Bitcoin on the path to full blocks.
A non-controversial hard fork, blessed and implemented by Core, should have happened a year ago. Two very prominent Core devs felt so strongly that they're now pushing a HF via an alternative implementation, and another prominent Core dev quit the scene completely.
But no, let's mock Classic.

Right now miners only get to set block size (assuming econ majority support, which BU doesn't have, either signalling larger blocks or running BU). I suppose they could try and force the issue but users would have to follow. Similarly, any other rule changes (block reward, whatever) would also require users updating their nodes to accept those changes or giving miners the power to change those rules. Not sure why people think BU is a complete power grab. It's patently not (yet). All that said, I don't recommend BU to anyone.
@_date: 2017-02-19 08:16:40
If/when SegWit is activated, SegWit TXs will be indistinguishable from old type Bitcoin TXs (except maybe for the slightly lower TX fee). SegWit TXs do not require Lightning; they are simply Bitcoin TXs, spent in the same way as now. Lightning may require SegWit TXs (if SegWit activates).

Are you suggesting the Core devs will abandon Bitcoin if Classic succeeds? Far more likely: they will join Classic (which is, you know, an open source project just like Core!) or Core itself will bump to 2MB and the work will continue.
I struggle to have sympathy for a dev that decides to give up on Bitcoin just because the users/miners/economic majority expressed their collective will.

I guess some of those "invested parties" have changed their minds -- consensus (outside of Core devs) seems to be quickly forming around 2MB bump now, SW later.

Or could it mean that one side - or its most influential contributors - has ulterior motives (i.e. the firm belief that Bitcoin must become a high value, high cost settlement system, and all e-cash use cases must be pushed onto side chains and/or LN)? I hope that's not the case.

SegWit is great for lots of reasons, but a capacity fix is not one of them. It does not "double capacity". It does less than a simple hard fork and it does it too late (we have at least another month to wait for the code, then the SF needs to be triggered, then SegWit needs to be widely implemented).
Unfortunately, even a hard fork would take time now -- because Core has successfully delayed any progress up until this point. That's pretty much the best reason for putting up with SegWit first.
@_date: 2016-01-19 00:12:04
Sure, but if Classic is successful and Core still refuses to bump the limit to 2MB, it'll become consensus incompatible abondonware.
@_date: 2016-03-09 13:43:49
I think you misread what he said -- he was querying "reducing the activation threshold" (from 95% to something lower).
I suppose some miners/pools have said they don't want to be in a position where they are coerced into blocking the activation of a change. Of course that means looking at the largest miner/pool, which is less than ideal.
@_date: 2016-03-10 06:50:28
That is understood, but not sure what that has to do with the block size limit, which is the thing that causes block space scarcity and changes the economics of Bitcoin by not allowing miners to react to increased demand.
The fact that SegWit introduces a strange bandwidth and storage attack vector, which doubles with each doubling of the max block size, is not helpful in this regard.
But yes, I do understand that SegWit uses up the 2M that a simple limit increase would have used. Actually 4M, if you consider the full attack vector. Interestingly, miners seem to think 2M/8M should be fine before July next year (i.e. SegWit SF then 2M HF). Which would be the equivalent of a bump to 8M. Which begs the question what was all the fuss about again?
@_date: 2016-03-03 15:13:44
All good points. I just wish Luke hadn't thought of the SegWit SF. Then we wouldn't be talking about any of these "concerns". And we wouldn't have full/very nearly full blocks. We were on the verge of agreeing at least 2-4-8.
@_date: 2016-03-06 12:29:39

He raises an important point.
The effect of a fee market at 1M is to challenge no/low fee TXs and push at least some of them off the network. It follows that some people will leave Bitcoin for cheaper alternatives. That's fine in principle -- nothing wrong with people at the very edges leaving Bitcoin (although personally I think it's unnecessary at this stage of Bitcoin's development). **But**, no one wants a stampede.
The obvious questions then are: How do we measure "people leaving"? (Relative coin cap might give us an indication.) Who measures it? Who decides _enough people on the edges are leaving and we now we need to stem the flow_? Who decides _how_ we stem the flow?
Experimenting with an aggressive fee market at 1M is okay, maybe, but it certainly hasn't been done before and _at the very least_ I'd want the above questions answered first. Otherwise we risk misjudging, reacting too slowly and having no recovery plan. Look at the current situation: we have an entire month of this ahead, with no plan other than "SegWit in April".
@_date: 2016-03-03 15:04:25
It's a really nice list, and all the contributors to Core continue to do a great job on most things... **but none of those things actually increase capacity, which is what is needed, and which people have asking for for over a year**.
EDIT: And how many Core devs do you think actually go uncompensated?! You do raise an important point though: the people _paying_ the most influential Core devs _don't want to increase the block size_.

Roger Ver was actually quite late to this argument; he only stepped up when this sub started doing what it does in terms of shaping its members' opinions.

Re-read my last response. I explained exactly what the difference is. You seem to be suggesting that SegWit raises the max block size limit, which is **wrong**.


 


Did the miners themselves not negotiate HF code (to lift the max block size limit) to be presented by July '16, with the intention of effecting the HF by July '17? If that max block size limit is increase to 2M, the total bandwidth/storage requirement (in the unusual attack scenario you alluded to) could require as much as 8M total.
@_date: 2016-03-09 17:53:58
I go back and forth on some of these issues too. Taking your points in turn...
1) True but this test was for a mere 3 days and it was clearly carried out by someone who did not want to damage Bitcoin. Permanently full blocks - or actual, long lasting attacks that create them - are a v different matter. For one, all wallets will calculate fees better... which just means rapidly increasing fees, not extra capacity. A more varied bunch of people will miss out.
2) Fee paying TXs are not spam. Those fees are paid to miners who secure the network. If Coinbase wants to pay miners twice to effect one of your withdrawals, there's nothing wrong with that. Query why it takes two TXs -- would you complain if it was a by-product of an added layer of security that protects you as a customer?
3) Things won't settle down if blocks are permanently full. Even if they are not quite full, but nearly full, given the relatively low cost of filling blocks, imagine what a well funded and determined attacker could achieve.
4) Agreed! I'm not that worried either **but** I'm not convinced Core's plan (do everything other than increase the block size limit) is better than Classic's (do everything). Hopefully they will relax a little on the limit, and eventually support e.g. BitPay's suggestion or some other form of flexcap.
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:20:58
True, but it seems to be more complicated than that -- there will effectively be two classes of users, SegWit and non-SegWit, with SegWit users able to pay less in fees for their smaller TXs. That's the change in economics Jeff Garzik was alluding to. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 14:02:14
Might as well go 2-4-8 to give plenty of time to work out whatever flexcap scheme we use long term.

I doubt very much Greg has stopped participating in Bitcoin dev altogether. More likely he gave up his commit access to counter arguments of conflicts of interest within Core, and meant stopped participating in these threads of discussion.
There's lots of vitally important work being done by Core devs -- everyone recognises that (believe it or not) and none of it will be ignored. I expect virtually everything in Core's dev road map will be replicated in Classic* -- SegWit, IBLT, weak blocks, etc. The only thing that won't be replicated is "keep the block size limit at 1MB".
Do you really think contributors to Core will suddenly stop contributing if Classic succeeds? Even in the unlikely event the maintainers refuse to bump Core to 2MB, I think the _development work_ would continue -- the contributors would simply contribute to other consensus compatible implementations (directly or indirectly). I could be wrong, but I think Bitcoin devs work for the good of Bitcoin, not merely for the good of Core.
*If the Classic devs inexplicably drop SegWit, for example, I think we'd see the community quickly rally around alternative implementations that include it.

Fair, but see the other response from Frogolocalypse - he wants to fire the miners just because they are taking their time or refusing to signal SegWit.

@_date: 2016-03-02 17:24:42
Completely agree, of course, I was looking much further ahead. Core's plan (or at least the apparent aim of Core's most influential devs), however, does seem to be "keep block size limit as small as possible, turn Bitcoin into a high cost, high value settlement layer". They could take us there.

I mean Blockstream has its own big VC investors. People tend to see it as VC funded Brian Armstrong and Coinbase vs volunteer Core devs, which is silly.
@_date: 2016-01-12 11:10:53
Agree, but how long do you hold out on the short chain, which is potentially much less secure and soon to be replaced entirely, when you know miners (and at least some users, because miners won't act alone without knowing their newly mined coins would still have value) have moved elsewhere?
Core will hit safe mode and each user will have to decide.

But these are real, fee paying transactions, nothing like your homeless people/teenagers who aren't eating. Fees are spam protection and this attack is only successful because there's close to zero available space in the blocks. A spammer wouldn't bother spending 6x as much filling 2M blocks -- or if they did, their money would run out 6x more quickly.
How would you propose to deal with the "spam"?

Are you aware that miners in the "consensus" meeting were told they would likely get 100x the current fee per transaction under the settlement system plan?
I don't know the truth of this, but 5c becomes $5, plus FX fees for switching in and out of Bitcoin. Western Union starts to look pretty good. (Okay, might still be better than WU.)

Clearly mycelium (the entity/devs) does not hold/transmit anything, so there's nothing to license.  Localbitcoins, maybe, since they hold coins in escrow to facilitate transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-01 11:42:49
People have had to pay for the best part of a year. There was a perfectly natural fee market developing (a proper market where the providers of goods/services actually set the price, and weren't subject to the production quota that is the block size limit).
Pay no fee, your TX is very seriously delayed and may not be processed at all. Pay a small fee, and your transaction should be processed reasonably quickly. Pay a large fee to pretty much guarantee placement in the next block.
@_date: 2017-03-04 09:42:41
BU miners won't mine larger blocks unless they are confident users will follow. If the majority of nodes are still signalling 1M by running Core, miners won't risk mining an invalid chain. In that respect, nothing has changed (no matter how high BU hash rate climbs).

But is the potential shift in focus - arguably back towards Satoshi's original vision - so wildly bad and "not Bitcoin" that you think people would walk away? Forget the 1M branch for a second, because the odds would be very firmly against it surviving for any length of time.
If there was a shift to Classic, it would simply be a statement by the market saying that, "we think Bitcoin dev has become a bit too centralised and we don't think Bitcoin's new direction is the right one, we want to follow Satoshi's original vision". Again, if certain devs balk at that or feel so offended that they decide to move on, well, that's on them. I would hope the vast majority would see this as _Bitcoin working as it should_.

Are you sure that's how their AD/Emergent Consensus settings work? I thought it was only about block size. Changing the inflation schedule would require, at the very least, a new version of BU (and, crucially, users upgrading to that version)?

@_date: 2016-01-18 17:50:55


They're currently committed to the "roadmap", but would be very odd if they remained committed post Core becoming consensus incompatible. They would effectively be developing to have their work replicated in other projects. How long before they _actually work on Bitcoin_?

This is where you're in danger of putting at risk Bitcoin's biggest advantage -- it's network effects. We _want_ people to use bitcoins wherever possible in order to get more bitcoins into more hands. That's really important, especially when Bitcoin is as small as it is. If we draw a line now and say, "hang on, we have enough users for now, let's up the fees for everyone and make sure each user _really wants to use Bitcoin_ for each and every transaction", we might actually stunt Bitcoin's growth and negate its network effects permanently. 


Certainly agree with that.

Ha, well, yes, that is his position. You get an upvote. I just wonder whether he had similar 3 hour calls with anyone _on the other side_.

I think you underestimate him. I think he knew full well the number would have to come down before people accept the change. It was a starting point for discussions and negotiations and it worked (in the sense of actually making _something_ happen), though even he likely failed to guess 1M-&gt;2M would become "controversial". The opposite - digging heals in and refusing to lift the limit at all - was an equally bad starting point, yet Core has stuck to it.

I thought you guys had accepted that "1.75 a month or two from now" is ludicrously, insanely optimistic? (Not that I don't think SegWit will offer some relief.)
Anyway, the article is, rightly or wrongly, less about 1M vs 2M and more about the unreasonable desire of a seemingly captured Core project to limit the block size _unnecessarily and for the foreseeable future_ (and only increase it once they decide they need to for _non-Core related projects_). It really bakes down to a very basic concern: users give bitcoins value, this policy risks discouraging users.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:39:54
And now they accept Bitcoin -- great job Roger!
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:07:00
A couple of things on this. SegWit is not a simple can-kick. It has all sorts of implications. Not saying it shouldn't happen - I support it - but I'm not surprised it's proved controversial. Second, transactions might well quickly fill 2 or 4M but # of TXs x average fee x Bitcoin price would almost certainly be better than the status quo (where there is real evidence that users and use cases are leaking elsewhere). SegWit makes it difficult to get anywhere near 4M short term.
@_date: 2016-01-26 11:19:14

LOL at "Classic has collapsed". It hasn't even be released yet and it doesn't have a termination date. We have no idea where it will go. Even if the majority decides to stick with Core's SegWit first plan (which would be fine -- that's how Bitcoin works), any delay or hiccup could make people re-consider, and Classic will be right there (for as long as the devs maintain it -- the longer, the better, I say). Classic isn't XT.
Edit: Almost forgot, Bitcoin Original.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:31:03
There is one way: listen to what the miners intend to do (for argument's sake, 2M blocks on and from date X), coordinate and bump Core's limit on that date. Boom, emergent consensus reached on date X, but without adopting BU and handing power to the miners _permanently_. If the miners later want blocks that are clearly too big, then is the time to take a stand.
Adopting BU is a no go though.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:18:24
There are miners all over the world. You want to fire all of them (correct me if I'm wrong) purely because SegWit has not activated.

@_date: 2016-03-01 12:55:55
Good Lord no. You are advocating hobbling Bitcoin purely for the purposes of driving fees higher. That is a decision for the miners to make, and they ultimately listen to users.
If miners feel they aren't being compensated correctly, they can demand more fees. This has, in fact, been happening (i.e. well before full blocks). Zero or very low fee TXs get zero or very low priority. That is a fee market, and it operates perfectly well without a production quota.
What you seem to want is a human set of economic policy makers who actually have nothing to do with making or processing transactions.
@_date: 2016-01-27 15:58:11
Just to expand on that:
- Miners' profits will go down accordingly.
- Some miners may become unprofitable.
- Hashrate will likely flatten, or may even dip slightly, as unprofitable miners leave the network.
- Profitable miners will continue to mine and upgrades to more power efficient ASICs will probably offset miners leaving and eventually lead to the hashrate rising once again.
- Miners will be selling fewer bitcoins (some may be forced to sell reserves over the short term, but the trend will be less newly mined coins for sale).
- Downward price pressure could reduce, nudging the bitcoin price higher.
Though no one really knows for sure. An alternative scenario might be:
- Miners scramble to sell coins (reserves and newly mined) to pay their bills.
- TX volume increases massively on price movements.
- Bitcoin's 1MB limit and a barely implemented SegWit fails to cope with ever expanding mempools, nodes start crashing because they run out of RAM and everyone gets really pissed off with stuck transactions and wildly unpredictable fee requirements that change block by block.
- People divest and the recent trend of BTC market cap falling vs other alts continues.
- More Ethereum spam in the bitcoin-related reddits.

Seems to me his stance is: altclients can only ever create invalid chains, albeit potentially much longer and better supported i.e. by greater hashrate than Core, in which event Core will still be considered Bitcoin in r/bitcoin until the only visitors here are people completely new to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:15:03


Huh? 51% of what? Hash rate? Do you mean that by _not running specific software_ the ~75% of hash rate not signalling SegWit support is _attacking_ Bitcoin?

@_date: 2016-03-02 18:18:20
What is the better option for getting his TX confirmed?
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:15:18
Agree about addressing as a contingency but it is a nuclear option. Bitcoin without its uniquely high hash rate is worth very considerably less. Less than many altcoins I dare say (which are now reasonably well established in terms of their own hash rate). Exercise the nuclear option over such a silly thing as a conservative increase in the block size? That would be insane. Now query how much of the economic majority would, when push comes to shove, consider it sane. (I don't support BU FYI, just pointing out that there are the dynamics at play.)
There is another issue. As ASIC owners, the current set of miners are more financially committed to Bitcoin and its progress/success than any other miner of any other crypto (since their ASICs are otherwise useless). And yet the suggestion is that the current incentive scheme has failed (i.e. the 70%+ of miners not signalling SegWit are now "hostile" and we the Bitcoin community is under attack -- Luke-Jr's words). If the incentive scheme really has failed so spectacularly, what reason to think it will work for new, significantly less invested miners (hint: there is none)? So a mere PoW change might not be enough.
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:58:07
This only works (a) if the econ majority support it* and (b) if there are enough TXs to grow the blocks to enormous sizes.
*Part of the reason I don't support BU is that the default AD setting is too low. Moot point but if the default AD was substantially higher, would you feel different? What if exchanges were to advertise their EB and AD settings to (try to) enforce only very conservative growth? Just thinking out aloud here.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:47:38
You do realise BitFury is a Core supporter, right? The threat of litigation is very silly but put yourself in the position of BitFury, a very heavily invested mining and other Bitcoin things operation. From their perspective they see Core supporters chomping at the bit to kill **all** Bitcoin mining companies - including any that would support a minority hash rate chain - just because a few miners/pools are calling for a hard fork block size increase (which would be highly unlikely without substantial user support, which BU doesn't have!). I can see why BitFury is more than a little concerned.
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:16:18
I'm with you; BU will (or should) fail, if the plan is for the entire community to accept miner control of the protocol. Nodes decide the valid chain. Unfortunately, a bump in the max block size is not necessarily a true test of community appetite for miner control.

It's fine to disagree on this particular point -- but I think you're nuts. If it became obvious the market was moving to 2M, the Core project would too. Not doing so would confirm everyone's worst suspicions (and the project would become irrelevant). I would have zero sympathy for any ragequitting Bitcoin dev (that includes the first, Mike Hearn). 
@_date: 2016-03-06 12:24:25
Yes, I understand that. I'm merely pointing out that this situation is unusual. The status quo changes the economics of Bitcoin. Given that the people who don't want to increase the block size now _do want to lift it later_, they are clearly engaging in central planning.
You're right, it's very, very unfortunate the 1M limit is in place. Bitcoin's ability to resist change is, in the minds of many, being used (unwittingly) against it.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:19:51

@_date: 2016-03-08 07:21:17
A spammer could RBF too. If blocks are full with TXs that people are desperate to include, the attack will be very cheap, it will fuck with wallet fee estimates and some people will always miss out. That was my only point. It's made worse by miner agreements. BTCC openly prioritises its own customers' TXs, even zero fee. How long before other miners do the same, in a full block environment? More people missing out despite paying ever higher fees. RBF isn't the answer.
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:20:56
It's also a nuclear option in the sense that users would be _nuking themselves_, destroying one of Bitcoin's critically important and crypto differentiating features: it's uniquely high hash rate (read: security). To prevent against genuine 51% attacks such as double spends or changes to the inflation schedule, sure, nuke away. To prevent a conservative block size increase or force SegWit? Not convinced.

True, but the required fee can change quite dramatically. Which can mean the fee determined by your wallet or online service is suddenly not enough, and there's nothing you can do. It doesn't happen all that often, but it does happen. BitGo's CEO was complaining about this only yesterday.

Far from it, but in hindsight - and with SegWit now in play - it makes a lot of sense.
@_date: 2016-01-19 11:02:44


This is far from clear. SegWit is a huge update. Think about all the wallets and other infrastructure out there that won't be ready in time. That leaves a real risk of acute block space scarcity and fee pressure -- and we just don't know how those changes in economics will impact Bitcoin and its users. Q: why even risk that scenario at this early stage in Bitcoin's life? If it can easily be avoided by bumping to 2MB, then by SegWit, IBLT, weak blocks, etc, systems like LN and side chains might actually be in place to deal with long term growth. It worries me when people like Pieter Wuille say we should let a fee market develop sooner than later, because it makes me think that's the motive for going SegWit first (as good as SegWit is).

There is: the prospect of wrecked Bitcoin value, which directly punishes the 51%! Not sure why people think Bitcoin's properly aligned incentives have failed or are about to fail?
PoW change is a nuclear option to ensure destruction of miners' investments (but, of course, it comes with all the ill effects of exercising a nuclear option).
@_date: 2016-01-10 23:55:18
I get that, but miners have been pretty clear; no one is mining XT/101 blocks. The survey of major miners/pools suggested yes to increase, but no to 8MB (notwithstanding they could soft limit to way less). A new implementation with, say, 2-4-8 or similar, would do much better IMO.
@_date: 2016-01-12 11:03:00
It's attempted coercion. Ugly in the extreme.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:48:16
Exactly. For users it's a simple question: (if the change in question is palatable) upgrade software to follow the hash rate and keep Bitcoin's unique feature i.e. its uniquely high hash rate **or** (if the change in question is not palatable) take a stand and reject the change (and blocks mined by the hash rate pushing the change) and, if necessary, change the PoW algorithm.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:35:23
Or you can acknowledge that SegWit is not _uncontroversial_ (it's not just Roger and Jihan that oppose it -- and they don't even control the 70% of hash rate not signalling SegWit). You can blame "the miners" but ultimately they are not obliged to run specific software immediately or at all. They always wanted a simple block size increase and we should have can-kicked a year or more ago IMO. I partly blame Core devs (including Gavin A and Mike H at the time) for not reaching agreement way back then, and others for demonising hard forks ever since. I wish miners would get on with activating SegWit but I can't blame them for exercising extreme caution over SegWit and the changes it introduces and wanting/supporting other options from Core/other devs.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:26:47
Whilst I agree, blocks that size are an awfully long way off and if Bitcoin really does advance to the level of gold or a global reserve currency - something everyone is hoping for - it's not inconceivable that it would be impossible for any government to shut Bitcoin down at that point, even if block sizes necessitate datacenter type connectivity. Corps and govs will be using Bitcoin; it won't be 5 nodes in 2 datacenters, it will be hundreds or thousands of nodes globally, in datacenters in virtually every country (each corp and gov and non-profit etc protecting its own vested interests). It's decentralisation, but on a different level. (Or at least that's how the argument goes. Not saying I agree. At this stage, I think it has to be two different coins, one small, run at home, the other big.)
@_date: 2017-03-19 05:41:29
I agree and I suspect Brian A does too. That doesn't mean CB should sign a statement saying "Core forever even if overwhelming support swings the other way". And FWIW, I don't think any of the other exchanges will maintain that position either (in the unlikely even overwhelming support swings to BU or some other fork).
@_date: 2017-03-20 05:54:34
If you truly believe 80%+ of the hash rate is going to hard fork without overwhelming user/business/exchange support (which BU does not currently have), then you necessarily believe miners won't care about a PoW change. All the PoW change talk is doing is sticking it to the miners who actually support Core and SegWit.
@_date: 2016-01-12 10:52:13
Don't forget the halving this year. It could impact TX volume enormously.
@_date: 2017-03-23 06:42:51
You're talking about many, many years into the future, and making various assumptions about TX volume growth, lack of fraud proofs solution and so on. I think it's too early to draw a line in that regard. Heck, SegWit is 4M, so Core acknowledges it's premature too.
An equivalent argument on the other side would be: if only banks, corporates and governments can afford the extraordinarily high main chain fees of a 1M future, they can make Bitcoin into whatever they want.

_Not_ increasing the limit is hugely controversial. Until now, miners had simply been lifting their soft limits. The hard limit was never expected or intended to act as a production quota. Certainly not 1M anyway. It completely changes the economics of Bitcoin. That's happening right now.
Sure, you can say, "it's just a few cents more", or "miners will will become dependent on fees eventually", but this new economic policy has very clearly been disruptive, at a time when investment in other blockchains is outpacing investment in Bitcoin and - crucially - we're barely a few days in.
Bitcoin will continue to improve, sure, but why are we messing with Bitcoin economics now, when none of the plan B options are ready? Seems like the most risky option to me.

In 3-6 months? Wow, that's optimistic!


I doubt it. Satoshi was a "big blocker" after all, and his vision (which is what many of us signed up for) was P2P e-cash used by millions, not a high cost settlement system used by a few. If it seems like "the big blocker side" is losing support, it's not; rather it has become obvious that SegWit first will now happen -- the miners and pool operators (specifically, the 3-4 people party to _that_ backroom deal that represent the vast majority of the hashrate) decided as much. It stinks, but it is what it is.


If this turns out to be the case, it will be because SegWit (and the subsequent hard fork?) were enough in the short to medium term. But query where we would be today if the SegWit SF hadn't been "invented". I suspect, rightly or wrongly, Core would still be dragging its feet. Gavin and Mike forced the issue, in my mind, and things got done because of that.
I agree, I think we will see SegWit code released and implemented. The miners have decided as much. Hopefully Core will come together when Adam, Luke and Peter reveal the promised hard fork BIP -- wishful thinking, perhaps, but some form of flex cap to (hopefully) prevent future arguments would be best.
r/btc will be here for years to come. The bizarre mod policy in r/bitcoin has ensured that. Personally, I visit both -- important because both are way too one-sided.
@_date: 2017-03-29 07:09:12
Users have to choose to fire miners first - and give up that uniquely high hash rate - all for not running new software.
@_date: 2016-01-18 22:39:20
Exactly -- everyone supports SegWit.
The only question now is whether we 2MB hard fork _before_ SegWit.
(Odd that Blockstream isn't yet on the list.)
@_date: 2016-01-11 14:56:16
The issue is anyone who doesn't upgrade (unless they modify Core, they won't necessarily know to upgrade) won't be verifying a large proportion of TXs post soft fork. That's a pretty ugly scenario. 
The alternative is hard fork now. What better time, when virtually everyone is focussed on the possibility? There were two scaling conferences FFS, with 90% of the hashrate supposedly represented on stage.
Perhaps more importantly, alert messages would be sent out in the event of a hard fork, greatly emphasising the seriousness of the situation and telling people to upgrade.
The funny thing (not funny, but you know what I mean) is _everyone_ fully expects a hard fork to become necessary soon (Core's roadmap alludes to increasing the block size later, perhaps by 2-4-8 or some flexcap scheme). It will not be any easier later on. Which makes me think the more practise, the better. We have, as far as I know, only had one proper, scheduled hard fork... it was successful and it took a mere 24 hours.

@_date: 2016-03-02 16:16:08
And you're confident that will be true tomorrow, in one week, in one month?
If we permanently restrict on-chain growth by keeping the block size limit, fees will continue to rise. If the long term goal of _some people_ is met - Bitcoin as a settlement layer, primarily used by banks, businesses and other hubs - those fees could be $20 or more. Yay?
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:29:27
Core should say that somewhere, rather than recommending an insufficient fee by "default" (if that's what happened).
@_date: 2016-03-15 21:07:02
You've lost me -- no one is providing more toilet paper (yet).
Are you referring to the cost to full node owners of storing so-called "spam" transactions? Whilst I recognise the costs associated with that, that is what full node owners sign up for ie to store the entire ledger and not discriminate between fee-paying transactions and not be compensated for any of it. Ideally spam attacks would be too expensive to run for any length of time. With full blocks or near full blocks or if they make use of BTCC's BlockPriority, they are not.
@_date: 2016-03-05 23:24:16

@_date: 2017-03-20 15:54:54
You probably need to stop blaming only Bitmain and accept that the majority of hash rate (seemingly) supports larger blocks but not the SegWit soft fork. Forking because Core and its supporters are not getting their way is unacceptable (not least because Core's  reason for not bumping the block size limit is avoiding a hard fork).
I don't support BU, I do favour SegWit first (purely on the basis it's ready), I absolutely do not support a change of PoW just to push SegWit through and/or avoid a can-kick block size increase. I'd be surprised to see the economic majority choose the nuclear option.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:58:51
It all comes down to timing.
Some people think SegWit, even if pushed out quickly, won't increase TX capacity sufficiently in time to prevent block space scarcity/TX fee pressure. It certainly won't increase capacity in April for the entire network. The halving in July could amplify the issue (with an uptick in TXs). There's lots of infrastructure updating to do before the capacity benefits of SegWit are realised. Hence some people think removing any doubts over block space scarcity/fee pressure _is_ the technical justification for a hard fork.
(Agree that SegWit is generally awesome and a necessary update, as does everyone, I think. The only question marks are around timing and implementation.)
After a few years of mulling over options, more talking, XT's eventual release (which somewhat forced the issue), and two big scaling conferences... there is seemingly still no guaranteed-to-remove-any-doubts-over-block-space-scarcity/fee-pressure solution _other than a hard fork_. At least in some people's minds.

Produces 70% of _new_ hardware, maybe, currently, but Bitmain _controlling_ 70% of the current hash rate? I haven't heard anyone seriously suggest that. Heck, BU would be way further ahead if that were true (Core has the largest share of hash rate right now).
The statement from GBMiners is interesting and potentially worrying; I'm just surprised, given the tenacity of the more militant Core supporters, there hasn't been something more concrete than this anecdotal evidence.

@_date: 2016-01-20 17:24:42


Even a contentious hard fork (where Core digs its heels in until Classic gains &gt;75% hashrate) isn't _all or nothing_. Core can quickly accept the will of the market, bump to 2MB and carry on coding. It could all happen in the run up to 75% or within the grace period or afterwards. I suspect a lot of people / businesses / miners would switch back (if not immediately, certainly at the very first signs of any Classic misstep -- not incorporating a change or incorporating it too slowly or incorporating something no one wants, whatever).
Obviously if Core devs ragequit or try and fight it out with 1MB, then is the time to be angry.

The scaling benefits might not be felt for quite some time. Certainly not in time for the halving, which I think people are nervous about.
There's zero doubt with a hard fork.
Given all the discussions over _which hard fork to proceed with_ through 2015, why the huge fear now of hard forks?
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:24:02
Sure, you can _coerce_ miners into running specific software - or try to - but that's different. That's the UASF chain split idea, right?
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:40:31
So? Anyone can push any code they like, but changing the protocol rules still requires users _accepting the changes by running the software_. If BU has no user support, they likely won't fork (or if they do, they split the chain and go their own way). Changing the inflation schedule is a wildly different proposition to a conservative block size increase. A majority of users might well follow the hash rate in the event they announce a move to slightly larger blocks at a certain date, but highly unlikely to support a change to the inflation schedule. IMO.
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:19:41
You seem to be suggesting that any TXs that are outbid (or guess the wrong fee -- which becomes increasingly likely as all fee guessing algorithms improve) are spam.
@_date: 2016-01-19 11:35:07
Completely agree that SegWit is necessary -- for the malleability fix, version bits, etc. I fully expect it to be implemented in every other implementation.
The scaling benefit is icing on the cake, but the question, however, is: will SegWit be implemented _and in use by everyone_ quickly enough to address the potential issue of block space scarcity and resulting fee pressure? It's impossible to answer that question definitively, which is why some people think the less risky option is to bump the block size limit first. But you know that -- the arguments are now well known. Core devs have laid their cards on the table and now it comes down to user / miner / economic majority vote.
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:41:51
Not sure 75%+ of miners would go for it though, which Classic's "contentious" hard fork would likely require.

Bigger block advocates have been arguing for a can-kick increase for years. Being short sighted is not the issue in this context -- it's a can-kick after all! The slippery slope argument - that it would be _can-kick after can-kick_ - is FUD (and I suspect with hindsight small block advocates would much rather have faced that prospect than BU!).


Block propagation is not an issue in this context (SegWit bump vs HF bump, which was the only point of my original comment). In any event, you are assessing the network's ability _now_ to handle vastly more TXs and bigger blocks, which is nonsensical. Most big block advocates fully support second layer solutions too, when they become viable -- and assuming they're actually competitive.


I'm not arguing against SegWit, my point was simply that value delivered to _users_ (necessarily measured in raw capacity increase) is better with a simplistic block size change.

@_date: 2017-03-19 05:48:40
The slippery slope argument is stupid. Tech progresses (storage, bandwidth) and software improves, so the block size should increase at least in line with expectations. And SegWit is a block size increase (and less efficient in raw capacity terms than a simple increase!), so by your measure Core is promoting further centralisation. (Or did I miss your sarcasm?)
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:08:32
Save that TX volume simply can not grow. It is maxed out. There are no more on-chain TXs today than there were 6 months ago. So Bitcoin's network effect is necessarily limited and will be until the block size issue is resolved. There's no way around that. I think we're already starting to see fees peak and users head elsewhere.

To be fair, according to Samson Mow, filling blocks (an "attack") to make Bitcoin "unreliable" (there's no way around it: no capacity means increased uncertainty about whether your TX will confirm when you expect it to confirm) costs "a few hundred bucks" (The Bitcoin Game podcast ep 35).
So Gavin is spot on. (Note: Gavin does not say Bitcoin is dying/dead/can be killed -- he is merely pointing out very obvious problems with the current state of Bitcoin. Though I do wonder what someone _who really wanted to hurt Bitcoin_ could do with, say, $1m.)

This is no different to devs suggesting a best course of action for miners.

Disagree. A change to PoW will not create a coin with "comparable security" to Bitcoin now. It will likely be substantially less secure, at least short term, than some other alts.
For argument's sake, suppose the hash rate insists on a HF to 2M; I believe enough users will accept the change (some happily, some reluctantly) such that 2MCoin retains (or, if you like, gains) very significant value. Sure, the most stubborn might cry "slippery slope" and insist on sticking with the 1MCoin alt following a PoW change, but it's wishful thinking in the extreme that it will have "comparably secure". I expect there are enough CPU/GPU miners and botnets out there that would love to give Bitcoin (or 1MCoin) a tough time.
@_date: 2016-03-04 12:29:33


Interesting. I wonder why he gave up? Surely the "massive banking cartel" still wants Bitcoin delivered to it "on a silver platter". Maybe they found a better way of achieving that. Making Bitcoin a high cost settlement layer sounds like one way, if we're going to dive into ridiculous conspiracy theories. Just keep the blocks small, let the peasants use LN, keep the main chain for the cartel.


Here you go: 


They don't need to "force change". The change happens automatically by _not addressing the issue_ -- and _not addressing the issue_ is precisely what they have done for over a year. We still have the same hard limit which has now transformed into a production quota, stopping miners from adjusting their soft limits and pushing fee-paying transactions and users away.
If you think everything is hunky-dory, that's fine, we can continue to disagree.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:24:07
Bitcoin has a uniquely high hash rate. It is the most secure, censor resistant digital asset on the planet. If you really think throwing away that unique feature over a 2 or 4M upgrade is worthwhile, good luck to you. Personally, I think BTU, with 100% of Bitcoin's current hash rate (after your PoW change), will be very valuable in its own right. (So much so, people will probably call it Bitcoin.) If this was something more untoward, like a mining majority double spending, or even trying to force 100M blocks, I might think different. I won't run BU but I might follow the hash rate on this one.
@_date: 2016-01-12 18:26:17
Bumping up the block size limit will not be deciding factor when it comes to de/centralisation.
Tech changes quickly -- there's no reason Bitcoin should stay put. Be conservative and lag if need be, that's fine, but to stall completely is nonsensical. 5G mobile, a few short years away, is in the multiple Gbps (real world tests). Who knows where cable, other landlands and satellite will be by then. I'm on 100Mbps down and 15Mbps up, and it's not the top package available to me. I think we'll find developing countries leapfrog old tech and go straight to reasonably quick Internet too.
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:55:56


And the economic change (and the combination of all three) ie SegWit TXs being cheaper, creating two classes of users.


Sorry, I meant "voting" in the loosest sense; the current situation (consensus seemingly forming around 2MB hard fork) really boils down to users and Bitcoin businesses expressing their wishes (by supporting an alternative client) and miners expressing their wishes (pledging hashrate).

It's disingenuous because if someone sees "you don't need to upgrade your software, your node will validate all the rules they did before", they might not think that means "if you don't upgrade, your node will consider all SegWit TXs (which we hope will be all TXs) as anyone-can-spend ie they won't be validating them at all".

He actually came across as very down to earth, unassuming and honest -- at least to me, at the time (I was there). Hearn I liked less (easy to say that now!).
What's interesting to me, though, is that he (Gavin) absolutely succeeded with XT. (Hearn seems to think Bitcoin is lost, so maybe his motivations for XT were different.) I haven't watched the video but when talking about the lack of progress on increasing the block size, Gavin mentioned the need to "bash some heads" to get things moving. That's exactly what XT did; scaling and block size have been the focus of the entire community since, we've had two scaling conferences and now we face the likelihood of a 2MB HF. (Andreas A described it brilliantly in the latest LTB podcast -- releasing XT was like placing a loaded gun on the mantelpiece; the fact of it being there and the threat of someone using it forced people to talk.) I could be wrong, but I think that was the motivation for Gavin -- not a power grab, as some have suggested.

Not bitching about the fees; speculating that the perception of stagnation and negative market sentiment could lead to another long, slow price decline. Resolution in the block size debate would counter that.
Incidentally, not that I can buy lunch with Bitcoin anywhere around here, yes, $0.50 fees would stop me using Bitcoin to buy lunch. I'd just use my credit card and pick up a few reward points instead. Perhaps more to your point, large (kb) transactions can cost dollars or even tens of dollars to process. Just FYI.

The unfortunate truth is that "ChinaBU" and Ver do not control 70%+ of the global hash rate. Miners just aren't signalling for SegWit. Yet.
@_date: 2017-03-19 05:58:53
IMO it's meaningless to commit now to something that is still very much unpredictable. If BU amasses lots of hash rate and that hash rate feels like it has the support of lots of users and it essentially puts out a flag day saying eg "2M next month, prep your nodes", I think a lot of users will opt to follow rather than take the nuclear option of PoW change or fighting for survival with a tiny % of the hash rate. If that happens, and Core becomes non-viable (maybe a PoW change becomes necessary or a HF to adjust difficulty), it's not inconceivable that most of the value will go to the working chain with the uniquely high hash rate, in which case _all_ major exchanges will call it Bitcoin.
However unlikely, I'd rather an exchange take a thoughtful, considered approach than signing a letter that _suggests_ something else. Just IMO.
I run (and use!) a Core full node btw, I don't support BU. And if the above scenario occurred I'd update that with an appropriate block size limit, not hand the reigns over by moving to an emergent consensus implementation.

Struggling to see a scenario where I might rush to make further purchases, presumably not already contemplated, all within a 10 minute window.
Pay-as-you-go is an extremely narrow use case, not least because RBF proponents also tend to be small block proponents, meaning it would have to be a relatively expensive pay-as-you-go service (also query what the user experience would be -- how would the software on both sides cope with that first confirmation?). All seems far fetched.

@_date: 2017-03-22 21:48:00
No. There is a lot of blustering and posturing around an argument about block size (and more fundamentally the issue of whether blocks should _always_ be full).
Even if a supermajority of hash rate determines to produce bigger blocks on and from date X, it's not entirely clear the Bitcoin community won't go along with the plan (cf altering the inflation schedule, which users would absolutely not accept). That said, I do not believe the miners will initiate a fork without very substantial community support (which they do not have -- heck they don't even have a majority of the hash rate yet!).
Let's wind back the rhetoric.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:43:23

He doesn't control the 70% of hash rate _not_ signalling SegWit. I've also yet to see any evidence that he won't sell hardware to people running Core compatible software (you'd think this would be easy enough to show).
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:16:02
Who cares about economically irrelevant non-consenting full nodes (surely not you)? Even if they are important, this assumes that having been aware of the incoming upgrade, they take the nuclear option of firing the miners and opting for a chain with zero or near zero hash rate. Good luck to those nodes, I suppose.
If the fork was about something more serious --changing the inflation schedule, for example -- then the nuclear option makes more sense (and you'd expect the economically relevant nodes to act accordingly), but the only argument against a can-kick block size bump (ignoring SegWit for a second) seems to be "slippery slope", which is BS.
Meanwhile UASF takes a guess at whether the economic majority support it and causes a split in the network if enough of the hash rate and some users and exchanges ignore it (which, given the split in the community, seems more likely than not, no?).

Bitcoin is not what the owner of the sub r/bitcoin says it is.
If the major miners and pool operators in China say it is X (assuming &gt;75% of total hashrate), and users/the econ majority do not oppose it, then it is X. That is not controversial, since the miners won't make a move without knowing they have the support of the users/econ majority in any event.

Irrelevant. They might have sent those TXs hoping they'd get in but now they are stuck because they never achieve the right fee. Query how there is a backlog of 1GB of transactions "below the fee line" -- if blocks aren't full, why are they not getting in?
@_date: 2017-03-20 05:57:52
No one has 51% attacked anything and I've yet to see miners say they will hard fork without substantial user/business/exchange support. The centralisation in mining isn't permanent or even that bad right now (if it was we wouldn't be having this chat and Core wouldn't still have a majority of hash rate). Miners are fickle and can quickly switch pools, ASIC production is (currently) more centralised but there's nothing stopping new entrants to the market, ASIC tech is sufficiently advanced that the advantage of incumbents isn't what it used to be and there's zero proof chip sales are being used to attack the network. There is a lot of FUD, however.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:08:03
The SW discount means attackers can spam larger blocks -- 1M+SegWit (the current SW plan) means up to 4M spam blocks, 2M+SegWit means up to 8M spam blocks, 4M means 16M spam blocks, etc. That's partly why bigger block supporters think a block size increase post SegWit is _even less likely_ (unless the discount disappears, but that seems unlikely).

Bitcoin companies that bridge the gap between fiat and Bitcoin are **absolutely essential** to the Bitcoin ecosystem. They literally help power Bitcoin's network effects.
Crucially, it's all **opt-in**. Feel free to ignore Coinbase completely if you like, but "regressing the cause"? _Sigh_ (to whoever says that).

Could be a combination of things, but this is all guesswork on my part -- time taken for your payment to clear, Bitcoin network congestion (though this has only been a thing for a day or two, and in any event their internal transfers are almost certainly off-chain), Coinbase running ID checks, etc. Unlikely to be liquidity issues.
I use Coinbase for instant purchases using a credit card and there has never been a delay.

@_date: 2017-03-23 06:37:22
Not saying BU will be accepted. I'm just acknowledging two possible scenarios:
(1) Supermajority of hash rate coordinates and says, "2M blocks on date X or get left behind". At that point, I want a Core patch to 2M. Personally I am not willing to fire the miners for such an innocuous change (others may disagree, of course).
(2) Supermajority surprises everyone by suddenly mining larger blocks, leaving most of the community (and my node) behind. I'd be much less happy about this, but I'd still see considerable value in a chain with such an  extraordinarily high hash rate. Again, if I were to accept the change, it would be with a patched Core node, **not** by adopting BU or any emergent consensus software that hands more control to miners. In other words, I'd (reluctantly) consider it a can-kick and assess the next can-kick if and when the time comes. If the miners were this aggressive, I'd probably support a PoW change on the original chain (but probably not sell on either chain).
I don't necessarily see either of these scenarios playing out btw; I doubt the miners will initiate anything without significant user support (which they don't seem to have). I'd much rather they get on with activating SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:43:58

Sure, but I'm not going to pay someone to check the Airbitz wallet code (my preferred wallet), nor the Mycelium code, nor any other code. I have no idea what those updates do. I just download them. So I do, in fact, trust that those wallet devs are honest, or the open source code (if applicable) is adequately reviewed, and that they adequately protect their code submission keys and whatnot. There's always trust somewhere, unless you write your own code or review code or pay someone to review code (heck, even then you're trusting them to do a good job and not lie).
I'm not recommending Coinbase for storing coins, by the way. Great exchange though, for my purposes, which I use reasonably regularly.

@_date: 2016-01-06 12:39:46
No one is talking about an immediate substantial increase. Even XT/101 _gradually_ lifts the limit, and even then miners can (as they always have) run with a soft limit. Sufficient decentralised resources and incentives exist for &gt;1MB. I'm not an XT/101 proponent, but keeping 1MB in the hope SegWit is sufficiently widely _implemented_ in time to avoid a fee event seems unnecessary and arguably the more risky option.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:37:35
Just to be clear, I'm anti BU and pro SegWit. Re the above, I honestly think "rescaling" means respecting the max SegWit block size (i.e. the attack vector SegWit creates). A bump in the non-witness size to 4M means max SegWit block size of 16M, so even 4M is highly unlikely any time soon.
Also, you say "at least 8x today's transaction capacity" (which is generous!) is "still more than [8M]", which is obviously incorrect; it's the same.

@_date: 2016-01-10 13:11:13
No, they just underestimated how conservative certain interested parties would be and overestimated their own ability to "bash some heads and get things done", which I think was the intention. They probably didn't imagine the type and extent of censorship we have seen here and elsewhere either.
SegWit feels like a bit of an excuse for delaying the hard fork to be honest (a hard fork being inevitable, of course, and no easier later), but it's certainly a welcome development in and of itself. I just wonder about the combination of block scarcity / fee pressure and the halving in 5 months' time -- worst case could be ugly.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:27:31
Same with a hard fork.
@_date: 2016-03-01 22:15:32


How do you explain the phenomenon of zero fee TXs or very low fee TXs not being processed, or being very seriously delayed, _before_ full blocks became a thing (i.e. when there was plenty of block space)? Miners were setting their own rules.
In any case, soft limits would surely be preferable. Allow the miners to react much more quickly. That is what we have been doing to date.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:28:24
Nonsense-- quite apart from anything, it _requires_ users (not just miners) to run BU. BU miners will not fork unless and until they think the economic majority will follow. If everyone else is running Core and signalling 1M, there will be no fork. I don't support BU for various reasons, most caught in the OP, but it's silly to suggest Jihan or anyone else is going to take a chance on creating larger blocks when the majority of nodes will reject them.

Whilst true, it does seem that a decision has been made to pursue paths other than those alluded to by Satoshi (fraud proofs, for example) which might have provided for better on-chain scaling (not suggesting that L2 isn't also important). The most influential Core devs want small blocks for reasons other than decentralisation and fear of hard forks ( Let's at least acknowledge that.

This from the guy who was convinced by Blockstream's Adam Back (not Core devs) to follow Core, and then promptly signed a commitment letter to _not run anyone else's code_ (could that move be any less Bitcoin?).


Strangely, he didn't care about this when he was arguing in favour of 8M blocks last year. He also ignores that SegWit requires 2M+ and allows an attacker to push 4M "blocks".
The fact he had a three-hour call with Adam Back "about Core" speak volumes.


Which are made considerably worse by the slightly hacky SegWit and the "adversarial conditions" he mentions. Yet he's perfectly willing to accept that trade-off?
/rant :)
I really hope someone comes up with an acceptable flexcap idea for the promised HF...
@_date: 2016-03-03 15:33:37
Exactly. And no-one thinks block size increases alone are the answer. Everyone recognises that block size is one _tool_ in the scaling toolbox. (Heck even Core do, they just seem to be _really unwilling to use it_.)
@_date: 2016-03-02 11:46:28


OB will be rendered useless if people don't want to use bitcoins for commerce.
The Bitcoin user base is still very, very small (i.e. number of people likely to buy and sell things using bitcoins). OB is no doubt worried about the short to medium term implications of Core's roadmap (which risks discouraging new Bitcoin users with potentially unreliable TXs and/or increasing fees -- rightly or wrongly, that's where we are today, a scenario that was seemingly predictable and avoidable).
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:00:51
Not to old nodes. They see 1M (and sure, maybe the SegWit TXs therein are smaller, but the blocks are not bigger).
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:17:34
In pure capacity terms, SegWit in its current form seems somewhat _inefficient_; a 4M can-kick would offer more capacity than SegWit+Schnoor+MAST, etc. LN can work with or without SegWit. SegWit also makes post-SegWit block size increases _more difficult_ (assuming the SegWit discount is kept; in that case an increase to 4M would open the doors to 16M spam blocks).
All that said, I support SegWit now (assuming miners get onboard) on the basis that it's ready, it has wide support and because a lot of interesting dev work is being done on projects that assume SegWit.
@_date: 2016-01-12 22:20:17
Control has become a side issue following the years of inertia and the SegWit switcheroo, but there's still an enormous difference between Classic and the status quo -- to pretend otherwise is completely disingenuous.
There are plenty of people (guess we're about to find out who) that simply want an increase the block size limit -- any increase -- _to remove doubt about possible short term block space scarcity and fee pressure_.  If it's a conservative 2-4-8 over the next few years, so be it. Rather that than a SegWit Hail Mary (not dismissing SegWit, but I don't buy that it's an obvious fix to the possibility of block space scarcity and fee pressure issues short term).

Prep a PoW change for an attack scenario but a disagreement over an initial scaling step? Seems OTT, and the threats do nothing to help (same can be said for the other side, of course). I'm somewhat torn; I don't want to hand control to miners via BU but I would follow a conservative can-kick hard fork (by increasing the limit on my Core full node). If miners try again to ramp up the limit, I'll reconsider my position at the time.
@_date: 2017-03-12 05:44:39
This presupposes that users won't want the BU coins. BU (which I do not support) is no different to Core in one key respect: the miners won't fork unless and until they are sure they have the support of users! That support will be reflected by users running node software supporting &gt;1M (currently not happening). I haven't seen anyone on the BU side suggest they will fork with only a majority of hash rate, which makes this whole discussion pretty pointless.
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:02:02
Ah, so having forked away and running for x period of time,  BU nodes should accept a huge re-org and the undoing of post fork TXs because hash rate has moved to the original branch? That seems unreasonable, and unrelated to _emergent consensus on block size_, but whatever, BU is wrong for other reasons.
@_date: 2016-06-19 10:25:03


You seem to be confused. The only zero and low fee paying transactions included in blocks are those being included *by miners and mining pools*. Take, for example, BTCC's BlockPriority. BTCC prioritises its own clients' transactions - even zero and low fee paying transactions - in all the blocks it mines.
With limited block space, it is only a matter of time before all big miners and mining pools effectively pre-sell space or have other similar arrangements. Gavin A already commented on this in one of his blog posts. It makes it all the more difficult for fee guessing algos, but it is what it is.
@_date: 2016-06-02 12:21:35
Heals are dug in and for so long as the miners stick with Core, Core need not worry about having to back down.
Fortunately, the reference software has been tweaked over previous iterations to avoid some of the full block/ever expanding mempool problems, so Bitcoin should remain stable, at least. No one really knows, however, what damage has been done / is being done by retaining the 1MB bottleneck. If nothing else, it has split the community and new investment in cryptocurrency is largely heading in other directions (and only a matter of time before they develop their own network effects).
@_date: 2016-06-30 19:43:06
I don't think anyone thinks otherwise. That doesn't mean blockchains can't scale _to some degree_. 
I think everyone is cautiously optimistic about LN.
@_date: 2016-06-28 10:31:52


Until recently, miners were in control of the block size. Soft limits. Modest increases do not mean centralisation. If they did, SegWit would not be an option either. TX volume growth has been increasing at a consistent rate for years. Price closely follows TX volume growth over time. Now is the first time in Bitcoin's history that the network will not be able to grow at the same rate. SegWit is great for a number of reasons, but as a capacity can kick it's very little, very late*.
* That's not to say I disagree with SegWit first. We are where we are and it is what it is.
@_date: 2016-06-24 20:46:31
Miner decentralisation pretty key long term. Hashrate doesn't mean much if 3-4 guys can make decisions for 90% of the hashrate (I know independent miners can, in theory, leave the giant pools, but in practice they don't -- similarly, I know users can threaten the nuke option of changing the PoW algo, but in that case security starts again from zero).
@_date: 2016-06-27 16:14:30
Read the article. It clearly asks for those involved to make a statement -- not the entire Core team. The agreement was for 2M non-witness data, so your SegWit=2M makes even less sense.

No one knows for sure.
In theory, however, a market supporting a certain price now, when faced with reduced supply, will pay more (ie price will go up). Long term this is most likely in my mind.
On the flip side, miners may not have been selling all their coins each week. The reduced reward might mean they sell more of their coins to compensate. Meaning, perversely, increased supply and lower price.
Then there are the speculators, like you. Many might be waiting for a halving boost before selling. Or they might have thought the halving was priced in already.
It will also be interesting to see how Bitcoin copes with the inevitable big uptick in trading/transactions, given that blocks are full. Will a horrible UX cause alarm?
I would have said miners turning off equipment might have been a worry too, but the recent price rise has fixed that.

The block size has been an issue - debated - for YEARS. Classic was not a "coin"; it was an alternative Bitcoin implementation published so that Bitcoin's users and miners could properly express their perfectly valid preference for larger blocks.

Bitcoin without its uniquely high hash rate isn't much better.

Something has to give eventually.

Assuming the guy is right (i.e. that the Core client recommended a far-too-low fee), then the Core client should be fixed to address this. At the very least, there should be a warning about the need to check the fee is sufficient.
Anything less is a complete UX fail, particularly where new users are concerned.

That's a good point, those are generally underserved areas. There is also an entire class of underserved people who have zero access to banking. Billions of people, in fact. It was once thought Bitcoin (without LN) would help those people too.
Going right back to the original question, notwithstanding the added security, I do wonder why, for example, a drug dealer on a dark market website would not accept an alt crypto to avoid (for him and his customers) Bitcoin's high main chain fees (if/when we move into $x fee range).
A reminder that the miners who signed the HK commitment letter were told they could expect 100x today's fee per TX (per Jihan Wu)!

Core was on the edge of agreeing to increase the hard limit in December. Adam Back wanted 2-4-8. So there was no real problem with progressing with a HF. Core then invented the SegWit SF and chose to recommend that instead, claiming it to be safer. If the market says, "thanks but no, let's stick with the original plan", that does not mean the system is too easy to change. It just means that the Core devs' primary recommendation was considered and rejected. That is how Bitcoin should work ie the market should ultimately decide.

I think you're over playing it. Conservative hard fork increases are not an issue, if done properly. Even Adam Back was suggesting 2-4-8 in 2015.
The SegWit soft fork changes things for a number of reasons, and that's fine. I get that SegWit might use up available safe capacity short term. But I think the reluctance to increase the block size (future non-witness) has more to do with wanting to force a fee market and wanting to focus dev on specific projects, not safety. Certain Core devs have been quite open about that:

@_date: 2016-06-06 09:30:19

The HK consensus meeting - the subject of this very thread - changed everything. Yes, Greg M thinks the people involved are all dipshits, but the truth is the momentum was rallying behind Classic at the time and the dipshits saved the day for Core. Ask Samson Mow. Virtually all the miners wanted 2M (evidenced by the fact of the negotiations and resulting agreement).
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:08:26
Miners signing agreements to only run one implementation of Bitcoin should have been (was) a red flag.
@_date: 2016-06-20 11:07:30
Yes and no. Most miners are members of pools and it's the pools that actually decide. The network is made of a relatively small number of pools, so this will likely become commonplace  (if it's not already). Just means even less capacity for everyone else with more fee pressure. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 07:22:56

@_date: 2016-06-27 20:06:49
Huh? Adam Back and several prominent Core devs signed that commitment. There was serious momentum behind Classic at the time. Now one of the people involved has asked for clarification, probably because they have seen zero effort to stick to the terms of the agreement.
@_date: 2016-06-29 10:30:09
Bitcoin has been growing at a consistent rate for some years. Price is closely correlated to that growth in volume over time. Even with SegWit, Bitcoin will not have the capacity to continue that growth. Meaning ever higher TX fees and more instances of poor UX (people's TXs being delaying or getting stuck).
Bitcoin's network effects are incredibly powerful but those people - the ones who can't use Bitcoin because they have been priced out (already happening) - will necessarily look for an alternative. For argument's sake, Litecoin. They will create their own network effects and there is a risk that Bitcoin businesses and exchanges will then adopt Litecoin, strengthening its network effects. I'm no Eth fan but consider that a whole bunch of Bitcoin only companies quickly moved to accept Eth based on the recent uptick in interest. Not just Coinbase. A bunch of other exchanges too. And companies like Bitwage, BlockCypher, Lamassu. These things can happen quickly. So what if Litecoin (I'm no Litecoin fan either) successfully scales, offering a much cheaper alternative to Bitcoin? What if Bitcoin's LN takes years to come to fruition? Lots of 'what if's, all fears which may be unfounded.

You're not thinking big or long term. Bitcoin is still miniscule and irrelevant in capital markets terms. If it were to seriosuly catch on - with truly global adoption as a reserve currency of sorts - businesses in countries around the world would require and run fully validating nodes. Governments would require and run fully validating nodes. No one country or collaboration could ever interfere with that (just like they can't interfere with mining now, which is almost certainly dominated by huge mining farms).
No one is suggesting we immediately leap to impossibly big blocks and data centres, but if Bitcoin ever did get that big, it would already have won/be unstoppable. 
I should qualify by saying we don't really know what LN or sidechains will achieve or what their use cases will be. They might make these points moot, because they provide all the necessary scale, or they might not.
@_date: 2016-06-27 17:19:54

They seem to want it only ever so slightly more than SegWit (going by larger block signalling hash rate vs SegWit signalling hash rate). That number is trending (slowly) upwards but it's impossible to say whether it will creep up to 75%.
This is just hash rate of course. Ultimately, the hash rate won't create bigger blocks unless they're v confident the (economic) majority or supermajority will allow them. Right now, most nodes signal 1M.
@_date: 2016-06-27 16:06:53
Because 2M should still keep us within safe limits until a long term fix can be developed (maybe some form of flex cap?).
You're right though, we won't stop at 2M. Just like we progressed way beyond 56k, which was my first Internet connection. Now I'm on 100Mb.

Longest chain wins. If you have 51%, you can maintain the longest chain. If, however, you want to undo or double spend a TX in the current block, you would have to redo the work (to create your alternative block) *and* create the next block before the 49% extend the chain. Maybe that is what you mean.

This has never really been an argument of the Core devs AFAIK. Sure, hard forks should ideally use a high activation trigger and a long period of time for proper signalling and warning, but hard forks are not particularly difficult or dangerous. (They're not trivial either, of course, but then neither are some soft forks. Heck, didn't one soft fork update cause an unplanned hard fork?)
@_date: 2016-06-08 11:58:04
Fair IMO. Going into the halving with zero excess capacity was the least conservative approach.
SegWit, which isn't here yet, looks great for reasons other than short term scaling.
@_date: 2016-06-28 11:25:24

Agree! Up to 4M should be acceptable (that's SegWit, after all). It's not worth firing the miners over or forcing a UASFCS (chain split, in case you were wondering).

@_date: 2017-08-08 11:55:44
So from 4M to 8M (and 4/8M blocks will be pretty unusual -- it's not like we'll hit capacity with consistent 4/8M blocks).
And like I said, it's the most that I, personally, would accept short term.

Heck, Ver only joined the debate half way through. Who was paying people 3, 4, 5 years ago?
The inconvenient truth for you is that I'm a regular Bitcoiner. Like many others, I think we should have can-kicked a year or more ago (and I think Core collectively failed by not addressing full blocks long before now -- blame who you will for that*). I think SegWit is the way forward (being, now, after years of pointless delay, the quickest way we can get things moving again). If you check my history, you'll see I don't support BU's approach (I maybe would if the default settings were stricter). If Ver is paying me, he's getting a bad deal.
I also think this post says more about the debate than anything else -- a desire by the most influential Core devs to limit block size _for reasons other than "safety" or "security" or "decentralisation"_, all in their own words:

Agree with your conclusion, but the above is patently nonsense. Bitcoin will, in fact, require bigger blocks.

The recent price rises should mean the halving will be much ado about nothing, but I would hardly call that good planning by Core.

Yes, you can do that, no you're not nuts. Best practise is to still use new receive addresses though. Download a wallet on your mobile device that lets you import "watch-only" wallets. Copay or ArcBit on iOS work with Trezor, for example. Then, each time you want to send bitcoins to your hardware wallet, you select a new receive address using your mobile device (and you can monitor transactions, total balance, etc). Google for instructions, but in short you just need to import the extended public key (xpub) from your hardware wallet into your mobile wallet.

Miners will not mine on a chain where there are no users (or not enough users) to buy the coins they mine (or generate a sufficient number of fee paying TXs). It would not be profitable (or as profitable) for them.
So users running software with hard rules helps keep the miners honest. Hence we still have a 1M block size limit (if miners could easily change the rules without considering users' collective wishes, they would have done so by now). SegWit2x is interesting because it's an agreement between the miners and a very significant % of daily economic activity on the network. The miners can (arguably) afford to run rules that knock 90% of nodes (i.e. Bitcoin Core nodes) off the network because they know the remaining 10% actually represents enough economic activity that the coins they mine will retain most of the original value.
The difficulty, of course, is measuring economic activity/majority. Node count doesn't do it. Hash rate is irrelevant (except to say that hash rate follows users/value).

Actual doubling of capacity is not a side effect. 1.8x max, assuming 100% adoption, which may never happen. 1.3x plus is more accurate. Maybe we get to 1.7x.
I'm for SegWit but let's not oversell its capacity benefits.
@_date: 2016-06-25 08:52:45
Maybe you forgot that Adam B, Luke, Peter Todd and I think Matt C promised the miners hard fork code next month. SegWit will not activate before the halving - it might not even happen this year - and when it does the immediate impact may be small. This debate is far from over and things can change very quickly.
@_date: 2016-06-24 20:32:38


It's more than "slightly" but it's not "almost the same [as] 2 MB". 1.8M was believed to be the max, but that assumed 100% adoption and new addresses. See here: 
In any event, any additional capacity is welcome(!) and SegWit is beneficial in a whole bunch of other ways.

The NYA particpants _already decided_. They don't need to convince anyone of anything. They either stand firm on their agreement to fork in November or they don't. If they do, it's up to the remainder of the community to follow or not.
I think they know UASF types will attempt to keep the legacy chain alive via a hard fork difficulty adjustment (and maybe PoW change), but so far they seem willing to accept that. They think enough of the _economic activity_ will switch such that 2x becomes "Bitcoin" and any legacy forked chain will have an alt ticker.

Using the current breakdown of single sig vs multisig TXs, the expectation is that SegWit will allow (eventually, best case) 2.xMB blocks. In theory, SegWit allows for blocks up to 4MB in size, but because of the weight formula, such a block would be very unusual indeed - it would comprise mostly signature data for (very few) specially constructed SegWit TXs. A 4MB hard fork block size increase, on the other hand, would have allowed for 4MB of normal TXs (so more than the 2.xMB SegWit might one day provide*).
*SegWit may help usher in other efficiency gains (Schnorr sigs, MAST, etc) which might well allow more TXs to be squeezed into those 2.xMB blocks, and which might not be possible without SegWit.
[Edited for clarity.]
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:22:27
Fee estimation is, of course, a guessing game. Most fee guessing algorithms are slow to reduce their fees when average fees are dropping because fees are unpredictable and getting a TX stuck is arguably worse than overpaying slightly.
The irony is if all wallets had incredible fee guessing algorithms, and allowed users to fine tune them, the only result would be to spread the suffering more widely and ramp up the fee increases more quickly.
Now, Steam on LN could be great, but that still feels like a long way off.

It's an altcoin. Who said they couldn't/wouldn't mine any alts?
The only thing that matters hash rate -wise come November is legacy chain (Core, SegWit-only) hash rate vs 2x hash rate. The percentage hasn't changed (&lt;9% signalling Core/SegWit-only).
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:22:12
No success? SegWit2x single-handedly prevented the awkward chain split which would have happened had BIP148 nodes ceremoniously ejected themselves from the network. BIP148 didn't have anywhere near the support it needed to do anything other than a chain split and Core was watching from the sidelines! All in such a short time-frame too, a remarkable feat.
Of course, BCH came along and forced a split anyway, but that's by the by.

Is your preferred path for Bitcoin a low volume / high cost main chain? If so, what makes you think people will "just jump on board later"? Why would they bother if there are cheaper crypto options?
We've already seen Coinbase, Bitwage, Lamissu and BlockCypher expand to support one particular alt - how long before an alt develops its own network effects and becomes a bona fide alternative to Bitcoin?

It's a tough one. On the one hand, they literally have _millions_ of users (people who don't care about the block size). They have more than enough _users_ to provide them with _value_ and (arguably) win the "Bitcoin" name.
On the other hand, I take your point that a lot of _long time bitcoiners_ - the ones who are up-to-speed with the debate - might be against the hard fork on principle. Just query how many would actually hold out.
My gut feeling is there'll be a postponement of the 2x bit. But we'll get a better sense of the likelihood in a month or two.

Not in the face of an attack (as you like to call it). Surely the consensus immediately changes to protect users _at the point of the attack_? Or are you saying there would not be sufficient consensus for that?
The alternative seems to be the inconvenient truth: that SW2x isn't _that_ controversial after all (when faced with having to actually protect the legacy chain, few will bother because 2x is actually okay).
EDIT: SPV nodes are an issue, of course. They really do press home the importance of hash rate (but then hash rate wouldn't move without _economic majority_ support).

Let's imagine banks all decide they love Bitcoin and they all start making TXs. There are so many relatively high fee paying TXs that fees ramp up. Before long, it's $10 per TX. Still think no one would be priced out?
I'm exaggerating to make a point, but there are people in poorer countries for whom Bitcoin TXs are already considered expensive. Maybe LN will make all this moot, or maybe it won't -- it's still some way off AFAICT.
Agree on the security front but there are cheap to use alts that have not been hacked or otherwise compromised. They seem like a good option for those that can't afford Bitcoin.

To be fair, Garzik didn't sidestep the review process -- the accelerated 2x timeline is evidence of that (which was mostly the work of a Core dev). Rather he just rejected pointless noise around "consensus", simply because the issue of a HF had already been discussed to death (even SegWit+2M specifically, which had been introduced to the dev mailing list months earlier by Sergio L). That was the entire point of the NYA -- enough of the community stepping forward and committing to a plan _despite_ the wider community seemingly being stuck and unable to reach unanimous agreement.

BU does not change anything in this regard, so no. I haven't seen any BU supporter suggest this and it's certainly not in their roadmap. Fine if Peter R has his own views (I haven't seen that either) but suggesting that BU is heading that way is FUD (and I don't even support BU).
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:07:57
Maybe I wasn't clear. I would be amazed if, in the event of a fork initiated with the full support of all the NYA participants, with the legacy chain likely facing a PoW change _just to avoid an increase to 8M weight_, zero Core devs take it upon themselves to propose changes to Core to follow the new consensus rules or give Core users that option. But you're right, I don't know them and I don't pay them, and even if I did I suspect you imagine a scenario where such a change would not be merged out of spite, so maybe it's wishful thinking on my part. I'd have to use a different client in the meantime until Core re-emerges I suppose.

Yes, we have to accept that this time is a little different, Bitcoin Cash being a fork of Bitcoin and sharing the same blockchain up until block x.
Fortunately, they're being very careful to distinguish it as "Bitcoin Cash", complete with "BCC" ticker, even though they believe it's the way _Bitcoin_ should be (and, I dare say, they hope it will one day supplant legacy Bitcoin and be known simply as "Bitcoin").
I don't know, maybe I have a much higher tolerance for things like this, but feeling the need to re-brand it "Bcash" seems a lot like politicking/overly defensive/slightly fearful.
I actually quite like the name "Bcash", but I respect that that's not the name of this particular alt-born-from-fork.

@_date: 2017-08-01 16:13:16
Surely BCH doesn't ignore the TX history up to and including block 478558, does it? If you download and run a BCH full node, doesn't it download and validate the entire chain back to the Bitcoin genesis block (albeit applying different validation rules for TXs pre- and post-block 478558)? I can see why you'd have a snapshot as part of the wipeout protection scheme, but I would think it'd still validate old blocks/TXs.
(30 blocks behind, still no blocks found!)
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:13:36
BCH is not without its support. It's not only profitable for miners, that profitability has increased with each difficulty decrease; as of today (I think) BCH is as profitable to mine as BTC! It's not inevitable that BCH will slowly dwindle and die, although I think it should (insofar as it's just another alt that has no chance of competing with Bitcoin, IMO).
Crucially, BCH has been an altcoin from the start -- different name, different ticker, almost no community (infrastructure) support, etc. It has had to (will have to) grow its own community. Plenty of alts do that without dwindling and dying.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:33:21
No -- because of the weight formula, a 4MB SW block would necessarily contain mostly witness data (for very few - maybe even one - specially constructed SegWit transactions). If we apply SegWit and its weight formula to normal set of transactions, we'd get a 2.xMB block.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:58:31
I get that, I really do. If main chain TXs become prohibitively expensive for the 99%, Bitcoin will not have achieved its original goal, in my mind at least. My hope is that tech and infrastructure advance quickly enough that the absurdity of artificially too small blocks will be overwhelming. Still, I don't think we should rush it -- and I don't think we should make running a full node prohibitively expensive for individuals. And if BCH thrives and a network of $20k nodes proves to be sufficiently decentralised, great! I'll use that too!
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:39:22
I think he defines "hard fork" as being the whole or very nearly the whole of the Bitcoin community moving together to adopt new rules. I think. Maybe he will clarify.
Bitcoin Cash folk (and everyone waiting to sell) are waiting for Bcash miners to actually mine Bcash blocks (which hasn't happened yet). Once they do, they extend a new branch, separate from the main branch, but connected at the point the new branch was created (if it happens), i.e. they share Bitcoin's entire history right up to (and including) block 478558. I'm not sure why you wouldn't call the new branch a "fork" of the Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:21:37
It's no more an "attack" than any other alt. Heck, they went out of their way to add two way protections. If it prevails (big if!), it'd be because users wanted it to prevail and because "good enough" was good enough after all, with Core's approach being deemed too conservative and ultimately rejected.
I sold my BCH, much lower than its current price, so I'm salty too.

Agree, but not sure we can conclude that BIP148 led to SegWit2x. It certainly impacted SegWit2x's timeline, but did it prompt the NYA and had the NYA agreement not happened when it did, would it have happened later _because of BIP148_? I doubt it, TBH. All moot though.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:18:46
Agree, it's odd. Devil's advocate: I find it hard to believe that anyone running Bitcore is unaware of 2x, the November timeline for the HF and BitPay's position on it. But still, it's odd.
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:35:52
I disagree.
The NYA participants are, for now, standing firm. If they switch to 2x as planned (big if, but still, we should consider it), then virtually all _utility_ and a lot of _value_ switches too. Overnight.
Bitcoin Cash was entirely different -- it had/has no utility because no one accepts it. SegWit2x, on the other hand, comes with _Bitcoin's_ existing businesses and hash rate! BitPay doesn't accept Bitcoin Cash. Coinbase doesn't accept it. Most wallets don't even support it. All people can do right now with Bitcoin Cash is trade/attempt to dump it. SegWit2x is very different in that regard.
Don't forget, at the same time that utility and value shift to 2x, the legacy chain, with only nominal hash rate remaining, instantly loses _all_ it's utility -- it would require it's own hard fork just to survive! No doubt there'll be a particularly militant bunch that want to change PoW too, so we could end up with:
- SegWit2x chain, working well, with most existing businesses accepting it as "Bitcoin".
- new PoW chain, starting afresh and likely being trolled to death by CPU/GPU mining farms
- legacy chain w/ difficulty adjustment HF, probably being referred to by most of the community as "Bitcoin Classic"
- actual legacy chain (no hash rate and so probably dead at this point)
- Bitcoin Cash
Huge value dilution between the chains and for what? To avoid a mere 2x weight capacity bump.
In those circumstances, I think people would be crazy not to accept SegWit2x as "Bitcoin". Maybe if 2x was planned as a 16M or 32M block size increase - something that might strain my home connection short term - I too would refuse to accept it. But it's not. It's SegWit, with all the advantages that it brings, and it's a symbolic can kick as well, designed as a compromise to bring the community closer together (ha).
This is all just IMO _as a user_ (so whilst I'm not "calling for SegWit2x", I'm not dead against it either).

It's an alt that may or may not supplant Bitcoin as the number one crypto. Like any other alt.
They're not even the first to use "Bitcoin" in the name (though it would have been better if they didn't). And they added proper two way replay protections. I'm not a fan of BCH - at all - but I'm glad the infinitely big block crowd has gone its separate way and it's entirely different from 2x (which - its proponents say - _is_ Bitcoin, and so no replay protection, etc).
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:45:18

I know he said he's in no major rush, but that's still an understatement.
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:08:17
Not sure what you mean -- they literally just announced that they're going ahead with the hard fork. That means, come November, anyone that wants to stay on the legacy chain will need to do their own hard fork just to account for difficulty/replay/wipeout and perhaps change PoW. At that point all bets are off as to what is actually called Bitcoin (except that the 2x chain will be vastly more secure and actually usable, with established economic activity/support (BitPay, Coinbase, etc)).
I'm not saying I want this disruption but it looks like it's happening. Personally, I'm grateful for SegWit and the move from 4M to 8M _weight_ is fine by me. Without 2x I think we'd still be waiting for BIP149 and another year without SegWit or any capacity gain.
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:02:18
This is a real stretch (legally, which I assume was the point).
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:45:52


I think BCH supporters would argue the opposite. (I'm not one, to be clear.) Obviously there's nothing they can do about the name and the ticker issue, since even a minority branch with say 10% community support would keep the Bitcoin name and ticker in the short term. Clearly Bitcoin Cash folk believe BCH is an upgrade to Bitcoin -- if anything they're pushing the narrative that _Bitcoin+SegWit_ has branched away from Bitcoin (again, not something I believe).
I'm not arguing that Bitcoin Cash is _not an altcoin_, rather I'm saying it's an altcoin born by a subset of Bitcoin users who hard forked away from Bitcoin. That's why people call it a split or fork... because it is! I see little point denying that distinction (i.e. between Bitcoin Cash and other completely distinct altcoins). Just IMO.
EDIT: Might all be moot, they still haven't found a block. 23 blocks behind the main branch LOL.

Unfortunately, I think there are several prominent/very loud people who will never support a hard fork (other than in an emergency Bitcoin-will-fail situation), and that will likely always be enough for (an understandably conservative) Core to collectively determine that there's "no consensus".
That was always rbtc's primary complaint -- if Core couldn't bring itself to support and coordinate a simple can-kick increase during Bitcoin's bootstrap phase, in the face of constant UX issues and concerns raised by all the established Bitcoin business, why on Earth would anyone believe that a hard fork will ever be possible?
I agree that rbtc went downhill quickly. The bigger block cause also splintered into various subsets ($20k datacenter node types vs gentle increase types, SegWit admirers vs SegWit haters, miners make the rules vs users set the rules, etc), some more militant and vocal than others.

Correct. But given the profitability of mining SW2x when it happens, that seems unlikely.
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:50:49
I am hopeful the push for 2x will fall away, but I would expect a healthy subset of Core devs to at least take the prospect of a hard fork seriously (if it does look like happening), given the economic and hash rate support it (seemingly) has. As a user, I'd follow those businesses/hash rate for the sake of a mere 2x (actually I'll hold on all chains). The legacy chain would likely need to fork anyway just to survive, which means everything's an alt at that point.
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:07:52
Yes and no. All other things being equal (and ignoring that Chinese pools are undoubtably hosting some hash rate from outside China) China closing and then re-opening the Great Firewall would seriously screw up the Bitcoin network (the chain outside China would get re-org'd out of existence). The Rest of the World would have to purposefully reject the new, valid, more work chain from China. Geographical concentration should be a concern to everyone.
@_date: 2016-06-08 06:47:10
That is not worst case.
- a bunch of miners drop off
- those that stay start to sell more of their coins than usual to keep mining
- massive trading because of the halving and price speculation 
- except blocks are already full, and they're being processed more slowly, so TX backlogs and horrible user experience ensues 
- most software is now better at adjusting fees + miners increasingly desperate to sell their coins = fees quickly rising and price quickly falling
- speculators panic and start to sell
- miners need to sell more because of falling prices, speculators betting on halving price increase now cutting their losses
- massive downward spiral - for those who can get their TXs processed - resulting in more miners leaving
FWIW I'm hodling throughout.

All those things are cheaper, faster and more widely available month by month and year by year.
I get that this is an argument against _really big blocks_ where, if we had them now, nodes would require datacenters, but we don't need _really big blocks_ now and by the time we do (if we ever do), who knows what will be possible? This argument doesn't really hold weight against conservative increases in the block size limit. There's no technical reason the max limit can't be at 2, 3 or 4M right now (ignoring the rest of the debate and the advent of SegWit SF).

Meanwhile, Peter Todd says he's "pretty dubious" about changing the 21m limit now. Not "dead against", just "pretty dubious". He, like Peter R, realises few would agree to change the limit and therefore the limit is unlikely to change.

There used to be an answer to this question, but that was back when hash power and economic majority were signalling in favour of Core. Now node count is touted as most important but, as you note, it's easily Sybil attacked.
In theory: Bitcoin's rules are those being run by the economic majority i.e. that which gives bitcoins value; more specifically, that which generates the greatest demand/highest value for bitcoins mined and sold to the market by miners. If that econ majority signals in favour of something other than the Bitcoin Core roadmap, however...

A second incompatible implementation however...
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:00:01
I doubt it.
Everyone needs to _move their coins to SegWit addresses_ before they can actually send SegWit TXs. There may even be a rush, initially - that will just add to the backlog. Blocks post SegWit activation may start to include increasing numbers of SegWit TXs, but that's unlikely to reduce the backlog of legacy TXs for some time (since the _new_ SegWit TXs will just be cutting in line ahead of the unconfirmed legacy TXs). I think this'll be a much slower process than you think (but I'd love to be wrong!).

In my mind, no. You either stand for free, open discussion, or you don't.


The censorship/moderation did not happen _before the tech debate_, it happened because of it (to support one side of the debate, in fact). Tough for people to continue a serious tech debate in those circumstances.
@_date: 2016-11-14 09:38:24
No, I think larger block supports believe the resilience of the network is not compromised by larger blocks (presumably the underlying point here). They would argue that larger blocks -&gt; cheaper TXs -&gt; continued TX growth -&gt; more users -&gt; more full nodes -&gt; greater resilience.
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:17:47
It's also based on 100% adoption, which may never happen. Any small bump is welcome but "2.1MB upon activation" is incorrect.
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:45:21
There might be some truth to the "not as good as a hard fork" in the sense that SegWit SF only fixes certain things for SegWit TXs i.e. there could be any number of old nodes and old style TXs long into the future, which could impact the effectiveness of LN, UTXO bloat, etc. If - as those people believe - well handled hard forks aren't an issue, then it makes sense to want to realise all the benefits of SegWit for all transactions.

Except we know that the network can handle bigger blocks. So saying it "doesn't work" is patently false. There's no question that L2 solutions will be important but this idea that blocks must be very small and permanently full is, frankly, _unproven_ (and IMHO the arguments against - slippery slope and fear of HFs - are BS). 
Was it reckless to not support a can kick? Maybe. It may ultimately lead to a contentious HF if enough of the community rejects the new direction. Would it have been worth it then?
Maybe some modified version of Luke-Jr's HF code will gain traction and pull everyone together again. SegWit doesn't seem to be doing that yet, unfortunately.

In your slightly ridiculous scenario, it would be a matter of who blinks first.
Users want their bitcoins to retain value too(!) and they want their TXs to be processed(!), so more likely than not they'd add a fee rather than insisting on zero fee.
For the miner, it makes sense to process TXs in fee order and create block space scarcity for very low/zero fee paying TXs by _not processing them_.
I think the miners would win that one. As indeed they did pre full blocks.

Were you there? Did the miners organise the SegWit2x deal or was it Barry Silbert's initiative? I think you're assuming too much TBH.
Most people - certainly most Core devs - were dismissing the BIP148 UASF as a nothing burger, something that would be over before it started. It seemed to get way more attention once the SegWit2x decided to adapt its timeline to cover it.
Not rewriting history, it's just the way non-BIP148 UASFers see it.

Huh, did not know that. I'm surprised BCH nodes don't present themselves as BTC nodes for the purposes of peering and bootstrapping up to block 478558. If they just peer a UTXO snapshot among themselves, then agree, it's not much better than BTX.
AFAICT, BTX's first block contains the full balance of premined BTX coins (i.e. a genesis TX in an amount equal to, in aggregate, the Bitcoin UTXO set at the time the snapshot was taken): 
BTX coins are claimable by Bitcoin holders, but not automatically available them (i.e. not linked to the same Bitcoin addresses) --
 so slightly different to Bitcoin Cash.

I'm fine with calling Bitcoin Cash an "altcoin", but the argument that it's _not_ [an altcoin born as a result of] a Bitcoin fork seems terribly strained. The argument also falls apart as the level of community support gets higher -- so imagine Bcash had 60%+ support, or 90%+ support. Still not a fork? Still merely an alt that has zip to do with Bitcoin? Semantics, I suppose.

Probably some truth in that. I think most would also say that the short term capacity gains of a 2M-4M can kick would still be better than SegWit + Schnoor + MAST + anything else that might be realised in the short term (if indeed those things are doable in the next year or two).
Of course a HF would take time to orchestrate even if it were properly supported, whereas the SegWit code is here, so...

Coinbase does not exist. BitPay does not exist. 90% of the Bitcoin network's hash rate does not exist. Blockchain.info does not exist. What are you smoking?
I'm a Bitcoin _user_ and my assessment is: I want Core or SW2x to dominate such that all the economic activity and hash rate concentrates on one chain. SW2x seems most likely TBH. (Actually, I think one side will back down -- it could be either.)
To be clear: I do not believe in "cripplecoin" (I'd be fine with Core's SegWit-only plan, it would not be handing control to Blockstream/AXA/whoever). I do not believe in "corporatecoin" (I'd be fine with SegWit2x, it would not centralise Bitcoin or hand control to corporates). Both arguments are blown way out of proportion. Bitcoin will find its way (I'd rather that it did so in a non-messy way, of course).

Not sure why you were down-voted, nor why people seem to think hard forks are now impossible in Bitcoin or even that Bitcoin is too political. Bitcoin doesn't care; it is the software people run and it will evolve as such. If there's a split, there's a split, but it would have to be highly contentious for the minority branch to survive -- in fact, it would almost certainly require its own hard fork, at which point it can hardly claim to be "the original Bitcoin" anyway.

Only you define a hard forks as "everyone updates together". In reality, no one does because we know full well Bitcoin can hard fork and move on - after a critical bug fix, for example - without 100% of users updating their software.

We're _years_ into this debate and neither of those things are anything yet (as welcome as they are). Proper L2 is even further away.
There will be a bump with SegWit, if it activates, but it's 0.7M _after everyone upgrades_, which may never actually happen. Things like Schnorr and MAST offer efficiencies that will provide similar bumps, but even taken together they pale in comparison to an increase to 4M (happy to be proven wrong on this - I haven't done the math).
A hard fork will be way harder as we leave the growth and bootstrap phase, so you're really betting everything on L2 -- a _very_ different (and still largely theoretical) Bitcoin where payments require pre-funding, etc. Seems risky TBH.

Right now, there are a lot of transactions waiting to be processed.
Wallets have reasonably good fee guessing algos, but they can't _all_ be right -- there is only so much space after all.
You could look to use a wallet that has RBF or CPFP or that lets you set a very high fee if you're in a rush, but that won't help you get newly acquired bitcoins out of Circle any quicker (you are necessarily relying on them to guess the fee correctly).
If all this sounds far from idea, well, it kinda is.

His argument against Mycelium on a mobile was basically this:
- If you have ever used your mobile to visit a porn site, it is compromised.
- There could be malware running on your phone that monitors Bitcoin apps.
- When you view your seed on screen (during the initial Mycelium back-up process), the malware will send a screenshot of your seed to the attacker.

People transacting invariably price TX fees in their fiat currency -- that won't change unless we eventually close the loop. So someone willing to pay $1 to rush a TX through today will be willing to pay $1 to rush a TX through then, regardless of the FX price.

What people are questioning - and making a fairly innocuous but principled statement against - is concentration of development in (and over reliance on) one reference client and a handful of devs and the apparent disregard for open and frank discussion around what Bitcoin is and what it should be. Not exactly controversial yet some immediately label it anti-Core propaganda or an attack on Bitcoin. Sigh.
@_date: 2016-12-26 19:46:04
1M is a very real constraint; any significant disruption will require very significant numbers of TXs. People bang on about VISA levels of consumer TXs, but the truth is that any truly disruptive impact - be it as a global reserve currency, wholesale b2b, cross border, commodity trading, interbank transfers - would require equally large TX volumes. If Bitcoin is to become significant (in my mind that means significant in capital markets terms), an increase from 1M will be required (even if only for the opening and closing of channels for eg Lightning).

Just because he's frustrated that Bitcoin's TX volume growth has been retarded by the 1M limit - even though people were fully aware this would happen _years ago_, and now he has to reluctantly pivot from the Bitcoin business idea he had years ago, because it's no longer viable - does not make him an idiot.

The unfortunate thing about the whole "debate" is that both sides seek to reduce the other sides' arguments to:

- Bigger block supporters: Infinite blocks now without any thought to network constraints

You're right, a real time audit view of the bitcoins backing your bearer certs would help (at least right up until the point at which they are stolen and are no longer backing your bearer certs).

This makes sense doesn't it? Given that most fee guessing algos merely look at the fees in the last block.

SW2x is entirely different. Replay is not "low hanging fruit". Implementing it effectively cements SW2x's fate as an alt coin. They don't want that. They want the update to be "Bitcoin".

Hmm. luckdragon69 seemed to be suggesting that by wanting bigger blocks, Ver is "selling out security for adoption" -- the implication being: bigger blocks = bad for security.

@_date: 2016-12-07 15:44:18
Very possibly. My only point was that it coincided with a very obvious shift in terms of devs and start-ups opting (rightly or wrongly!) for Ethereum over Bitcoin, partly for the "smart contract" features and partly for the cheaper TXs (and easy creation of cheap to transact tokens). That's all you'd hear at conferences and meet-ups at the time.
Slightly amusing that people like Samson Mow are all over ETC right now (given that "code is law" was still a thing for ETH at the time).

Hmm, disagree. It shows devs making decisions based on their view of the _economics_ of Bitcoin, primarily. Things like, "let's test that fee market now by keeping capacity limited rather than later". That's not an engineering reason.
Similarly, when a Core dev and Blockstream employee says something like "but if we give them capacity, they might not need the other awesome capacity solutions we're working on [in our for-profit company]". Engineering reason?
I don't buy into any conspiracy around this stuff, but the quotes are revealing. The Core devs involved clearly go beyond engineering/crypto/programming (and FWIW, I think they have to - it's Bitcoin, right?). Even GMax says something along the lines of "I agree, a block size increase isn't really an issue [but slippery slope argument]". Again, not really an engineering reason.
(I wouldn't call them strictly political either.)

FWIW I thought his presentation was good. He came across well, not remotely the crazy I was expecting.
Oh, the other thing he said was that someone in future will dominate mining by using billions of IoT devices. Which I thought was odd, given his new investment in a mining op.

Some would say Bitcoin is already under political control. Just look at the HK agreement; Core devs making promises to miners to ensure that only Core compatible software was run. Key communication channels being very careful managed (with the tacit approval of Core devs). Could it get any more political than that?
Some would say we should resist this sort of political control at all costs.
The protocol rule will only ever be eliminated if the community so decides. That is not a failed experiment.

But what does that even mean? How do you politically corral a network into upgrading? By what political means? Ver and others _voicing their opinions_? Ver creating a mining pool or an alternative channel to discuss Bitcoin related topics that are now banned in other channels? The offer of support to developers of alternative clients?
It sounds to me like you want to bundle the bigger block cause and all bigger block supporters' voices, opinions and actions together and neatly label it "an attack on Bitcoin by political means".
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:14:26


Not really, because other full nodes - the ones that are actually making/receiving TXs - do that validation anyway! So who do you actually think you are helping protect? Maybe, at a push, miners see one more node "enforcing" a particular set of rules, but node count is easily Sybil'd anyway. At best, you're helping with bootstrapping.
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:02:12


Save that _legacy_ nodes do not receive the signature data for SegWit TXs; it is stripped out of the blocks that they receive. A merkle tree of the SegWit TX sig data is still present, stored in the coinbase TX of each block. The legacy nodes just don't do anything with it. Rather they rely on _upgraded_ (SegWit) nodes on the network to validate SegWit TX signature data.
(Meant for the OP's benefit, obviously, but I now realise the OP was inquiring more generally about how SegWit TXs are linked to their sig data.)

Ver has been very consistent in his message. For years. His motivations are very obvious to anyone who has heard him speak. If you don't know what they are, then your comment is as useless as this medium rant. I think he _honestly_ believes hitting the 1M limit was a mistake.
FWIW, Ver said that his pool would not block SegWit (meaning if everyone signals support, he will signal his support too -- obviously only relevant if his pool amasses a lot more hash rate).

Miners are under zero obligation to include those no fee TXs. They can mine an empty block and still take the block reward. So no, that is not what I think.
Go back and look what was happening _before full blocks_. Zero fee TXs were already being ignored and very low fee transactions were already very slow to confirm. Even with excess block space. That means miners - or at least a sufficient proportion to matter - were already actively weeding them out by not accepting zero/very low fee TXs.
Not sure why you think that would change if we returned to a state of excess block space. Fees may shrink, sure, but _all_ miners have costs they need to cover (especially important as the block reward reduces).

It's a bit harsh to describe Bitcoin businesses as "freeloading" when (a) they likely run one or more full nodes (economically important nodes at that!) that wouldn't otherwise exist, (b) they generate TXs and pay fees on all those TXs, increasing network security, and (c) they bring new users in and/or make Bitcoin more useful for existing users, promoting Bitcoin's all-important network effects.
They are, collectively, responsible for the majority of daily transactions and the majority of value being transmitted and the majority of fees being paid to miners. Yet now that relative success is a bad thing. Making Bitcoin useful is now "freeloading".
It's also tough to blame anyone who built their business on the incredibly positive and compelling idea (societally speaking) of Bitcoin as a globally accepted currency. After all, Bitcoin users were pushing that narrative _from day one_. Think about it: was the narrative more "Bitcoin for the unbanked" or "Bitcoin for capital flight for China's richest"? Indeed most Bitcoin businesses were built by _early Bitcoin adopters/users_ -- they grabbed the narrative and ran with it. Naïve, perhaps, but they represent much of what got us this far.
Bitpay lets me buy games on Steam FFS. Exactly what Satoshi was talking about in his white paper! (Okay, maybe he imagined Steam accepting Bitcoin directly, but you get my point.) Bitpay lets kids in countries not usually served by Steam - or that don't have access to their parent's credit card - use Steam. Friction removed, exactly what was intended. Are those transactions now "spam" and Bitpay "freeloading"? Surely not. Heck, it's what I signed up for when I started running my own full node (to support a network that supports those use cases).
EDIT: None of this is to say I support the idea of BU.

He largely defeats his own rebuttal on the first point:


... Or they could just run non-mining full nodes and then reject offending miners' blocks until they mine in accordance with the correct rules.
Hard to disagree with his conclusion, however:


We are already at a point where only a tiny % of Bitcoin users run a full node. Nothing will increase that number (in any meaningful way). The question really is where do you draw the line? He seems to draw it at "hobbyists", which is not unreasonable. I draw it at roughly the level of capability of my own hardware and broadband connection (so I'd be fine with SW2x or up to 8M blocks, for example). Others may draw it lower (Raspberry Pi on dial-up, with Blockstream sat support, maybe). I do think we should take it slowly though (my time preference has certainly adjusted over the last couple of years). Let BCH do its thing and see how it works out. If the NYA participants go ahead with their HF, well, then we have 3-4 chains to monitor/HODL/buy/sell.

On the flip side it's seems inevitable that there will be very desirable upgrades to Bitcoin that require a hard fork. Demonising HFs now is less than ideal.
People always refer to alts as test nets... Well, not if they dev compelling features that would require an impossible to co-ordinate Bitcoin HF. Then they become bona fide alternatives (hopefully complementary, or side-chained or something, but not guaranteed).

There does seem to be a genuine concern that committing to this path now won't actually offer much in terms of capacity gains* and any attempt to introduce a decent bump later will be thwarted by people who use the SegWit structure as an excuse ("hey we can't increase non-witness to 4M because we still need the discount and any such increase would introduce an xMB attack vector"... for example).
The inconvenient truth is 4M now (I know, hard fork demonization has probably made this impossible) would offer way more capacity (and therefore more breathing room, cheaper TX and better growth potential - all during this bootstrap phase where we still have the benefit of the block reward) than SegWit + Schnoor + MAST combined (not that those features aren't also very desirable!).
*LN is the big hope, of course, but it's just nowhere near ready for prime time.
Personally, I say let's just get SegWit done. The damage (public perception, TX volume growth, business use cases, etc) has likely already been done. Let's regroup and set our hopes and expectations a few years further into the future.

Then I think you misunderstand. I am talking about empty blocks that are found during the brief period of time _before_ the relevant miner can download and verify all the transactions in the then current block. In other words, the miner couldn't include transactions even if he wanted to -- it would be reckless and risky (we did see this once; it was an expensive lesson for the miner and the miners building on top of the not properly validated blocks).
A miner finding and propagating an empty block in that brief period has no negative impact on the network*; if anything, it is a positive for network security, because it adds another confirmation to transaction already included in the blockchain.
*I suppose a miner could keep his empty block secret on the off-chance that he finds the next block after it, which he could used to orphan any competing block - a selfish mining attack - but I don't think we've seen any evidence of that.

I'm just going to say it: hindsight is a wonderful thing. At the time of the blog post, it's fair to say there was enormous momentum behind Ethereum. Ether was destined to compete _at some level_ with bitcoins (i.e. as tokens for storing and transferring value) and the "smart contract" functionality of Ethereum set it apart from other alts.
At the same time, Coinbase was very vocal about the direction Bitcoin was heading in: zero growth. (Yay, we got there!) Adding ETH to their exchange was a no brainer _at the time_ (before The DAO).
Could The DAO debacle and the subsequent bailout forks have been predicted? I'm not so sure. Where would Eth be now had they not happened? Who knows. Would the blog post still be up? Probably not, they took the whole blog down.

That's fine and dandy but a hard fork will never be carried out by 100% of users simultaneously.

Right, but it sure as hell means something when Core devs want the fees to go _a lot higher_. This is only the beginning (assuming demand for those TXs persists despite much higher fees). Reminder: at the HK meeting, the miners were told they should expect 100x the current fees _per transaction_.

Also the very words "coup attempt" presuppose a controlling party from wish others attempt to wrest power. So which is it: do we have a controlling party or not? Or could it simply be that some Core devs and the Bitcoin businesses they were talking to regularly really honestly believed that _halting transaction volume growth_ was the wrong thing and an overly conservative commit process for the reference client was (wrongly) a bottleneck for progress?

This is not quite right. Fees were a thing long before full blocks. Miners will collectively determine fees (more so as block reward disappears).

I think you would be very hard pushed to find a single Core dev that would agree with that blanket statement. A 2M hard fork could have been done perfectly safely. It might have taken a while, but still. The SegWit soft fork route, however, was the _preferred_ route for Core.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:41:08
It is contentious, but I guess it's more contentious to some than others.
I don't believe 100% consensus (some call it "extreme consensus") on changes will ever be possible, so I'm willing to be a bit more pragmatic.
Is SW2x so bad and so nefarious that I should reject it point blank, support a change of PoW and head in the other direction? I'm not convinced, sorry. I don't buy the "corporatecoin" arguments any more than I buy the "cripplecoin" arguments! I do think miners' and businesses' interests should be considered (and perhaps have not been to date). I mean, literally 90% of the hash rate is willing to walk away (with the support of the biggest businesses in Bitcoin) -- that must tell you something.
If the NYA was about $20k nodes and introducing AML/KYC, then I'd be convinced. But it's not; it's an optimistic case of 4.xMB blocks with SegWit. I'll accept that (if/when it happens).
(I'd still much rather the two sides come together and avoid a messy split, of course, however that happens -- if SW2x were dropped or if Core determined to support the HF.)

I actually think Classic had some momentum prior to the HK agreement.
In what world though would Bitcoin users collectively hit the nuclear annihilation button and _fire all the miners_, starting afresh with zero hash rate, just because the miners signed a letter temporarily committing to Core-compatible code for the near future? No one is that impatient.
As welcome as SW, Schnoor, MAST, etc are, the harsh truth is a simple, community coordinated 4M can-kick could have provided more short term scale than all those things combined (and let's face it, we'll be lucky to see the benefit of those things next year or maybe even the year after). It could also have provided more time for a non-divided community to work on those and other longer term solutions. Instead we had the ridiculous slippery slope argument that any-little-increase-now-will-lead-to-multi-gig-blocks -- weak sauce.
That's just IMO and all this is merely a difference of opinion, of course, but Bitcoin being _difficult to change_ doesn't make that opinion go away.

Hmm, there seem to be plenty of people who are dead set against any suggestion of a hard fork though (which is needed if we are to remove/update the 1M max block size limit). People have dug their heels in during the course of the block size debate. Hence theymos' remark:


Can't think why! Nothing to do with the censorship here, and the promotion of the petty "all hard forks = altcoins" mantra, I'm sure.

You can't expect a corp to accept Bitcoin right off the bat. It's still (relatively) volatile, the relevant corps are unlikely to have Bitcoin devs/experts on hand to manage Bitcoin acceptance and even if they did, they would almost certainly immediately convert the bitcoins received using, you guessed it, a third party exchange.
We have an awfully long way to go before those corps start using bitcoins themselves. In the meantime, I for one am very pleased to see quasi adoption via enablers like BitPay.
(Steam is an excellent example and their implementation using BitPay is great. It has undoubtedly introduced Bitcoin to new users and enabled payments from people who might otherwise not have been able to pay.)

It's a really nice cap (the poker chips are awesome too). I didn't buy the cap though because it was seemingly created to ridicule and mock Bitcoiners who dared to suggest that raising the max block size _might not be a bad thing_ (ironically, an opinion once shared by your COO Samson Mow).
Now, however, things seem to have come full circle. I might pick one up. The cap unwittingly acknowledges that SegWit is pretty much Bitcoin's Hillary Clinton. Time to Make Bitcoin Great Again*.

The block reward (by which I mean the coinbase transaction in each block i.e. new bitcoins created). It started at 50 bitcoins per block and it is cut in half roughly every 4 years. It is currently 12.5 bitcoins.
The reward was (is) purposefully high to make block generation (mining) profitable and therefore attractive.
The idea was to ramp up hash rate (read: security) quickly.
This is "bootstrapping" -- heavily subsidising mining via the block reward to get Bitcoin to a stage where it is relatively safe from hash rate related attacks.
The bootstrapping phase is ongoing until the block reward is significantly less relevant (in terms of total miner reward per block) -- there is a long transition from block reward to fees.
It worked very well (and, of course, Bitcoin had the added benefit of being the first cryptocurrency and flying under the radar).
@_date: 2016-11-16 18:03:27

Two things are odd about Mow's shittweeting and trolling (and his pretty obvious control of other Twitter troll accounts).
It's really odd for a big company of any description, even in the Bitcoin space. Step back for a second and imagine the Kraken COO taking it upon himself to follow and constantly trolling Adam B or Peter T on Twitter. It would be odd, right? Any other C level at any other company on this earth would expect complaints to roll in about his or her public behaviour if they acted as Mow does.
It's particularly odd because Mow himself was a big block supporter. He was turned in a 2 hour chat with Adam B (according to Mow). So a cosy chat with Adam B and now he's one of 4-5 full time Twitter trolls who seemingly does nothing but follow and comment on Ver, Garzik, Andreson and anyone else who dares suggest that bigger blocks _are okay_. I mean, does that not seem odd to you?

Wasn't 4M determined to be about the most the network could _safely_ handle (a while back, before advances in block propagation)? 3M or even 2M gives the same answer anyway (more capacity).
Also SegWit opens up a 4M attack vector (with enough witness junk, blocks can be 4M big). But who cares about, you know, keeping Bitcoin working? (Not suggesting 4M is a problem, just throwing your argument back at you.)

I have used Bitcoin a few times though. I once bought temporary access to a VPN (it was a couple of $ to an overseas entity and there was no need to provide any details - Bitcoin is perfect for that sort of thing). I also got some family members set up with Coinbase accounts so I can send them money more easily (cross border from the UK), which actually works great. Then a week or so ago my wife lost one of our linked credit cards, which meant all the cards had to be cancelled and replaced. I went to buy something on Steam and the card was declined... Bitcoin to the rescue! It's a really smooth experience on Steam (using BitPay) -- just scan the barcode and boom, start the download. It saved me from entering a bunch of card details for a card I wouldn't otherwise want to use. Sure, once I get my replacement cards I'll be using them, but Bitcoin was invaluable at that moment in time. (Steam is a great example too because there are people that might not be able to pay any other way -- kids without access to credit cards, or in jurisdictions where payments aren't accepted.)
But yes, agree with your point.

Such a BS response. If you want to benefit fully from SegWit, you really want _everyone_ to fully adopt SegWit too. All the people you have zero control over. They help choose whether blocks are full and whether we ever see 2.x MB blocks. It's difficult for _everyone_ to adopt SegWit when the _reference client_ (Core) hasn't fully implemented it yet. FWIW I think we'll see a decent uptick then.

No disrespect, but you're just spouting Luke-Jr's latest tirade.
Miners have diversified. It's the new, harsh reality. Their reasoning is (perceived) stagnation. They see no technical reason for restricting the block size and, to be honest, I struggle too. This has been a years long debate and now it's obvious -- a lot of people have decided it's too little, too late. The hope that some had in 2x is gone. It's going to be a bumpy ride. Best to forget the gains of the last couple of months and buckle down for a serious bout of HODLing. I think it's a short term pump, but who knows? :)
Full disclosure, I will HODL throughout and I sold all my BCH. That may have been an error, frankly. Or it may not.
EDIT: The really unfortunate thing is, only ~26% of BCH was sold so far. Meaning the vast majority of bitcoin HODLers are actually also HODLing BCH, despite what you read on Reddit and Twitter. Think about that.

You purposefully missed out the only two words I emphasised in bold. “Right now.” Back in 2015! Even if SegWit2x had happened, we wouldn’t have seen 8M blocks for years (if at all, just like we won’t see 4M SegWit1x blocks for years, if at all). But that’s fine, continue to cite an article that it’s own author now ignores.
@_date: 2015-08-06 20:21:46
Generally agree, but much depends on the proposed use case.  I would add (as a possible advantage) that Bitcoin is available immediately to anyone and everyone.  I suspect at least some of the difficulty deploying closed chains is convincing all relevant parties to sign up to the same chain or multiple compatible chains -- even internally, at a corporate, such a consensus (no pun) can be difficult to achieve.  Years of meetings, testing, etc.  I want to see deployment of closed chains in real world applications.  It seems inevitable and there are plenty of people working very hard to make it happen, so presumably only a matter of time before we see something substantive.  For now, though, everything seems to be behind closed doors.


Perhaps, but with obvious trade-offs.  Precisely how is consensus achieved?  Or do all participants assume no attempt (intentional or otherwise) to double spend (because know-your-node and know-your-miner)?


Not sure about this.  I would argue closed chain operators have increased exposure and potential liability.  Consider a handful of corporates operating a chain (assuming you could get them to give up control of the chain and trust each other, a big ask), each is effectively responsible for all the recordkeeping (not just for their own transactions) and for the smooth running of the chain generally.  Each one would be a target if anything were to go wrong -- effectively joint and several liability.  I suppose they could all indemnify each other, but that would detract somewhat from any cost savings vs the status quo or indeed vs using Bitcoin.


I don't think a "permissioned" ledger could ever achieve the level of security that Bitcoin currently enjoys (or if it could, it would be unreasonably costly).  Whilst I agree we don't know that Bitcoin will always work the way it does, new blocks continue to be buried under more blocks, and the likelihood of that work being re-done and the existing record rewritten (beyond, say, a few blocks) is infinitesimal.
More generally, Bitcoin as a game-theoretic proposition is effective precisely because it invites anyone - good or bad - to participate.  The security dynamic for closed chains is entirely different; they require a much, much smaller set or subset of participants, whose incentives may not aligned, to maintain the truth.  That opens up a raft of new questions.  
 


Agree, although presumably within a controlled environment and possibly with the risk of uncertainty, depending on the design.


Agree (might even be a disadvantage for Bitcoin -- public record not always desirable).

Bitcoin price is v volatile at the moment -- it moves up and down, sometimes quickly. It may also be overpriced; or it may not. Everyone experiences what you have experienced; as soon as you hit the buy button, the price drops like a stone. Like it was a trap. Historically, however, holders (or "hodlers") have not suffered losses. Most people expect the price of Bitcoin to reach new all time highs sooner or later.
To put this into perspective, lots of people bought in at ~$1,150 in late November 2013 -- lucky them, right? Except they had to watch (those that could stomach it) the price go down over the next _two years_(!) to $170 -- an 85% loss. If they continued to hold, they did v well indeed. Of course, on the flip side, past performance is no guarantee.
The market is way more mature now than then (but still barely a toddler, in capital market terms), so I wouldn't expect a long bear market like 2014-15. But a correction after such a wild run up over the last month was (is) probably inevitable.

Huh? Miners are earning more money now than ever. It would be in their short term interests to keep blocks small and fees high. In fact, they were accused of doing precisely that (when "blocking" SegWit)!
The unfortunate truth is that miners have been very consistent over the years. Since 2013 they have called for a meaningful increase in capacity (with or without SegWit). We don't have that.

@_date: 2015-08-06 22:25:18


Hmm, another thing to add to my reading list.
 


Very possibly true!  I did have in mind the number of nodes/validators and concentration issues too i.e. absent big spending on distributed infrastructure, there will invariably be far fewer nodes/validators/transaction signers on a private or closed chain (meaning very clear points of possible failure/targets for attack).  Completely random example: how can corp A trust that Bob in IT at corp B will not to be compromised and hand over corp B node/validator license keys to someone else?  What if a black market develops?  What security measures would be necessary at every level (chain (i.e. rules, which may impact performance), participant (contractual constraints, etc), node/validator (oversight, internal sign-offs))?  A very important closed chain might mean regulation and dedicated compliance personnel, as for AML.  But how secure is that, really?
I have no doubt people are thinking about all these things; it will be fascinating to watch it all develop.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:35:18
Encouraging, but I just meant it will likely be a while before we're using LN routinely for real things (i.e. before it will really impact main chain TX fees and introduce new use cases/re-introduce old use cases that were priced out). Obviously, the sooner the better!
@_date: 2015-08-11 09:47:04


^ This.  I don't think anyone would vote for 1MB if the limit was treated as removed and consensus was required to decide a new limit/formula for a limit.  Unfortunately, sitting on the fence means voting for 1MB, which (in my mind at least) could prove costly -- how can anyone take Bitcoin seriously with this kind of a scalability issue (i.e. Bitcoin seemingly hobbled by a very small group of people can't make their minds up)?

Whilst I take the point, I don't actually see anyone proposing PayPal 2.0, unless by "PayPal 2.0" you actually mean a decentralised, censor resistant version of PayPal that is not a corporate entity and in fact looks nothing like PayPal?
In the end, it's shades of gray. Even in the extreme big block case - Fake Satoshi's $20k nodes - a requirement for commercial grade internet connections or datacenters does not preclude censorship resistance. If businesses and committed hobbyists in every country in the world are running full nodes, it would be impossible to shut down. Don't get me wrong, I'd rather not test that now, and I'm personally on-board with Core's approach to scaling, but referring to _any meager increase_ over and above 4M weight as "PayPal 2.0" is silly.

Correct, which is quite a difficult concept to grasp for newcomers (insofar as it seems ridiculous at first -- until you realise why (i.e. proof of work to achieve consensus and secure the network) and that all modern payment methods (e.g. credit cards) take days or even weeks to settle).

This was written before Compact Blocks and FIBRE. BitFury, the author, wanted SegWit2x. Pointing to that report (which isn’t even an argument against 8M weight anyway — it was an argument against an immediate jump to (full) 8M blocks) is silly. We don’t need another written report for that.

I think you mean "stop overpaying and then complaining about it".
Nothing wrong with "overpaying" per se; people do that to guarantee (as far as possible) next block confirmation. They can pay as much as they want.

Miners compete to find the next block (oversimplification). If two miners find valid blocks at around the same time, one of those blocks will make it into the blockchain and the other will be abandoned (orphaned). There might be a brief period where different miners around the world try to extend different chains (ie some mining atop the block that ultimately makes it vs some mining atop the block that is ultimately orphaned). That’s less than ideal (it’s a waste of hash rate and it means 1 confirmation is less secure than it otherwise would be).
Now reduce the difficulty such that blocks are found every minute on average. There’d be a lot more orphans, more wasted hash rate and each confirmation would be less meaningful.
Satoshi’s 10 minute period was his best bet at finding the right balance. There probably is scope for reducing it (by a couple of minutes, maybe), but it would be a big change and is likely way down the list (if it’s even on the list).

I'm not seeing the relevance.
More to the point, if you stick with 4M weight permanently, fees on the main chain will (assuming demand remains) explode. $50, $100, who knows? One VC tweeted that he'd happily spend $500 on opening a Lightning channel if it covered his transactions for the next x months. How are your Americans with no savings going to afford that? If you're not careful, too high fees will literally hand over control of the main chain to the 3 Americans you're talking about! V high fees is not necessarily better than v costly nodes. Need to strike some sort of balance (albeit on the left side of the scale).

Depends on the proposed use case, of course, which could be almost anything, but general benefits might include speed of final settlement (too quick for some!), offloading recordkeeping (and associated cost savings), the promise of a permanent, immutable, incorruptible record (hugely important in some use cases), being able to work with assets or value programmatically (and associated cost savings -- simply not possible with ledger entry money (i.e. fiat), for example), near real-time monitoring (though I suppose this is possible with DBs too).

This all over.  His articles are carefully crafted and this is one of many tactics he seemingly employs to downplay or rubbish Bitcoin.  I found it particularly interesting that he tried to paint Gavin A as a paid for corporate for wanting a block size increase, supposedly against the wishes of the vast majority of Bitcoin enthusiasts and active devs (this in one of his recent articles) -- a really odd take on the situation.  Almost like he is trying to subtly suggest that Bitcoin is destined to remain constrained and niche and not suitable for commercial use -- a perfect message for his target audience.

Aren't we still in the high reward, bootstrapping, looking for adopters stage?  Why are we playing around with block scarcity and fee pressure and turning away users now?  Seems like the least cautious approach.

Easy if your money is already on the exchange, because those BTC transactions are all off-chain. It’s actually withdrawing the bitcoins you buy that might be a problem.

@_date: 2015-07-09 15:15:47


There's nothing natural about the 1MB block size limit - the fee pressure now is entirely artificial, the result of core dev paralysis. Until everything is in place to deal with naturally occurring fee pressure and block scarcity - CPFP, FSS RBF, or whatever else - we really ought not to be testing it.  Once you turn people away, there's no guarantee you'll get them back.

What is serious damage to the network? A mere doubling of available capacity? You have no evidence for that.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:23:29
If everyone used it (ie if we had hard forked it in to force everyone to use it), we’d have 2.xMB blocks best case. We may never see 100% adoption, so best to reign in those expectations and accept that high fees and full blocks are the new norm. This should be a surprise to no one. All the Core-compatible eggs are in the Lightning basket, so we must wait.

The thing I read, which otherwise seems very detailed and accurate, suggests that if UTXOs are sent from  different addresses, the result is separate UTXOs in one (recipient) address. These UTXOs are then combinable in the _next_ transaction (since they don’t require separate spending scripts?), so no ever-growing UTXO set.
It doesn’t seem quite right but it isn’t something I have thought about or come across before, so makes me curious.

Revolut is doing the same thing in Europe. Consider it a baby step towards the ultimate integration of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-07 11:55:45
This is why block size increase.
Until wallet software can spot problems and auto rebroadcast transactions with the necessary fees (within user defined limits), Bitcoin simply can not cope with increased transaction volume.  That's still a far from ideal solution, but having your bitcoins tied up in unconfirmed transactions because you didn't know to set a higher than usual fee is a worse user experience.
Stress test perhaps, but there aren't that many transactions actually happening; Bitcoin is clearly hobbled by the 1MB limit.
For users looking at Bitcoin for the first time - possible given all the news lately about it being a safe haven - it appears broken and not fit for purpose.  The BIP66 / invalid block nonsense doesn't help either.

@_date: 2015-07-12 16:51:56
Odd that the attack could not be stopped then, with spam TXs auto blocked.
Not incompetent, necessarily. Might not have known to or might not have been able to (not all wallets and services were ready for bigger fees, so TXs with the default fee got stuck, as well you know). Also, this was a v cheap to carry out attack. It could have been much worse and the required fee could have been much higher.

What % of wallets support these features?  And don't miners/pools have to support them too?
Do we even want to rely on CPFP and RBF?
And how would anyone new to Bitcoin know about any of this?
I think we need to be honest and recognise that the infrastructure and the ecosystem are not sufficiently developed for this type of fee market experiment.  It's completely unnecessary and borderline reckless insofar as it threatens to discourage actual adoption.  I pity any poor Greeks who decided to give Bitcoin a shot only to find their transactions stuck because they chose the wrong wallet or didn't change the default fee.

This is where it breaks down.  Closed blockchains do not eliminate the lying/cheating problem for banks, not even close.  If anything serious happens, like a financial crisis, a closed blockchain between banks would quickly fall apart.  Legal recourse because know-your-miner?  That's the same as we have today -- and look how well that turned out during the last (current?) financial crisis.  People are still in court trying to work out Lehman.
Closed blockchains will find use cases no doubt, but one can only ignore the working, proven, super secure, global, decentralised consensus achieving network that is Bitcoin for so long -- and it certainly isn't going anywhere.

Ah, forgot about the big blocks = less people able to deal = less decentralisation argument.  It's a fair point, but query how sensitive the network really is to this.  Moore's Law has held for what, 50 years?  Agree to disagree, of course, but I think we can increase and be reasonably certain the sky will not fall.
EDIT: Heard a curious argument this this might actually improve decentralisation simply on the basis it would disrupt the 4-5 giant mining pools that currently dominate the mining landscape (i.e. in China where they have issues with broadband). Absolutely not a reason to proceed(!), just an interesting angle I hadn't heard before.
Users could effectively "vote" by running a node, right?  Assuming they increase the block size on XT, for example.  Far from ideal, I know, but I suspect someone will, eventually, force the issue.

10c is nothing to you or me but it's a prohibitively high fee in the parts of the world where Bitcoin might actually make a difference.  Africa, South America, etc.
And what if 1MB becomes a permanent feature and Bitcoin finds its place as a settlement rail for wholesale B2B or FIs? $10-20 minimum. Maybe more given the costs savings associated with near zero counterparty risk / settlement risk.  It would make large holders rich (and is probably the quickest way for them to maximise value, so keep that in mind when considering peoples' motives), but it would quickly turn everyone else away.  Then you'll have rich people saying things like, "10 dollar fees are not gonna turn anyone away."

SegWit isn't happening. It offers zero capacity increase because  (whether you agree or not) it's too _contentious_. The only thing UASF adds is _a whole host of problems_. It's only support right now seems to be among the main Core trolls; devs, exchanges and businesses aren't pushing it (the latter two being critical to any UASF effort). EDIT: I quite like this positive comment from BitPay --  -- never say never, I guess.
So why, in the meantime, when we're all just sitting here waiting for the SegWit activation deadline to pass, attack and troll anyone and everyone that puts serious work into proposing solutions other than SegWit? With BU, fine, it was a bad idea, but ext blocks? A tech that was, up until two days ago, considered a very promising way to add scale in future. A tech taken and further refined by the author of Lightning, no less. "Another attack!!" was the all too predictable response.
It's unreasonably obstructionist.
Fortunately some people are taking this seriously and giving their very thoughtful analysis and comments. This is _moving Bitcoin forward_, one way or another -- at some point there will be experimentation with ext blocks, and that's a _good thing_ (whether it solves the scaling debate is another matter, of course).
Incidentally, the ext blocks proposal can be made compatible with BIP141, with further kludgery, but it was considered cleaner to leave the main block largely untouched and move the concepts of SegWit to the ext block (and LN from there). I'm not sure that's completely unreasonable, but in any event, it being _open source code_, it can (and quite possibly will) be adapted.

To be fair, Tim has always been ~~a Buttcoiner~~ ~~anti-Bitcoin~~ *paid to write what he does*.  Most of his points are valid -- except they take Bitcoin as a finished product, when clearly it is a work in progress.
That's unfortunate, but not entirely unfair.  The truth is there are very big players in the payments and infrastructure space (think Euroclear, VISA, Cisco) who are actively researching these areas and who recognise the benefits of Bitcoin specifically but want to see it get serious and scale up.  Bitcoin is not ready for any form of mainstream.  Yet.

Increasing the block size would not be "natural"; it too would be "artificial".  Hence my confusion.
I'm fine with the "more fees = more decentralisation" argument, I just don't think 25BTC reward and &lt;3tps is where we take a stand.  I also happen to believe "more TX x min fees = more fees = more decentralisation", so not sure why you think mass adoption means less decentralisation -- wouldn't adoption also increase fee revenue?

Sigh, Bitcoin is permissionless, miners can come and go as they please. It’s currently more profitable to mine BCH. Miners switching temporarily or permanently is not a 51% attack.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:26:18
Not if those people (74% of all BCH last I read) think utility and value (and network effects) are shifting from Bitcoin to BCH. Then you HODL your BCH (or buy back in if you sold). FOMO. The upside on BCH, if it really does take value away from Bitcoin, is way bigger and, if BCH gains momentum, would be compelling.
I sold all my BCH btw. It was a reasonable price at the time but I don't mind saying I would rather be HODLing it now, just in case. Bitcoin is stuck with high fees/full blocks for at least a year or two and without 2x, businesses are likely shifting their focus. I actually see BCH as more of a threat than LTC or ETH (still not much of a threat, but never say never).
@_date: 2016-02-23 16:04:07

The purpose is to avoid a hard fork and the possibility, however unlikely, of a chain split. I get that (though I wish we weren't so scared of hard forks).
SegWit comes with enormous "added cost", FYI. The entire community has been working hard to understand, prep and implementing the required changes; wallets, processors, etc. Maybe you meant something else -- the relative cost of future upgrades, which should be made easier by SegWit, perhaps?

Right, but the proposal is a Plan B specifically for the event of SegWit on the main chain failing to activate. Compatibility wasn't important (what was important was getting those benefits into the ext block).
I am imagining it or weren't ext blocks being touted as a post-SegWit future scaling mechanism (despite previous criticisms), particularly as an argument against the SegWit + HF combo proposals? My first thought was "good on them for taking on that idea and running with it" -- it seemed very progressive/pragmatic coming from SegWit supporting devs (BitPay, bcoin, the Lightning guy). Maybe the dust would have settled more quickly if it wasn't for the ASICBOOST reveal, but unfair to throw them in that fire without trial.

There is a disagreement over how Bitcoin should scale very short term. That is all. Bitcoin businesses are merely expressing their concerns (that we are needlessly suffering a forced and premature fee market, which is making their job - primarily promoting Bitcoin to new users - much more difficult) in order to cast their "votes".
The Core dev team - almost all of whom are paid, by the way, and not just by Blockstream and its corporate investors - are doing an excellent job, save that others disagree with their opinion/advice that soft fork SegWit is better short term.
More to the point: Core devs should be writing code _for the good of Bitcoin_, not for the good of the Core project. A move to Classic would not replace the Core devs in any way, rather it would focus the the development efforts according to the will of the Bitcoin community. All the work that has gone into SegWit, weak blocks, IBLT, etc will continue and will feature in Bitcoin in future. It's just about the short term. No one is suggesting a complete change of course (or if they are hiding the fact, it will soon become apparent and the market will very quickly switch to 2M Core). 
No self-respecting Core dev would whiny ragequit _a la Hearn_ just because the market disagreed with the Core approach to short term scaling.

Wake me up when the UASF actually happens.


Right. And this _proposal_ has been made available for _public review and comment_. So again, why the hate? Go ahead and raise criticisms or objections - that's what public review and comment is all about - but whining and bitching about _the mere fact of a proposal being put together_ seems unnecessarily obstructionist. 


Joseph Poon. Who now seems to be on the hit list of the usual suspects (the weirdly militant of the Core supporters) -- all for working on a _proposal_ for a _way forward_ and presenting it for _public review and comment_. Like that's a terrible thing. Sad.

We have full blocks. 100% caused by Core's failure to grow Bitcoin and the constant delays they are responsible for, despite Gavin and numerous others raising this possibility almost a year ago.

Disagree. There are compelling incentives that work against mining centralisation beyond a certain point. Hence we see miners switch pools (where is GHash nowadays?) and miners selling their latest wares to competitors. None of that in banking (the incentives to be good - fines for the bank - are seriously weak against the incentives to do anything it takes to make money (pay and bonuses)).

What "non-Bitcoin transactions"? They all pay fees, don't they?


Don't you think 1000 TX @ .001 fee is better for "Bitcoin-the-currency" than 10 TX at .1 fee? If we reach levels of fees where online commerce using Bitcoin is prohibitively expensive, then I think Bitcoin will have failed (at least vs the original vision of an electronic cash system). Off-chain and LN can still take away a bunch of smaller, censor-resistance-and-privacy-not-so-important transactions, of course.


My understanding is people were using Bitcoin transactions for spam well before OP_RETURN -- worse, they were embedding data into addresses and challenge scripts, which was bloating the UTXO set. OP_RETURN outputs are unspendable, at least.

Important to remember Coinbase acts as a bridge between BTC and fiat. Those bridges will invariably be centralised. There's just no way around that. (Okay, maybe savvy Bitcoiners can trade among themselves, but not the millions of less tech savvy types who are curious about Bitcoin. Actually, scrap that, I am tech savvy and Coinbase's £500/day (approx. $750/day) instant purchase with credit card is very difficult to beat.)
As between users, Coinbase is _opt-in_. There need never be an "everyone accesses it through centralised services" unless, of course, direct P2P Bitcoin transactions become too expensive. In which case, we may see centralised hubs appear.

Maybe I am confused. I thought old nodes/wallets can still _receive_ SegWit TXs, they just don't know that they're SegWit and they can't properly verify the signatures (because they don't download the witness data). You can't prevent someone from sending you a SegWit TX (EDIT: "just don't give anyone a segwit address" &lt;--- this makes sense, thanks, but it doesn't address SegWit TXs further down the chain ie  coins "received" by someone via a SegWit TX before they are sent to you, which are _not properly verified by your old node_). Again, total reliance on the rest of the network to enforce SegWit (at least as regards signature validation).
Edited for clarity.

In the above, doesn't Charlie also wait for a confirm before delivering goods? Then it's a two block reorg (one from Charlie's perspective).

This is a tough one. So far, we've only seen circumstantial evidence. The latest from Jihan Wu seems to be "the ASICS are ASICBOOST capable, but ASICBOOST has never been used other than on testnet" ( Convincing or not, where does the burden of proof actually lie? Is it even provable one way or the other? Jihan Wu was pushing for the HK agreement (SegWit + HF), which would have prevented _covert_ ASICBOOST - how does that fit in with the allegation narrative? More popcorn needed. Is it possible they're _both right_? (If it is, Jihan Wu will presumably support Greg's BIP.)

I take your point but I wouldn't call it a disease. Self interest is precisely why Bitcoin works. Also, the odd empty block here or there isn't too terrible because:
- they tend to be found very quickly (since once a miner has validated the block it was working to validate, it can immediately switch to finding a valid block that includes TXs and fees)
- the empty blocks still require proof of work (i.e. Bitcoin is more secure with than without)
@_date: 2016-02-15 16:28:45




I'm not Olivier J -- I'm just a person who took an interest in Bitcoin back in 2013 and haven't been able to let go since.


Absolutely. And they will: Classic won't trigger without them (or at least without the hashrate).


Fair point, and I have some sympathy, but in this instance hashrate matters. If they are not miners, they need to (somehow) make their views known to miners.


I will let the market speak for itself (which it will, one way or another). I hold a very small number of bitcoins and, for what it's worth, I believe Bitcoin will be just fine either way (SegWit first or hard fork first). I lean towards the latter, but I'm still exploring the debate (and learning things all the time).


I don't think the sky will fall -- 1,000 blocks plus 28 days does not seem unreasonable to me, given the sheer length of this debate and the obvious focus on it, but this is now for the miners to decide.


I'm almost certainly not as invested as Olivier J, but I do have an interest. I could be wrong but I don't think Bitcoin development will suffer unreasonably as a result of a switch to 2M (if that switch happens). I would find it difficult to sympathise with a dev that chooses to walk away completely from Bitcoin _just because the market chose not to follow their advice_ on a particular point. 


Agree the human drama is not helpful (abhorrent, in some cases), but I do think Bitcoin will progress and be stronger for it. The fact this is all being debated in public, with all interested parties involved, is quite remarkable.


I greatly respect all Bitcoin devs, particularly the active Core devs who work tirelessly to support and grow Bitcoin. However, I don't see any one of them (or any particular project, or indeed all devs collectively) as sole decision maker. BIPs in respect of a particular project only represent one view.
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:43:25
Sometimes businesses or services just increase capacity. That's how the world works.
Miners will do the same, if and when they determine they are leaving too many fees on the table (or too many people start moving to eg Zcash).

I can't remember the last time I paid a _not insignificant fee_ in order to spend money. (The only example I can think of is when I last sent money across a border, which was expensive, but has nothing to do with retail.)
My guess is a $15 fee would eliminate 90% of Bitcoin TXs today. Maybe more. Why would anyone use Bitcoin to spend money at $15 a time?
Silk Road would open up to other alts - many of them much more privacy focused - and users would save $14.99 per transaction just by using them.
OpenBazaar and just about every other Bitcoin service or Bitcoin accepting merchant would have vastly fewer cryptocurrency users unless they "upgraded" to accept whatever alts inherit Bitcoin's network effects.
I'm not saying the sky is falling - Bitcoin will be fine (and still cheap) SegWit first or 2M hard fork first - but the _long term plan_ for Bitcoin as a high value, high cost settlement system is worrying, and very far removed from the original vision, in my opinion.

Erm, there is fee pressure **now** and Bitcoin + SegWit **does not allow for the type of TX volume growth we saw through 2015**, let alone any uptick we might hope for. SegWit is great for a number of reasons - and it does help a little with capacity, but it is not capacity solution.
@_date: 2016-02-01 17:30:19
No one knows, which is why it is risky -- and the timing coincides perfectly with the halving in July (all sorts of unknowns there, but very likely big increases in TX volume). I suppose the worst case is high (and very unpredictable) fees, lots of stuck TXs as a result (wallets and other services paying/recommending the wrong fees), ever increasing mempools, crashing nodes, horrible UI all round and lots of people complaining about a system that was supposed to be fast and nearly fee.
Only yesterday I caught a Bitcoin curious friend telling another how Bitcoin TXs take "four hours to move across and sometimes get stuck" -- and he's relatively knowledgeable about Bitcoin (compared to my other friends at least). These impressions stick.

Ext blocks has been around as a concept for _years_, long before SegWit SF and ASICBOOST.

Are sidechains even a thing yet? Are there designs where the security issues have been solved? Genuine question-- I may be a bit behind, but I thought they were even further away than Lightning. I also wonder what the impact of Lightning enabled atomic swaps between Bitcoin and alts will be (alts effectively competing with sidechains on a security and cost basis).
@_date: 2015-07-08 23:22:34
Maybe if this was a well funded project from day 1, being worked on fulltime by well paid devs, I'd agree, but this was the hobby of a handful of people for the first year or two and the work of mostly volunteers since ( and with alts and Bitcoin 2.0 projects undoubtedly taking away precious resources). The level of development and innovation is pretty remarkable all things considered. Or maybe I am being too kind.

Did any of those "snide attacks" come _with or before_ the announcement or response to the announcement? Honest question, because I might have missed something and it's super important to get the timeline (and context) right (given people's apparent willingness to trash the reputations of others).
The first I heard of the _prosposal_ was Samson Mow's pre-announcement fake news tweet, proclaiming that bcoin had been paid off by Jihan Wu to help secretly _deploy_ SF ext blocks, submitted (of course) with no evidence, and quickly propagated by a seething army of Core trolls.
Everything else I have seen from the ext block side has been post announcement defending of reputations (and again since the ASICBOOST reveal and corresponding accusations (provided, as before, with only circumstantial evidence _and_ propagated notwithstanding denials and corrections).
Objectively, did something else happen? What did I miss?

Activating SegWit _isn't happening_. That's where the advantage comes in: getting SegWit done vs not getting it done. (People can hold out for SegWit-only but it could take years or it might not happen at all or there might be a UASF chain split to get it -- personally I see those scenarios as _riskier_ than all sides working together).


Agree, and it's very encouraging, but there's no point pretending SegWit brings 2M right away -- it will take time and it's necessarily unpredictable. Most people seem to think years rather than weeks or months (though there'll be other SegWit enabled advancements kicking in too, of course, like Schnoor.)

@_date: 2016-02-12 11:22:27
Disagree. Absent a change in the PoW algo, one branch will survive, the other will not. The split is temporary, and ultimately, the resulting bitcoins are the only bitcoins, being exactly the same bitcoins that existed before the split, each with its own rich history going all the way back to the genesis block.
This is a weird FUD/scare piece, paid for and perfectly timed, of course.
@_date: 2017-04-06 11:30:05
You know what else would explain [the EB proposal's] SegWit incompatibility? The assumption that SegWit would not activate _for whatever reason_.
Even the staunchest of SegWit supporters were starting to think SegWit would not activate -- all without any knowledge of the possibility of covert ASICBOOST use. Why assume the bcoin devs had prior knowledge?
Seems like an unnecessarily toxic response to assume bad faith.

This may bite you in the bum when those same signatories turn around and demand a 2M hard fork in a month or two. Re-read the letter -- it's super non-committal. It basically does exactly what Roger Ver said a week or two ago (or was it Erik Voorhees?): Core should give a clear timeline and commit to a hard fork post SegWit. That's not going to happen, of course, and Classic will be sitting there waiting for its 75% threshold to be met.
From the letter:


^ Literally an ultimatum for Core.
Not sure why you assume bad faith on Classic's part. The individuals involved have been professional throughout. There have been public statements of support for Classic specifically from parties who now seem to want to give Core a chance to change its approach -- that's not necessarily inconsistent, and it certainly doesn't mean Classic has been dishonest.

Bitcoin isn't free, and this was true before full blocks. A perfectly natural fee market was already developing. Free TXs haven't been possible for a long while.
In any event, we're still in the bootstrap phase, the whole point of which was to grow Bitcoin's on chain capacity while keeping fees to a minimum. More TXs at lower fees being preferable to fewer TXs at higher fees. Core missed the mark, badly. We now get a month minimum of full blocks, bloated mempools, unpredictable fees, stuck transactions and whatnot. A pretty crappy experience for anyone new to Bitcoin, and absolutely, completely unnecessary. People warned of this a year ago.

Economic majority refers to the users and Bitcoin businesses that give bitcoins value. In an ideal world, miners would implement changes based primarily on their votes, since without them bitcoins would have no value. This isn't an ideal world, so we have the current situation: some huge Bitcoin businesses, representing more users than anyone else, trying to make their voices heard and effectively being ignored (mocked and attacked, even). It's all a bit odd. That a few Core devs and miners can declare consensus - and specifically, the failure of miners to negotiate a limit bump before mid 2017 - is embarrassing.
Don't get me wrong, SegWit first is okay, I don't think the sky is falling, but Bitcoin is a long way removed from what I think a lot of people imagined.
The direct result of this is that for the first time ever, Bitcoin will not be able to grow as fast as it has in previous years. Even with SegWit, there will not be enough room. Mainstream, ha, no chance.
@_date: 2016-02-16 21:27:11

EB contributor mentioning changing EB to make it compatible with SegWit on the main chain **before** Greg's ASICBOOST reveal.
The onus is on Greg, Peter and Luke to prove their wild accusations (Greg backed down on the public mailing list, calling it a "glib comment", but of course the damage was done -- and he can rely on people like you to propagate the fake news).
Put ASICBOOST to one side just for a second. Rewind a day or two. SegWit was showing _no signs of activating_ period. It was not happening. Even Luke-Jr was calling it "contentious". Various HF plans were being proposed, but of course there's zero appetite for hard forks now. Then several _vocal SegWit supporters_ with significant credentials (BitPay, Lightning creator, bcoin) reveal a SF(!) proposal built based on the interesting ext block work by J Lau and Adam Back, and with some SegWit fixes (TX mal etc) bundled in. What's not to like? Oh wait, the way it was announced. And that it breaks SegWit on the main chain (even though _there being no main chain SegWit_ was kinda the motivation behind the proposal in the first place).
Or just go ahead and assume the worst (and pretend that Greg's glib comment and the accusations made by Peter T and Luke-Jr aren't just more of the same toxic nonsense aimed at anything non-Core/SegWit. Insist that Jihan Wu owns literally everyone in the community except Core, theymos and a few redditors, and that people like Stephen Pair and Joseph Poon and the bcoin team are in his pocket, paid off/corrupt/out to destroy Bitcoin.

Maybe people want an instant capacity increase, even if only a can-kick, which SegWit does not provide, and they don't see SegWit (and the advantages it brings) as the priority; getting those people onboard with SegWit by applying a conservative upgrade to the base block size does not seem totally unreasonable.

Maybe the sentence is ambiguous, but it reads to me (and the miners have since said as much) that they want HF code _in a release of Core_ before they run SegWit in production. Clearly we are a million miles away from HF code _in a release of Core_, so why would they signal/activate SegWit? They basically want S Lerner's SegWit2M (or SegWit8M if you prefer).

Same can be said for almost everyone involved.

Maybe it doesn't matter in this instance because they're unlikely to take any serious action.
@_date: 2016-02-04 15:49:51


It's the _price_ of bitcoins that is all important in this context. That does not mean Blockstream employees necessarily want Bitcoin to _grow_, rather they are incentivised to make bitcoins _cost more_. They might well see a low volume, high fee, bank settlement system as the easiest way of achieving that. (I'm not saying they do; I'm just pointing out that time-locked bitcoins as part of their comp package does not mean they will automatically adhere to Satoshi's original vision for Bitcoin.)
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:25:32
Yes and no.
It's pointless miners mining blocks that no one wants (i.e. that nodes reject), so nodes have the final say in that sense (specifically, a subset of nodes, being the nodes that Bitcoiners actually use -- the most important arguably being the exchanges). Miners still effect the actual change, of course.
If there was a bona fide split of the network - 50/50 hashrate - and all nodes supported one side over the other, that side would win. It's blocks would propagate much more quickly, and that side's chain would be the longest valid chain.
@_date: 2016-02-10 22:33:46
Does not explain pools (analogy falls apart because smaller miners can still mine, they just join bigger pools).
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:27:08
bcoin doesn't, the ext block proposal does. But the proposal is an _alternative_ to SegWit on the main chain, so no need to take care not to break it. Just to be clear/fair.

All good points, but none of them justify calling the proposal "hostile" or an "attack".
@_date: 2017-04-04 13:11:47
Old nodes have no choice but to accept SegWit TXs (they can't "never accept segwit transactions"). They are tricked into accepting them. They do not properly verify the signatures, rather they rely on the rest of the network to check sigs. How is that not a downgrade? More to the point, how is it any different to the ext blocks proposal (which you says _does_ downgrade your (old) full node)?

9 of whom were at the roundtable anyway. ;)
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:16:48
This is true, but Satoshi was aiming for:
(1) a *large* number of *low fee* TXs
rather than:
(2) a *small* number of *high fee* TXs
Core seems to have decided that we should all aim for (2).
I would also add that a fee market had, in fact, been developing, before full blocks became an issue. It has long been the case that fees very roughly determine processing time. The block size limit - a simple production quota - is not necessary.
@_date: 2016-02-18 21:22:34
The block it builds upon is a valid block, with a valid header, the miner just hasn't had time to check each TX within that block i.e. in order to add new, potentially dependent TXs to its empty block.
Even if propagation and validation were super quick, say 5 seconds, it would still make sense to try for any empty block in those 5 seconds.
@_date: 2016-02-27 21:05:57
Huh? Isn't he referring to the post SW hard fork that Core must now incorporate? Or is the roundtable plan not agreed? Has Core updated its roadmap?
@_date: 2016-02-23 10:41:31
At some point the block size limit needs to increase/go. That can only be done with a hard fork. A hard fork necessarily means a change without the user explicitly authorising it. It is what it is.

Possibly not but ramping up will help immensely.


It will become a high cost, high value settlement layer. Today's Bitcoiners (and tomorrow's potential adopters) will be replaced with banks, corporates and governments. Centralise all the things!

Did you miss the 3 week ultimatum in the letter? The one asking Core devs to do what they have been refusing to do for months? Sadly, this may drag on.
@_date: 2017-04-19 15:06:07
I don't agree but Core (and I include old Core devs like Gavin A, Jeff G, Mike H here) was simply not able to bring the community together on any scaling improvements despite _years of discussion_. Now we have a (more often than not) heavily congested, expensive network -- yet no technical reasons for not already having bigger blocks. A can-kick to 2M planned a year or two ago would have prevented much of this. Instead, some argued 2M was too little and others argued 2M was the edge of an unavoidably slippery slope. In that narrow sense, Core (collectively) absolutely failed. In the end, the only option they provided (i.e. merged in Core) was something no one had actually been asking for. It promised 4M blocks but only a 0.7M effective increase. Further, it required 95% miner buy-in despite miners _asking for something much simpler. Benefit of the doubt: rightly or wrongly, that is what he meant by "incompetent". Again, I don't agree. :)
@_date: 2016-02-23 00:44:39
What SegWit changes make hard forks safer (that aren't already addressed by Classic)?
@_date: 2016-02-07 15:43:55
Sometimes the obvious answer is the correct one: the majority of miners and Bitcoin businesses actually want 2MB. They don't need to be "paid off" to "attack" the network.
@_date: 2016-02-15 13:53:15
It would be nice to fix the node-doesn't-get-paid problem -- a cut of the fees payable to nodes from O_RETURN TXs, for example, but probably too easy to game.
Agree node operators receive nothing but they do stand to benefit insofar as they validate their own Bitcoin transactions. So we can reasonably expect Bitcoin businesses to operate nodes regardless. Assuming they do - or enough of them do - there should be sufficient levels of decentralisation in terms of node count (indeed, some people argue that non-economic full nodes - those run by enthusiast for no reason other than checking and relaying transactions and blocks - really aren't important).


But who are those people and how high are those fees? If we shoot for a bona fide settlement system, with permanently limited capacity, fees could be $10 or more. Still competitive for big govs, banks and corps, not so much for average Joe wanting to spend his pay check. I take your point but I did say "_Bitcoin will have failed (at least vs the original vision of an electronic cash system)_", not that Bitcoin will have failed completely.
Put it this way (worst case): imagine you know nothing of Bitcoin. In 10 years' time, you hear about all the potential it once had - censor resistance, relative privacy, etc. Then you learn that each TX now costs $15, that it is used almost exclusively by govs, banks and mega corps and, because it is used almost exclusively by govs, banks and mega corps, miners were compromised some time ago. You only get to use Bitcoin via an authorised LN hub that requires full KYC. Great.

Tough break. Have you spoken to Leanne about this? Who did she team up with to get Everledger off the ground? Did you guys discuss working together on making the hackathon project a commercial reality? From what you say, she will have needed technical help from someone -- who did she hook up with?
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:22:19


Satoshi foresaw this. Besides, it really just means lots of companies in many jurisdictions all around the world running nodes, privately and in datacenters (gigabit won't be impressive in x years, btw), and all but the most hardcore of users using SPV. That's way better than a compromised main chain.


Why would anyone pay those kinds of fees when they just as easily use Zcash (or whatever alt or alts inherit Bitcoin's network effects) for a fraction of the price?

@_date: 2017-04-14 07:01:21
Silly to suggest this is just a few pool ops. Miners can change pools. No, it's a majority of miners and, dare I say it, some users. Not accepting that and insisting on forcing SegWit through (eg via UASF) is to declare Bitcoin a democracy and force your views on a minority. The arguments against hard forks that brought us here in the first place are suddenly not important.
@_date: 2016-02-29 12:25:59
This is well understood - it is the way we have been doing things for quite some time. Core knew this too, but nevertheless rejected the idea of actually lifting the hard limit despite this very obvious fact.
The reasons (given by Core, or rather the most influential of Core developers) are now becoming clear...
They want full blocks and high fees. Full stop.
@_date: 2016-02-09 07:47:33

You have to go another layer deeper, and wear two tinfoil hats.
**They don't want SegWit activated.**
@_date: 2017-04-05 17:15:40
I should not have said SegWit _will not activate_. I think it's unlikely in the extreme, such that we should be thinking about Plans B, C and D while we wait. But you're right, SegWit might actually activate.
Now take a step back and consider why you are so committed to the idea of SegWit activating -- to the extent you refuse to consider any alternative future. You seem to think SegWit SF is not contentious when even its creator, Luke-Jr, says it is!
Honestly, I don't believe Jihan Wu's threats of forking with a miner majority, not for a second. Posturing and bluster. I do, however, believe you would push a poorly supported UASF that virtually guarantees a chain split. I'm more worried about you than him. :)
FWIW, if there is overwhelming support for a UASF in the very short timescale required (1 Aug?), my node will support it (and I think the miners would ultimately accept) -- I'm just deeply sceptical, that is all.
@_date: 2016-02-23 23:03:28
Which bits differ, and how?
@_date: 2017-04-04 11:16:08
Old nodes don't "opt in" to soft forks (miner or user activated), but they necessarily feel the effects (ie they're no longer able to properly verify the new transactions). True for EB TXs and true for SegWit TXs.
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:58:36
i.e. the raison d'être of the proposal is that SegWit on the main chain is DAO and not going to happen. That's literally why the proposal was put together.
@_date: 2016-02-26 11:23:52
Most likely scenario - in the _extremely unlikely scenario that the minority 1M branch continues to exist long enough for people to withdraw the coins_ - Coinbase will simply say, "you now have these 1M minority coins in addition to your bitcoins -- please withdraw them within the next 28 days".
Any other approach would open them up to lawsuits.
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:12:46
You keep calling it "lobbying", why not "consulting with" or "asking for opinions"? There were no signed commitment letters here, just some devs working together on an idea and sounding a few people out. Granted, in the current climate that did not go down well.


It does include SegWit's benefits (in the ext block). It does not include SegWit on the main chain because it is based (quite reasonably) on the assumption that SegWit on the main chain is DOA. That does not mean they knew anything about the possibility of some covert ASICBOOST.
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:49:06
The two are wildly different and not mutually exclusive (and we have no choice but to sit and wait for SegWit anyway, which still might not happen); "a waste of time for everybody" seems like an odd conclusion. Thankfully, others have been more pragmatic and have already provided thoughtful analysis and comment.

It's all about the "layers": 


Hmm, I assumed you did. Satoshi didn't state it anywhere, or include a comment in the code, but it is well known and understood by the people involved at the time:
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:44:53
If we aim for (2), Bitcoin will become the preserve of the banks and corporates and 1% that can afford to use the main chain as a settlement layer. It's difficult to imagine anything more centralised.
@_date: 2017-04-14 08:39:25
Yup, kudos GM
@_date: 2017-04-01 08:53:07
sw2mb has two very important advantages:
(1) it gets SegWit done
(2) it introduces, immediately, double the block space (the additional capacity realised through SegWit will take time).
The downside is a hard fork, but IMO we should dispense with the HF fuddery too. With sufficient lead time and Core's support, HFs can be done safely and reasonably quickly.
Would I rather just get SegWit done, now? Yes. So would the proposer of sw2mb. But it's not happening. Would I rather have the status quo or nothing? No. Would I rather chain split through UASF? Nope. Just IMO.

@_date: 2017-04-01 11:02:30
So arguing for an immediate block size increase is now _a political process_? Since when were proposals and BIPs submitted for comment _political_? Political because this proposal was not submitted by a prominent Core dev, or political because it is not perfectly inline with GMax's Core roadmap email?
Calling every such proposal political kinda makes it political.
@_date: 2017-04-04 11:46:17
Not _reject_ the block as being too large, just _ignore_ the extension (in the same way they would ignore a SegWit extension i.e. the witness data). It's just another hack to trick old nodes into thinking that everything is hunky-dory -- purely to maintain backwards compatibility.
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:23:25
bcoin doesn't, the new proposal does (but it's based on the assumption that SegWit on the main chain is a no go anway -- it's literally an _alternative_ to SegWit on the main chain, a Plan B. Why take extra care not to break SegWit on the main chain?).
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:47:26

@_date: 2016-02-15 11:37:06
This is absurd.
Coinbase is **opt-in**. It has done as much if not more than just about anyone or anything else to promote Bitcoin adoption and ease of use. In fact, it wants _more people to use Bitcoin_, hence its support for _bigger blocks_. In any event, Coinbase can in no way prevent LN development, deployment or use.
It's really, really simple: Bitcoin _is_ the software its users choose to run. Miners are a conservative bunch, because their business and livelihoods depend it, so if 75% of miners think the move to 2M is so important they are willing to rock the boat to get it, then maybe _they are right_ and _keeping the status quo_ is the contentious argument.
@_date: 2016-02-28 21:19:39
Yawn. No one is arguing that the Core devs don't do great work. My only point, which you keep ignoring, was that we have full blocks and Core could have - and should have - prevented this.
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:41:49
Miners are kind of important. Hence we've seen Core devs fly out there, Classic devs fly out there, Unlimited devs fly out there, yada, yada. For something like this, a soft fork alternative to the hard fork miners seem to want, it makes sense to go out there and assess whether your idea is DOA on not.

You're right, of course, but I think the idea is that miners announce their empty block only once they complete the validation of the previous block.
Agree that building on top of invalid blocks is bad (and has proved to be an expensive lesson for the relevant miners where there has been a subsequent chain re-org -- or maybe some miners take their chances and see a re-org as a cost of business?).
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:00:00
They didn't offer a _perfect solution_, they offered a _proposal to the community_ for _review and testing_. It seems really odd to assume bad faith, but maybe I'm missing the nuance. I put it down to Samson Mow's initial fake news tweet and the immediate follow-ups by the usual Core troll suspects, declaring that (1) EBs had already been secretly deployed and (2) the bcoin team received funds from Bitmain for that purpose. Predictably toxic response. I'm not convinced the response would have been different had the proposal been formatted as a BIP and submitted to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. Look how the other non-SegWit proposals have been treated.
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:43:14


They have said it, repeatedly. They want Bitcoin to be the settlement layer for LN and side chains. That's not a secret and that's why we're stuck at 1M.


Core was pressured to act -- and they managed to give the absolute bare minimum, being a bump to 1.7M via SegWit _if all wallets adopt it_.
It's very, very clear that Core - or at least the most influential Core devs - want to keep 1M to force fees up.


You know full well it was an historic DoS limit, not (and never intended to be) a policy tool. No one could have imagined the limit would be quite so hard to remove:

Yes, everyone behind the proposal is pro-SegWit. The proposal assumes SegWit won't activate -- it's very clearly a Plan B. I've amended my post for clarity.
@_date: 2016-02-24 19:21:19


Possibly not, but the answer is not to stay at 1MB. That's hobbling Bitcoin, causing growth retardation, unnecessarily.


SegWit has a capacity benefit, but it is not a capacity fix, in any way, shape or form. LN is not finished and in any event it looks anything but decentralised.
Something else to consider (since "decentralisation" is not the primary argument of Core, and it makes no sense anyway given the now planned block size increase): small block proponents keep telling us blocks are _not full_, yet we very clearly have increased fee requirements to process TXs. So which is it, the block size limit is necessary to force a fee "market" or miners are perfectly capable of participating in a natural fee market regardless? (I would say the latter.)
Should be an interesting year.
@_date: 2016-02-23 23:05:08


It's very odd. The above suggests some weird face-off between miners and Core, which makes no sense, given the alternative options for miners.
@_date: 2017-04-05 09:00:09
For perspective, rightly or wrongly I think the "other side" sees this: we wait for SegWit, we then wait to see if SegWit provides any genuine capacity increase (it will be delivered slowly rather than immediately and it is simply not guaranteed -- 2M could take years or never happen), when we know SegWit is exhausted in that regard, only then do we consider alternative solutions (and even then, SegWit's potential for oversized witness extension blocks may limit some of those alternative solutions). There's a possibility of _years_ with only nominal capacity increases and no decrease in fees, with absolutely no Plan B in place.
Not that any other solutions stand to be implemented any time soon, but still. That seems to be the main concern.
@_date: 2016-02-15 11:54:58


This makes no sense.
 


This is inherent in Bitcoin's design. It is how Bitcoin works. The incentives are properly aligned and very, very strong. Miners (being a very conservative bunch) ultimately reflect the will of the economic majority. They listen to Bitcoin businesses and exchanges because _that's how and where they sell their coins_. This is all about self-interest, which is absolutely critical to Bitcoin.


Proof of work and the brilliance of Nakamoto consensus are not just about mathematical certainties -- equally important are the sufficiently strong and properly aligned incentives. Those incentives have little to do with cryptography or maths and everything to do with "market magic".

Isn't the proposer the Rootstock guy, Sergio L, who wants (needs, actually) SegWit but can't see a way of getting SegWit any time soon? The choice, according to him, is clear: get SegWit done, with a small bump to the base block size (non-witness, the ones that old nodes will see) or wait potentially years for SegWit (and watch other cryptos move ahead). Not an unreasonable position from a SegWit supporter.
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:10:27
LN doesn't yet exist, so be careful making bold proclamations. Yes they are Bitcoin TXs, no that doesn't mean they can't be blocked. I am very hopeful (believe it or not -- I think there are lots of great use cases for it), but I do not want to see main chain TXs needlessly limited simply to feed LN.
If you follow the _Bitcoin as a high cost, high value settlement layer_ logic to its natural conclusion, you get to a place where:
- the vast majority of main chain TXs are banks/corporates/governments
- those banks/corporates/governments necessarily exert undue influence over the miners
- miners might be encouraged to block TXs from LN hubs that aren't controlled by those same those banks/corporates/governments or aren't otherwise AML/KYC registered

I know Greg calls Adam, Peter T, Luke-Hr, thebluematt, etc "politically naive" (among other things) but I thought they did Greg and the small block crowd a huge favour stopping Classic in its tracks.

No, the fee market was developing naturally until it came up against _something that was never intended to be a production quota_. In fact, it is no longer a fee "market" at all. Sure, there's new found competition among TXs for block space, but that is entirely different. Miners are now not able to adjust their limits and price TXs as they see fit. (Or they could if they collectively had some balls, but you know what I mean.) 
Your suggestions are noted.

Coinbase is a big exchange -- it (and its nodes) arguably represent a not insignificant part of the economic majority (i.e. miners will give weight to the views of exchanges because that's where the demand comes from for the bitcoins they mine).
@_date: 2016-02-22 08:37:59
The only disagreement is **when** the block size limit should increase.
They want to do it now because it's better for their respective businesses (bringing new buyers and businesses in). Climbing and often unpredictable fees and delayed transactions are things Bitcoin users need not be suffering at this stage in Bitcoin's development.
In short, they only get massively rich when Bitcoin becomes massively more popular.
Businesses should have a say in how Bitcoin develops. This is them voicing their opinion/casting their vote, nothing more than that.
@_date: 2016-02-12 12:28:48
All good points, save that I think 90% is too high (if mining were more decentralised, or we could be sure there would be less inertia in terms of individual miners within pools casting their votes i.e. by moving to other pools, it might not be).
Critical to Bitcoin's long term prospects are its network effects. They got us this far. I see alts doing really interesting things, and I can't help but think that if vetos consistently prevent those and other important improvements making their way into Bitcoin, well, Bitcoin stagnates and we start to lose those all-important network effects to other projects. Example: everyone drops their objection to Core's SegWit first plan but for one militant pro-2M hard fork miner who happens to have &gt;10% hashrate. Surely we should be more pragmatic in these circumstances and lower the threshold?
Fortunately, we're in a reasonably good position insofar as there are no obviously dominant miners or pools (I'm thinking back to when GHash consistently maintained &gt;40% hashrate) -- so the "magic number" (i.e. to prevent one miner/pool veto risk) need not be too low. Sure, I'd rather mining be more decentralised, and the "magic number" be 90-95%, but it's not, so it can't be. 75% is reasonable. It's a strong majority and two big miners/pools can still veto.

This is in line with growth over the last year. That's an awfully long time, and a lot of TX fees, for someone to be "spamming the network in constant and devious ways".

The mempool usually clears over the weekend. When it doesn't, and blocks are still 1M, this is what happens. We have another month absolute minimum before the SegWit bump (assuming that's the way things go).

That's only if enormous transactions are allowed (and purposefully created). Add a rule to limit the max size of a TX  and there's no such problem (ie a temporary fix until the issue is properly addressed).

And Moore's Law-like development of the relevant tech will also help provide (vastly bigger bandwidth, cheaper storage).
@_date: 2016-02-03 11:22:55
Because we shouldn't be testing the edges like that (ie letting fees reach new highs, forcing TXs out and making people look elsewhere) -- there's just no need to do that at this point in Bitcoin's development. We certainly don't want to risk a sudden and mass migration to an alt (given the flap over getting this simple HF done, I wouldn't bet on us being able to react quickly to people leaving -- testing the edges in this way would require multiple hard forks each year and, of course, someone to make the decisions as to when and how much).
Keep a hard limit, if you must, but it should be well above the average mempool size. Miners can continue to use soft limits instead, surely preferable to regular hard increases.
The halving in July adds all sorts of unknowns too -- and we big spikes in TX volume.

It does read like a negotiation (which the miners evidently weren't very good at) rather than collaboration.
Can only blame the miners for the result though. Core has at least been consistent in its approach, assuming Core actually update their roadmap to reflect this "consensus".

I think they are the same people. July 2017 is essentially a full year of delay. So-called big blockers want 2M sooner, that is all.

The only thing that matters is Classic and its 75% activation threshold. This letter might well indicate that certain people will not mine Classic blocks... Or it might not. People seem to be flip-flopping on this issue and the language in the letter is non-committal -- they want clarity on timing for SegWit and future hard forks. If they don't like what they see, Classic is there waiting.
Miners will decide this (to be distinguished from pool admins) and this might not be "resolved" for months.

Unfortunately, there will never be 100% agreement. We see this with every upgrade. Someone, somewhere, will disagree. They can refuse to upgrade - they have the option of fighting to keep the highly contentious 1M branch alive - but Bitcoin will move on. Such is life.
Conversely, 26% of the hashrate could prevent the increase to 2M. A mere 26%.
I suppose if an unreasonable Classic-minded miner with 10% hashrate decided to block SegWit, you'd be fine with that, right?
@_date: 2017-04-24 08:08:05
70% of the hash rate is using ASICBoost? Are you sure they think it's advantageous?

Putting aside for a second the question of whether F2Pool broke the agreement _for everyone_ when they signalled a Classic block that one time, you can't possibly think that the Core devs present at the meeting, and Adam Back, did their bit. There was virtually zero effort to work in public on a post SegWit HF, nor get code into a release of Core; the best they managed was Luke-Jr whipping up a last minute recommended block size **decrease** not at all in the spirit of the agreement.
I'm not saying Core should have included HF code in a release by now, but that was (seemingly) a condition for running SegWit code. Maybe there is some other reason 70% of the hash rate is not signalling SegWit, but you have to be honest and recognise that they (the miners) have been pretty consistent with their message -- they wanted SegWit+2MHF.

It's a good article but important to realise/acknowledge that it could have been written to imply, just as effectively, the complete opposite (i.e. that the bad guys want SegWit first).

Whatever, this is getting really old. We're all over it. Release the final and let's get on with it. Classic will sit there and wait (I think it dies in 2018, if not activated?). If miners want 2MB, and Core doesn't give it, there's the option. Use classic or patch your own software.

It's not just about coffee! It's virtually all online commerce too. You know, things like buying stuff from Overstock or Amazon. Those sorts of things could become prohibitively expensive to do on-chain, using bitcoins, if Bitcoin becomes a relatively high cost settlement network (effectively the preserve of big corps and banks).
Lightning Network needs much more work before we draw a line and determine that's the way Bitcoin should go. (And query how e.g. private payments channels can remain open and available if the Bitcoin blockchain proper is effectively controlled by the big corps and banks that get to use it -- is there a risk that they (and the governments that control them) will ultimately have the say in which payment channels are opened and/or closed?)

Short term speculative profit perhaps, but miners might actually be more concerned about the long term (loss of long term profit due to fees moving off chain eg to LN and SegWit making bona fide block size increases more difficult). I'm guessing, obvs, because we don't know the real motives of the 70% or so of the hash rate that isn't signalling. It sure as heck isn't because Jihan/Ver -- there's obvs something more to it.

It wasn't BIP ready and not everything is announced to the mailing list first (esp where the _concepts_ (in this case, ext blocks) have already been discussed). They took an idea and ran with it and pushed out a draft spec and code for public review and testing. A Plan B to break the impasse in the event SegWit failed to activate. I see it more like e.g. Blockchain's Thunder announcement. Evidently it has upset a few people but I still see no reason to vilify or assume bad faith. Ah well, not unusual for Bitcoin nowadays.

So lobby the devs to change the code so empty blocks are not possible.
The econ majority can then pressure miners to accept the change.
@_date: 2016-02-23 10:46:23


I actually think the assumption was that _miners and Bitcoin businesses wanted the change_. It was a fair assumption to make given that miners and Bitcoin businesses said as much over the course of 2015. Miners have since been convinced that SegWit first is fine and here we are.
Not sure why people keep attacking Gavin or anyone else for offering alternative implementations to the Bitcoin community. Prior to the SegWit first idea, which was only revealed in December(!), Core had simply refused to implement code to increase the limit. It was starting to look at lot like an unreasonable position.

Agree, but I do recall someone saying (on a podcast, a long time ago, not very helpful I know) that data showed Satoshi might have been a bit too conservative in choosing 10 minutes -- that the time between blocks could be reduced to ~6 minutes before we see orphan issues and a reduction in security. That would be a 40% increase, with acceptable network load. Not sure if this has been discussed since, but something for the future, perhaps (an _every little helps_ type change). 
@_date: 2017-04-04 10:08:07
People are trying to _move Bitcoin forward_. Convincing all miners to activate SegWit _is not working_, just as convincing all users to accept a HF option _is not working_. This EB proposal brings something new to the table. It was put together by one of the main guys behind Lightning. Why all the hate? 
@_date: 2016-02-29 19:10:00
What would be the point? Your transactions would not be censor resistant. You would be much better off using an alt coin that isn't controlled by banks, corporates and governments.
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:52:31
Right, so the question becomes _should miners be forced to upgrade their software to support SegWit_? That seemingly requires a monumental UASF effort. So let's see if the econ majority _really is sufficiently motivated_ to get SegWit done. Or could it be that SegWit is contentious to some degree _beyond just miners_?
I don't think anyone knows the answer for sure, so I can't blame devs for working hard on alternative solutions in the meantime. (I gather ext blocks has already been made ASICBOOST resistant and will be made SegWit-on-the-main-chain compatible, so I guess the conversation has already moved on somewhat.)
@_date: 2017-04-06 18:11:31
The Q is was Bitmain using ASICBOOST covertly on main net. The patent issue is probably not important (evidence points to Bitmain holding a patent in China anyway). Jihan Wu denies it, and it might not be possible to prove one way or the other (doesn't seem to have been proven yet). In fact, they might both be right (GMax correctly identifying that Bitmain _could_ use covert ASICBOOST, Jihan Wu claiming that Bitmain _have never_ used ASICBOOST on main net). Right back to square one (except perhaps more likely to quickly implement GMax's BIP).
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:22:48
This can't be right. There were at least some experts at the Satoshi Roandtable this weekend insisting blocks are only ~40% full.

@_date: 2016-02-29 13:15:23
In theory, the miners would simply realise they're missing out on good fees and simply increase the block size themselves.
The problem with that: how quickly can the miners act? Because _not increasing the block size_ means TXs are necessarily being pushed elsewhere (i.e. some people will decide not to transact at all, whereas others will use fiat or alts). How do you measure the number of people who use alts? How do you know how close you are to _sudden and mass migration away from Bitcoin_? Tough questions.
The unfortunate thing about all this: a natural fee market was developing long before full blocks.

Probably fair, but I might draw a distinction between _lobbying for the uptake of a solution_ (or the rejection of a solution) and _trying to assess whether your idea would be DOA_. Compare and contrast to the infamous HK agreement -- that was lobbying done properly! ;)


Still irrelevant to the proposal (which assumes SegWit to be DOA). Pretty sure Andrew Lee, Stephen Pair, Joseph Poon, etc would rather have SegWit up and running by now.


Indeed. Now we (probably) know why Jihan Wu/Bitmain liked this particular SF. Still waiting for Bitmain's response...

@_date: 2016-02-12 11:30:02


Not quite sure what you mean here, but I'm going to disagree anyway.
Bitcoin is still very heavily subsidised -- it is in the bootstrap phase and this is exactly the time to be building it out and improving it. Let it grow. Allowing one large miner or a pool admin to veto a change because he thinks, "well, I'm making some money now, and these people don't want the change to happen and they're paying me too, so sure, I'll veto it" - whether it be the hard fork bump to 2M or the soft fork SegWit - would be tragic.

@_date: 2016-02-15 14:50:31
I do take your point, but none of these things are absolutes. An exchange can't force miners to do something not in the interests of Bitcoin users, because Bitcoin users can always quickly and easily reject the exchange (and, as a nuclear option, the miners too). Rather, these are checks and balances.
All that said, Bitcoin will *always* move in a direction which someone, somewhere disagrees with -- or not move, which someone else, somewhere will also disagree with. It can't please everyone all the time.

There's a fee but it always seems to be cheaper than e.g. localbitcoins.

Are you sure? The essence of the proposal was: SegWit is not activating on the main chain so let's do something else _aimed at satisfying everyone_ in the most efficient way possible. SegWit fans will like SegWit-like features of the ext block, bigger block fans will like the bigger capacity increase. There was no need to ensure the viability of SegWit on the main chain. It looks like they'll now put in the extra work and kludgery to allow SegWit on the main chain, but that's more to placate the mob who can't accept that main chain SegWit might never happen AFAICT.

Completely agree but I do think improvements that deal with _fees in the context of block space scarcity_ are necessary (which you may have discussed in your other comments).
I have nothing against fees -- they are, after all, intended to replace the block reward subsidy long term. However...
With a hard block size limit, that fee market is shaped by an actual supply constraint (block space scarcity) -- rather than, for example, miners refusing to process zero fee transactions. Block space scarcity means transactions don't get done. Not just, "oh they need to pay a higher fee". They don't get done at all, because there simply is no space.
High fee TXs will get done _only because_ low fee TXs do not get done. At some point, those people go elsewhere.
The tricky thing is measuring and controlling that outflow of users (users at the edges who are not willing to pay higher fees to fight for limited block space).
Who measures "people leaving", who decides when too many people are leaving, and who decides what is done to prevent them leaving (the primary risk being sudden and mass migration, which would be very difficult to prevent or undo)?
With a hard limit, the only option is adjusting that limit, which necessarily means someone making a decision and the entire ecosystem agreeing. Hard forks 2-3 times a year, perhaps. But that seems unlikely, no?
Miners could choose to lift the limit simply because they would be missing out on fees. But could they co-ordinate and react quickly enough?
(As an aside, one measure of "people leaving" might be to look at Bitcoin's market cap vs other alts. In which case, we may already be experiencing "people leaving". To say nothing of "people not joining"!)
So block size or some other scalability solution might be the one improvement that is, in fact, necessary to maintain Bitcoin's usefulness (no point having a censor resistant coin that everyone has abandoned).

Let's wait for the ASICBOOST stuff to be _proven_, which should be easy to do. Let's also wait for Bitmain's response. Then let's see if miners assist in activating Greg's proposed change to prevent _covert_ ASICBOOST use (if they accept that but resist full SegWit, then we're still at square 1). Whatever the case, this is likely to take time to resolve.
EDIT: Obviously it would be nice if miners suddenly pushed for SW but seems unlikely until we hear more on ASICBOOST.
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:58:27
SegWit as a SF was a great idea but let's be honest, it's not the immediate _can-kick capacity increase_ a large portion of the community was asking for; the capacity increase it provides is not predictable-- in fact it's potentially very slow and not even guaranteed.
I choose to ignore nonsense politics and arguments like "Blockstream is using Core to strangle Bitcoin and create demand for its products" and "BU wants complete control of and/or to destroy the protocol". Equally, calling each and every hard fork proposal "hostile" or an "attack" reeks of politics.
We need not define everything as a political battle, win or loss. If Core, knowing that SegWit-only is not happening, decides to support bundling SegWit and all its advantages with a HF increase, great! I will update my Core node right away (and I won't consider Core to have backed down or been defeated or displaced in any way, shape or form-- if anything, Core will be stronger).
@_date: 2017-04-01 08:41:19
Even BU requires user consent (running BU in the first place, with settings that give miners effective control over block size, or running something else that allows for larger blocks). There has been some posturing and bluster around a 51% attack but no one should take that too seriously. The miners won't move without very significant user support. (I still don't support BU or EC.)

Pragmatism is good, but do recognise that under the current plan, Bitcoin is now not able to repeat the growth of the last year, let alone handle any uptick.

@_date: 2016-02-03 16:35:41
It's an interesting question, and nothing wrong with testing the edges *per se*, just not without a plan in place.
You are, after all, encouraging people to leave Bitcoin for alternative payment methods. You want to be confident, therefore, that you can control the flow of people leaving. There is always a risk of reaching a tipping point (sudden and mass migration to alts) if you fail to control that flow.
More to the point, how do you measure (and who is responsible for measuring) "people leaving"? If it's market cap vs alts, the current situation looks a lot like "people leaving". If market cap is evidence of people leaving, for how long do we let it continue?
Who decides when to tweak the block size limit? Do we leave it to miners and their discretion to patch software themselves or move to alternative implementations? Or should Core step in? If Core should step in, what is their plan -- or is it a case of "let's cross that bridge when we come to it"?
Personally, I think if we are to test (force) a fee "market" (i.e. with people leaving at the edges), a plan should be in place.
Regular hard forks is one option, or the hard limit could be lifted (considerably) and easier and quicker to maintain soft limits used.
In theory, if fees get super high then miners would lift the limit themselves anyway (because they would be leaving money on the table). Maybe this will become compelling after the halving in July, or the following halving. But query how quickly they could (collectively) react.

You have taken that tweet out of context (or maybe you missed the rest of the conversation). 
Also, on the mailing list, they considered that concerns around SegWit on the main chain could be addressed... _before your ASICBOOST reveal_. Completely contrary to your assertion of an unwillingness to amend.


Any evidence beyond Samson Mow's fake news tweet? There must be something, given that this has already been publically denied. Surely you're not propagating fake news?

Bitcoins are digital bearer assets. You hold, send and receive. Ripple tokens are IOUs - messages passed around. You don't receive £100 via Ripple, rather you receive an IOU for £100, which may or may not be honoured. Ripple has a token, XRP, but the system is not sufficiently decentralised and censor resistant to call that token a digital bearer asset.
People used to "move" bitcoins (still IOUs) over Ripple too (may still be possible), which didn't work out well for those holding IOUs that weren't honoured.
In short, no threat. They are very different beasts.
(All based on my limited understanding of what Ripple is/was -- happy to be corrected.)

Don't overstate the UK's "non-reversible" payment options. Transfers can still be reversed (or delayed for "security checks") and funds, including cash deposits, frozen.

The product is designed such that no one can know the private key until the OpenDime is physically unlocked. I guess you still need to trust the manufacturer (but the same is true for eg Trezor).

A split would require 25% of the hashrate to fight vigorously to maintain their minority 1M branch. Think about that for a second. Not only would it be very expensive for the miners involved, they would also be acting against _a supermajority that wants 2M_.
Coinbase, Xapo, etc are pushing for 2M now simply because they want Bitcoin to grow and they believe 2M now is the cleanest fix to the issue of full blocks.
Step back for a second and forget the question of SegWit first or 2M first. Ask yourself: should economically important actors - the Bitcoin businesses that have millions of users, that bring new people in almost daily, and that make Bitcoin useable, should have some sort of say? What weight should miners apply to the opinions of such users/exchanges/Bitcoin businesses? If you can remain objective, I think you'll agree that, collectively, they should determine the direction of Bitcoin. Not devs and not miners. This is how Bitcoin governance _should_ work -- miners should give considerable weight to _users_ and the exchanges and Bitcoin businesses that represent them.
We're watching this (Bitcoin governance) play out for pretty much the first time ever. It was always going to be messy. The saddest part for me: a group of less than 20 people in a room, mostly devs and miners, with zero representation for major Bitcoin businesses outside China, purporting to make a decision that binds everyone. That's not Bitcoin.
(For the record, I truly believe Bitcoin will be fine either way -- SegWit first or 2M first.)
I have been watching this space for years and this is the most centralised Bitcoin has ever felt. Less than 20 people. Several representing multiple actors in the ecosystem (e.g. miners that own and operate exchanges -- an ugly point of centralised decision making in and of itself).
I don't know if there is a better way. How can miners take "votes" from all economic actors -- right now economic actors can only try and make their voice heard.
All I see is people like Wences Casares, who have done as much for promoting Bitcoin as just about anyone, being attacked for voicing their honestly held opinion, and trying to shape Bitcoin in the way they think best. It's really bad form.

My take (can't speak for Classic or individual Classic contributors or anyone at r/btc) is simply this: we should use all the scaling and capacity tools available to us **because none of them alone is the "*real scaling solution*"**.
The technology (hardware infrastructure and code) allows us to increase capacity -- and will continue to allow us to increase capacity. Maybe not all at once, but gradually and consistently.
Increasing the block size is one tool. Stuffing more TXs into each block is another (SegWit helps with that). Dealing with bandwidth/propagation issues will also help (weak blocks, thin blocks and whatnot). We may even see the development of platforms that move transactions off-chain -- and that would be great! LN could work wonderfully for micro-TXs, for example.
If pressed, I don't think anyone would say Bitcoin would crumble under the weight of 2M. Or 4M in a year or two. Or 8M after that. Etc. So why on earth not utilise that tool? Core's take is seemingly this: we don't want to ever increase the block size until it is critically urgent (and we won't have a plan in place for when that happens). That, in my mind, in the riskiest play of all.

A separate node that you can set up and run yourself (or pay a nominal fee to someone else to run) that monitors LN payment channels for attempted thefts (i.e. counterparties attempting to close channels early, using outdated TXs, in an attempt to steal funds). The watchtower will step in and present the latest TX in each case, thus stopping the attempted theft and punishing (under the current LN implementation) the would be thief.
Presumably, if your LN node runs 24/7, you won't need this (or you might choose to use a watchtower as well to guard against DDoS)?

The thinking has always been that governments will one day invest in mining infrastructure or otherwise subsidise mining to protect their own economic interests. The articule assumes this is not the case, and that Bitcoin is allowed to become systemically important in the US while hash rate accumulates in China.

@_date: 2016-09-23 09:18:36
You're right, not least because Core is a wallet and it will be updated by default. The gains for others - and the perceived increase in "block size" - will be negligible, however.

My point was just that transactions using the traditional banking system should never be considered unstoppable or irreversible, for lots of reasons (though in practice you may never be bothered by interruptions).
Faster Payments generally works great but technically banks are only committed to making payments by the end of the next working day. Even then, the payments may be subject to security checks and may not be made at all. Santander used to be bad for that -- payments to new people would routinely be next day for me. Very frustrating when that happens. When payments are made, there may still be attempts to claw back funds (for example, where someone claims an error was made or their account was used fraudulently).
Bank accounts can be frozen (and, for example, suspicious deposits or withdrawals queried). Dealing with an anonymous person on the Internet - who may themselves be under investigation - may get your account flagged. As will multiple large deposits or withdrawals.
In short, it's not really your money unless it's in your direct possession (the raison d'etra of Bitcoin).
But yeah, the US is way behind when it comes to payments and transfers. Maybe mobile apps will make the difference.

That's not how tax works. If you make crafts at home and sell those crafts or even use those crafts to buy food, you will invariably be liable for tax on the fiat equivalent (tax laws vary by jurisdiction of course; the most common pitfall is doing something that you think is a hobby but the tax man sees as trade).
Great if someone successfully challenges the legality of this particular tax, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

Well now we're getting somewhere!


Core devs != Bitcoin network 
Yes, I do think it's an attack on Core (I'd describe it as routing around, but I suppose I could stretch it to "attack"). This is an open source project and if a team gets stuck for whatever reason - an inability to decide, fear, compromise, conflicts of interest, an unwillingness to make central bank policy like decisions, whatever - others are free to fork the repo and unstick development. I think that's exactly what the NYA signatories are trying to do.
They don't think the hard fork FUD (which exploded only _after_ the SegWit plan was announced) is warranted.

Me, obviously. Reminder: everyone was lining up for a HF prior to Luke Jr's SegWit SF idea. There was no suggestion then that a 2M HF would not be safe. Even Adam Back was in favour of 2-4-8.
If Core-approved, an increase to 2M would have universal support. The spurious "oh no contentious hard fork" argument would fall away.
Sure, there's a risk with any change - look at the BIP66 SF - but with the focus of the entire ecosystem on the block size debate, I think we'd be fine.

None that I can think of. For each miner, or the miners collectively, it's a choice between full block reward or reducing the total supply of bitcoins slightly (which makes everyone's bitcoins ever so slightly more valuable, but not nearly as valuable for miner(s) as the full block reward).

Best to Google "Bitcoin 51% attack" and explore.
In short, the idea that if someone controls 51% of the hash rate, they can do things that miners wouldn't ordinarily be able to (e.g. censor TXs or double spend), because they have sufficient hash rate to produce and maintain the longest valid chain (until user nodes render it invalid, of course). Even if they don't, users are necessarily _trusting_ them not to, which makes Bitcoin much less valuable.
Someone with that much hash rate could also troll the network (forcing occasional reorgs, messing with difficult adjustment, etc).
So yes, generally synonymous with malicious activity.
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:32:33

Nice to have more competition in the space.
A Luno invite if anyone wants to join (get €5 EUR of BTC if you buy/sell €250): 
I just wish someone would add Faster Payments support in the UK though... I'm having to convert to EUR, then deposit via SEPA transfer (which is reasonably cheap/quick using Revolut, but still).
EDIT: Quick review of Luno.
Interface is nice and clean, easy to get started. App (iOS) works very well. Basic ID is required (name, DoB, ID number) for "tier 1", which allows a very limited buy of up to €100. The next tier requires scanned ID _and_ a photo of you holding that ID.
The actual rate was €50(!) more than the market exchange rate visible on the app/website. Disappointing. Premiums are common for wallets with buying functionality (as opposed to proper exchanges), but €50 spread is excessive.
Minor nit: when withdrawing BTC, the interface doesn't seem to have a "max" button. You have to go back and copy/remember the exact amount.

Miners will continue to mine in China, bribing local officials/LE if necessary, and using other (discreet) means of monitoring the blockchain and propagating their own blocks and/or they will move equipment out of China.

Not wishing to dampen that enthusiasm but many, many people have tried similar things over the years, with very little success. It's a chicken and egg problem -- there just aren't enough Bitcoin-carrying customers for local businesses to care. Keep preaching the good word (without shoving it down peoples' throats, of course) and wait for the tech to develop (Bitcoin is still pretty poor for day-to-day payments, especially point of sale).
Get interested people to download a wallet* and _experience_ Bitcoin. Send them some bitcoin if you can afford it (great way of educating and, potentially, plugging them straight into the network and developing/utilising Bitcoin's great network effects).
*Coinbase and Blockchain.info wallets are good, if only because they allow friction free initial purchase of bitcoin. An important step for any n00b.
Who knows, maybe one day you will be the bridge (node) that connects your local businesses to exchanges, your friends and other customers on a Bitcoin Lightning network as mainstream adoption takes off. Right now is still too early though IMHO. Your efforts and enthusiasm are better aimed elsewhere.
All that said, if you do go ahead with your plan, good luck and report back!

Bitcoin Cash is a self-declared alt. Even they say it is not Bitcoin! You can hardly call it an attack. The market (for now -- I personally hope it crashes and burns) _ascribes value to it_.

The lesson is that miners are still making a fuck ton of money - probably more than ever. That was (still is) the point of the bootstrap phase. With the exchange rate and with occasional spikes in fees, miners can afford to be fussy. Maybe when the block reward halves again miners will be a little less fussy.

Not one guy (though his comments undoubtedly impacted some peoples' perception of Bitcoin). Two things happened in China, a big Bitcoin market -- an apparent ban on trading (which seems real this time) and China just relaxed currency controls (so quite possible that money will flow/has been flowing out of crypto to short CNY, among other things).
Everyone likes vol up (we were at &lt;$1,000 a mere six months ago!), no one likes it down. But you need to get used to both with Bitcoin. Have any fundamentals changed? I don't think so. HODL or get out, it's your call.

We have no way of knowing what throughput would be had Bitcoin's consistent TX volume growth been allowed to continue (i.e. had we kicked the can a couple of years ago). All we know is that TX volume growth stalled, Bitcoin's market dominance is greatly reduced and there's anecdotal evidence of use cases and businesses looking elsewhere/promoting other coins/being priced out by fees.
Agree (sadly) however that 2MB blocks right now probably wouldn't change much.

Yes, just download breadwallet on your new phone and enter the seed. And if breadwallet disappears (app removed from store), you should be able to use the same seed to import into another wallet.
Just be sure to have a safe and well secured note of your seed, and I think it's best to check it periodically as well (check they you still have access to it, that it works, etc).

I meant no obvious signs of growing beyond what it had already achieved (which I suspect was somewhat inflated) i.e. Core, which represented the vast majority of the network, wasn't implementing it, so where was it going, really? Without BIP91/SegWit2x, BIP148ers would simply have ejected themselves from the network. Their big "threat", which is pretty ironic when you think about it, was that _maybe they'd eventually get enough hash rate to wipe out the Bitcoin Core chain_ LOL.
BitPay did not backtrack so much as clarify their position (which Stephen Pair articulated a couple of months ago): BitPay is prepared for the practical reality of multiple chains, and the software it produces is adaptable. They naturally recommend btc1.
Whether you consider that position "a malicious attack on the network", or sensible planning by a services company who can't afford to ignore the Bitcoin chain (whichever that may be) or its offshoots in the future, well, I guess it depends on your level of commercial acumen (or maybe sympathy is a better word) and your penchant for conspiracy theories.
FWIW I hope you're right and it's all talk that comes to nothing -- or if it does happen, that everyone gets on-board because the reality is that the HF fear-mongering was just that. But I'm not ready to call it a bluff just yet. Heck, I did not predict BCH (a direct result of forcing SegWit). Anything can happen where _markets_ are involved; they are notoriously difficult to predict.

In a hypothetical where there is no block size limit (which I do not subscribe to)? Successful L2 solutions might make infinitely large blocks unnecessary. Orphan rates, maybe, and basic infrastructure costs/limits. And maybe something like weak/thin blocks or side chains or some sort of parallel processing would also reduce the need for v large blocks. But this is all decades away and assumes global mainstream uptake, which would be pretty incredible.

Anyone that _actually uses_ Bitcoin _regularly_ will run into problems sooner or later.
There are four interlinked issues. (1) _Any_ spike in demand _will_ cause an unpredictable spike in fees. (2) There is no such thing as a perfect fee guessing algorithm -- so if your wallet seems to keep fees low and always get transactions processed, that's because other peoples' wallets are doing a really bad job and their transactions are getting stuck. (3) Ironically, the only impact of improving fee guessing algos in _all_ wallets is to _share the pain_! (4) It's 10x or even 100x worse for people who actually use Bitcoin a lot, especially those who try to make Bitcoin _useful_ (e.g. businesses or services that accept Bitcoin). Invariably, they receive lots of smaller payments and pay out bigger payments -- that necessarily means bigger sized transactions which necessarily require higher fees to be paid. It is not unusual for businesses to pay tens of $ per transaction just because they are effectively consolidating many inputs. Future tech may help but none of that future tech is available yet.

Fair point, if it were true, but look at how the btc1 code actually developed. There was no suggestion initially of meeting the BIP148 deadline in any way, shape or form. It took a lot of persuading by a very helpful and active Core dev who pointed out that it could be done and that the benefit would be to avoid any kind of a BIP148 spat (including the retaliatory split, in the unlikely event BIP148 led to any disruption at all, that Jihan Wu had already threatened). In my mind, it's fair to say BIP148 played it's part, but it's daft to say we'd have SegWit via BIP148 had miners _and businesses_ not been genuinely inspired (by things other than BIP148) to make progress. Swings and roundabouts.

Companies can't change the direction of Bitcoin unless users sanction it.

This ignores the entire history of miners' calls for bigger blocks. Samson Mow was calling for 8MB blocks FFS. The Hong Kong agreement was basically Core rushing to convince miners to hold back on increasing the block size and wait for SegWit. Upshot: miners always wanted bigger blocks. Very few (if any?) were pro SegWit-only (so your claim that "concensus was, and has long been, FOR SegWit" is (and always was!) subject to an important caveat in respect of the miners).
NYA and SegWit2x was a reworking of the Hong Kong agreement, this time with the full support of the largest Bitcoin businesses (i.e. miners moved on from "we can force the issue" to "we need economic activity on our side").
Slightly ironic that Blockstream was running around trying to sign secret agreements with the hash rate years before Hong Kong even... Forgotten history, I guess.

You point out the contradiction yourself. Miners can't keep blocks small because they all have a huge incentive to be the one that doesn't play ball, meaning there'll invariably be one who creates the bigger block / includes the lower fee TXs.

"full block model" cf "supported by fees", not necessarily the same thing, to be fair.


A waste of money, maybe, but if the objective is to cause disruption (albeit temporary), it's extraordinarily cheap. How much disruption could millions of dollars cause?
I don't know that full or nearly blocks is the _wrong_ approach (or even avoidable, longer term), but it seems pointless arguing that full blocks don't make disruption attacks relatively cheap. You say so yourself:


It's an interesting problem for sure.

Are you saying the terms of the HK agreement were broken by miners implementing stage 1 of SegWit2x?? _They said they'd only activate SegWit when HF code was "released" in a version of Core, yet here they are activating SegWit!_ I can see the logic, but at the same time you had Luke-Jr trying to force SegWit upon miners without HF code (by promoting BIP148 UASF) i.e. attempting to bypass the Hong Kong agreement, and zero indication there would ever be a version of Core with HF code included. So swings and roundabouts. Probably better to consider the HK agreement long since expired, esp given the dates it referenced, and effectively superseded by the NYA (which swapped "Core" for "btc1", plus the support of businesses).
Never enough popcorn for this months long game of chicken leading up to the 2x update. The market doesn't seem too phased yet.

I have always been a bigger (but not too big!) block guy - sorry, but 1M and SegWit only, after all this time, is/was overly conservative, possibly to Bitcoin's long term detriment, IMO - **but** I have to agree, pushing ahead with the 2x HF is the wrong move.
With Core's heels dug in, and the sheer size of the "blindly-follow-Core" crowd (Luke-Jr's words, FYI), plus the sprinkling of very loud militant BIP148 types, an ugly chain split is all but guaranteed, along with a nasty, price shattering fight over the Bitcoin brand. I have to imagine the NYA participants know this and will ultimately back down, but this is Bitcoin, so who knows?
One thing I would point out. Very few of the CEOs that people like to bash nowadays are _new to Bitcoin_. They didn't just wade in and decide to change things up. Many are Bitcoin OGs who have been around at least as long as most devs. And they collectively - together with Bitcoin devs, old and new - made Bitcoin what it is today, on-boarding _millions_ of people and developing Bitcoin's all important network effects. They care deeply about Bitcoin and its fundamental properties. Easy to lose sight of that.

Yes, I know -- daily TX volume growth stalled when we hit 1MB blocks some time ago, and it may never recover. I hope that's not the case but I guess it's a reality we all must face. Yes, there were spikes in TX volume that may have been spam, but they should be ignored -- there was, in fact, consistent growth in TX volume over _years_ leading up to full blocks. I'd like sufficient capacity to encourage a continuation of that TX volume growth, if it's not too late.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:20:11
This boils down to a slippery slope argument that I do not yet subscribe to (I think we can be slightly more aggressive during this bootstrap phase and _still_ protect the qualities we all care about; but I am a long way from being a $20k node, mega block man).
Silly slippery slope arguments _in the other direction_:


A future where all main chain TXs must have a $200 minimum fee and must be &gt;$1m value. All other uses "not applicable". Yay decentralisation.


More importantly, it ramps up fees so we can be absolutely sure the main chain is the preserve of the mega rich, banks, corporates and governments. Yay decentralisation.


A glorious future where the main chain will be for open/close/swap TXs only, all carried out by said mega rich, banks, corporates and governments. Joe Public can still use "Bitcoin", so long as it's via a pre-opened LN sub-channel provided to him by his bank, after appropriate KYC/AML checks, of course, and with full TX monitoring. Yay decentralisation.
I half joke... there are real life investors who have suggested that fees in the hundreds of dollars per TX would be just fine for censor resistant money -- and I can see their logic! You can only agree with that future, however, if you're rich already or if you own a chunk of bitcoin and you're sufficiently greedy and cold hearted. ;)

@_date: 2017-09-18 21:36:23
Hardly. I'm not an unlimited guy. At a minimum, we'd need soft limits.
I just found nullc's statement - that miners can easily produce smaller blocks to increase fees - at odds with _one of_ the arguments against bigger blocks (fees would trend to zero / miners not including all fees would go bust / blocks will always be full because infinite demand). Either miners can easily produce smaller blocks to increase fees or they can't.
@_date: 2017-10-07 17:56:58
Yes, got that. Hence in the white paper Satoshi distinguishes between “arbitrary changes” (meaning TXs that make a block _invalid_ to other miners) and mere double spending or censoring.
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:58:04
Yes, and generally I support the _idea_ of being able to disclaim but I think they probably need to do more. Make users accept new Ts and Cs with very clear indications as to what rules apply in the event of a spin-off. Make them click something. Maybe insist on the withdrawal of coins pre-fork for accounts that don’t accept new Ts and Cs (if you genuinely can’t support the spin-off coin). Even that might not be enough. There are long established custodian/client rules that may apply - or a court may choose to apply - in some jurisdictions. Companies should properly assess that risk.
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:09:20
Putting aside whether all fee paying TX spikes can properly be called "spam", the larger data reveals the inconvenient (but astonishingly obvious) truth: TX volume rose consistently right up until the point of full blocks.
Full blocks means _any_ increase in demand leads to an increase in fees. Presumably you don't think the end of TX volume growth is a good thing... ?
@_date: 2016-09-30 02:15:16
Of course if the original fee is sufficient to get the TX into the next block, it could be a lot less than 10 mins.

You could try the Abra app - an Abra teller would swap for cash.
If it's a friend, you could try selling the bitcoins for bank transfer/cash deposit (I've bought/sold on bitcointalk.org, for example) and then give your friend's bank account details. He or she would need to tell you once they receive the funds, then you send the coins. If it's a larger amount, a buyer might ask for an escrow arrangement.
UK bank accounts are very badly serviced at the moment. I don't think any banks use Faster Payments. The person would have to find a buyer e.g. via Localbitcoins.com.
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:11:28
Well, that's the whole debate, right?
But consider the context of that Bitcointalk discussion, all the way back in 2010 when blocks were tiny -- do you really think Satoshi had in mind an extended period of full 1M blocks, a multi-year block size debate that would split the community, leading to a subset hard-forking away (Bitcoin Cash), all happening long before "needing it"?
@_date: 2016-09-21 21:26:48
Because there's no demand beyond 10 cents! So how to increase total fees? More TXs! (Not saying SegWit etc won't provide some increase, but forking to increase max block size is a valid tool.)
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:04:56
You think that excuse would fly where eg 2x takes 99.9% of Bitcoin’s current value (hypothetical)? There’s probably a line in the sand somewhere, but 2x is not it. A company should assess the risk of losing that argument.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:07:00


As you allude to elsewhere, query what those 99% of non-mining full nodes _really_ represent. If it's a genuinely tiny fraction of daily economic activity on the network, with the rest of the activity being represented by fellow NYA signatories (who buy miners' coins), what weight should the miners give them? From the NYA perspective, that 99% might represent nothing more than Core devs and a hundred or so UASF hat wearing types. Or it might not! It might take a split to find out. (I'm against the 2x fork btw.)
I like Luke-Jr's argument that users who aren't interested enough to run (and make use of!) full nodes shouldn't really be considered users, but then you still have the problem of possible Sybil attacks when measuring consensus.
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:35:14


Citiation needed for increased centralisation with 8MB max weight blocks. Also, "demonstrably no need" ignores completely the use cases that were developing that have now mostly been abandoned (you know, like actually using bitcoins to purchase things) and the migration of users to other coins.


Erm, no it isn't.


The (current) claim of 2.xMB blocks being acheivable with today's mix of single sig and multi sig TXs depends absolutely on 100% SegWit adoption.


No, they just want to see modest increases in capacity sooner than later. Given that everyone wants larger blocks _eventually_, I don't think that's an unreasonable approach. The hard fork FUD since SegWit-by-soft-fork was invented has been relentless and damaging IMO. So it's when, not if (and the "when" argument tends to get distorted by small blocks resorting to slippery slope arguments like "because centralisation" -- though probably aimed more at the extremists on the other end of the scale calling for $20k nodes!).
^ Notwithstanding the above, I am not, in fact, advocating in favour of 2x. I agree it's rushed, it does not have (an adequate level of) consensus out of the box and the fork in November threatens to be messy at best. If it happens, it happens and I personally - as a user of Bitcoin - will not rage-quit Bitcoin because of it. I'll hodl both sides and wait and see (as opposed to BCH, which I promptly sold!).
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:31:36


You're kidding, right? Sure, there have been _spikes_ in the number of TXs, and some of them could be construed as suspicious (albeit fee paying) but are you really suggesting that the _years long TX growth that stopped when blocks became full_ is spam?? Even with all the evidence of Bitcoin use cases being priced out, businesses looking elsewhere, etc? Look at the graph again. The 1M limit halted Bitcoin's growth (and SegWit will take a long while to kick in -- which nobody seemed to admit pre-SegWit, of course).


It's silly pointing to the current price. Maybe it's up because the first part of SegWit2x was such a success? :P

Or one share of Intel and one share of i7, if i7 was a spinoff -- maybe that's the better analogy.
Consider a scenario where the market immediately attributes 50% of Bitcoin's current market value to 2x. As a BitMEX customer, you just got fucked. I don't see anyone else (not even the _truly evil_ companies like Coinbase and Xapo) doing this. (Although I suppose Coinbase has been awfully slow to hand out BCH.)
BitMEX can argue that they warned customers and customers should have withdrawn (and split) coins beforehand, but that won't stop a class action.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:00:52
Yes! I was suspicious when it was first announced -- simply because the community seemed to be narrowing in on a can-kick hard fork, and SegWit-by-soft-fork seemed like a classic switcheroo (to something overly conservative and potentially detrimental). It's a much needed upgrade to the network, but a very limited capacity boost, in and of itself. Let's face it, the 2M blocks people were promising under SegWit seem like an awfully long way off. Still excited for all the other tech that SegWit enables, of course.

From his perspective, Bitcoin is captured. Bitcoin Cash is the only real way forward, unless certain-Core-devs-who-shall-not-be-named can effectively by removed via SegWit2x.
He's entitled to that opinion.
If you consider another project that he and Olivier J, among many others, are involved in - e.g.  - it makes sense that he wants to move on, open up new options and get on with things. I'm not saying I agree with any of it, but it is what it is.

It is actually a big FU to its own customers -- if I were a customer, I'd get my bitcoins out of there ASAP to protect my "free money" "airdrop" 2x coins. Cheering zero support for _distributing_ the 2x coins is bizarre.


@_date: 2017-10-09 16:28:29


It was 2015, so nearly 40 years ago in Bitcoin years, and Bitfury (traditional Core supporter) signed the NYA, so clearly they're not too concerned!


For brick and mortar retail, I agree, for online retail (a use case highlighted in the white paper) Bitcoin could/should be perfect. The problem is that _by recent design change_, it is not predictable or cheap -- the policy of block space scarcity is incompatible with predictable and cheap. It's great that we have SegWit, and I'm cautiously optimistic for LN, but the price may have been to hobble growth and damage network effects.


I don't think it's an emergency, otherwise I'd be strongly in favour of 2x. I'm really not. At the same time, I don't buy the FUD around hard forks and a doubling to 8MB weight.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:55:45
This is good news indeed. I know 95% signalling NYA was never an absolute commitment to run btc1, but I was still uncomfortable with that level of (advertised) hash rate support.
85% is still a bit scary, but this opens the doors for more hash rate to switch ahead of the fork block. It's becoming increasing clear that the legacy chain will survive and those that don't follow F2Pool stand to lose a lot of money (and watch Wang Chun rake it all in). The only alternative would be for the rest of the hash rate to dedicate resources to killing the legacy chain, which I just don't see happening.
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:50:18
I suppose my thinking was that if someone IDs and isolates your LN node (to max their chances of stealing funds) they also get your watchtower, so better to have a separate watchtower.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:02:23


If 95% of the hash rate moves it will be a _dead_ chain, requiring a hard fork to survive. The cold, harsh realities of a "permissionless" system.
More to the point, that 95% of hash rate would not move in November unless it was sure the _price_ would move with it. The unfortunate truth: the businesses that signed up to the NYA really do represent the majority of real world Bitcoin users and daily transaction volume. What will exchanges do? Reserve the XBT/BTC ticker for Core devs or give assign a new Bitcoin Legacy ticker to them? We don't know, but creating a legacy ticker is not beyond the realm of possibility (see ETC/ETH).
From the NYA signatories' perspective, the only people being left behind are a subset of Core devs who think that neither the hash rate nor the economic majority matter, and a few UASF hat wearing types. Disappointing, perhaps, but necessary for progress (in their eyes).


I expect sane users to trust no one, including the lead and maintainers at the Core repo, and the prominent voices that seemingly have their ear. Did you know, for example, that Blockstream has a history of trying to tie up the hash rate with backroom deals? Long before the Hong Kong Agreement. I'm not a conspiracy nut but what was that all about exactly? We don't know.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:57:08


Those for whom it was most acute have, in all likelihood, long since left.
I don't think anyone is saying SegWit is a bad thing and won't provide some benefit. The position of bigger blockers (and I don't mean those who want all nodes to be $20k server nodes) is that a _still conservative_ can kick could have relieved some of the pressure _a year or more ago_, giving everyone more time to properly integrate SegWit and work on Lightning and other longer term scaling solutions. Heck, time saved not fighting on twitter and reddit would have been worth it alone!
You also greatly underestimate the amount of work involved in getting _everybody_ on board with SegWit. Core hasn't managed to fully implement SegWit into the reference client yet... It takes time.
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:16:05

That's the slippery slope argument and I don't think it's relevant because users will not entertain paypal3.0/bizcoin/kyc-coin. If the NYA or some future backroom agreement was about a KYC hard fork, it would be dead already and I'd be wearing Mow's latest hat.
No, the real question is what do you do if 2x is simply a continuation of regular old censor resistant Bitcoin (just with a very slightly higher capacity, less FUD around hard fork upgrades and maybe minus a prominent Core dev or two (not that I think Blockstream, for example, would disband or switch to Litecoin))? Would you be interested in _that_? If not, why not?
(Forgive my prodding -- I'm really just exploring questions/thoughts here. I am not in favour of the HF either(!) and I'm not saying you're wrong or unjustified in your stance -- I admire your conviction, I'm just not quite in the same space; I don't think the intention behind/effect of the NYA is "bizcoin".)

2x will only succeed if users ultimately sanction it. If they don't, it won't. So rage-quitting because an aggressive team (comprising the biggest Bitcoin businesses and all the hash rate) _proposed a change that was ultimately accepted by users_ seems, frankly, bizarre. If users reject it (i.e. if legacy survives and maintains most of its value), I too will very likely sell my 2x coins. The BCH free money initiative was indeed a thing of beauty.

This is silly. Core came out and said it was going to ignore BIP148; the BIP148 node count was very small (with no obvious signs of growing) and comprised mostly of UASF-hat wearing militant small blockers, it certainly didn't include any of the NYA signatories or exchanges or any prominent businesses of note, and BIP148 had near zero hash rate signalling in favour (yes, it needed hash rate). People like Peter W dismissed it as insignificant. To say that "miners and everyone else realised that come Aug 1st, there was a very large number of people/nodes who would start rejecting non-SegWit block" is a gross misrepresentation of what was actually happening at the time.
Nevertheless, the 2x team went out of their way to avoid a split (in my mind they knew Luke-Jr and friends would probably change PoW after failing to activate SegWit -- so they moved to squash that "unknown" (this is pre BCH, don't forget)). But all of this was determined later (and pushed by a Core dev); getting it all done pre 1 Aug was clearly not their original plan!
BitPay did what all the other big companies have been doing: talking as if the HF is happening. They qualified their own blog post by the way, so not sure it even counts anymore.

The issue is (and always was) that SegWit required the entire industry to update _all_ its software, not just the validating nodes bit, in order to send SegWit TXs and make SegWit useful.
You need only look at Bitcoin Core for proof -- the reference client is not even fully SegWit capable!

Fair points, although I would hope the businesses that enable auto-buys will advise customers well in advance of the fork (and ideally require customers to click something to signal their acceptance).

Well, the Cornell study in from Feb '16, before FIBRE, etc, and was co-authored by people like Andrew Miller ( -- who has gone so far as to put "[2X]" in his twitter handle!) and Emin Gun-Sirer (very vocal on this and the inadequacy of Core's SegWit-only approach and has specifically mentioned that the study is already outdated in terms of what the network can handle (it's going to take me a while to find the tweet)). Granted, Christian Decker hasn't echoed the call for more capacity but then he has a conflict of interest*.
The bitfury report is even older(!) and guess who was a signatory to the NYA?
EDIT: There being a "conflict of interest" does not mean that the person in question is a bad actor or even _purposefully acting upon_ one interest over another -- I'm not accusing Christian D of anything! Rather it's enough that a conflict of interest (actual or potential) _exists at all_. For example, a law firm generally will not act on both sides of a case, even though firms are plenty big enough and their lawyers plenty independent and capable enough to do so. Instead they opt to remove any doubt, declining to act for one side because they are "conflicted". (Actually firms may utilize Chinese walls in certain circumstances, but you get my point.)
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:41:45
You missed “even if this is accomplished”.
In any event, Satoshi is merely pointing out that there’s only so much an attacker can do, even with majority hash rate, because the other miners will not assist by building atop the attackers blocks. There will be a chain split.
I agree that this is the reality today, however - fully validating nodes necessarily do this (ie help people to decide which side of the split to follow). It’s no longer about mining nodes only.
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:17:42
When lots of users* and miners get together and decide to upgrade Bitcoin together, they do not see it as a 51% attack -- on the contrary, they _want_ as high a hash rate as possible to avoid any confusion.
*By which I mean economically important nodes.
I think the better approach would be to assign temporary tickers to both (legacy) Bitcoin and SegWit2x Bitcoin. If legacy is dead and needs it's own emergency hard fork, can it really be expected to retain the "Bitcoin" brand?
"Where do you draw the line" becomes a really interesting question. Is it drawn at Core dev support? Or x number of "[No2x]" twitter handles? What evidence is there that a not insignificant portion of the Bitcoin economy is strictly _against_ 2x (as opposed to "will accept it if it goes ahead")? How do you measure that? If Bob and his fully validating node - and, for good measure, his USB mining stick - refuses to adopt a Core-merged hard fork in future years, is the Core compatible chain an "altcoin"? Does the ticker and brand stay with Bob? If not, where do you draw the line. Bob plus 10 FVNs? Bob plus 100 and an exchange?

First, those reports say nothing about the challenges or security impact of losing 95% of your hash rate overnight. Second, they are old reports and the authors of the very reports you cite(!) have been quite vocal in favour of a conservative hard fork capacity increase.


No, I don't. I mean that in order for SegWit to bestow upon the community a bona fide doubling of capacity as you claim, EVERYONE has to upgrade and use it. That will take years or indeed may never happen. It's intellectually dishonest to claim "doubling of capacity" when you know full well that capacity can't and won't be realised any time soon.


Good, so point me to other "technical engineering trade-offs". Because nobody - certainly not the reports you cited - seems to be able to show why a doubling of weight would be a terrible thing (other than hard fork FUD).
I'm not in favour of a rushed hard fork either btw -- but it looks like it is happening, so (cost-benefit analysis) maybe make it work? Or try and get it pushed back a bit? There's only one reason why not: politics (both sides, of course, but every bit as prevalent on the No2x side).

And yet did you listen when people told you it would be years before that "doubling of capacity" would ever be realised under SegWit -- if indeed it will _ever_ be realised? Of course not. You just kept banging on about SegWit being a 2M upgrade and SegWit being the only thing holding Lightning back.

Right, and 2x won’t succeed if users don’t ultimately sanction it.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:45:08
Other exchanges and service providers seem to be committing to, at the very least, enabling distribution (if not full support) of both coins. By your logic, if the legacy chain stalls and dies, or loses 90% of its value to 2x, customers get zero benefit from 2x?
Not sure where they’re based, but if it’s anywhere litigious, I‘d expect a class action, particularly if the value of 2x is high.

I was quick to sell Bitcoin Cash, but I doubt I'll sell any 2x, at least not until I am sure the legacy chain will continue and most of the market will support it. I think this will be the case but we simply do not know for sure. The worst case scenario (from the legacy chain perspective) is virtually all hash rate and economic activity heading off in the 2x direction and never coming back, leaving a dead chain that requires its own hard fork to adjust difficulty and, potentially, change PoW just to survive (and which will instantly be at the mercy of virtually every altcoin miner, including the massive CPU/GPU farms that Jihan Wu and the like already control). I would not be at all surprised to see the legacy chain trolled to death in such circumstances. Worst case!

Fair points, but nevertheless I think all custodians need to think very carefully about what duties they have or might be found to have with respect to spin-off coins (and I would expect any bar to be set way lower than something as obvious and potentially valuable as 2x).
If a custodian wants to try to disclaim all obligations and liabilities, well okay, they can try, but they should probably make users click something _at a minimum_. A mere statement or email or pop-up may not be sufficient. Heck, nothing may be sufficient in the eyes of courts in many jurisdictions — we’re talking about a custody arrangement and custodian/client relationship after all.
Not everyone has made a statement re the upcoming fork, but this is the first I’ve seen where a company has indicated that only one coin will be made available to its customers/clients.
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:21:19

@_date: 2017-10-10 22:20:13
Ha, you have zero technical arguments for resisting a doubling of capacity to 8MB weight. That’s why you are upset. At best, you have hard fork FUD, which means nothing, and mid-November you’re going to actually have to make a choice (because you won’t be able to transact on the chain you seem to want to transact on). But whatever, you hang tight and add “~~USAF~~No2x” to your social media handles.
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:34:43
Yes, I'm not quite ready to accept that daily TX volume growth has _permanently_ stalled. I'm hoping we'll see it start to pick up again now that there is, in theory, a little more capacity.
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:40:55
First, I was referring to the number of people behind the dev and implementation of btc1 specifically (i.e. calling into question the claim that this is entirely Jeff Garzik's doing and no one else is involved).
Second, and in any event, the relevant metric is _economic majority_. The NYA signatories and their customers arguably do represent the economic majority (certainly a majority of daily activity on the network). If they did not, the miners would not have the confidence to switch. (Maybe they won't!) Now, you can certainly argue that most Coinbase users know nothing about SegWit2x, and aren't real users or they're blindly following Coinbase, but that works both ways. As Luke-Jr will tell you, there is a big blindly-follow-Core group too (his words)! More to the point, if this was SegWitKYC and rather than a 2M HF in November, it was a HF to implement compulsory KYC, do you really think Coinbase's users would be equally oblivious? Of course not. Coinbase probably wouldn't have any customers left by now, and neither would the rest of the NYA signatories.
I'm not saying the fork is not _contentious_ btw -- it is and I would rather it did not happen. But all these claims of hacking and computer misuse and fraud are absurd.


^ Just providing some balance. I don't disagree overall though, 2x is an aggressive and _contentious_ hard fork.
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:43:51
They might well switch to 2x, but they won't dump/delete/withhold the legacy coins. They will be withdrawable, eventually, by customers (assuming the chain works). Heck, they're even handing back BCH dispite initially putting up all sorts of warnings and disclaimers saying they wouldn't support it.

Thanks, I had read that. I follow him, he’s a generally sensible chap. I remember Stephen Pair saying BitPay was prepared to work with multiple Bitcoin chains, so what Spencer B says makes some sense. If legacy generally keeps the Bitcoin name and ticker, that would indicate a lack of conviction in 2x (and help legacy retain its value, etc). My initial thought was there’d be two temporary tickers e.g. B1X and B2X — that would be slightly less aggressive than giving 2x the Bitcoin name and ticker, but still potentially confusing for customers.

There has been a scaling debate ongoing for a few years.
The Bitcoin Core team could not agree a hard fork increase in capacity, and eventually (some Core devs having left as a result) advocated a much more conservative soft fork capacity increase called SegWit. That plan, however, did not have the backing of the whole community. Part of the community - most notably, the miners - wanted the more aggressive hard fork increase. The miners opted not to upgrade their software with SegWit. A couple of Core devs and some particularly vocal Bitcoiners decided to try and force the miners to adopt SegWit using a particularly aggressive type of User Activated Soft Fork. Their plan did not have the support of Core, however, and would have caused a chain split (even if only temporary, given that their UASF actually required miner support too, ironically, which of course it did not have). Meanwhile, all the biggest businesses in the space - those that on-boarded millions of new Bitcoin users over the years, and who themselves had been calling for both SegWit and hard fork capacity increases - got together with the miners and agreed a plan: SegWit2x. The idea was to commit to running SegWit first and shortly thereafter a hard fork increase.
That plan is currently in play -- we now have SegWit (and the UASF chain split was avoided) and the hard fork (the "2x" part) is due to occur in November. The hard fork is contentious, meaning some users and businesses will oppose it, and Core (thus far) has shown no signs of merging it. That means (assuming you hold onto your bitcoins) that when the fork occurs, you will have both legacy bitcoins and an equal number of "2x" bitcoins. Which one ultimately becomes known as "Bitcoin" remains to be seen. Or 2x will be abandoned and there won't be a hard fork at all.
@_date: 2017-10-05 06:05:24

Isn't there opt in replay protection via OP_RETURN? No one else seems to have an issue dealing with both. This seems to be a poorly considered decision based on ideology alone (certainly not the customers' needs).
I don't think they have been sufficiently clear telling people to remove their coins before the fork. In fact, I think they should _force_ users to do that, to avoid any confusion.

If (huge if) a custodian of your BTC pre fork only gives back 2x post fork, then you have a claim. That's not going to happen with any of the NYA signatories. Worst case, you have to wait a little while to get your legacy BTC while they ensure coins are properly split, etc.
Them running new software, promoting 2x as Bitcoin, miners moving their hash rate to 2x, etc is not fraud or a crime of any kind. Sorry. (Not that I'm thrilled about it -- I'd rather avoid all this animosity and proceed without the HF, but some of the absurd lawsuit/criminal complaint claims being made in here just that, absurd.)
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:59:30
Vulnerable to what though? If this happens (huge if IMO), it will have been carried out not just by an overwhelming majority of the hash rate, but also with the full support of an _economic majority_ (one way or another). If only a minority are left behind, and they can’t even maintain their own minority chain, is it really correct to call Bitcoin (which moved on without them) “vulnerable”? Just pointing out the other side’s perspective here.
I think back to XT and Classic. If either one had the type of support (in terms of businesses representing economic activity) 2x has, we’d have more capacity by now. They didn’t, so they failed. The hard fork FUD since the advent of SegWit-by-soft-fork has been off the charts.

Ha, yes, sorry, keep forgetting your (very creative!) take on it.
“BIP148 would not have caused a split”
“Miners continuing to mine and ignoring BIP148 the same way Core ignored BIP148 would have caused a split”.
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:15:21
Except those “miners violating new rules” would not have been doing anything wrong in the eyes of Core and Core compatible nodes. Hence BIP148 proceeding with minority hash rate would have left the Core chain open to reorg in the event BIP148 were ultimately successful.

If you think changing PoW and starting afresh with zero hash rate, when literally every altcoin miner would love to get a chance at trolling the legacy Bitcoin main chain, _and_ you've just pissed off the biggest CPU/GPU farm owners too, well, I think you're delusional.
At the same time 2x and/or BCH adopt all the ASIC hash rate and the daily economic activity on the network and become, overnight, exponentially more secure than legacy Bitcoin. All because what? You're hard-forking because you didn't want to hard fork? 8M weight vs 4M weight? Seems suicidal.
I guess as a user, I'll HODL both. I certainly won't sell 2x like I did BCH.

Approximately 9,500,000 tera hashes per second provided by miners and the priceless nurturing of network effects by NYA signatory businesses.
What is the _benefit_ of staying at the 1M-without-sigs limit? That a few Core devs would otherwise rage-quit at the idea of users following the NYA?


Citations needed.


Elimination of a too small to measure sliver of security, perhaps, at worst. But vs losing ~95% of the hash rate and losing/damaging all important network effects? Completely insignificant.


You need to go and speak to some more engineers about the likelihood of us realising your "doubling of capacity" any time soon. This is precisely why miners and businesses were so keen on (and have been pushing for years for) a bona fide, hard fork increase.


Just so we're clear, you're not one of those people that thinks the main chain should forever be constrained by the effective 1M-without-sigs limit, are you? I think you'd be hard pushed to find a Core dev that does not expect a hard fork capacity increase eventually.


Again, citations needed. Point me to those terrible "technical engineering trade-offs" please. Presumably you don't just mean an aversion to hard forks?

Thought experiment: would Coinbase still be operating if the NYA was SegWitKYC, with compulsory KYC being implemented by HF in November?
I seriously doubt it. That is the difference here. 2x really isn't that bad (yes, it's aggressive, I get that, but getting consensus can be rough and maybe that's what was needed to get SegWit and a capacity kick? Without it we would have had a BIP148 chain split going nowhere). And don't bother replying with the slippery slope argument -- I don't buy it. When SegWitKYC is proposed, I will be buying Mow's hats, liking his tweets and preparing to stick it out on the legacy chain.

I like reading Tim Swanson's work because he clearly puts a lot of thought and effort in, but I can't help but think this reads a lot like a sales pitch for "permissioned" blockchains (i.e. Eris, etc).  It doesn't help that Tim Swanson and Preston Byrne are besties... and the quip about focusing on Unix at the expense of Windows, etc was clearly a late addition following the Andreas A/Preston B disagreement on Twitter.  Urgh.
The unfortunate truth for Tim S, Preston B, Jeffrey Robinson, etc is that Bitcoin isn't going anywhere.  Which means people will have to deal with it one way or another, if only to accept it's existence and validity.  It follows that anyone considering blockchain tech for their business will at some point - even if not now, because the Bitcoin brand is badly tarnished - think, "why are we trusting X, Y and Z to help maintain a database when we do not really trust X, Y and Z and there is a fully functioning, bulletproof, globally accepted, completely trust-less, tried and tested blockchain we can tap into?", i.e. Bitcoin.  (Or to put it another way, Bitcoin does not care.)
Consider financial institutions and the prospect of a permissioned, shared responsibility blockchain.  Newsflash: FIs simply do not trust each other.  The fact they are legal entities that can be "held accountable" is a red herring.  What does "held accountable" mean?  What impact insolvency proceedings, for example?  When the shit hits the fan, a permissioned blockchain will immediately freeze.  The FIs simply will not know which other FIs they can trust or that can be held "accountable" (i.e. whether they have funds, what their senior liabilities are, who they are in cahoots with, etc).  They will stop processing transactions.  Insolvency proceedings may well prevent movements of funds, or indeed invalidate and seek to reverse them.  All at the same time.  A bit like when interbank lending dried up practically overnight in 2007.  Read: years and years of litigation.  Perhaps an oversimplified example, but I just don't see it working.

@_date: 2017-10-09 13:26:03
This new narrative was oh so predictable -- and will be used to delay any hard fork increase for years to come (unless 2x happens, of course).


Or maybe you haven't moved all your coins to a SegWit address yet, so you can't actually use SegWit yet? Or maybe you use the current version of Core, which has a half-baked implementation that doesn't create SegWit change addresses? Or you use any one of the majority of mobile wallets that simply don't support SegWit yet (and even when they do, you'll need to move your coins first, which means spending money to save money).


It's a 4MB _weight_ limit. A 4MB block would be extremely weird and would likely feature 1 specially constructed SegWit TX with masses of signature data. It's an attack vector as best. Best case is blocks averaging 2.xMB.


Not that simple. It takes _everyone_ using SegWit to see the full benefit of SegWit. Without _everyone_ using SegWit, the "doubling of capacity" simply isn't there. That's precisely why:
- conservative Core devs like it(**!**), because the increase in capacity is delivered slowly over time, rather than all at once; and
- bigger blockers generally dislike it (as a _capacity increase_), because the increase in capacity is delivered slowly over time, rather than all at once.

Right, node owners sanction it by accepting and running the new code and other users sanction it by continuing to use the services of the NYA signatories.

Indeed, the development and use of a digital bearer asset (or digital bearer token representing X) - something that can be held/transferred automatically, using computer scripts - by major players in finance is v important indeed.  It is inevitable, in my mind, that some securities or instruments such as treasuries or loans or even part of the money supply will one day be tokenised in this way.  There are enormous costs savings and other efficiencies to be made.  And it all legitimises Bitcoin, the open, non-proprietary, censorship resistant equivalent of whatever they come up with.

My personal favourite is offline cold storage using Electrum.  Download Electrum here:   Read about setting up cold storage using Electrum here: 
Buy a cheap net top or tablet or similar -- something you can install Electrum on.  NEVER connect that computer to the internet.  Be sure to disable wifi, if it has wifi.  Use a USB stick to copy the Electrum install files to it.
Password protect your Electrum wallet to protect against theft.
Electrum wallets have a master seed which can be used to restore the wallet.  Keep a copy of this master seed somewhere (very) safe.  That way, if your offline computer is stolen or destroyed, or you forget your wallet password, you can still retrieve your wallet and bitcoins.
Buying a Trezor is an alternative.  Or some sort of multi-sig set up.

Not sure what people expect.  Liquidity and velocity are still (comparatively) pathetic (just buying and selling bitcoins in some countries is a pain and actually spending them isn't much easier), hedging options and other financial instruments are very limited, there are real regulatory concerns to deal with, no one really knows where Bitcoin will be in 5 years' time (save that there will still be some volatility!), etc.
Volatility should be a surprise to precisely no one.
There was a great animation I saw a while back that used two boats on the high seas to illustrate the point.  A USD super tanker, barely affected by the choppy waters (reflecting the size and maturity of the US dollar capital markets), and a small, Greenpeace-style Bitcoin dingy alongside it, riding up and down wildly with every wave.  That's where we are.  A tiny, insignificant "currency", it's value very much at the mercy of traders and speculators everywhere (though recently relatively stable, it has to be said).  Comparing Bitcoin to USD or almost any other established currency is completely nonsensical at this point in time.

Probably need to take a step back and consider what a 51% attacker might actually achieve.  Presumably you are not suggesting an attacker might steal all the shares of the multi-national in your example?
"By what mechanism" - There is already an extremely active community monitoring miner and pool sizes, unusual transactions and blocks, etc.  Probably because the entire value prop of Bitcoin is the security model.  If there was any hint that Bitcoin was compromised, the world would know.  (Heck, there are enough people waiting to sound the death knell for Bitcoin as it is!) 
Agree the legal position is fascinating, but disagree there is no legal recourse with "permissionless" blockchains.  A token will only ever _represent_ real world assets/rights/obligations, the basis of any dispute.  It is well within the powers of the courts to detach the asset from the token, or indeed enforce the link.  We don't need a precedent to determine that, but when we do see an actual dispute, it is far, far more likely to be a case of lost/stolen private keys than a 51% attack double-spend.

But it’s impossible for an honest mining node to accept and build upon a block that contains an invalid TX in it (e.g. a dishonest majority rewarding itself 100BTC in a block). The honest nodes ignore the chain containing the invalid block no matter how long it gets. Or am I missing something? The rule has since been described as _longest valid chain_, but it was always the case.

If they stick to their guns they may well promote 2x as "Bitcoin" and relegate legacy to "Bitcoin-Core", or apply temporary tickers to both, or relegate legacy by only allow withdrawals (no buying or selling), etc. Obviously if the market soundly rejects that move, they'd quickly adapt back in favour of legacy.
I'd much prefer that they and the other businesses abandon 2x, but if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. Then what? Just how opposed to 2x are you? Enough to dump your 2x coins and hope Core maintains the legacy chain?

Yes, agree with that, but when the white paper was presented, a change of proof of work to defeat the dishonest miners was not an option (because everyone was a miner).

Abstract is compelling:


based on proof-of-work (PoW). In this work we introduce and instantiate a new primitive
for blockchain protocols called Noninteractive-Proofs-of-Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs)
which can be adapted into existing proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies. Unlike a traditional
blockchain client which must verify the entire linearly-growing chain of PoWs, clients
based on NIPoPoWs require resources only logarithmic in the length of the blockchain.
NIPoPoWs solve two important open questions for PoW based consensus protocols. Specifically
the problem of constructing efficient transaction verification clients, sometimes called
“simple payment verification” or SPV, and the problem of constructing efficient sidechain
proofs. We provide a formal model for NIPoPoWs. We prove our construction is secure in the
backbone model and show that the communication is succinct in size.We provide simulations
and experimental data to measure concrete communication efficiency and security. Finally,
we provide two ways that our NIPoPoWs can be adopted by existing blockchain protocols,
first via a soft fork, and second via a new update mechanism that we term a “velvet fork”
and enables to harness some of the performance benefits of NIPoPoWs even with a minority

- Feels like online banking software, so log in on one or more devices with a password and/or pin, spend/receive or add transaction data on one device and the other devices will auto sync, etc.  Lose you phone you simply download the app and log in on your new phone/other device to retrieve your coins.
- Ability to set various security options e.g. set a spending limit PIN, PIN to re-login, etc.
- Add data (e.g. transaction type, payee, notes, etc) to all transactions.  That transaction data is encrypted (impossible for Airbitz to access).
- Built in directory of local bitcoin accepting establishments, ATMs, etc.

Yes, Bitcoin delivers no benefits at all.  Let's all try to ignore it already.
It's perfectly natural that middlemen will pop up and attempt to bridge the gap between Bitcoin and the market (whichever market that may be).  When Bitcoin itself is established (i.e. in hearts and minds), those intermediaries will fall away.

Dev kits can be prop hardware though.  Game consoles, for example, before they became mostly standard PC components. Surely this _dev kit_ is about developing using the software *and* hardware.  A Pi with the software is only half of the proposition.  I suppose there might have been a way to simulate what their prop chip does, but better to start building the infrastructure immediately.  I still think it should have been loss-leading though, and consumer versions/embedded chips will have to be a lot cheaper.

I suspect if this was a case of OP selling his car to a local car dealer, there would be no issues whatsoever and no questions asked. The bank would not ask the OP where he got the car or where the car dealer got the money to pay for the car.
Bitcoin is being treated differently simply because they don't understand it and because it has a terrible rep.
If there was a real KYC/AML concern, they would have filled a suspicious transaction report, his account would be frozen and the application for a loan would be on hold.

Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to prove that funds are e.g. the funds of a pimp smuggling cash earned by his rosters of child prostitutes and beggers, to be taken across a border to swap for cars, weapons, gold, etc.  Because all said pimp needs is a dodgy lawyer and evidence of a transfer of property and he says, "Oh all this cash in the suitcase? It's fine, I sold a house, that's all."
Money laundering rules were put in place in an attempt to disrupt these and similar practices.

Their aim is to build viable infrastructure (i.e. _hardware_).  This is a dev kit to get chips out there and test the infrastructure.  Their product is a software/hardware combo.

But it is a dev kit.)

There can be no competing standard. It's either "censorship resistant" or it isn't. No bank or start-up is going to create a censorship resistant coin.
I'm holding long (albeit nominal amounts) because I still see Bitcoin as the biggest/most secure/most highly supported censorship resistant game in town.  And that censorship resistance is what separates it from everything else banks and start-ups are working on.

enterprise-scale shared ledger solutions to meet banking requirements for security, reliability, performance,

Personal favourite is Airbitz on iOS/Android.

@_date: 2015-09-18 09:19:32
If I understand correctly, you're argument is:
(1) Bitcoin businesses "don't make profits by transmitting bitcoin" and therefore can't be "in the business of money transmission".
(2) If they can't be "in the business of money transmission", it follows that they can't be "authorized pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 2030) of Division 1.2 to engage in the business of money transmission".
(3) If they can't be so authorised, if follows that they can't be a "money transmitter" as defined by the California Financial Code.
Is that your argument?
If it is, your argument fails immediately at point (1).
You need to look at Division 1.2 of the California Financial Code (i.e. the Money Transmission Act, which sets out what "money transmission" is) to determine _whether you are in the business of money transmission_.  Division 1.2 has its own set of definitions, which I referred to above.

My point was simply that there are lines to be drawn.  Where do you draw those lines?  Money laundering rules aren't some scam to steal our money or hold us back, rather they were developed to address a genuine need (i.e. to restrict or disrupt the operations of large criminal gangs).  In this instance, the rule is really quite reasonable: it's fine (if not a little odd) if you want to move suitcases full of cash across borders, but you must first declare it.  The same rule applies to everyone.  You call it authoritarian and that's fine, I'm not saying the system is perfect -- but we elect representatives and trust them to represent and act in our interests.  Of course, not everyone will be happy all the time.

Further legitimises the tech IMHO.  All the time they spend trying to make private chains work (and they will, for some purposes), Bitcoin will continue to operate, exactly as advertised.  More, it will develop.  An always on, globally available resource with unparalleled security.  It will be impossible to ignore.
I get R3CEV's appointment of Gendal-Brown, the IBM guy -- he seems like an ideas man, with a good understanding of legacy systems and an ability to assess solutions objectively.

I attend events, they send representatives.  I'm often surprised by the level of understanding -- not just at banks, but big tech companies like Cisco and IBM and settlement and clearing systems like Euroclear.  They are looking at all of this stuff.
Virtually all of the big banks now have "innovation labs" - as do VISA and MasterCard - and you can follow some of the people involved on Twitter and elsewhere.  They follow Bitcoin closely and they are very well aware of e.g. the block size debate.
Right now they're weighing up the options.  But I have absolutely no doubt that includes tinkering around with Bitcoin.  The longer Bitcoin continues to work as advertised, the less likely they are to dismiss it.

Aren't these *very* low value TXs with *very* low value fees -- you can't "run a bitcoin transaction" because the network will ignore you.  21's long term plan _seems to be_ to put chips in everything to create big enough pools to process the micro-TXs.  So the infrastructure and running costs for micro-TXs will largely be funded by users (buying the chips and powering them).

Why on earth keep the name Stellar?  That brand is permanently damaged.
@_date: 2015-09-16 18:18:52
Sure.  Section 2030 of the California Financial Code.  It says that a person shall not engage in the business of money transmission unless licensed or exempt from licensure. "Money transmission" includes "selling ... payment instruments".  "Payment instrument" includes "... or other instrument for the transmission or payment of ... monetary value, whether or not negotiable".  "Instrument" is not defined, but "monetary value" is.  It means "a medium of exchange, whether or not redeemable in money".
It is not a stretch for the Money Transmitter Division of the DBO to seek to apply this to cryptocurrency transfers.
Even the EFF agrees (its argument was the DBO will be slow to act -- great!).
Ignorance of the law is no excuse (that's well established).  Unfortunately, lots of these rules and regs are so widely drafted they might well be applied to cryptocurrency businesses (or even people dealing in cryptocurrencies that don't even realise they are "doing business"), as I said, at the whim of the regulators.

Trust between banks is a variable that can go to zero overnight.  Worse, banks are so interconnected (yet oh so opaque) that any loss of trust will likely be shared by each participant or nearly every participant _all at once_.  Imagine a liquidity crisis like in 2007 -- the banks have no idea who is solvent and who is not.  Are they going to continue to process transactions for suspect banks on their shared blockchain?  No, the whole thing grinds to a halt.
People keep banging on about know-your-miner and know-your-node when the reality of legal recourse is _years_ of legal wrangling and (more often than not) _limited recovery_.  Does the shared blockchain continue to operate in the meantime?  Highly unlikely.
Private blockchains will doubtless find uses but I think it has more to do with smart contracts and, more specifically, ethereum code at this point.

That's odd. I wonder why that's happening, given that there should be no shortage of TXs in the mempool.
Are miners hashing based on the number of transactions they/pools have been able to properly validate (i.e. start hashing an empty block based on the block header, start validating TXs, update candidate block after ~ 1/3 of TXs validated, then update candidate after another 1/3 of TXs validated, etc) -- or is validation much quicker than that?

Just as nobody is so extreme as to suggest it should be _all block size increases all the time_, without any other forms of on-chain optimisation or L2 scaling solutions.

I'm not sure that's true; the debate started years before SW-as-a-SF was an option. There was ample opportunity to roll out a HF increase well before then, let alone before _whenever SegWit activates_. Core just couldn't coordinate on that and the main reason seemed to be that one side within Core wanted to delay any HF and actively test persistent block space scarcity on the main chain (for the various reasons alluded to here:

Agree. It's a big ask for open source but the opportunities are there and it's interesting to see progress being made -- take Africa, for example, there are several remittance projects, micro-payment and micro-loan projects, local currency and Bitcoin/M-Pesa exchange projects, dumb phone projects, cross border trade projects, etc, all developing at the same time.  Slowly, the gaps will fill, Bitcoin services will overlap and interconnect and people using one service will recognise and realise the benefits of using other Bitcoin services.  Before long, Bitcoin is a thing, a viable and even preferable alternative.  We hope.

I don't disagree that a rushed hard fork is bad -- I am not in favour of following through with 2x.

There are a few different points raised in the paper, but none relate to the price of bitcoins. Very briefly:
- Currently, the block reward means miners can mine empty blocks (i.e. in the brief period before they are able to properly validate the TXs in the current block and build their full candidate block). If there's no block reward, they would be better off _not mining_ during that (brief) period. If all miners decide not to mine, blocks will be found slightly more slowly and the difficulty might adjust downwards as a result. I don't see this a particular issue -- block propagation tech (and ideas around improving that in future) largely deals with that brief period.
- A miner might choose to mine an empty block nonetheless (because switching on and off might be impractical -- or a pool might encourage its miners to keep mining), in which case, if they find a block very quickly (in that brief pre-validation period), it might make sense to hold onto it, start mining a new block on top of it and hope they get lucky (i.e. they find the next block quickly, in which case they will have two blocks to push to the network and a good chance of orphaning any competing block found by the other miners -- so a form of selfish mining). They also did some simulations and provide some data that suggests that selfish mining generally might be more profitable in the fee-only era.
- If there is, say, a maximum of 5BTC of fees a miner is able to put in his candidate block, but 25BTC of fees in the block that the miner would be building on top of, it might make more sense for that miner to try to replace the current block -- he could even encourage miners to build on his replacement block by not taking all the fees (so he gains, say, 10BTC of fees rather than 5BTC of fees, and leaves 15BTC of fees on the table to encourage other miners). An interesting form of sniping, which does make some sense. I don't know that fees would vary that much, but a particular miner might have some other reason for not being able to build a fee full block. They do say that a consistently full mempool (i.e. full blocks/the constant supply of fee carrying transactions) would mitigate the issue somewhat. Interestingly, they conclude that if all miners/pools start to undercut in this way, it would lead to a growing backlog of transactions.
I have skimmed so there are probably other points I missed, and plenty of nuances. It seems accessible, so worth a read. One for the weekend!

I imagine an emergency HF to fix a critical bug would be made with or without 100% support. HFs don't require 100% in that sense. And anyone left behind doesn't actually lose bitcoins -- they can access them, and sell if they feel the need, on the new chain. Obviously you'd want the vast majority of nodes and hash rate to move together, but it needn't be 100% (probably impossible due to unmaintained nodes etc).

Coinbase is enforcing rules that don't actually exist. Donating money to Wikileaks is not illegal and yet Mastercard, VISA, PayPal and Coinbase won't send money to them -- why? Because of pressure applied by the state via the financial system -- effectively enforcing rules that simply don't exist. They have no basis in law. Hence, extralegal or extrajudicial.

You mean like an eater address (in which case, isn't that still a valid address, even though we know no one knows the private key)? Or are there other types of "non-address" that are still valid for the purposes of creating a transaction?


You mean in the sense that bitcoins aren't "received" until they are "spent"? Or something else?


What does "jumbling" mean in this context? Are you referring to the wallet UI? Presumably the bitcoins are not commingled (like money in a bank account) because the wallet merely identifies UTXOs relevant to the addresses it controls. Rightly or wrongly I liken bitcoins received to gold coins of different sizes; to send a Bitcoin payment it is necessary to melt down a sufficient number of coins (one or more -- as inputs) to create a new coin for the full payment (an output), with any left over gold forming a second (change) coin (another output). What am I missing?

All the banks have slightly different rules and none of them will disclose those rules to customers. There have been umpteen stories like this over the years - all in the UK - so surprised you think all is fine and dandy. The public mood should tell you everything you need to know. Banks have been demanding that customers provide invoices etc to show where the cash is going (WTF?) and denying withdrawals above certain amounts (which customers have had to guess at). It's ridiculous when you think about it; it's money the bank holds for the customer, it has no right to refuse withdrawals (beyond confirming ID and actually having cash on hand).

If the OP had said, "I sold my sofa/computer/collectable stamp", the bank would almost certainly have been fine. They wouldn't ask where the sofa/computer/stamp came from. Why treat bitcoins differently? Reason: _they have heard bad things_. So they take the ultra conservative approach of pretending "because AML/KYC".
As I said elsewhere, if the bank really did have an AML/KYC issue with the funds linked to the sale of bitcoins, the OP would have bigger problems than a stalled loan application.

That's not quite what it's saying. A full mempool only mitigates some but not all of tinge issues. In any event, something like fee averaging (where miners are rewarded with the average of fees over x blocks) seems to solve most of these problems (including blocks that aren't full).

This isn’t a traditional (ie miner only) 51% attack though. Can you call it a 51% attack if it has v significant _user_/_economic_ support? It’s aggressive but they would argue consensus is messy and going up against a tyranny of the minority makes it look worse.
I think it’s clear there is no consensus btw, so hoping they call it off, but I also see that measuring the numbers for/against is really tough (if not impossible) and clouded greatly by the position of Core (because they are arguing against and, in Luke-Jr’s words, there’s a big blindly-follow-Core group). I don’t know where you draw the line (100% support is impossible, so 99? 80?) or indeed how to measure it (simple node count doesn’t cut it, neither does hash rate only).

To be fair, its a confusing proposition.  $400 is a lot for a dev kit.
Personally, I think there's potential in the idea -- I can imagine, for example, a $20 21.co dongle or 21.co chips built into devices that provide auto login and pay for ad free browsing, etc - but a $400 dev kit seems like an attempt to recoup some money.  Otherwise, where is the cost?  It's not the Pi or the SD card, and it certainly isn't the software.  If it's the 21.co chip, they're in trouble.
@_date: 2016-10-11 15:33:08
Right, but that particular somebody can no longer properly validate all Bitcoin transactions. Their node is effectively lobotomised and their transactions become second class; they must accept SegWit transactions as valid, even though they can't check them, and they have to pay more for the same level of priority in a block.
I'm certainly not against soft forks or SegWit, but it's a little more nuanced than "if they don't want to use it they don't have to".
@_date: 2016-10-03 16:31:50
Hmm, you make a few assumptions that aren't quite right.
PoW involves hashing an 80-byte block header for your candidate block, not hashing the entire block. Part of that block header is a merkle root representing all the transactions in the candidate block. 80 bytes is very small already!
The difficulty for a miner is that in order to check the validity of the current block (the one he intends to build upon) and the transactions in his candidate block (i.e. that there are no double-spends), he needs to download the whole of the current block. That takes time. (He can mine an empty block based on the current block header, but anything more and he risks wasting hashrate on an invalid candidate block.)
That's where the bottleneck lies, along with the potential for abuse and centralisation pressure (my understanding, at least).
On other point: the 10 min (average) proof-of-work requirement is by design. You don't really want to reduce PoW/energy expenditure because PoW _is_ your chain security.

Maybe "the real community" rejects all three attempts (XT, Classic and SegWit SF).
@_date: 2016-10-13 07:35:54
As you know, empty blocks are found in the very brief period between a miner obtaining the current block header and the miner obtaining the current block (and validating the TXs in it). Some pools have chosen not to do that and that's fine (the main reason the number of empty blocks has come down!). There's really no way of magically filling those empty blocks, rather those _quickly_ found empty blocks will be replaced by _less quickly_ found full blocks.
Affirming blocks are 75% full implies there's readily available space and that's just not true.
Re fees, the small block crowd clearly wants to maintain permanently restricted block space and permanently high fees (presumably at the point where people are barely willing to pay vs other methods, testing price elasticity). The question is how high can they go? The miners in HK were told they could expect 100x the normal fee per TX. Even at $10, Bitcoin becomes uncompetitive for any sort of mass adoption scenario. LN won't help because who would want to pay $10 for the privilege? It's like paying $10 for an _empty_ pre-paid card, which you then have to top up. It would largely defeat LNs strongest use case (small, cheap Payments). Personally, I think Bitcoin would benefit greatly from vastly more usage. It would be more decentralised and secure as a result. It is still so incredibly niche. I'm not convinced the small block plan gets us there; it would be tragic if we failed to achieve (what I believe to be) the whole of the original vision.
@_date: 2016-10-14 11:04:39
A Bitcoin transaction must include a transaction fee (or else it's extremely likely it will not be processed). The wallets themselves (Bread, Copay, Airbitz) do not charge fees, but they do (necessarily) add the transaction fee.

It's possibly a centralisation risk, but the CEO seems to have thought of it (
As for delayed micro-TXs, I don't know.  Maybe 21 will reconcile off-chain wherever possible, or prioritise some and not others, or maybe they are looking further ahead and envisage payment channels making this particular issue moot.

If you think 1M is already too high, then you surely agree with ViaBTC's stance in blocking SegWit. SegWit hacks around the 1M limit to introduce bigger blocks.


Well, we've been hitting the 1M limit for a while now and whilst fees rose significantly, very quickly, that has now stopped. Meaning people are now talking their transactions elsewhere.
So 1M probably doesn't cut it. At least not with Bitcoin in its current form. How else can we increase fee revenue? _By increasing the number of transactions_ (and hoping the price of Bitcoin increases too). Those are the three key inputs: number of TXs, average fee and Bitcoin price.
This idea that 1M is somehow a magic number really needs to die in a fire. There are zero technological reasons for 1M over 1.1 or 2 or some other number (unless you really, really don't want a hard fork to happen -- in which case, be honest about that).
@_date: 2016-10-10 20:34:39
One of the selling points of soft fork upgrades is that they ignore the will of users i.e. miners activate the changes, which users must then accept. So no, running a node won't help you push SegWit through.
I don't think there will ever be enough BU nodes for BU miners to start building bigger blocks but you should run a node anyway. It can only be good for the network. :)
@_date: 2016-10-11 11:07:17
Are you sure this isn't a case of Bitcoin users finding their voice (i.e. setting up mining operations to ensure their voice is heard)? Ver's pool is certainly a clear case of that and ViaBTC seems to have come out of nowhere too (and is maintaining a good chunk of hashrate).
I guess we wait and see what happens (heck, we don't even have the SegWit activation logic yet).
@_date: 2016-10-11 10:23:42

Sure, but as fees replace block reward, why would a miner leave money on the table? It makes more sense to include lower fee paying TXs -- he gains additional fees at zero cost.
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:09:53
As always, miners are free to include (or not) TXs in the blocks they mine. Given that fees supplement the block reward, and processing TXs is a good thing for the network, we can reasonably expect miners to stuff blocks as full as possible. Some things might get in the way of that -- some miners mine during the brief before they are able to download and validate the TXs in the current block, for example, creating the occasional empty block, or a miner might not actually have a mempool full of TXs for whatever reason (TIL recently: a node crashing can wipe the mempool), which could result in a block that isn't full.

I use normal payment methods - debit cards, credit cards, PayPal, etc - for 99.9% of payments too, but not sure that's relevant. 
Crucially we have unfettered access to a nearly free, completely unstoppable payment method where borders are irrelevant and (more often than not) we can avoid supplying all sorts of personal and payment information (that may later be stolen or leaked).  I may not use it much, and "most people" may not realise its importance, but it's there -- for me and for everyone else.  This is (and will always be) invaluable, much more so for people with no access to banking or where fees are very high or where they really do care about censorship.
A couple of examples where Bitcoin has actually been useful for me:
- Sending a few hundred dollars to a friend in the US (from the UK). I have done it a couple of times and sending money e.g. via PayPal is *hugely expensive* by comparison.  People give away enormous amounts of money to banks and payment processors each year simply because they need to send money abroad.  My friend has since set up a Coinbase account and it's now very easy and much cheaper.  She has also accepted a Bitcoin payment from someone else (she sells paintings), which was something of a revelation for her; an instant payment from an overseas buyer who was much happier not paying an extortionate conversion fee.
- I ordered a temporary sub to a file hosting site.  Again, no fees for transacting in a different currency (choice was USD or bitcoins, obviously helped that I already had bitcoins) and, crucially, no need to provide reams of personal details or payment information.  For online orders with online delivery, paying in bitcoins *should be* a no brainer for people that have them -- and getting them is getting easier.  In the UK, Coinbase does instant credit card purchases of &lt;£100 (per day).
I'm really looking forward to OpenBazaar for the same reasons -- fee free (or nearly free) trading, with no borders.  eBay and PayPal together take an unreasonably large cut from every single eBay sale -- it need not be that way.  A successful OB could be cheaper for buyer and seller.
As a final point, I live in the UK and yet I maintain a balance of euro.  The reason is simply because I travel to Europe several times each year and it's not always worth swapping back and forth.  It makes me think a global currency could be an incredible thing.  I find myself actively checking out Bitcoin options wherever I go.  Take away the need to cash in/cash out, and Bitcoin can be very useful indeed (particularly as the price becomes more stable).  It's a chicken/egg problem, of course, but I think things will change.  Projects like Abra ( will help.
This is to say nothing of the myriad other uses for Bitcoin (i.e. beyond the currency aspect).  Bitcoin will continue to grow - in wildly different areas across many sectors - *simultaneously* and *globally*.
All these things make me think Bitcoin has long term utility and long term value (even if "most people don't care about censorship").
Just my 2 satoshis.

We don't know what Bitcoin will become, but let's not be content with a limited use, extremely niche settlement system that only a tiny portion of the population uses. Let's keep that original aim in mind, even if the best way of achieving it really is via layer 2 solutions.

I think this relates to one very specific, easy to prosecute under, law - 18 USC 1960, which makes it an offence to "transmit money known to the transmitter [to be] intended to finance criminal activity".
Bottom line: if you trade bitcoins and a buyer tells you they intend to use the coins for illegal purposes, DO NOT TRADE.  Walk away.

@_date: 2016-10-18 13:42:18
Point taken, but I'm not convinced VISA does truly "independent" TXs either (there's lots of netting at various levels!). Also, LN users will invariably receive money too (eventually, ignoring chicken-and-egg problems), which could render the _independent_ number largely irrelevant.
@_date: 2016-10-21 16:04:29


It won't. There are various ideas for dealing with these types of issues, none of which go against the inflation schedule or the promise of a fixed supply of bitcoins (an essential element of Bitcoin's value proposition).
@_date: 2016-10-10 20:51:51
You don't sense any irony here? The HK agreement where miners were asked to commit to only ever running Core-compatible software? The very concept of soft forks (changes imposed on users by miners)? Core brought us here -- using miners to try to impose the SegWit soft fork plan. Some users strongly disagreed with that, so much so that now we have two dissenting mining pools, ViaBTC and Ver's pool (when it opens to the public). That's what happened and that's kinda what Nakamoto consensus is all about.
FWIW I think we'll get SegWit done and I think that's the right move. But making changes shouldn't be easy (where have we heard that argument parroted before?). If nothing else, it's another fascinating test of Bitcoin's governance, resilience, etc.

There's an equivalent of this thread in the other sub. On the one hand, jstolfi is anti-Bitcoin, so he is reviled everywhere, including on the other sub. On the other hand, jstolfi does seem capable of putting aside his objections and critically assessing (among other things) both sides of the block size debate; his conclusions largely match those of bigger block supporters (i.e. increasing the block size is one tool among many that should be used and now is a good time to do it). In particular, he sees SegWit as less than perfect and he worries about the very real potential for conflicts of interest within Blockstream (a corporate entity which, let's not forget, dedicates much of its time to private/permissioned blockchain products, even going so far as to join the Hyperledger project -- could that be any less Bitcoin?).
All that said, jstolfi's interview on BU was an eye-opener. Well worth a listen if you can put up with Chris and Junseth. Jstolfi comes across as a slightly quirky professor who has a bee in his bonnet about Bitcoin. He simultaneously finds Bitcoin incredibly  interesting and incredibly annoying. He refuses to believe there is genuine utility there. Nothing more sinister than that though.
@_date: 2016-10-18 10:46:07
Any idea why some blocks are half full or less (as I type, a not insignificant proportion of blocks as reported here:  e.g. blocks 434835-7, 434829-32, 434825, 434823, etc)? Presumably they're not emptying their mempools each time.

It always was, insofar as many Bitcoin users wanted a block size increase rather than Core's soft fork SegWit proposal. Now there's some hashrate backing that up.
Something has to give. As SegWit gets closer and closer (ie when the activation code is released and the hashrate starts signalling) I think we'll see some pragmatism.

You seem to assume Core controls Bitcoin and that they should be protected from "political pressure". Core does not control Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not and can not be compromised by mere pressure placed on Core devs. _Users control Bitcoin_. If the move by ViaBTC results in Core devs supporting a can-kick hard fork (it won't), _users would still have to consent to that change_.
@_date: 2016-10-12 08:46:16
Re expense, that's certainly the hope, but let's face it, SegWit doesn't really add that much space and "normal" transactions are still second class.

The problem is with latency and block propagation, which gets worse with larger blocks (although some would point out that modest increases - 2-4M now, more as Internet infrastructure improves - are not a problem).
Very big blocks arguably advantage the largest miners with better infrastructure. They can receive and propagate blocks quicker than smaller miners with poorer connectivity. Imagine a very well connected miner broadcasting a very large block. That miner can work on top of that block while other miners are still trying to download it and check its validity. They could gain further advantage by, for example, employing selfish mining techniques.
Ultimately, it becomes another centralisation pressure.
Hence much of the focus for developers has been trying to minimise the block propagation issue, with better relay networks, weak/thin blocks and exploring ideas like IBLT, etc.

You do realise that that fee guess can be wrong, right? Routinely wrong in times of increasing demand. If everybody uses the same advice, transactions _still get stuck_.

Bitcoin miners can choose to mine empty blocks regardless. They choose not to. Empty or not, each valid block extends the (valid) proof-of-work chain, so yes, even empty blocks help secure the chain.
Miners don't usually mine empty blocks - it costs nothing to add TXs to their candidate blocks and take the associated TX fees, so once they have the previous block (and validate the TXs in it) they might as well add new TXs to their candidate. In any event, processing TXs is _a good thing for Bitcoin_, so miners will act accordingly.
The one time a miner might mine an empty block is when he chooses to mine atop a block header (i.e. during the brief period between the miner acquiring the block header of the current block and acquiring and validating the TXs in the whole of the current block). Google "SPV mining" (and you already know about spy mining). If the block header is valid, and the new block is empty, it's not necessarily a bad thing.


That is the issue and those two things are tightly connected. See here for a brief note setting out all the main block size controversy talking points:

More likely we'll have a split caused by some militant small blockers. BIP148 currently has like 6% support (and much of that is probably signalling rather than enforcing).

@_date: 2016-10-18 16:49:27
Hmm, I must admit I ignored the assumption that Bitcoin will only ever process 3 TX/s on-chain (because it's a very odd assumption to make). Even so, I can imagine a wildly successful LN, with people regularly receiving funds as well as spending, where the "minimum realistic on-chain access" a person might need really is one or two TXs per year. Heck, they may never need to cash out. Maybe someone will invent some form of LN balance/account holding secure device that can be safely passed on, reducing the need to open/close new channels. I don't know. None of this exists now, of course, but if we're imagining _a future LN that doesn't yet exist_ competing with VISA in terms of numbers of users and TXs, we might as well be bold with our predictions.
@_date: 2015-09-16 11:00:13
They are starting to think about these things, believe it or not.  
Probably unfair to say they should be investing already thought.  They are still trying to work it out and they are weighing up all sorts of other options too.
It's not like Bitcoin has a dedicated sales force either - not like the myriad start-ups pushing ethereum forks and other closed chain "soluitions".  And "blockchain" is one of many modernisation techs people are pushing.
I agree that if they do decide to experiment with the Bitcoin blockchain - and I dare say many already are - they should at a minimum set up a bunch of nodes and few miners and hire someone with the necessary skillset (still a relatively small number of people globally).  Looking further ahead, the most likely path seems to be acquisition or partnering with a Bitcoin company, but again, that sort of thing takes time.  In the meantime, accelerator programmes, innovation labs, etc will try to make sense of it all.

@_date: 2017-05-30 11:37:48
Just be careful you don't wildly overestimate the support BIP148 has.


You're right about that! Those signing up to the Barry Accord represented the vast majority of economic activity - number of daily TXs, value transacted, etc - on the Bitcoin network. That's the activity BIP148 requires in order to be viable. BIP148 also requires a decent amount of hash rate, which, so far, if we look at current signalling, it doesn't have.
It's easy to get caught up in the hype, but we're talking about a real life chain split here. People will lose out, and it may be those who commit fully to the BIP148 chain (which BIP148 kinda needs you to do).

On the one hand, I agree, it's amazing how far we have come.

The ski trip is an annual event and each year since has been exactly the same -- they're always surprised to learn Bitcoin is still alive and they still don't take it seriously. Pretty sure all my other friends know even less about Bitcoin.

If they want to add a TX to their candidate block, they necessarily need to check that the inputs for that TX have not already been spent in the previous block.
If they have all the relevant information - "miners have both chains" - then what problem are you trying to solve? Carrying out PoW isn't the problem so much as getting all the relevant information to the miner (and all miners equally quickly) in the first place.

If the dishonest chain contains invalid TXs, you will automatically reject it and mine atop an honest chain. The dishonest chain will not win. That was all Satoshi was saying.
We have a new situation now with fully validating nodes providing a similar defence for non-miners (except of course they need honest miners too to keep their honest chain alive).

You're right, of course, and there's really no way around that, but it's a big ask for anyone new to Bitcoin, particularly the less tech literate. It's a difficult concept to grasp (that TXs can be different sizes (in bytes), so different fees might apply). Then to be told, "don't trust your wallet, you need to check what the correct fee should be!" -- heck, I think I'd struggle if 21's website was down. :)
If we're going to stick with persistent block space scarcity (on the basis that miners will charge too low or no fees when there's available space -- which seems like an odd assumption to me, but whatever), then we just have to accept that Bitcoin will be unpredictable at times (in terms of appropriate fee size and confirmation time). Right now, that pain is felt most by people using (or subjected to) bad fee guessing algos. The irony is, the better fee guessing algos get (across the board), the more people will share that pain.
It's an interesting problem for sure.

Not that it necessarily matters; nodes and mining are quite different nowadays, of course. Who knows what Satoshi's advice would he?
@_date: 2016-10-16 07:15:05
No, this completely discounts network effect, which you well know.
Also, hard forks can be done safely. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a Core dev that would say otherwise. The Ethereum scenario does not change that. The SegWit soft fork is, however, the preferred route and that's fine. But hard forks will ultimately be necessary, so best not to get stuck on this idea of hard fork = bad. Several of the talks at Scaling Bitcoin were about changes that would require a hard fork. When the time comes, and there is no soft fork alternative, I believe Core will not shy away from a hard fork.

I agree, those pushing BIP148 are making significant disruption and even a permanent chain split _more likely_ at this point. Maybe there will be a tipping point over the next 6-7 weeks where everyone jumps onboard. If not, Bitcoin's price and reputation takes a hit. Maybe some short term pain is a good thing -- a reset of sorts, or an affirmation of what Bitcoin is and how it works. Or maybe it's not. Longer term, we can only guess. It will be one or two chains with a combined value greater than or less than the original Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-05-19 13:26:56
I generally agree but


we should be careful not to get carried away with the idea that "a lot of [Bitcoin] users" know what SegWit is or why TX or block size is important.
Even if there is a "grassroots" effort here on Reddit (debatable), it certainly doesn't constitute "a lot of users". So we need to look towards Bitcoin businesses. Maybe "a lot of users" are complaining to the businesses they use, but it's not to lobby them to support BIP148. Which is probably why Bitcoin businesses seemingly _looking in the wrong direction_ (towards SegWit+2MHF as a way forward).
Until Bitcoin businesses* - the ones representing _millions_ of real world Bitcoin users - start pushing for BIP148, BIP148 seems like a non-starter. Expecting them all to get on-board well in advance of 1 August is wishful thinking IMHO. I wouldn't be unhappy if proved wrong, however!
*As an aside, many of the hardcore social media personalities pushing BIP148 are the same people that have _attacked_ big Bitcoin companies for voicing opinions on scaling -- companies like Coinbase, BitPay, Blockchain, Purse, etc are unlikely to listen to them, frankly, let alone join their cause.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:41:00
Good question! Think long and hard -- critically assess those motivations! He wants smaller blocks, insists that we must avoid a hard fork, yet he's willing to risk a chain split come 1 August by promoting a very poorly supported BIP148, just to get SegWit done. Something is not quite right...
@_date: 2016-10-18 14:01:20


I'd just be wary of what 5USD per TX actually means. At that rate, larger (byte size) TXs, which can be unavoidable for Bitcoin businesses, would get very expensive, very quickly.
Obviously we all hope there'll be many more TX per "block" and an improved FX price in future, which will help reduce that fee.

Miners will experiment.  Some will cap.  Some will cap high, some will cap low.  20MB just gives them more room to experiment with (and they will).  If tiny blocks offered a real advantage, all miners and pools would cap at the minimum size.  They don't.
@_date: 2016-10-28 07:00:12
If you were to increase the max block size limit to 2M post SegWit, would the "4M block attack" become an "8M block attack"? 4M = 16M, etc?

Not sure why you think SegWit by UASF support will jump in terms of hash rate. In any event, what you really need are the businesses that represent user TXs. Coinbase, BitPay, Xapo, Purse, Blockchain, etc. Basically all the companies attacked by SegWit supporters over the last year or two. ;)

You are doing it, there's nothing to test.
@_date: 2016-05-25 21:08:54
Whilst I agree that Bitcoin is doing just fine, times are very different now than then (development of the Internet). Quite apart from anything, we have the Internet, meaning Bitcoin is being discussed, examined, used and built upon every day, globally, and information is shared in near real time. The fact there has been almost no mainstream impact is interesting. Certainly a lot of people have adjusted their predictions and expectations considerably.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:54:37
UASF currently has very little (objective - node count, businesses, Core devs, etc) support. It is being pushed hard by a small number of militant twitter trolls who seem determined to chain split (which is why I think Luke-Jr is trying to rally support i.e. to make it happen and actually avoid that chain split).
@_date: 2015-11-20 10:12:38
Not sure why you are being down-voted, given that you are technically correct. That said, I don't think any of the core devs/Bitcoin experts expect the block size limit to stay at 1MB indefinitely.
Banks are going to spend years and years developing their private chains. If they're lucky, R3 might prompt some standards and interoperability.
In that time, I think we'll have a much clearer idea of where Bitcoin is heading, which scalability solutions work best, etc.
Decentralisation will ultimately win, IMO, simply because it is all inclusive. Any bank collab will necessarily be hobbled and unavailable to half the globe.

You seem to be suggesting the definition - or your definition - of a HF is everyone moving together, with no node left behind. If so, that's fine, but it ignores the possibility of Bitcoin evolving without 100% node support. It also means the bug fix above needs to be called something other than a hard fork (since there will almost certainly be one node, somewhere, that doesn't update for whatever reason).

I said this in another thread -- one by one, the big block now advocates seem to be losing it. Not sure whether it's a case of having to up the ante in an effort to get things moving - increasingly desperate arguments - or what it is, but credibility is quickly eroding.
I do think a lot of people broadly agree with his "order of events" (the conversation he presents between Blockstream and The Community) but stretching it into an AXA-controls-Blockstream-controls-Core-controls-Bitcoin conspiracy is daft.
In any event, Greg M's response could not be clearer: "Blockstream does not have any patents, patent applications, provisional patent applications, or anything similar, related to segwit."

No problem.
FWIW some altcoins have incorporated node rewards (e.g. DASH with its master nodes), but none of the schemes are particularly compelling.

@_date: 2017-05-24 09:39:42
Looking at this objectively (doubtless this will be unpopular, but I'm merely presenting the view from the other side)...
Bigger block supporters: We want bigger blocks now, before blocks get full.
Smaller block supporters: Okay, we'll work on it.
Bigger block supporters: Blocks are full, so, bigger blocks?
Smaller block supporters: How about this soft fork SegWit hack?
Bigger block supporters: Erm, okay, but we want a simple block size increase too.
Smaller block supporters: Pfft, go get hash rate
Bigger block supporters: Done, here's a bunch of hash rate supporting our cause
Smaller block supporters: Pfft, go get economic majority support
Bigger block supporters: Done, here's the economic majority supporting our cause, so, bigger blocks?
Smaller block supporters: UASF chain split!!!!
Bigger block supporters: Erm, the actual users and economic activity are over here with us.
Smaller block supporters: UASF chain split!!!!
It's funny, there was a thread in here only yesterday celebrating Vaultoro's support of UASF. Now they're on the SegWit+2MHF list, they're part of an industrial oligopoly to control all of Bitcoin dev. Go figure.
I'm not anti UASF per se -- if successful (ie it brings everyone together to activate SegWit, without a persistent chain split, great!) but it _needs_ the users and economic activity on side.
@_date: 2015-11-20 11:04:52
I like your optimism, I really do, but we have an awfully long way to go before banks go the way of Kodak and Blockbuster. Not within our lifetimes, I say (though I may be a little older than you, with slightly fewer years to live).
It is patently obvious banks won't use Bitcoin any time soon. Which means the entire financial system will continue to operate exactly as it does today. LN and payment channels won't change that. What's needed are compelling uses and quite what they are, I don't know. Maybe we need another financial crash or two.

@_date: 2017-05-17 11:22:21
Node support is at &lt; 10%, and a good portion are likely signalling, not running BIP148. The number of major Bitcoin companies - those that largely represent the economic majority support that BIP148 requires - publicly supporting BIP148 is zero.
Not impossible that there will be a wild swing in support before 1 Aug, but "poorly supported" is currently, as best as anyone can tell, accurate. There's just no evidence of support to point to.

Don't be silly. The debate has been going on for years. No one could have guessed that we'd still be here, with a 1M limit, way back when the debate started. Granted, most have come around to the idea of "minimal-on-chain-via-SegWit-now", but years have passed and that doesn't mean anything and everything else is a state funded attempt at a hostile takeover, or anything remotely close.

P2P Bitcoin payments are virtually free.  Less than 0.2%.  Add the savings merchants stand to make (no fraud/chargebacks, receive funds instantly), and any discount applied by the merchant would make Bitcoin even cheaper.

I get that, although given Greg M's recent comments I am not convinced the HF code put forward by "dipshits" (his words, not mine) Luke, Peter etc will be accepted by Core. The point for most bigger blocks supporters is this should have been done last year. Instead we "stalled" and no less than three prominent Core devs felt the need to support alternative implementations -- if only to get things moving again. Of course, this is all ancient history already; we can now reasonably assume that we will hit the halving with full blocks. Fingers crossed, I guess.
All the other developments are great BTW. I'm still bullish, but at the same time it's difficult to know for sure that the damage hasn't already been done.
@_date: 2016-05-28 11:22:04
Erm, except Core is promoting SegWit, which uses more data overall.
@_date: 2015-11-06 12:08:12
Agree to an extent, but it really needs to be considered in context.
It's crazy to look back at just how far we have come in terms of media coverage. That is not the result of an echo chamber here -- it is genuine progress. More good news stories than ever before.
I remember when the only mention in the mainstream press of Bitcoin *at all* would be one or two words on one website maybe once every month, usually concerning the dark net. Now it's front cover of the Economist, heads of the world's biggest banks are being forced to comment, etc.
Sure, there's "bad" news too, and critiques, and buttcoin, but not of that is ignored.
@_date: 2016-10-05 16:58:23


Huh? We've been bumping up against the 1M limit for months.


This always amuses me. If a bump to the block size would result in fewer full nodes, then so would SegWit (both increase "full node" resource requirements).


We will never know, but I suspect had Core quickly backed a conservative block size increase - a can kick - it would have occurred without incident. Bitcoin is very different to Ethereum (not least the difficulty adjustment rules, which would have made it much more difficult for anyone to maintain the original, non-Core backed branch, without themselves effecting a hard fork). All that said, I recognise that the initial demands for a block size increase (20M IIRC) were aggressive, which made agreement impossible.


On the one hand, I agree. We are on a path, SegWit is almost done, Bitcoin still works (because of updates to Core and other Bitcoin software, particularly fee handling and mempool management) and the future really is bright. I remain bullish. On the other hand, fees aren't rising, which suggests people are taking their TXs elsewhere. We might never know if or to what extent Bitcoin has suffered due to the unpredictability of this situation. Case in point: noob thinks Bitcoin has a block size problem.
Just trying to provide some balance here.
@_date: 2016-10-12 07:26:04
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:09:08
I know, I agree, but _effectively doubling the block size_ is the max benefit SegWit can provide and achieving that max benefit will require everyone to use SegWit. I have no idea where we could be in one month, but I doubt it would be best case 100% SegWit use, was my only point. I'm for SegWit - let's get it done ASAP - but we should be realistic with our expectations. Or, like I say, maybe I'm being pessimistic.
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:59:42
Is it just me who thinks "We are all Satoshi" is a lame proclamation? 
@_date: 2016-10-11 15:07:27
Slightly different. Classic required way, way, way more hashrate to achieve its objectives. Also its momentum was nixed by miners, pool admins and Core reps signing _that_ agreement in HK. You know, the one that suggested we'd all be enjoying the benefits of SegWit long before now.
In fact, my guess is that at least one of those miner/pool admin signatories is allocating a not insignificant amount of hashrate to Ver's new pool. I have no idea where ViaBTC's hashrate comes from, but BTCC has shrunk somewhat...

@_date: 2017-05-08 13:40:11


Hmm, this raises a couple of important points. First, when you do a bit of digging you realise that the devs at Blockstream who "disapprove all proposals" have been remarkably consistent in their opinions on block sizes -- since way before Blockstream existed! It makes sense that they would later reject proposals like XT (a 20M start and a doubling each year or two, IIRC) and ultimately favour a soft fork proposition over a (mostly symbolic) conservative hard fork. Second, users are free to run whatever software they want. If Core devs do not write the software that best reflects what they want, users must look elsewhere (and some do). As best as anyone can tell though, the majority of users seem to want 1M and SegWit. That's the unfortunate truth. If they didn't, we'd see way more support for an alternative client/alternative devs.
I'm a bigger block supporter, btw. Being extremely cautious - suspicious even - in the face of potential dev centralisation and conflicts of interest is the correct response, but vital to take a step back and critically assess conspiracy theories before running with them.
@_date: 2017-05-10 09:10:52
MASF (following an agreement between devs, miners and exchanges to activate SegWit now and if and when blocks get half full, increase the base block size - so a bit like Bitcoin's infamous HK agreement).
@_date: 2015-11-06 12:00:42
People keep posting this because the headline sounds positive -- almost like banks should embrace Bitcoin. In fact, Lagarde is snidely dismissing Bitcoin, essentially saying/implying two things: (1) Bitcoin is and always will be used primarily for Ponzi schemes, fraud, money laundering and other crime; and (2) it will eventually fall away or be banned. Hence banks need not fear it.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:47:47

Do you also think BIP148 currently enjoys the support of the economic majority, just out of interest?

@_date: 2017-05-24 15:30:49
What are you smoking? They want SegWit. So much so that they're willing to back the miners' call for SegWit+2MHF.
Coinbase (and GDAX and other exchanges) is a fantastic bridge between fiat and crypto. They have on-boarded hundreds of thousands if not millions of Bitcoin users. Many of those users go on to use their newly acquired bitcoins for precisely the reasons Bitcoin was invented -- as censorship resistant electronic cash. Maybe they buy drugs, maybe they move money overseas, maybe they HODL. They are Bitcoin users.
Take away all those users and the TXs represented by those companies and Bitcoin has vastly reduced network effects, utility and value.

For what it's worth, I rarely see this narrative from bigger blocks supporters. "Stalled" is used to describe the block size increase debate, not development generally.

Fair point re Coinbase - I'm not from the US and momentarily forgot it was an exchange!  BitPay, on the other hand, at least in its current form, is a stepping stone.  Why would a company hire another company to facilitate its Bitcoin payments when it could set up its own wallet?  BitPay is exactly the sort of intermediary Bitcoin itself does away with (except right now companies aren't confident enough to work with Bitcoin or hold bitcoins - that won't always be the case).  That's all I was trying to say.  I think most people got it.

Pretty sure you can use it to sign transactions for Electrum and a bunch of other wallets/wallet services too.  In any event, best to recognise Trezor for what it is: highly mobile, more convenient means of cold storage.
I highly recommend Airbitz (iOS/Android) btw (though it doesn't yet work with Trezor).  Very secure (all info encrypted on device before being sync'd to P2P git servers -- and look out for their unique 2FA implementation, coming soon), very easy to use and works great as a spending wallet because you can assign payees, notes, etc, to all your transactions (and that info is also encrypted and sync'd).  Added bonus of a built-in directory of local places that accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-18 10:17:54
The price of Bitcoin does not disagree. No one knows if it would be higher or lower if we can-kicked a year ago (but what we do know if that price broadly follows TX volume, and TX volume was increasing until full blocks). This is all moot, of course, we are where we are.
@_date: 2016-10-28 12:49:13
MS doesn't give away Office because each free copy is one less potential sale. That would be the _cost_ to MS of giving away free copies.
There is no equivalent cost for miners. A miner with plenty of free space in his candidate block has nothing to lose by including a low fee TX. It costs him nothing to include the low fee TX because (1) there are no higher fee TXs competing for that space, and no other uses for it, and (2) there's effectively zero cost in building a candidate block with that low fee TX included and hashing that instead.
If miners act rationally, with their own economic interests in mind, they will take those extra fees. It simply isn't viable for all miners on the network to collude to ignore or exclude low fee paying TXs (and this becomes more acute when fees are the only reward). A miner or pool, somewhere, will take the fees, even if others don't.
Very low fee paying TXs might not be relayed by nodes, but that's another matter.
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:13:27
It will survive, even if it ultimately forks away. Some will be too invested to see it die (especially if it takes weeks or months for BIP148 chain to become dominant).

I like your confidence but that momentum shows no real signs of chipping away at the economic majority and hash rate supporting the NY agreement. So I'm still not sure how BIP148 is relevant -- it is only viable if it has the support of that economic majority. That's the point, right? Users and their economic majority _strongly encouraging_ miners to activate SegWit. BIP148 is considerably weaker - impotent, even - without that economic majority support.
In any event, you're right. Potent enough that hands have been revealed. Progress!
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:17:13
What if BIP148 struggles along for a little while but ultimately goes nowhere. Isn't it risky to make/accept SegWit TXs on BIP148 chain during that time?

But everyone knows there will be a base block size increase of some description in the future. LN needs it if it's going to be successful. Getting SegWit done now on some vague promise is a no brainer IMHO. My hope is that that vague promise leads to a genuine effort to formulate a very worthwhile HF (even if that takes a good while longer to carry out -- I think the community will accept that if they see there's genuine work being done) with flex cap and other wish list items.

25c today, $1 tomorrow and before you know it it'll be $10 to achieve the same level of comfort and certainty. That's assuming there's any space left in the next block after the relevant miner or pool is done preselling space. (Or, with LN, that's a $10 fee just to load your prepaid Bitcoin card).
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:56:44
Caution is stop trading during the relevant period and HODL coins on both chains. Not remotely dangerous.
Supporting BIP148 helps it in a situation where, currently, it seems to have very little of the support it needs.
I'm taking a wait and see approach.
@_date: 2015-03-16 09:44:30
It sounds to me like he would want to move bitcoins on and off the exchange fairly frequently.  In which case, unless it's a very large amount (that means different things to different people), I say use Airbitz (iOS, Android).  Very easy to use, very secure.
For very large amounts, use cold storage (Raspberry Pi is perfect, or maybe a Trezor or similar -- but then you have to trust prop hardware).
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:06:58
Maybe although right now BIP148 has very little support. If that remains true come 1 Aug, it will be up to the 148ers to give up their split. Everyone else will happily carry on ignoring them. They have zero chance of obliterating anything.
I'd need to see at least a hint that major exchanges and businesses were ready to get on-board before running BIP148 or risking coins in BIP148 SegWit TXs (something of a chicken and egg problem I suppose).
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:28:39
Lightning is not production ready anywhere, even on Litecoin where SegWit is activated. How long do you think a BIP148 chainsplit can continue for?
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:17:14
You're assuming he cares about ASICBoost, which is a pretty big assumption (and does not explain the rest of the non-SegWit-signalling hash rate). It would be nice to see (Bitmain changing its stance on SegWit), but I suspect their stated reason - that they want a HF base block size increase too - will remain.

Crikey. He looks so happy on Insta.
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:39:20
Hmm, I agree - and I think he now must release something more if he wants to be believed - but I do kind of see the logic in what was done. No one was going to accept a single signed message -- imagine Peter Todd's reaction: "keys were compromised". So maybe, rightly or wrongly, Wright decided to prove beyond doubt to a broad range of Bitcoin people instead. Some declined to be involved (Andreas A, for example), but those that did really are quite varied. Ian G, highly respected cryptographer. Jon M firmly in the small block camp, very active in the community, Gavin A, arguably the person who knew Satoshi and Satoshi's style best. (I'm not saying all this is true, but I can see the logic. Wright's blog post doesn't say anything about offering public proof, so the reaction on that front doesn't necessarily mean anything.)
Anyway, we should find out soon. Either he signs something everyone can verify or he doesn't. If he doesn't, no one will believe him. If he does, only a bunch of people won't believe him. ;)
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:27:15
Just to be clear, he does not. 95% is a really, really high barrier. Wu and Ver could throw their weight behind SegWit and there's still a good chance it wouldn't get anywhere near 95%. Obviously I'd like to see them do that and be proven wrong. :)
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:55:49
Agree, and maybe if those companies quickly shed users - in their millions! - then we'd see a movement away from the NY agreement and towards BIP148 for sure.
No sign of that yet though and let's be honest for a second -- those _millions_ of users likely know very little about the scaling debate. It's unrealistic to expect those companies to lose any significant number of those users as a result of their stance in the scaling debate. Call it user apathy, but it is what it is.
@_date: 2017-05-24 10:39:41
Not everyone wants to use a C++ implementation, let alone Core's full reference implementation. There's plenty of scope for introducing new implementations that don't break consensus.

@_date: 2016-10-20 10:17:00
Right, and RBF may be a good short term solution for some... until everyone's wallet features RBF and recommended RBF settings. People will still miss out and transactions will still get stuck, because RBF does not _create space_ (or at least fees have to reach a point where people are permanently priced out first).
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:45:00
It's no secret.


If this is purely to defeat UASF, well, it's just about the biggest waste of funds and reputation ever. All Purse and BitPay had to do was _not support BIP148_, which is exactly the stance being currently taken by virtually all the major Bitcoin businesses, exchanges and miners.

Tough to observe the full dynamics of fees, however, if you purposefully shoot for permanently full blocks / block space scarcity / high fees.
With any luck we'll see L2 take the bulk of very small, very frequent TXs "off-chain" and Bitcoin's rising price will continue to more than make up for block reward reductions.
@_date: 2016-05-24 13:55:02
With the best will in the world, SegWit can not start now. It is being reviewed, it will eventually be "released" (in a new version of Core) and then miners will need to upgrade and activate (a process which usually takes weeks or months). I wouldn't be confident it could be activated before the halving in July even under normal circumstances. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:39:01
Not sure what you mean when you say, "how could we prevent antpool to not just precreate a block, full of own transactions"? Are you suggesting that's what they're doing with their full blocks?
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:35:56


I know there has been some debate about what was signed, but I think this is possibly wishful thinking on your part. (Were you involved?) It seems pretty clear now that the intention was SegWit+2MHF i.e. committing now to a HF in x months, not just "SegWit now and then let's work towards a HF". That was the entire point of the compromise, the thing that seemingly got everyone on board.


With nominal users and economic activity, and even less hash rate, the best BIP148 can achieve is a permanent split. To be a _success_, it needs to bring everyone across, no?
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:50:35
By "the miners immediately broke", you mean a single pool, F2Pool, mined or signaled a single Classic block but quickly corrected and otherwise upheld all of the terms of the agreement? And by "devs... upheld all of the terms" you mean Luke-Jr's last minute (and with zero support from the other devs present) and truly absurd block size decrease proposition that wasn't in any way, shape or form in the spirit of the agreement?
Neither side is in the clear on that. It was all very poorly handled. It did, however, stop Classic in its tracks, so you should be grateful for that, I suppose.
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:54:36
Not for me to argue for them - I didn't sign the agreement, nor was I ever going to be asked - but they _already have_ the support they need, assuming the agreement holds -- economic and hash rate. It doesn't matter if _other people_ are _even less likely_ to support them. Replay and wipeout arguably not important in the context of the economic majority and the hash rate moving together. (Or if it is, maybe they rush in more changes when needed, I don't know.) Have there been replay and wipeout PRs that have been rejected already?
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:26:58
And what chance of that when virtually all the economic activity is represented by the companies who signed up to the new agreement?
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:26:47
Isn't the change simply due to there being more than one EC implementation?
(Not a BU/EC supporter, just pointing out the obvious.)

He mulls a state sponsored 51% attack that prompts a 50,000 block reorg(!), no less, as if we'd all shrug and follow along. Or the Chinese gov co-opting 51% of the hash rate (and presumably orphaning blocks that contain TXs they don't like? It isn't clear). These sort of attacks seem unlikely in the extreme -- certainly not something that makes "immutability based on proof-of-work [a] commercial, legal and regulatory non-starter". They should rank alongside EMP attacks on critical infrastructure in big corps' risk profiles. I wonder how many years before corps and banks promote Bitcoin above "commercial, legal and regulatory non-starter" status? (Too many; too late for them.)

You need miners to extend a fork branch, so in that sense they do decide. Other users may or may not follow, of course.
For something as trivial as a conservative block size bump, I'm not convinced the majority of users wouldn't follow the hash rate (if the hash rate announced, for example, that it would create bigger blocks on and from date x -- not that I think they'd do that, but still). Bitcoin's extraordinarily high hash rate is a unique feature that sets it apart from alts after all.

@_date: 2015-10-03 17:12:48
Disagree. These concerns are overblown. If a bank can't KYC, or it is at all suspicious of the transaction, it simply will not send the bitcoins (or it receives bitcoins from an unknown source, it will seize them). There should be no need to reverse a transaction (and in any event, transactions today are only "reversed" by the banks on both sides of the transaction and any correspondent banks agreeing; this is the same thing as one bank asking the other to return bitcoins paid in error, for example). On the last point (I assume you mean "seize funds"), if a bank is using Bitcoin as a payment rail i.e. it is sending and receiving bitcoins, what makes you think it can't seize them?

They want more capacity than SegWit offers. It is what it is. Some sort of split was inevitable after years of deadlock -- on the pro-SegWit-only side, BIP148 threatens a split, and now on the more-than-SegWit side, this plan threatens a split. I guess everyone wants a split.

Poor choice of words. My point was only that whereas Bitcoin chugs along and seems invincible, it almost certainly isn't. We shouldn't take it for granted.

Bitcoin can massively reduce these inefficiencies but only where the original bank knows and trusts the final destination bank.  If they don't, they won't send funds directly and you are back to square one (i.e. using multiple banks to get the bitcoins to the final destination bank).

If you mean users could band together and fund a mining operation to block soft fork activation, I guess you're right!
Or I suppose users could collectively reject a soft fork by hard forking away from the hashrate, but that'd be a nuclear option where users necessarily give up the entire security of the network.
Or is there some other way users could reject, for example, the SegWit soft fork? (I don't know why they'd want to!)

Agree, but I can't help but think that if his first move had been to sign a message publicly or move coins, the response would have been "keys compromised" or "he must have known Satoshi". Heck, there were articles written saying as much weeks ago, when rumours first starting circulating. 
He would have needed to do both - use keys and convince people like Gavin A - either way.
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:29:51
Bitcoin is still fragile, believe it or not. So the question is: if your experiment with testing users' appetite for block space scarcity and everything that comes with it (fee pressure and unpredictable confirmation) goes wrong, and people start leaving en masse / Bitcoin's network effects effectively migrate to an alternative, how quickly can the ecosystem react? Who decides how many people leaving is too many? Who decides how and when to adjust the block size. In short, a minefield and something that was never envisaged for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:20:41
It's really difficult to reward nodes and even if you could think of a Sybil resistant plan, all you achieve is a reduction in hash rate (i.e. an overall reduction in the reward miners receive).

@_date: 2016-10-11 20:53:57
I'm confused. You seem to want no main chain growth and inordinately large main chain fees (since you don't want to rely on adoption or rising price). The main chain then becomes the preserve of the 1%, corporates and governments - the only people willing to pay those fees. At that point, it's over. They control Bitcoin and, by extension, everything built on top. Why would anyone else want to run a full node on their mobile phone (not impossible with 5G and beyond!) if they themselves are priced out? It doesn't add up.
That said, right now blocks are full and fees are not going up. So maybe no one is willing to pay more and we'll never realise your chain-for-the-1% scenario. ;)

We don't have a testnet _with committed value on the line_. Key difference. Litecoin is a live money-at-risk environment for SegWit and the tech advances that follow it.
People used to say that Bitcoin would simply copy any decent tech from alts -- clearly that assumption might not be correct. Other coins have features that Bitcoin does not and may never have. With Litecoin, that may well be SegWit and SegWit dependent techs. Can we say for sure it won't?
And now people don't need to get BTC to get LTC.
I don't hold any LTC BTW, and I agree there's a lot of speculation and associated pumping going on.
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:24:54
They have been remarkably consistent with their "we will accept SegWit but we also want a HF increase" to be fair, since Feb 2016 at least. Of course they ask for different HFs in the hope of one being accepted -- that's consistent with their position.
The truth is no one has any real reason to suspect Bitmain and other miners won't accept SegWit as part of a SW+HF package.
@_date: 2016-05-30 20:08:02
Hardly. There are still two distinct trains of thought:
- Core*, which seemingly wants to restrict block size growth at all costs (except for SegWit).
- Bigger block supporters, who want to see the block size increase as naturally as possible as one means of helping Bitcoin scale.
This debate will continue long after "SegWit first", assuming we see SegWit first.
*By Core, I of course mean the most influential among the Core developers and contributors i.e. everyone at Blockstream.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:46:52

I don't know -- and it's useful to point to and query the instances where they mine non full blocks after 30secs or in some cases minutes (3-4 in every 100 last time I checked), but 4 seconds? BTCC does the same thing, as do other pools/miners.

You still manage to assume that the UASF chain will have _user_ support, which is far from clear at the moment. Especially with _companies representing the vast majority of users and economic activity_ apparently signing up for something else.
Still, a lot can happen in a month or two.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:52:48
Not convinced. Very real danger of bluffs being called on both sides. I wouldn't be surprised to see some folks behind a failed BIP148 UASF double down by forking away with a change to PoW. They'll still have legacy coins anyway (if they didn't sell).

I think he's saying they've filed the patents but aren't oblige to make the precise details public for 18 months or so. I have no idea if that is true (in terms of patent filing/granting procedure).
FWIW Greg M's response could not be clearer: "Blockstream does not have any patents, patent applications, provisional patent applications, or anything similar, related to segwit."
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:45:12
They asked a lot of questions, clearly some of them were starting with near zero background knowledge (a few Google searches at best - I heard a few references to BitCom and MtGox controlling a percentage of BitCom, whatever that means). Lots of confusion as to what Bitcoin is, where bitcoins come from, why have they value and what an exchange is.
On the plus side, the people testifying were solid and (at the request of the panel) not reading scripts (although the Ziftr guy sounded a little like a walking ad initially). Jerry Brito answered the bulk of the questions early on, did a good job. Coin Center made his written submission available online a few hours ago (though obviously this has little to do with his oral testimony).
Credit the NJ lawmakers for holding the hearings, because they certainly have a lot to think about/try to wrap their heads around.

On the flip side they already have the economic majority and most of the hash rate - far from ideal but BIP148 has seemingly forced some hands and if those two things combined (economic activity, hash rate) can't rally to change Bitcoin in an 8 week period, I don't know what can.

Other than specifically relating to raising the block size limit, who is saying that? Gavin isn't, unless I missed it. Link? If anything he's opining that the Core devs are working too hard on overly complicated solutions.

That's an absurd stance. If BIP148 UASF goes badly, people on that chain risk losing funds. Not because they didn't run a full node; just because the UASF failed miserably.
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:48:58
As a _conservative_ bigger blocker (I, perhaps selfishly, want bigger blocks but not so big that I can't run a node on my better than average connection at home), it's sad to see the bigger block cause so heavily diluted.

Agree with the point you are making - don't trust, verify - but it isn't necessarily _safe_ to use an always online PC node as your main wallet.
What is your recommended setup nowadays?
The ideal is probably a hardware wallet (cold storage) and a mobile wallet (spending), both of which query your own full node, but I'm not sure that's possible yet (and if it is it's a pretty advanced setup). Still waiting for some nice all-in-one consumer product + app that covers this.

This is weird. Too bad because this isn't like Grigg at all.
I get that signing messages or moving coins is not conclusive proof of identity. I rather thought that was the point of convincing Gavin A and others. But the apparent refusal to publicly release at least the type of signed message that Gavin was able to verify (or thought he was able to verify) only casts doubt. Wright has achieved nothing more than portraying himself as a fraud and damaging the reputations of Gavin A, Jon Matonis, Ian Grigg and JVP. Truly bizarre. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:11:37
That won't double the max block size in one month from now, but yeah, SegWit certainly seems like the easiest/best/obvious move short term.

Who, bigger block supporters? True that they wanted HF first but there's also a fear that the most influential Core devs want a permanently restricted block size. SegWit first doesn't settle the debate. I suppose flex cap or (heaven forbid) no limit at all would be some people's preference.

Yes but SegWit alone is up to 4M blocks with approximately 2M of that being data padding compared to a 4M block size increase... so security clearly is not that much of an issue.
Edit: I was conflating weight and total size, so this is nonsense. Although it remains an attack vector.
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:42:18
A few points.
First, Bitmain's interest is also _long term_. It's not your average miner, it's an ASIC market leader. So the incentives are slightly different (arguably stronger!).
Second, you assume active use of covert ASICBoost, despite no evidence and none of the other miners complaining (are they all running covert ASICBoost?). Whatever the case, we'll have a better idea of what is and what is not going on in 2 weeks (when SegWit2x is released). If Bitmain runs SegWit2x, the covert ASICBoost argument goes out of the window. If they don't, it'll be v suspicious. Let's wait and see. Not long now.
Third, miners are a crucial part of the network... but that's the extent of their "power". They know full well they can't change the rules without the sanction of users (which, with SegWit2x, they arguably have). On the flip side, you and most other users are running software that says, "only allow SegWit if 95% of miners agree". They don't agree (they want an instant, predictable block size increase as a priority). If you want to change the condition so that miner sanction is not part of the decision, go ahead, get it merged! Either way, SegWit2x does not give miners any more power than they already have (unlike BU which arguably delegated block size decisions to miners).

There's every reason. Bitcoin is orders of magnitude more secure and much more resilient. Shareholders must trust Nasdaq to administer the private chain properly. They must trust Nasdaq to secure the private chain, to ensure its up time and to intervene promptly should anything go wrong. Who is validating each tx? Nasdaq, presumably.
Looking further ahead, it will make more sense to use Bitcoin and side chains because there will be a supremely secure thread tying all trading together (Bitcoin and bitcoins). Just IMO, of course, but I see this and most private chain initiatives as (welcome) baby steps towards decentralisation.

Well, this is _not_ BU or Bitmain or Ver related. And those weren't really XT or Classic related. The "more on-chain now please, off-chain as and when it's ready" crowd is perhaps bigger and more varied than you think.
We also have traditional small blockers / Core / SegWit supporters seeking out potential alternatives to Core in the face of the SegWit impasse (i.e. the apparent inability to achieve consensus for the scaling proposal that Core put forward, and the apparent unwillingness of Core to consider or code alternative solutions). I wouldn't call it "people switching sides", rather it's simple pragmatism; a desire to try something other than sit-around-and-hope-everyone-gets-on-board-with-SegWit. I don't blame them -- we're at an impasse and the most likely way forward seems to be a controversial and potentially quite painful USAF or BIP8 SegWit push.
Point being that we need not consider these _attacks_ by _attackers_ that need to be _shot down_. They're just Bitcoin people looking for ways to move forward. The longer the impasse, the more alternatives that will pop up.
On the flip side, nChain seems to be Craig Wright related and is therefore a scam. Which makes it an interesting test for the "more on-chain now please" crowd -- if they release a viable product, dare they support it?

One demand. The same demand throughout. A base block size instant capacity increase.
You picked dishonesty, which is fine. The miners picked dishonesty too, on the part of Core (or at least intense suspicion around the refusal to work on a base block size increase, and all the hard fork FUD that has gone with it).
Anyway, we know all this. Hence we are where we are, racing towards... something... which will happen in July/August. Never a dull moment in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-19 13:59:22
If SegWit doesn't activate, it will be because a not insignificant part of the community considers it _controversial_. It's fine to not like that.
FWIW, I think we should get on with activating SegWit too. I had hoped we'd dispel the whole "hard forks are to be avoided at all costs" thing, because it's silly, but we are where we are and SegWit is finally here.

Because it's supposed to be a compromise. One side supposedly wants SegWit only, the other side has a strong preference for a hard fork increase. Neither side was about to get its own way any time soon, hence the push to compromise -- SegWit plus a feature minimal hard fork.

@_date: 2017-07-02 09:45:11
What control? They have shown they _need_ the support of the economic majority. Heck even BU/Emergent Consensus requires _users_ to indicate what they're willing to accept. The miners are clearly unhappy with Core but maybe that's because they've been asking for hard fork increase code _for years_ and have been largely ignored (except when a few Core devs rushed to HK to stop them running Classic -- which, ironically, was done with a promise to do SegWit+2MHF).
@_date: 2017-07-12 07:24:52
My point was not that 4M blocks stuffed with data can/will be the norm, rather that the extra space is unusable for TXs when comparing SegWit with a block size increase. (Edit: not true, I was conflating weight and total size, though the attack vector remains).
That said, things like Confidential Transactions(!) require lots of witness space and I would think people would happily pay the discounted fee rate for those.
On average block size alone, I think you're _probably_ right; I roll my eyes at "oh noes SegWit8x 8M blocks" for the same reason.
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:06:32
BIP91 is one side of SegWit2x -- the bit that activates SegWit. The bit that activates 2x (the hard fork) is the other side.

Presumably he means lifting the block size limit as and when required, which is what we've been doing (albeit soft limits enforced by miners) for years. But yes, agree that a hard fork is obvs an altering of Bitcoin.

You can't state that as fact. SegWit as implemented requires 95% miner support. Bitmain could throw its full weight behind SegWit tomorrow and it would achieve 95% miner support, not even close.

Soft limits were enforced by miners (not creating blocks larger than eg 250kb) and each time the soft limit was hit, it was raised. The 1M limit is different because raising it requires a hard fork.

Practical fungibility is one thing, legal is another. Dollars are legally fungible. Depending on WTF bitcoins are, legally speaking, they may or may not be fungible (but they certainly have not been declared to be legally fungible in any jurisdiction, AFAIK). Legal fungibility is important when it comes to things like A trying to claim stolen bitcoins back from a third party recipient C (putting aside, for a second, the difficulty in identifying C). Genuinely unresolved (legal) questions.

Yes. Import the private key into any wallet that allows the importing of private keys. Mycelium, for example.

Start QT, offline if you like, and then use the debug console to extract the relevant private key(s) (Google for instructions - I think these still work:  You can then import those private keys into e.g. a mobile wallet (something like breadwallet), then send the coins to your preferred online wallet.

Does it? It hasn't actually achieved the level of support required by the code that most people run. The requirement for SegWit activation was very clearly "if 95% of miners agree". My Core node will not accept SegWit TXs before that condition is met. That hasn't happened, sorry. If you want to test support for a SegWit activation flag day that doesn't require miner buy-in, great, write a BIP for that, get it merged and see if people run it. Or just stop calling these things "attacks".

Bigger block supporters are deeply suspicious - particularly after the HK agreement - that hard fork increases will be delayed forever, crushing Bitcoin's network effects. It seems pretty obvious that going the SegWit-only-for-now path will lead to years and years of f excuses _not to HF_ -- it'll be "no, we have to give SegWit more time" and "we need to give Schnorr sigs time" and then "we need to realise the full benefits of Lightning" and "we've not realised the benefits of MAST yet", etc. SegWit-only-for-now has been rejected. SegWit2x - which looks a lot like that HK agreement from nearly a year and a half ago - has seemingly been accepted by miners and an econ majority (WTF are you smoking thinking BIP148 has an economic majority behind it? LOL). July 21, not long now.
(No need to respond -- you've slipped into obnoxious and I'm done for the night anyway.)

8M blocks would be 8M of witness data and 0M of non-witness. I'm not sure anyone would pay any attention to such a block. And fees would still be payable (they were before full blocks(!), and the attack you describe would involve full blocks, and if it were an attack, you'd need a number of them, consecutively).
Do we really think that _highly unlikely to ever be used_ 8M limit will cause problems? My home node could handle _actual_ 8M blocks anyway and none of the businesses and miners supporting 2x seem too concerned.

That's a shame. (Genuinely.) Seems odd to walk away from it all on the basis that a small number of users couldn't force the network to upgrade to SegWit by a particular date or without certain conditions attached.

More likely they genuinely believe that sufficient decentalisation can exist even if running a node at home becomes impractical.

To be fair, their deal represents way, way, way, way, way more users/economic activity than we are seeing (so far) behind UASF. UASF needs that support. On the flip side, they could opt for BIP148 to get the SegWit part of their deal done.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:50:31
The conservative plan would be to HODL both. There's no way I'd risk coins on UASF chain until it's locked in. Even then, those heavily invested in or otherwise committed to the legacy chain would likely fork to invalidate the BIP148 chain and enforce a permanent split -- no one knows which coins would be more valuable long term.

Correct. If one of those payment methods is available to you for a particular transaction, you should absolutely use it. It makes no sense to use Bitcoin. Heck, with you may even get something back with your credit card (points, air miles, whatever).
If those methods are not available or are too expensive - maybe it's a cross border transaction or you're buying something you shouldn't or you don't want the purchase to show up on your statement for whatever, then by all means pay the premium to use Bitcoin.
It sucks that Bitcoin is expensive nowadays, but it's not ludicrously so (for what it is) and there's a good chance fees will come down in future.

This is speculation -- and SegWit only disables _covert_ ASICBoost, which means Bitmain could go along with SegWit (which they seem to be doing anyway with SegWit2x -- we'll know for sure in two weeks' time) and still use ASICBoost.
Maybe the plausible explanation is they genuinely want a block size increase and don't trust Core to actually provide the capacity that Bitcoin's _network effects_ need, and that SegWit-only-for-now is dangerously insufficient?


SegWit2x was concocted by Core devs and Adam Back in Hong Kong last year. I agree that there may be an element of saving face -- that's rather the point of a "compromise", both "sides" giving in a little. That's surely why Barry Silbert pushed for this particular deal. Also, you could assume _good faith_ for a change -- after all, the SegWit2x code was _amended_, with the help of a Core dev btw, to help avoid a BIP148 chain split. The SegWit2x devs (and participants, who have next to no time to actually implement SegWit2x to meet the new timetable) have actually gone/will go out of their way to achieve this!


It might look that way but what actually happened was Core and all its supporters opted to run software that says, "activate SegWit if and only if 95% of the hash rate is on-board". Miners had already indicated they would do no such thing _before SegWit was even coded_! Miners can run whatever software they want.


Rest assured there are many, many software engineers working hard to implement SegWit2x on time and avoid that BIP148 chain split. (And some of those engineers are Core devs who have actually contributed.) God speed, I say.
@_date: 2017-07-12 08:54:42
You misunderstand. I don't mean padding in the literal sense. I mean there can be 4M blocks that only have the equivalent of 2M of (today's) TXs in there (cf a normal block size increase where a 4M block would have 4M of (today's) TXs in there). That's what weighting does. If that were not the case, why would we not have 4M of TXs in a SegWit block? Also SegWit TXs are slightly bigger than normal TXs FYI.

The only thing the miners have done is _not_ activate SegWit. Their reasoning (if you believe it -- but they have been consistent) is that they want to see actual (instantly available, predictable) block size increase as a priority.
They have _not_ forced anything upon anyone and in fact it was _the economic majority_ represented by Bitcoin businesses that have allowed for the SegWit2x push -- the miners simply didn't and wouldn't do it or their own.
At the same time you have a BIP148 initiative which threatens (worst case) untold damage on users who run Bitcoin Core(!!).
Right is left and up is down.
Edit: I should say, it SegWit2x turns out to be a bust and their timeline slips because of the actions of miners, I can see a not insignificant amount of support switch to BIP148, which I would not be against.

This bit is potentially very tricky (and maybe, ultimately, we need two or more coins to fight it out to see what makes the most sense). There is a scale; on one end (far left of the scale), millions of nodes all running on Raspberry Pis and dial-up internet -- maximum decentralisation but highly constrained; on the opposite end (far right), a handful of mega-nodes run by highly regulated entities -- entirely centralised but all encompassing. We are already some way from the far left, and that's absolutely fine. There are people that do not have the option of running fully validating nodes for various reasons; they necessarily rely on others running validating nodes. Maybe it's because they only have dial-up. Now, how far along the scale can we go before centralisation becomes a real issue (it becomes a real issue when full nodes that non-node users rely on can be pressured/compromised, at which point censorship resistance is lost). Is the line really drawn at "average home connection and Raspberry Pi"? Or "fast home connection and average PC"? Or is it "fiber optic home connection and server/very powerful PC"? I want to be able to run a node at home but I have money and a great home connection -- nevertheless, am I being selfish? Should the line actually be drawn at "very fast connection and business/enterprise server"? &lt;-- That is still a long, long way from the far right of the scale, so arguably sufficiently decentralised for the purposes of censorship resistance, not least because we're talking about businesses (that necessarily rely on nodes) and hobbyists with resources _globally_. I don't know what the answer is, but it seems to me that some of the "PayPal 2.0" claims are overblown, since no one is talking about going straight to GB blocks or even putting nodes beyond the reach of average businesses. And all this ignores actual tech advances too. Ultimately, we may look back and find that being overly conservative, and restricting Bitcoin's network effects, actually killed the goose that laid the golden eggs.


Ver was relatively late to the scaling debate party. He didn't get involved until _after_ theymos made his move. Similarly, Jihan Wu and Bitmain were "just miners" at that point, not "evil dictators out to destroy Bitcoin". I would argue that at the very least there has been an extremely effective campaign run by "the other side", whoever that is; anyone who has opposed - or even questioned! - Core's vision for Bitcoin has been systematically forced out/smeared/subjected to death-by-troll attacks, one by one.

Yes, part of the economic incentive Satoshi put in place to secure the network. You now have a problem with that?
If devs or users want SegWit to activate, they need to either get miners on-board (which SegWit2x does) or they need to run software that does not say, "activate SegWit if 95% of the hash rate agrees".


Bitmain's monopoly is over new ASIC production, not overall hash rate. Bitmain's concern should be maintaining that monopoly. WTF would Bitmain have to gain by also controlling a majority of the hash rate? Another element of Satoshi's economic incentive: take too much control and you damage the credibility of the entire system and thus the price of bitcoins and thus your own financial status and outlook.
(BTW, I agree with the more general point: any and all forms of centralisation are bad, including ASIC manufacturing, geographical location and dev influence.)

Congrats. I still remember my first time. If you can, find something to buy. It needn't be big or interfere with your goal of saving. It's just another next step in getting comfortable with Bitcoin. I've used Bitcoin to buy a bunch of things -- from tech stores mostly, purse.io for Amazon purchases, Steam, VPN access, that sort of thing. My experience has always been great. BitPay's payment processing layer (the one most Bitcoin accepting online stores use) has been particularly good - very satisfying to see your payment instantly acknowledged, and to know that you've just transmitted value directly (albeit to BitPay in this example), possibly cross-border, almost instantly and with a minimal fee. It's quite an eye-opener.

Good morning!


Very few don't want LN, MAST, etc too, they just don't know why the fuck we can't execute a simple can kick hard fork too, since that will take the pressure off immediately, unlike SegWit.


Core did this and you (I assume you run/ran a Core full node) sanctioned this by actually running that software. It's inexplicable that Core and you thought 95% of the hash rate would subscribe to SegWit-only-for-now -- they told you at the time, before SegWit was coded, and you didn't listen. So pat yourself on the back for that one.


Miners don't move without significant econ support. That support has signed up for a hard fork in November, assuming the SegWit2x timeline sticks. So you'll have to wait a while longer, sorry (unless you get lucky and SegWit2x doesn't happen before 1 Aug, in which case you can join Luke-Jr and the other BIP148ers when they quietly eject themselves from the network).

The danger is that at precisely the time we need Bitcoin to perform and prove itself - as adoption kicks in - it will fail (transactions won't get processed or the fees required will be too high -- people will think WTF?, laugh and move on).  We will have sacrificed actual adoption(!) simply to stress test the system.
Increasing the block size isn't something that can take place overnight either.  If adoption happens and we hit that 1MB limit hard, it'll still be months before the increase can be effected (if at all, given that miners may get a taste for artificially inflated fees).

Are you absolutely sure the best path for Bitcoin is/was the path we took? You're positive that Core's inability to activate any scaling solution whatsoever in 4+ years was _good for Bitcoin_?
Are you sure pushing SegWit (despite immediate complaints from a broad section of the community when the idea was first announced to the public) and applying the ridiculous 95% miner threshold (also pointed out as being hugely unrealistic at the time) was "the best idea"?
I don't know how far back you go, but there was a time before this community divide and before rbtc, when Bitcoin users celebrated and supported Bitcoin businesses and use cases. This difference between now and then is stark to say the least. Or maybe this was all inevitable, sooner or later, given the structure of Core and the heavy reliance placed on it by miners, businesses and users.
In any event, BIP148 and SegWit2x will force the issue, one way or another. Hopefully Core can be a bit more progressive and dynamic once it becomes unstuck.

I'm not convinced 8M = less full nodes. Any hobbyist with a good connection can run an 8M node, and if 8M blocks were actually full of TXs, that would mean very significant usage; at that level it's very likely that more businesses would run their own full nodes. 10,000 full node running businesses and it's already more decentralised than current Bitcoin.
There are already people right now that can't run a full node (or choose not to). Is Bitcoin centralised because of that? Of course not. So if that's not the line, where is it? 2-3M SegWit? (Rhetorical because no one knows, no in-depth research has been done.)
(I don't support BCC btw.)

The miners were always in favour of bigger blocks via HF, save that they baulked at XT's 20M. 8M was broadly agreed among miners/pools ( (I even recall Samson Mow being in favour!), then 4M (after the research that showed 4M was the max safe limit at the time), then 2M and Classic. The miners never stood against any of those options; it was Core and anti-HF people.
SegWit was a complete switcheroo that none of the miners or bigger block supporters expected; given the consistent (and at the time inexplicable) refusal of Core to sanction a HF up to that point, suspicions were raised and miners dug their heels in and continued to insist on a HF. The HK agreement was an effort to prevent a Classic 2M HF; miners accepted SegWit on the basis they would have HF code in a release of Core.
Amazing how different our recollections are on this.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:49:12
Nope, they have been exploring alternatives for a while, whilst still supporting SegWit.
Ext blocks for example. Yet always and still anti BU/EC.
Bottom line for them, SegWit is starting to look like too little, too late in capacity terms (regardless of who is to blame for that lateness!).

The shoe is on the other foot. Lots of users wanted a hard fork increase _years ago_, even before SegWit-via-SF was a thing. They didn't get it. They didn't then go ahead and cause a chain split or fork, which seems to be the intention of the most butt-hurt BIP148 pusher. BIP149, sure. 148 seems overly optimistic and overly aggressive IMHO.
FWIW, I don't know how else one goes about gaining the support of the econ majority that BIP148 requires, but this whole grassroots-not-supported-by-Core thing doesn't seem to be working.

@_date: 2017-07-15 07:01:56
It's an 8M _weight_ limit though, right? Meaning (a) 8M blocks are as likely as 4M blocks under plain old SegWit (not very), (b) more likely we'll see a max of ~4M (2M under SegWit), and (c) it'll be subject to the same SegWit slow growth conditions (i.e. that max requires 100% adoption, so won't be possible for quite some time if at all).
@_date: 2017-05-10 11:25:24
Vote with your feet. Use something else. _Enough people leaving_ is the only way to shake up the status quo. Unfortunately, enough people see Bitcoin as a "luxury product" that they're willing to test your resolve and the resolve of people like you (i.e. your willingness to pay high fees). They're all HODLers who grabbed a bunch of bitcoins early on, so they don't care about high fees. If, on the other hand, Bitcoin loses its users and network effects to other cryptos, demand falls, fees fall and (crucially) value falls, maybe then they sit up and take notice.

Seriously. Bitcoin Core client users certainly won't consider it an attack. In fact, no one will, except for the few BIP148 nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-10 12:07:10
I understand that blocks are larger post SegWit, but perhaps you or someone else can confirm/clarify/correct my (limited) understanding:
- Currently, witness data is stored alongside each TX in a block -- so (at the risk of oversimplifying) a block with 3 TXs looks like: [TX1,witness1][TX2,witness2][TX3,witness3]
- SegWit blocks are structured differently such that witness data _within the block_ is moved to the end of the block, so a 3 TX block where all TXs=SegWit looks like: [TX1][TX2][TX3][witness1][witness2][witness3] and a 3 TX block where TX2=legacy looks like [TX1][TX2,witness2][TX3][witness1][witness3]
- Legacy nodes would only "see" [TX1][TX2][TX3] or [TX1][TX2,witness2][TX3] in the examples above; they'd ignore the SegWit witness sections at the end of the blocks i.e. [witness1][witness2][witness3] or [witness1][witness3], respectively.
- Taking the above example with one legacy TX, [TX1][TX2,witness2][TX3] (the base) must be &lt;1MB to maintain backwards compatibility. Is the weight rule sufficient to ensure blocks can't be constructed with a base size &gt;1MB, since it's base*3+total and total is always &gt;= base? Or are blocks actually measured against max block base size as well? Maybe this is where some of the confusion lies.
Also, I think you said current data suggests 2.4MB blocks (the equivalent of) are possible with full SegWit adoption. What are the numbers, roughly, for such a block (what is base size and total size)?
@_date: 2017-07-09 23:12:26
Agree with all that, but equally saying "SegWit increases the block size to 2MB" or "SegWit is a 2MB increase" (for example) isn't entirely honest/correct either. Heck it may never be 2MB because we may never see 100% SegWit TXs in blocks (though obviously other SegWit dependent upgrades will get us that and more, eventually).
Maybe that slow SegWit adoption will make 2x easier to swallow. ;)
@_date: 2017-07-04 10:46:43
Yes, I agree that if the SegWit2x timetable holds, then SegWit will achieve the level of support required by the code that most people run.
Then we can all relax until the looming hard fork in November.
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:31:39




A chain split, wherein all but the BIP148 nodes consider both the BIP148 chain and the "legacy" chain to be valid (and will follow the longest chain, whatever that may be).


I doubt there are more than 100 BIP148ers total, on here and on Twitter. They just happen to be loud and have a lot of free time. They also claim to have the support of all SegWit supporters, which is patently absurd. In all likelihood, ignoring SegWit2x for a second, BIP148ers would eject themselves from the network on 1 Aug and quickly give up. SegWit2x obviously changes things, seeking to activate SegWit and avoid any BIP148 created chain split. I have no idea why people support BIP148. Impatience? Maybe a genuine desire to see Bitcoin split? Maybe they want to mine again (and see this as the best way of creating a new coin with a PoW change)? Luke-Jr insists 1MB blocks are doing harm to Bitcoin yet has dedicated his time to improving BIP148's chances (at best taking it from a non-event to a guaranteed chain split). It's all really odd.


The risk is arguably greater with a chain split, because it adds further uncertainty. No one knows how long it will last or which way it will go. Bitcoin will likely shut down during the chain split period. Worst case, BIP148 starts off with nominal hash rate but survives and eventually takes over, causing a huge reorg on the "legacy" chain (meaning people running Bitcoin Core, no less, and virtually every other client). Query whether Core/other clients will allow their uses to suffer such a reorg -- of course not. So they will hard fork to protect themselves. Kudos BIP148!

In the eyes of the (as yet, seemingly) very small BIP148 minority of nodes and hash rate. You really ought to be more clear about this. In the eyes of all other clients - not least Bitcoin Core - they will be valid blocks. Same with your nonsense "51% attack" labelling of hash rate that continues to serve valid blocks to Bitcoin Core and all the other non-BIP148 nodes.

He has denied it, though many people think it.
And there was that time Satoshi remarked (about a Bitcoin address beginning 1NS...) about the funny coincidence that it started with his initials.
Loosely related, in terms of sheer "coincidence" (which is equally hard to accept), Hal Finney supposedly lived blocks away from Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto's family home.

It is but it's nowhere near 8M and I doubt they want to stop at 8M too. They clearly have very different ideas about on chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:05:33
Strongly disagree. A large swathe of the community shares his opinion re what Bitcoin is and what it should be. You only have to listen to a few of the long running podcasts or attend a few conferences to realise Roger Ver is not alone -- he just happens to be among the most passionate, willing to put his money where his mouth is and, frankly, willing to put up with the constant barrage from boring trolls. That should come as no surprise, of course; few are more invested in Bitcoin (evidence to the contrary required if you're going to insist he's lying) and no one has worked harder over the years to promote _actual Bitcoin adoption_ and grow Bitcoin's crucial _network effects_.
Small blockers seem to want all the benefits brought to them by Bitcoin businesses (not least _actual value_, making Bitcoin a _store of value_ of sorts, and _network effects_) without the businesses themselves! I mean, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills when I read some of the bizarre posts here.
That's not to say I don't recognise some of the concerns. A conservative approach is to be commended, but an _overly_ conservative approach can be (has been?) hugely damaging.
I'm not a Ver fan and I'm certainly not sold on his long term vision, but IMHO he has plenty of _actual users_, people who _actually use Bitcoin on a daily or weekly basis_, on his side. Ultimately, I think he's right when he says the people who wield the most influence over the direction of Core - and the loudest small block supporters - are, unfortunately, the people who use Bitcoin _the least_.
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:48:43


Guess that's for the miners/pools to decide (if you're referring to the HK agreement). Don't they have a meeting coming up with Core reps this week?
@_date: 2016-07-11 11:04:36


And all Bitcoin users use...
So if users see that a miner has awarded itself with bitcoins other than in accordance with the rules they all run, they will ignore that miner's work.


My understanding, unless something has changed: Both new blocks propagate and two branches will (temporarily) exist. The miners will see this -- they will keep both branches but will work atop the one they saw first. When another new block is found, it quickly propagates and settles the argument (ie one branch will now be longer than the other -- all miners adjust to work atop it as the longest valid chain).
Because of the speed of block propagation vs the time it usually takes to find blocks, it's very rare that two or more branches exist. Rarer still that they are both extended by further new blocks found at the same time.

@_date: 2017-07-06 09:36:13
When you say "checks different hashes", do you mean each miner mines within a different nonce range or is something else different in their block headers? I always wondered how many possible outcomes the nonce could provide anyway - I wouldn't have thought a nonce would last that long nowadays, given today's hash rate, but maybe I'm not appreciating the sheer number of possibilities.

On the flip side, the prospect of larger blocks via SegWit or otherwise has undoubtably increased the (speculative) price of bitcoins way beyond the extra fees a miner might have secured with small blocks. Swings and roundabouts.

Marginally. Taken together they don't supply nearly enough capacity. There is no way around the fact that block weight will have to increase in future (essentially a hard fork increase). There will likely by Drivechains too, but they offer a slightly different security model and are not a reason for restricting Bitcoin's natural (main chain) growth.

Banks and CC processors did not invent consumer refunds and chargebacks.  They are forced to implement those policies by consumer protection laws.

No need to sling insults. Save your energy for the big hard fork fight in November. :)
SegWit HF has one rather obvious advantage over SegWit SF. Instant, predictable capacity increase/availability. SegWit SF, being opt-in, is not predictable in any way and the capacity gains by week, month or year are not guaranteed in any way either. Those absurd 1.7M or 2.1M best case scenarios assume _100% uptake_ which, absent a HF,  _may never happen_.
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:36:12
Who's to say what the right answer is though? Who's to say that if we had not can-kicked via a 2M or 4M hard fork _years ago_ that we would not be in a much better state (as a community and in terms of protocol dev) than we are now?
I'm no CSW fan (he's a fraud) and (if I'm honest) most of the very big block advocates have said odd and sometimes contradictory things, but I do have some sympathy with the argument that the line (broadly, node cost) need not be drawn at Raspberry Pi/1MB and that keeping it there - with or without SegWit - is potentially hugely damaging to certain of Bitcoin's oft cited, all important, network effects.
At the same time you have some small blockers declaring that bigger-than-Core-sanctioned-blocks = PayPal, which is intellectually lazy/dishonest. You have to query their motives too.
FWIW, I think people like Ver et al just see another potentially well funded ally (even if they don't agree on all points) against the roadblock (their perception) of 1M/SegWit-only-for-now.

A sad state of affairs -- kudos for making the effort though.
Responses like this, however, seem incredibly disingenuous.
You know those companies weren't pumping Eth a year ago. Nor were companies like BlockCypher, Bitwage, Lamassu and the other traditionally Bitcoin-only companies that now support Eth. They (and many, many others) had been arguing for block size increases long before Classic, but you know that too.

They work on empty candidate blocks (briefly) while they check all the TXs in the most recent block and work out what new TXs they can include. Once validation is done there's no additional cost to switching to hash a candidate block which includes valid TXs. Is my understanding.

Transactions are bundled together and processed in blocks. When you broadcast a transaction to the network, there will necessarily be a short period before that transaction is included in a block (it's first "confirmation"). During that period, the transaction is "pending".
That period can be much longer if the network is busy (lots of transactions) and the fee attached to the transaction is too low. The transaction might not make it into the next block or the next block or indeed any block.
Also some services wait for x confirmations before agreeing that your payment or deposit has been made. They might refer to the transaction as "pending" until x confirmations is reached.
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:55:07
LOL, if BIP148 works as intended, the "leeches" will be with you on the SegWit chain.
It sounds like you'd rather it _didn't work_ -- you want a permanent chain split, with the "leeches" on the other side. You'll probably even argue for a PoW change. Bottom line, you want a _hard fork_ for _marginally bigger blocks_. Kudos.

A better wallet might work today, but only on the basis that there remains a bunch of crap wallets used by other people. Also worth noting that the user might not have had a choice (query how Popper managed to use an old version of blockchain.info, and presumably the "outdated" wallet worked just fine a few months earlier when he loaded it).
Maybe we're using different assumptions too.
With consistent excess demand (my assumption), all or most wallets will resend TXs with larger fees in the hope of getting them included. Throw in RBF and CPFP too. This will continue, quickly, until fees are very high and people leave. (Maybe it's people leaving that becomes one of your "naturally occurring cycles"?)
Fee guessing will be made all the more difficult by eg miners pre-selling block space (meaning lots of seemingly low/zero fee TXs making it into blocks, distorting the picture further).

Do you think Gavin was CIA before Satoshi invented Bitcoin? Or was he turned? Just trying to understand your line of thinking. Then Satoshi "figured it out" but inexplicably left Bitcoin to Gavin, CIA, as sole maintainer? Even more incredible, Gavin,CIA and sole maintainer of Bitcoin, then gave Bitcoin back to the people by sharing commit access -- a monumental fuck up? And now Bitcoin is safe because Gavin, CIA, is unable to raise the block size limit, some sort of last ditch attempt to destroy Bitcoin? Is that roughly what you believe?
Agree Jon is no cryptographer or coder. But Gavin and Ian G really are. I find it very difficult to believe the were tricked... unless Craig "Satoshi" Wright refuses to correct the record by doing the obvious and signing a message from the genesis block address.
Either way, it's all very, very odd. Almost as odd as your Gavin CIA story.

Agree but they do have genuine concerns. They could use LN for example, but a real world application of LN with working routing seems to be years away. Look at Thunder. Is going out of your way in the meantime to avoid a simple, temporary hard fork increase reasonable (which to me at least seems to have been the approach of some very prominent Core devs)? And not for technical reasons or "decentralisation", rather it's economics guess work and wanting to force dev in a particular direction: 
Anyway, they stopped way short of a whiney ragequit. They are still a Bitcoin company.

BIP148 needs to actually acquire the users/economic activity _and_ hash rate that would make it viable, all within roughly the same time frame.

In exactly the same way directors of companies face personal liability, yes. In fact, I'd go further, because banks are special cases (in terms of the role they play in our society), so these principals should apply at virtually every level of management (all the way to the top).
Deferred payments and claw-backs are not enough. Personal fines and jail time.
The faster-than-immediate effect would be extremely tight internal controls and managers actually making carefully considered decisions (i.e. signing-off or not signing-off).
It is so difficult to build cases against individuals at banks because there are no incentives for middle managers to aid the process (by incentive, I mean stick - they are not personally liable) and more often than not there are very clear disincentives (protecting friends, not wanting to open cans of worms, etc).

May or may not be fair but let's remember that there are fierce "small blockers" that were (seemingly still are) convinced. Jon Matonis, JVP. Hard to deny something when you personally have been convinced. Gavin admitted to the possibility of bamboozlement, that's probably as much as he can do.

I think the NYA was a final determination to move on regardless. They figure there's enough support to get on with things even if there are a few stubborn holdouts. When push comes to shove, query what % decide to follow. I suspect those "left behind" will be way, way lower than 20%, and the new chain will be "Bitcoin".
Of course this is Bitcoin, so anything can happen. :)
@_date: 2016-07-27 10:06:17
Nodes generally ignore transactions &gt; 72 hours old (since Core 0.12?). Mempools generally sort by fee and evict (and ignore) the lowest fee paying transactions too. So if your transaction fee is too low, there's a good chance it will disappear after 72 hours. Different wallet implementations handle this in different ways.
It makes for a far from satisfactory UX that will only get worse as wallets get better at guessing fees (ironically -- until we see reduced transaction volume or, dare I say it, a capacity increase of some sort).

You missed the bit where businesses representing virtually all economic activity on the network today also signed up to SegWit2x?
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:29:46
Their own little island or there own Enormous Bitcoin Island Where All The Action Is? (It's really too early to tell IMO.)
Both forks will have SegWit, but the new chain (created in November) will have twice the capacity, cheaper TXs, a vastly superior hash rate and most of the daily economic activity on the network. Worst case (for the legacy chain) is the legacy chain might have to hard fork just to survive.
It might look like miners get too much say with SegWit2x, but it's important to remember the 2x part is only possible because of the support/sanction of users/the economic majority (albeit represented by businesses). That hardly makes anyone "Chain's bitch".
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:30:08
I think it'll fluctuate. On the one hand, we're getting SegWit. On the other hand, buy the rumour/sell the news (meaning it might already be priced in to an extent). On the third hand that no one wants to acknowledge, we'll likely get SegWit by a very large part of the community - virtually all hash rate plus a lot of big businesses (and the users they represent) - running software that locks in a hard fork three months later. To summarize: price will creep ever higher until closer to 1 Aug, with only small dips, then a big dip on SegWit activation, then a spike, then slow deflation as the realisation of no real short term capacity benefit from SegWit kicks in, then spike with hard fork talk, then dip with anti-hard fork rhetoric, then spike, then dip, etc. With any luck there won't be two coins until November, when SegWit2x forks (or with even more luck, there won't be two coins ever). All my own uneducated guesswork, not to be taken seriously and certainly not investment advice. :)

Fair point, Gavin A isn't in a position to forward the proof he received, so it's hearsay, nothing more. 
Thought experiment: CW released valid proof (publically) but Gavin A was not convinced. Then I'd expect a "CW is not Satoshi" statement from Gavin. I wonder how many would have accepted Gavin's opinion as the deciding factor for or against had CW released valid proof. It's all moot, of course.
@_date: 2016-07-25 10:46:47
I think if you put yourself in Gavin A's shoes for a second -- where "Satoshi" had to convince him personally, by reference to their years of previous work together, including private correspondence, and where a Bitcoin TX or signed message was only ever going to be icing on the cake -- and you consider that CW met that inordinately high standard of proof, then walking back beyond "I was convinced but I suppose I may have been tricked" is simply not viable. You would be lying to yourself and everyone else.
I agree, of course -- and I'my sure Gavin A would too -- that all _other_ evidence points to CW being a fraud and a train wreck.
What's funny is the subplot of CW supposedly  wanting to trash Greg M, yet the only prominent dev damaged by CW, intentionally no less, was Gavin A. No one could have planned a better move against Gavin A.
A fascinating story, one way or another, and I'm not sure we'll ever know the full truth (not whether CW is Satoshi, seems clear he is not, but rather his relationship with David K and I still find JVP's and Ian Grigg's involvement/commentary bizarre).

The code was supposed to be done by July. Agree that leaves one month (the rest of this month) but Luke-Jr's responses to the recent request for comment by HaoBTC were not exactly encouraging... I wouldn't blame the miners for planning ahead.
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:02:53
I agree, I really do, but the scaling conversation started years ago and but for a few necessary fixes to Core (mempool deals with TXs better, sorting by fee and dumping old TXs), nothing has happened (I mean actual, released and implemented changes, not wishing to take away from SegWit dev). That hasn't been a disaster (yet) but it has caused some very real UX issues (people reading about it in the NYT is not a good thing). The funny thing is, users are invariably blamed ("use a decent wallet that guesses fees better" -- whilst true, the irony is that if every wallet had an A* fee calculation algo, fees would ramp up much more quickly, wallets would still get it wrong and a more varied bunch of users, you and me included, would likely suffer). The result of that inability to act on the issue of blocksize, rightly or wrongly, is suspicion and a lack of trust in the Core devs. Hence the requirement to nail down a date.
Now maybe SegWit plus 2M non-witness by this time next year is pushing the boundaries -- in which case, let's see some data and testing. The miners seem okay with it, and they have more to lose than most. But if it opens up some sort of attack vector, for example, we should hear about it.

Speculate away but stop glossing over the fact that a lot of _users_ like the idea of SegWit2x. _Users_ use (and will continue to use) the services offered by all those Bitcoin businesses (and the attempts of the author to rubbish those businesses are, frankly, embarrassing).
Also a reminder that if the NYA participants stick to their (very optimistic) SegWit2x timeline, not only will they activate SegWit (instantly dismissing the ASICBoost allegations), they will do so in such a way as to nullify the extreme risk of a BIP148 chain split (a split that might otherwise have dire consequences for lots of Bitcoin _users_, including all those running the Bitcoin Core client).

Assuming their timetable holds, those signalling NYA will adopt the SegWit2x software immediately following its release on 21 July. It uses BIP91 for SegWit activation and it locks in a future hard fork at the same time. BIP91 timing means we should avoid a BIP148 chain split come 1 August.
If people choose _not_ to follow the hash rate and Bitcoin businesses running SegWit2x, there will be two Bitcoins when they fork on 1 November. Those sticking with the legacy chain will likely have to hard fork anyway for a difficulty adjustment or to change the PoW algo.
A lot of people maybe assume the SegWit2x signatories will drop their hard fork requirement and abandon SegWit2x before 1 November. I'm not convinced.
@_date: 2016-07-12 12:54:35
Presumably by "blockchain" you mean some form or closed/private/permissioned blockchain/distributed ledger or similar. Putting aside the question of what problem(s) they are supposed to address and whether they actually offer any efficiencies, you have to consider that none create a product comparable to bitcoins i.e. digital bearer assets.
Imagine the US government introduces FedCoin. It is quickly adopted and used by millions. Will that make Bitcoin and bitcoins any less useful? No, because FedCoin transactions would invariably be monitored and tied to identities, balances could be seized or frozen and transactions reversed.
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:25:17
Absurd. Any form of mining centralisation is suboptimal - geographical, manufacturing, oversized pools, etc - but still far from fatal. The game theoretic proposition is unchanged; very strong financial incentives still exist to prevent miners from _actually misbehaving_, with the ultimate sanction being a change of PoW.
Presumably you sold all your bitcoins through fear of mining centralisation -- or are you being irrational and hodling?
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:34:54
I'm not arguing that. Very few people are (i.e. since the NY agreement). I'm saying I have some sympathy for the arguments in favour of a hard fork increase _first_ -- as such I can see why people are behind SegWit2x (and I can get behind SegWit2x too). I personally would accept SegWit only, given that SegWit is ready, but it's not happening.

I mean the whole BIP148/SegWit2x/Bitmain Contingency Plan thing. I suspect we're heading for a chain split, which means some of the enthusiasm around SegWit2x may wear off and people might not be so bullish short to medium term on the price. I could be wrong, and miss the dip, of course.
@_date: 2016-07-02 08:17:12
The experts disagree, I think that's the point. That is why things are as they are. Various experts think (a) the network can handle SegWit plus 2M per the HK agreement (try to recall that some of your preferred experts seemingly agree, or did in HK) and (b) safely growing blocks can and  should be used as a natural scaling tool, in addition to everything else, and not as a last resort only scaling tool.
Some experts think high volume low fees is doable and preferable. Others think low volume high fees is the way to go, and that LN will solve the scaling issue.
I don't think anyone knows for sure what the right answer is. What if LN fails to solve every problem? What if it has limited use cases, because people don't want to pre-fund all their TXs, or routing proves too difficult, or main chain fees (the cost of buying the pre-paid card, even before you get to load it) are too high, and we lose momentum, users and network effects in the meantime? Or it could all work out wonderfully.
FWIW, I remain a bullish HODLer and consistent buyer. I don't think the sky is falling or anything (yet).
@_date: 2016-07-04 11:01:23
Sure, agree, but in your opinion better for Core not to give any indication of tentative timing? Because without any hint of timing, it looks a lot like more of the same ie "no hard fork at all costs".

@_date: 2016-07-31 07:49:42
At some point, stunted growth will impact price. Price has generally followed TX volume over time. Not saying this is it - a $20-30 drop is nothing. Given the recent halving and dip in hashrate, however, sustained drops could cause some pain for miners.
@_date: 2016-07-12 15:51:38
In the event of an actual war, we'd all have much bigger problems and concerns.
In the event of a cooling of relations, however... I could imagine The Great Firewall of China closing for hours or days at a time, which would cause havoc (since Chinese miners would continue to grow the longest valid chain within China and The Rest of the World would suffer re-orgs each time China rejoins).
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:07:27
I agree, far from perfect that those businesses represent the majority of the economic activity on the network, but it's a cold, hard fact nonetheless (unless their users suddenly leave in droves, which isn't happening). If _those businesses_ and _the hash rate_ decide to move, you (as a user) have a choice: follow or not.
Super low node cost with super high main chain fees is just a slightly different path towards _Bitcoin for the 1%_ BTW. IMO higher (but not datacenter high!) node cost and lower fees makes much more sense. SegWit2x is a million miles away from datacenter high nodes costs, so if faced with the "follow or not" decision in November, I'll follow. This is not where we draw the line.

Need not be that way. We are very secure already. Sure, the price of BTC could shoot up, but if fees were to drop at an equivalent rate, electricity consumption would be about the same. Of course, you'd need bigger blocks to accommodate more low fee transactions. Future halvings will play their part too.

Technically, my bitseed crapped out a week or so ago, so you're right (technically). The only time I ever had an issue though is when I opted to run Classic and my node was DDoS'd.
I have a NUC that will take over node duties, hopefully this weekend. I'm currently setting it up (learning linux as I go along). The initial download will be a minor inconvenience but I'm not sure why you think running a full node is so arduous.
@_date: 2016-07-04 13:21:11
The miners signed a commitment letter saying they would not run Classic, one of the conditions being the provision by certain Core devs (who also signed the letter) of HF code with the aim of implementing by July next year. That stopped Classic in its tracks. Where have you been?
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:33:42

If there were ever genuine demand for 10GB(!) blocks, it would surely be many, many years into the future and Bitcoin would be mainstream. 10GB blocks might even seem quaint by then, with home connections being vastly more capable. I have to believe there would be millions of businesses, charities, non-profits, governments and government agencies, banks and hobbyists in every country on the planet running full nodes at that point. Plenty of eyes watching out for double spends and the like.
I suppose more to the point: I want to run a full node at home. I get on average 185M down and 12M up, so it's easy for me. There are, however, people who are unable to run a full node _even at 1M_. Is Bitcoin broken because those people can't run a full node? No, of course not. So the question becomes: where do you draw the line? How much should it cost for someone to validate all the TXs relevant to them? How much for all the TXs period? At what point do you sacrifice or stress Bitcoin's network effects to ensure the costs remain low? Difficult questions. FWIW, if miners and businesses were proposing block sizes that might challenge my home connection, I too would take pause.
@_date: 2016-07-21 09:08:43
I don't see how. Do you have something in mind or just guessing?
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:31:33
Must admit I'm not up-to-the-minute on SegWit2x. It still seemingly has the full benefit and support of a majority of economically important nodes and hash rate though (which will be running the software well before 1 Aug). It'll be interesting for sure.

@_date: 2017-05-17 19:51:37
The question was "have miners expressed any interest". Given that in the HK agreement the miners were asking for SegWit + 2M HF, and that miners have since made statements - some recently - to the same effect, my response was yes. If that's your definition of derping, great!

Is this right? Why would a miner wait to figure out what others are mining on? Don't they mine atop their block until they see evidence of a longer valid chain (ie a new block atop another branch)?

@_date: 2017-06-21 20:14:21
I was exaggerating slightly -- by "not 100% reliable" I was referring to the possibility of e.g. your channels being closed prematurely, over which you have no control; by "expensive" I was alluding to the possibility of _very_ expensive main chain transactions (which costs have to be considered and paid in advance by the user, plus the possibility of LN routing charges, plus the possibility of channel monitoring fees, etc). Plenty of people have mused that folks will be willing to spend $50 or $100 or more _per TX_ just to move their "digital gold".
My point really was not to write-off LN before it arrives; it's very promising tech. Rather to highlight the absurdity of strangling the main chain and Bitcoin's network effects  _before_ LN arrives.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:30:15

@_date: 2016-07-23 07:14:56
That's BS and it's not how Bitcoin works. Users, miners and Bitcoin businesses all have a say in how Bitcoin progresses. Sure, a heavy weighting is given to the opinion of technical experts (beyond just devs -- academics too), but if the current set of devs don't listen to the community or the devs themselves disagree, and the community feels sufficiently strongly, the community will move on, with new devs as necessary. (Clearly not happening any time soon, but never say never.)

@_date: 2017-06-30 21:23:58


Total number of businesses, maybe, but number of users and daily volume? Way, way higher. 


Not even Core is recommending that. In any event, BIP148 requires (ironically) hash rate. So the options are: work with miners and try to bring the community back together (SegWit2x) or fight the miners, start orphaning their blocks, hope they don't attack/troll the minority chain, maybe turn to a PoW change just to survive (worst case) and generally make permanent the divide in the community. I don't blame them for trying option 1.


Devs centralisation would be just as bad as any other type.
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:34:54
CF permanently small block sizes will increase the fee levels to unaffordable leaving a larger number of cheaper nodes to service only a few wealthy main chain users. Same result if stretched to its logical conclusion. We will need to find a balance.

@_date: 2017-06-01 14:46:57
Yes, true, not that simple. You're right. From memory, my node would connect to between 18 and 30-odd peers.
I'm not arguing for more than the 2M HF (and I'm only arguing for that because it looks like an opportunity to get everyone on side). I think my home connection can handle it and I'm not expecting full utilisation of 8M weight, with things like sig aggregation and potentially Lightning in play, for some time anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:41:19
My assumption was that all the signatories to the NY agreement would in fact run SegWit2x and insist on the hard fork. From the agreement:










More to the point, the legacy chain will need hash rate to operate (and, more likely than not, a hard fork to adjust the difficulty and/or a PoW algo change). How long might that take?
Anyway, we'll have months to mull over the details in the three months post-SegWit, a long time in Bitcoinland. :)
@_date: 2017-06-26 11:08:24
You'd be lying...
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:01:13
The other side finds it equally suspicious that so much energy is being put into SegWit only and refusing even the smallest base block size increase (with some BIP148ers now talking about changing the PoW in the event BIP148 doesn't get enough hash rate!).
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:08:49


I agree. But I said "[a base block size increase] actually provides instant capacity (SegWit does not)".
SegWit's increase is not instant, predictable or guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:26:50
How long after 1 Aug (assuming SegWit is activated then) will 2M of block space be available? (Hint: you have no idea and it may never even happen.)
The other side are okay with SegWit's capacity benefits, nominal though they are, and with that slightly dodgy discount made necessary by the soft fork implementation, but their priority is for _real_, _predictable_, and _guaranteed_ capacity to come online sooner than later, hence the hard fork requirement. Waiting for (potentially many) _years_ to realise SegWit's (and Schnoor sigs' and MAST's and LN's) benefits whilst strangling Bitcoin and damaging its network effects is just _not an attractive proposition_ to them.
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:05:21
To be fair, the SegWit2x dev effort has a very specific and reasonably clearly articulated aim which they understandably do not want to deviate from: locking in SegWit *and* a 2x hard fork. It's perfectly reasonable that comments from "outsiders" that purposefully deviate from that plan, usually to remove the hard fork lock in, are ignored/brushed aside. The equivalent would be people making PRs in relation to BIP148 to try and include a built in hard fork mechanism.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:23:55
Negativity echoed by most Core devs, FYI.
My main issue is that BIP148 had (has) very little support; the concerted efforts of eg Luke and Samson look likely to turn it BIP148 into something that is actually disruptive and may cause losses _but still fail_. Luke even says he'll work on the change of PoW if/when it fails -- they want a split IMHO and I don't want to see that chain split, hence my posts. If (big if) BIP148 gets overwhelming support, I'll do a sigh of relief along with everyone else and cheer the adoption of SegWit. Ditto with SegWit2x.
@_date: 2016-07-04 07:50:17


Don't be silly. The miners and certain Core devs signed up to an agreement with dates. Core could easily add target dates. Everyone knows how hard forks work and why a date on a roadmap would not be a guaranteed enactment date.
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:58:36
Please can you describe your daily/weekly/monthly average usage of Bitcoin, so we can better assess the relevance of your full node (vs adding to the Sybil)?
Also, how long do you intend to leave this running _on your laptop_? Will it be 24/7 and will you dedicate a wired connection to this endeavor? Why haven't you felt the need to run a full node before (or do you already have another full node up and running)?
(Only half joking.)

It's no more "china-coin" than Bitcoin will be if the 2x hard fork does not happen. It's "Bitcoin businesses and hash rate and users coin". :)
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:34:45
If all the NY agreement participants stick to their guns and run SegWit2x, the vast majority of econ activity will disappear from the legacy chain overnight, as will virtually all the hash rate (such that the legacy chain will likely require its own hard fork just to change the difficulty, if not the PoW). Attempts to resuscitate the minority chain will likely face hash rate attacks or trolling. People won't care about the legacy coins because they will be unusable -- the network (for that chain) will be broken vs a perfectly normal, working Bitcoin on the other side (supported by the same businesses the majority of _users_ know and love).
Bitcoin doesn't care and, frankly, I don't think most users care enough about the SegWit vs SegWit2x differences to actually demand a permanent split.
Just IMO.
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:10:03
Oh, has someone found a way to reverse mining centralisation? Link? AFAICT, status quo 1M, classic 2M, SegWit's upto 4M and SegWit2x's upto 8M make virtually zero difference.

The status quo does damage too (plainly evident).
@_date: 2016-07-27 09:57:33

@_date: 2017-06-19 12:18:36
Completely agree and FWIW I too will take a stand if they (relatively centralised businesses and mining pools) quickly decide to further increase block sizes or move to BU/EC. My gut feeling is SegWit2x will provide capacity and other key advances for years to come.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:47:06
Sure they have, but until recently we haven't seen miners _and_ users/economically important node owners standing together and committing to do that, even working on a fork of the repo. Previously, the closest we got was miners and a few businesses making noises in relation to Classic; that prompted certain Core devs and senior Blockstream folk to rush to Hong Kong to get the miners to agree _not to run_ Core incompatible code (ironically, in return for SegWit+2MHF!).
There has never been an agreement like the NY agreement, not even close. (I do recognise that the 2x part might come to nothing, but Bitcoin can surprise you, so you shouldn't take anything for granted.)
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:35:27
BIP148 won't be a nice, fully working alternative chain! It currently has close to zero hash rate. Blocks will take an inordinately long time to find. It will be considerably worse than the legacy chain (even assuming no attacks) but you think users (and more specifically the businesses that represent the vast majority of users) definitely will switch, despite all the evidence (hello NY agreement) to the contrary?
If yes, that's fine, I just disagree. We'll find out in August (or we'll never know because the situation will have changed).
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:40:17


That data or knowledge will only be available after all the milestones I mentioned above.
I think it's naive to think Core will support a hard fork increase within a year or two post SegWit, no matter how little capacity SegWit actually provides. I didn't even point to the inevitable "SegWit's up to 4M blocks are already too big" argument.

@_date: 2017-06-09 12:19:01


Erm, in what world? Despite the bluster, the miners know full well not to move without econ majority support. They were arguably getting close with Classic, until the infamous HK agreement. A mandate is much clearer now with SegWit2x.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:55:11
Which bit?
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:15:28
The miners have been consistent -- they want a block size increase, and have done for a long time. SegWit was a complete switcheroo that baffled miners and bigger block advocates alike. It offered very little in terms of capacity increase at the time (code was not ready, implementation would take ~~months or~~ years and any potential capacity gains were not even guaranteed - they still aren't). Hence renewed optimism for Classic and it's 2M HF... Right up until the HK agreement, which stopped Classic dead. That's my recollection, anyway.
EDIT: To be clear, agree that the miners could activate SegWit but _SegWit-only_ would be inconsistent with the miners' stance throughout these years of debate. SegWit2x makes much more sense.
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:32:33
Pretty sure you can use Bitcoin Core to extract the private keys, then import the private keys into another wallet - so install Core, run it, close it when it starts to download the blockchain, replace wallet.dat with your wallet.dat, restart it and then use the debug window/console to extract your private key(s).
Edit: described here, I think this still works: 
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, or if there's an easier way.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:15:51
I came around to SegWit first some time ago but I have some sympathy for those holding out for a hard fork increase. Keep in mind they were arguing for a simple and effective block size increase before SegWit was even an option. They look at SegWit and wonder why _it_ can't wait until after a can-kick increase that actually provides instant capacity (SegWit does not). They look at the discount and think it's awfully convenient that Confidential Transactions stand to gain the most. They don't trust the Core devs (and Adam Back) who signed the HK agreement after their woeful/non- efforts to promote the SegWit plus 2M hard fork. They think Core's approach is too conservative at best, and network effect destroying at worst.
Both sides have their heels dug in. SegWit2x is interesting because big Bitcoin businesses have seemingly had enough and have determined to back the miners and force the issue. They've made it BIP148 compatible to minimise BIP148 chain split risk (following the advice of and merging the input of James Hilliard, a Core dev). It stops covert ASICBoost. Crucially, it guarantees additional capacity, which SegWit alone does not.
There was always a danger part of the community would opt to run different software. Such is the nature of Bitcoin. I guess we wait and see what happens.
I'm hodling on all the chains regardless.
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:29:03
Yes, in the sense that we can dispense with the hard fork FUD and not be scared of growing the main chain (but only within reason). No, in the sense that each such increase requires community buy in and whereas 2/8 is fine for me right now, I (currently) won't accept anything larger and don't expect to for some time. My home connection will improve in years to come, but I still subscribe to the idea of home (full) nodes, not datacenter only nodes.
Given the shitstorm over a 2M increase, I doubt very much this will lead to the realisation of a slippery slope scenario. That's something for each one of us as users to weigh up, I suppose.
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:25:16


Dude, it's not even about coffee. Bitcoin will be unusable (or too expensive) for virtually all commerce, be it DNMs or the online commerce referenced in the white paper. People will use other cryptos _by necessity_.
Where do you draw the line?
Because some will still consider Bitcoin to be a "success" if fees push so many people away, hobbling Bitcoin's all important network effects, so that all that remain are big banks, corps and governments. They will be the economic majority with de facto control of the Bitcoin blockchain. Individuals won't be able to afford the type of financial sovereignty Satoshi imagined. At best they'll pay fiat to access (or earn access to) LN credit channels provided _to them_ by banks, corps and governments. Forget privacy or unstoppable TXs. Wikileaks will have to look elsewhere. Have fun with that!

@_date: 2017-06-17 19:07:58
Not sure what your point is. The vast majority of economic activity on the network today has already signed up to SegWit2x. Given the recent FUD and Bitmain's UASF defensive plan, it was important for the miners to restate their commitment. Bitcoin is moving forward, one way or another.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:33:48


No one is talking about on-chain scaling only. Everyone agrees we need both. I recognise that some people think GB blocks will one day be fine, but I don't think anyone is dead against e.g. Lightning.
What some people are against is SegWit's nominal, potentially slowly delivered and not guaranteed capacity benefit vs an instant, guaranteed bump (a HF with or without SegWit).
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:44:38
"Core" is much more fluid than some sort of entity. Core devs can (and do!) contribute to multiple repos. Imagining a scenario where enough of the community moves to adopt SegWit2x, such that it is "Bitcoin", and the Core maintainers inexplicably refuse or are incapable of merging appropriate changes into the Core client, I imagine a lot of the contributors known as "Core" devs will simply switch repos or fork the Core repo to remove the roadblock.
I find it odd that people consistently argue that "there is no Core" and "no one represents Core", etc, and then in the same breath they talk about coups, takeovers and abandonment/shutting out of Core devs, as if that were possible.
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:32:25

@_date: 2017-06-20 11:57:22
No one is telling you what software to run! Nor can they. That's the beauty of Bitcoin - you can run whatever software they want.
Heck it's even better than that: as a hodler pre-hard fork, you have coins reserved just for you on the new chain! So if and when you determine that the legacy chain - without Bitcoin businesses, hash rate and users - is actually _really shitty_, you'll have perfectly good "bitcoins" waiting for you on the new chain. (Unless you sell them, of course.) :)
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:10:04
Lightning is not ready. Virtually the entirety of the hash rate and economic activity will have moved on via the 2x hard fork by the time it is -- and the 2x chain will use it.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:19:10
UASF absolutely requires hash rate. Or fork off and change PoW.
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:39:36
I think you're mistaken. I think a very large swathe of the community is ready to accept larger blocks on top of SegWit (a great many of whom may remain dead against the idea of ever increasing block sizes that make home nodes impossible!). 2x is acceptable to them (whereas 20M or BU are not).
But I might well be wrong and Bitcoin will stick with 1M. Only time will tell.
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:02:52
Sure, the miners want a hard fork increase and they're willing to bundle in SegWit to get it. That has always been the position of the majority of miners.
SegWit2x is absolutely "for the users" -- the majority of whom are and will be represented by the Bitcoin businesses running economically important nodes that signed up to the NY agreement. Unless those signatories don't back down (guess we'll have to wait and see), a lot of "users" will be represented by their SegWit2x nodes.
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:33:18

There are probably a couple of good points in there, and LN is certainly not problem free (or even ready for prime-time, yet), but you're right, it reads like a hit piece, of which there have been a few (the SegWit's-signature-segregation-might-cause-issues-under-US-law article that Coindesk published springs to mind -- a nonsense FUD piece produced by nChain).
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:34:30
The sky has not fallen, true (Core was updated to handle full blocks and climbing fees much better, and a bunch of wallets better estimate fees too - yay) but... Bitcoin had been growing (TX volume) at a consistent rate and now it can't continue to grow at that rate. Are you sure that's a good thing?
LN is years away, let's at least be honest about that.

Reminder: ridicule all you want but bigger blocks will be required above and beyond SegWit. There's zero technical limitation that says we have to do block size increases later vs now (though I agree we should get SegWit done now, given that it's deployed and good to go).
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:11:48
Agree! I have come to believe this too, and I will stand right along side you if and when proposals are made for block size or weight increases that I consider too big for my home connection. 2M is just not it though, even with the SegWit multiplier.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:06:01
Just to be clear, you think if all the signatories to the NY agreement and any other support they muster move on with the SegWit2x hard fork in November or whenever, Core devs will continue working on Core, which will remain a legacy chain client? You think they'll ignore SegWit2x (except to the extent they have to hard fork for a difficulty adjustment or change of PoW to address the massive loss of hash rate on the legacy chain)?
Or was it the "Or we'll get to November and the idea of a hard fork will fall away, who knows?" bit that confused you?

Clearly that is not the idea. The idea is to pressure Core into including a change in Core that miners believe users want. A change that certain Core devs and Adam Back already agreed to (publically) develop and provide to miners this month.

How's that massive SegWit upgrade working out for you? It'll be August on Monday. Bitcoin growth has basically stopped dead.
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:45:06


Given that all indications so far show that the majority of everything - nodes, economic activity and hash rate - will not be running BIP148 on 1 Aug, two chains is almost guaranteed (so long as BIP148 miners and nodes _opt_ to eject themselves from the Bitcoin network). Following your logic to its natural conclusion, anyone can dream up a soft fork, enforce it in the same way BIP148 enforces SegWit, get a nominal amount of hash rate on-side and then blame the remaining 99% of the hash rate for "maliciously attacking the network". It's utter nonsense. You can assume there'll be a massive swing in favour of BIP148 before 1 Aug, but it's a wild assumption to make at this point in time, and you should be clear about that.

I think the problem is that it has taken so long to get here*, bigger block supporters (including prominent devs like Jeff G and Gavin A, who committed years of their lives to make Bitcoin work) are worried that without target dates it could be years more before Core implements a hard fork increase, which could do untold damage in terms of UX and adoption.
*Here meaning the prospect of a very modest increase via a SegWit soft fork which, if we're lucky, will activate later this year. 2M via SegWit will require universal adoption (which may never happen) and eg the new SegWit address format, which isn't even included in the proposed SegWit release. 1.3 to 1.5 short term is much more likely. (Johoe did a detailed look at the numbers, I'll find a link.)
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:00:43
You know what he means. The hard fork FUD has been relentless since SegWit-as-a-soft-fork was revealed. Bitcoin almost certainly needs future hard forks, if only to realise its full potential (and the full potential of things like signature aggregation!).

You really don't think it would have been better to let BIP148 fail for lack of support? You throwing your weight behind it has undoubtably caused others to do the same and the risk now is BIP148 goes from something destined to die within hours to something that may cause real damage, disruption and cause real losses. If it remains obvious that BIP148 will not have the necessary support by 1 Aug, will you recklessly push ahead or will you advise everyone to switch back to legacy (or those signalling to not actually go ahead with BIP148)?
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:20:21
Ah, good. Just wanted to be sure.
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:02:26
Incorrect. It's not their _preference_, but there are, in fact, active Core devs _actively working on_ SegWit2x code.
If SegWit2x actually happens - ie businesses and all the miners run it en masse - I have little doubt Core devs will ultimately be pragmatic and work on the SegWit2x branch or indeed merge the change into Core. Or we'll get to November and the idea of a hard fork will fall away, who knows?

I'm still excited for LN. I just think it's unfortunate that some people are already betting the farm on it.
There has been talk of potentially very high main chain fees. Adam Back mentioned $100 (saying he thinks people would pay it, but much lower would be better). If you follow the main chain digital gold/limited block size argument to its logical conclusion, you could end up with v high TX fees. Which means a v expensive fee _just to get access to LN_, before you even consider how much you want to lock up, channel monitoring fees, LN node relay fees, etc.
I'm cautiously optimistic and the people working on Lightning are (as far as I can tell) brilliant, so something good will come of it.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:16:40


Those companies represent REAL USERS. The ones that actually buy and _use_ bitcoins. Coinbase alone serves millions of them FFS. Users who spend bitcoins on DNMs, etc. Way more volume than localbitcoins even (not sure what their stance is on this). So how many users do you think they are losing or will lose because of their participation in the NY agreement? (Hint: close to zero. That's the unfortunate truth.)


Fine, call it an alt if you must. The businesses, exchanges and hash rate that service this new "alt" will call it "Bitcoin" and thus it will be, even if "one user is against it". Brutal truth: that user will have to make a decision. Use _the thing that everyone else calls Bitcoin_ or go on his merry way.
@_date: 2016-07-21 09:11:11
Another big difference: imagine if all the MtGox coins had moved to one single address and it was spotted quickly. The community might have acted very differently (we'll never know, of course). I still think the Eth HF was absolutely the wrong thing to do.

Hate to state the obvious but this sub is heavily erm, moderated, so most bigger block supporters are banned or shadow banned and new bigger block posts are quickly deleted. People who might otherwise argue for bigger blocks choose not to for fear of being banned or shadow banned.
You could always pop across to you-know-where if you miss the action.
Another reason could be that new money coming into crypto now goes to alt coins, not Bitcoin. Speculation and network effects growing elsewhere. The Eth train wreck also very distracting (not recommending, I only hold Bitcoin.)

@_date: 2017-06-02 16:09:45
That's not happening because that's not how BU works. (I absolutely do not support BU but I recognise that much at least.) Why? Because miners won't budge without the support of economically important nodes. Heck there's a TX with hundreds of bitcoins in fees waiting for the first miner to mine that &gt;1M block, and it still hasn't happened. Miners now have that support but it's in the form of the NY agreement, so SegWit2x, not BU.
On the other side you have BIP148 with seemingly very little economic support and even less hash rate support. IMHO the only thing the BIP148 folk will achieve with their social media blitz is to guarantee (2) below (but still be a million miles away from (3)).
BIP148 likely outcomes (simplified):
(1) no miners = fail.
(2) few miners = fail (chain split).
(3) most miners = success, SegWit for everyone.

Odd though that hard forks weren't deemed impossibly unsafe before SegWit-by-soft-fork was invented. That narrative seemed to spring up in support of SegWit.

No, I query whether a 2M hard fork on top of SegWit is really where you draw the line (it being a long way from "chinacoin datacenter coin", as you put it. SegWit2x is not where I draw the line.

Save that if they don't verify, they risk their block being invalid (unless empty). So miners usually verify.
For the benefit of the OP: the new coins (and any fees on transactions included in the block) are the miner's reward for successfully adding a new block to the blockchain (which everyone else accepts). Miners are not searching for/discovering new bitcoins.

That is the fear - once SegWit is activated it will be years and years of "but we have to wait for SegWit and LN to realise their full potential". That's why people want to see a commitment to a hard fork increase.

Tantamount to academic fraud. I just don't think he understands that.
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:30:26
Hmm, I disagree. I have some sympathy for those arguing that a simple can-kick, guaranteed to be instantly available capacity increase is best for Bitcoin's short term health (albeit as a hindsight thing i.e. we should have can-kicked long before now). Prior to the invention of SegWit-as-a-soft-fork, most people were generally onboard with the idea of increasing the block size (in some way, shape or form) via a hard fork. Miners have consistently called for a hard fork, in fact.
At the same time, LN, as promising as it is, _is not ready_. And SegWit's capacity bump - the thing Bitcoin arguably needs most - is unpredictable, could be rolled out very slowly indeed and is not actually guaranteed (the schedule or the total gain).
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:09:24
On the first bit you quoted, I think the author was trying to point out that it's pointless to set up a Lightning channel unless you are absolutely committed to sending multiple TXs (as opposed to one TX), since the open/close costs are too expensive. Imagine you decide that you _might_ buy lots of coffees from your very progressive local coffee shop that has started accepted Bitcoin. You really need to commit to _buying lots of coffees_ from that shop, especially in the early days of LN where that coffee shop might not be terribly well connected (in terms of the payment routes it could offer you and your committed funds). Given the price of opening/closing channels, and having to set aside funds upfront, it might not make sense. Similarly, if the circumstances were such that the coffee shop only ever received one or two coffee payments from you, chances are main chain fees would mean closing that channel to claim the funds wouldn't make financial sense.
On the second point, he means the user's perspective. Unless you connect to a massive JPMorgan hub, and provide ID and whatever else the hub requires, you might need multiple channels open in order to make all the payments you want to make (because, for example, the channel you originally opened with your coffee shop, which isn't particularly well connected, can't find a payment route to your favourite t-shirt shop -- so then you end up with two channels open, with funds committed to both).
At least they were my takes when I read it.

FWIW, he seems like an honest/sincere type, heart on his sleeve and all that, and seemingly dedicated to Bitcoin. I was surprised to hear about the Ethereum connection.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:59:54


At least be honest about what you mean.
You mean SegWit should be activated now _and_ there should be no base block size increase unless and until:
- SegWit itself realises its full capacity increasing potential (being 2.1M or whatever, which requires virtually all TXs on the network to be SegWit TXs, complete with new SegWit address type in play)
- Schnoor sigs, MAST and other SegWit dependent upgrades should be implemented and each one allowed to realise its own potential for eking out capacity gains
- Lightning should be up and running and given ample opportunity to realise its full potential for moving TXs off chain
Years and years of excuses for avoiding any future hard fork increase.
I honestly think that's why a big portion of the community are making a stand and insisting on a hard fork increase triggered by SegWit activation (after all, if "so many people have already said that it's very likely that a base block size increase will be needed in the near future", and given the relatively conservative size of the increase being proposed, why not commit now?).
@_date: 2016-07-15 09:05:21

To the extent they don't represent economic activity on the network, they are irrelevant.

Core will not be "wiped out", that's absurd. If and when the community collectively moves, and it becomes clear (for example) that SegWit2x will be "Bitcoin", that's when Core upgrades. Devs will keep working on the Core reference client and (IMO) it won't be any less important. In fact, I imagine a lot of Core devs will be pleased (yes, pleased!) to know that they (collectively) do not have a monopoly or veto rights or total responsibility when it comes to Bitcoin dev -- a move by the community to support SegWit2x would be a positive (yes, positive!) affirmation of decentralised dev (so if the Core reference client devs ever find themselves stuck, unable to merge a particular change for political reasons, the community can and will make the decision for them, allowing everyone to get on with dev'ing Bitcoin).
Sure some people will want a Jeff G controlled alternative repo to take over as the reference client, but I don't think that's likely (or if it is, it just means most Core devs move across and Bitcoin as FOSS continues along the other branch). Worst case scenario is a tiny number of the most prominent Core devs feel a little butthurt and rage-quit (which I see as very unlikely).
Whatever the case, Bitcoin proceeds with SegWit and increased 2x capacity (obviously I'm still assuming SegWit2x prevails).
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:10:44
Funny thing is, I will stand right along side you if and when proposals are made for block size or weight increases that I consider too big. 2M is just not it though, even with the SegWit multiplier, sorry.
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:37:56
Fair, but I also wonder whether Lightning will be sufficiently compelling to protect _those particular network effects_ (merchants accepting, users spending).
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:38:48


Here's the thing: it's already impossible for some users to validate all TXs themselves (same would apply to 512Kb blocks). So where do you draw the line? Answer: the line is **not** 1Mb! (It can't be that anyway because SegWit allows blocks up to 4M total size (even if only some of that is realisable capacity)).
So is 4M the line? 4M now and up to 8M in a year or two (SegWit+2MHF aka the NY agreement, recognising that blocks won't immediately by full)?
At some point, I too will resist further growth, because I want to validate all TXs using my home connection. Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones, but 8M every 10 minutes is fine for me. Heck, I bought Battlefield 1 a few weeks back -- well over 40GB and I was playing it an hour or so later (8M is only ~420GB per _year_ FYI).
OP insists we should all get our act together but then immediately labels all the users, businesses and hash rate behind the NY agreement "attackers" -- completely unhelpful.
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:38:04
Don't add to the _hard-fork-increase-equals-centralisation_ FUD. There's no technical limitation that says we have to hard fork increase later vs hard fork increase now (though I accept, of course, that SegWit is now deployed and ready to go, so let's do that!).
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:21:25
EDIT: FWIW, I do get it. I wouldn't want to be the one clinging onto xMB blocks in the face of overwhelming support for _bigger blocks than I can handle_. But I figure with SegWit long since activated, that's far less likely to ever happen.
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:42:40


Erm, because the Bitcoin mailing list members had already vetoed/trashed/mocked Sergio L's SegWit+2MHF proposal.
Ultimately, a bunch of people spoke to each other to determine whether they could all _in fact_ support a SegWit+2MHF plan _notwithstanding_ a lack of support from Core.
That is hardly the same thing as sneaking around in private.
EDIT: Also, the SegWit in SegWit2x is no different to the current SegWit deployment, meaning it prevents covert ASICBoost.
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:31:26

Even if they do trade both (rather than just put coin split mechanisms in place), the next bit of his tweet is reckless speculation/investment advice too:


There will be very little hash rate and very little economic activity (based on current signalling of support, which basically amounts to a social media barrage). The default position is: legacy chain has virtually all the hash rate. Economically important nodes are not going to jump across to the BIP148 chain that has virtually no hash rate.

If nothing else, UASF will get SegWit activated via SegWit2x, whose timetable has clearly been designed around avoiding a BIP148 chain split. In that sense, it will be successful. If the SegWit2x timetable slips, who knows? 
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:00:07
First it was "go get hash rate". Then it was "you need economically important nodes". Now it's "yeah but my node that I barely use!". Pfft.
Bitcoin does not care. If it moves on, it moves on. I think there's sufficient momentum behind SegWit2x that it _can_ happen. You think it absolutely cannot, and that's fine.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:37:43


I don't think anyone is making that argument.


2.3M would be fantastic short(ish) term, but _if_ SegWit delivers 2.3M, it will invariably do so in an entirely _unpredictable_ way, potentially very slowly indeed and with no guarantee on total capacity (2.3M requires 100% adoption -- how long do you think that will take? Hint: it may never happen, at least not until a hard fork). Hence some would much rather see a _bona fide_, instant, predictable capacity increase immediately, notwithstanding SegWit's other benefits. I think SegWit now, but I have sympathy for the not insignificant portion of the community resisting that change.


Agreed. Thankfully(?), it looks like one or both of BIP148 and SegWit2x will force the issue.


I like your optimism, but given the years long stance of SegWit-only-for-now proponents, and all the associated hard fork FUD, I doubt it. It'll be a case of "we have to wait until SegWit has realised its full potential" and "Schnoor sigs are on the way" and "MAST will help", yada yada. In other words, the years of inexplicable delay repeated.

No, because there's still BIP8/149 (you know, the _other_ UASF approach that Core is likely to adopt if/when BIP141 expires)!
You have a chicken and egg problem, unfortunately. BIP148 does not have the support it needs, hence you have people like Peter Wuille and Greg Maxwell and Matt Corallo and Jonas Schnelli etc all arguing _against_ pumping BIP148!


If this were BIP8/149, I'd agree. It's not. BIP148 is giving UASF a bad name.
If there's a BIP148 chain split, it will be because the minority of BIP148 users decided to eject themselves from the Bitcoin network. For everyone else, it will be business as usual.

I suppose that depends on how you define necessary.

Sure, but all other things being equal (i.e. if BIP148 happened today), 99.9% of users will be happily transacting on the legacy chain as usual. The default position is this: virtually all economic activity, value and hash rate *is already on* the legacy chain. They all have to switch to BIP148 to make BIP148 a success. There's no real sign of that happening (yet) -- in fact, there are very real signs it won't (the NY agreement). At best, it's a horrible chicken and egg scenario.


So presumably you're expecting those economically important nodes - Coinbase, for example - to start shedding hundreds of thousands of users _because of BIP148_? That seems wildly optimistic. There's no sign of that happening _at all_.


Agree, but why do you think the BIP148 chain will be "profitable" and/or the legacy chain will be "unvalued"? The BIP148 chain (unless there's a major shift in favour before 1 Aug) will start with few users, even less hash rate (and therefore very, very slow blocks, greatly impacting its utility and ability to retain or attract _economic activity_) _and_ it will have to compete with a perfect working, business as usual, legacy chain.
And we haven't even touched on things like legacy chain miners dedicating small portions of their hash rate to troll the BIP148 chain (with empty blocks, for example).
By far the most likely outcome if miners don't switch, the economy doesn't switch, BIP148 dies or perma splits (with BIP148 supporters doubling down to change the PoW and ending up with an alt). IMO, recognising that things can change quickly.

Most users, like it or not, are represented by those businesses. I'm not saying that's ideal, but we're talking about _millions of users_ vs _thousands_ (or more likely, in the case of BIP148, it's tens or maybe hundreds at a push). I don't know what the answer is, but come November, if it looks like they - the SegWit2x businesses and hash rate - will pushing ahead, I'll follow.
FYI, those 95,000 nodes would find themselves on the _wrong_ side of a BIP148 chain split, along with my current Core node.

Might explain why he heavily favours the idea of Bitcoin as digital gold vs digital cash.

SegWit in SegWit2x is bona fide SegWit -- they are the same, for all intents and purposes.
The 2x part adds greater (excess, if you like) capacity. It's fine not to buy into _much_ larger blocks or emergent consensus - I don't - but declaring SegWit2x to be "scam bullshit" seems OTT.

For someone who thinks bigger than 1M blocks are genuinely bad for Bitcoin, you sure do seem intent on creating something with SegWit-up-to-4M-blocks even in the face of complete community rejection (let's face it, UASF without 15-25% hash rate means it probably had too few _users_ to begin with).
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:48:39
I think you have to send (or receive) coins to a SegWit address first, only then can you receive the benefit.

Nothing at all, but like it or not BarryCoin seems to have the support of the wider community -- users, economic activity and hash rate (and even some Core devs who recognise that his may be the only way forward). We've arguably never had this level of support pushing one "compromise" agreement. If they truly have "had enough" and are willing to push ahead regardless of any chain split and the viability of any minority chain, maybe there will be two Bitcoins, Bitcoin-with-SegWit-and-larger-blocks and 1M-super-expensive-channel-opening-Bitcoin-with-SegWit-only-coin.

For pity's sake, you know what he means.
And how come you're fine describing SegWit as a 2M upgrade? Shouldn't you be highlighting it's max 4M block size?

The way on chain is heading, people won't use it to buy anything under the price of a car or house. Bitcoin was very clearly meant for much smaller purchases IMO, and basis given was low cost. I struggle to believe Satoshi envisioned purposefully constrained TX volume x high TX fee rather than large TX volume x low TX fee.

Some great articles from BM recently. Struggling to clear my reading list.

Both. It's not completely opt-in (since it impacts those who don't "opt-in"), and it's not completely without its downsides (though they are arguably outweighed by the positives).

Sadly, I think the rushed nature of BIP148 and it's inevitable messy collapse will make future UASFs, including BIP149, that much harder to sell.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:33:38
Now you're speaking like one of those -- someone who probably wants to see BIP148 fail (a chain split and an opportunity to change of PoW). If you think the miners are hostile, you should really have sold by now.

I'm not sure I understand his point. Cobra-Bitcoin can suggest whatever he wants, but if it's something stupid and offensive - like creating a revised bitcoin.pdf and replacing the link to the original white paper - he should expect to be shot down. (He later said that the original whitepaper would still be referenced, which is better, but he's still proposing attributing words to Satoshi that were not his. His name should be on it, not Satoshi's.)

Hmm, hard forks were not deemed to be so impossibly difficult or dangerous that everyone was furiously looking for soft fork alternatives, was my point. I don't recall any alternative option chat prior to the SegWit reveal.
Hence we saw multiple hard fork BIPs put forward and promoted by current Core devs, no less. And people like Adam Back pushing 2-4-8. Or were they trolling?
I'm not saying people didn't recognise the dangers and difficulties associated with hard forks, but the whole impossibly dangerous narrative is a post SegWit thing. The main complaints at the time (my recollection, at least) were the initial size increase and the slippery slope argument (a developing divide between people who believed blocks would ultimately be GBs big and others who believed blocks should remain small (but not 1M small!)).

It was signalling to the wider community that if enough people ran BU or any other &gt;1M block software, the miners would be ready to act.

There is a very significant level of user support/economic activity behind SegWit2x. What is missing exactly?

Thanks for taking the time to explain this to me. So what I think you are saying is that Bitmain wants to destroy Bitcoin, or doesn't care if Bitcoin is destroyed by its actions/inactions, because, notwithstanding that it has multi-million dollar investments in ASIC mining and a money printing monopoly in ASIC manufacturing, all of which would be lost/rendered worthless, it also has some GPUs mining Litecoin, so it is perfectly hedged? Did I get that right?
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:57:13
Herein lies the problem:


There is no timeline for if/when SegWit is/is not a success in terms of its capacity benefit. So what SegWit-only-for-now folk really want is zero base block size/weight increase unless and until:
- SegWit itself realises its full potential (being 2.1M or whatever, which requires virtually all TXs on the network to be SegWit TXs, complete with a new SegWit address type in play) -- this might never actually happen.
- Schnoor sigs, MAST and other SegWit dependent upgrades are implemented and each one is allowed to realise its full potential for eking out capacity gains.
- Lightning is up and running _and_ given ample opportunity to realise its full potential for moving TXs off chain.
In short, many more years of excuses for avoiding a future hard fork increase, risking significant further damage to Bitcoin's network effects. This is what bigger block supporters fear/are deeply suspicious of.

Not prevent SegWit per se (unless you buy the ASICBoost conspiracy theory), rather prevent _SegWit-only-for-now_, which is the stated position of Core and 1M block proponents.


The miners have been remarkably consistent since long before SegWit: they want a hard fork base block size increase. They seemingly don't care for SegWit - and certainly don't see it as a bona fide capacity increase - but they'll activate it _alongside a HF increase_.
