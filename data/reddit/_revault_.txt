Shares were never part of the plan. The whole idea is to groupbuy devices so we can get the cost down to an acceptable level and hopefully encourage more people to get access to a secure wallet.

Hey! We're working on something exactly like that. [Here](
Your keys would be stored on your android device and you would be able to sign transactions generated on a external device.

You could have an external device generate the transaction and sign it on the air gapped phone.

Its not a regular wallet app. Our app allows you sign transactions offline on the android device so that you can create and send transactions on even a compromised computer. The private keys never leave the device.

Our solution addresses many problems that I think bither does not properly address.
* Allows you to create your own entropy when generating new wallets
* Also completely open source
* No internet permission
* Webapp works on all devices
* Sourcing of cheap dedicated hardware

Depends on how cheaply we can source cheap android devices. We expect it to cost around $50-60.

Again we are just trying to keep costs down for people who want to order a cheap device. There is nothing to invest in and never will be.

We will have warning measures in place.

The crowdfunding would go towards a group buy of cheap android devices so your wallet could be physically separated from your main phone which could be compromised. This effectively creates a hardware wallet for storing coin using cheap consumer hardware.

We display the signed transaction on the offline device in the form of a QR code. The user can then scan it on an online computer and broadcast it to the network.
