@_date: 2018-03-05 04:03:25
Its a good day to break $12000 
@_date: 2018-03-19 05:10:09
Looks like I was wrong should have called $9000 today shot pass $8000 without a blink go Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:26:50
Sunday sell off say we will break $8000 on Monday
@_date: 2018-03-10 05:37:48
Hold on boys the charts show we could break $ 10 000 soon
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:25:12
Nope not yet but be patient it will happen.
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:07:34
So change the ratio buy more and hodl and get more people to buy 1 BTC then the masses control it and not a few fat whales
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:22:07
Really watch this video 
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:01:55
Keep going mate you are doing just fine just made another mistake looks like its going to test 7500 lol
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:54:11
Sell it will fall shortly 
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:15:08
Looking good for $9500 perhaps the whales will let us break $10 000 tomorrow
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:42:15
Let me try to much fud on a daily basis and fear of new rules that will control or destroy Bitcoin, if you want to be reassured that you would be okay with your Bitcoin investment go listen to Andreas Antonopoulos He will also tell you that they will try and destroy Bitcoin every day as they fear it so park your Bitcoin and believe in it and buy more or sell it and stay out of the market the choice is yours.
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:19:53
Nope wrong again they are in trouble there are 1 billion people that do not have bank accounts so they don't know what the fuss is about, but they sure as hell are interested in getting involved with bitcoin or payment systems via there phones they do have phones there is internet available get the point we need time it will happen and they don't live in the USA either. So where does this story lead to, we are going to run out of cheap Bitcoins to buy in the near future and you are going to be mad that you did not buy and store because the price could go ...... wanna guess??????? 
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:28:43
Upward movement now buy hold and park in wallet and dont sell to the whales  if not sure what to do repeat the step above
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:12:23
Dollar average since $2700
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:58:43
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:06:37
So lets use our power and vote with our feet if we all close down our facebook profiles they are screwed people are getting borred with facebook and the personal crap that gets posted on a daily basis, getting close to kick it into touch so lets get them back if they want to play dirty. Sorry but I am in a mood to defend Bitcoin we are all tired of this negative fud so lets invest long term or sell off and find other investments.
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:14:35
Lol 
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:17:18
Ask your self how many people own a Bitcoin surely more than 166 000 so lets all buy one and remove the supply from the market we will gain and the price will gain easy as that 
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:40:11
Fud is over settled at $9700 should bounce back over $ 10 000 by tomorrow hold on 
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:46:12
Hodl and lets close our trading and come back after the easter weekend perhaps the whales will get bored and loose interest.
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:04:46
Looking good to break $11000 today lets go USA its your turn now
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:05:24
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:53:36
So the lesson that I learned from that is to stay away from the shit coins and buy only BTC and perhaps 2 to 3 altcoins with future values can't wait for 90 percent of these shit coins to dissapear
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:13:01
Just like they said the internet is not going to happen, your choice what to believe why don't you buy just one BTC close your trading and post something here again in 2025 and then you can thank us not now.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:11:50
Remember there is less than 21 million Bitcoin and a billion potential investors think facebook so if we all buy fractions and lets asume most cant afford to buy a Bitcoin and we hold and not panic sell then we will see less fluctuations and price jumps due to lack of supply so bring on the Mt Gox idiot lets buy them all up and hold park your Bitcoin and keep buying then we can get to a price of a million $  soon
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:33:20
So whats the problem with Mt Gox person selling it gave 40 000 noobs a chance to buy a Bitcoin each there are less than 21 million of them wake up people and smell the roses are you investing in something you believe in or are you all just not grown up for this game
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:43:43
Reverse was at $7700 who ever sells now will loose to the strong hands your choice
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:31:13
You welcome learned a lot from Cater Thomas sell a portion at the high when it turns and buy again at the low dont always get it right and learnt my lesson that if you try and play with Bitcoin it will eat you for breakfast so dont get greedy and always keep some money for the lows like now not even the charts can tell me now if we have bottomed out or not currently people are selling on fud instead of buying and the whales are laughing all the way to the exchanges
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:20:14
Agree could test $9500 
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:01:23
Just remember the USA don't control BTC stop acting like the rest of the world will follow your rules Jeff Berwick is right you are all enslaved the rest of the world is laughing at this China don't follow facebook and google so stick the rules from your near bankrupt banks the SEC and your IRS where it fits best, its not relevant to the rest of the world and if you think you control BTC then why are we all so worried about the Mt.Gox Trustee that sold so many Bitcoins you just don't get how Bitcoin works do you?  
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:43:38
Outlook for Monday looks good to break past $10 000 go boy
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:47:13
The more individuals that buy a Bitcoin or a fraction of it we get to join and hold on to it the less we will see price flactuations and whales playing with our money park your Bitcoin in your wallet and let it grow there is billions of people and less than 21 million BTC so lets hold and lets create a demand where we can demand the price by selling fractions and not whole Bitcoins and then the price could go to a million plus $
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:41:03
Give up bud you can't ague with an enslaved American that knows shit that happens outside his country.
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:05:30
Yes and welcome back to our friends from Asia and for the upward move of the price to 10500 keep it up
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:49:05
Idiots from europe selling off no contribution from their side to lift the price they do this every day 
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:02:41
Looks like we bottomed perhaps lol, looking good for an upswing, cetaceans push your buy buttons now.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:45:53
This is bullshit and not applicable to BTC as coins are limited unlike gold and silver with unlimited supply and most these coins are in private hands nice try 
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:15:35
There is more to be taken at $ 20000 
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:30:43
Idiots aside just having fun noticed every time BTC moves up by $1000 the other coins crash so why not help to get rid of the shit coins by luring more people to BTC as they steal our market share due to false promises in these shit coins people are going to loose a ton of �� 
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:36:09
Easter Bunny just told me we could see $9000 by Monday lol
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:57:17

@_date: 2018-03-24 10:21:21
