No such thing as free anything. You either pay for it in taxes or inflation when it's "free". Personally, I'd rather have an option over what services I pay for instead of being forced to fund something.

Keyensians completely ignoring time preference - and reality.

Good. Fuck that cunt. She threatened his life on multiple occaisions BEFORE the dump. Julian had every right to exact revenge on that evil witch. The only people who think WL is no longer an arbiter of truth are those who still believe that it matters which party is in power. WL doesn't care which party is in power and they've ALWAYS had a political agenda of bringing down empires with truth. HRC is just another powerful player in an empire that got what she deserved.

I approve of helping others in need as well. I don't approve of forcing people with the threat of violence to pay for other people's needs. Also, there isn't a single example of free market healthcare on this planet. I challenge you to find one. US healthcare is one of the most regulated markets in the world.

I think y'all need to stop focusing so hard on *trying* to make Bitcoin money. Precious metals didn't come about through a detailed plan by a bunch of merchants and consumers trying to petition and lobby everyone to adopt them as money. It just came about naturally through the spontaneous order of the market. No one had to tell anyone what to do, it simply happened that way because it was meant to be that way, in the long term. If Bitcoin (or any other crypto for that matter) really is the best solution to money, then it will eventually come about regardless of how individuals decide to use it. The only thing you should worry about is keeping government's grubby hands off of it (since government that is *not* a natural market process).
