The issue is the masses got in after 10k. And it’s the masses who are panicking that’s it’s dropping below.

Limited supply?  Tell that to bitcoin cash, or any other potential fork. The idea of limited supply went out the window the second the first fork occurred. They created more supply out of thin air, and gave it a new name.

Well... that is essentially what happened. And that’s a huge problem. The fact that Coinbase is not allowing trades during volatile times is insane.

He’s right. The general public isn’t interested in “overthrowing the institution.”  They want their money, hey want to store their money safely without it potentially being stolen from them, and they want assurance that if somehow it is stolen, they will get it back. Crypto does not provide this. Ask the people who lost thousands of dollars to the various crytpto scams. No one worked to get them their money back, the exchanges basically told them they are shit out of luck. Government insured banks have something going for them that bitcoin never will. Now ethereum....

Yea that’s cool. Bitcoins is  though.

You my friend, are a fucking idiot. 95% of your net worth should not be in crypto.
