Karpeles was ahead of the times but did not have the prescience to step aside on operating and technical decisions as the problems and complexity scaled.  The rush of success was probably intoxicating and blinding.
1) Should have held banking hours for the exchange or closed on weekends after the april crash until the business and code of the exchange was in order.
2) Should have assembled a technical team to take over the code base
3) Should have hired a vetted CEO as mentor ala google &amp; schmidt

Mr. Garzik,
Please let this be the start of a bitcoin group that lists best practices for exchanges by which bread and butter exchanges should be compared to.
A "Joel Code Test" for exchanges for lack of a better comparison.

    Yeah, but did you see that lugers recovery back onto the sled after falling off at 50+ mph?!?
I understand your pains in that if you want to inspire development conversation or technical ideas you are on your own.... that said they are still in bootstrap the community mode and now the olympics are over and the meme "wearing thin" perhaps the conversation will focus on infrastructure and open community driven development efforts.  I think they are only averaging 600 new subs a day now...

It was not a distributed exchange though...  I know of it from its closing.

Sorry, I am subtle to a fault.  It presents a valuation problem to currencies and commodity assets if no one uses them.  If no one used gold, it would not be worth as much.  So if you do plan to use them, get them use them and cash out.  Its that simple and bears the least risk for the whole transaction chain from your wallet to recieiving your goods or service.
@_date: 2014-02-23 09:35:25
With some planning they can make it happen.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:40:31




Well gold is a lot more popular than bitcoins, so you got that going for you.

You can create thin clients in javascript that can:
* 1) Check the balance of an address using a public server
* 2) Create a Transactions specific to that address and coin network
* 3) Send the transaction to a tx processing server like blockchain.info or coinb.in
Its already being done for bitcoin wallets, just need to stand up public servers to process transactions for the other coins and its a done deal.  Donations welcome if you want this done asap : )

TL;DR: 
Gox Behaviour is similar to recent market failures in the futures market.   MF GLobal is a specific example.  Vid speaker says  Gox has to prove that they are solvent, not let users allow money in and no money out.
Goes on to state there are 4 reasons an exchange or broker will not let money move.
1) Insolvent
2) Technical Difficulties
3) Investigation
4) Preventing a run on the accounts
Bottom line; current behaviour is fishy, even more fishy that they are not posting evidence of solvency.

I am working on a lightweight multicurrency wallet
  Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin
  
The goal of the wallet is to make P2P exchanges viable for small transactions without worry of scam or backtrack by the fiat provider by using bitcoin contracts and automate documentation for the coin seller for dispute mediation.
It leverages lightweight UI + public servers like blockchain.info coinbin, and the litecoin and dogecoin equivelents.

The online wallets host the blockchain for you.  If you want a hybrid desktop wallet you can use Multibit or Electrum which allow you desktop access to public servers that hold the blockchain.  I do not know about the nuances of security but the Blockchian.info security looks to be very good and a solid track record. 


You will not loose your coins so long as you have a back up of your private key which can unlock the address you hold your coins at.  If you loose your private key **and** the online service goes down never to to return then you will have lost your coins.

breaking elliptical cryptography would be a bigger problem.
breaking sha-256 would only be bad if the know how was only held by a few vigilante hackers.  The government would probably hurd everyone onto new hashing algo before radicals go too caried away with unhashing secure systems.  It *could become* a devastating problem to modern western economies and markets if hackers could break sha-256 at will... **but easily fixed** by setting a date to change hashing schemes which would provide a 1:1 replacement in most all code ever written... it would be like Y2K.
Elliptical cryptography... if that was broke then bitcoin would be close to shit out of luck.  You cannot replace it as easy as a hashing algorithm.

Cross platform, probably open source bits and pieces.
Paid membership would guarantee more obscure alt coins being added but that said from a development standpoint you can easily spot the pump and dump coins based on the code progress as they rarely keep up with bitcoin protocols for scripting and contracts.

Very proof of concept stages right now.

For funding needs donations or a profitable business plan for investors
