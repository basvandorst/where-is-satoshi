Doesn't matter, if your funds are tied up with Americans, then they're going to be interested in those.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:01:21
how would that solve anything here at all
if you're assassinating someone who's actually in charge of shit then maybe, but really? this situation?

wow I wish everyone were as smart as you dude

You shouldn't have your life savings in it either way.

Regardless of what Lincoln's aims were, the South's aims were the preservation of the institution of slavery. Doesn't matter that Lincoln wasn't seeking emancipation; the South thought he was, so they acted accordingly.

You really need a slapping around the head from a good, empathic mother figure.

It can come in really, really handy though, if you're wanting to take advantage of a temporary low price (or need to pay something like a bill soon), but you won't have sufficient funds until your next paycheck. 
Plus, many (most?) credit cards here *do* have rewards attached to them, in the forms of cash back on purchases, or airline rewards points, etc. 
The way I've always heard to use a credit card responsibly is to *treat* it like a debit card, spending no more money than you have right now (or will have **before** the payment comes due), and immediately pay off the balance from your bank account. The interest is avoidable.

Oh god I freaked out briefly.
And it's not even my money.

or, you know, learning to do things like work and endure and be able to function around other people and in times of stress. Which are basic life skills. But if you don't want them, feel free to give them up.

Mild discomfort detected in users' tones could be used as an indicator that they may be losing confidence or something line that, though, right? Especially if analyzing change in tone over the course of a few days, as compared to some internal model of the market...

the inflation rate in the US has not risen above 2% for any month this year. the last increase above that amount (2.3%) was in April of 2012

Welcome to economics...?
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:17:30
That's so weird to an American eye though.
A comma means "pause", or "transition". A period means "stop" or "new stuff", basically. So the comma means a "pause" in the reading, or "ok, transitioning from millions to thousands", and a period/decimal means "stop. now moving into decimal territory"...

Depends on your income and area. It varies really, really widely, and things like medical expenses can put us behind pretty badly if something unforeseen comes up, for example, because we don't have that kind of thing covered.

Oooh! You can do something like a Wonder Ball/Kinder Surprise, chocolate coin with a paper wallet printed on plastic inside...?
Those would be delicious.

That's bizarre. Even places like Bank of America don't do that, do they? Only fee my girlfriend's ever paid for her account is for incoming wire transactions, overdraft, and maybe use of unaffiliated ATMs.

You get the tech side, but do you fully understand the financial side? Two sides of the ... coin.

There's no reason Americans should commit to Celsius over Fahrenheit. Fahrenheit is better for the subjective experience of temperature (i.e., when talking about weather), but Celsius is better for the scientific perspective (and it is used there, like it should be). 
0 degrees out - really cold weather.
100 degrees out - really hot weather.

Might be worth to have a few different prices listed; a really simple at-a-glance look at the price across different exchanges would be appreciated by me, at least.
