You lost me

I see where youre coming from, but for them to offer a service -that i cannot do myself- in exchange for some data and the chance to TRY and sell me something that I signed off on because I didnt read the terms and agreements doesnt seem so bad... What a world we live in. I am slowly giving my life away.. call me crazy because I like convenience.

Funny sarcasm in the beginning... In response to the other half of your post: I totally agree!! I understood the significance of bitcoin and what It can become, but it wasnt until I actually had some (from the donations) that Im now personally invested in this thing now and I need to see it work out.

Could you elaborate the risk(s)? I get that if a company is for profit it will act in the best interest of itself, but if im receiving tips and thats all, whats the harm/risk?
