It may be slower _now_ but that doesn't mean it's "pointless."  The fact that you can express yourself in this manner in the first place is amazing to me. Bitcoin supports art... I digress. 
Point is, your fee will support the miner of your choice and we're free to do this outside of control.  That's powerful in and of itself. With enough users you can make a statement. Or it may not. It still wouldn't make it "pointless." Not all transactions need to be confirmed instantly.

Apparently everybody ITT doesn't think SegWit is a direct scaling solution.  Further down you write:


I disagree.  
**SegWit is linear scaling of sighash operations**
A major problem with simple approaches to increasing the Bitcoin blocksize is that for certain transactions, signature-hashing scales quadratically rather than linearly.
Segwit resolves this by changing the calculation of the transaction hash for signatures so that each byte of a transaction only needs to be hashed at most twice. This provides the same functionality more efficiently, so that large transactions can still be generated without running into problems due to signature hashing, even if they are generated maliciously or much larger blocks (and therefore larger transactions) are supported.
**Block capacity/size increase**
Since old nodes will only download the witness-stripped block, they only enforce the 1 MB block size limit rule on that data. New nodes, which understand the full block with witness data, are therefore free to replace this limit with a new one, allowing for larger block sizes. **Segregated witness therefore takes advantage of this opportunity to raise the block size limit to nearly 4 MB, and adds a new cost limit to ensure blocks remain balanced in their resource use (this effectively results in an effective limit closer to 1.6 to 2 MB).**

SegWit fixes all of that you mentioned with a softfork...
@_date: 2017-02-11 20:47:45
It is indeed open and visible. And there are currently max connections connected to it. 
As I suspected, maxconnections prevent it from being seen with scripts like this unless it can connect to it. 
No big deal, just might skew the numbers one way or another. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 12:41:15
But they do run their processors 24/7 creating money out of thin air.
@_date: 2017-02-12 14:54:34
You're speaking on behalf of all users.  Again, not all transactions need to be immediate.
It's not about using this particular script.  Wallets can implement (optional) functions like this and the user can decide.  That's the nature of innovation.  I'm glad not everybody sees things like this as "pointless."
Bitcoin is programmable money.  Not everything is going to be "groundbreaking."

@_date: 2016-01-29 14:49:43


There's your problem.  Redditors are pushing for a hardfork NOW.


This is true.  If a hardfork were to occur and your transaction is picked up on the hardfork and not the other chain, then you will lose money.  If you roll back to the other chain it's only as good as the transactions it accepted.

Blacklisting.  Basically you can trace where a bitcoin came from and program your node to not accept transactions if it originated from a certain address.  This can prove dangerous overtime and removes fungibility from Bitcoin.  That's why privacy is important.

The Charlie Shrem quote on the front page. On mobile or I'd find it for you. It was a tweet I believe. 
The FB comment left out the fact that Very called cloud mining a scam in the past and now he's offering it.

The Hong Kong agreement was a problem in the first place.  Meeting with the miners at all isn't required in this system.

Thank you for this!  The stellaw link is really interesting.  I'll reach out to the author.
The Java Cards are really cool too.  Thanks for these links, I have something to research over the weekend :)

Just like they're OK with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-09-19 22:56:07
Agreed, because of fees.  At least move it to a weekly purchase if OP can't afford a monthly purchase.

We can learn from our predecessors: hoard and rationing food, fixing instead of buying new, and penny-pinching instead of frivolous spending.  


Mindsets like these will reset.  Inflationary currency is NOT the norm it has been made out to be.  For as old as money is, fractional reserve banking is fairly new.

It seems like fiat promotes consumerism and not a healthy relationship with money.

Where did any of this data come from?  Sources?  I see a lot of network speed assumptions (both data and conclusions).

I was wondering the same thing.  This was the first scam I've received on this account.
@_date: 2015-09-10 12:12:22
I see that you need the card to confirm spending.
Question: if you already have the ledger app paired on your phone will it still use that in lieu of the card?
@_date: 2015-09-10 16:53:55
Thanks for that!  I just didn't want to risk it because it does look like it will wear and tear.  I'll look into duplicating it before I carry it :)

If you watch the Ver vs Mow video, you'll see Ver calls Mow out for not listening to CSW's talk and that he had relevant arguments.  Vitalik then calls out his arguments.
Ver clearly takes CSW's side before Vitalik calls out the fraud.  
Here's the relevant part:

Not OP, but


Also, that's the *only* mention of "blockchain" in the blog.

Bummer.  That card scares me - it seems as if the lettering can easily scratch off.  It really limits the ability of carrying it around.

They do.  I believe now they make you pay with paypal, etc., first because of abuse through anonymity.  
However, I believe if you open a support ticket or get referred you can pay with BTC first.  I still used Vultr without having ever used paypal (grandfathered I guess).

Everybody give up!  Nobody wants to accept bitcoin, it was fun while it lasted.

But how will plants breathe?
All jokes aside... if you believe Bitcoin will usurp the traditional banking "industry"... then it'll replace all the banksters.  All the big buildings downtown using electricity, all the employees in those buildings using computers, all the employees commuting to work, etc...
The electricity argument is dumb to me.  If we have a fair money and fair competition, there might be big breaks in the energy industry.

If I recall correctly, those charges were dropped.  I believe you're just as damned if you're accused of something rather than if you actually committed the crime.

This reminds me of a TV show I saw awhile ago (way before Bitcoin) on National Geographic, Discovery, or something like that.  I wish I could find it :/
It was talking about the future of cars and impending automation of them.  Instead of using cameras on top like Google does now, it was using some sort of electronic insert into the ground.  The car would be able to read these and navigate better.
But I do remember it mentioning the ability to automatically pay the driver in front of you to let you by because you might be in a bigger hurry than them.  It stuck out in my mind as a really cool concept.  As a kid, I took a different approach in my thinking...  I would purposely have my car drive slow everywhere so I could make nice profits.

Please don't take this reply as arguing for one side or the other.  But I simply want to point out your mistake in logic.
A chain split != a hardfork.  Nor is UASF a hard fork (notice the SF = soft fork).  Chain splits happen all the time and blocks get orphaned.  A hard fork is around the software itself.

Ok, redditor for 1 week.  Not my first rodeo. I'll check back in when it's under your 2200-2350 best price.  I'm sure you'll have something to say about that too.

If you have 1 oz of gold that's worth $1400 today but it drops to $700 tomorrow, do you have 2 oz of gold?
Owning 21 bitcoins is owning 21 bitcoins.  Just like gold, your amount stays the same but the value increases / decreases.
