The joke is people dont think technical analysis "works". What they fail to realise is that its not the technical analysis that is failing them it is their stupid trading decisions and then they blame technical analysis :) 
This just highlights the level of skill in this sub reddit xD none of the comments are to be taken seriously ��

I have seen some good analysis here also :) seen some pathetic analysis at the same time. You just have to have some level of knoweldge to understand whats good and whats bad. Those that say TA "doesnt work" have no idea about trading or investing let alone their own psychological problems :P

The real analysts dont make predictions , they say where the market is likely tk head on both sides....its up to the trader to make the damn trading decision lol. People these days just want to be told when to click to buy and when to click again to sell. If this isnt provided the TA is shambles
