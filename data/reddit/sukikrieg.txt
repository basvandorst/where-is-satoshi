Well one can buy a $1 cup of coffee with BCH for $1.000000001 dollars worth of cypto.  Something that cannot be done with BTC.  One spends like cash the other is apparently for HODLING

The difference is now when they are made aware of crypto there is a lot of better alternatives.  What's the value of bitcoin?  The moment it started being a "Store of value" and not money is the moment a now maturish etherium becomes a better choice.  BitcOin shot itself in the leg when somehow people stopped thinking of it as money and started calling it a store of value.  What your seeing is traders dumpling bitcoin for other better stores of value.  So I guess some people got what they wanted.  Bitcoin is just another store of value.

Yeah the 200 + 20k is the law.  (Passed inside Obama care btw) however John Doe lawsuit was only for over 20k so the irs sued for informantion that wasn't even required by law and won...... Chew on that the next time you go vote.

It's worse than that. The judge ruled that Coinbase had to do tHings that were not even required by law.  The 1099k had a two step trigger and the IRS sued Anonymously to get the Information on transactions that had only triggered one of the steps.  The judge ruled Coinbase had to do tHings not even required by law.  The law states 200 AND 20k.  The judgement was for just 20k.  All animals are equal only some animals are more equal than others.......
