Some think being an early adopter earns you the "Bitcoin Specialist",  when most of these early adopters don't understand shit about the "protocol".... clowns.
BTW: this doesn't mean that we don't have problems, There are a lot of problems to fix and scaling the most urgent one.

Bitcoin will do its thing, you can't hold it up or down, the best you can do is just not invest more than you are comfortable to lose because you will get emotional and you will write up stuff like this on public forums.
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:05:52
I don't know if this will be comforting to you but I will say it anyways, we are at the stage of "then they fight you", I know it is inconvenient to you, especially when things like this comes as a surprise, most people are not prepared for surprises but I assure you, we are getting close to wining. 
hold on there, they laughed at us now they are fighting us but we will win...

yes, if you still see your balance on coinbase then you don't have to worry about anything, it is security measure they take to secure customers funds, they keep on few % of the bitcoins on their hot-wallet for daily use, all other funds goes to a secure offline wallet which is called cold-wallet.
it is Ok to leave a small amount for daily use on third party companies like coinbase, but for your long term investment you should follow the same practice, make a paper wallet or generate an address on an offline system and use that address for your long term holdings. if you dont control the address then you own only a balance, the same as of IOU in banks. 
I would suggest Armory as a wallet take a look at it.

here is the tip I got before 1000 bits @_date: 2014-02-27 19:27:29
So what do you know that the community doesn't ? and why aren't you sharing that with the community ? funny how top known bitcoiners telling the community "it is done forget Mtgox and forgot funds" 
I didn't lose a single satoshi but I don't think it is done, it just started, the Bitcoin community needs it to be cleaned out and with force, we don't need such players anymore...
Some people will have their life destroyed with this event, this is not SR and this is not SR2.0 and this is not some shady theft, this was one of the oldest Bitcoin companies, one of the companies that helped bitcoin become where it is at today, and if this was the biggest lie in the Bitcoin history, then I am sorry but I am sure we will discover even many more.
And please don't give me the "never invest what you cant afford what to lose" some poor people saw Bitcoin as a saver, they believed and they had faith, and now their life is being destroyed... 
Amazing how an really early adopter who bought ten thousands of coins at less then a dollar who supposedly lost 500 tell them sorry but just move on, yes maybe you can move on, but no others cant,  the other one advocated mtgox 7 months ago and hes said "I assure you that mtgox is really fine and looking to many statements and documents they really are having problems with their bank..." came back to tell us sorry I was just doing them a favor, yes you helped them fuck people, you are a partner of that crime...
If we just forget and move on, then yea Bitcoin is a PONZI and no regulation is its heaven but No I am not buying anything I am being told now and I call for heavy regulation....

some of Bitcoin Devs have to really stop being so defensive when it comes to Litecoin, I was following development through the last year and I saw amazing support from the Litecoin Devs team and community to help Bitcoin, Litecoin is not a competing coin with Bitcoin, I hold both of the coins and personally I would consider holding only these 2 coins and nothing else at the moment:  (sorry I am looking for the blog post by warren where he pointed a vulnerability in the Bitcoin code, but didnt want to say what it was, I cant find yet, I will update when I do) 
Litecoin OMG is a branch containing many experimental patches, features and performance improvements that seem to work but are not yet included in Litecoin because we are not sure if they are safe.  Some of these patches are experimental improvements written for Litecoin, or backports of patches for 0.9 that are not yet approved for inclusion in Bitcoin 0.9.  It is very important that these patches are tested and for problems to be reported, this helps to stabilize features that will be in future versions of both Bitcoin and Litecoin.
Please submit Issues, code review comments or Pull Requests to the github branch exp-0.8.5.1-omg2.
OMG Faster!
OMG2 64bit Linux was measured as ~22% faster in reindex performance to height=400000 than 0.8.5.1 when both clients were run with -dbcache=1000.  32bit OMG2 will not be much faster yet because SSE2 runtime detection is not yet implemented.  Please support Litecoin devs to help us work on improvements like this.
Litecoin 0.8.5.1 is a very important bug fix update for the negative tx version issue that can cause the client to erroneously think the database is corrupt and thus fail to start.  This is a very serious bug that effects all previous versions of Litecoin thus everyone must upgrade.
An advanced feature heading to bitcoin-0.9 is the ability to disable the wallet of a bitcoind node.  Disabling the wallet reduces the memory use of the daemon by anywhere between 40MB and 200MB.  These nodes are useful in at least these ways.
The huge memory savings better enables the ability to deploy relay-only nodes on the smallest hardware or Virtual Machines.
p2pool or pool nodes do not require a wallet as mining payouts can be to a target address that is managed by a wallet on another machine.
One fix in particular may be of interest is a rare block index LevelDB corruption issue that happened for MacOS X users.  Only Bitcoin 0.8.x users have been reporting that bug, but Litecoin would be similarly affected so we are testing the potential fix.  This issue was annoying but non-fatal for MacOS X users as they would occasionally need to reindex to recover.  Hopefully now they can avoid that annoyance.
Fixed rare issue involving relay of invalid transactions.
Fixed rare MacOS X crash during GUI send.
Fixed the MacOS X leveldb corruption issue.
More informative debug.log messages about peers and messages.
Timestamps enabled by default in debug.log.
Faster Block Sync or Reindexing
You can make initial block download or -reindex much faster by running litecoin-qt or litecoind with the -dbcache=X parameter, where X is a number in megabytes you want to dedicate to the dbcache.  The default is 25MB which is fine for normal operation, but your reindexing of the entire blockchain can be much faster if you give it a higher number like 500 or 1000.  Remove -dbcache after your 0.8 is fully upgraded and synchronized with the blockchain to reduce your memory requirements.

The Bubble stage graph is unbelievably accurate, most of users doesn't really know where to look, we are talking about the very long term price, the one since the introduction of Bitcoin, so you have to look at 1W chart... [here how it looks](

to be honest, the average user can take some time to understand the concept of this innovation (bitcoin) which is nothing wrong, the same as internet, it took some time for people to understand how it will revolutionize the way we communicate but it made it...


you should do what you believe is right, no one said you should start using it... but maybe you are missing a hell of a ride this is what I think 


I did ask the same question when I didnt understand what was bitcoin and BTW it was worth few US dollars at the time !
 


I am sure you didn't take time to try to understand Bitcoin as a technology, you were looking only to the price... you have to take some time to understand it and then come back  and tell us what you think about the whole thing, I personally don't care that much if the price will crash to half now because I am a long term believer

he confirmed telling "I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it" so she didn't lie here, also this means that he knew about what she was talking about, this guy is not dumb....
see in this Video he said " i have nothing with developing, I was just an engineer doing something else"  so he knew about the developing part.
but the funnier thing is that here he said : " I have nothing to do with Bitcoin, I never worked for the company...."  so now Bitcoin is a company?

agreed, after writing my comment I had to go back and compare the code, I do apologize for crediting the Litecoin Dev team directly. my confusion was in the early implementation in Litecoin than Bitcoin, so there is that.
as for competition, I really don't know about others, I didn't yet meet anyone who is 100% Litecoin fanatic, at least the people I know all holds Bitcoin first and Litecoin second or I can speak for my self and say at least I dont see it that way.
 
I do hold both coins and only these 2, I only remember Litecoin and namecoin being the only 2 alts back when I joined the community, each coin had something to offer, maybe nothing technical but the user base and markets are really different and I love that. 
other than that I have nothing to add, we all know that if Bitcoin fail because of a technical issue, basically everything else will follow. not only the technical issues, but also the legal/fundamental...
now, personally and I don't want to make this general because I don't know what others think, I love new experiments, it is the reason why I first got into Bitcoin, but I have to admit that the number of scam coins is just worrying, I cant keep up with all this junk, I came to a point that I dont care anymore about experimenting or even reading about new coins because 98% are just scam attempts.
I dont usually give any financial advice to anyone, but if I am asked and my friends insisted to give an answer I say invest into Bitcoin or Litecoin...  
@_date: 2014-03-16 14:42:46

Except that the 2 largest addresses are from exchanges (BTC-e, OKcoin), and the 230 and 2100 addresses (1000-100000 LTC)  seems really fair number compared to Bitcoin, the majority of Litecoin holders are based from 0-10000 and this represent more than 70% of all outstanding Litecoins

as I recall, when bitstamp applied for a Business licence they chosen " menjalnica" which means "money exchange", their business information were available on AJPS all the time till mid 2013 when they chose to move their business to UK for better AML and KYC appliance, they kept their bank account here in Slovenia with Unicredit bank because they've built a really strong partnership with their bank through the years.
I think the issue of OP is not whether Bitstamp is regulated properly, because I am sure that Bitstamp is one of the best regulated Bitcoin businesses out there,  but it is about an exclusive partnership with their bank that the bank is not willing to admit.
 I have an account with Unicredit bank Slovenia and I told them repeatedly and many times that I do deal with Bitcoin as a costumer and I was more then welcome, in fact I've even got one of their best packages and they've never bothered me, and I did many deposited in 5 figures and they never complicated things.

I am really really pissed off, I cant believe how much ignorant this community has became really, I was expecting a drop in the hash power of that pool when I woke up, just to see that they are calmed down and everything is the same all because of an "official statement" from Ghash.IO  "don't worry we wont fuck your wives and kids when we reach 51%"
this is called horse shit, they did double spend @ 23% and nothing is preventing them from doing so now, they shouldn't have more than 33% ( read the selfish miner) neither any other pool no mater how honest the operator is, you never put trust on any individual it must be distributed equally among everyone on the network.. the is what Bitcoin as concept came to solve...
"it is ok" , "it is not 51% yet" "they are honest" "who would destroy their business model"  well I guess you think the same about your banks, it is now that we do something about it or it is too late.... 
@_date: 2014-01-15 11:51:29
So I will try to summarize the conclusion, at least what I understood, before that I have to point out that the discussion was really productive and objective in a positive way, the senate and his board asked really good questions, and got really smart answers as well :
* it is not clear what they will do next or how to regulate bitcoin  but they want to catch up and making it illegal is not an option.
* it seems that adopting Bitcoin will be a competition between powerful countries as USA, Germany, UK and now France to follow.
* they know that there is a real innovation behind bitcoin and France is already missing the train.
* how Bitcoin will benefit users.
* the senate and his board doesn't fully understand the decentralized and the distributed concept and he asked who owns the protocol ? and "no one" as an answer was not enough clear for him even though they tried to explain the protocol in a simple way.
* the illicit use was brought up, which is something normal, but I didn't have the feeling that they focused negatively on this.
* volatility and investment risk also was brought up, but one of the board members said that it is due speculation, and said that speculation is good to a certain point....
* Europe Bitcoin foundation will be born! 
the general Idea I've got is that they know they cant keep ignoring Bitcoin, they have to jump in and adopt it, but they don't know in which class bitcoin fits.

few days ago I sent a letter to human resources letting them know that I am quitting my job. it took me few months to decide and I have to admit that I had to test my faith in bitcoin because of the price dropping and all the negative noise going around, but I did it anyways.
I still have to wait few months before leaving, my contract have a 3 months leaving window but I somehow managed to decrease it to 2 months, the interesting part is that I work for a world wide company (Goodyear) I work as an IT Operations engineer and when I sent them the letter they called me for hearings, of course they had to know about why I am leaving and if there is anything bothering me or if I am not happy with my job and the conditions, and of course I was answering every question with no, which made them even more curious, I told the women that I am moving forward with my life and I want to work with Bitcoin and help building the infrastructure and community around it, she asked me if it was because of material purpose, and I said it was yes it is also a reason why I decided to leave, then she said may I ask you how much you were offered at Bitcoin ? hahahaha
after having a laugh I explained the whole thing, spent 1 hour and a half at that meeting and guess what we've got  new bitcoiner.
I didn't decide what I will do with my Bitcoin career yet, but I am sure that I will figure that out as soon as I get free and have some time, I am not afraid because bitcoin is still young and there is allot of opportunities out there to be discovered and so many businesses to be built.

nope, you are watching the trading volume up there, and it is not made up. the bubble chart shows all cryptocoins and their total trading volume summarized of all exchanges for the last 24 hours on it. The volume is denominated in BTC. Other second currencies like USD, EUR and LTC are getting calculated back to BTC to show the right data. Mouseover the bubbles to see the exact volume
I've bought my Bitcoins at less than $55/coin, most of them were bought at 10-15 USD, I hold a fine amount that I resigned my IT daily job to work just with Bitcoin, but the difference between me and most of the posters here is that I use common sense and I tend to not be fanatic or get emotionally attached to anything.
I use my brain and I do analyze things before deciding anything, and I've wrote the article not for the reason to pump Litecoin and make Bitcoin looks bad, but I tended to wirte about things that are facts.
many of you seemed to ignore the mtgox BS, it is not only mtgox the number of stolen coins in one year is much larger than what satoshis hold and this really concerns me...

simply because the information is stored in the blockchain in every computer all around the world, and each node have the info about how much you have on that address... you can check your balance after every transaction on

I can rely to your story, I had almost the same experience with my Job, instead of a shitty boss I had two co-workers always nagging me especially when Bitcoin hit ATH and was all over the news, they kept asking me if I am going to quit my job, and started treating me like shit( I guess they were jealous) anyway, we didn't get along even before.
So early last year I sent a hilarious reassignment letter, my boss (which I convinced to buy Bitcoin) asked me to stay at least until I find another Job or when I have my own project launched, he even offered me a road-map to get promoted but I refused, my mind was made up and that was it, it was my last word.... to be honest I have days of regret but then I remember some of the assholes I worked with and that regret turn to be happiness.
At first I sold 1/3 of my holdings to be able to live off it the next year, but in May 2014 I knew this ship was not going anywhere so I sold all of the rest ... I've been living off that money, and man I can tell you, easy come easy go.
I think I made so many bad decisions, for example I lost a big part of that money on shitty start up investments, some of my BTC got stolen because I trusted people i shouldn't trust in the first place...but I wont complain so much, because I did good as well, I helped my parents to fix their home, paid my wife college debts and paid some consumer loans I took before, bought my kids electronics they did dream to have before (PCs, tablets)... but now the funds are drying up, soon I will have to find a job.
The only thing I really regret is quitting my job that way,  should been be smarter about it, I guess there are positives to that but the negatives outweigh them, for example I could survive from my salary (as usual) and  save the money I made from Bitcoin to be a part of a plan to buy a house.... this was a wild experience for me.

[conspiracy] maybe when the feds seized the SR Bitcoins they actually seized MTgox coins, because it doesn't make sense that the SR had that number of coins...[/conspiracy]

I visited Bitstamp summer of 2013 (before they got investment from VC) and they had at least 15 employees at the time, not long after my visit they started recruiting more people.
now the company is Based in the UK, their main offices with the CEO and most of the staff are based in Luxembourg, and their support team and dev team sits here in Kranj, Slovenia.
maybe they are not a corporate yet, but they are starting to be a one... the only thing that really bothered me is their arrogant attitude, somehow they forgot that they were just a lucky 3 guys who were at the right time and right place and it didn't really take that much of talent, when gox was dying it was either bitstamp or Btc-e, naturally everyone choose the safer option which was them at the time...besides,Kodrič (CEO) always wears this shirt with the green stamps "zero excuses" motto on it... that motto has just turned against them.

Sorry, but your screen shot just proves that even you are a professional and you think that you've caught the bottom or an amateur and you have no idea what you are doing, and I think it is the latter.
 you should be buying in batches across a long period of time (weeks) to average your cost, now if the price will fall further (which is highly possible) you will have to sell to lower your risk, what you are doing now is good only for exchanges (taking more fees) and help increasing volatility.
anyway, good luck.

I am really curious, where do that transaction comes from ? I am starting to believe that this address is not related to the hack...

I totally Agree with this post, but I think you are expressing your opinion in the wrong place, most of people here are just a bunch of biased subjective cultist that don't want to hear what doesn't serve their books.

I wish for Bitcoin to hit low double digits (and I think it will anyway) so we shake all the speculators cultists idiots.

I will tell you what that tweet means, it is a cry of fear...I did notice that every time the price crash Barry Silbert and other "bag holders" come of nowhere and tweet similar tweets.
The guy is just shitting his pants, after all the attempts to pump the price it is now going down, try to be in his shoes.... same goes for the fool Winklevoss twins.

Please, don't spam him with questions about Bitcoin! the guy was asked so many times and has already answered the same questions, [besides, he already talked about the mobile and digital payments on this year's annual letter]( 
I really admire what Bill and Melinda gates are doing, it is amazing watching their earned wealth helping the people who really needs it, instead of spamming him with Bitcoin related nonsense try to thank him for the work he is doing, ask him about it more and try to find out how you can help (if you really care about helping the poor).
**Remember:** Bitcoin's decentralization and blockchain technology and whatnot is the last thing these poor countries worry about, most of sub Saharan African and south Asians nations worry about the simplest things that most of us take for granted, such as food and clean water, not to mention the high fatality rate because of diseases which developed nation forgot what they are...this is why Bill Gates is coming to Reddit for AMA, he doesn't really care about pumping your investment. 
**Edit:** corrected Melinda and not Amanda :D

I would like to point out something regarding the "fraudulent " transaction, I know that CC companies are over monitoring transactions, sometimes they even freeze/block legit transactions/accounts if they think they are suspicious, although I don't know how they define a suspicious transaction (they cant tell you because their system wouldn't make any sense if you knew how it works) .... but the last time I went to a local Bitcoin meeting arranged by Bitstamp here in Kranj-Slovenia, they did mention that they are working with regulators and they are looking for a solution (and would pay good for it)  that kind of analyze the blockchain transactions to filter fraudulent and suspicious transactions that involve stolen coins, or coins that were used in any illicit activity.
 
Knowing how coins can quickly change hands and how long( time and chain) you can track a transaction, Bitcoin wont be better than CC companies in that sense, because a company like Bitstamp/Bitpay/coinbase can block/freeze your account with the money in it if they can relate your coins to any suspicious transaction, even if you are innocent and the illicit transaction took years ago.
example: you do business with someone who was related to the Bitstamp Hack, maybe the coins changed hands 5-10 times before you got them, but when you try using one of these services (that will be using this Blockchain analyzes) they will just freeze your account and ask for proof/evidence of the origin of the coins... now good luck explaining to them that you are not related to the hack.

Even if you don't store coins there, you will be paying a merchant who use one of these services... and shit will eventually hit you.
Many of people here don't realize that the freedom that Bitcoin offered a couple of years ago when it was a small geeky thing will be lost with regulation. 
Edit: Mixing the coins will make even worse for everybody else.

I visited it only once and I think it was in 2012, and I remember plenty of drugs and few weapons, but at the time of the bust in 2013 when it was on the news everyone was talking about weapons, hitmen, drugs and child porn, stolen credit cards, fake IDs and passports... I never had the chance to verify because the site was offline at the time.

I dont know why most of you keep insisting that free markets and Bitcoin are going to save the African nations.... I lived 20 years of my Life in Africa... I got to experience things first hand, and let me tell you, when the vast majority of the population think all the time about what to feed their kids and how to get clean water and how to not get sick with diseases that most of our nations forgot about, then they don't have time to learn about our nonsense and how Bitcoin works, not to mention their infrastructure (if it exist at all )is completely unprepared to adopt such systems, and the money that could to these infrastructures should be invested in hospitals, schools, and local farms.
These people don't have the luxury to think about exploring, investing in complex solutions to make their life easier, when fighting hunger and sickness take the biggest part of their daily lives.
The majority of African nations are living in Chaos for decades (since the colonists left), colonists like Great Britain and France used the natives as their slaves to extract the natural wealth on their home lands for centuries, then they left them with no education, no infrastructure and unprepared for running their states them selves.... so it is not only the fuck up nor the fault of Africans them selves.

Haven't you seen the block sizes lately? I run a Business that relies completely on making blockchain transactions, I removed bitcoin support at the time of the 'stress test' brought it back later and now I am thinking about removing it again.
I can't express how many complains we do get when transactions are hours late... not to mention that our system is on hold when few transactions are stuck (because of change addresses).
Bitcoin is failing as a payment system... period.

Bitcoin is dead was always about price speculation, but this time it is different... Bitcoin is struggling while we are watching and most of us can't do anything about it.

Don't be a fool.. SR was all about money, just a reminder, the site wasn't a "decentralized platform" but it was controlled/owned by Ross Ulbricht, they charged a fee for escrow, sales, accounts... and had paid mods that managed the daily operations and made sure the site would function normally.

Well, if you don't see any problem with child porn, identity theft,  illegal weapons (or weapons in general in fact), organized crime... then for sure you won't see any problem from exploiting it for profits. 
Whether you are straight or gay or bisexual and whether you use drugs or not it remains your personal freedom/problem call it as you wish (although the latter means that you are an idiot IMO, but this is a long debate and I don't have time to discuss it here), everything else that effects not only you but also people's lives in a negative way shouldn't be allowed. 
You can argue about your personal freedom and space, but I don't want to live in a world where my kids are used sexually or where my identity is being stolen or where you can hire someone to kill me for any reason or where my life is danger because of your freedom... if this is your definition of freedom and liberty, then I don't wish to live in the same society with your kind of people.

Fight the cause and not the symptoms of the problem, to end the terrorism problem you have to fight the Ideologies that create terrorists... even if that means fighting a religion in some (or many) cases... Just remember, people can survive and live in peace and love without religion, but religion can't survive without people.
I am not a libertarian, in fact I do not believe in that concept in many ways, but to blame encryption for terrorism as a way to take the right of privacy, that is just a shady business.

this means it was a double spend, someone who sent a transaction of that amount and double spend it somehow check here 
edit the good thing is that that try of double spending was a failure, the one who tried to take the coins will never have them because the transaction is still not confirmed yet( for 9 months), and maybe will never be confirmed

because of weak hands, people who react with emotions and people who invest too much of money that they cant afford to lose, this is why.
today statement was really positive, if you followed bitcoin news for some time you would know that, Bitcoin was not in the black nor the white area in China it was not officially addressed, so we call it gray area, people were buying/selling and trading it on their own risk, and this statement clarify that bitcoin is legal for individuals and it should be treated as commodity (like gold) and people will trade on their own risk as it was before, nothing has changed except the ban for organisations and companies which is understandable if you know the local law there  
@_date: 2013-10-10 16:41:34
I am thinking that the OP doesn't have a verified account, it was stated on their news page that only verified members will be able to trade and all unverified accounts will be closed, so i am guessing this is the case
