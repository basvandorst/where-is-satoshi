I'd say it's on the man not to grab women and drag them around or grope them. Not knowing where the line is, is not an excuse. It's absolutely not okay to *grab a woman's waist and drag her into a gropey hug* because you didn't know she wouldn't appreciate it. That's the dude's failing, it's not "on the woman" to teach him not to grope.
Also, wtf, we can't judge the meetup because of what happened, because this man is solely responsible for his own actions, but somehow the woman is also responsible for his actions because she didn't call them out? All the other men who didn't call this out bear no responsibility, but the victim does?

Observing that there are more men than women in IT ≠ observing that women are not interested in IT.

How do I know that it's not okay for me to punch you, if you haven't called me out on it? I know because it's my responsibility to learn about people's right to control what happens with their own body, and then to not violate that. It's not up to women to tell men in advance not to assault them.

You are often fairly physical women? How often do you become fairly physical women?
If you aren't trolling, it's very sad that you're unable to notice that women don't like to be assaulted.

So you think sexual assault is showing affection? Riiiiiight.
Women and men alike enjoy affection. Most people do not enjoy a stranger sexually assaulting them. You are foul if you think that women should appreciate being assaulted because it means someone desires them. You should appreciate me kicking you in the face because it means I find you a desirable victim for a face-kicking.
