I know you are getting swarmed with hate, but I will offer you actual advice given your present situation.
1.  Disclose your situation with your sister.  Your family is worth a lot more than 750k.  She'll find out eventually and you will risk a lawsuit within what's left of your family, and she'll never speak to you again.  If you do it now, there's still a chance things will work out for you two.
2.  Allocate a portion of the cash for your sister's 4 year tuition... in a conservative fund.  Student loan is expensive and financially debilitating.  You do not want to risk your sister's future any further.  
3.  Understand that there's no get rich scheme.  In the long run, the best way to make money is to have even more money.  There is no winning strategy in any investment.  After risk adjustment for its volatility, bitcoin doesn't provide any higher return than traditional venues.
4.  Handling a lot of money takes a lot of discipline and you clearly have none of that.  You need to build a balanced portfolio and not everything into bitcoin.  
Lastly, I would like to reiterate that there's no such thing as a guaranteed winning strategy.  You need to manage your risk and grow your wealth with time.  Do not day trade anymore.  You are still young and even if you made 10x return on whatever you have left, it won't be enough to sustain you through retirement.
Take a day job and put your money in an investment account. 750k is not a lot of money.  You are not rich.  Stop dreaming.
