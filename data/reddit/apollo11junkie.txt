I'm getting ready to dive in, but having trouble finding a good no-KYC BTM in the area. There are a few, but their fees are in the 10-15% range. What is a good no-KYC way to buy besides a BTM? (Noob here, thanks)
@_date: 2019-11-22 04:00:53
What about "quantum supremacy?"

Can I download to my Trezor directly or do I have to download it to my account wallet, then transfer it to my hardware wallet?
@_date: 2019-11-09 02:57:04
I'm planning on taking my Trezor out of the safe and connecting it over the weekend.
@_date: 2019-11-09 04:37:51
I thought a benefit of BTMs is anonymity. Giving your tel number and gov't ID defeats the purpose, doesn't it?
@_date: 2019-11-22 00:57:43
Ah, of course! :)
@_date: 2019-11-09 03:02:23
I'll check them out, thanks!

Thanks for the info. How does accepting crypto on Craigslist enable me to buy it without KYC?
@_date: 2019-11-06 01:02:00
Can you withdraw directly to a hardware wallet, or do you have to first download it to your account's online wallet, then transfer?
@_date: 2019-11-19 21:05:17
Noob here trying to decide when to jump in, but that's horrifying! :)
@_date: 2019-11-23 23:05:53
Agree 100%. I'm trying to figure out why Xi would promote it. I think he'd be the last person who wants blockchain.
@_date: 2019-11-21 07:10:35
Interesting it's number one.
@_date: 2019-11-09 05:57:27
They confirm the transaction by text to your cell.
@_date: 2019-11-06 01:17:39
Do you know of a good site to locate ATMs?
@_date: 2019-10-29 05:33:08
That's disappointing, I was getting ready to put the trigger on Binance (I'm in the US). Which would you suggest that's similar?
@_date: 2019-10-29 05:30:03
Dealing P2P with someone I don't know is risky, but are Bitcoin ATM's risky too?
@_date: 2019-10-29 03:29:11
Can Xi use blockchain to his advantage somehow, by exclusion? I can't see how that might pan out. My first thought was  what incentive would an autocrat have for anything peer to peer?
@_date: 2019-10-29 04:19:46
Good info, thanks. The last I heard of Coinbase was in 2017 when I gave up trying to open an account because it was taking months. Are they any better now, or is an exchange like Binance better overall (for smaller investments)?
@_date: 2019-10-29 04:02:16
I bought a Trezor in 2017 but never used it. Is it still a good HW wallet? I'm wondering the best way to buy. Cash sounds good, but don't like the risk.
@_date: 2019-10-29 03:26:46
@_date: 2019-12-27 02:56:27
So then is there really a difference between BTMs and Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-12-25 00:05:14
Agree. I'm wondering from more of a defensive position, in a security and privacy sense. I don't think we even know their capabilities.
@_date: 2019-12-27 02:21:30
Good info, thanks. I'm not thrilled signing up with a big broker.
@_date: 2019-12-24 00:41:54
Is it true Tor was developed by, or has a backdoor, installed by the NSA?
@_date: 2019-12-24 02:28:05
Do you think Tor is more secure than the options under NordVPN?
@_date: 2019-12-26 22:15:33
I'll call ahead before going. How about fees? I've seen them up to 17%!
@_date: 2019-12-27 22:25:54
What's a dex?
@_date: 2019-12-29 21:12:09
Good info, thanks. Here's my question on KYC: Is it easier to buy BCH without KYC, and then transfer to BCT anonymously?
@_date: 2019-12-30 17:41:32
@_date: 2019-12-24 17:40:53

I'm researching  It looks good, but wondering if it's truly no-KYC. Does anyone know? Thanks.
@_date: 2019-12-28 21:02:41
Ah, ok. Do these two DEXs require KYC?
@_date: 2019-12-27 04:09:50
I hear they're now KYC.
@_date: 2019-12-25 05:03:51
I'm testing Bitwarden, but I'm concerned about the single point of failure vulnerability of the master password. Which do you think is more secure, manually entering a 15 character password to each website or using that 15 character password as the master password for a vault, and let Bitdefender create a random 25 character password?
@_date: 2019-12-25 05:45:16
According to  my password would take 320 quadrillion years to crack. 8O

Nice. I'm getting ready to pull the trigger on BTC, and KYC anonymity is important. How do BTMs  work? What personal info do I need to give? Eg, do I need to give my real email, address, cell number to authenticate, 2FA...?
