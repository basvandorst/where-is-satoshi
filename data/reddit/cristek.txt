I'm sorry to keep bothering you with questions :)
So, I'd still have to save a paper, but instead of being a paper with private keys, its a paper with words that give me access to my private keys, right? I don't see a really big difference here...
When I transfer my funds to a hardware wallet, does it use the existing public keys? or does it generate new ones making me transfer funds to the new address?
If I loose my wallet, does the person who finds it gets everything in it?
If it breaks, do I need a new wallet to recover my funds? Or can I go back to a paper wallet seamlessly?
On one hand, it seems like a good idea, but on the other it seems redundant to get one, What am I missing? Again, sorry for all the questions, but I an truly interested in it!

TY for this! Yes I meant BCH.
So I made a paper wallet 2 years ago where I store all my BTC. Should I change my address?

Make sure you keep a copy of the public/private keys, as most probably your nieces will loose them...

KK, you peaked my interest, I'll look it up, and most probably will get one if I see a clear advantage! TYVM my friend!

Just don't tell me what is going to happen...
I like to be surprised ! :)

For people who have it:
* 1 Does it charge via USB only?
* 2 Does it work on all of your coins?
* 3 What if you loose it, or it breaks?
* 4 Type anything you would improve on it if you could
* 5 (any additional comment?)

Tks for making it clear! Now I understand it better!
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:23:27
Tks man! That gave me a better view on the mechanics of things!

Hello! I don't actually know if you are serious or not, but I'll reply because it's something I also want to clear out myself...
As far as I know, you don't have to wait those 4 minutes in the shop. As soon as the transaction is in the blockchain (which is pretty much instantly) you can leave. Only 4 minutes later -in this scenario- the tx was done and the person had their funds.
If I'm wrong please elaborate a little bit more, I feel I need to understand this completely!

What are the chances there is going to be a split?
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:43:40
This with AUD$3838 would be something :D
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:07:45
You got a similar prediction for any other coins? :)
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:59:35
I'm sorry my friend, allow me to ask a little bit more. I also have my bitcoin in Bitstamp.
* Where can I create a paper wallet? the most recommended site?
* Why would I need to take them out to that wallet in the first place? What's the risk in leaving them there?
I'm sorry for these newbie questions but I am really a casual person at this... I just bought a few a while back and left them 'cooking'.
