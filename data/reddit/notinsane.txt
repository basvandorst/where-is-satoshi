The last big bubble was a massive fraud perpetrated by Mark Karpeles.
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:10:19
2+% fees?
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:35:21


You're willing to give a company that was bankrupt but refused to admit it a little slack? A company that claimed their withdrawals would be delayed by just two weeks that turned into six months? A company that has refused to process withdrawals for months despite the recent bubble making them very rich? A company whose insolvency majorly contributed to the last bubble?
You Bitcoin cultists are truly sick. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:10:58
The whole thing was a scam. Bitcoin is scams all the way down.
@_date: 2014-08-25 02:58:52
I am shocked that not one of you pussies who lost life-changing money in this fiasco has offed this evil motherfucker yet. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:41:27


Fact: Karpeles himself said on irc that the March-April 2013 bubble brought in over $8 million in fees and this is verifiable by looking at the charts.
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:40:55
They were bankrupt until the latest bubble. Now, they're too rich to give a fuck and they know that if they start processing withdrawals, the price will tank. 
They should be prosecuted by the Japanese government. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:40:02
People are touting this as something big, but in reality, it's pathetic. A $10 billion market cap and the biggest site to accept it does a measly $1 million after a month?
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:13:51
Mark Karpeles should be brought to justice. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:40:09
Trust him, goy.
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:11:12
Yeah, I'm sure it  has nothing to do with Mtgox not processing withdrawals, generating increased buying pressure.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:54:36
This a subreddit that even in November used Mtgox as the official price and dissenters are and were routinely downvoted.

Mark Karpeles shouldn't be in prison, he should be dead. He engineered the last bubble and also stole those Bitcoins. Why has no one who lost thousands or millions killed this evil mothetfucker yet?

@_date: 2014-03-25 22:05:58
I generally buy and sell the same amount of Bitcoin at two different exchanges. If I put $10,000 in one exchange, I take $10,000 out of the other exchange and whatever profit I have made goes back into Bitcoin. I have mostly done this so I can say that I have nothing invested in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-19 14:16:46
Yeah let's all sing the praises of a government that turned a blind eye to a massive fraud and lets Mark Karpeles walk free. That conniving Jew should be in solitary confinement for life.

Mtgox has generated over 250,000 Bitcoins from trading fees over the years. $5 million is nothing. There is no excuse for why they haven't paid fiat to people after the latest bubble.

It has still gone up too quick. There is absolutely no reason why after the Silk Road got shut down for the price to be double what it was in less than a month. It is absolutely ludicrous.

It's been now over 12 hours since I deposited my money and my transfer hasn't even been accepted. This is simply unacceptable for any business as far as I'm concerned.

You'd be surprised. Wordpress, a pretty big site, has done less than 100 bitcoin transactions since March, and they were a big part of the reason for the March April bubble. Reddit says that Bitcoin is about 1% of their sales. 
Truth is, people are more interested in signing up new merchants in order to make their hoard more valuable, but they mostly don't want to spend it. Why would you spend Bitcoin if you believe it will be worth $10,000 in the future?
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:03:34
Let's say the third batch of Avalons is another 600 units. All three batches running 100% would add 99.000 thash/s to the current 46 thash/s which is already factoring in some Avalons. So at most, that's 14.5 thash/s unless Butterfly Labs starts shipping which is unlikely. 
Where are you getting 750 thash/s?

Cavirtex is owned by a greedy kike, but is necessary to use for high rollers. 
Libertybit's 0.5% fee is nice, but the volume is low, and it seems like people just aren't putting a lot of money into their accounts. Worse, it takes until late in the evening for your early morning transfers to be processed. That is honestly outrageous.
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:34:06
Because there is absolutely no logic behind this bubble. None. The price should have tanked to $60 after the Silk Road got shut down. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:10:00
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:22:07
It's been now over 12 hours since I deposited my money and my transfer hasn't even been accepted. This is simply unacceptable for any business as far as I'm concerned. Because of a lack of sellers, the price is now $150. Because LibertyBit is unresponsive, I could not buy at $125. I would not use LibertyBit again, definitely.

Just because Cavirtex has a price of $90 doesn't mean you can buy anything at that price. The cheapest coin you can buy as I write is $94.99, plus the usurious fees charged by the owner Joseph Davidberg.

I'm getting tired of this shit. What are people thinking? The price crashes to $175 on Mtgox and this is apparently a signal to some that it's time to buy? Why the hell has the price rebounded back to 203 in less than a hour? There is no logical explanation for this nonsense. The price was supposed to crash! 
I sold at about $180 on Bitstamp, watched as the price went down to a low of $156. Now I wake up an hour later (set my alarm to monitor to price all night) and have to buy back in at over $180 for no fucking reason? I lost coins thanks to this completely ludicrous buying behavior. I am disgusted with these creeps who have rebounded the price when a crash is what is needed.

@_date: 2013-04-13 20:37:31
It doesn't matter if you trade there or not. Mtgox is the market leader and all the exchanges follow their price. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:05:36
Bitstamp is usually 5% lower than mtgox. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 03:06:31
I sold all of my other coins at an average of $165 the day after the crash, enough to pay off every cent I've put into Bitcoin, so this Avalon machine is free for me, but I could have sold the coins I bought the Avalon for and bought many, many more coins when the price went down to $50. 
Avalon is garbage, but I wasn't expecting BFL to ship before even Batch 3 came out. My worst case scenario was the difficult would be 20,000,000 when my Batch 3 arrived. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 05:05:44
No, some of those orders never went to completion, if you're talking about Avalon.

 When almost every single major exchange can be manipulated by Ddosing (have they ever heard of Amazon EC2?), microtransactions, and pure volume, Bitcoin is just not ready yet.
