I found this hard to believe, but [apparently]( the Tor project was previously funded by DARPA, the NSF, and the Naval Research library.

I think I may have gotten it, what do I do now?
@_date: 2013-05-07 19:02:59
Still pretty new to bitcoin, what would I do with the private key if i find it? How would I use that to claim the coins that are in the wallet?
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:13:13
Why are you doing this? You're kind of ruining it.
@_date: 2013-05-11 05:20:02
Son of a bitch...
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:38:54
I can't figure out how to transfer the rest of the funds, care to help? I've got the two halves of the key but brainwallet keeps saying source address doesn't match private key.

For  I thought it was referring to boron, until Fab1anFab1an cleared it up... that was really confusing. The only "new" thing I could find about boron was boron nitride nanotubes and I tried many permutations of that.

Is there any significance to the random capitalization in the decrypted cryptobins?
@_date: 2013-05-07 20:03:44
Pretty sure I got the constellation... now I'm stuck.
@_date: 2013-05-12 20:51:25
As was I. I would so appreciate another hint for the 3rd bin.
@_date: 2013-05-25 23:42:18
Trying to buy a hint, and bitcoin-qt is reporting that the transaction is over the size limit, and that I'll need to pay a fee of 0.006 BTC. Is that normal?
@_date: 2013-05-07 20:54:00
Please let us know what the solution was... I'm banging my head against the desk trying to figure out the last cryptobin
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:40:04
WHAT DO THE NUMBERS MEAN
@_date: 2013-05-11 05:12:15
Congrats dude. Do share. I need to know what was "behind the door so I could go home".
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:04:18
So the "I" in the 5th bin refers to the word used to decrypt the 4th bin?
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:11:55
Do the hints correspond to the clues in any way? hint 1 to clue 1, 2 to 2, etc.
@_date: 2013-05-07 21:25:12
After you solve the first cryptobin, it gives you a hint that points to the first bitcoin block that was mined and a link to the second cryptobin. One of the clues was "nonce" so you look up the nonce from the first bitcoin block hash and that decrypts the second cryptobin. The second cryptobin gives you the first half of the private key and "6051p161", which you put after cryptobin.org/, then apparently "Leo &amp; Victoria" decrypted that last cryptobin and gives you, I assume, the second half of the private key.
Edit - just saw that smeggletoot posted the solution [below](

How the hell am I supposed to know what's behind the door... so vague
@_date: 2013-05-11 03:44:10
I've got nothing on that. Time for another hint methinks.
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:39:16
the passwords are Case sensitive ;)
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:46:27
Switched to Chrome from Firefox, got it. Thanks Fab1anFab1an! This was a really good one. I can finally go outside for a bit now.
@_date: 2013-05-11 01:49:52
I've padded all the sharp edges in my apartment in preparation for the inevitable frustration that comes with these riddles.
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:02:04
You've gotta think outside the box for that one.
@_date: 2013-05-11 04:32:13
You get the name yet?
@_date: 2013-05-07 21:31:30
Saw that, thanks. Great job with that. I got up to the last part but couldn't figure out the constellation.
@_date: 2013-07-09 20:35:56
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:19:03
bitcoin-qt wants me to pay a 0.004 transaction fee to transfer to the hint address?
@_date: 2013-05-25 23:11:00
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:15:42
What does that have to do with "You can count the treasures on 1 hand"?
@_date: 2013-05-25 23:46:25
Yeah, mostly from faucets. Anything I can do about that?
@_date: 2013-05-07 20:53:06
Good one.
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:01:28
Wait what?
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:26:25
Uhhh I feel like an idiot...
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:21:21
Yes I did
