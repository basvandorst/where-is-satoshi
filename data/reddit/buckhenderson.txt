I forget where I read it, but someone was saying that Microsoft and apple has two different strategies; apple gave computers to young kids, so by the time they were adults, apple would be the only thing they've used. Microsoft gave computers to kids about to enter the workforce, so people would want their workforce to know Microsoft.

i think the difference is it's libel is if it's in print form (i.e. the newsweek article), compared to slander if it's spoken (e.g. an interview, which i think she did also, so probably both). they're both defamation, and i think the distinction is kind of pointless, regarding how media works these days. like i said, i was just being pedantic.

To be pedantic, I think the charge would be libel, wouldn't it?

how does the math work exactly? i hear things said like "to mine bitcoins, your computer does some math and solves complex problems, and then bitcoins or a 'block' of bitcoins appears." can anyone explain this? what math are they doing? where does it come from? is there a record of this math? when a coin is cloned from bitcoin, like i hear dogecoin is, can you just use that record from bitcoin to skip ahead and go straight to the coins? (i'm almost certain the answer to the last one is no, otherwise, someone would have all the dogecoins, but that just illustrates that i don't understand where they come from in the first place)
