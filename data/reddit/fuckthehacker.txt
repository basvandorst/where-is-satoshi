This is my opinion as well. The recent rise of the BTC price is just a bubble, created by chinese mining whales who want to sell high all and then dump BTC for good, since they have BCH now. They are free now from the limitation of the core team and can adjust the difficulty to make much bigger profits. Reading between the lines in Roger Ver's and Jihan Wu's tweets, they will trade most of their BTC for BCH and will continue to drive up BCH's price. The coming no-replay fork will expose all BTC wallets and cause the biggest crash in price. Probably like the tulip disaster, or more recent Zcash going to 3K BTC and then back to 0.02. The traders buying BTC at 4K and above are just ignorant of what is going to happen soon for their destruction.

SEC is the government regulator, there is no other way to regulate securities. So far 2 commssioners are for ETF. The next commissioner (appointed in December) will probably be also in favour of ETF. We have to wait and see. Also, bakkt will offer actual buying and holding of Bitcoins with insurance. The ETF is imminent. The question is will it affect the market dramatically? If it coincides with a bull market it definitely will help to break the last ATH.

I agree that HF without replay protection is not good. The reasons are political - if 2x has replay protection this would mean that they are not the 'true' bitcoin. The same goes for core's side. Furthermore, let us recall what was the reaction of the big western exchanges when Roger Ver threatened to HF his BU project without replay protection. The exchanges refused to list the new coin until the replay protection is build. Since Ver was stubborn the whole project fell apart. In the meantime the uncertainty lead to a mass panic selling dropping the price nearly 40%. It recovered only when it was clear that the HF will not happen. Now the situation is the same although 2x has 90%-ish support. If most of the nodes refuse to communicate with the miners, and core team takes legal actions as they decided to do, then what? If for a day with news like ICO's ban make such damage to the price (and the news were actually good for bitcoin), what will happen if the situation is not settled for weeks or months?

You mean you can't read the embedded russian tweets, or don't believe it? Btw, the same info appears now on btc-e.com.
