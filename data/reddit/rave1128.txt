I agree with your point that a collage degree is on the brink of being pointless.  People are coming out with more debt thant they can afford, to a world with less jobs and less pay. Things are moving so fast, the degree they just learnt is out of date.  But most college educated people do better on average than non-college educated.
For every 1 millionaire there will be 1000s who tried and failed.  What i am saying is that most success is being in the right place at the right time i.e. becoming aware of the FIRE programme and taking advantage if it (please link, I'm from the UK so not heard of this, but seems very intresting).

Appoligies in advance for this long one; but it does piss me off when people have a go a millennials.
Gen X; the last of the privileged.  Hit the property boom perfectly, had cheap education and the last of the decently paying jobs, where you could put surplus income into a highly volatile investment such as bitcoin on a 'shit or bust' campaign, which against all odds actually paid off.
My sister is 40 and paid 25k for her house which is now worth 200k ffs.  Buy the time   a millennial could be approved for a mortgage, if they were fortunate enough to be able to afford one (i was) the market had collapsed and the banks stopped lending.
Most 18-35 year olds dont have a pot to piss in, can only dream of owning a property, especially in an area where there are half decent jobs to pay for said property, and will probably be living with their parents until they inherit when their parents are dead.
If your retirement was due to investing some surplus savingings into bitcoin in 2013, I would say that 99% of your retirement was down to shear luck and 1% you taking the decision to make a punt.  You did the equvalent of buying a lottery ticket.
That doesn't make you Warren Buffett.
