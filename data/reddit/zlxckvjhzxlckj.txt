As far as I'm concerned, downvoted because anyone with experience of the way PayPal acts will tell you that they side with the payer and reverse the payment, even when that results in the seller getting ripped off.

It sounds like you're an atheist and moral relativist who believes that there are no moral absolutes.  But the existence of moral absolutes is something we all know about even if we don't admit it.  
It is not possible to live consistently to the notion that there are no moral absolutes.  The interesting thing about people who are moral relativists is that the moment somebody wrongs them in some way, they immediately forget about their rejection of moral absolutes, and insist that the other person has done them wrong.  That ought to give them a clue that the moral law is not man made.

Nobody knows the future, but actually it's not so delusional to believe that a single bitcoin could indeed rise to $500k or more. 
Do some research on how &amp; why Bitcoin could become a major player that disrupts the Forex market and remittances (just for starters). 
Then consider how Bitcoin provides a store of value that is safe in the face of government 'austerity measures' and bail-ins of failing economies in the face of hyper-inflation.  
Add to that the advantages for merchants in accepting Bitcoin rather than card payments in lower fees and zero chargeback risk.
Then consider that the supply of bitcoins is fixed and cannot be hyper-inflated.  With a deflationary currency used for card payments, forex, and safe haven store of value, the value of a single bitcoin would have to rise very, very considerably.

Yes, there is confirmation bias here.  I came here wanting to believe it was so, and reading the comments only confirms this for me ;)

There are strict rules in the UK covering the responsibilities of businesses that collect personal data.  It falls under the Data Protection Act.  The authority that investigates breaches of the DPA is the Information Commissioners Office -

If you take the long view, it doesn't matter to Bitcoin whether all those coins get sold or whether they never move.
Sure, if they got all dumped on the market now, the price would crash.  For now.
But Bitcoin's potential to take a serious slice of:
* the forex market
* current credit/debit card payments
* current remittances
would exist just the same.
Bitcoin would also still provide a safe haven for savings against hyper-inflation of failing fiat currencies, and protection against enforced government bail-outs of failing economies.
The potential future BTC/fiat rate if Bitcoin goes mainstream is based on a calculation of what all those above markets are worth, divided by the maximum number of bitcoins that will ever exist. 
The number of bitcoins that can ever exist is capped at just under 21 million.
Satoshi's unmoved coins are part of that 21 million.  So they are already factored into the equation in trying to predict what a bitcoin could be worth if Bitcoin goes mainstream.
So if Satoshi's coins were all traded now, the price crash would be temporary.  It would be a great buying opportunity :)

Not at all.  The comment I replied to asserted that ownership is a legal or moral value that has nothing to do with Bitcoin.  I am asserting that, on the contrary, the whole point of having the blockchain is that it is the ledger that verifies who *owns* which coins.  Ownership of coins is central to how Bitcoin works.
I think this point will become even clearer in the future when the Bitcoin system with its blockchain is applied to ownership of other assets such as stock, shares, land/real property etc.  
The blockchain is all about asset ownership, so to say that ownership is a moral/legal value and nothing to do with Bitcoin is not correct.

Paper wallets are in use now because securing your bitcoins from theft by hackers and malware is not easy to safely do, especially on a Windows box.  
Another risk at present is that of accidentally locking yourself out of your bitcoins forever if you secure them but bodge the way you do it so you can't get back in.
I agree that we need a really easy to use and foolproof way to receive/spend/hold bitcoins if Bitcoin is going to go mainstream. It needs to be 'granny-friendly'.
But I don't think trusting your bitcoins to centralised services is a very good idea.  Centralised services that 'move' bitcoins from one member's account to another, but with it all happening off-chain (so the block chain does not record the transaction) are risky.  Trust your coins to a third party and you could lose them. We don't need another MTGOX scandal.  The bitcoins are not safely yours unless the block chain says so.
What we need are really cheap, widely available, easy to use, and foolproof/secure hardware wallet devices.  I think they will come, eventually.  The Trezor is a good move in that direction.

I couldn't disagree with you more strongly.  
Different jurisdictions define ownership differently, and allow the separation out of aspects of ownership differently.
But broadly, if you own something, and it's not an arrangement where you are only the legal owner or trustee  holding on trust for the beneficial owner(s), then you enjoy the exclusive right to the use and enjoyment of the thing owned: to trade or spend it, to destroy it, to give it away, or do what you want with it.  In other words, you enjoy the right to control it.


This implies that if you were to stumble upon someone else's private keys to their bitcoin addresses, it's their tough luck, you would be entitled to spend those coins and tell yourself that you did nothing wrong, because 'legal or moral positions' have 'nothing to do with Bitcoin'.
Whilst if you managed to get someone else's private keys without their knowledge or permission you could, de facto, spend their coins, you most certainly would not have the de jure right to do so.  It would be theft.
Only the owner of bitcoins has legitimate control of those bitcoins. 
The brilliance of Bitcoin lies in how it uses cryptography and incentivized mining to create and protect the blockchain, which is a **decentralized public ledger that verifies ownership**.  That is at the heart of what Bitcoin is about.
@_date: 2014-09-20 01:24:53




You don't understand what the blockchain is.  
It is a distributed public ledger that verifies **ownership**
Satoshi himself contradicts you, below is an excerpt from the bitcoin.pdf white paper.  In his own words:

Re 2) - if this happened, the crash would be only temporary.  Attempts to calculate the possible value of one bitcoin should it go mainstream in a big way take into account that there will only ever be under 21 million coins in existence.  Sataoshi's unmoved coins are part of that 21 million, so are already factored into the equation in working out what one BTC might be worth one day.

If BTC crashed to $20 per bitcoin, there would be a massive amount of buying up of bitcoins by those speculators who understand Bitcoin's disruptive potential and it's likely price in the future when it goes mainstream (given the total number of coins is capped at 21 million). 
The only thing that would make bitcoin go to zero is if a fatal flaw was found in the code.  That would kill it.  Otherwise, price drops are merely an opportunity for there to be a re-distribution of coins, and the wise would buy them up while cheap.  I certainly would.
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:24:10
You're not seeing the bigger picture.  Why did Satoshi create a system that enables control of coins in the first place?  So that they could be owned, and so that ownership could be transferred from one person to another with reduced risk of double spending.  
You've already contradicted Satoshi, so you will no doubt think Andreas Antonopoulos is wrong as well:
Your argument attempts to legitimize theft, on the basis that if I gain control of your private keys, tough on you, you don't own those coins anyway.
Ownership is not something we made up.  It's a moral law that 'thou shall not steal'.
