"two days before the day after tomorrow. zomg, thats today!!!"

I always check before I buy a PIN. It usually is a little cheaper than Coinbase after fees. Much cheaper than LBC but you can't buy several K at once. Not a problem for you today but maybe down the road :)

FYI, smallest denomination on LibertyX is $50. It is by far my preferred cash to bitcoin option  Just did a search on their site. Looks like they have quite a few locations in SF and Monterey. LBC is also good but for larger amounts (lot of hassle scheduling a meet up and more expensive).

I recommend libertyx to any unintiated bitcoiners. There is usually a store within a few blocks and can't beat their no fees for first 1K. I've bought quite a bit from them and their price is always Coinbase or better. They also have a phone support line which is a godsend for newbies.
@_date: 2015-05-11 23:27:20
Yeah, I'm getting some JS error error as well. Both times I've tried so far I have been unsuccessful. I'd stick to LibertyX / LBC for now.

use libertyx.com - been using them for 3 months. never any problems like this. their customer service is top notch. you guys could learn a thing or two from them!

There are a few LibertyX stores in Las Vegas

What organization? Sounds cool.
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:35:48
whoever has the lowest prices. you should lower your fees. 4-5% is too high.
@_date: 2015-07-23 23:15:35
that makes sense.

Yes. I did this earlier as they have an Ace near me. Way better than QPay IMO. I had already signed up so I just told the cashier my phone number. I handed over $100 cash and immediately received a text message confirming the payment. It gave me a link to go and enter the bitcoin address to send to.

looking forward to their US launch

Are you sure about SS? I never had to do that. Just name, address, DOB.
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:41:34
Just checked prices now: $271 for co-op deposit at bitquick vs $247 at libertyx. Why are the prices so high? Also the 3 hour wait is unsettling. I'd rather get my BTC instantly after payment (like libertyx or localbitcoins).
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:41:20
i want to do the same with bananas!
@_date: 2015-04-25 23:11:09
i went to the store near the empire state building. in and out in 2 mins. not exactly times square but a nice short walk away.
@_date: 2015-04-05 18:50:03
looks like the cash to bitcoin sector is heating up with libertyx (stores), localbitcoin (people) and now these guys (banks).
@_date: 2015-04-29 22:21:05
libertyx.com - 2,500 stores nationwide. Prob is a store near you that you can go and give cash for bitcoin instantly.
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:25:37
I'm a fan. Can't beat 1% fees. You can use whatever wallet you want and there a bunch of locations where I am most (Boston, NYC). I use it up to my weekly limit and then LBC above and beyond that. Signup was similar to Coinbase/Circle sans bank account linking since it's cash.
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:39:51
phone is probably best (quickest resolution) but email is quickest since many agents can look at the same support tickets.
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:31:13
use options that don't require additional hardware like localbitcoins or libertyx. i've used both and there are tons of sellers/stores for both in nyc.
@_date: 2015-04-03 21:47:41
second this. there was a store 3 blocks away and i had bitcoin in my wallet in &lt;15 mins.
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:20:07
I haven't actually completed a Bitquick transaction. When I entered my order the Bitquick price was 5% above Finex so I went with LibertyX. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 23:03:40
main benefit is # of locations. they have 3k locations nationwide. here in boston there are prob 10 within a few miles of me. 
fwiw my limit is $1k/day and $3k/week and it has been since i signed up. i've asked a few times if i could bump that up and they said they hope to have an additional volume level soon.
@_date: 2015-04-03 21:51:47
i've seen waiters use bitpay on their mobile phones. it seems like they don't have to go back and print a receipt? if it saves time (walking back and forth) that could be a big selling point.
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:19:10
very cool

UK may be the most regulatory friendly bitcoin country as of yet...
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:37:56
if you need to use cash i would recommend libertyx (stores instead of ATMs). i've only used it in boston/nyc but it should work the same. if you don't need cash, circle/coinbase are probably easier and you don't need to leave your home. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:20:07
deposit of 1 BTC? double your purchasing power!
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:45:44
i read the manhattan PYC was doing something crazy like 200K a month?
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:30:50
i've given in to the fact that for any reputable company to buy bitcoin i'm going to have to provide some ID. i like the fact that i don't need to meet a stranger (LBC) and as a result the prices are low. also getting a timely response from libertyx (i've tried both email/phone support) is encouraging. i've still to get responses from coinbase/circle weeks later.
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:08:33
wow. did they explain what happened?
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:58:35
i initially had this issue as well. i contacted support and they said to try an older address (and it worked). they also said if that didn't work, i could upload my id similar to
