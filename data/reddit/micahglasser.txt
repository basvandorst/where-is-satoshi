Yes. I think I have the best of both works. I keep some money in my Coinbase account for easy spending. I trust it about as much as I trust keeping money in my back pocket. Reliable, but I wouldn't want my life savings there. The rest of my BTC I keep in the multisig vault. I consider that to be top notch security. And yes I have my keys so I do own the BTC. No entity can keep me from my vault BTC precisely because I alone hold the keys.

Bitcoins are already being lent out on exchanges for people who want to take leveraged positions going long. Anyone can go to one of these sites and lend out some bitcoin for interest.

Unfortunate what I linked to is really dense. Carson had another paper that's a more condensed version of this book called "The Iron Fist Behind the Invisible Hand". Just Google it. He also has another book that is free online which is really long but also pretty readable that is really relevant to Bitcoin and creating a kind of subversive economy called " The Home Brew Industrial Revolution" Any ways Kevin Carson is just all around awesome so just read something from him. Everything he writes will change your perspective.

I'm sorry you don't know the difference between personal property and capital. Its kind of silly for you to be arguing about theories you obviously don't know anything about.

Your error is in thinking that a free market is compatible with capitalism. Capitalism requires the accumulation of capital which both arises from, and begets, a collusion between industry and the state.

Some people earn condescension. Nothing is more intellectually painful to me than watching the ignorant strut about making way too much noise about their certainty. If you want to learn more about libertarianism and its roots in mutalism I highly suggest reading Kevin Carson's [Mutualist Political Economy].( It will blow your mind if you can make it through it. And I promise you it will cast the power of bitcoin into a whole new light if you're bright enough to connect the dots.

Austerity exists because banking cartels control the money supply and the ultra rich bond holders want paid. Such a predicament could not obtain in an economy based on bitcoin. See mutalism for more details.

Socialism is defined by workers owning and or controlling the means of production. It has nothing inherently to do with governments or loose central bank fiscal policy. It gets so tiresome hearing this old troupe dragged out over and over that bitcoin and or libertarianism is somehow anti-socialist. Many socialists are libertarian and free market such as mutualists.

@_date: 2014-10-08 15:39:12
The only central tenet of socialism is that the workers either own or have direct democratic control over the means of production. Every other silly thing you may associate with socialism such as currency controls, authoritarian governments with gulags, etc. are merely failed strategies, by mostly failed states, in an effort to achieve that goal. Socialism itself has nothing to do with centralization, statism, or authoritarianism. The failure of socialism to materialize in reality is similar to the failure of true democracy or true free markets. Almost all nations play lip service to democracy and freedom, or free trade, etc. But you probably already know that's mostly bullshit. The truth is the powerful use states and finance to acquire and solidify more and more power.  Bitcoin and decentralized markets will return power to the people. There are a lot of libertarian socialists down with that such as myself.

Consumer demand certainly is a problem when wages stagnate. It is now, and it was in the late 1970's too. Without sufficient consumer demand lending institutions will not lend no matter how cheap the money. So the point remains. It makes a lot of economic sense to get the ball rolling from the demand side rather the the supply side.

Libertarian Socialism is an ideology not a form of government per se. Libertarian Socialists (AKA anarchists) seek to decentralize power structures, oppose illegitimate power, and seek the creation of communities based on free association. Libertarian socialists do not want to force anything on anyone. One belief held by many is that monetary monopolies by states and state banks create an artificial economic situation which promotes wage labor and corporatism over other more equitable forms production and business. (this is a simplification but you can read more about it if you Google Mutalism) My point in replying to you at all is just a hope that you will consider the issues about which you speak are perhaps more complex than you realize.

Funny, how do you think capitalism started? It started with the accumulation of capital, i.e. a bunch of land and resources were appropriated from the people who owned them at the point of a sword. The modern world was built  on the back of slavery, empire, and genocide.
Look around you. Is it a coincidence that the richest countries have the biggest militaries? Capitalists take what they from who they want. That is the lesson of history. 
So when you look around at the world and see incredible inequality let's not say it's its some how fair and just. And that creating a more equal world means theft. That is some new speak right there.

I am in total agreement. Have you ever read Kevin Carson Per chance? He is a neo-mutualist "free market socialist". Reading him led me down the path from right-wing libertarian to leftwing anarchism.

But you can hold your own private keys with a coinbase multisig vault account.
@_date: 2014-11-15 19:52:29
Well I do. The Coinbase  multisig vault is more difficult to set up then a paper wallet. Do you even know anything about it? It has some significant advantages over just about anything out there. 
If you are using a paper wallet then it probably is BIP38 protected. You also probably have one stored at more than one location (if your not a dumb ass). Now you also have to write down that BIP38 password (which should be about as long as Bitcoin key anyways) or risk forgetting it. Now you have just introduced a security threat. You have a paper wallet physically hidden in multiple places that rely on a pass phrase that could also easily be lost or forgotten. And the more places you hide a password the less security you have. Additionally the system is very inconvenient. Every time you want to move any funds out of your paper wallet you now have to make a new one with a new password. Find a second location (trusted third party?) To store your wallet, etc. Also if someone does find your paper wallet and the BIP 38 password and attempts to spend the funds you will get no other warnings. Your Bitcoin will just be gone.
Now with my multisig wallet the process is more secure and more convenient. I generate a deterministic, multisig, wallet. There are now two keys required to spend. I hold one and Coinbase holds there other. A third key is encrypted and determined from a seed that only I hold. Both I and Coinbase holds this key but only I have the seed.
So Coinbase cannot withhold or spend my money. They do not hold my keys. They just hold a piece of one of my keys. If want to spend with Coinbase (which is a huge convenience and advantage) I just need my seed. If Coinbase becomes compromised or goes bankrupt, or whatever, I simply use an opensource algorithm on Github to decrypt my seed, then combine that with my key. Then I'm ready to spend. Where Coinbase had no such option. They don't have the seed. They don't have my Bitcoin. So I get all the convenience of Coinbase (48 hour warning, 2 factor, ability to transfer my bought Bitcoin directly to my multisig vault, etc.
This system may not be for everyone. And I'm not saying it is the most secure way to store Bitcoin. But I am saying it's one of the best and most secure ways. 
So please hold back the insults. If you don't like or trust Coinbase that's fine. I've been using then for three years and never had a problem.
Tldr. Coinbase multisig rocks

"Libertarian socialism (sometimes called social anarchism,[1][2] left-libertarianism[3][4] and socialist libertarianism[5]) is a group of political philosophies within the socialist movement that reject the view of socialism as state ownership or command of the means of production[6] within a more general criticism of the state form itself[7][8] as well as of wage labour relationships within the workplace.[9] Instead it emphasizes workers' self management of the workplace[10] and decentralized structures of political government[11] asserting that a society based on freedom and equality can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite.[12] Libertarian socialists generally place their hopes in decentralized means of direct democracy and federal or confederal associations[13] such as libertarian municipalism, citizens' assemblies, trade unions, and workers' councils.[14][15] All of this is generally done within a general call for libertarian[16] and voluntary human relationships[17] through the identification, criticism, and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority in all aspects of life.[18][19][20][21][22][23][24]"

I had most of my coins on multiple bip38 paper wallets. I wanted to try out multsig and I already used Coinbase to buy coins so I decided to give their multisig vault a try. I really like it. Technically its not true cold storage because your keys are generated while your computer is still online. But you do have control of your own keys and a lot of other nice security and convenience perks you can't get any other way. In the future I may switch to another multisig wallet, or a combination of Trezor and some sort of future multisig/trezor combination system. But for now I'm very happy with my set up and the security it offers. I do agree, however, that if you aren't holding your own keys you are taking a risk. But for beginners and those who just want smallish amounts of Bitcoin that they can spend easily its hard to beat the ease and convenience of a Coinbase wallet.

Same here. While I would like to see Bitcoin move into a bullish trend I am glad to build up my coin stash. I started October 2013 with an initial larger buy-in at around 250$ and have been buying between 50-100$ worth every 2 weeks since. I never dreamed I would be able to own so many coin. So best case scenario for me is that Bitcoin starts to very slowly go into an up trend and allows me to dollar cost average over a year back up to

1.  All I have is fiat USD and I want some BTC. I then find an exchange "gateway" of which there will be many. I then somehow purchase gatewayUSD. (here I am already confused. How will I purchase GatewayUSD? Once I purchase GatewayUSD isn't my money just as at risk as it ever was buying BitstampUSD? Why isn't the gateway just as accountable to strict KYC laws as any other exchange?)

Well if there was an easy way to know we would all be rich. As a rule of thumb however  if a long pintail forms on a red candle stick and is then flowed by a green candle stick with a body that is greater than the preceding red candle stick on the daily chart that it's a good buy signal. (Google price action technical analysis) This pattern is forming right now if you look on Bitcoinwisdom. But to reiterate, there really is no way of knowing. Just patterns that might give a clue.

When an asset decreases in value it is called deflation. Since most new bitcoin are immediately sold on the market when they are created it has a deflationary effect on the currency.

Socialism is a very general label of which communists and libertarians are a subset. Socialism is defined by worker control of the means of production.

If you have to ask this question you should probably just leave your coins in Coinbase vault. It's quite easy to screw up if you don't know what you're doing. Or just move a small amount to a wallet like Mycelium and play with it and get familiar with everything before moving a larger amount.

It's been a while since I set mine up. I know what you mean, I was a bit confused about that too, but no you don't need multiple accounts. That's an option for like business partners or for extra security. You just want to set up the most simple multi sig account. You have 1 key, Coinbase has another key, and then a third key is encrypted. Coinbase can't access your coins without the pass phrase for the encrypted key, or your key. Only you have the pass phrase so your coins are secure.

I think its funny you think socialism has to be statist.....and capitalism doesn't? There are lots of examples of present and past non-statist yet socialist entities. Just look the PKK or the Zapatistas. 
also have you noticed how statist actually existing capitalism is? That's because capitalism needs the state to operate. without violent coercion to protect rents on all manner of property and without a military to open markets capitalism would become mutualism.

Do you know what communism is? It is a classless, stateless, society where all productivity is for direct use instead of commodity use, and there is no money. In other words it is a utopia. It is something to strive for not fear. Clearly if such state of affairs were achievable at all it would not happen without a lot of advanced technology. If or when communism is achieved it will probably happen in a small city-state/commune first.

This is not an unconventional understanding in Marxist theory. The point is, yes capital is the means of production, but it is always owned by the capitalists in a capitalist system. (By definition capitalists are a class of people who exploit and do no work) Which is why I further described it as it actually exists instead of just in the abstract. I did this for you so you would understand what I'm trying to say.

"This isn't real capitalism, if e just could make it more pure all our problems would away". For that matter I hear Christians say this too when challenge them about it's history of violence. That said I'm not a communist except in a kind of philosophical/science fiction.... One day we might be able to achieve this... Kinds of way. In the mean time I very much believe in using real free markets to bring more equity to the world. Even Marx thought that Capitalism would ultimately lead first to socialism and then finally to communism. 


 I think the world order as it stands is basically fascist, and its failing miserably. Also if you took the two paradigmatic examples of fascist vs. Socialist (I think the USSR was pretty fascist too but hey), Nazi Germany vs. USSR, I would say the USSR was hands down the more successful state. Their war machine smashed the Nazis, they put the first man in space. For a while they were the most scientifically advanced nation on the planet. At the the time of the revolution they were basically a feudal farming back water, yet they became a power house.  The state lasted 85 years. 
Now look at Nazi Germany. Well, besides starting the most destructive war in history, committing the worst form of organized murder ever, and destroying great art and scientists, they finally imploded and completely destroyed what had been there most developed and cultured nation on earth in about 7 years... Bravo. But hey, they did build the autobahn.


As long as you don't initiate violence against me for using property that you don't directly possess and use I'm down with that.

 I think maybe you have seen the word in all caps like that because the car company FIAT is an acronym. But the word 'fiat' would not be capitalized. Also no need for emphasis on the word. I just now figured that out by Googling it. So I'm not making fun of you or anything, but it does seem that is the reason I keep seeing people writing it like that... Kind of funny though.

Like a community of egoists type idea? I think at times people can enter into a relationship where they accept the outcome of a vote. If they really hate the results they can leave their community/relationship. Of course for this to work we need confederated communities instead of nation states. Anyways just calling something anarchy is not very helpful. If you spent much time studying it you would find that no one seems to agree on much concerning what it is. But at least some people use it as a synonym for direct democracy.

Not sure what relevance that has to my comment.... But sure. Have you read Hegels "Philosophy of Right"? That book lays out the foundational concepts of " the state". Personally I believe the age of the nation state is almost over. 
I foresee government switching over to mutually enforceable contracts over the block chain and economic activity taking place more and more over Internet and block chain mediated markets with collaborations taking place globally for design while production happens at a local level with fab-lab type facilities. Perhaps large cooperative conglomerates ( like Mondragon) will fill in the gaps.
This will take place over time with the withering of the state and tyrannical banking institutions that are managed by our present ruling elite.
The downfall of the present system will be full automation. As jobs become automated unemployment will rise. Political unrest will ensue. Many will turn to black and grey market activities, producing needed goods at home. Bitcoin or something similar will spread like wild fire. The State loses it's ability to tax effectively. State and Capital collapse. The new mutualist international order ushers in unprecedented prosperity.
Just one possible way it could go down. 
Sorry I was bored. Your comment was just vague enough to get me rambling on.

You assume the scarcity of resources.
@_date: 2015-07-27 17:44:57
Fiat just means to declare, usually in an official  capacity. So fiat currency is currency that has value because an official body has declared it does (by fiat). That usually means a government has declared it as legal tender and it means the government will except it for payment of taxes. It also usually means that no other currency in that realm is legal tender. So for instance Bitcoin us not legal tender in the USA. So when you spend it the government allows that, but only because they consider it a barter trade.
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:13:36
I agree with most of what you said here except the part about capitalism being co-opted. Capitalism was never about free markets, but rather had been about regulatory captured and monopoly from the beginning. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 20:09:42
I guess my main thought here is just that states are traditionally territories who's borders are defined by a political monopoly. 
But the borders of states are becoming blurry. Even the concept of law is becoming more blurry. More and more the geopolitical situation seems to be characterized by a global machine of plunder. The machine is not characterized by a political monopoly per se. Many states participate in reinforcing the plunder going on with an interweaving web of surveillance, oppressive property laws, control of money, militarizing police etc. 
I see this situation as transcending what some call "statism" because the real power being wielded is transnational and often apolitical. It is more a class of people than anything else. It is the global elite. It is the small subset of people who have gained control over almost all the capitol on planet earth. This power can use states or destroy states as they see fit.
So from my perspective the real struggle here in not against the concept of the state.   Or any particular state. At least not per se. But rather it is against the international ruling elite and against the system of global capitalism that they are creating. 
I think we should also distinguish between a police state. Which is what is now omni present, and the possible formation of states not based on coercion and subjugation. Perhaps a kind of libertarian municipality like Murray Bookchin talked about.
At any rate i believe something like crypto anarchy and tools like the block chain will provide the means that make coercive states obsolete. I'm kind of a techno optimist. If think if we manage to not destroy ourselves in the next decades that we will transcend scarcity and start a new chapter in human history.

OK, but again that says nothing about how the society is actually organized. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 15:58:31
You seem obsessed with the state. I believe the present global oligarchy is something that transcends "statism". It's not as if" the state " is all coercive power and everything else is just freedom. I'm more influenced by nuanced thinkers like Foucault then American style AnCaps. I saw in one of your comments that you like C4SS. Are you familiar with Kevin Carson? He is also one of my favorite theorists/thinkers.
@_date: 2015-07-02 15:22:46
This is all just speculation. And for the record in 39. 
But I think automated contracting will begin to replace government just because it can. I think it will be a slow slide away from the state as we know it. If this doesn't happen we will probably start to kill each other sooner than later. So I guess we will just have to see.

I don't want bigger government. I want better government. pretty simple idea really. Also the government already does not control the money. That responsibility as been abdicated to a private banking cartel only loosely under the auspices of the government. 
personal I support Bitcoin because it will smash both capital and the state.  
@_date: 2015-07-05 05:00:13
You have to understand that the moniker "capitalism" was originally a term used with negative connotations by first Proudhon and later Marx. So my understanding of "capital" as a concept, and its embodiment in the present system of political oppression that we live under, is informed by this historically pejorative understanding of the word. 
Now what I mean by "capital" is the accumulation and concentration of the ownership of the means of production by those who do not work. The present global order is an order where a very small number of people own almost everything. This state of affairs obtains because of certain political arrangements and property laws. I am opposed to this state of affairs and I think Bitcoin and Blockchain applications such as smart contracts will work to undermine both the life blood of capitol (which is the international banking conglomerates) and the states of the world. It will undermine the states by removing the power to effectively tax directly and tax indirectly through printing, and it will undermine the state by providing services the state provides more effectively .
If you are interested Kevin Carson is a pretty famous freemarket Anarchist with similar views. Such views have an historical origin with individualist anarchists that also described themselves as socialists such as Benjamin Tucker and Josiah Warren.
As to Bernie Sanders. I don't necessarily care for voting in our fraudulent elections at all. But I think anyone wants to turn the state away from militarism and reapply the wages of workers back to the worker's welfare is the least evil. 
Anyhow you should just be aware that there are many viewpoints that are not necessarily stupid, nor contradictory that you may have never encountered.

The medical records can't be viewed without multisig. A third party keeps one key and another encrypted key. The patient keeps another key and the password for the encrypted key. The blockchain ensures that the record can not be accessed by anyone with out authorization, yet any institution can access it if the patient gives permission. Something like that at anyways. The idea is sound even if all the details aren't there.

It's a multisig setup. You still have to back up your keys as one option. Obviously this is the only way to be in control of your Bitcoin. It's a nice setup. I've been using it for years now. I keep most of my coins in the Vault but occasionally I move some funds to my regular Coinbase wallet to spend them or transfer then to a different wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:19:24
With this setup you control your coins. If you lose your keys you lose your coins. The advantage for me is that I can buy Bitcoin with Coinbase and send them right to cold storage. The other advantage is that I can easily check my balance and send coin to my wallet from which I can spend. Once Bitcoin is out of your vault and in your wallet you no longer control the keys. Also Coinbase is insured so just a nice bonus in my opinion.

So what is your point? Android is still just a flavor of Linux. The whole point of opensource is precisely that anyone can adopt it and make it popular, or use it to their own ends. Google did this with Linux and now the whole world uses it. So yes Linux is a success and yes a large company was instrumental in that happening.
If Google decided it likes Bitcoin but wanted to release its own coin and promote it based on the opensource software and it becomes a success then great. How the success happens is not important. Only that it does happen.

I don't dispute that. I may diversify myself. But during a crypto bubble all kinds of altcoins might look good. I will wait until the dust clears before I make any decisions. Only one coin can claim honey badger status at this time.

@_date: 2015-02-03 09:20:46
Personally I like Coinbase. I keep some Bitcoin in my wallet which can be easily spent, and I keep the rest in the Coinbase multisig vault. I can transfer Bitcoin between the two fairly easily. And the Bitcoin in my vault is very secure and I alone control the keys (Coinbase has one of the multisig keys and a shared encrypted key, I have one multisig key and the pass phrase to unlock the encrypted key we both share.) Also I can transfer Bitcoin between my wallet and my bank account, and now I will soon be able to hold funds that are insured for exchange trading should I so desire. The entire combination of security and utility is unbeatable at this point (assuming you live somewhere receiving these services).
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:09:33

I'm libertarian-socialist/mutualist. I think it has great potential to undermine hierarchy simply by undermining the banking monopoly and even nationalism itself. If nation states lose the ability to tax and control currency then they lose the power to make war. At least that seems like a possibility to me.

Yes. Most people in the U.S. don't understand what socialism is but think they do. Early on it was split into state socialism and libertarian socialism. From the very beginning socialism is defined by worker control of the means of production. Everything else is just a tactic. some believe a powerful State can bring about such an end, but history has really been unkind to such a view. Others, such as myself, believe a truly free market with money free from a central bank cartel monopoly and other rent seekers will leed to the end of capitalism.

The big difference is that the housing market was/is leveraged to the hilt, as is the stick market. That kind of leverage can cause a "Minsky Moment". This is not the case with bitcoin. There is very little borrowing going on, the price of bitcoin reflects genuine savings for the most part.

No. Fiat means by decree. No authority decreed bitcoin money. Quite the contrary, most authorities seem quite adamant that it is not "real" money like the dollar. Bitcoin is money because a community of people freely decided to use it as such because of it's utility. So it is most staying not fiat.

I disagree. I think abc523 makes a valid point. While it is true that governments often make laws that society as a whole may not like - this is not the norm. I think government and its laws are most often codifications of behavioral norms. This is why gambling, homosexuality, and drug use are either illegal, or at least regulated. The state has no power unless the people are at least passively supporting it. This why revolutions do not happen until common people rise up in some sort of conflagration. The state thinks it has power over the people until one day they simply do not because the people remove that authority. Bitcoin is the kind of of technology that (in conjunction with other factors) could destroy the entire nation-state/neo-liberal/capitalist world order. I think its safe to say that governments are certainly opposed to this and the vast majority of people are simply scared of any kind of radical change. Few grasp the revolutionary power implicate in bitcoin, and the combination of government's inability to thwart its use and it's utile nature in the face of global hyperinflation will probably allow it to gain a foot hold of use in the market that becomes world changing.

Socialism is defined by worker control of the means of production. Central planning was a failed experiment by statists and really has nothing to do with socialism. Some of the first socialist philosophies such as mutualism are sometimes described as "free market socialism".

It sounds like you don't know much about socialism at all. You should read up on people like Josiah Warren and Proudhon. They were early libertarian socialists/anarchists who had a lot to say about money and banking.
