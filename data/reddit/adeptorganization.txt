Obviously not? By what possible metric are you responding to a bot?
If anything, your odd choice of words and verbose language and you constantly repeating yourself without saying anything new would suggest **you** are the bot here, although I assume you are not a native English speaker so that's forgiveable.
And yes, it looks to everyone else here that you've just set the profile picture to a QR code. You are being extremely cagey on the subject and not correcting anyone or elaborating in sufficient detail so I'll assume the parent commenter is correct and you're just bitter about being called out.

A somewhat misleading title.
It just states that people are moving to credit/debit card transactions over cash, and this might create some problems for some people.
This really has nothing to do with bitcoin beyond the usual issues with fiat.
@_date: 2019-03-17 16:34:47
This is not Bitcoin related.
If you're paying $3 to access your own money, that's on you. Don't accept the charge and go into the bank and withdraw for free. If everyone rejected the charge they wouldn't charge.
@_date: 2019-03-13 23:07:33
If your wallet doesn't support rbf then all you can do is wait. I would suggest using another wallet system, such as electrum, which supports this. Make sure you don't download a illegitimate fake version.
It's not crazy at all. Again, it's due to your lack of understanding.
The person receiving the bitcoin could transmit another transaction which requires your bitcoin. If they give it a high fee it may incentivise the miners to include your transaction to get the fee for their transaction. This is called child pays for parent.

You can't receive anything with that channel.
When you open a channel, you push money into "outbound" liquidity. When someone opens one with you, they give you inbound liquidity.
So basically, if you start spending you'll be able to receive those amounts again, or others need to open channels to you, and you can receive up to whatever amount they commit.

Editing the sqlite file to force clighting to show the channel as properly closed did solve the issue, but now clighting just doesn't want to allow me to withdrawn the bitcoin, even though it can see the transaction id and should know where the bitcoin is.

@_date: 2019-02-16 11:55:16
I don't.
My wealth gets stolen from me to rescue the 'too big to fail' banks and I and everyone I know gets poorer as a result. If I have 'too much' money in my account and I happen to live in the wrong country, I get a 'hair cut' where my wealth is outright stolen from me, otherwise it's just inflated away in a slow and stealthy manner so they hope I won't notice.
Even when I do the 'right' thing and avoid debt and save for my future, my savings rates go down from 5%+ to less than 1% because the government has given them so much money they have no incentive to attract mine.
Now, nearly a decade later, wages are still below 2008 levels, people are 'underemployed' desperate for full time hours but only getting 10-20 hours a week, savings rates are below 2% and these lying bastards are somehow still making more and more profit and foreclosing on houses because the banks were bailed out but the people were not, even though it was the finance sector that caused this mess.
The next crash will make 2007/2008 look tame in comparison. We will see negative interest rates as **still** nobody is learning the lesson about fixing the roof when the sun was shining. And I'll end up paying for that as well. For something which is nothing to do with me.
So no, I don't love it when a bank fails. Because instead of just letting them fail and bailing out the correct people (the customers who lost deposits), governments always react in completely the wrong way and bail out the banks instead.

In the process of setting up a store.
I've been inspired to take bitcoin and ln payment only initially, and then maybe fiat later on.
It's actually... easier? No KYC, no accounts, nothing, just me and the network, and it just works. I guess that'll change when I need a domain and fiat, but in the meantime, it's been really nice to just set stuff up myself, without permission. It's nice.
If I sell anything... That's another matter.

The status is "AWAITING\_UNILATERAL:Attempting to reconnect" and it's been like that for some time now (around a week). I have two channels like that. One has virtually nothing on it (about 10 cents), the other has roughly $11 worth of bitcoin, so I'm not too precious about recovery if it's impossible.

I don't. It just makes it easier for me to be scammed. I still "think" in fiat even though I use bitcoin where I can. I've literally spent decades thinking in fiat and changing that habit is going to be very difficult.
Even if I "thought" in bitcoin it would be difficult to keep up as the exchange rates in bitcoin are seldom stable.

Ermmm. No issue there? I shopped at bitrefill the other day, no issues, I've used the coinpanic community jar to mess about with it, fine, I've sent bits and pieces to my other devices, all good. No direct channels to any of them. It "just worked". No drama.
You don't have to open a channel directly with the store you wish to shop with. The **only** people that have ever stated that have been lying. Nobody who actually knows what they are talking about has ever said that. If you shop somewhere every day, then sure, may as well open your next channel with them directly, that just makes sense, why wouldn't you. But it's not a requirement, and never has been.
It's not "ready yet" supposedly, but I've been using lightning for the past 8ish months without too much drama. Every now and again it just hasn't worked (including one month where literally nothing worked for me, dunno why), but the rest of the time it's been fine; no money lost, no need to open a channel directly with the merchant of what you want to buy. Another 6 months and I'm very much expecting the experience to be actually flawless.

@_date: 2019-02-20 21:08:05
I upgraded. Didn't go well. I couldn't send payments (which I now understand was due to a missing plugin). Downgraded and everything was closing automatically when it came back online.
I guess something happened during the time newer version of the node was connected. Or changing back to the backup caused some drama. The backup was literally about 5 hours old and I'd done no transactions since the backup but obviously I might have routed things.
All except this channel and another one with a few cents on it closed without too much bother, although it took several days.
Really odd but I guess that's how it goes. This was always a possibility of course, so I only put on what I could afford to lose.
I'm happy to forgo the funds if we want to try something risky and fun to see if we can recover it.
Edit: would just shutting the node down force the other node to close the channel after some time of not being able to connect? I run the risk of them transmitting a older state I guess but as I only spent and didn't receive it doesn't make sense for them to do that.

Circumstantial unverified evidence is the best evidence!

No, really... have you seen the death certificate yourself? Have you checked the legal documentation around this will? If the laptop was properly encrypted how the hell would we know the cold storage address? Or is your entire comment just stuff you've already seen elsewhere?
I'm not saying it's 100% legit that he "just died". But people are getting crazy angry over "facts" that are unconfirmed and probably flat out false.

You make interesting points.
However, the onus is still on the user to protect him/herself. In the same way I drive defensively and wear a seat belt and assume that everyone else on the road is an idiot that got their license free in a pack of cornflakes, I'm also careful when I transact my wealth in both fiat and bitcoin.
Unfortunately, it seems that others prefer to just blame everyone else, and this is why I lack sympathy in those cases. Case in point here:  where the reporter of the bug outright lies and says they downloaded the 'update' from electrum.org; they know damn well what they did, they know they fucked up, still trying to blame someone else. And here,  where Cryptolista goes kinda berserk and blames everyone but himself, swearing at the devs as if they are somehow responsible.
I absolutely agree with your point that more can be done. But we're still in the early stages here. Rome wasn't built in a day, and as a user at this early point, your focus should be on having somewhat half decent knowledge on how bitcoin works and what could go wrong if you do stupid things. I spent a solid month reading into this 'nerd money' stuff before I bought my first $10.
Unfortunately it seems that most people just want to 'get rich quick' and that's all they see it as.

I now know to be more careful with upgrades and backing up the containers.
What is the best way to backup the database? I assume I can only use the sqlite system for now, which means I can easily backup one file, but backing up at the wrong moment could easily cause this to repeat. I assume if I was backing up to mysql or something I could have a snapshot at every query.
Is there a recommended way of keeping the latest version of the database safe?

Just because core doesn't support it (for obvious reasons) doesn't mean it's not possible. This is exactly why you should wait for at least one confirmation: because it's absolutely possible to replace one transaction with another one with a higher fee and you don't need specific miner cooperation for this. Consensus only happens when a transaction hits the blockchain; there is no consensus on the mempool and there should be no expectation of one.
Here's an article of people doing exactly this to attack bitcoin ATMs which accepted zero confirmation transactions: 
From the article:


The article even links to tools to achieve this. Honest wallets won't allow you to do this easily but it absolutely can be done.

I run my own electrumx server. Setting it up was not quick, not easy, especially as I use a docker stack. Even then the electrumx image I found was out of date so I had to modify it to run on the latest version of electrumx.
It was a slow, tedious, frustrating process. And the sync took forever on my mechanical hard drives. I'm not a docker expert, but I'm no noob either.
This was the only way I could figure out how to use my hardware wallet properly, without using third party services.
It was worth it, I'm glad I did it, and I use the setup frequently, but I'm absolutely not expecting my spouse, my sister, my best friend, some guy I sent a bit of bitcoin to last week because I was drunk, or my colleagues at work to go through this process. They all own bitcoin. None of them would do this.
Even with a "easy" solution, the requirements are high: "so I have to wait *how* many days before everything is synced and ready to use?".
And there are some idiots out there who still want bigger blocks on bitcoin. It's already too difficult for some, it's already too expensive resource wise, the blockchain is already too big. I don't advocate lowing the block size, but to make it larger is wholly unnecessary.

It's mentioned once in the sub-header, and once in the article:


So the only way this is bitcoin related is by people using it to mine altcoins and maybe converting to bitcoins later, as none of Nvidia's chips are capable of mining Bitcoin in any quantity these days.
So yes, this is off topic as it related to altcoin mining. I'm surprised you didn't pick up on that, yoda, given how much of a zealot you are.

It helps. This way you can have your node pay every month or whatever without having a new invoice be requested. Although I suspect invoice requesting is possibly still desirable. I have no idea if anyone is working on that.
It would also help with "here is my bitcoin address" situations, as you'd be able to give lightning network information as well as a "fire and forget" thing.

Certified man-crush over here.
Andreas not only "gets it", and seems to have been smart enough to get it from the very beginning, but he also has an outstanding skill of explaining things on a very accessible level. He's an outstanding public speaker and you can really understand how passionate he is in this experiment.
He's one of the first people I saw that not only explained what bitcoin is and how it works, but more importantly the "why". The why is more important than the technical "how" in my opinion, and it's what truly got me excited by this technology and spend hundreds of hours using it. Once you understand the why, the how will eventually come. Even if it's just "how do I use this thing" instead of "how does this work".

Exchanges like Coinbase were spamming the network last year. Every time a user made a withdrawal a new transaction was made.
Transaction batching is now the norm. So these days withdrawing comes with a small delay, where the exchange will batch up a couple of minutes of withdrawals into one transaction.
So the transaction count may be down, but the people using it... Maybe, maybe not. I'm too lazy to figure it out.

Okay, slight error on my part with the config. Should have been:








Now btc-rpc-explorer queries Electrum. Although you will struggle with addresses with a lot of history. If you see a "response too large" message in your log: 






Then you are affected by bug 67: [ Sadly this is a upstream bug in ElectrumX which the explorer folks are not able/willing to fix. You can test this yourself by looking up address 31w3iWUN5EMJMW2YRCc5m4RFqm3zN61xK2 as a query in rpc-explorer and seeing if it warns of you that bug and checking you log files. Address 35QER3vShYhsXi63NLLGCtHZEBNFUGseCR should bring in history normally.
Worth noting I don't own either of these addresses and have no idea who they belong to. I just clicked random addresses in a recent block.
@_date: 2018-12-09 08:49:10
It's really simple: tightening the rules, making them more restrictive, can be done with a soft fork. This is because older nodes will still see everything as valid. This would be the same if we wanted to reduce the block size, for example. Older nodes would see smaller blocks but they see that all the time already, so no big deal.
Making the rules more permissive would require a hard fork, as older nodes would see a breach in the rules, such as doubling the block size.
The great thing about your specific example is that the *this has already happened*. Miners have already not claimed the full amount sometimes (usually due to software bugs) and the network just carried on. This would probably need a segwit style signalling process, but it absolutely would be doable without hard forking.
You lost. Hand over the money.
@_date: 2018-12-31 22:41:08
Are you really running it on 8000? That isn't the standard port.
As long as ElectrumX and Bitcoin Core is fully synchronized you shouldn't have any drama with it. Test by connecting Electrum to it.
Having said that, I'm not able to see any transaction history on an address right now. So maybe something is broken as it doesn't seem to want to query the electrum server even though it notes that one is set up. Strange.
This is the relevant part of my config if this is any help:

Most/All wallets (at least ones I have used) require you to verify the seed given by literally typing in some or all of it  before allowing you to get receiving addresses.

My NFC experience has been *flawless* with Google pay. Never failed once and I don't even need to 'tap' the phone; just holding it close is enough. I don't even need to open app first. Just unlock the phone and wave it vaguely at the terminal. I have it down to a fine art of picking up the phone and unlocking with fingerprint in one motion. It's glorious.
Much faster and easier than QC codes. Although I wouldn't call them difficult either. But the ux with NFC has been brilliant in my eyes and I look forward to having the same experience with bitcoin and lighting network one day, eventually.

@_date: 2018-12-27 09:58:43
Lol. Believe that if you want.
Lightning is still very experimental. Go in with the expectation you'll lose everything and price the risk accordingly. If losing $50 of bitcoin isn't something you can stomach, keep using regular bitcoin wallets for now. But also keep an eye on this tech, it will make a huge difference. So far I've lost nothing, for what that's worth.
I can't tell you what's on iOS. You'll have to research that yourself.
@_date: 2018-12-31 22:58:13
Uhhh, no. That's just clothing with a "lightning bolt" logo on it. Nothing about crypto in there at all.
@_date: 2018-12-27 08:55:41
Sure. But this way I have access to the same wallet. Not a phone wallet or a pc wallet. The **same** wallet. Which with lightning is a little tricky right now.
With regular wallets it's just restoring the recovery on multiple wallets. With lightning it's .... Something else that I don't really understand right now. I'm still learning!
@_date: 2018-12-26 17:52:08
You ask clighting for an address and send regular bitcoin to it. From there it can be used to open channels within the Spark wallet GUI.
So it's bitcoin core &gt; clighting &gt; spark wallet. Not super simple to get your head around if you're not used to messing with this stuff. Although I managed bitcoin core &gt; electrumx &gt; electrum before so I knew this is possible within my knowledge. It's nice to self host, even if the experience is much harder than the noob way of doing it and trusting random servers.
I can connect many instances of Spark to clighting and access the same funds everywhere, which is the attractive part of this setup. Spark will run on a web browser although Android and Desktop clients can be used as well. I can literally be the other side of the planet and it will still work on **my node** as long as I'm able to connect.
I'm having issues receiving anything currently, I think my VPN is confusing everything. I'm closing the current channel so I can reopen a other one with different settings which I think will fix it. So thanks for the tip, I'll hopefully be collecting it when I figure it out!
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:36:09
Transaction went to this site: [ where you can push and pull tiny amounts to play about with. Have fun!
@_date: 2018-12-31 22:55:50
It beats the alternative of having a massive database full of transactions. Urgh. I know I'm technically doing that with ElectrumX already, but at least I can then use Electrum to connect to it and make it useful beyond just the explorer.
Only issue is this bug which can affect addresses with a lot of history: [
@_date: 2018-12-27 09:39:11
Lightning does, yeah.
No waiting around for confirmations. Takes a few seconds and the other party has the money and sends the goods. Easy. And way cheaper once the channel is set up.
Eclair wallet does this already on Android. I'm just doing it a complicated way for... Reasons.

It's hilarious how many times my new account has been called out when I've actually been here for many years.
One kid even said he "out ranked" me and I should be thankful he's even replying to me because his account was about a year old. Which was funny to me as we were attempting to help him after he got scammed out some of his coins. He absolutely sounded like a 12 year old though.

You can have your 32mb on a altcoin that supports it.
In the mean time my node has to store every single transaction. Ever. I already use too much bandwidth and CPU and storage being part of this horrendously inefficient distributed database, which only got worse with segwit. This stupid Blockchain is now larger than my media collection. And it grows. All the fucking time. Every 10 god damn minutes. I'm tired of storing yours and everyone else's transactions, but that's the price of financial freedom so I'll pay it.
If I needed to store 32mb every ten minutes, I would literally have to build a new pc and go into "blocks only" mode to keep within some sane bandwidth usage. Yeah, no, fuck that noise.
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:23:04
He's not a technical guy. He's a fucking idiot. He was deliberately doing everything the hard way when all he had to do was install eclair on an Android device and play about with it using the default settings. And then he could of tried the more advanced stuff.
Instead he compiled from source. Didn't read the instructions and made a bunch of half ass guesses at how the software should work and wrote a bullshit propaganda article when it didn't work properly because he was trying to run before he could walk. He had no clue what he was doing but tried to pass himself off as an expert.
Unfortunately it seems it worked on at least a few people as I'm now having to set the record straight here. Yet again we're having to correct the record on completely incorrect FUD from people pushing agendas.
If you want to try lighting you can do so right now. Download eclair wallet for Android, move $50 to it. Open a channel to Acinq's node. Wait for that to all settle down (needs 6 confirmations) go to joltfun or bitrefill and give it a go. A few months ago every payment I did was failing, but I've had no issues for the past 6 months at least. Bitrefill once didn't detect the payment but a couple of emails sorted that out and that was 100% bitrefill's fault. I've not lost a single satoshi yet, but this is still very much work in progress and your mileage may vary. But it's a bit of fun for $50. Bargain in my eyes even if you lose the money.
Lightning network is a fantastic part of the solution for scaling bitcoin and you really should try it out today if you haven't already. Don't worry about the FUDsters, they are pushing their agenda. Try it the noob way and enjoy it. If you can bitcoin, you can lightning network.
