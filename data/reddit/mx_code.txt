seems kinda stable at $16200, equal amounts of buy and sell.. 
As I say: stable, surprised after the buy momentum we've seen yday and today
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:34:30
How long did it take you to cash out your initial investment?
I'm assuming you duplicated your investment and then took out 50% or something like that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:46:17
So GDAX reached $19,500.00 for about a minute.... 
Does that count as an ATH?
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:37:00
People like you are the reason why click bait and sensationalism exist in the world.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:43:49
How much money have you invested in crypto?
We will have one major crash and see how many shitposters will be left laughing... Meme... it's easy to laugh when you have no skin in the game.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:51:29
LOL... same as trading right? 
We calculate bitcoin's daily rise multiply by 2, set stop order at that point and profit... ready for anything.

Right, so you have no considerable investments in cryptocurrencies and you are hanging along for the rollercoaster ride and the quick buck. 
Also, it seems you have absolutely zero interest in the underlying technology as if you had any interest you would easily see that if the crypto market crashes the psychological effect on the masses will be massive... it would take years for the market to recover from a real crash.
But yes, as you say... it's just memes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:39:48
it is for me, but I was already logged in
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:43:44
And for some reason you don't think whales dump thousands of coins at a given point to manipulate the price?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:41:06
I'm not going to laugh at you.
I'm simply going to tell you that you didn't HODL,.

he's spreading FUD. he's a "market influencer"
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:21:51
No shit sherlock... 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:48:19
Great idea OP, it can not be commended enough.
I just want to mention that it would be great to see the impact on donations on a global scale, however since the website is only in english a lot of foundations worldwide won't get the chance to be benefited (non english speaking countries).
Edit: 
Additionally, you are doing wonders to show the value of bitcoin to the world. 
You are able to set up a wallet, validate you have the coins and transfer them to charities while keeping full anonimity.  KUDOS! so happy to see this in the bitcoin world
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:43:58
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:46:35
Na bro, it's a wild rise... but considering how quickly it went up the past 2 days when it drops/corrects nobody will be ready on time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:17:03
This is us at the moment:
And bitcoin is the quickie guy... can anyone turn this into a bitcoin gif?
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:48:38
Get out of here
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:37:34
GDAX back online people
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:40:24
You're an idiot, an absolute idiot
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:33:12
you don't understand the technology and don't understand economics and finance, so just leave... don't let the door hit you on the way out.
the people who did understand the technology were here long before you, let the big boys do their thing.
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:10:54
Nothing but rallies???? 
June through july was a terrible bear market... it was full of "end of bitcoin" attention, there was a massive correction, really... if this is your market analysis.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:00:13
hahaha.... I think this will be the mother of all corrections, so $400 dollars over the span of 4 hours is super slow.
IF a correction comes when it comes it will be much faster.
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:07:37
people losing modesty as usual... lol, we'll see how people keep this up during the next meltdown.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:21:03
Dan Bilzerian invested since the last 3000 ATH, in fact when he actually invested that's when the correction happened.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:31:28
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:18:41
Plz do... I like cheaper coins!!!
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:13:49
mmm... you think this is over? 
What if it stabilizes for a week and then rises another $1000? 
What if goes down to $500...
some advice: there's a reason why people just hodl.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:18:17
why? how much have you really made?
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:53:12
man... the line for that dip must be pretty freaking long. 
Have you also started working on a time machine?
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:42:53
What about it? They sent an e-mail beforehand, so it's not as if people were not warned
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:40:56
You call this a correction? ...
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:24:12
It had been going up so high, that when it shifted it really felt that we were going to go down hard...  I thought it would be a disaster.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:12:02
I've been hearing the "psychological borderline" argument everywhere throughout this year:
At 2k 
At 5k 
And now you at 10k...

The FOMO is strong in this one.
@_date: 2015-07-02 05:33:01
"The new generation, which is into selfies ... I think they'll find it cool."
I think this quote in the article is enough to explain how relevant this actually is...
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:49:52
Bitcoin is finding it's correct price... it lied dormant for years.
We will see a strong correction at some point and chaos will ensue.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:57:43
You're wrong...
ITT: people who were late to the party and are butthurt so they need to vent out.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:12:01
spoke to soon, went down again.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:47:45
Seems like cool Dan Bilzerian just sold his coins for the quick profit.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:47:25
BUY MOAR!!!! 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:08:09
Watch this: 
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:04:16
The modern day version of those dudes that go around beaches with metal detectors... nothing bad with doing it! best of lucks with it!
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:45:40
It's the power of the COIN!!! are you a believer now?
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:29:03
Good thing your feelings are irrelevant to the market.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:53:28
BTC is the stock market on steroids... 


LOL, that may be an understatement.
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:16:24
I feel this will be another speculation week... $2500, will be the start of the week and I don't want to imagine where it will be by friday. 
Alas, the stability after the $600 crash couldn't last for long. You fools are too addicted to the rollercoaster.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:14:58
When it's time to sell you won't even be able to react...
This was just a minor correction, BTC has been consolidating at 2800 for around 2 weeks now.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:11:48
This rise is not even close to the one from two weeks ago, this hype train still has some steam to run with! once it goes over the $3300 mark I'd start worrying.. for now just enjoy the fun!!!!
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:56:12
Na... american speculators are just waking up, they'll short it and will come down to 2800. 2800 has been a steady price for some time now.
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:35:54
Time outs and the website stops loading due to the spike in users. They'll be able to get the site back up but app remains unusable, just be careful with your coins man.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:28:01
chastised by fire... you will come out a stronger man after this.
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:34:43
Choo Choo!!!!
Edit: 
It's going up fast!!! you guys are throwing all your rationale out the window... FOMOers welcome aboard!!!
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:01:41
Yes, given Bitcoin volatility 2 or 3 days is a lot...
2,800 was the previous ATH. 
Fell down all the way to 2,300 and slowly climbed to 2,800 where it stabilized for quite some time.
I don't understand the purpose of your comment.
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:40:38
There's been this kind of uncertainty, bearwhale dumped because of uncertainty and look where we are now...
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:10:09
that's why we do it.... only way to relieve some of the stress... now chill and get on board of the hype train!
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:25:18
All Aboard!!! this is 2 weeks ago all over again!!!
Edit: Yes, this is definitely the same thing all over again. Coinbase is already down.
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:38:35
Bubble? Which bubble? Everyone knew it was overvalued and expected a correction... only people dumping are the new people...
People even expect it to go to 3 digits later in the month, what are you trying to prove here? your ignorance?
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:52:56
SELL!!! SELL!! HODL!!! 
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:50:24
So, I see a lot of comments without value in this thread. 
I will post my reasoning behind this:
I would think that this store is giving customers another option for remmittances, which is brilliant.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:35:29
Same as he's paying the price for the decision of starting to invest ..
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:52:22
NP, it seems this will be a fun week on the rollercoaster! (scary tbh)...
Just so I get some understanding of the new people getting into BTC, what made you invest at this point? please don't mention quantities but do you see it as a risky investment?
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:09:35
you call a 100 dollars a huge low??? lol, you must be new around here.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:30:41
No shit Sherlock
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:54:53
Wait until it goes to 1900 and then we'll talk...
