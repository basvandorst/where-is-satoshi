Actually I was I South Africa 6 month ago, and you could see they were really interested in bitcoin. Way more than in France at the same time. But now interest piked pretty much everywhere.
EDIT: in South Africa, and spiked, not piked.

Hey, can someone explain to me the relation between LN and smart contract ?
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:55:34
woops, in South Africa, for a semester abroad, and I meant spiked*
I'm not gonna correct it, it's quite funny.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:27:20
But what is X ? Bitcoin drop to 10 confirmed ? Wait, but 10 what ? It dropped to $10k already.

You should make a search in the subreddit. It was discussed and bcash supported gave their explanation. I don't remember it as I don't really care about bcash, but I remember they gave one. Might be bullshit tho.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:55:24
Maybe he thought it was tweeter.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:23:12
Oh ok. I still have to do some reading about rootstock.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:43:52
ahah ok, I was messing with you. I find 5k to be quite low, but maybe you're right. I think 5k would need a tether collapse.
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:25:49
Yeah I made a withdrawal from gdax yesterday and it wasn't batched.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:05:35
Ahah yeah of course.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:48:08
Not if you sell at the bottom.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:48:54
They are literally unlimited, with no value. Actually their value is to have no value. It is used to test networks.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:51:56
Yes. But to be fair they need this premium cas if you put a big order that move the market.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:57:13
Damn, that stinks.
@_date: 2018-10-03 11:45:07
Yeah and he's implying that coinbase doesn't have a full reserve. Which I find dumb but everyone can believe what he wants.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:11:41
Well it's usually the case in any pair trading. When the dollar is going up the euro is going down, and vice versa. But I'm totally not an expert.
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:52:46
That was the lock-in to lock everyone in doing this lock-in. From what I understand, segwit should be activated in around 14+2 days.

Can I pre-sell BCC on kraken ?
I wont be available at the exact time of the fork and I Would like to know if I can put it on sale before ? I seem to understand that it can be done on viaBTC, but my coins are already on kraken.
@_date: 2016-12-16 01:02:55
How, sorry then I haven't really check, it's just the case in bitstamp.
@_date: 2016-11-09 16:25:25
Well, not those I lost on an old computer a long time ago...
@_date: 2016-12-15 20:37:51
And because/thanks to that Bitcoin is at an all time High in euro-conversion.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:35:11
I think it should be easily achievable with a basic smart contract.
But I'm no expert, so I hope someone else will answer.

I actually had the same happen to me back before Mtgox. But I sadly listened to my parents (and was to young anyways to buy some alone). But I still bought some after, but by paypal (was a pain in the ass, and with like 20% fees). But I didn't told them after, just show them the price from time to time. I actually think I'll offer them some on Christmas, like that they'll see the price going up, but even more they might get interrested in the tech and what opportunity it offers.
I think a lot of people would really like what bitcoin is about, but the money make it too intimidating.
Also, if my parents were on board, I would mostly have lost most in mtgox so... I guess it's ok.

Damn, Litecoin is at more than 50% !

April 5 is also the date of the Tiananmen incident.

Yeah I usually at least watch/listen to his YouTube, but I got to admit I haven't found the time for quite some months now.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:42:20
Well, The one I was referring took place in 76 (wiki:  
While the one which is well known took place later, in 89 (wiki:  and was marked by the massacre that took place on June 4/5.

You've just given me the words I could never find, they can't prove immutability.
@_date: 2018-04-03 23:59:23
That's really cool ! Could I ask you to make one for nano ? that's some of the more beautiful icon I saw !
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:38:23
In bitcoin, or blockchains in general, you don't have to do anything to "receive" the funds, so no. The funds are just designated to an adress, for instence yours. to move them, then you need the key associated to the address, so you can "sign" the transaction to prove it's you trying to move it. I hope it's clear.
However what you ask is true for some other cryptos, some that aren't purely blockchain. For exemple with nano (the currency) you actually need to "sign" the fact you received funds, but you can do it at anytime.

Wooch, you weren't kidding. People are talking about Indians workers... WTF
@_date: 2015-10-14 00:12:13
Omg, now I'm always scared than it's a picture of a literal imgur mirror.
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:21:56
yeah same, but anyways I would have needed the money for my next semester, so I just could have lost less bitcoins...
@_date: 2015-02-28 21:10:28
 I'm pretty sure the killer is this hacker. you know, this "4chan"
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:49:58
Damn, I just figured it out. I thought it was !ntip so I was lost, like why "n" ? I even dumbly thought it was about nchain so maybe bsv and I couldn't understand why it was authorized on the sub. But it's ln, I'm so dumb...
