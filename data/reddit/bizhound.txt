Do you live in a bubble? Huge hack over $500 million in coins stolen. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:29:08
$400 million of any crypto off a major exchange would shake some confidence short term?

Or sell at $17k like me friends did too buy more on dip. Wish I would have listened.
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:21:51
I'm afraid to sell and watch it go higher.

You can buy BTC from Coinbase and transfer to exchange like Bittrex.

When you sell the BCH it will convert to BTC. Click on symbol and choose how much and what cost you're selling for.

My buddy tried to convince my friends and I to buy at $32. Of course we talked him out of the stupid idea and I started buying at $600.

Yes that HODL mentality only works on BTC. Everyone screaming HODL on shitcoins are just digging themselves into long term pain. Not sure why crypto traders are against cut and run. Once I start losing I cut and run. I learned the hard way too.

I just did at the tippy top!!!

Buy half of what your willing to lose now and cost average down if there is a correction. You could also cost average up if it settles higher. I thought it was too late in the $400's .

Pump and dump? I think it the uncertainty of the Hard Fork. Scared money is running for the hills and we will most likely see lower prices. Next few weeks are great buying opportunities.
