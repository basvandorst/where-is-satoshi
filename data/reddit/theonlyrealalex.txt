No, and no. But you can't win if you don't play. It COULD still be intact and the process COULD preserve the data.

Miracle Max: Whoo-hoo-hoo, look who knows so much. It just so happens that your friend here is only MOSTLY dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive.

To quote the princess bride, "There is a big difference between mostly dead and all dead."
Legally dead does not equal information-theoretically dead.
"A person is dead according to the information-theoretic criterion if their memories, personality, hopes, dreams, etc. have been destroyed in the information-theoretic sense. That is, if the structures in the brain that encode memory and personality have been so disrupted that it is no longer possible in principle to restore them to an appropriate functional state, then the person is dead. If the structures that encode memory and personality are sufficiently intact that inference of the memory and personality are feasible in principle, and therefore restoration to an appropriate functional state is likewise feasible in principle, then the person is not dead."

Cryopreservationists argue that a legally dead body is not what is called "information theoretically dead" yet, and that storing a body in a vitrified (not technically frozen) state, MAY cause the information that encodes a person's personality to be stored indefinitely, but no one really knows.
But hey, why not give it a shot? I've spent money on WAY more useless/stupid things.
