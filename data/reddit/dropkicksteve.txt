There's nothing wrong with bitcoin. As long as the market cap is small, pump &amp; dump will continue to happen because there is money to be made. I thought you guys were long term investors

It's ok I'm a software engineer and it took me a while to figure out how it worked. But it might get to a point where people will follow without the need for them to understand

What I can't get my mind around, is the actual implementation of a bitcoin economy, when there is no liquidity. It promotes hoarding so most people are not willing to sell, or even spend. This is what causes the crazy fluctuations in price and I don't understand how this volatility will ever even out.

Is there someone in this subreddit who has cashed out a large amount of btc on coinbase or another exchange? How does one cash out on 5 btc? Are there issues with the exchange, do they make it difficult? How about your bank? Do you have to pay taxes on the fiat?

Read what you said, but slowly

I'm surprised dumb posts like this get upvotes
@_date: 2019-11-13 12:34:12
Fair enough I say. Until it all becomes much simpler for the average person, bitcoin will remain a speculation

It helps that it exports so much oil

Poor cash management based on what? If they need the money now that is when they sell.

Good for you hopefully you can stop looking at the chart and get a life

It could be actually if the hacker-s are dumping what they stole
@_date: 2019-10-23 09:27:22
And how exactly are we supposed to buy btc then?

I agree with you on the report. But what world do you live in? Because I live in a world where a large percentage of the population can't even use computers properly except for fundamental activities, let alone understand bitcoin. It is a technology in its infancy, so be patient. In the end, disruptive technologies like this one always prevail.

All the rest are just cringy you are right

You "stack sats" is what you meant I think... that expression gets on my nerves

You give a rough estimate of 50 years, but you check the price every 10 minutes

That is one aspect of it I am suspicious of, what you say about hodling being self defeating. All the gollums of btc don't want to actually use their btc for transactions, they just want you to buy it so they can become some sort of oligarchs in the future.

There is NO Blockchain without the incentive for miners to do all the hard work Mr. genius. Come back with another well thought argument, (done by others and parroted around)
