What makes you think the value per coin will be in the $2200.00 range?

Ok, so there is only so much coin that can be mined over time, but the value will continue to grow until ... what? The collapse of the US dollar? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:15:43
How many currency units are expected to be mined in the next coming months? What is the current mine rate?
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:54:07
Also, right now the market it showing 12MM in Bitcoins so the idea is that another 9 MM will be mined... Then what happens?

Ok. I am folliwing now. But A) WTF does that mean and 2) where are people getting this 21 million coin cap number from? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:18:24
But the mine rate has to drop considerably for the valuation to keep going up right? Or is the demand right now surpassing the rate that coins can be mined?

Right! Then that gets cut in half when phase 3 takes hold or something... Right???

Ok. That helps. I am really close to pulling the trigger on my first coin. Just shooting out questions. I do have one more... How is a coin $900? I just can't wrap my head around that!!!

What makes you think there will be a market correction? Who drives the correction anyway? People selling off their bitcoins for cash?

Kahn Academy has videos. I was you 5 hours ago, now I own my first BTC:

I understand your frustrations here. Hang with me though. I don't understand how there is a hard limit set on the number of units available. Why is it 21 MM?
