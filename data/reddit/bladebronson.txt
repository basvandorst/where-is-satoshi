The DMV actually REALLY cares what kind of car I drive.

Except the pizza place didn’t directly receive the BTC. Somebody paid them in USD, had the pizzas delivered and was repaid in BTC.

Me too. I was initially surprised by the idea of a 15 year old veteran coder but then thought, "yeah, I can see that."

It's way better than my first breakdown which had me losing money. :) There's also a cost of physical goods (the papers and the capsules), so the whole machine runs at a loss. But, it's just something I made for fun, so I'm not too bothered by it.

This is a Raspberry Pi-powered Satoshi Dice vending machine that I built last week as part of a ChangeTip hackathon. I'll try to bring it around to some bitcoin meetups in San Francisco so you can play. 
Shoutout to Blockcypher's fantastic webhook API.

Thank you for accepting Bitcoin - I wish more restaurants did! I'd like to send you $25 in bitcoin for a specific purpose: Would you please use it to surprise one of your customers with a free meal from me? Thanks again! @_date: 2017-04-25 23:30:18
Worlds collide. ;)

So no Bitcoin Stories?

I’d like a wallet that does exactly this.

I was super duper bored, so I looked at it.

Ironic choice, considering the history of McDonalds.

No, let’s! It was a hilarious example to use and the added mud is interesting.

I watched the video. I could hear him just fine.
