You don't need to overthrow government... Just get enough people to stop believing in it as legitimate and recognize it for what it is; A violent gang of men and women forcing us to pay them.

Explain how taxes are not theft please.
@_date: 2014-12-15 00:33:14
Oh okay a "government official" stated something, we can accept that as truth now. They are going to "allow" us to do what we were going to do regardless of their acceptance. These people (those that call themselves government) need to be regarded as control freaks that believe they have the right to tell others how to live their lives under the threat of violence.

That is the whole issue with giving a group of people special powers over others.
@_date: 2014-06-07 16:59:28
Yes, actually. It's called national debt though.
@_date: 2014-06-07 14:35:51
That really didn't answer the question, but just created an imaginary condition on which taxes are acceptable. Last time I checked, infants cannot understand contracts and lack the ability to sign them.

Also the experience gained...

This is great news. It will only lead to more exposure.

Wow nice! Weird that I just did something similar with arduino yesterday

I would argue that theft is taking property without permission. Compensation is what would happen in a voluntary transaction. If a guy sticks a gun in your face and demands your wallet and then offers to buy you lunch, does that make up for the fact that he used violence to take possession of your wallet?

The whole thing is interesting to watch and I would be amazed if the pre-selected candidate doesn't win but since I have no horse in this race... 
Down with the crown. No masters, no slaves!

Thieving scumbags.

Sure, I know it is splitting hairs... just wanted to point out that no one really wants to pay taxes, they just forfeit to the threat of violence.

Buyer beware?
@_date: 2013-09-18 20:45:58
Say that a common thief comes up to you and demands your wallet then offers to buy you something nice with part of your money, will you enjoy that nice thing he bought you the same amount had you just bought it on your own accord?

Well put, however, I'm guessing that the actual percentage stolen is much higher than what is withheld from income after adding in inflation and unfunded liabilities not to mention the emotional damage due to living like a faux slave which hinders the motivation to be more productive.

Just because that it has worked in this manner, does that make it morally justifiable? Do you think I should be robbed, put in a cage or murdered if I have a different opinion on how these services should be rendered? Not mocking you, genuinely curious.
@_date: 2013-09-18 20:29:53
I just want to understand... are you claiming that we do not own ourselves and that our time on this rock belongs to others just because we were accidentally born here and we interact with existing concepts which were the product of time spent by others? 
One could argue that everything in human existence is an abstraction of made up concepts. Ownership, however, does have merit as what you do with your life and produce are of limited resource because you will eventually die and to have that time stolen from you by others who believe they are owed your time is inherently wrong.
@_date: 2013-09-18 15:00:02
So are you saying that the only way to get these types of services is by forcing people at the barrel of a gun to pay for them? 
@_date: 2013-09-18 13:27:18
... One dosen't pay taxes, your earnings are extracted from you via force. Taxation is theft. If you still want to pay voluntarily, then it is no longer a tax and rather a service you are willing to pay for.
