this is intriguing! how exactly works? do you use it?
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:31:44
if $50 is too much, you shouldnt have bought it
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:32:24
This is so fucking dumb
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:34:40
which exchange did you use?
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:58:55


why this?
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:58:52
it doesnt have fees?
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:00:24
the market.
same market who decides what the price of an Euro is.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:03:04
how can you trade on poloniex then
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:08:17
so the fee could be bigger than the transfer? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:30:09
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:50:47
thanks for this
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:19:57
how's a 15% fee low? :/
Im paying $3 for for $20 transaction
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:58:11
this is a big problem though.
Bitcoin will never go mainstream if it's more expensive than all other payment methods.
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:30:08
something like $100
mycelium doesnt work in my country.
have you tried paxful? it seems "too" easy
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:03:27
which exchange do you use?
I cant use coinbase as Im not in america.
Which has the lowest fees?
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:44:56
Good question. High fees prevent bitcoin right now from going mainstream.
I paid $3 for a $20 transaction. Imagine a store telling you that.
I do think it's a bubble, but hey, it might not be.
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:02:02
Nobody knows this
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:46:06
No its not. Gold is still a huge standard. Has been for centuries. Bitcoin is just 8 years old
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:02:38
exactly lol
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:37:23
yeah sure. 
send me the 16numbers of your credit card, and I will
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:03:46
This begs the question. What will happen when all the Bitcoins are mined? 
What incentive is there to mine anymore?
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:00:35
of course.
I thought maybe there's a wallet which works as exchange too. A desktop one.
I read it somewhere in this sub about a specific software which was a wallet and an exchange. I cant remember what was it
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:37:56
and after this?
Import the keys to electrum?
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:50:04
yes. 15% fee is too much
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:36:37


how much were the fees?
did you get $50 worth of BTC or less?
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:28:39
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:33:38
dont you find these type of threads nothing but cringe which brings nothing to the community?
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:33:34
where can I buy with smaller fees?
like 1$-3$?
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:37:24
Thanks this helps.
I didn't transfer the coins from QT to Electrum. Its the same address, same keys both wallets
So, if after a year i decide to use QT again, the old wallet.dat will get synced and show all the transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:34:58
so how about that I paid $3 for a $20 transaction?
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:07:03
not possible in my country.
Also, cant buy on Kraken, Poloniex and Paxful
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:29:35
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:59:42
you are rewarded for your computational power, which in itself is valuable.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:52:16
have you tried it?
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:48:26
These low quality shitposts are stupid
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:39:18
which wallet are you using?
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:53:19
eli5? what are makers?
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:45:10
hmm no. can you buy with debit/credit cards there?
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:29:48
Im still at $3 fee for $20 transaction.
this is ridiculous
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:29:08
People do that even without cryptos tho
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:34:36
can you buy with VISA?
im afraid they wont support my bank
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:58:05
great points.
I personally believe Bitcoin is here to stay. Just like the internet, it'll be essential and force some institutions to become obsolete.
That being said, I want to read articles which think Bitcoin will fail.
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:45:59
this thread is a proof of the opposite
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:21:28








how old are you?
I didnt attack you did you?
why are you turning this into a personal thing?
I get it that you dont like the discurs, but dont fall into the 13yearoldxboxcounterstrike user 
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:25:28
ok you dumbfuck, go play some counterstrike
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:24:27
I couldve paid with Paypal and pay exactly $40.82, no more no less.
Why would anyone use bitcoin (or crypto) for daily purchases is beyond me
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:17:14
Even if it was. If Bitcoin cannot handle this attack, then it's not something I want to invest to.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:27:52
it is. 1 in 4 posts is deleted
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:14:52
I had exodus. I'll never use it again.
Copy the private key and import it in Electrum
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:24:26
If everyone holds bitcoin, who's gonna transact it?
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:30:36
shhh dont use logic here man.
just post memes, hodl, fud and you'll get upvoted
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:47:05
There was also a dude who sold bitcoin cash at 300 and bought bitcoin at 700
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:29:47
yeah no.
send me $350k so I'll post an ad on WSJ, is still scammy
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:11:55
Does it matter?
BTC is not one person.
I'm sure some shady dudes are associated with Bitcoin too. But who cares. Crypto does not depend on one person
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:10:11
Brand? Who owns it?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:50:08
holy shit
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:43:50
im trying to get at the core of bitcoins technology.
is this a flaw these guys are using? and how to prevent one angry guy from disrupting the market?
what if he had succeeded? 
bitcoin fell from 7800 to 5600 and bitcoin cash rose from 300 to 2400, all because of him?? there's something wrong here.
he can manipulate it as he wants and get massive gains, others can do it too. There's no decentralization then
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:48:01
I dont know man , im just trying to figure out a paradox.
Either Roger Ver attacked bitcoin and caused it to crash. Then this means 1 person can manipulate the whole network.
Or he didnt attack bitcoin. Then this means the network cannot handle that many transactions. Thats why the backlog, thats why high fees.
choose one
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:23:10
name me 1 company/technology/product worth more 
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:51:54


this is always where it ends. It's sad.
if one rises a problem with bitcoin the answer is "dont use it then. Use paypal"
is this what we've come to?
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:29:55
if you dont want or cant cashout in dollars, you cashout in tethers. Like an altcoin. Its priced at $1.
But it has no cap. Its printed and printed in the millions. And it coincides with the btc price going up
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:34:56
just use bitcoin cash man. highest fee is $0.1
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:34:22
he's just selling and buying, thats what traders do.
how is it a scam?
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:32:00
yes finally a logic argument.
of course, I never said transactions would be lost. My issue was with the backlogs and the fact that major exchanges stopped bitcoin transactions.
why did that happen and can it happen again?
the fact that one millionaire can manipulate the price is a scary thing too.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:37:24
No you wont be
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:26:14
What if it doesn't 
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:53:33
but right there on the sidebar it says "...it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks."
which turns out it's not true. Bitcoin (crypto) is no better than any other stock in terms of market manipulation then.
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:24:38
he used them to pay for his luxury home
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:28:33
no crypto is worth in the trillions
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:31:08
tethers are printed money
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:43:47
how old are you?
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:08:22
tbh you cant  use bitcoin at the stores too.
with these ridiculous fees
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:12:09
bitcoin at its core is a technology.
a technology is worth what does it provide to its users.
a technology which just offers anonymous, semi-cheap payments cannot be worth more than the entire GDP of the United States.
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:23:10
yeah right. there are no whales manipulating the bitcoin price to their gains. sure
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:50:10
probably never
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:28:32
how is he wrecking people's lives?
this is written in every post here. Is he forcing people to use bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:24:16
If everyone holds, there would be no transactions
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:18:30
why does he tweet only about bitcoin?
hes the creator of litecoin
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:58:21
it's childish and stupid. yet its on the front page. Which means this sub loves it
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:30:48
thats what we've all been saying.
let the market decide.
But here's the mentality "FUCK THE MARKET"
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:14:47
Nobody worships him. We worship the technology.
I couldn't care less about ver
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:40:32
My bet is ethereum
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:50:56
how is he scamming people?
genuinely curious
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:11:20
also dont masturbate too much
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:37:06
if Bitcoin is so fragile, then we shouldnt use it, should we?
whats stopping these "criminals" to do it over and over again?
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:29:46
because it goes with the narrative thats why its allowed
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:58:09
oh i get it, 16 then.
good luck with your acne
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:38:51
another millionaire can do it then.
a chinese one who hates bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:59:12


2 days ago,  all posts here were about how roger ver is attacking bitcoin. the price did crash from 7800 to 5800. backlog was huge, transactions were not going through.
gamini, coinbase, shapeshift suspended all bitcoin transactions.
I call this a problem, even if it was temporary
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:15:59
later this month
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:47:32
why is he to blame?
did he force you to buy ?
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:04:42
so bitcoin will be worth more than the entire GDP of the United States?
That's an economical paradox
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:45:44
so does this mean bitcoin has a flaw which allows one person to manipulate it?
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:01:31
Do you really believe bitcoin will be worth more than google and apple together?
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:15:57
if you believe that, than you believe bitcoin can be manipulated by a group of people
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:27:28
what were the fees?
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:20:36
I thought price threads were not allowed?
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:41:52
do you fucking loser realize that paypal does the same thing?
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:26:56
this looks like a scam
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:01:49
So one guy can manipulate the price? You shouldn't invest in Bitcoin then
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:07:33
I spent $50 to buy a domain on namecheap which costs $41.
thats ridiculous
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:14:39


thats my whole point. This guy Roger Ver manipulated the whole bitcoin network? Because of him, this major exchange suspended its activities?




again my point. If you believe that all of this is being caused by an "attack" then Bitcoin isnt that "stable, decentralized" technology we believe.
According to this sub, 1 guy caused all this mayhem. Whats stopping him from doing it again tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:05:44
im not a native english speaker, sorry.
questions still stands though.
Do you believe this was an attack?
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:48:10
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:16:20
he only tweets about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:49:58
nah, hold both of them. see whichever wins
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:39:52


me too but seems like this sub is full of HODL memes teenagers :/
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:26:19
havent you noticed a weird correlation?
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:52:27
why is it tricky to sell?
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:50:55

@_date: 2017-11-08 08:18:24
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:48:42
im sorry for your sense of humour
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:50:01
but why isnt anyone using the internet to spam, since all internet traffic is treated the same
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:36:44
would you rather have DDOS and net neutrality or no ddos and no net neutrality?
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:38:35
Paypal has 0 fee transactions.
they are as secure as needed
why would a person pay $40 instead of $0?
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:50:51
how do you know?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:56:54
its called just market.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:48:13
my point is: of course there's ddos, but it doesnt affect us, its a small percentage of the internet traffic
I wouldnt sacrifice net neutrality if it meant there would be no ddos.
Analogically, in Bitcoin, we are sacrificing the "neutrality" of the network because we are scared of ddos (spam)?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:20:22
This is posted more than Steve Buscemi being in the firefighters.
theymos posts his website too here. What's the problem?

then you're already a millionaire
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:59:03
what happened?
why 90% of the posts say this was an "attack"?
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:08:43
If you couldnt withdraw and you couldnt deposit and you couldnt spend and you couldnt transact, how it was usable?
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:31:37
why does this sub hate Vitalik now?
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:27:24
Do we need the front page filled with the price of bitcoin in every fucking currency?
"$7700 BABY ATH WHOOO!"
"6000 pound woohooo!"
"4500 EURO WOOOHOO"
"100000 dollarydooos WOOHOOOO"
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:33:57
you shouldve waited after the fork.
price will go down
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:44:53
thats a good point, nothing came out of it.
But for 2 days, bitcoin was basically unusable. you couldnt withdraw or deposit to Gemini or Coinbase. You couldnt use Shapeshift. Fees were (still are) at $20.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:09:53
a btc at $1M, means bitcoin is worth $21 trillion.
entire US gdp is $18 trillion.
how is it possible for bitcoin to be worth more than the entire economics the US produces? More than all tech companies, oil companies etc etc together! Really?
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:34:41
agree with that he maybe wanted the flippening.
still, the fact that one person can cause this type of inconvenience, is scary for bitcoin, isnt it?
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:09:40
this is what bitcoin cash wants?
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:45:08
you can still get downvoted to steemit thats how a community works
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:18:00
I think it's naive to believe that there isnt any monetary  gains behind people supporting big blocks or people not supporting them.
everyone is trying to steer the water to their mill
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:31:20
yeah I wont send coins to some dudes on the internet "for the betterment of the community"
theymos did that too. now he's a millionaire and kept the coins for himself
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:15:45
because it's the biggest economy in the world
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:26:23
wasnt Bitcoin supposed to kill paypal, banks etc?
if the answer to high fees, is dont use bitcoin, then youre missing the point of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:14:10
I made the exact same post (basically) a month ago.
Got downvoted to oblivion, called shitcoin shill, altcoin pusher etc etc.
Now it's an excellent post because price is falling?
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:37:13
what about spending $17 to send $80?
how is this usable? How is this bullshit?
what about the fact that the average btc fee has skyrocketed to $17, even after Segwit? 
how is this bullshit?
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:08:49
If one or 2 persons, or even 50 persons can make Bitcoin unusable, do you really want to invest in Bitcoin though?
Isnt this a major flaw in its technology?
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:45:42
so just 2 people crashed bitcoin from 7800 to 5600?
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:02:14
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:19:06
 Bitcoin or financial stability. Pick one
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:00:11
theymos also promotes his website here
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:54:25
how do you withdraw or deposit to them without the btc network?
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:45:32
even from exchanges?
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:13:39
Not really
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:27:13
what? thats a lie
you might hate bitcoin cash but dont spread lies
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:24:58
yeaaah suuuure you can sue Google.
absolutely. Do it OP. Go and sue google
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:45:41
Neither charlie nor vitalik forked the bitcoin chain though.
bitcoin cash was forked from the original bitcoin. If the majority will use bitcoin cash then its bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:34:53
do you think this type of bullshit doesnt happen to bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:24:37
I had the (naive) idea that maybe crypto was different from stocks and no one could manipulate it
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:32:24
Can you have a calm and logic discussion about this or nah
Gemini closed withdraws and deposits.
Shapeshift closed bitcoin transactions.
Coinbase too.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:31:12
if he failed, why is this sub blaming him for the recent problems?
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:27:41
whats stopping him from doing it again
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:22:21

why is this downvoted for asking proof?
OP could be lying
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:41:09
Vitalik, owner and founder of ethereum is actively pushing people to ethereum. He's not scamming people.
All founders are actively pushing people to their coins.
If you believe they are right, you invest. Nobody is forcing you.
Besides, isnt it true that bitcoin cash has faster and cheaper transacions? How is he lying?
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:49:55
how is this upvoted to the frontpage?
you believe anything
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:30:59

We get it.
We have internet too.
Can we stop with the price update every minute?

I thought you can't do that with crypto.
I thought crypto was more secure than banks

thats a retarded thing to do, just because their CEO said Bitcoin is a fraud.

Where instead you couldve made some insane cash
@_date: 2017-09-04 05:20:54
You won't make.
IF the price goes $9000 you'll make $50.
This could happen in a year, two years? Im sure you can make $50 with a part time job in days

I would say no. 
ICOs were always illegal. in US you cant participate in an ICO.
Also, making ICOs illegal should affect new coins not old estabilished ones

Ive been mining bitcoin since 2012, since slushpool was minning.co.cz.
Im regretful I didnt buy then but I had no money, so mining was the only possibility.
I mined BTC and LTC then. Im in the crypto sphere for 5 years now, but only now I can buy some
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:20:07
Not until its less than $1000
@_date: 2017-09-12 07:51:43
cheaper fees than shapeshift?
bittrex has a 10% deposit fee while shapeshift has zero fees practically
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:41:41
because most exchanges have BTC/ALT trades.
if the volume of BTC falls, the volume of alts falls
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:13:22
its way more difficult to rise than to fall.

Im not dim.
Im just saying, if a governemt wants to makes thing difficult for you, it will and you can do nothing about it.
If China bans bitcoin, then trading on it will be an illegal thing , just like selling cocaine.
Of course you can still do it, but is it worth the risk?
Im just sayin lets just hope no government messes with it
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:27:36
it is.
no way a btc is worth $5000.
even $1000 seems too much
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:32:10
they wont. But r/bitcoin sees it as the next big thing ever where 7 billion people will use it.
No they wont. Bitcoin is only for tech oriented people.

Dude, I love the mental gymnastics you do to reach the conclusion of what **I** think.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:49:08
why are you so worried?
Bitcoin is opensource, everyone can fork it.
The market decides to use whichever they want.
How can you stop me from forking it? You cant. This is what the blockchain is about.
Let the fork happen, see which one wins and send your coins to that fork.
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:45:32
well, monero offer privacy, why cant bitcoin offer that too?
ethereum offers a platform to build other apps or coins, bitcoin cant do that.
just the top ones.
Most of my coins are bitcoin (like 90%), but bitcoin cant do more than it does right now.
If crypto really goes mainstream, bitcoin will stagnate (imo)

I think this is where we disagree. I dont think that.

Even if after 5 years a Bitcoin is worth $9000 this is gonna gonna double the investment.
Im guessing OP has bought about$50 of btc. Or lets say $100.
So after 5 years he'll have $100 more.
Im sure you can make $100 in a week if you work part time

not only this.
Novogratz says crypto will never be a currency, but to store value.
A currency is stable. You cant buy a cola with 0.000154 btc then tomorrow its worth is 0.0002312 btc. We cant even realize what those numbers mean in the daily life.
Id rather spend $1 than 0.000232 btc for a cola.
You cant buy a car with Google shares for example. You could, but most people have no idea what a google share is, how to cash on it etc,
this is the same with bitcoin

If BTC fails there are a lot more to invest to.
Ethereum, Litecoin, Zcash, Monero for example.
They are not affected by bitcoin price
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:23:51
I think the bet is not fair because I take 2 risks. One of those is the fork happening or not.
what if tomorrow all the companies decide they dont want to do the fork? They get bribed by someone and the fork doesnt happen?
why do I have to take this risk?

bitcoin is not a company, its an open source protocol.

Just like there isnt one person who can change the source code of btc, there isnt a single person who can change the supply of dollars.

Let's take an analogy.
A new altcoin will launch in November. Lets call this BestCoin.
I think this will be the best coin ever and will be worth more than Bitcoin.
I agree that IF this altcoin is launched (which I cant do nothing about it. Other players are managing it) I will give you the same amount of Bitcoin for BestCoin.
But the altcoin does not launch. The developers die in a plane crash.
Oh, I think, too bad. BestCoin would've been a great coin.
I still believe BestCoin is better than Bitcoin, but for UNFORESEEABLE circumstances, BestCoin could not see the light of the day.

whats this got to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:24:56
of course.
Im just responding to OP which says "stick only to btc because one random guy lost btc by trading"
thats,  honestly, retarded.
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:11:46
not similar.
It was streaming vs DVD. 2 completely different technologies. One is physical the other is virtual.
While Bitcoin vs paypal for example, there's no difference. You can pay in a second, for free, to everyone in the world?
What advantages does bitcoin offer over paypal, in terms of technology?

besides all my bitcoins are traded for Waves right now, price is going up so im gonna hold for a bit

I dont care about jff grzk or any of those. And you shouldnt too.
I'll have 4 different coins. (BTC, BCH, B2X, Bitcoingold)
whichever coin wins, I win.
If one coin has a vulnerability flaw, it will collapse.
If the developers of 2X intentionally put a flaw in it, the community will alert immediately.

Ethereum is an innovation.
Ethereum will be more valuable than btc imo.

How do you know that?
Why aren't you buying thousands of Bitcoins if the price will go up again?
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:16:18


Im ignoring the community behind it because right now its a bit immature imo.
Look at the front page of r/ bitcoin. 99% of posts are:
"Jamie Dirmon is a thief"
"bcash is shit"
"I just bought at 5900 and im happy"
If youre serious about bitcoin, you have to discuss it's flaws too. Like for example that there's very little innovation in almost 10 years in bitcoin

I dont know where are you reading this pessimism. But even if it was true, that doesnt change the fact that you're offering a very stupid trade no one will take.

If by final product you mean using bitcoin as we use fiat, then bitcoin is not bitcoin anymore.
Bitcoin banks, credit cards, centralization. It loses its principle.
On the other side, not all people can understand a wallet, a secret key, a fee etc.

and ported them to Monero, adding another functionality to Monero.
Im talking about the tech behind the coin, not the developers.
What room has btc to grow and not stagnate?
Its a currency? So what? So is OMG and it's taking SE asia by the storm. So is Litecoin and has lower fees. So is IOTA and has 0 fees.
The only advantage BTC has is that it was the first. But without innovation and improvements, bitcoin will be the AOL of the internet.
Google, Microsoft, Amazon will crush it.

conditions are in your favor because you take only 1 risk. Which chain will win.
the other party will take two risks. Will the split happen (which is not in their hands) and which chain will win.
Simple math tells us, you're not offering a fair trade
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:37:15
Not the risk of the fork not **working** out. But the risk of the fork not **happening**.  2 different things.
The bet Roger Ver and Charlie Lee did said that if the fork doesnt happen, they get their coins back. this is a fair bet.
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:55:24

Title says "this is why we need limited supply" and shows a picture of a fucking game.
that is not only dumb but OP doesnt understand basic economics or basic math even.
Bitcoin isnt that far from a single entity controlling the monetary supply either. Look whats happening with all these forks. Core controls every change. What if Core decides the limit is not 21Mill but 21 Bill?
your bitcoin would lose value, same as a central bank taking decisions over the dollar

Isnt it the same bitcoin it was 5 years ago?

where a bottle of water one day costs 50c one day costs $1?
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:18:37
thats not the point.
Point is to think longterm.
If after, lets say 50 years, crypto is mainstream, hype wont be enough to sustain a coin.
Why pay with bitcoin  where you can use IOTA with 0 fees for example?
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:39:40

I wont do it
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:12:25
rightfully so.
with 12k right now you can buy 2.5BTC
if the price of bitcoin goes $5000 in 3 or 4 months, he'll gain just $500. Surely you can make $500 in three months without investing all your life savings into such a volatile asset.
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:30:47
True that trading isnt easy money, but not because one guy lost 400 btc.
If you follow the coins, the team, the news, trading can be profitable.
If you just throw money to random shit coins hoping to catch a diamond, then you're just throwing a dart hoping to hit jackpot.
Would it be retarded if I made a post "Dont stick to BTC - some guy turned 200 btc to 600 btc by trading altcoins" ?

Nope, because you signed nothing when you bought bitcoin.
On one side the community doesnt want regulations and the government sticking their noses.

I dont think that big names (Coinbase, Xapo) are looking for an excuse to pull out. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:02:52
let me answer it for you.
if 60% of the community support 2x, they've made a great business decision by supporting it
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:54:15
you do it.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:57:15
If all of this is true, then the 2x will fail and collapse and miners/users will come back to bitcoin legacy.

Bitcoin right now is the Yahoo of search engines.
It's only innovation is that it was the first one. There's so much innovation outside of bitcoins.
Its true that 99% of alts are shit, but that 1% is doing something more than just "crypto currency".
I asked a question yesterday "What can Bitcoin do now at $5000 that it couldnt do at $500?". No one could answer it. Answer is nothing. Its the same bitcoin. The 10x price gain in a year is just hype, there's no substance to it and why it should be that much.
Every other alt can do what bitcoin does. Vice versa is not true.
We're still waiting for the Google of crypto to come. Til then, we're stuck with Yahoo
@_date: 2017-10-09 08:24:02
Are we looking at the same charts?
there's clearly a synchronized drop for every major altcoin. OMG, SIA, QTUM, NEXUS.
Pointless or not, people want to have both coins.
as for 2X, no one will sue. On what grounds can you sue?
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:27:25
better than investing 12k in BTC today.
it can go to $5000 and you'll gain $500
it can go to $3000 and you'll lose $4500
make your choice wisely
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:37:03
every other crypto has those

this is so dumb.

Do nothing.
Hold your bitcoins in your personal PC wallet.
Let this dust settle.
After the fork you'll have bitcoins and bitcoins2x
Then use the most profitable coin.
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:20:08
why do I need an alternative?
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:39:21
so you've heard "lets see the price after the fork" so many times??
hahaha it has happened only once.
you have no idea what you're talking about.
Ive bought my first bitcoin in 2012 fyi
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:37:45

Lets see after the fork. Peace

I use this strategy:
A lot of coins go up and down, but they have a baseline.
For example, OmiseGo, for most of its time was traded at $9-$10.
It goes 9.5, 9.8, 10.5 etc. It stays in the $10 territory.
So when the price fell to $7 this week, I bought them. Because the fall was temporary, caused by the BTC fork. I was pretty sure it would go back up again. And it did. It went to $9 again and now its $8.5. I could sell to profit $1.5 per OMG I own or I can wait.
Bottom line is this. Follow 5-10 coins for a week or two and see where they trade. Also see what the ATH was, because most coins can get to that price again. When the price falls below the "average" price, buy some. The price will get up again tomorrow. Not by much probably, but by 0.5% or 1%. Then it'll fall down again.
Now its up to you how much you want to earn. If 1% is enough, you can find a lot of coins. If you want more  you have to follow their social media, read news about the coins and anticipate events.
For example, when a coin is listed in any exchange, its price will skyrocket because the volume skyrockets. You buy that coin before it's listed and sell after the price skyrockets.

So how come you've heard this SOO many times over the years?
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:23:27

Ill trade you my 250 AWESOMEBTCS (thats what I call them) with your 250 BTC2x. Deal?
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:57:36
And why would I want to buy something that's banned?
Besides, people are not banned to meet face to face but you still cant sell cocaine to people.
It'll be the same. As if you have kilos of cocaine in your house worth millions.
How are you gonna sell it?

Since no one owns the name bitcoin, they can name it whatever they want.
I know who owns r/btc. I dont care.
I just want my coins to have maximum value, whether its BTC, BCC, BGOLD, B2X.
I dont fucking care bout politics. 
Dont you realize that we're fighting with each other while whales like thymos or eric or other big players have millions and just want more millions?

a lot of alts are being used in real life right now.
People in Taiwan can buy at McDonalds with OmiseGO
You can rent your harddisk size for Filecoin.
Bitcoin gains seem like a lot because the price is high, but in terms of percentage is not. There are many alts which have gained more than bitcoin.
To put it simply:
You could buy 1 BTC at $4000 or 100000 Xcoin at $0.04
The price of BTC is now $5000 so you won $1000.
But the price of Xcoin is now $0.08 so you won $4000.
You can see how for traders is more profitable to bet on altcoins. Because many, many coins go from $0.0001 to $0.0002, a 50% gain.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:43:34
not all altcoins are currencies
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:48:28

Chance of it going to 9k is a lot lower than it going to 2k imho.

I believe that it will win, IF it happens.
If it doesnt, you get 250 btc and Ill get nothing? haha seems like a fair trade.
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:59:42
