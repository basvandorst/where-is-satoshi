I Don't know if I would call it great. I certainly is an interesting topic of study. I just saw a lot of the discussion revolving around how excellent the question was fielded and wanted to provide a little insight into who was asking it. Having explored Senator Toomey's contributors (or the inside term obligations) it seems unfair to alternate financial markets that he can wield so much power in legislation regarding the finance industry when he takes in more money from big banks than he does from his own constituency. It worries me that he then has a bias favoring the banks and a biased against non-banking interests( I.e. regular people not employed by a bank) Obviously he is not the only person on the committee to do so, and I am not holding him personally responsible for the system we have. But; he is the supporting focus of the video and i figured, since less than 20% of his constituency can name him (Congress reconsidered, revised 2017) and probably fewer here know who he is but I could maybe shed a little light on him to anyone digging this deep into the comments. 
Thanks for the reply!

For anyone who doesnt know that Pat Toomey republican senator from Pennsylvania(elected 2016) He recieved almost a third (9,627,263) of all the money he raised for his electipn campaign from the finance industry. All bank and traditional money management companies. Additionally, commercial banks were his top 8th industry of contribution. PNC, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and JP Morgan were all top 20 contributors to Pat Toomey. 
If you want crypto to stop being influenced by commercial banks it is important to know who is funding the people who hold the seats on the powerful regulatory committees.
