Assuming your logic is correct. Let's look at it from another example. Old Granny in her retirement from corporate ladder decided to invest in an apple farm. She rented a huge piece of land, bought some tractors and farming equipments to start growing her apple farm. Those were her initial cost. She also needs to pay  ongoing wages to her workers and daily expenses to run her business. Soon 'Granny Smith' apples were famous and people's love of  apples meant they were sold for $20000 a ton to retailers. However one day people no longer love apples and instead like oranges. Price of her prized apples plummeted to $6500 a ton and she is now breaking even in cost/profit. She turned to Reddit for a solution to her problem. She came across someone saying that in bitcoin, if U increase the hashrate you increase the demand. A light bulb moment illuminated on granny's head and turned her white hair temporarily yellow. She will do the same with her apples. She hires more workers and rent more land. Has demand created. Only in granny's mind maybe, but at the farm market next month, the only thing that has changed is that Granny has more apples to sell.

Chart not relevant anymore as it went down again. So classic reverse reverse Bart pattern - bearish

When miners find blocks of Bitcoin. The available supply is increased I mean. Miners is just a bussiness. Like all business they have expenses n need to pay them. Electricity companies don't accept Bitcoin, landlords also don't accept rent payment in bitcoin. They need to cash out their Bitcoin eventually once their flow of cash goes down. They have to sell.

The effort you put in to mine bitcoin is not demand. A miner would do cost-benefit analysis of mining bitcoin. If he perceive it is profitable, they will mine it now. They will also mine it if they 'perceive' it will profitable in the future even if it is a loss now. This is again speculative like people buying bitcoin hoping to the moon. What you probably trying to say is that hashrate is correlated to "more (speculative) interest" in bitcoin because people putting in so called 'effort'.  Sometimes people get it wrong and their effort and 'perceived demand' doesnt actually reflect actual demand
@_date: 2018-09-08 08:07:08
Except people like to gamble and speculate. They hoping Bitcoin goes to the moon!! Or someone didn't do the maths right. It's a big world out there and who knows.
@_date: 2018-09-08 00:04:07
Well miners just mine bitcoin then sell them later on to cover expenses like electricity. This creates selling pressure on exchanges. They create supply not demand because they will NEVER buy bitcoin but only sell them. Demand is like from people buying bitcoin to buy stuff / speculate.

That kind of thinking is exactly what led to Bitcoin to $20,000 and back to $6200. People buying to gamble and make quick bucks instead of seeing its very little real-world applications. People will always point out a cafe that accepts bitcoin but failed to point out the other 1,000,0000 cafe that doesn't. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 02:05:05
Yeh it will take a long time to reach back towards $7000-8000 once it drops
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:26:43
Nobody is convincing people of panic selling. People are referring to the huge downward triangle in the monthly charts. And yes technical analysis theories says if it breaks that massive support it will be hard and fast down to 5k/4k prices and that 6k support will become a massive resistance. You decide yourselves if u want to gamble or not
@_date: 2019-11-25 08:45:00
Was thinking of buying it when around $7000, lucky I didn't. :)
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:31:36
if it breaks below $6k, its going to be a big drop. Are you sure you want to gamble your money like this?
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:03:42
maybe history wont repeat because circumstances have changed since 2013, etc short selling more prominent, bitcoin futures etc
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:57:50
... and people who listened to all these 'buy dip' advice since beginning of this year would have lost a lot of money
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:49:09
volume exploding when it goes down is usally a bad sign.
What you want instead is volume exploding during the recovery/rally phase.
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:40:05
hahahah so true
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:31:02
blockchain and bitcoin are seperate things
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:36:57
This is not 2015. Bitcoin got alot of exposure since and have lots of regulation involvements, bans from China etc. Bitcoin futures. Alot more options to short and keep prices down
@_date: 2018-11-19 08:59:52
That's a lot of assumptions and alot of risk involved with very little proven benfit. Have you ever thought that instead of your complicated conspiracy theory that there is a very simple and feasible explanation to the current downturn in price: that its price is dictated by supply and demand, and that right now not many people is demanding Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-17 03:27:36
Dead cat bounce?? Is this a good time to short Bitcoin???
@_date: 2018-11-24 03:04:45
Thanks for writing. Very insightful article u got.
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:25:57
I think he is joking or teasing U :(
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:52:18
It's not very fair to compare Bitcoin to stockmarket. It's worse than comparing it to gold or currency. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:13:45
I said the same thing when it rebounded to 5600 about 4 hours ago. And look at where it is now. &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2018-11-17 03:26:11
Why does he even bother to make predictions when he is clearly bullish bias and always always wrong. Why all these articles also never states Disclaimer: Tom Lee is bullish and just trying to trick U to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-17 03:26:56
Great job in your prediction
@_date: 2018-11-23 01:27:23
Last chance to sell before 3k
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:40:21
You in denial if you think a price drop from 6.2k to 3.8k is caused by Bitcoin cash which by the way has nothing to do with bitcoin. You remembered when Bitcoin got forked to Bitcoin cash. The price didn't go down did it ?? (it went up instead)
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:24:55
Bitcoin a currency? Everything U can buy from stores are really quoted in USD price or other Fiat's then converted into Bitcoin amount. It's more of a form of payment then currency. When coffee shop start selling coffee for 0.001 btc and next year if I can buy that same coffee from same store for same amount more or less then I would consider a currency. But as we know this isn't happening now because if it does either the store will go broke or the customer gets ripped off. (From the huge changes in value of btc)
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:41:31
Nice video thanks for sharing
@_date: 2018-11-17 03:18:50
It could also mean that people are trading Bitcoin more. I.e Bitcoin becoming a financial instrument for speculation. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 03:21:02
Bitcoin hash rate showed stagnation in latest 4-5 months and is looking at trending lower for first time. Look at Bitcoininfo.com
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:06:39
Actually there were lots of TA talking about the triangle and breakout of the triangle past 6k .....which is what happened. 
You probably didn't take notice of it because of what psychologist called confirmation bias. If we are bullish in Bitcoin we seek out faintest evidence that support our bias (that Bitcoin goes to moon) and reject even super strong evidence that is not in accordance with our belief (bear market not ended yet) . Eg, Look at Tom Lee and Dr Macaffe, they won't listen to any reason, still thinking Bitcoin will be $15k by end of year (40+ days to go)

Umm I did say cold wallet can get stolen and caught of fire. As in some thief literally take your hardware wallet in your safe. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 04:48:31
They are ATM machine with large spreads to buy and sell bitcoin. The large spreads allows the investor of the Bitcoin machine to make money. Think of it as exchanging foreign money at airport . Just don't do it unless U really have to. U are better off selling &amp; buying it at big exchanges which have relatively small spreads. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 04:44:02
He's not telling U to buy gold but pointing out the important difference between gold and bitcoin. Gold = has established use in society. Bitcoin = little value except people buying it to speculate then sell at high price. It's up to U what U want to buy. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 06:33:21
Bitcoin all hype and doesn't deliver. That's why price drops. People who invested this year and lost won't reenter again. Bitcoin will probably die a very slow death. Better put your money into traditional markets like stocks or properties
@_date: 2018-12-25 06:44:19
Stocks still pays dividends in crash. Bitcoin doesn't. Stocks are still lower risk than Bitcoin because at the moment we still don't know if Bitcoin will ever recover. Meanwhile I know if some company is still profitable (like FANG). It will probably still stick around for long time.
@_date: 2018-12-27 04:06:34
Gold in addition to be a storage of value it is also a commodity. Which means it is consumed. It is bought in bulk for the electronics industry and jewellery store. There will always be demand for gold as long as electronics survives and people like wearing fancy stuff.
Bitcoin on the other hand. Yes U can buy it to store value but look how that went this year. U can buy it to act as payment (by the way 99% of people never spend it on shops but instead speculate and hodl). But demand for it to be used as payment is not there. There are no exclusivity case where it has to be Bitcoin, but instead your standard visa/MasterCard does it well already.
@_date: 2018-12-27 04:55:22
I agree. Money kept in bank is way more secure than a Bitcoin wallet that can get hacked. Password forgotten, cold wallet stolen or caught in fire. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 03:27:09
Problem is in long term U don't know whether this is a dip or the midpoint to $0
@_date: 2018-12-25 03:23:50
Depends where U live. I think they ban it in USA. I won't recommend using credit card though. You need to make gains more than the credit card interest. My country credit card interest is like 18% per annum
@_date: 2018-12-25 03:21:54
Dead cat bounce always. Good shorting opportunities again
