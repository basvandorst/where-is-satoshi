who said it was supposed to go anywhere?

You mean resistance on the way back up

you should learn the difference between lose and loose

'The problem is not buying a lot anyway, it's panic selling when it drops then losing money.'
This is only true if the price always goes up over time which may not be true.

Why would it though? A few years ago the idea of bitcoin seemed really cool. You could actually use it to buy things. Now it costs $20 to buy a sandwich and takes hours to verify a transaction so it's not becoming a better currency.
The truth is everyone is buying BECAUSE of the price rise. It's a classic bubble IMO.

Fuck wall street says the guys who are trying to get rich quick buying the next big thing. You are literally doing exactly what wall street does.

probably shouldn't take investment advice from someone who can't spell 'selling'

adoption is higher now than ever and the ease of transactions isn't getting better it's getting worse. People are buying to get rich quick.

You could say the same about countless stocks or investments that are now dog shit. It's naive to just buy any price of bitcoin and assume if you wait long enough you'll make money.

I dno man, I think volatility is a problem. If you were to actually use bitcoin as a currency you'd get paid in bitcoin and the value of your wage would fluctuate so much that you'd never know if you could make rent or not. Or prices of goods would move so much that simply buying a car is a gamble on the direction of the currency.

I know but the idea that a country holds 3b worth of bitcoin could 'make them be among the richest' is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:59:24
High volatility and the fees can be very high according to steam.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:06:12
You think a country can become rich by buying 3b of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-20 07:07:01
Do you really think that's going to happen?
@_date: 2014-11-01 03:31:33
So it's the governments fault?
@_date: 2014-10-07 10:00:35
For everyday use? Not very, IMO.

At the time when bitcoins were at 1000 this sub was a complete mania, every top post was we're going to 10k and to the moon!! 
It doesn't surprise me that a few people bought into the hysteria. Anyone who was advising caution was down voted into oblivion.
