Where's Bitcoin Core at? :)

Domain was reserved with that in intent but was repurposed for bitcoin exchange.

He actually typed "blockchain" into address bar but this is what happens when you use search engine Trojan instead of a proper browser. Dude got scroogled twice in two clicks ... and Google got paid for it. So, Google knows who stole those bitcoins.

*shush* That's secret :)

I'm just in the middle of giving several of my coworkers $15 in Bitcoin each. Spread the virus :)

Just to clarify, you didn't loose BTC, you lost fiat.

Serbia - 40% income tax, 18% sales tax, 10% import tax. You get around 42% of your work, you gotta pay for private healthcare if you want to see the doctor this year and every public service is as crap as it can be.

Miner's interests are not necessarily the same as Bitcoin users'. Allowing miners to control BTC would lead to unlimited BTC supply and devaluation of user's coins. 
Miners can't really leave, they do have equipment that generates wast sums of BTC if mining and collects dusts if not. Leaving is throwing away money and network would adjust by lowering difficulty. So, BTC wouldn't really be affected.

Clog BCH blockchain? :D
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:08:52
Guys, I have a technical question. How hard would it be to create a really large transaction, like, 7.5MB big? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:53:35
Let's try that. Lets say 50% of BTC miners go to BCH. Until those prices change, miners that switched will earn 5-10x less then those that stayed on BTC, according to my calculations (5x before BTC diff adjustment and 10x after). So, BCH/BTC value needs to rise 10x to stop those miners from burning money. Is it gonna go up 10x times? Realistically, no. Otherwise, miners would already have their bitcoin chains where they can mine 10 or 100x more than this a day if hash rate affected price in significant manner. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:04:07
Well, it could be the lowest it's ever gonna be and it's definitely better buy than before the dip. So, why would any of us oppose people buying more BTC? Are you one of shills? :D 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:39:56
Value generated by mining per day (excluding tx fees as they make calc harder), I believe BTC and BCH generate same amount of coins per day, so price(BCH)/price(BTC) = 0.117 = 11.7% ATM
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:04:13
What other chain? BCH can sustain 1/10 of BTC miners, assuming they don't plan to throw away money. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:05:24
It's more of an attack on their hard drives than transactions. Just storing 8MB blocks would be over 400GB per year. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:41:30
Sure, it would be invalid on BTC network, but BCH just might process it. I was wondering how much effort and fees would it take to achieve big blocker's dreams and make all BCH blocks 7-8MB. Which would take &gt;400GB/year to store, which would show why we don't want huge blocks. Apparently, the min fees are set by nodes so there is no clear answer to min fees for such transactions.

Combination of keylogger, bad antivirus, not-so-good wallet and panic from me. Got phishing email, apparently from Google, fake login site was hosted on Google drive, I didn't login but somehow clicked on browser's pop-up that installed some software ( malware with keylogger). Some great features right there from Google and Mozilla.
Day after that, it activated, started logging in to BTC-e and similar sites, I had 2FA so it didn't do much there but I remembered using my wallet to send a transaction last night and I panicked. Started Windows defender scan, it found something, I assumed it was neutralized, and in fear of my wallet being compromised I created new wallet and moved funds there to see it being cleared immediately. AV did not neutralize malware, it waited for full scan to complete before even thinking about it. Face-palm. I used multibit, it may have saved new wallet unencrypted before me entering password, though I'm not sure. Keylogger was involved so wallet was defenseless.

Looks like they sold some coins to get fiat, that could have caused price drop in last few days (additional to china)
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:29:23
4300$/BTC, are they on to something? :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:46:40
A bit. Until yesterday, better AV and a anti-keylogger, now I'm on Ledger Nano S. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:47:54
I had 5 BTC stolen by malware few years ago, any way to trace coins to exchange or something?

I came recently too, after some year or two. I also have around 10 BTC on Mt Gox :D 
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:35:19
Hmm, this looks familiar...
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:09:24
IMO, quite high. If wallets were seized, there would be a race to empty those, both US and rest of BTC-e would try to get coins from those ASAP. 
Assuming US seized wallets, we can safely assume BTC-e had backup of hot/cold wallets somewhere and unless US arrested **everybody** that could have access to that, US would try to empty those ASAP. BTC-e would try the same if it suspected US had access to wallets. Lack of coin movement indicate that US has no access to wallets.

I'm assuming people are buying BTC to get some BCH/BCC to dump on Aug 1. Also, maybe UASF activating tomorrow has some part in it.

That's an altcoin, I was referring to Bitcoin network.
