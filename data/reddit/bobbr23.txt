Exactly, many people who did buy at these prices have probably lost at least some of them over the years.

I Hate Trump. But if he has a hand in catalyzing crypto ubiquity, he'll be remembered as the greatest president in history... Of course I'm talking millennia from know when everyone has forgotten about what a stupid fucking asshole he is, but that indeed would be an astronomical contribution to man kind.

This sounds like good news. The article seems to favor blockchain tech.

Should've bought ethereum instead

I think she/he is referring to the notion of disruption and how incumbents are often blind to the fact that they are being disrupted. Ethereum is an example of a disrupter that has a very good shot of playing spoiler to Bitcoin. They are delivering on the promise of blockchain with network effect via a network of networks, smart contracts, forthcoming PoS, Ethereum Name Service, IPFS, fast and cheap confirmations, etc. If you think BTC's competitive advantage is time you are sorely mistaken.
That said I am a Bitcoin HODLr and hope it goes moon. But I implore fellow believers to diversify their portfolios and bet on a world powered by blockchains, not just a specific one.

Great idea for a thesis. I submitted my answers, good luck. One bit of feedback though, don't simply assume that the ONLY use case for Bitcoin is as a currency. Understand that the blockchain is the true magic and that once you grasp the opportunities surrounding a global, immutable, decentralized brain, you understand why Bitcoin is Internet 3.0

‘Mnuchin said it's interesting that, in a increasingly digital world, "the demand for U.S. currency continues to go up."’
...that is “interesting”. Almost non-sensical in fact. Hmmmmmm.

“I have nothing to do with bitcoin. I never worked for the company, I don't know any people there, I never had a contract there or anything like that. I wasn't even aware of the product,” he said.
...  but does that mean he was aware of “the company”? An easy mixup for anyone if he had heard Hal (and whomever else involved) talking about something called “Bitcoin” - he thought it was their company. If that’s the case then there’s zero doubt that Hal is Satoshi.

Companies want branded tokens. That alone is a use case.

Best Reddit comment I've seen in a while! Lmao

Seems to me we are still in the awareness phase. Public mania had not yet hit crypto, not by a long shot. Hell, financial media outlets are just now starting to cover it. When mania phase does happen, holy cow, it's going to crazy.

I hope you're interpretation is more accurate than mine, I happy with a mid 100s mean after capitulation.

Or halve in value, that's a big introduction of risk
