It's already being used to park black money.
In many countries you are able to buy btc in cash. In the recent event of demonitisation in India ppl having access cash money i.e black money which is not taxed bought btc in bulk @ price of 3000$. Majority of these guys are money launders. This is just one case. Mafias have also been active in the btc market. Some of the whales in the market are not investors (normal ppl ) but have earned money in a wrong way and are now just parking it in he form of btc. We might think that btc  is decentralized and no one controls it but actually anyone with a major chunk can regulate the price better saying operate the price of btc in he market. All politicians and executives of big companies may on media react against btc but these are the first to buy them and park their money. BTC is like a better version of Swiss bank coz it holds your money without the maintenance costs. And if the price of btc falls or rises these guys don't care coz anyways they wouldn't be allowed to move their money into the system coz it's not legally earned and not taxed. So buy converting them in btc they able to bring them back into the system .
