It should totally be of their own consent. Probably should also have lots of practice and preparation before coming out. I'm just saying if Satoshi truly wants Bitcoin to succeed this could help a lot.
EDIT: So many down votes... I just thought it was an interesting idea to explore.

While I understand that view and would love for it to be possible, we have to also accept how the world works. Bitcoin would have an easier time being adopted if someone could take up the role of public figure. The public would definitely respond to a story like Satoshi's.

I agree it would be dangerous and take a huge sacrifice from Satoshi. But it could still be really good for the adoption of Bitcoin worldwide to have someone like that. Maybe Satoshi is waiting for the right moment. Someone could make a lot of money if they knew when Satoshi was going to emerge.

There could be a tipping point. We don't know since we have never reached it.

Here's what I imagine a more realistic future would be with digital currencies. Countries/states/cities will create their own currencies so that they can more easily spend locally and have some control for various economic needs. Bitcoin will be the global currency that all of these smaller currencies can trade into for use globally. I imagine these groups will back their own currencies with bitcoin but who knows. This is good because it lets global trade work in a more free market way, while allowing local governments the control they need for various social programs, public projects, taxation, etc.

To be fair, the guy said it after he was declared guilty. So he really was only a hero once that happened, making it the perfect time to shout that.

It isn't Bitcoin's problem, it's CS in general. But we can try to help.
Edit: I can't believe people are against helping make the CS/engineering world more inclusive... The environments can be so toxic sometimes, the least we could all do is try and help. ): If anyone is interested, consider checking out [girlswhocode.com]( and volunteering.

Women *could* be as interested in software engineering and cryptography as men, it's not like it's genetic.

Only their access point would need to be on which would be on all the time anyways.

[This is probably what you want.]( I plan on doing the paper wallet and possibly the "making a secure workspace."

Namecoin? PPCoin? Just trying to say it might be good to keep your mind open to more than one [crypto-currency](

Apple doesn't let people buy anything (EDIT: digital goods) in any app, unless it goes through in-app purchases.
