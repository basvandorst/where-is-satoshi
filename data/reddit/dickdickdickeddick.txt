Even Apple needed startup cash. Now they get what they want from everyone.
Also, we already have shops that accept bitcoin. All you need is an employer that will pay you in bitcoin and the circle closes.

Yeah, it would totally suck if a business accepted (every form of credit handled by many companies), cash, PayPal, check, AND Bitcoin.

Do those places employee people that they could pay with bitcoin? Same circle as before with a different name.

He has several good points on how to deal with yourself and general human to human interaction. His points on long form communication are fantastic, especially on how to convey what you actually are trying to when it comes to productive debate.
However, he's far from perfect. Listen to him speak on religion for awhile. Any time he speaks where his points can be contested by someone with actual skill in debate, paired with intelligence to back it up, and he basically falls apart trying to talk. He has some pretty insane ideas that you can tell he deeply believes.
Granted religion has nothing to do with Bitcoin, but he isn't your friend anymore than he is mine. And lately he's even said in round about ways that he's after money while the getting is good. And I fear a potential new money system driven by someone who knows humans at a core level far more than someone who was born into daddy's company.
I don't need Google grade machine learning lead by incredibly smart people after my money. Because they will get it in the end.
