Alright, I'm guessing the private keys aren't what I used to decrypt my wallet when I wanted to spend something right? if i had the resources where would I find those??
edit: what a fucking way to spend my cakeday QQ

Thanks, I guess. My only regret is the time I spent accumulating them is now wasted, unlike you who have spent this time helping me and probably others. You probably deserve them more than me D:

Before I dbaned where were the keys? Thank you btw

I really should have. I may have backed up the wallet on my flashdrive but I format that thing regularly. The only thing close to a wallet was crypto exchange, the rest was offline.

I don't think I backed anything up, it wasn't the password I memorized right?

The irony in this is I am using a hybrid SSD/HDD setup and had /Users/ and /Program Files/ and /Program Files 986x)/ on drive X:, the HDD I used to dban when I was setting up the hybrid system and had to start over. Dban failed to work 3 times and because my parents are divorced I had an entire night to think it over with no contact with the computer for the greater part of a day. In the 4 days I could have saved the wallet all I did is work on getting dban to work and now the $500 is gone. It turns out I'll be mowing lawns for cash after all DX

oof, okay when I get back to the other house I'm definitely doing that. thanks a lot btw.

yeah I think using dd to put an ISO on the flashdrive pretty much overwrites everything completely but I'll check that out. thank you so much for the help.

You could do that with one rpi tho...

Ahh, thank you for explaining all of my questions in such a short answer. That explains all of this goddamn syncing, too!
