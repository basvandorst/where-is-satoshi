If people know the pattern why do they buy in so high? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:39:12
Bitcoin is up $600 for the week.
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:20:22
Lol . Did you miss the dip? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:34:41
Still waiting for a dip. :) . I'm back in the game. It's like stealing money from weak hands. So much easier than day trading.
@_date: 2017-09-06 22:40:00
Nope . If it's on anything but a cold storage it's not your Bitcoin.

Wait for a drop. This happens all the time . New investors come in when Bitcoin goes up ask if they should buy, buy, and then panic at the drop. Just wait for a drop and buy in when you feel comfortable.

People laugh about him but it was those early adopters that got us to where we are now. And Silk Road.

I'm sure last month it hit a low of $2900 after falling from $4700. Shoulda got in ����‍♂️����‍♂️����‍♂️

Why do people want to invest in BITCOIN on the way up? It was at 1800 last week!!!!! Buy the dip . 
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:03:36
Massive crash to 2500? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:10:33
It doesn't work that way.
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:48:58
You'll probably want to not wake up if Bitcoin ever hits 10k.
@_date: 2017-06-05 04:23:36
