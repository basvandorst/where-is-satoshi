She's not an economist.
She may work in economics. (She is director of Policy Research in Macroeconomics  at a university, according to Wiki) But she does not understand basic economic concepts. Look up [Money supply]( on wikipedia, and in &lt;1 hour you will know more than her about economics.
She is an example of why people think economics is a sham. She calls herself an economist and says obviously false things. It's a serious and important science, which people aren't able to connect with, because the public face of economics is people like this.

that's an impressive lack of understanding of economics. an educated person might have said "when the amount of money available is fixed, and the economy grows, that causes inflation". not "...it doesn't work".
I hear a lot of intelligent people confusing a "pump and dump" with a "ponzi scheme" or a "pyramid scheme". They are all very different, unrelated types of scam. To wikipedia, everyone!

Sounds like chinese whispers.

There are forms of protest that really work. The textbook on changing despotic regimes is "from dictatorship to democracy". It's available online free.
Just because your state is bad (corrupt or opressive or whatever), doesn't mean anarchism is the only answer. A real democracy is probably a better solution to fight for.
But yes, nice digestable explanation of how powerful people aren't evil, just rational. More people should read this.

"from dictatorship to democracy" has some good ideas about that. the usual ways people protest at government are useless, but there are a few ways the masses really can force changes. well worth a read.

Is it legally possible for a business to refuse to trade with a person for arbitrary reasons? I know nothing about Australia, but it's a safe bet that the law is similar to the UK, and the USA, each of which had their famous bakery scandals (partly) over this question.
I bet the banks are open to prosecution for refusing to do business with someone for no good reason.
Edit: a quick search says that this is called "refusal to deal". A USA website says




And wikipedia says that this concept also applies in Australia. So I've convinced myself anyway.

Thanks i didnt know that. I still understand very little of it TBH.
It says "Using ... some very advanced scripting, it becomes possible to build a multi-party lottery". Could it be that simple contracts are easy, but to make complicated types of assets with lots of rules, it might turn out to be difficult or impossible to implement using bitcoin? So either, this "chain" technology will only be used for some types of asset trading, or else the bitcoin script could be revised to allow more flexibility?

"Policy rules about the movement of assets can be enforced programmatically ". Is this possible using bitcoin? It sounds like it would need to be based on ethereum for that functionality.

I've been having the same confusion, but I think I've figured it out now:
Steem is a crypto version of reddit. It's more annoyingly misspelt, but free of ads and political manipulation (due to blockchain mathamagic). You can read for free, but you must pay a subscription to comment/vote/post. You can earn money back for writing popular posts (and other stuff). So effectively, your subscription fee goes to the creators of the best content.
It will probably fail. It's an unprecedented concept though that could be revolutionary, or could inspire something revolutionary.
