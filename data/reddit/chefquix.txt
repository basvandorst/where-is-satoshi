My favourite thinig in the world is buying humble bundles with btc.

One of my favourite things right now is buying the humble indie bundle with bitcoin.  In all honesty doing online transactions with btc just makes me so happy that I don't have to enter my credit card details with yet another ecommerce site, hoping they've invested enough in security that it doesn't get stolen.

I think what will drive the price up is more central bank shenanigans like Cyprus. Cyprus was the canary in the coal mine, and when similar things happen in countries that are teetering like Venezuela or Argentina, having a currency that your government can't confiscate will prove to be irresistible to the everyday citizen.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, Bitcoin is the people's currency, and that's where it gets it's strength.

I would love to see CCP ( accept BTC for plesk.  Or blizzard, I would play WoW again if I could pay with BTC.

Really, I had no idea.  I thought the whole point was to be able to transparently see every transaction?  So mt. gox doesn't actually exchange btc when people make trades?  Interesting, that's a lot of faith in an institution.

*smacks head, duh..

Right, you're correct, they're kWh, not per hour.  But I'm sure the comment meant that, and not kW/hr.

I wonder if someone is finally using bitcoins to circumvent the $3000 limit for gambling in macau.  
@_date: 2012-05-28 15:19:34
Well that's just through an exchange, right?  There are other ways to trade BTC.
@_date: 2012-03-10 22:39:55
That's the exact same with social network circa 2003.

Crypto-currency.  It's awesome.

I'm in Winnipeg and mine is .06/kWh.  I tested my rig out with with a kill-a-watt and it was about 600 watts for about 850 Mhashes.. so yeah, maybe his number seems a bit off as I get about .5/day.  Hmmm

Rate for electricity are generally priced in kw/h.  Seems like a rational unit of measurement to me...

Canadian.  Hydro is crazy cheap in winnipeg - probably the best place to start a btc farm.  Cheap hydro, cold winters (help with cooling?).
@_date: 2012-12-17 07:55:39
I still mine, but I'm lucky because I pay $.06/kwh.  Even if it was more I'd still be likely to keep mining because of future value.

Two 6970's, on my gaming rig.  I use phoenix although I wasn't when I ran the test.  Why, what are you getting?
@_date: 2012-05-28 15:19:04
I can't find the article anymore, but the gist of it was that mainlanders were prevented from bringing more than $3,000 to macau.  
@_date: 2012-11-20 19:16:47
Thanks, that's the answer I was looking for.  Hypotheticals aside, this is the upper limit as the network currently stands. 
@_date: 2011-06-08 18:47:23
I'd be very interested in seeing if there's a jump in their stock value this quarter.  Every store I went to on sunday was out of 6990s...
@_date: 2011-06-22 20:04:50
Yeah, I'm currently on that system but I'm surprised that they're taking so long to re-open the deposits.  On one hand, I'm hoping that they're beefing up their security and doing things right.  On the other hand, the exchange will tend down towards zero as the amount of CAD currency in the system dries up.

It's a dummy vga - see 
Very easy to make, just need 3 resistors.  Usually your video card with come with the vga - dvi converter.  When you have more than one video card in windows and they're not in crossfire, you'll need to plug them into the second (or third) card in order to get them to work.  The only annoying part is that you're left with a 'ghost' blank spot on the side of your screen (or wherever you position the ghost monitor).

I have two 6970s and they put out about 370-380 each.

yeah, that's along the lines that I was thinking - assuming that kevin is speaking the truth, and it's sort of why I believe him over the MtGox people.  If he really was the hacker, then surely he would have known that there were withdrawal limits and would have adjusted accordingly.  In fact, if you go a bit deeper, all they would really need to do is look at which accounts had setup buy orders at 0.01 to see who the real criminal was.  But of course that information is inside their system and goes against the narrative they're pushing, so I doubt you would see them release that information.
@_date: 2011-06-21 14:18:57
I would start there and investigate, yes, much like they're investigating Kevin.  Presumably, it might be intelligent to see whom put in .01 orders shortly before the big sell, no?

You would not be able to mine 1000 btc / day with 100,000 worth of standard hardware.  Probably more on the order of 100, at most.  So with the exchange the way it is now, you're looking at 200 - 300 / per day, which would pay off your equipment in a year, not including electrical costs.  Depending on where you are, electricity could eat up your entire revenue based on the current difficulty versus exchange rate.  You might be better served to just buy a bunch of btc if you think they'll go up in value.

As someone in another thread pointed out, if it was only worth a penny, it's not valuable if you wish to make a transaction over $210,000.

If you're going to try to market your exchange, why aren't you eating your dogfood?  I see 3 trades, shouldn't you at least pretend there's some volume by having your and your developers use it?
@_date: 2013-02-26 06:44:18
He laughed when I suggested it.  
@_date: 2013-02-26 07:08:24
Yeah, too many steps :P
@_date: 2013-10-19 04:44:14
When I go to this site, and I click on orderbook, and I see 3 outrageous orders, I'm immediately going to leave the site.  What's the point for me as a trader?  I don't see any bitcoins to buy, and therefore I'm not going to sell my bitcoins here either.  If you put up some reasonable bids and asks, from your own stock (assuming you have some), you might be able to jump start your exchange.  just my 2 mbtc. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 00:44:11
100mbtc is ~10 bucks no?
@_date: 2013-08-15 00:49:01
Also I just thought it might be nice to remind people - the confluence of gamers and btc and all that..
@_date: 2013-03-18 15:59:24
That's nice and succinct! 
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:23:16
Aww yeah, bought me a raspberry Pi from adafruit.com.  I've been meaning to get one for a while now.
@_date: 2013-02-25 23:04:18
this looks promising.. has anyone had any luck with this service?
@_date: 2013-02-25 22:19:37
site is down for me.
@_date: 2013-02-25 22:18:45
I don't really want to inconvenience him - like I just want to be able to send him somewhere legit and pick up cash, or have cash deposited into his account.  
@_date: 2013-02-25 21:47:36
Well doesn't western union charge like 50 bucks or something?  That's a pretty hefty price for 300 bucks.
