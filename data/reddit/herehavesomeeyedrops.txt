sounds dangerous  how difficult is it to crack a key
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:40:09
how do I do that?
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:56:43
haha thanks for that man I appreciate it, almost need it
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:54:03
how did you make so many bitcoins? enough to buy a car?
please teach me I'm starving
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:39:52
rate me out of 10 though
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:29:41
wouldn't it be easy to hack the un-accessed, old, forgotten about wallets?
I'm sure before bitcoins blew up, people didn't care about 160 bit entropy codes cause there were hardly any bitcoin thieves

haha hey congrats with being old enough to retire and at the same time being able to keep up with all this stuff man you must be really smart
I'm 20 years old with almost no money to my name and I have no idea what's in store for me in the future.. I'm studying to be a graphic designer, I'm trying to be a rapper, I'm selling smoking gear to stoner buddies and I want a piece of some party hosting business
but man, I don't think I'll ever make enough to even buy a car, seriously man congrats
edit: if you've got any money advice, not necessarily bitcoin related, I would listen SO hard haha
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:39:52
man I can hardly feed myself, I'll be honest here, I'd have kept it
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:49:37
well I'm just planning to buy it like I would gold
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:49:12
hey man I don't know anything about bitcoins either can you give me a 101?
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:29:16
where do the latest asic get manufactured? I live in Hong Kong and there are a lot of electronic factories a city away in shenzhen and whatnot, I could probably talk to them about getting it quickly
if I can I'll let you in on it
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:41:45
man I was gonna buy it when it dipped to 600, now it's going back up.. are you sure it's really equivalent to beanie babies? I mean it's currency that you can use internationally, it's secure all that
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:31:04
I don't get it
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:32:28
oh we can have multiple wallets? I'm legit confused because I just started looking into bitcoins as an investment but dropping from 1200 to 600 really puts me off so this is all new and interesting to me
im genuinely asking cause I know nothing
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:09:31
then explain why it's taken snoop so long to fall off when almost all he raps about is weed? I mean sure he says some deep shit sometimes and teaches good lessons now, and he had some gangbangin criiip shit.. nevermind snoop is versatile
wiz tho?
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:56:49
sorry can you explain why price varies? If I use legal money
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:14:27
awh man sorry dude, it could probably be a ferrari today, I feel for you
but honestly though I could really use some advice
everyone says just buy it if I want to invest, mining isn't profitable but how does that even make SENSE?
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:35:58
you're right I'm 20
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:07:27
LOL okay okay, how much can you sell me bitcoins for? I can give you hkd in cash or via bank transfers or w/e 
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:59:26
how do I keep my bitcoins safe? if my hdd dies I go broke?
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:11:11
:/ that's a lot higher than what it's being sold for online
