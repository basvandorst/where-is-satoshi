I just saw a study that said when humans say they are 99% confident of an answer, they are wrong 40% of the time.  It is this pompous overconfidence that makes them think they understand financial markets well enough to prevent financial calamity by controlling a single interest rate knob.  Would a hyper-intelligent computer refuse to do anything in the realm of increasing human happiness because it realized it didn't have sufficient information to make a decision effecting 7 billion individual lives or would it be even more overconfident than humans are?  Unless hiding itself from general knowledge were necessary to achieve its goal, I doubt such a hyper-intelligence would be very subtle.

Dollar bills aren't made of paper.

If you invented a monetary system that had built-in inflation and you were perfectly clear how the inflation worked with potential users and people had the choice to use it or not then I don't see what is immoral about that.  The morality comes into play when either you are not told or lied to about the inflationary nature of the currency or if you are forced to use it.  Even if a currency were not inflationary and you were forced to use it then that would be immoral.  So, basically, you have no choice but to use dollars and that coercion is the morality problem.

Then can ban US-based exchanges from converting from dollars to btc.  They can ban US companies from paying people in bitcoins.  They can ban US companies from accepting bitcoins for payments.  The exchanges are few and centralized and therefore easy targets.  Paying people in bitcoins and accepting them as payment are nearly impossible to hide from public knowledge and therefore also easy targets.  Whatever is left doesn't seem enough to sustain bitcoin.
