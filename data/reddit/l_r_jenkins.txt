this makes the definition contextual, which is ridiculous. with this logic, gold is not fungible because it can be declared "guilty" in the same way.

There is no escaping the good money property of bitcoin. If the protocol survives, bitcoin the currency will be valuable. People need to just accept this, deal with it, and get over it.

Because the common users have the power to abandon bitcoin and switch to any number of altcoins that share their common interest - the same way a lot of us are abandoning the us dollar for bitcoin.

tax reporting is voluntary. that means the government doesnt tax you. you tell them how much you made, under penalty of perjury, and pay them a percentage of your income.
if you find $5 bill on the sidewalk, you "should" be reporting that as income and paying an income tax on it.
if you buy a bitcoin for $200 and buy $201 worth of something with it, you "should" be reporting a $1 gain and pay taxes on it. capital gains like that come in two flavors: short term, holding less than a year, and long term, holding longer than a year.

The last 5 months, the price has moved sideways. Pretty soon, your tired argument of 70+ weeks "price decline" will be comatose. Better start a new account and come up with another reason bitcoin will fail. I recommend against using terrorism, child pornography, and tulips as those have all been tried before and failed. Looking forward to the comedy gold you certainly will come up with buttcoiner. Good luck.

next time say "quick, give me your pocket change. quick quick quick." when he hands it to you, tell him to download this app from the play store. 30 seconds after it installs, send him bitcoin in the fair value of the pocket change. now say "try sending me that change when i'm 1000 miles away, except remember the bitcoins will aways travel the same speed p2p."
remind him he didn't have to sign up for anything (mycelium), ask anyone for permission for an account, or wait for any business to open for this to be successful.

I'd put that 10-20 pct in precious metals that you physically possess. If you really want to be in altcoins, then perhaps 1-2 pct in alts and the rest in PMs. But thats just me.

Block size and bandwidth are the current technical holdbacks, not hashrate. Hashrate is only used to throttle block generation to 10 minute periods of time (on average).

Bitcoin is not a fiat system being forced on anyone. If you think its a good idea, you participate if you want to. If you think its a bad idea, then you voluntarily leave it alone. Whatever you think, bitcoin is working as we all expected it could.
If you like, explain why you think its a bad idea and we'll use the history of bitcoin to show you how your wrong and it works perfectly well despite your misunderstanding of why it actually is working.

this is such a strong point. if a stocks value is based on its future earning potential, then the price of bitcoin's shares can be compared to the value it is expected to hold and forward in the world economy. brilliant!
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:04:27
good thing "intrinsic" value is an arbitrary fraction of something's entire value. it doesn't mean shit that 0% of bitcoin's value is intrinsic unless you have a realistic probability that its "other" value will go to zero. And since you fucktard buttcoiners have been calling zero on bitcoin since $4, my guess is there is no probability of that happening.

All credit cards settle in about 3 months for the merchant. At any time the processor can claw that money back for almost any reason.
6 confirmations per hour times 24 hours per day, times 30 days a month, times 3 months = 13,000 blocks pass by in that time. You only need 6 confirmations for a solid confidence the funds haven't been double spent against you.

Depending on the type of sale, there's recourse with bitcoin as well because you need to know customer details in a lot of retail situations. Also, zero confirmation transactions are perfectly acceptable for small transactions. (there is a cost to double spending, more than the cost of your average consumer purchase).

No. IP addresses are don't have any of the properties of good money except scarcity.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:34:20
10 minute confirmation times are about 1300 times faster than credit card settlements. I'd say that's good enough as is.

"bitcoin" not once.
@_date: 2015-04-09 06:19:40
Why not both. The technology is solid and due to the built in scarcity, if successfully adopted by the mainstream, it has the potential to be worth tens of thousands of dollars per bitcoin.
