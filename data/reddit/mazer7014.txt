Thinking about cancelling my weekend anniversary trip with my wife so we can pour the money into btc instead. 
"Don't worry honey. I'm sure it'll pay off in a couple years" right guys? Right?

The main features that sparked my enthusiasm years ago was the potential for international transactions with no intermediary bank or government. And Resistance to devaluation by the state.
Being able to easily buy a cup of coffee with btc is much less important to me.

Dollar cost averaging is probably the safest / smartest way to go.

If he's so good and buying and selling that he can guarantee a 6x return in 5 days, why isn't he already a billionaire? Why would he need anyone else's money to begin with? 
I can't understand how people are this gullible.

I wouldn't say I've sacrificed much really. I've just put my extra money (not a lot) into bitcoin instead of traditional investments over the years. So, maybe years down the road if BTC goes to zero then I would have sacrificed my 401k I guess. So far though, my btc gains have allowed me to pay off my student loans, put a down payment on a new car when my old one broke down, and a down payment on a house. So, I feel I've benefited way more so far than if I had been putting the same money into a 401k

You want to tax btc transactions to support advertising? Lol. 
People that have enough incentives already do advertise, namely exchanges, and btc enthusiasts.

Buying all the way down. Wish I had more disposable funds.

Definitely a suckers rally. After which, to the moon!

I think it's mostly the uninformed that keep their BTC on exchanges. And the uninformed won't know about proof of keys day. I don't think much is going to happen.

Never thought id says something like this....
"I can't wait to do my taxes"  so I can use my refund on all these cheap bictoins.

My brother and I first started learning about btc around $200. We were young and couldn't afford much. Just bought  small amounts over time. DCA. I think I bought most of mine around the 200-700 range. Over the years as the price progressed, I sold to pay off my student loans, then my car, and eventually a down payment on a house. I barely have any left at this point, but still buy small amounts every month. Even though the price has soared since then, I'm happy to have realized profits to make those few life changing milestones. BTC is the future of money.
