The government won't be obsolete so as long as Google doesn't open their own branch of military training and armed guards in addition to the fact that they build cars provide internet service and even some smaller sets of utilities and eventually they'll start harvesting Mako energy to fuel their reactors and then some dude will send a meteor to destroy the planet for some reason that probably has to do with an ancient alien.

I was thinking an mmo where the money is implanted in the game tobbe mined, theres a set amount, and inactivr players lose 1% cash per week to refeed. NPC Merchants hold what's sold or bought. Only difference is the 1% tax to keep money in the system but that cant work IRL

Only if were talking well played blackjack where the casino is lax on varying your bet and showing evidence that you are good at keeping counts, and if the deck penetration is good. Then bitcoin is comparatively garbage (and would be even if it goes to a million). But again, so would anything else be :)

I've learned that the best way for me to do small day trading is to do completely the opposite what I normally would do. Whenever I start to panic I just buy more and whenever I am riding the high I sell a little bit word send it to one of the other cryptos that are doing badly that day. For example I see that Bitcoin is doing well in the last few hours so I took a small amount and threw it into Litecoin and ether for some reason. The last time I did that Litecoin and either blew up. The last time I moved from them to bitcoin it blew up. I didn't do it because I thought it was a good idea I did it because I thought it was a stupid idea and for some reason it keeps working. From now on I'm going to be stupid

Hello the following is a list of reasons why you might want to invest in Bitcoin  because they are the reasons why I have . I trained my body to accept bitcoin in exchange for muscle mass because I want women to have sex with me. Also I'm hoping it can be used to buy sex as well in the future. Also I recently saw a Bitcoin ATMs and if an attractive woman went to see me using one of those ATMs she might think I'm futuristic and trending and want to have sex with me. Also I read in various books that women like men who invest in things and that might make them want to have sex with me. There are a lot more reasons why but to make a long story short I just want to say in conclusion a few reasons of a list why I want women to have sex with me.

Yep, you got your price locked in though so if it does soar high you still have that price. Good game friend.
