Maybe I misunderstood what you mean by "broken security model". 
I assumed you meant that it would be possible to do a double spending attack for example.
If that is the case, why hasn't some hacker done it already?
If that is not the case, what kind of attacks are possible on NXT?
@_date: 2015-08-06 08:05:22
Just curios, if the security model i broken and there's no cost to break consensus, how come no one has taken advantage of this in the 1.5 years of NXT history? 
There's money to be earned, that should be incentive enough.

They do a really good job providing mining equipment indeed!
I question their future valuation, say 2-3 years from now when (hopefully) bitcoin community has grown to be more than just computer geeks that love mining.
I just don't see one company keeping 8% of the entire currency's valuation in the long run.
edit: spelling

disclamer: I have nothing to do with the bitcoin operated pool table. I was just browsing for some info regarding raspberry pi, and happened to see this.

I believe that the creation of bitcoin is perfect in its timing.
Within a year or a few years I believe we will have a collapse in the dollar and other fiat currencies.
Bitcoin might get extra boost in usage when other currencies fail.

I also reacted on the "real money" statement.
Don't use that term when you are actually describing traditional fiat currency.
In my world, bitcoin is the real money, while the paper money is temporary until the rest of the world has understood what bitcoin really is.

I think this is very bullish for bitcoins compared to litecoin.
One of the big "drawbacks" with bitcoins is that it is possible to mine using FPGA and ASIC's, while for litecoin it is CPU/GPU all the way.
With this kind of hardware, anyone, even my parents can start mining, making mining more available to the "grand masse".

Hi,  
I still remember, a couple years back; All the hassle with codecs and movies I could not watch because some codec was missing or was misconfigured.  
Then came VLC, and since then my life has been perfect.  
I have a donation of 0.5 BTC waiting for you.  
Let me know when you accept bitcoin on your donation page, and it’s yours.

Interesting!  
Although I still don't understand where the colored coin data is stored. 




So, you use bitcoin blockchain, but still manages to put no extra data into the blockchain?
I don't get it, how do you store the data if it takes 0 space?

China has piled up HUGE amounts of USD the last 15 years.
Last couple years they have used those to buy more gold (and they don't export any gold, even though they are among biggest producers).
I don't think they are afraid of cryptocurrencies at all, after all, it is a way for them to get rid of the mountains of dollars lying around in their central bank basement.

I actually do exactly the same.
HD Encryption on (with ~20 letter password) on Ubuntu installation, used for bitcoin, and bitcoin only.
Back it up to 3 different USB's, stored on different locations.
I store BTC for my whole family + my own "savings account" here.
My regular day-to-day account I have on my normal windows machine (only keep a &lt; 5 BTC's here).

I sold mine the other day (bought @ 0.8 BTC, sold @ 2.2-2.4 range).
Short term they can go even higher, since they still are able to deliver high dividends.  
But long term I don't think they will be able to keep 8.5% of total BTC value as they currently do (2.4 x 400,000 / 11,180,000).  
There will be other successful companies that will compete, and friedcat is skilled, but he is no god. And with limited amount of bitcoins out there, their valuation will eventually go down.

Norwegians should ask the tax authorities in Norway to look @ Sweden &amp; Finland. We are pretty similar countries overall, but in Swe/Fin tax authorities decided that bitcoin is in fact a currency and thus has no VAT.

China CB has about 1000 tonnes gold in their reserves (USA has about 8000 tonnes).
China produce about 400 tonnes gold / year, almost all of it stays in the country.
China imports 500-600 tonnes gold / year.
In one year, the import/mining equals to entire China's CB holdings in gold.
China CB has (officially) not bought a single gold bar since 2009.
Conclusion:  
The Chinese people gains the equivalent of entire USA CB holdings in gold every 8:th year. And they gain the equivalent of their own country's CB gold holdings every year.   
Yep, that must be it, because we can always trust in the official numbers and statements from the China CB &amp; government.

I do understand the fundamental differences between ripple &amp; bitcoin.
And as a geek and libertarian there's no doubt in my mind that bitcoin is faaaar better than ripple.
But, isn't there a risk that Ripple might appeal to non-geeks, non-libertarians and most important of all, governments?
What if governments decide to ban bitcoin and embrace Ripple?
In the eye of a "normal person", Ripple &amp; Bitcoin are the same thing (digital currency). And if one is embraced by the government, and the other is banned, I think there's a risk of Ripple beeing the next big thing and bitcoin will be the currency for silky road and silky road only.
A lot of 'if:s and but:s, I know, but still, it is a likely scenario in my mind.
Or am I missing something?

In beginning Dr. Robin Teigland said that this seminar was fully signed up within 5 days. Fastest signed up seminar in the history of the school, indicating a high interest of what bitcoin is here in Sweden.
Some of the persons who are here:  
* Irma Rosenberg, former vice chairman of Sweden’s central bank, currently board member in the "swedish national debt office".  
* 3/4 of our "big national banks" have representatives here.  
* Swedish tax agency have a couple representatives here.  
* Saw several investment banks representatives.  
* Police (experts on money laundry)  
* Different parts of Swedish government involving finance.  
* Bunch of nerds ... like myself :)  
This should be interesting!

Sooo, ASICMINER is basically taking up almost 8% of entire bitcoin value right now? (880.000 / 11.200.000)
Unless they keep up the insanely good job and ALL other bitcoin companies fail (more or less), I don't see how the market can keep the value that high.
Am I missing something?
