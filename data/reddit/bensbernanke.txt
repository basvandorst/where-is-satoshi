It's not so much that you are stupid. It's that you are human, and you think linearly. Surely, someone may have reacted similarly to a suggestion a fixed 10,000 BTC spent on pizza would later be worth $1mm. 
Consider the growth of M3 during 2007; or compare total Federal Govt assistance to banks from 1800-2006 and 1800-2007; or market cap of Caracas/Zimbabwe stock exchanges. It's hard for the human mind to pre-conceive exponential, non-linear eventualities. It's easy for a human to imagine an ice cube on the floor, much harder to predict the shape of the imminent puddle. 
You are also tunneling by platonically categorizing Bitcoin and then narrowly defining it's competition and assuming that BTC's future market cap must be justified or taken from current capitalizations. But even keeping to your narrow and obfuscating non-reality based assumptions we could easily model a $44,000,000 BTC based entirely on collapsing capitalization of the total market capitalization of all currencies, transfer systems, value stores, legacy equities, shadow/traditional liabilities, and other encumbered assets.

The only thing I said about you personally, is that you aren't dumb. 
For such a thoroughly sarcastic and self-confident troll account, you certainly bring the weak-tot action when it comes to logic and discourse. 
Carry on pleb.

This guy is right. Bitcoins are hard to get and worthless. 
Sell all of them.

Mr. Dumb,
This will be a million dollar sub well before we hit 21,000,000 coins. 
How do you figure the "current total capitalization of the entire planet?" 
There's ~$60 trillion in American equities alone, not to mention the $17 trillion out there in US Treasuries. That's not even counting foreign and lower magnitude markets.

Buying bitcoin.

Assuming this was tonight, it would have amounted to 0.023 BTC... I'll speculate this $18 Subway meal will become **The Million Dollar Sub**. Much like the infamous Million Dollar Pizza, etc.
That is, the 200,000 Satoshis will be worth $1,000,000 and a whole BTC will be worth $44,000,000 USD. Your new price target.
