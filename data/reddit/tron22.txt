This sounds like a whole economy of centralization if we need a trusted third party company to be checking transactions in this way.

BS in CS concentrating in infosec 2018. (Saying this so you can level your explanation appropriately, usually you don't know whether your talking to bill gates or your grandma).
Does this REALLY solve the issue? I'm confused on a few aspects of this.
1 - Opening payment channels seems convoluted.  It's like mandatory gift cards in order to buy a coffee. What does the actual transaction look like? Where does the payment channel actually take place relative to the user? (frontend/backend) 
If users are having to set reserves for every transaction they want to make, this can get mighty confusing for people that are now getting used to credit card radio tap services. (I get that this may just be the jam in a peanut butter, jam, and banana sandwich, I'm just wondering how far up the set)
2 - Where does most of the scalability happen? Does this only reduce transactions on the blockchain for users that plan to have multiple transactions with another user or business? Say I open a payment channel with another user but plan to only make one transaction in our lifetime (or even a couple weeks). Our reserves are held in the multi-signature address and then a final transaction to the blockchain occurs.  Was this not just more load on the users (and network?) than the structure that was already in place?
3 - Cheaters. This is one of the most sketchy parts for me. What does the ending of a transaction and reporting it back to the blockchain look like to the user? Is it possible for the mechanism to prevent cheating be used for cheating itself and the cheater walking away with 100% of the reserve?  Social engineering or otherwise?

So this layer adds a whole economy of centralization? To Bitcoin...

I mean I guess. If that's the logic you want you to use then prison is legal kidnapping.

Bitcoin used to buy coke. Government looks at the blockchain to confirm that the transaction happened for said coke. Government finds key. Takes bitcoin.  
Not theft.

If your into "(those) kind of deals", and you're getting caught, probably not the smartest individual.

Dude, you murder someone or sell heroine to an addict, I don't care where you're from or how big your army is, America or uganda. Prison is the best deterrent we've come up with.  Are you suggesting anarachy?  Is that your argument?

It's stupid. It's just society and how we respond to criminals.

As an individual with a CS degree... define "practicing".

I see you're looking for more details in this very vague hypothetical case I made up. I don't have to come up with every case that it's not theft, I just need to show you one, that's how proofs in formal logic work. I thought you could have filled in the gaps on your own...


You have a recent transaction of 10 mil satoshi, and your partner has a street value of 10 mil satoshi in coke... It's not hard for them to put it together. 


Judge gives a warrant for your phone or ledger to be searched. Gets key.

IN THE WORLD!?
1) Portable than Bitcoin
Atmospheric nitrogen
2) Durable than Bitcoin
3) Divisible than Bitcoin
4) Fungible than Bitcoin (in 2 years)
Guaranteeing no flippining in 2 years?
5) Can't be confiscated
Can be confiscated
6) Can't be censored in transfer
