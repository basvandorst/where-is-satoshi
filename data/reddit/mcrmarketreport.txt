The U.S. stock market was negative at the time that was posted.  I consider BTC hitting a new all-time high very positive as it infers that BTC may be viewed as a potential "safe haven" investment by other investors/traders.  Further weakness in the stock market going forward could be quite positive for BTC if this is true.

Thank you, will move future information over there.

No I don't have any data to back that up, although it would be interesting to research--I'll add that to my list of things to do.  It was simply an observation.

Actually check out the Russell 2000, the small cap index is definitely in a down market at this point.  That's why the media and others focus on the Dow, the underlying breadth of the market is not good at this point.  Yes I consider this a down market.  You are entitled to your own opinion, I'm entitled to mine.

Forgive me. I have no idea when. Point and figure charting only focuses on price not time.

forgive me, I don't understand "redraw for the idea".  Yes it can be used as a stand-alone indicator, but we have more sophisticated models we employ internally.

It's an indicator originally created to trade the S&amp;P 500, Gold, and crude oil that has been adapted to BTC.  Go long when it trades above the upper level (70) and hold until it breaks below the lower level (26), then wait for it to cross back above 70 before initiating another buy.  It's goal is first to manage risk, and second to be profitable.

oh God NO!  First rule of trading/investing is DON'T BLOW UP!  You are what's called a "nervous investor" also known as a "weak holder", if you can't stomach a 20%/40%/60%/possibly 80% drop you are WAY too over-invested.  Get back to a reasonable level where you're not checking the price every 2 minutes.  The run-up in crypto's is attracting the brightest minds in finance who want nothing more than to take your money.  As for how to cope?  Personally, the way I cope with the volatility by developing trading models that take into account the "normal" amount of volatility, and then trades within that environment.  Levels outside of that volatility I'll exit the position.

Bitcoin is now officially in the major leagues, being listed on the CME means that Wall Street officially recognizes Bitcoin as a trade instrument.  That means hundreds of millions to billions of dollars worth of equity may be heading Bitcoin's way.  We remain officially on our BUY signal that we transmitted to subscribers on September 27 at $4102--we're up 61% on that signal alone.

Trading in crypto is so thin that I ONLY RECOMMEND MENTAL STOPS, not hard stops placed with brokers.  Many old Wall St. tricks are at play in the crypto markets where regulation of exchanges is loose or non-existent.  For Bitcoin investors that really don't want to trade, I would say 38% below it's last high.  For traders like myself, 2 consecutive closes below $3963 would force me to exit my position and wait for a new set up (possibly at a higher price).  I don't do any predicting, I only develop rules and trade by them.  Good luck to you.

Below $3000 would indicate a fall more serious than the "normal" volatility seen since the beginning of 2015.  At that point I would have to re-evaluate whether I wanted to hold into a correction more severe than any of its five previous ones.  I'm a believer in BTC.  But that doesn't mean I wouldn't get out of a position if it looked like it could plunge.  I can always get back in, and hopefully at a better price.

My pleasure my friend. I really feel like we're getting in on something huge that's still near the ground floor.  But it doesn't mean there's not going to be some pain and suffering along the way.  Kindest Regards

We use a lot of PNF analysis in our work, I'd be happy to share some ideas
