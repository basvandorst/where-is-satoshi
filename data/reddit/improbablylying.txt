i dont think it was mining for btc.. difficulty too high for regular computers, especially with asic farms.

now, it could have been mining alts. that is plausible.

yes, you totally helped me out.
thank you so much.
when you first commented, everything was still there. nothing had been removed or edited.
so you knew EXACTLY what this thread was about.
and for the record, deleting a thread myself just removes the name of the user who posted it. all other posts and info is still there, dumbfuck.
when mods remove a thread, the entire thing is gone.

the only reason i said "one up" is because you should have seen some of the posts on this sub the day the dogecar raced at talladega.
this entire sub was filled with ***"how do we do something better?!"*** lol
but hell yeah man.
i stand by my thread.
Josh has no chance of showing what he can do against these other racers when his equipment can't match what they have to begin with.
Bitcoin can give him that chance. 200-300 BTC isn't going to crash the value or the market or the miners or whatever other fucking problem doge is going thru day in and day out, ya know.

I can only speak for myself here, but I love both communities. 
I hope to someday have a decent amount of btc, and its all thanks to dogecoin.
I literally never would have gotten started with ANY virtual currency if it weren't for the dogecoin community. 
I'm still sticking with doge too though, even if/when I do have a good amount of btc :)
I think the bitcoiners who "hate" dogecoin are the ones who have been here since the beginning, and they just see all other alts as imposters that shouldn't have any value because btc is the king.
I'm sure there are thousands of other like me. I mean, I can't be the only one who started out with doge and is now trying to accumulate btc and become part of this community too.

@_date: 2014-01-11 00:49:48
Gee, how about every single thread that is started by a newcomer..?
I have also been subject to the negativity when I first tried to take part in this community. 
It was very discouraging.. hence the reason why I had to learn about CC's from dogecoin.
Before DC was ever around I tried to introduce myself here and try to get started.
Instead of help, I got nothing but insults and "go fuck yourself" posts and BS like that.
Then came the massive amount of downvotes and "GTFO's" from users.. 
Unfortunately there are a lot of very bitter people here :(

I've been using bitcoin for about 3 months now, and I've lost quite a bit.
I seem to have a leak somewhere.. all these tips just keep coming out
ah shit, there it goes again!
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:56:45
You're very welcome!
I first started with dogecoin - which led me to my never-ending quest in acquiring BTC! (even though it hasn't exactly been a fruitful quest thus far) :D
I originally tried to get started a few months back with BTC but I just got made fun of, humiliated, and downvoted to hell and back when I posted over in this sub trying to learn the ropes.
If it weren't for DOGE, to this day I never would have gotten even a fraction of a penny's worth of BTC.
The dogecoin community makes it extremely easy for newbies to learn about cryptocurrencies and really does pave the way for new bitcoin members.
As one kind BTC'er pointed out to me awhile back, the bitcoin sub was probably similar to the dogecoin community at some point until the price skyrocketed, which resulted in the "we're so much better than you are!" attitude towards newcomers.
It's cool though man - respect is *earned* and we understand that. One day all shall see the light that there is at the end of the doge tunnel :)
As for crossposting to dogecoin, shit man, go for it.
Feel free to mention me as a reference of the suggestion in your xpost if you like! :P
I literally just donated every dogecoin I had in my tip balance to you for the cause, which I have NEVER done before to anyone or any cause.
So if I think it's worth funding, I'm sure others will as well - especially over in that sub :)
Which reminds me.. that verification post SHOULD be coming along here any time now. It's been 2 hours and 2 minutes since my tip, and the bot is roughly 2 hours behind, so it should be posting shortly! :D
I was serious when I said that our elders should be able to enjoy the same things on the web as we do. It is easy to forget our own mortality at times, but the sad fact is that we are all going to reach that age some day.
I am also very glad to hear that you are a supporter of dogecoins, it really is refreshing to see that not everyone in the bitcoin sub hates on us!
@_date: 2014-03-18 20:50:42
good catch, thanks! :)

@_date: 2014-01-11 03:14:48
I have absolutely NOTHING against bitcoin.
It was literally the founder for all types of cryptos.
Without bitcoin, no alt-coins would exist right now.
I just think it's sad that I had to wait until dogecoins came out to learn the BASICS of how this stuff works, all because my "newbie questions" were not welcome here ages ago when I originally asked about this sort of stuff.
Anyway.. no hard feelings on my end. I love bitcoin, even though I only have like 0.009 of them. 
Whatever though.. I am trying my best here. That's all I can do.
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:34:38
you will need to check your PM's for instructions on accepting his tip from the changetip bot, just a heads-up! :)
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:31:41
I posted this in the other thread before they took it down, so I'll just copy &amp; paste my post from over there:
I absolutely love it! I'm sure you know that already though :)
So I'll explain a little about WHY I love it for the new people who see this thread.
All tips are processed off of the blockchain!
This means that your tips are processed instantly - as long as the person already has an account with ChangeTip, that is.
This also means that there ARE NO FEES when you tip someone!
Now, if you tip someone who has never used ChangeTip before, then they will have to accept / collect the tip before it processes.
Once they do, all future tips will instantly be accepted and added to their balance.
There are NO waiting periods in-between tips.
With bitcointip, your *entire balance* must reconfirm after every tip that you send before you can tip anyone else again - a process which can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour in my experience.
ChangeTip doesn't have that issue, which makes it PERFECT for serial-tippers who like to go on a spree and spread the wealth.
I also LOVE the fact that this bot can be used on multiple websites, and more are being added in the future.
I also love that support for other cryptos (like doge, for example) is going to be integrated in the future.
Another HUGE feature that I love is the ability to cancel tips.
I usually give someone 24-48 hours to accept / collect my tip. If they haven't accepted it by then, I can go in to the 'My Money' tab and cancel that tip on my own.
This returns the tip to my balance, allowing me to give it to other people instead of having it tied up for days on end.
And then there's Nick (This dude is freaking AWESOME. Seriously, you couldn't ask for a better guy to be running this thing.
Any time I've ever needed to contact him about any issues, it seems that I always receive a reply in like 10 minutes flat.. regardless of what time it is. 
It's almost like the guy has a few clones to take over while he's resting... o_O
To sum things up, you owe it to yourself to give ChangeTip a try. You will be glad you did.

2, there are NO popups. i have been using the site for years, and i have never had a single popup. NOR have i ever had any "malware" that you are claiming to be on the site. know why? because it doesn't exist.

obviously we wouldn't want to do this to keep doge in the spotlight.
we would simply.. "let their contract expire" first.
doge can NOT afford to continue funding the guy, and i think he deserves a real chance.

i completely understand, i agree that dogecoin comment threads can get out of hand at times but its all in good fun. no harm is intended by it over there &amp; it fits the community persona quite well, so its fine.
i just hope people start to realize that not all dogecoin people are like that (what was seen yesterday by a lot of us)
im sure as shit not like that, sure i have fun &amp; screw around here &amp; there but i can be &amp; am serious when i need to be.
oh - also, i do understand that when people tip fractions of pennies &amp; stuff like that, it annoys most bitcoin subscribers to no extent. that's why when i tip outside of dogecoin subs i try to tip as much as possible, always at least 20 cents worth (same minimum as bitcointip) and more when i can.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:03:29
I absolutely love it! I'm sure you know that already though :)
So I'll explain a little about WHY I love it for the new people who see this thread.
All tips are processed off of the blockchain!
This means that your tips are processed instantly - as long as the person already has an account with ChangeTip, that is.
This also means that there ARE NO FEES when you tip someone!
Now, if you tip someone who has never used ChangeTip before, then they will have to accept / collect the tip before it processes.
Once they do, all future tips will instantly be accepted and added to their balance.
There are NO waiting periods in-between tips.
With bitcointip, your *entire balance* must reconfirm after every tip that you send before you can tip anyone else again - a process which can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour in my experience.
ChangeTip doesn't have that issue, which makes it PERFECT for serial-tippers who like to go on a spree and spread the wealth.
I also LOVE the fact that this bot can be used on multiple websites, and more are being added in the future.
I also love that support for other cryptos (like doge, for example) is going to be integrated in the future.
Another HUGE feature that I love is the ability to cancel tips.
I usually give someone 24-48 hours to accept / collect my tip. If they haven't accepted it by then, I can go in to the 'My Money' tab and cancel that tip on my own.
This returns the tip to my balance, allowing me to give it to other people instead of having it tied up for days on end.
And then there's Nick (This dude is freaking AWESOME. Seriously, you couldn't ask for a better guy to be running this thing.
Any time I've ever needed to contact him about any issues, it seems that I always receive a reply in like 10 minutes flat.. regardless of what time it is. 
It's almost like the guy has a few clones to take over while he's resting... o_O
To sum things up, you owe it to yourself to give ChangeTip a try. You will be glad you did.

coming from someone who had to learn about cryptos FROM dogecoin BECAUSE of the negativity in this sub - NOPE.
EVERY post in this thread is/was downvoted by YOUR OWN community.
if a doge motive were TRULY behind this thread and what you claim is true, you can bet your sweet ass i would be flooded with upvotes in here right now.
the simple fact that im not just proves you have no idea what you are talking about. fuck off.
the only cancer here is idiots like you.
why you aren't shadowbanned (yet) is beyond me.
even funnier, i'm in here giving out BITCOIN TIPS - AND ASKING WHERE I CAN GIVE MORE BITCOIN TIPS IN OTHER SUBS!!!
yet you accuse me of doing all this and running multiple accounts just to promote dogecoin??
are you fucking retarded?!!! LMFAO!

but it seems like almost every other day someone is bashing dogecoin in the bitcoin sub.

@_date: 2014-03-18 01:31:51
yes, it is..
~~this is why after you tip someone using bitcointip, you cannot tip anybody else until your entire balance is reconfirmed, no matter how much you tipped in the first place.~~ i worded this completely wrong.
as all bitcointip users know, bitcointip has always been on-chain and it never used to require the entire balance to reconfirm after each tip - so that part has nothing to do with being tips being on the blockchain. 
sorry! been drinking tonight, my apologies.
this is why there are fees associated with each tip though.

from what i understand based on my (small) amount of research so far, it has some sort of ASIC-resistant algorithm or something like that to basically prevent ASIC miners from running the show later on down the road.
1 vtc is currently like 4 bucks or something, which isn't bad for a month-old coin. when i bought though, 1 vtc was worth 5 bucks &amp; some change. 
not the best deal (for me, anyway) as of right now, but im just riding it out and seeing where it takes me :)

The attitude over there is warm and welcoming, people enjoy helping answer questions to newcomers instead of just downvoting them to hell and back.
Like I said, it made it extremely easy for me to start learning about this kind of thing without feeling like a "burden" to people.

@_date: 2014-01-27 00:31:54
Transcription doesn't really equate that way when it comes to price though, that's just one of the issues with that.
I've done several transcription jobs for people before, and there is a LOT of playing - typing - replaying - pausing - typing - replaying and so on.
I type almost 100 WPM with 100% accuracy, which helps a little, but people still talk a lot faster than you can type.
A simple 10 minute video can easily take up to 2 or 3 hours to transcribe the entire thing, depending on just how fast the audio is going, any unintelligible pronunciations, etc.
Unless you meant something different by videos by second/minute compared to % of pool share. Either way, I just don't see that being a viable way to get it done unfortunately.
There would be a lot of other factors to consider for each "pool member" to determine their payout other than how long they worked on something - accuracy being the top one.
For example, someone may submit an entry for a video in just 2 minutes, but that doesn't mean they didn't have any typos or screw up what was said vs. what they typed.
You want people who check, double check, and then triple check their accuracy to guarantee that what is being said matches the transcript.

send 3.99 (it will tell you the exact amount of btc to send, dont worry) to the address it gives you for the payment &amp; then just be patient :)

it doesn't get any simpler to understand than what i stated above.
if you want to try and put words in my mouth and/or take my posts out of context, go for it.
you are free to interpret my posts as you want.
but people are free to go back and see my exact wording for themselves
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:33:46
if you dont like doge, dont buy any.
i love doge just as much as i love bitcoin.
without doge, i never would have gotten started with bitcoin.. and i'm sure i'm not the only person who can say that.
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:46:41
how many doge are you wanting to buy?
i can probably cover it, we can make the trade via the tip bots.
you would have to send first though, due to your (lack of) history.
feel free to check my profile history before making a decision. 
you will see that yes, i am serious, and no, i am not lying.

@_date: 2014-02-02 22:56:09
I agree with you on one thing - you did NOT deserve the tip.
I merely sent it as an experiment to see if you will publicly call it creepy and fake, then turn around and privately accept the tip and keep it/trade it for something else.
If you find it to be an "incredible hassle" then simply decline the tip when the bot PM's you. Pretty simple stuff, really.
BTW, the only place I have sent any bitcoin was in dogecoin subs and here in the bitcoin sub - it is hardly "unsolicited"
The people in dogecoin are ecstatic to receive bitcoin.
As for the people I've tipped bitcoins to in this sub? Ha.. I highly doubt they mind my btc tips to them. Give me a break.

got one hell of a deal on it too man, the owner was some rich guy who took perfect care of it and just upgraded to a new zero-turn mower so he was getting rid of the one we bought at an INSANE price. 
he could have easily sold it for like 8-900 bucks if he wanted to. 
then on top of our awesome discounted price, he gave us a GIANT log chain (worth about 125 bucks) to lock it up with while we build a storage shed.

not a single dogecoin tip was given by anybody in here. in fact, quite the opposite. i've been tipping nothing but bitcoin in this subreddit for a very long time now.

All transactions / tips are done off of the blockchain, so there are no fees when you tip someone (or when you receive a tip.)
The only fee you will run in to is a 1% withdrawal fee, and even that is waived for the first 90 days.
As for allowing smaller transactions, he will have to answer that one.

Yeah, I seen that guy's thread when I was searching (the one who made 5 bucks in 3 weeks from them) but he didn't include any of the sites he was using in his post, so I figured it couldn't hurt to ask.
As for "working" for them, that is an interesting idea.. I never thought about searching for a service exchange like that. I'll have to see what I can find.
I really don't mind waiting for a price drop, I'm in no rush. I'm not doing this to try and make enough to live on, lol I have a real job for that.
I can also see what you're saying about the community, that makes sense. What I don't really understand though is why so many people over here have turned.. bitter, I guess would be the word.
You guys have the most valuable coin.. I just imagined you would all be pretty happy and excited about that.
That's why I don't see why there are so many people who seem angry at me for making a simple post.. lol I'm not here to try and piss anybody off, I promise.

i just have a laptop so that isnt happening.
i was tipped $7 from someone a month or so ago, which started my never-ending quest for btc
since then i have been accumulating VERY small amounts from faucets, and last night i sold a small amount of doge for btc.
so i'm up to like 12-13 bucks in btc total now.
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:23:28
Ohhh! That makes sense :D
It's probably a good thing I went with the 32-bit update, I'd hate to have to download the entire chain again if the 64 didn't end up being compatible with the previous 32-bit one.
Thanks again!
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:39:35
yes, i understand that, but bitcointip transactions ARE on-chain transactions.
i think i worded that wrong originally. i've had some drinks tonight so just bear with me.
it doesn't have to reconfirm after each tip BECAUSE they are on-chain transactions. there are FEES for each tip because they are done on-chain.
as we all know, bitcointip never used to require reconfirmation after every tip - and it was still done on the blockchain back then too.
the creator added that security measure due to the malebility (spelling?) issues that surfaced.
now, with changetip, all transactions are processed off-chain so there are no fees, and tips are processed instantly (as long as the receiver already has an account with them, of course)
the only time changetip transactions go on-chain is for deposits or withdrawals.
@_date: 2014-02-05 01:51:19
yes.. i asked stuff that was NOT in the sidebar.
i even asked things ONLY after using the search feature of the sub to see if they had EVER been posted before and was still downvoted to shit for doing so.

that one you just linked to was after i had already started with dogecoin and knew a lot more about how things worked with cryptos (as u can see in the post &amp; my comment replies to others in there)
so i guess people were more welcoming since i had at least gotten started on my own somehow? i dunno.
that .00988 is the tip i was talking about from starlightbreaker (ty again if u happen to see this!!!)
but before i got started with dogecoin &amp; i was completely new the responses were NOT a pretty sight to say the least.. lol its all good now though man, i don't hold grudges.
that is in the past. i was just pointing out that whether some people want to accept it or not, there really IS a lot of negativity towards new people who dont really mean any harm with their posts.

Alright, well I know a lot of people in this sub tend to frown upon dogecoins, but unfortunately I do not have any BTC to donate to your fund.
To this day, I still only have like 8 dollars total worth of BTC and all of that is in the QT client.. :(
So with that being said, even if I do not end up being part of the job, I truly hope you accept my offering and put it towards the funding.
It sounds like a really great cause, I mean, none of us are getting any younger.
We will all be hard of hearing some day.. and helping our elders enjoy the same luxuries of the internet just as we do is a great thing.
So, here is everything I have in my doge balance.
I just checked the current price value of it, and it comes out to $1.95 worth of dogecoins at the current rate.
+ALL doge verify
The bot is a couple of hours behind, so the verification message will be along in like 2 hours or so, assuming you accept it.
I really do wish I had BTC to tip instead, but I don't.. sorry man.
Maybe one day I will be able to spread BTC as well as doge, but today is not that day for me :(

the default fee is like 6 cents.
there, you can stop whining. i just paid your fees for the next 15 or so transactions.
the bot found two amounts in my comment (6 cents and 1 dollar) so it used the smallest amount for the tip (6 cents)
so i have cancelled that one, and re-tipped you the dollar **[here](

That didn't happen because of a "brigade"
That happened because dc is an incredibly active sub, and I'm willing to bet that 80% of the subscribers over there are NOT subscribed to bitcoin's sub yet.
It took me about 3 weeks after getting started in dogecoin's community to even think about attempting to become a part of the bitcoin community again, and even then, that only happened because of a very generous tip from which REALLY sparked my interest in btc.
So the way I see it, the people in dogecoin had no way of knowing there was a discussion even taking place until someone else posted the link over there.
As for the upvotes afterwards.. obviously a lot of people agreed with the OP.

I didn't upvote the post because it was saying dogecoin was better.
I upvoted it because the poster had some very good points, asking things like "why are so many newbies choosing dogecoin to get started in cryptos instead of btc?" and "why are they funding all of these events back to back, but btc isn't?" and all the other valid questions / suggestions he had listed.
&amp; for the record, I also had to get started in dogecoin to learn about how this stuff works because I was downvoted to hell and back my first time trying to introduce myself here &amp; learn.
You can't deny that a lot of subs in here have an "elitist" mentality.

@_date: 2015-05-04 01:32:30
the fact is that you couldn't even raise more than 5k, when ONE FUCKING COIN was worth $1000+
get mad all you want, i'm just calling it how it is.
keep "HODLING!!" - it is clearly working out for you guys :)
@_date: 2015-05-04 02:31:42
nope. individually, btc users don't really donate that much.
collectively (read: as a community).. well, you still really don't seem to be able to donate that much. lol :)
@_date: 2014-04-25 01:43:28
LMFAO. you're seriously creating accounts just to upvote your shit and downvote me? 
that is fucking HILARIOUS.
once again, piss off :)
@_date: 2014-03-25 00:32:57
i like bitcoin and i am experienced with paypal.
does this mean you will you email me 5-10 bucks?
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:32:52
The question itself is simple, however it seems that finding an answer to the question is not.
Who pissed in your cheerios this morning?
@_date: 2014-02-02 06:43:32
you are apparently blind.
the tip has already been sent and verified.
have a great night!

hey now, dogecoin does more than just let people have fun &amp; toss around larger amounts of coins :\
without dogecoin, I never would have been introduced to cryptos at all &amp; I wouldn't be here in with (most) of you fine people :)
i see it as a fun learning platform/stepping stone.
@_date: 2014-03-25 01:24:05
so new translation:
i am just doing anything i can to try and get referrals.
fuck off.

@_date: 2014-03-21 03:15:44
no, its staffers aka interns copy &amp; pasting a single response to all people that mention a certain keyword or keyphrase - in this scenario, bitcoin.
which is why other posters in this thread received the exact same response.
@_date: 2014-02-17 23:54:08
u got it, i always do!
i actually just gave out $1 each to 2 people in a different sub :)
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:20:00
No problem man, keep up the great work &amp; ty for the tip! :D
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:15:42
i'm not bitter at all. i personally couldn't give a fuck less about btc, doge, vtc, ltc, or any other coin anymore.
and yeah - he may have "accidentally" funded half of it himself, even with stolen funds, but they still got the shit done somehow.
but to be fair, that happened the FIRST time it was funded. 
moolah was long gone by the time they funded it again (and again, and again, and again, and so on..............)


it isn't about being interested in nascar. it's about gaining support. gaining adoption. gaining a mainstream audience.
you pansies are so worried about "HODLING!!!!!!" your coins that you refuse to spend even a fraction of one, even if it could lead to all of those things happening and more.
it's quite hilarious.
***but hey! don't mind me!***
*that is GOOD for bitcoin!!!*
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:21:09
i would certainly hope so with some equipment like that!
we just have a Bushnell Voyager 565 x 60 Refractor and we can see the moon with no problems. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:40:27
never said they came to a complete halt. nice try though.
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:53:25
sorry, im a constructive asshole.
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:46:26


stfu. just proved my point.
and for the record, "shawns outpost" hardly counts.
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:28:41
you clearly don't have experience with changetip then.
the minimum withdrawal for this bot (or at least the last time i checked) was $1
**and withdrawal fees are waived for the first 90 days for all users**
sooooo.. yeah.
they will have no problem withdrawing.
next whiny complaint please?
@_date: 2014-01-27 00:25:04
I would be willing to transcribe it for you (play it and type it word for word) if you're willing to spend some cash, if so just let me know and I will check the video out and give a quote! :)
@_date: 2014-01-25 21:26:33
Whoa.. I didn't know bitcointip had games like flipping and rolling and stuff! That is awesome! :D
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:52:29
oh i know!
only thing i can think of to start getting users tipping btc more often is to spread btc via tipping ourselves! :)
thanks for the tip btw!
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:41:01
lol sup man! :)
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:52:52
i am friendly to people who are friendly to me.
i am an asshole to people who are assholes to me.
crazy how that works, right?! :O

have a tip. and OH GOD, it still isn't fucking dogecoin!! what is happening in here?!!!
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:02:11
but do my dollars have a block size limit???? 
because i actually have to use those to pay our rent, pay bills, buy groceries, etc :\
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:39:59
donate/spend.. same thing. bottom line is BTC users are holding on to their coins in hopes of some huge price surge instead of using them anywhere.
but hey, i guess if i bought in at $1k per coin i'd be a little pissed off too, losing 80% of value in just a few months :P
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:24:05
oh i dunno. reality?
bitcoin (and all other cryptos) are great in theory.. not so much in practice.
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:54:21
i'm talking as an individual, not as a community.
you people are all so worried about "sending what *could* become the next 10 thousand dollar pizza!!" that you refuse to spend.
90% of you chip in laughable amounts of "bits" towards something, while waiting for others to pick up the slack.
you know exactly what i'm talking about.. and so does everyone else.
if what i'm saying were false, we would have witnessed a BTC F1 car.
you aren't "fighting the man" whatsoever.
the only thing you people are fighting is your own wallet at this rate. just keeps dropping and dropping and ^dropping^and^dropping^and^dropping.....
@_date: 2015-05-24 19:59:06
i am Satoshi.
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:27:09
awesome :)
so you have the moniker set up to be 1 credit = 1 satoshi?
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:37:41
what is good for bitcoin is good for dogecoin &amp; we shouldn't be trying to compete with or bad-talk btc at all!
sooner or later the new shibes (well, hopefully ALL shibes) will understand that :)
now coinye.. ha.. dont even get me started on coinye.. i hope those fucks die a slow and painful cryptocurrency death.
but i have nothing but love for bitcoin &lt;3

hm.. interesting proposal.
here's a thought though!
how about i *don't* send him anything and i continue to laugh.
yeah. i'll go that route. 
@_date: 2015-08-08 22:51:39
Step 1: Print 50 paper wallets.
Step 2: Send $1 to the public address of each paper wallet.
Step 3: Distribute paper wallets as you see fit (along with instructions on how to redeem AND keep secure)
Step 4: ????
Step 5: This is good for bitcoin..?
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:21:04
looks interesting!
how do i make the deposit though? this is different..
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:13:04
Ah forgot about them. How's their deposit &amp; withdrawal times? I'm looking for one that is just as fast (or faster) than Bittrex was.
edit: Kraken won't work. Says I'm not authorized as a Tier 0 user to deposit anything. Fuck that
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:11:43
sup couch, how ya been?
tip me $10 haha :P

the bookmark i had it saved as is no longer there because they changed the site, that's why i thought it was shut down. awesome!

btc users: FUCK BANKS AND REGULATION!
btc users when coinbase launches a bank: "FUCK YEAH, BANK WITH REGULATIONS!"
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:25:06
is a "normal job" out of the question? because you really suck at this crypto shit.
@_date: 2015-02-14 00:22:02
a select few hold 90+ percent of all current btc in circulation. far from decentralized.
coinbank (TM, if you fucks decide to use this term you best pay for it) isn't going to change a thing in that aspect.
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:58:43
Precisely :)
