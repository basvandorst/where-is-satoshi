Learning something new everyday! Thank you.
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:51:16
So basically electrum?
@_date: 2014-07-11 16:19:39
I'm not really familiar with blockchain but mycelium backs up the wallet by making an encrypted pdf. You can't choose the passphrase though. So yes mycelium is encrypted. I'm pretty sure blockchain is as well.
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:29:32
Do they take Discover cards?
@_date: 2014-10-09 15:06:04
Yup already did thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:37:07
This sounds really awesome and useful. Please make it open source! I'm setting up a changetip account now but once its all set up I will definitely throw a tip your way.
@_date: 2014-09-26 19:08:00
Check out BIP38. Just send them an encrypted qr code. Problem solved
@_date: 2014-06-20 17:00:10
Ok now I definitely think you should make this happen! It would also be cool if you did the crowfinding on a site that takes bitcoins. I don't know how realistic that would be though. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:28:31
I don't even have a whole bitcoin yet so yeah it's definitely overkill. I just think its fun learning about these things. :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:38:59
I'll use these to generate my private key rather than trusting the random number generator in the code. I use bitaddress.org (offline on a Ubuntu liveCD) because it supports entering hexadecimal values. As someone else pointed out bitaddress also supports base6 so you can use normal 6 sided dice as well. You just need to roll it 99 times if I understand correctly. With my two hex dice I only need to do 32 rolls I think.
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:43:27
I like using bitaddress.org since you can input the rolls directly as hex. Super easy
@_date: 2014-10-09 18:29:38
Got it thanks. I'm just having trouble getting my online copy to sync up with the blockchain. A normal person probably would have given up and just used electrum by now haha. But I want the best security bitcoin has to offer.
@_date: 2014-07-09 05:26:55
Congratulations to the team! For the t-shirts I would really like to see a more minimalist design. I think I saw in a youtube video some mycelium employee was wearing one that had just the logo and it was pretty big. That would be cool. Will entropy eventually be on sale to the public?
@_date: 2014-01-14 06:09:57
It does seem a little worrying. Although one thing that gives me a little hope is that less than half of all 21 million bitcoins have been mined. So there's a small chance of some redistribution there. But the way things are going, it seems like the majority of the future coins will still go to the wealthiest people with the resources to setup the biggest mining farms.
But maybe that's not necessarily a bad thing. Maybe these people with a lot of BTC will invest back in the Bitcoin economy and infrastructure, thereby raising the value of the Bitcoin network as a whole, which would raise the price of BTC for everyone!
Ultimately I think the market will decide with people flocking to other altcoins that address this like said. I don't see it being a problem at the moment.
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:51:55
According to  a private key needs 64 hexadecimal characters. So with my 2 dice that's 32 rolls. I think haha
@_date: 2014-07-22 05:18:59
If someone hacks your coinbase account and drained your card with instant buy, would that would be covered by visa like any other theft? I think it would be but I'm just curious.
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:22:04
Ahh I see. Thank you
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:41:19
Could you elaborate a little more on this? What would I do exactly to reduce this bias?
@_date: 2014-10-31 05:13:36
Totally. Coachella (and probably others) use nfc wristbands to get in the festival and check in at different stages which posts to social media profiles you link beforehand. It works well for getting into the festival but the social media posts seem gimmicky.   
What would be super awesome is if there was a bitcoin address associated with the nfc wristband that you could load beforehand or even at the festival itself and make it super easy to pay for things. It would be a nice way to limit spending while also speeding up payments.
@_date: 2014-10-09 06:59:21
Ok cool. Yeah the online copy is still building the database but as soon as I can I'm going to do an offline test spend. Thanks for replying. $2.50 @_date: 2014-06-20 08:38:23
I would absolutely pitch in to such a project. However if you do go through with it please outline your plans for distribution beforehand so people at least know what they are getting into.
If the funding for this movie does end up being raised all through crowdsourcing, I would love to see a DRM free digital download as a perk for contributing.
@_date: 2014-04-21 18:17:48
The way I look at it bitcoin is risky enough. Any time you talk about mining or buying stocks you're just compounding that risk. Maybe the reward will be higher but that's to much risk for me. I just invest by buying bitcoins themselves and making occasional purchases to support the economy.  
Good luck with whatever you decide to do.
@_date: 2014-10-16 18:23:50
Exactly. They would be able to create as many of these coins as they wanted so now were just back where we started. With bitcoin the power lies with the people.
@_date: 2014-10-09 19:58:41
It's synced! All it needed was a restart. But thanks for the info.
@_date: 2014-09-21 20:19:55
I would assume the seller would provide evidence the item was delivered. Things like screenshots or even a link to the tracking info and whatnot. It's not perfect but it should work pretty well.
@_date: 2014-04-18 17:59:50
I got the feature when mycelium updated just a few days ago. You'll probably see the update any day now.
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:26:15
Looks cool. Does the 24 hour delay mean transactions take a day to go through? Sorry I'm sort of a noob.
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:50:07
Well it's open source so that helps. And I could always verify the hash of the file to make sure it wasn't modified. Now that I think about it since I'm already putting all this work into this I might as well learn how to do that.
@_date: 2014-06-27 06:45:02
I am a man of my word. I like your attitude towards fixing problems. Your tool would be really cool, and I really want to see it happen.  
10,000 bits @_date: 2016-12-29 23:32:06
It's a website called bitnodes. It's useful for monitoring your node and making sure it's open and accepting connections.
@_date: 2015-07-30 06:55:49
The trezor does look very nice. Keepkey looks cool to. I'm personally waiting for the ledger blue. A ledger harware wallet with a screen and bluetooth/nfc would be pretty cool. I'll just keep using armory cold storage until the hardware wallet market matures a bit more. Yeah it sucks taking 10 minutes to spend from it but I almost never do spend from it since it's savings. Plus it's "free" with the cost just being inconvenience and time.
@_date: 2016-02-08 18:15:07
Sounds like Electrum would be a good choice for you.
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:46:21
This looks promising.
@_date: 2016-09-20 23:04:57
Thank you! Now if I could just get it installed haha. Still learning this whole linux thing.
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:39:00
Now let's just hope segregated witness gets activated sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2015-09-05 20:16:44
Checkout mycelium gear. Techinically it's a 3rd party but their involvement is about as limited as can reasonably be without doing it all yourself.
@_date: 2016-10-31 16:10:30
Op this is the answer. When you open the wallet properties near the top you can specify who the wallet owner is. You need to select yourself as the owner.
@_date: 2016-07-28 17:11:15
Check out Balaji srinivasan's talk called the machine payable web on YouTube. The true utilization of bitcoin is still a ways off but it's coming.
@_date: 2016-07-21 20:30:56
Can I add my own node as a trusted peer and connect to it exclusively? I'm using schildbach's Android wallet and I want to switch but I really want this feature.
@_date: 2013-06-04 00:10:26
Try disabling your extensions. Worked for me on chrome in windows 8.
@_date: 2013-12-23 07:05:05
I feel like the biggest benefit to using bitcoin for remittances is choice. You're free to convert it to fiat using whatever service is cheapest or most convenient for you. Using bitcoin you're no longer a slave to whatever fees western union imposes. You can also convert the bare minimum you need to pay the essentials like bills and taxes and keep the rest in bitcoin which saves money as well. As the bitcoin economy grows and the volatility decreases the incentive to keep it in bitcoin will increase.
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:14:20
I've been curious about this as well. I remember in one of Andreas Antonopoulos' videos he briefly mentioned having a paper currency backed by bitcoin would be extremely helpful for developing countries that don't have the infrastructure to fully adopt bitcoin. It sounds great in theory but I can't even begin to think of all the problems that have to be overcome for it to actually be successful. Although people said the same thing about cryptocurrencies in general and look how far we've come :)
@_date: 2013-06-03 23:19:12
For everyone having trouble viewing the video, try disabling your extensions. I couldn't view it or download the video using chrome on windows 8 but after disabling adblock, disconnect, and https everywhere it worked like a charm.
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:33:40
Oh yeah there will fees to change into your local currency no doubt. I guess I should have been more clear. What I was trying to say is using bitcoin your free to shop around and use the service that has lowest fees or is most convenient, whether it's a traditional exchange or localbitcoins or whatever. Although I should add using localbitcoins you could sell slightly above the exchange rate in which case you wouldn't lose money but actually make money. If you're using a regular exchange, your free to convert as much or as little to fiat you want and pay the fees only on what's converted. This would be cheaper than paying fees for sending the whole lump sum through WU even if they do lower their fees to stay competitive. It's all about having the choice to do what's cheapest or most convenient for you. For these reasons I think it's going going to be big in the remittance market.
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:33:24
Do you have a source for this? The US government accepting btc for taxes is news to me.
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:47:45


Which also contributes to it's intrinsic value. I thought that was pretty insightful.
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:03:38
Pretty much the same way you would pay for coffee or anything else in a store. The most common setup is the merchant uses a tablet with software from coinbase/bitpay that converts the total in dollars to bitcoin on the spot and generates a qr code that you scan with your phone to pay. Pretty simple to setup really if you know what you're doing.
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:38:05
Check out proofofexistence.com
    It seems like a similar service from what I understand.
