Unless your running electrum on a web  server you should be OK(?), according to this from the original link at the top of the page:
"The JSONRPC interface is not about your personal wallet at home. It is mostly used by web servers for remotely executing commands, like handling a wallet via a web interface or accepting web payments.
While the electrum daemon is running, someone on a different virtual host of the web server could easily access your wallet via the local RPC port"

If your coins were used previously by someoe else for a crime, your coins may be seized by law enforcement if not fungible,  even if you did nothing wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:04:57
It's not necessary you doing anything illegal, if you get coins that were previously used in a crime and can be identified, then they may be seized from you.
Fungibility is a cornerstone of sound money and thus the greatest concern for bitcoin. Imo. The only thing that I can see with LN practically solving this problem is the limit on the amount. And that will be upped in time, i suppose.

What is flawed about people engaging in saving and in the free exchange of goods and services in a market for agreed price, without govt interference and central bank monopoly fiat ? That is Austrian Economics and most people who criticize that don't understand it.
The opposite, everything else, ensures that a person, committee or cabal inserts themselves into the free trade and allocates resources on your behalf. Because they of course know better than you how to spend your hard earned money.  The grotesque arrogance of this is lost through the nice sounding caring platitudes that disguise it. The greatest crimes in history have been committed under this ruse.

velocity is linked to inflation of the money supply caused by printing money. It refers to propensity to hold the money rather than spend it. Just before Hyperinflation the velocity is max, people wont hold onto the fast depreciating money for more than  minutes. Until eventually they won't accept the money at all. In stable, sound money people will save a certain amount and spend on what they feel they need. As it should be.

 Buy up all the bitcoin , or enough to corner the market. And how will they do that ? Use payment aggregators like bakkt and also etfs. Bitcoin flows into these aggregators as people spend and invest, and they use client facing custodial wallets to fraction the coins, while the actual coins leak out the backdoor. Don't think its possible?  See gold for details.

It's the value of that Samuelson as currency that has lost almost all it's value because it was counterfeited day and night by printing more and thus fractioning gold reserves which at one time underpinned Samuelsons' value. Gold is a non-inflating reserve currency,  which the Samuelson was supposed to be able to be freely swapped for at a bank. You could swap 90%+ more gold when for the Samuelson when it was first created than you can now. In fact, you get zero gold now at a bank for your Samuelson.

All those currencies were nominally based on gold. However, they were obviously being inflated hence they all collapsed. The dollar was backed by gold until 1971, it was cast adrift because it was being inflated to fund the Vietnam war and the gold peg could no longer be maintained, despite manipluating the dollar price of gold via the London Gold Pool and other shenanigans.   I think the dollar is in its final blow off topping before collapse. Disclaimer: I don't have an infallible crystal ball.

He is trying to point out the mal-investment that occurs when money is unsound.(inflated). It reaches deep down into society and perverts it, turning it into a gambling society where all sorts of esoteric trinkets that normally have little value get speculated upon. The economist Henry Hazlitt put it this way :
"It is not merely that inflation breeds dishonesty in a nation. Inflation is itself a dishonest act on the part of government, and sets the example for private citizens. When modern governments inflate by increasing the paper-money supply, directly or indirectly, they do in principle what kings once did when they clipped coins. Diluting the money supply with paper is the moral equivalent of diluting the milk supply with water. Notwithstanding all the pious pretenses of governments that inflation is some evil visitation from without, inflation is practically always the result of deliberate governmental policy.....In a free enterprise system, with an honest and stable money, there is dominantly a close link between effort and productivity, on the one hand, and economic reward on the other. Inflation severs this link. Reward comes to depend less and less on effort and production, and more and more on successful gambling and luck."
Andrew Dickson White in his  book, Fiat Money Inflation in France wrote:
 
"With prices soaring and the value of money savings rapidly diminishing, an early effect was the obliteration of thrift. Accompanying this was a cancerous increase in speculation and gambling. Stock jobbing became rife. More and more people began to see the advantages of borrowing and later paying off in depreciated money. A great debtor class grew up whose interest was to keep the inflation going. Workers, finding themselves with less and less real pay in terms of what their wages would buy, while others grew rich by gambling, began to lose interest in steady work. The evaporation of the incomes and savings of the lower and middle classes, and the sudden enrichment of speculators, with their ostentatious luxury, led to mounting social resentment and unrest. Cynicism and corruption set in. Even Mirabeau, who only a few months before had risked imprisonment and even death to establish constitutional government, began secretly receiving heavy bribes. The evidence of the general spread of corruption led to widespread distrust and a loss of faith in patriotism or virtue."

Am I correct in saying that regression does not factor in volatility, if volatility (amplitude from the regression) is scattered equally around the regression it will not project  much about maximums or minimums in price at any time ?
This guy drew another plot, instead  using a price supporting trend line on the same power chart. I think this has some value saying "precisely" what the minimum price will be at any time. His prices differ somewhat (not too much)from yours because his plot starts later than the Genesis block, maybe because those first few months were deemed too noisy ?

Following events of the financial industry before, during and after 2008, the only reaction to that industry can be cynicism.

It is the definition of ponzi. They create money out of thin air when they make a loan, but the interest payable on that loan is not created by the loan. Where does the money come from to pay the interest ? Out of velocity ie circulating money or new loans. The more loans made the faster the velocity required and the more new loans that need to be made. ie. the property loan bubble, the car loan bubble, the student loan bubble, the sovereign loan bubble. Until the world is debt sodden and unable to bear the load. And when the economy contracts and velocity drops the banking ponzi crashes in a heap. 
That's why they keep exhorting you to buy, buy, buy ! To keeps that ponzi levitating. It is a criminal wealth transfer from the working stiffs(debt slaves) to the usurers(money changers).

"There is no lawful consideration for these Federal Reserve Notes to circulate as money. The banks actually obtained these notes for the cost of printing. A lawful consideration must exist for a note...
"The activity of the Federal Reserve Banks...and the First National Bank of Montgomery, is contrary to public policy and contrary to the Constitution of the United States, and constitutes an unlawful creation of money and credit for no valuable consideration.

there are many situations where it is valuable to have a forensic breakdown of where the money flowed. Eg. in managed funds where investors want to know that allocations are actually made where they we told they were. I'm not sure that monero would be conducive to that.

Sound money that's not inflated can fix major problems , mainly by allocating resources more effectively ,iow, diminishing mal-investment.
When the money supply is being counterfeited(inflated)  the changes in the cost of money impinges on the price of investments..It becomes blurred what the real supply/demand cost of an investment is and what part is merely a change in the price of money due to inflation.  Investing becomes a casino, mostly an interest rate(price of money) casino, and allocation of resources via investment becomes suboptimal. Waste and imbalances ensue. Boom and bust are the results. 
Sound money does not solve all economic problems,  but without sound money it's almost impossible to have a sustained, healthy economy. 
Edit:  bitcoin has all the properties for sound money, it's just in volatile uptake phase. Once this phase completes expect a steady state of stable rates and low price volatility.

Another potential opportunity to rehypothecate imo are these payment processors that are lining up eg. Microsoft with starbucks, where payments will be "processed in the cloud".

Etf are used to set the price, not track it. And especially so are the futures markets. Eg. There is no official gold spot price. The official gold price is the nearest month's futures price. A paper price.
Paper pushers can sell short(and naked sell short) far more paper than exists in the underlying. That's price suppression.
When you walk into a gold shop they take the day's ruling price from the news wires. 
People say "the bitcoin futures market is innocuous because you cannot take delivery of bitcoin". What they don't get is if one fine day they make the "official" Bitcoin price the futures price. And saturate the message all over the newswires. Then it becomes reality and the price is controlled.

Fractioning assets (creating more paper claims than actual assets)  is one thing, and with btc, unlike gold, there is a public auditable trail of each coin on the blockchain. And any investors can view this and that makes all the difference.
What worries me somewhat is the broadcast of a "ruling price" that the powers that be wish to broadcast. Eg. They do that with gold. The price of gold(pog) that is broadcast on the msm and on the ticker quotes is the nearest month futures price. NOT the spot (otc)price ! Its a paper gold  price. And very few people know that. People think its the spot price. I think this will be attempted with the Bitcoin price, to control the price.

The etf will be an offchain custodial wallet,  just like the exchanges , and they'll tell you whatever lies they want about the wallet. Your pension funds will purchase it on your behalf ,with or without your permission, for fees all around for the insiders without verification. If it's anything like the gold etf, it'll be used as an aggregating(centralizing) vehicle to aquire large amounts of bitcoin to manipulate the market(corner), and that's the last anyone else will see of them.
Wall st is one big hypothecating machine. It's job is to put layers of paper between you and the underlying asset and to generate charges at each layer. Often the underlying has been sold long ago and doesn't even exist anymore. They will change the rules on you in a heartbeat. Famously, eg. see what they did to Bunker Hunt.
If you trust wall st, I have a bridge to sell you.People enamoured by wall st don't understand wall st, or are in on the "Bezzle".

You buy as you do with tech, when you need it and after consideration vs saving. You don't stop spending, you still buy tech equipment that is falling in price. Deflation is a different tradeoff equation than if your money is losing value\(inflation\) and you want to get rid of the money fast before it loses anymore value. With deflation saving becomes a consideration. Deferred spending and taking care of your own monetary future by saving becomes an issue. ie. The time preference equation for spending changes. 
This means in a mild deflation your spending becomes more thoughtful, you tend to buy quality and you don't borrow to spend, you spend from savings. Money flows to the most productive and innovative businesses.  In an inflation your priority is to  dispose of money before it becomes less valuable. Money flows willy\-nilly to less competent businesses, because if the goods are junk you'll just borrow cheap and buy more tomorrow.  Malinvestment ensues, ie. money is wasted.

With the gold ETF it is thought to be used for :
1. Aggregating tons of gold centrally
2. Unlimited paper "custodian" gold shares can be sold onto the ETF to suppress price. Share dilution.
3. The gold can be transferred out the back door to whoever has the power.
4. The "audit" will be whatever they say it is, just like the FED "audit", you won't be involved.
A very bad idea
Ps: the official gold price is set, not in the spot market but by using the nearest month futures price.  A paper price which can be manipulated with paper.

two reasons: 
1. Because the QE method of increasing the money supply involves the central bank buying bonds from the banks at a guaranteeed profit for the banks, this drives bond yields down and all the proceeds go to the banks who use them to buy more bonds to sell to the central bank. Money doesn't leave this trade. The rest of the economy is short of money, rates drop and it manifests as deflation.
2. Japan's rates are so low that a carry trade ensues where the yen is sold short for treasuries  and the difference in yield is profit. 
The more they print yen, the more deflation they reap. Until this insanity breaks, as it will, then we'll have global hyperinflation. Because most of the world is also doing QE

\&gt;if there was no lending at all.
No. In a fixed supply , deflating currency regime\(sound money\) lending takes place, money has to be borrowed from another part of the economy and that part of the economy loses access that money until it is repaid\(or lost if it is permanently defaulted upon\). This causes both the lender and the borrower to have risk and be cautious making loans and doing extensive due diligence, unlike today where the money is created\(printed\) for free when a load is made. Today the lender has no risk, the borrower works as a debt slave to repay the lender , carrying all the risk.
Even better , to mitigate the deflationary increase of the burden of paying interest, loans made in a sound money regime should pay no interest, lenders should only partake in a share of profits if the loans perform. If the loans default, the lender , apart from collateral agreements, loses the loaned money. That's the risk. This has the effect of focusing the minds of the parties to the loan. As it should be, rather than this orgy of reckless , mal\-invested lending that causes great booms and great busts.

There is a reason that a non-inflating money's value may not go up indefinitely. Reduced demand. Demand for money is a thing and during economic contractions there is a reduced demand for money. Under Schumpeter's Creative Destruction there also may not be an increase in demand for money, the economy recycles itself and demand may stay constant. Under the wasteful and unsustainable debt-based GDP measure of increasing output , demand for money may keep increasing until the debt becomes so onerous that the economy crashes and demand dries up.

The problem is money as debt. Where interest on loans is payable on money created for the loan ,out of thin air at no cost to the lender,from the moment the loan is made. Even if the loan does not perform. And the money to pay the interest must come from money already created, by velocity or from new money from loans ,by inflation .  The risk is asymmetrically on the borrower.  
That's usury. And it's inflationary,  immoral , unsound and unsustainable.

Futures are hedging mechanisms that enable large positions in the underlying with far less risk. Eg. If you have unlimited fiat (some guys print the stuff ), you can hedge by buying long futures and then short a similar size of actual bitcoins (without upside risk ) at technical inflection points in the relatively thinly traded Bitcoin market and collapse the price. Make a killing, rinse and repeat ad nauseum. Without the futures hedge you cannot take large short positions without the risk of being wiped out. 
There are other strategies.
@_date: 2019-03-28 07:29:25
Nonsense. The bank gets the interest + principal or the collateral , depending if the loan defaults or not. For creating money out of thin air that costs them nothing, there is zero risk to the bank. It's usury defined.
In sharia banking(or sound money banking) , 100% reserve banking, only gold(or sound money) savings can be loaned, and only at the permission of the saver. The saver and the bank take a risk because the saver loses access to his saving for the duration of the loan and may lose his gold entirely if the loan fails,  and there may be no income because income(not interest) is profit sharing only if the loan performs(is invested in an enterprise that makes a profit). There is no interest charged from day 1 regardless if the loan performs or not , as in usury.  
Usury  is the so-called business cycle of boom and bust. Interest payments on risk free loans(to the banks) accrues until the debt servicing is larger than the economy can bear and then you get the bust. And the coming bust will dwarf the last one, maybe all of them.  
@_date: 2018-10-26 20:46:47
This is correct. Adam Smith's Real Bills or equivalent notes will arise spontaneously and be used as currency until they are redeemed for bitcoins. Eg. Orders on manufactured goods are placed that are completed and paid for in the future, but in the meantime materials must be purchased and labor wages paid. Notes that are future claims on the underlying sound money will be issued by banks or similar and will circulate as currency until they are redeemed. In the 19th century the world economy boomed on such arrangements. Except then it was gold not bitcoin. 
The problems will start if the paper bitcoins are irredeemable and there is no underlying bitcoin. Just as with fiat paper. The blockchain will make that more difficult, but wall st is endlessly creative, if nothing else.

Yes, Antonop makes my case ! Airgapped is more secure than HW. That's the point, that was our original debate. Security ! However, he says that since HW is probably easier to use than airgapped for less tech people, they should rather use a HW. I happen to think that airgapped may be even easier to use than HW, but that is debatable. Trace Mayer is advocating an extreme form of airgapped, but it's still airgapped and the most secure.
airgapped : Take a old andoid phone, disable all comms, install electrum , create a wallet offline and you are good to receive coins immediately. ZERO possiblilty of being hacked online, because you never interface online. To send coins a bit more tricky, but not much more.

Looks like the imf is planning to issue their own shitcoin that they will issue instead of cash notes, that can be endlessly devalued and force you to keep it as deposits with the banks so that you  pay them more and more interest for the privilege, forever  (negative rates). This is to prevent you from going outside the banking system and stuffing your mattress with cash notes. Bad luck, bitcoin can perform the latter role, with security and relative privacy. People will rush to stuff their metaphorical mattresses (private wallets ) with bitcoin.

This post is so wrong, i would take an essay to correct. Suffice to say, inflation of the money supply is always wrong, is always a stealth tax on savers, it always forcing uniform time preference on consumers no matter what their circumstances, always causes misallocation of economic resources by forcing rates artificially lower,  and always ends in hyperinflation and economic wreckage. By the math of geometric progression. Inflation of the money supply is dishonest and criminal.
 "In a free enterprise system, with an honest and stable money, there is dominantly a close link between effort and productivity, on the one hand, and economic reward on the other. Inflation severs this link. Reward comes to depend less and less on effort and production, and more and more on successful gambling and luck." -

It's the subsequent use of the bitcoins that matters wrt fungibilty, not while you're holding them in the wasabi wallet.

Why not ? Why can't it become understood that bitcoin can be as secure or insecure as you prefer, with the known trade-offs. Merchants may want 0-conf with the resulting increase in revenue (throughput) and build the cost of potential fraud into their prices as a cost of doing business. Most people are honest. Merchants with large transactions will demand more confirmations   Why not ?
I think this may be the practical way it will go ,assuming the fees are economic relative to the cost of goods. If not then LN will be used.

How about zero routing ?  You want to pay or get paid, create a direct connection. So the trade off is lots of connections, maybe not a problem, the win is the NP problem and all intermediate state goes away. 
I'm not saying LN isn't the simplest method, it's just very complicated and I believe thats primarily due to the NP problem and the resulting intermediate states.

Yes. The exchange will loan out the coins for shorting. When you short sell anything you borrow that thing from the exchange which is owned by someone else , and sell it. You are hoping to buy it back later at a lower price and return it to the original owner. But after you take the borrowed item and sell it , two people now think they own it, they guy who you borrowed it from and the guy you sold it to. If it gets borrowed again 3 people will think they own the same item. Fractional Reserves.
Get your bitcoins off the exchanges. !
Ps: exchanges may still lend "bitcoins" for shorting, but if they don't have real bitcoins they will be imaginary coins,  or just book entries of non-existant coins. That's called naked short selling and is illegal but still happens.

The collateral is the problem. In this irredeemable fiat system where the fiat itself is the collateral, you can never extinguish the debt. You borrow the collateral into existence out of thin air as debt. It is only where there exists an underlying that is created debt free that can be used as collateral to extinguish debt, eg. Gold and bitcoin, that you have some form of scale against which to measure  the debt. Traditionally, an increase in the price of gold in fiat told you that too much fiat debt was created. Now you have fiat debt collateralized against fiat debt and you have no idea what is going on....until it blows up.

The main fear imo, is how quick bch degenerated into consensus unravelling , ripping itself apart and becoming chaotic. This was not some fringe group of disaffecteds forking off , but a central implosion.  It highlights how fragile consensus is, how fast antagonisms grow and spread from nothing,  and this may have spooked some across crypto.

As opposed to wall to wall meme cheerleading ?
I think we need more balanced discussion. In investing you stay alive by first identifying the pitfalls and then the upside. Here it's just blinded upside.
 I would like to see things like potential market cornering from entities with access to "unlimited" fiat like central banks,  robustness of consensus(bch imploded in a civil war , consensus fracture) , does hodling impact price at all which is related to stocks vs flows in bitcoin and marginal price, and maybe what has been discussed but without resolution imo sudo offline hardware wallets(they're plugged into online machines) vs physically offline wallets. And similar.
All these directly  impact the viability of bitcoin but don't get mentioned much or at all, because of muh cheerleaders! 
@_date: 2018-11-19 08:22:58
Cornering a market is centralization. That's my fear. If a BTC-&gt;fiat payment processor like eg. Baakt becomes ubiquitous pulling in btc globally and paying out fiat, they may gain enough btc to corner the market and control the price. 
Etf is another monster. There they accumulate btc and issue shares. The shares can be supplied in unlimited quantities by naked shorting to suppress the price. This happens in the gold etf. And those naive enough to believe "it's illegal , call the SEC!" are in for a rude awakening. The SEC has in the past ignored them. At times it appears they side with the crooks. John Corzine is exhibit A. His gold hedge fund folded and he pocketed all the gold. He's walking around free living off the fat of the land. 
Wall st is a big club "and you ain't in it !"
Edit: I disagree with Trace Mayer that hodlers will always save bitcoin. Maybe he hasn't heard of stocks-to-flows ? Price is set at the margin by flows, the bitcoin being traded. To control the price you only have to control the flows and that maybe a relatively small amount. If baakt gets big enough that will be easy.

No you didn't.  And if they didn't do these illegal actions the entire financial system would have collapsed. It is still going to collapse and your stocks and bonds will be flushed. That's why we invest in bitcoin. And I just hope they haven't got hold of that.

That's not according to Caitin Long,as I understand it. If you are holding assets pledged in a lien, your lien or someone elses, and a court claims them , you will lose them. Period. If they're fungible then the point is moot
The only other way around this is if there is a statute of limitations,  as in wyoming, where the claims will expire in time.

That statement is correct, but it was not the spark that lit the fuse interbank loans freezing was the spark. We have more derivative debt now than we had in 2008, just slightly different,  more in the corporate area than real estate. The collapse this time will be slightly different but much bigger.
What bitcoins gives is an ability to mark derivatives to market,  by anyone who owns them having the ability to immediately pull them off exchanges  and from third parties and store them themselves at any point. That makes it very risky for anyone to write massive derivatives on bitcoin. Added to the fact that bitcoin trades 24x7 outside of  official exchanges. There are no official exchanges.

The answer to your question is "Triffin's Dilemma". Look it up

The problem is money issued as interest bearing debt, out of thin air. There is no risk to the lender, all the risk is on the borrower including posting collateral. The interest to pay that debt is not issued when the new money is created, that interest must come from new debt money from thin air or money already circulating at sufficient velocity. This system drives the price of money down (oversupply/inflation) and thus causes economic distortion and malinvestment.
Eventually the economy buckles under the weight of debt and it becomes unserviceable, at which point the economy slows, velocity goes to zero and debt is defaulted upon and the system crashes. 
This system is known as usury. It is immoral and in many places illegal. The proceeds flow to the money printers, the economic life gets sucked out of the economy. We all become debt slaves.
Fractional reserve money that is not interest bearing debt is OK as long as it can be marked periodically to a debt free sound money that doesn't inflate.(marked to market) Eg marked to gold and bitcoins. Eg. Govt can issue debt free money, no need for this privately owned debt based usurious money monster. 
The private debt money printers employ armies of so called economists to write reams of junk science papers justifying this scam, and award them prizes like the Nobel. It's a turkey that's all dressed up as a knave. Don't fall for their BS.

Banks create money from thin air when they loan out money. They print money. Increasing the supply of money drives down the price (interest rate). A lower rate increases the liquidation price of debt(present value of debt) making debt more onerous. 
This is not the free market at work, it is a monopoly rigging the interest rates.
If you printed money, you'd go to jail.

The lag between when the new money is created and the interest rates adjust for inflation is where the insiders have the edge. Those advantage flows to the money printers. In effect it's a tax on savings and the beneficiarys are the printers. 
Also, the central banks are privately owned by private commercial banks. They have first knowledge of a interest rate change by the central banks. They can place risk free bets in the derivatives markets on this information and make a killing.
And lastly, QE is guaranteeing to buy bonds from the member banks by the central banks. This is a risk free profitable trade for the commercial banks. Unlimited profits as long as it continues. This again drives rates down and steals money from savers.
This system is pure ponzi. People who think it's not, don't understand how it works.

"The accounting to figure who of their customers owns which of those bitcoins is stored on a database. " 
Yes ! But the database list is not 1:1 customer to private key. There is just a mess of bitcoins in a wallet/s with one or more  private keys on the blockchain, and  a list in the database of who owns how many coins, not which exact coins linked to a specific private key. And how many of those customers have phantom paper bitcoins.? If one real Bitcoin is borrowed and sold short, nobody can attach an owner's name to the coin, it comes from the pool of coins in the wallet on the blockchain,  now there is one real btc owner , the guy who borrowed the btc and one paper btc owner, the guy who loaned the btc and as yet unidentifyable. Who do they contact to say "your coin has been borrowed"? Nobody because they don't know! So they leave it and make some gross balance adjustment note in the database and meanwhile  everyone still thinks they own all their coins.  Now there are more owners claims to btc in the database than actual btc in the wallet on the blockchain.
 How do I know this ? Because we have seen , for example, a massive move of coins from one address to another and it has been  identified that it was an exchange moving the coins. ie.Thousands or millions of customers' coins stored at a single address moved in one txn. There is no way to identify whose coins have been loaned by attaching a name and private key to a specific coin. This is why exchanges could be used as mixers, although not great mixers because although the txn trail would be broken you still have to do kyc/aml on the coins you withdraw.
It was a variation of the theme with gox. You bought a btc from gox, they didn't have the Bitcoin but they lied and said they had it and marked you in a database to say you actually had a coin and then prayed to god you did not actually try to withdraw the phantom  coin. So they had far fewer coins in their wallet on the blockchain than what their database showed.

I don't believe this. The hedge funds were overwhelmingly long the futures contracts in Jan when bitcoin was crashing, and I believe that they still are. They weren't all wrong, they must have been hedging with long futures and short selling btc. They were driving the btc price down and probably still are.
You don't drive the price of btc down by buying short futures if you are trying to hedge a falling btc price as the miners may have done. That's prudent hedging but its not designed to drive the btc price down if you're a miner. If you are short selling btc to drive the price down, you hedge by buying long futures. In any case why would miners kill off their own business by willfully driving the price of bitcoin down or indirectly causing the price to fall ? Makes no sense.

 If you are short the market without a long hedge your upside risk is potentially unlimited. You'd better be hedged. Bitcoin futures allowed rampant shortingof btc that protected the upside. Before that you couldn't really short in size, unless you were suicidal

Bitcoin is better than gold. Btc has all the money properties of gold and two properties that beat gold, hands down. Storage and transfer, especially international transfer.  The storage part of gold is its Achilles heel. Large amounts of gold must be in secure , centralized vaults and that's where the hypothecation takes place. It's so important to get your btc into your own wallet. With large amounts of gold that is often not feasible to store it in your own vault due to the security risk, cost and transportation logistics.

The futures cover the btc short sellers risk of higher btc price. Long Futures will increase in value as price rises ,  with leverage. 
You buy a relatively low cost insurance using futures to protect(hedge) against the price moving up against your shorts. Then you borrow and sell short repeatedly making the btc price fall. The market volume is very low and so a big player with deep pockets eg. a bank, could fairly easily sell short repeatedly, driving the price down through technicals support levels triggering selling by others until it becomes a panic. They do have to eventually buy back but the damage may be so great that the price does not recover, or if it does their futures still protect them.
Of course , we have been through deep sell-offs before a fw times and recovered. Before though we never had futures and this sell off began almost to the day that the futures started trading and we were warned they would "tame the price".
 A dumb coincidence  ? Maybe. 
We shall see.
@_date: 2018-12-10 05:45:19
What may cause increased selling are miners, but not quite with the mechanism OP put. Miners always need to sell btc to fund their operations , even in a bull market, because all their income is in btc. But since their fiat costs are fixed or rising and when btc price is falling they have to sell more btc than previous to cover their fiat costs. It's a reinforcing cascade of selling more btc as btc prices fall. Nothing to do with the futures.
 If they are shorting futures it's to try limit their downside but that won't drive the btc price down. On cme futures btc coins are not involved at all. You don't need to borrow and return coins to anyone. That's just wrong. Shorting on futures you just buy a short future, you borrow nothing. Btc futures are settled in fiat cash.
I'd be very surprised if miners are shorting btc coins where you do have to borrow coins to sell and later buy back and return them.

"A large bitcoin exchange could tomorrow lend out 10,000 bitcoins to an individual to start a business.

The same amount of bitcoins would still exist in the Block Chain, but the body of people participating in the Bitcoin economy would have the perception that more bitcoins exist."

Not true. Your wallet and private keys can be offline at all times and by using an online watch-only wallet(no private keys in a watch-only wallet) you can send the transaction from the watch-only wallet after transferring the unsigned transaction to the offline wallet by usb , signing it with the offline private keys and then transferring the signed txn back to the watch wallet and sent. 
In other words, your private keys never have to be online, send or receive.
I think this is more secure than HW wallets, because you know for sure that your private keys are offline in a gapped, muted machine. With HW wallets, you have that only on trust, since the HW wallet is attached directly to the online machine. AFAIK

Banks create new money when they make a loan. New money from nothing that is interest bearing debt. In that sense there are no reserves. Reserves must be able to extinguish debt and that can only be done via debt free money. 
This entire fiat financial system is an exercise in swapping debt of different durations. It can never be extinguished.
 Bank loans that are repaid are supposed to be extinguished,  the money destroyed but then if all the loans are paid off money ceases to exist. In any case, interest+principle&gt; all money in circulation, it can never be paid off, especially with falling velocity.

a short seller borrows coin from an exchange sells it to someone else and now the guy you borrowed from(who hasn't a clue you borrowed it) and the guy you sold it to think they own the same coin.  Do that many times and you have multiple "owners" of the same coin. If they all do Proof of Keys day and before the short sales are bought to cover, we've got a problem. Ie.In aggregate, the open short sales come from a pool of keys (no owner has a allocated key, which is also a problem)and are equal to the amount of dual "owners" at that time. That number /2 will be the number of people that cannot get their keys on Keys day.
