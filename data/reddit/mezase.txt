Sell at 23k and miss 100k??? Dude...
@_date: 2018-09-07 05:47:57
These "news" didn't trigger the dump. Whales just milking that huge triangle on the daily
@_date: 2018-09-10 22:11:00
Bunch of idiots lmao
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:03:52
You do that
@_date: 2018-09-02 06:55:58
I think people would die for a 2nd opportunity to buy at 5k, that's why 5k isn't happening unless btc dies for real.
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:34:21
Lots of people do dude, and they mostly react to BTC since that's where the volume is

I have yet to see a falling wedge breaking immediately to the downside without at least breaking out upward first.
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:32:50
It's the banks buying cheap usd from the central bank hiking up its price and then selling it to the general public for a lot more. People buy high, central bank sells a lot of usd, price goes down, banks buy more, price goes up again, people panic and keep buying high.
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:24:23
It can be in a bear market, it just hasn't yet. The fact that you lost money doesn't mean it's a bear market.
@_date: 2018-09-05 02:32:23
Dude, a lot of people don't know anything about how bitcoin works. I had one coworker saying he didn't want to "open a Bitcoin account". And the guy's a friggin web developer lol

I'm not the one who lost money in this 9 month "bear market".

Go 100x leverage on Bitmex and you can turn those $2,000 into $50,000 really quickly
@_date: 2018-09-02 05:45:01
I set stop losses and it's not like I go 100% out of crypto just minimizing risks. If everything goes as planned I increase my amount of crypto or just lose some in the process. Not gonna bet on the $800 pumps, there's also the $800 dumps to take care of.
@_date: 2018-09-07 05:44:15
Lol losses, no losses if you already took out your initial investment and quite some profit ��
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:41:51
You see it in crypto, people love buying high. Make androids more "exclusive" and those idiots will buy that instead next time ��

If it's just the dns you could access it by IP address. Ask someone who can access it to ping it and give you the IP address
@_date: 2018-09-02 06:16:33
Yeah I'm bull mid/long term too, that's why I don't fear buying back in at the same price or just a little higher. But still one can never know I might just hit "the top" luckily and just watch everything go down for a few weeks again. My reason for being bull is that I feel those manipulating Bitcoin with news and price swings have finally bought enough at every 6k dip to finally let it go high enough before shorting again. The target? Who knows. Lots of stuff happening around crypto, definitely waaay better  positioned than in November so the bullrun is definitely happening before EOY.
@_date: 2018-09-10 22:46:13
5k is a dream
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:21:58
It's a great time to buy dude, don't mislead him with that garbage.
@_date: 2018-09-28 22:29:35
You get a refund it's not just a random exchange dude. They'll have to pay any losses back to their customers.

It's fun to watch how humans copy and ruin everything that's good, fucking simulation man
@_date: 2018-09-11 22:14:52
It's a pattern, whenever btc gets near 6k they're all like "DOOM, It's the end!" and after two weeks of up they are like"Btc to new highs" and it dumps. No point reading anything they put out, already should know better already.
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:48:58
How much you lost to call it a bear market? Nope, don't care either. It's too soon to call it a bear market buddy.
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:43:55
It all depends on when you bought, seeing that most people commenting bought around late december it figures that they're depressed and angry.
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:11:36
@_date: 2018-09-11 22:06:53
Until I really need the profits I made, in the meantime I'll trade.

Adoption bois! That's what today's pump was all about.
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:23:43
It went down after going up a friggin 2000%? Oh gee. It's relative, to me this is not a bear market.
@_date: 2018-09-04 13:43:31
I'm certain it will go up hard again before EOY
@_date: 2018-09-10 22:34:39
So you're bullish when bitcoin goes over 7k and bearish when bitcoin gets near 6k? You must have had a great year thinking like that
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:47:03
Based on a timeframe, if you look at the chart since the beginning of time we're still far far away from a bear market. If you bought at $100 you don't see a bear market. See what I mean?
@_date: 2018-09-03 22:59:30
Is that indicator on tradingview?
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:49:22
Don't buy jnto a 2000% run next time? LOL

You have got to put "100% real no fake" in the title, otherwise it's fake.
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:38:27
Nobody gives a shit about it, someone just sold a shit ton of crypto and people are looking for a reason.
@_date: 2018-09-02 08:12:24
If it ever went to $3 it means it died and nobody uses it, sure a bunch of people would run their nodes and whatnot but you know, no future anymore.
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:54:07
This is not good for Bitcoin, they aren't offering real btc, just derivatives
@_date: 2018-09-24 17:15:11
What a joke.
@_date: 2018-09-13 16:29:53
Yup, bulls brought it all the way up from $1 to 6k, is that bearish to you? You can only say it's a bear market if you bought somewhere above 10k srsly
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:24:12
Someone sold Bitcoins
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:33:44
Delete all the noise that happened this year and connect September 2017 and September 2018 (exactly one year), does that look like a bear market?
@_date: 2018-09-12 16:21:37

Lol a failure, being able to be your own bank does sound like too much freedom to most people
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:46:28
What's your plan? How high are you aiming? If you want to be independently financially independent like Carlos Matos you'll need to risk more
@_date: 2018-09-04 13:47:13
That's right bb
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:56:46
It's a correction for now if this thing goes on for two more years and no uptrends, sure call it a bear market. Truth is that bitcoin has been bouncing up and down the whole year you could make money both ways. Also remember btc was worth only 2k last year, did you really expect it to reach 50k in one go?
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:21:25
It's been bouncing up and down after that huge crash from 17k, you could make money both ways. Both bulls and bears got rekt if they stayed on the wrong side of the market.
@_date: 2018-09-07 16:43:30
Oh yes baby, jerk it
@_date: 2018-09-13 02:46:18
Truth is that if bitcoin goes up 25% most alts will go 200% from here.
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:56:55

@_date: 2018-09-27 22:57:29
Can't believe someone would actually buy something like Pigeoncoin. Well at least they have a logo ��
@_date: 2018-09-29 07:06:22
Too soon, makes no sense
@_date: 2018-09-13 16:56:06
If you somehow manage to live that long you will think like that too, don't you read what the 2011 hodlers say about btc and this "bear market"? They don't care, they're aiming higher and know how to zoom out. If those guys start getting worried you'll know you're in a real bear market.
@_date: 2018-09-09 07:28:14
Funny thing is that if bitcoin manages somehow to go up by 20%, many alts will go 150% and leave those btc gains in the dust.
@_date: 2018-08-20 03:15:16
Exactly, Bitcoin has now become a target for lots of institutional money. If enough gates are opened and they feel comfortable going in interesting things will happen before we know it.

@_date: 2018-08-27 12:48:30
Why are you still holding bcash though? You're missing on real alts starting their pump. Dump that crap and save yourself the guaranteed losses. Everyone knows about this bcash situation already.

It needs that kind of stuff since bitcoin is no longer $100. ETF will make it more valuable or rather not make it lose more.
@_date: 2018-08-22 22:23:07
It's just a really short term sell signal, doesn't really do anything. If you're actively trading you follow the signal and buy lower.
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:26:40
Shut up grandpa
@_date: 2018-08-24 12:38:52
SEC is actually trying to manipulate Bitcoin how ironic.
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:26:57
If you become a millionaire buying that high the rest will become trillionaires, doesn't sound right
@_date: 2018-05-15 05:51:18
And then 10k again
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:37:27
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:25:14
Yeah not everyone goes short. Also there's a line shorts won't be able to cross or the risk and amount of money involved to cross it far outweighs the reward. That's where the bounce is and nobody knows how high it will fly so again you don't short that.
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:14:34
He must be friends with many of those that don't want it to succeed
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:30:47
Dude, hodlers help other people. Imagine all these noobs panic selling at once? There'd be $1000 moves down in minutes on every dip.
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:12:13
Nigerian princes must be rolling in btc lmao
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:29:23
Dude trades on weed

I understand that, they don't. So let them.
@_date: 2018-05-06 02:05:33
If you get rich by just hodling that much, there will be a lot of people able to buy entire countries with their bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:03:38
It's no longer a bunch of nerds playing around with transactions, it's finally being taken seriously and this sort of thing will happen. If anything it will go up even stronger once bottom is in. Consider this an opportunity.
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:27:56
I'm bearish af on stocks right now, I'll just wait for it to crash and then go back in.
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:11:25

Lmao what a sorry excuse for a country
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:54:31
Dude, it's a perfect sell signal. Just sell and buy lower even if you're a hodler these signals are golden, you know everyone will be selling on this kind of stuff.

@_date: 2018-05-23 16:25:41
Lmao what a shitty article
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:00:27
Maybe some guys are done investing and are now having actual fun with their money lol
@_date: 2018-05-22 06:08:17
Sure, hodl all you want just don't buy 20k and decide to "hodl"
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:34:32
Who's this guy again?
@_date: 2018-05-21 05:15:02
Here you have the reason why btc pumped, people shorting bitcoin on margin asking to get rekt by mex
@_date: 2018-05-19 06:23:55
All good until people start losing their keys or getting hacked/scammed/phished and whatnot. Masses are still not ready to be their own bank.
@_date: 2018-08-29 12:06:22
20k is best
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:15:28
No banksters in that future
@_date: 2018-05-17 14:26:38
Yeah, like really memorized until you hit your head or something lmao.
@_date: 2018-08-12 04:49:50
Specially tight ones, exchange will create fake 8% wicks that last a second out of nowhere and trigger them. You'll either end up buying high or selling low for no reason.
@_date: 2018-08-15 00:54:50
Idiots shorting the blood lol
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:43:40
And people fall for this geez
@_date: 2018-05-16 04:44:32
There's enough bitcoin out there to bring it down to $1 in a few hours so...
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:51:01

Shhh don't say anything, they'll get mad.
@_date: 2019-03-26 05:07:44
In 5 years... dude loves to talk shit, doesn't he? Fiat's not going anywhere so soon. Unless you know, black swan.
@_date: 2019-03-01 23:16:05
So you just lost 10 BTC, lesson learned
@_date: 2019-03-24 04:06:03
It's a Bitcoin so... Nothing
@_date: 2019-03-14 03:21:22
You probably meant that most BTC was bought or mined before 2017 and most people bought after 2017, which is very different.
@_date: 2019-03-05 16:55:22
What's up with all these Satoshi symbol shitposts
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:50:24
It's the most useful/used coin of them all, even if its purpose is to lower fees to buy useless coins
@_date: 2019-03-06 22:42:20
Why do you think there's so many hodlers? They don't know who to sell it to
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:44:11
People still dreaming of lambos smh
@_date: 2019-03-20 02:17:22
Ummmmmmm you do know fiat goes into bitcoin and bitcoin into fiat, right?? Right??? Now what matters is whether whoever is buying Bitcoin actually wants it quickly and pay the full price or not.
@_date: 2019-03-14 03:06:37
Sure does look good, thing is that most people bought way above the current price. Meaning only a handful triggered that huge move up. We'll have to see what happens next to see if Bitcoin really does live up to everyone's expectations and keeps on moving upwards. It'd be nice to know that those who bought a hardware wallet haven't wasted their money.
@_date: 2019-03-22 20:30:30
Yeah... cause all that volume is 100% real. Ever dumped more than 20BTC?
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:16:43
Yup, thing is really fragile. There's a reason those -25% dumps happen so easily heh
@_date: 2019-03-15 22:03:17
@_date: 2019-03-18 16:01:08
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:30:39
You don't know that
@_date: 2019-03-24 06:24:49
Nobody knows wtf will happen it's really up to a couple guys to decide where it goes lol
@_date: 2019-03-25 05:53:35
Nice pornhub tab
@_date: 2019-03-20 03:30:17
Did you read my last line? Dude is talking as if the fiat used to buy Bitcoin disappeared out of this world.

Dunno but 6k is not a bad entry
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:39:07
Ever heard of consolidation??? It's literally about to blow up either direction most likely upwards.
@_date: 2018-10-11 22:18:25
Oh wait he's a "Dr."
@_date: 2018-10-24 22:23:45
I'd rather it stayed around 10k and 6k for a couple months before going to even higher highs. Need moar fuel to really start the rocket.
@_date: 2018-10-05 18:12:05
Moving millions where exactly? Don't be fooled by wash trading.
@_date: 2018-10-09 04:47:30
Are you able to buy and use dollars in Venezuela right now?
@_date: 2018-10-01 22:15:16
Can't imagine what would happen if Satoshi's coins moved, I'd expect one big ass drop tho
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:26:35
I can't wait to buy me some 50k Bitcoin and tell all my friends
@_date: 2018-10-04 13:51:24
Support is 0%
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:11:49
"than all the world's electric vehicles" wtf such an idiotic statement ��
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:29:22
How? Where??
@_date: 2018-10-06 04:21:51
Why would anyone use LTC nowadays or in the future? Its only advantage was being faster than bitcoin ages ago, there's no point to it anymore. Coinbase will be adding many more currencies so what you mentioned will be gone too. Dead enough?
@_date: 2018-10-09 23:00:15
See the 5.8k-6k support that's been holding throughout the entire year? That's institutions setting the floor.
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:18:31
It's very relevant. Had he been smarter he would not have bought on 20k. BTC is still very much up since last year lol
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:24:35
Yeah right, you know perfectly well that advertising something like that would make people try to buy high
@_date: 2018-10-26 01:17:27
Can I get the same explanation... but with apples?

@_date: 2018-10-17 04:19:27
Wow you actually typed all that shit, I wonder who's the idiot ��
@_date: 2019-03-18 06:09:35
His IQ must be over 9000!!
@_date: 2018-10-11 22:54:49
Is this satoshi?
@_date: 2019-03-18 06:26:58
Supposed to? It's vaporware, full stop.
@_date: 2018-10-07 18:42:58
Well that's because they wouldn't be able to move those funds easily and not get caught. Crypto on the other hand would be as easy as sending whatever they find to some address they own and poof.
@_date: 2018-10-19 23:09:29
Just like Maduro hates dictatorships

Sats. But again, it's still waaaay to early to start going for that angle. People still barely know you don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin or how it works at all lol
@_date: 2018-10-05 18:04:41

And sending them Bitcoin didn't make you question anything at all??
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:01:21
I believe most have already cashed out their initial investment, at least I did plus substantial gains so whatever lol. And you're really mistaken if you think there's no buyers left. Everyone's literally waiting to catch that sweet bottom.
@_date: 2018-06-09 06:30:11
Why are you talking about now? I don't expect anything to happen this year nor the next. It took a decade for bitcoin to become what it is right now. Give IOTA half the time and it will be so much more. As for companies you should already know who they're working with.
@_date: 2018-06-12 10:29:52
No one forces you to buy them, it's easy money who can blame them for it
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:25:22
Why so sure it will fall to 4k though, that's literally everyone's dream. Cheaper BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:36:37
So you didn't multiply your money like many of us did lmao what a loser

Or zero if it never gets there and you keep on waiting for it lol
@_date: 2018-06-17 09:53:00
Yeah why fall for that crap when they make easy millions off fees and listings, it wouldn't make any sense :p
@_date: 2018-06-09 09:03:44
Oh you're one of those moon kids, you know alts give you way more $$$ if you're not stupid. November felt like getting Bitcoin for $100 years ago lol

That's retarded, it is not how a market should work. Also the only reason you'd want it to go up is to take profits otherwise you wouldn't care about its price. You know you can short it, right?

They'll make money off transactions. And at that point there should be plenty of money in Bitcoin making it impossible for a couple guys to pump and dump like today, it will be stable. (Only if Btc really does fulfill every hodlers wish and adoption actually happens)

And why exactly should it go up again? Nobody ever gives any reasons as to why it should be X price. There's a huge amount of Bitcoins out there enough to flood the market and keep it down at $100 for years. Just look at 4k... there's not even a hint of a bounce.

Oops 2k broke, now it's sitting nicely on 1k and fighting. Bam $300, suddenly $1000 means 3x for those who bought at $300, still a huge bullrun but lots of people trapped maybe forever. Nobody knows what the fair price is on this new kind of asset.
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:54:01
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:32:38

You have to buy support, if it breaks you sell and buy next support. No need to buy and hold through a $1000 drop, nothing guarentees it will come back up and might just drop another $2000 and so on. If you think 5.8k-6k is bottom you buy there and sell if it breaks.

@_date: 2018-11-26 22:42:58
Retail is still hyped up thinking there's a bullrun right around the corner. It's been like this since the first time it bounced on 6k. Everyone is trying to get back all those "gains" they had in december. They're caught in some sort of gambling addiction, don't be like them.

@_date: 2019-01-24 22:27:17
Dunno it's a weird market, there's definitely many early buyers, who are today known as whales, that are still taking profit and will most likely keep selling hard whenever they get the chance. It's up to those guys to decide what the bottom is. The only reason Bitcoin isn't worth $300 right now is because they would rather grind it all the way down slowly. That's how much Bitcoin there is out there sitting around, unused, enough to keep it down for ages. It's not a joke when people say it's manipulated, they mean this very thing.

We are going down on a falling wedge and almost at the tip already.. 8k seems to be a huge resistance and even if it does give in the wedge's tip is above 7k.. that day will be glorious

Actually -15000 people who reported gains before drop will have to pay taxes
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:13:14
Think about this though. Everyone wanted it to go below 6k, yet when it did... Nothing, no buys. I expect the same pattern as 2018 to happen just a bit quicker. Unless Bakkt or ETF happens like I said, only something like that will give it some life. Otherwise 2k will happen for sure.
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:11:36
Yup, never used it like 99% of people on every crypto sub lol. Just here for the quick buck.

I'd rather have a more convincing bottom :(
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:45:09
It's not only in crypto dude it also applies to stocks and anywhere else where people blindly throw their life savings into stuff. Once they're down 99% and finally figure out that it's not going up ever again... They're likely to panic and do stupid things. The HODL meme might have ruined many but might also be keeping them alive. As long as they don't lose hope it's all good, we'll have to see what happens to crypto these following months.
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:29:07
Yeah you will be back alright, on next ATH
@_date: 2018-11-18 17:53:08
Why burning their fortunes? Didn't they create this BCH fork in order to keep their Bitcoins and spend BCH instead? Same with these two new recent forks. They've been literally doubling their BTC holdings with these scam forks...

Best thing one can do is to at least retrieve initial investment. I sleep so much better now lol. I went all in on iota on right before the massive crypto bull run last year so I did quite well but I also think it could've gone horribly wrong had I bought the top like a friend of mine did. He took his sweet time before putting in money, had he only listened to me that time was of the essence.. :'(
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:46:06
Ok happy hodling then, you don't need any sort of skills to do so. Keep buying all the dips and hope it works out for you.

If he needs to boast, clearly something is lacking. Good for him tho

What if many whales cash out? Crash or slow bleed out can really happen without notice
@_date: 2019-01-25 15:09:14
Would you spend 20BTC "knowing" it will be worth more in the future and if you were to buy those 20BTC back you'd have to pay commissions along the way?
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:38:50
Very scary and I see people going long and not selling even if it drops at 11k... Nuts
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:15:18
Yeah imagine you had 800BTC, now bitcoin is in a critical position about to break up/down. If you want it to go down all you have to do is sell a bunch, wait below and feed.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:42:38
It's a correction... I wouldn't be surprised if bitcoin ends up around 5-6k before going bull again
@_date: 2018-02-19 06:13:36
This dude sells &gt; market follows &gt; another crash
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:33:54
You don't buy tops guys, specially next to the 12k resistance...
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:44:03
Same here, crypto can crash really really fast. I believe tether will be next catalyst. I'm seriously thinking of cashing out into fiat until that thing is done with

If you bought in december, sure. Try not to buy the top next time thx
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:56:09
Surely one more dip before that

I don't say it will be different, I'm saying that it could be different and if all you do is hodl without giving a fuck it might end badly. Hopefully btc reach new highs, I'd like nothing better but I'm not gonna let cash just sit there and hope for the best

@_date: 2018-12-12 22:51:34
This along with tether really makes you wonder if there's a market at all going on here. Bitcoin wouldn't have gone past 1k ever without this bot and the fake buys just smashing through each and every possible dump point. I saw something similar happening on February after the 6k bounce. Price going up in a wedge ready to fall and the BAM million dollar pump for no reason. It's been nice knowing you Bitcoin/crypto.
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:48:12
Only american sheeplings pay taxes on crypto
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:54:27
Do you know how much Bitcoin is being bought on exchanges and how much is actually being withdrawn? What about forks? What about every other coin out there that does pretty much the same thing as Bitcoin? Also read up on what happened during the Mt. Gox era it might give you a clue to what happened during this unbelievable run to 20k.
@_date: 2018-12-14 05:04:49
All I know is I can buy almost three times the amount of Bitcoins now thanks to these nifty stablecoins. I'd feel real sad at the moment had I hodled through all this amazing shitshow. So don't fall for the hodl meme, it's just a meme.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:20:21
That's awesome news so glad to hear that! Also it will surely become cheaper over time.
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:35:55
As if Bitcoin had any liquidity lol.
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:17:54
40% inflation AND 50% devaluation against the US dollar this year alone. If you had ARS in the stock market you got rekt, the only way you could have survived is being pretty much 100% in USD before january 2018. Luckily I did just that along with Bitcoin gains :3
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:54:51
Not really this makes things even worse for there's never been a "fair value" to bitcoin. It's been fake pumped since the beginning. I would not be surprised Bitcoin heading sub 1k next year. Huge fake bubble.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:16:05

@_date: 2018-12-28 02:54:33
You mean breaking through support lines lol
3k is last support, else see you all sub 1k.
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:41:43
I'm not buying into a falling asset just to prove a point. If anything this will create some sort of pump (I don't expect it to) and people will just try to make some profit. The days people were "in it for the tech" and fundamentals are long gone. Also if everyone did that on the same day the network wouldn't be able to handle it and exchanges would take their sweet time to make the deposits creating panic.
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:02:36
How do we know those numbers are real? If so what about wash trading? We all know about the fake volume on exchanges. Is anyone making sure all of those transactions are real?
@_date: 2018-12-12 05:33:25
Yeah man, hodl while market keeps dumping on you.
Next bull run: $200 -&gt; $1200.

You actually hodled all the way down from 20k and never took profit? You are the... gains antithesis ��
I just can't imagine losing 90% of my money in a year lol

@_date: 2018-12-12 23:38:16
So Willy and fake buys might have been all Jed's doing while he dumped on some other exchange for real cash? Has Jed been included in the investigation?
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:44:30
20k is looking like the ultimate bull trap. Most likely pumped by bitfinex (along with other shady groups). And now with the SEC poking around looking for those behind sketchy practices they're sure to be careful and avoid that kind of crap again. Also these guys must have made HUGE returns last year.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:23:41
You're delusional if you think they can't control the price of something like Bitcoin. They've done it to all kinds of assets and it won't be any different this time.

I did that's why I took the rest of my profits when 5.8k broke. Not going to "hodl" to the titanic like all the delusional kids in here.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:52:23
Bitcoin is 10 years old, not the beginning at all. We all know there's huge amounts of Bitcoin out there still waiting to be sold for profit taking. And let's not rule out all these january 2018 hodlers who are just begging for an opportunity to get even and cash out whatever they put into this market. The way up will be really tough without actual institutional money pumping it. Last run was definitely shady groups manipulating price and pumping non stop. If there's a chance for Bitcoin it's Bakkt and ETF approval, both are huge buy signals and market will most likely react.
@_date: 2018-12-14 04:15:45
Oh you're "in it for the tech", good for you :D

Y u so mad lil guy? Did you lose that much money??
@_date: 2018-12-14 04:40:59
Sry to tell you I didn't lose a single dime since I took out my initial investment and some sweet profits back in February so it's all green for me. Went pretty much full tether when 5.8k broke and I'm just waiting for the trend to change if it ever does. For the moment all I see is hodlers in pain hoping for someone to pump their bags. Bubbles are a real thing bud and you're witnessing it first hand.

All fun and games until you see it break 1k next year.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:15:53
You don't know if you will win yet. It really might head sub 1k and die a slow death. Or maybe bounce around $300 and 2k for years before dying or mooning to 10k only to die again.

Only in hindsight, each one of them bought the top. Think about that it could've ended badly for any of them just like the new 20k hodl gang.
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:41:50
Because they want to increase their fiat holdings by dumping on you. Nobody really cares about Bitcoin and what it offers, they just want a better car or shit like that.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:18:25
Go all in bro
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:38:32
You're comparing a country to a pump and dump currency? Euphoria phase still no over apparently... Everyone so hang up on that 20k run geez
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:21:04
If Bitcoin booms again many others will boom five times as much
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:03:13
Did you take profit tho? That's all that matters
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:26:09
Come back in 5 years and cry lol
@_date: 2018-12-15 23:21:24
Not really but people want dumb shit and easy money you know this
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:26:26
I understand but I'd have to untether to move those funds, not gonna happen. I'm not one of those who plans on riding crypto to zero if they have to.
@_date: 2018-12-15 23:25:40
And there's even more Bitcoin out there to sell no worries
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:27:55
The system on which the currency moves might be decentralized but all of the major exchanges are centralized. When you buy and sell "Bitcoins" on their systems it's nothing more than entries in a database that mean nothing. If everyone was to withdraw their "Bitcoins" right now there'd definitely be a lot of exchanges closing down since they do not really have that many Bitcoins. Mt. Gox was just the beginning.

Not a bubble ��
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:55:59
While you buy and HODL, whales SODL while it's still above 3k.
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:27:05
There's probably only a couple exchanges with real volume, the big ones. Worst thing that can happen is a couple guys losing all their coins because of trading on really shitty exchanges. Also I doubt people will actually move their coins off exchanges.
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:27:28
Not really dude you're just plain wrong. If bitcoin is going up you do not want to be in Bitcoin. If it goes down you do not want to be in crypto at all. Whatever works for you tho you sound like one of them hodlers. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:35:06
Dude just wanted to see how far he could pump bitcoin. Seriously though what an idiot. By now he'd be a billionaire with no legal issues just by taking commission on every trade.
@_date: 2018-12-16 20:33:46
Profit taking? Too much supply, no more buyers? Bad news? Mt gox thingy?
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:25:30
Is internet easily available to Cubans on the island?
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:39:45
Yeah well I'm not talking about low volume shitcoins man, any of the top 20 do it pretty much all the time, you don't really have to think too much.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:17:28
Now we need perma-bull Tom Lee to say Bitcoin is going nowhere lol
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:38:47
Umm no... I'm not buying into a falling asset just to prove a point. Whoever wrote this doesn't have more than $100 in crypto and is no older than 20 yrs old or just wants someone to pamp his bags to make their exit.
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:08:32
Buying alts during november was the smartest thing I've ever done, so? What's your point? It's all about timing, there is no such thing as being smart by just buying.
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:00:45
You will just get dumped on while you're at it.
@_date: 2018-12-22 05:18:18
I'll pm you one you can use 100% secure.
