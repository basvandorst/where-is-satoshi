What? Why?  Especially if it's a trusted US VPN.  I have had zero problems VPNing into Coinbase.  I did accidentally VPN into my account from the wrong country before and ended up with a foreign transaction fee.  My bad.

That's a long time to wait.  How about a moon?  When can I have just that for my 1 BTC?
@_date: 2017-02-12 03:14:25
Yea but what are the fees?  Coinbase is actually not too bad if coming from a bank account.  ATM's are usually several times higher.

He is asking an honest question about BTC.  This is r/bitcoin.  I dont see an issue with it.
OP,  if this is your first purchase YOUR BANK may be the issue.  Coinbase purchases can trigger fraud protection after just one purchase.  You may need to call the number on the back of your card and confirm that the purchase is valid.
@_date: 2017-02-03 23:12:42
They are both S curves but BTC upper bound is probably sooner than that of data storage density.   So we are not likely to outpace the growth of storage.  I mean look at the magnetic media sizes available now.  It's getting really cheap.  Heck even 1TB USB flash drives are going to be out in volumes quite soon.
@_date: 2017-02-14 03:13:48
I get free roaming data in JPN so I would have likely done the same.  What do you do in Japan that you need to buy BTC on a US exchange?  If you have a work visa you should be able to open an account in Japan after 90 days correct?
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:07:56


See, that's the problem.  IMO the cost per transaction is already a little high.  This is especially true in 3rd world countries where BTC is really needed due to hyperinflation.  The spamming IS causing TX costs to go up because people are choosing higher fees to guarantee it will go through.
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:40:30

BTC exchanges are typically regulated by country.  Additionally, if you buy using a credit card or debit from an exchange in a different country than the card is from you will be charged a foreign transaction fee.  In the case of some of the exchanges they operate in several countries.  So, if you come in with the wrong IP they either will not allow the transaction or may process it as if it were originating from the country indicated by your IP address.  To the exchange it's no big deal but to you, when you get your statement at the end of the month it may be a surprise.  I suggest you either use a bank account or VNC into a US exchange.  Also, don't keep your money on the exchange.  Buy/sell, then transfer out.

Doubtful.  The IRS can't track buy and sells or determine long and short gains since the security is not a constant.  It's like saying I bought TSLA at $200 but then sold back NVDA at $250.  It doesn't work like that.  Especially if you are sending the coins off the exchange to hold the private key.
Coinbase can't and won't provide this service.  Welcome to the legal gray area fuck zone.
@_date: 2017-02-02 19:07:57
There are vulnerabilities.  I have faith that the tech can outpace the attacks.  The problem that I see is that the wallets and indeed the whole ecosystem are too tough for joe smoe to understand.  Especially with things denominated in $ and needing to be converted into BTC.  It scares the public and its too much work for most to dig into without being taught.
We need much better and simpler wallet tech before we can go cashless.

That's a poor analogy.  The laws are severely in favor of women when it comes to marriage.  If you wanted to be more accurate you would say that all men are required to drive cardboard cars with no safety equipment but women all get Volvo SUV's.
Even if things were perfect for me with my family life, I don't think I would have ever gotten married if I had known just how one sided the laws are.  Thinking of it from a business perspective... Why the hell would anyone who is the more financially secure be willing to risk losing the majority of his wealth for an arrangement that is 50% likely to fail!?
@_date: 2017-02-05 02:51:49
I would think they would do something like imputed income.  Where the state basically assumes either you have money or are purposefully avoiding declaring income to win a better judgement.  You had better be able to prove that that money was spent/lost.
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:24:41
I see what you did there.
@_date: 2017-02-05 02:48:47


The distrust comes after marriage.  In my case I found out my wife had $50k in defaulted student loans after we had a kid.  Now, she won't do shit anymore.  No cooking, no cleaning, wont take care of her daughter.  Lucky for me I let her convince me to sell the house I owned before we got married and we moved to a community property state.  Now I'm stuck with a fucked up house that I can't sell because she trashed it. Also, she is on the deed even though her name is not on the mortgage since I live in a community property state and we didn't want her wrecked credit killing the mortgage rate.  People do fucked up stuff.  Don't get married if you are a man, EVER.  It's not worth the risk.

It's more akin to playing a game of whack a mole.  Every time some govt stomps on BTC it pops up stronger somewhere else.  It's like friggin kudzu.  If BTC were to crash altcoin would be in big trouble.

Yes.  I live in a big city.  I probably have 50 banks/credit unions within 10 min.  I use my big nationwide bank as my master account.  The smaller bank is used for BTC transfers.  Again it slows things by 24 hrs but at least it gives me peace of mind.

Ok, well I don't understand at all then.  How can they have code running and signaling BU in blocks but the code be incompatible?  It obviously works for the current consensus format.  I agree if BU format blocks were issued they would be regected.  Point is their mining software can function within the current structure.  I'm not arguing for them but I really do think we need more variety in the nodes at least.  Take the BU crash as an example.  If a similar bug were to exist in core and no BU nodes existed, the whole network would be down.
@_date: 2017-02-17 00:23:27
I think you are wrong.  If they have a digital currency it will be easier to ban Bitcoin.  This is not good news.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:13:55

I am not weighing buy's based on current price.  I am looking to improve my cost of holdings by purchasing in dips but my goal is several years out.  I am thinking that I will start spending the same amount I buy during the Tokyo Olympics.  So projections tell me BTC is still quite cheap for me at the current prices.  If you are looking at short term profit you are just gambling given the volatility of BTC.

@_date: 2017-02-02 19:12:49
Nice!!  However, he is right.  Unfortunately one of the hedges against automation is to own production capacity.  The easiest way to do that is with stocks.  BTC while a decently performing speculation is not a dividend generating investment.  If the price were to finally stabilize your ROI would be locked in and you would not earn additional returns as you would with a revenue generating company.
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:39:14
I thought that was the intention.  Hence the limited number of shares.  They could theoretically issue more shares to dilute the value of existing ones or purchase more BTC to issue more shares at the same value. FWIW they did purchase a huge number of BTC.

@_date: 2017-03-16 12:21:17
Well, the numbers don't lie.  The miners are still showing the same percentages.  Segwit signaling has changed maybe by a whopping 1% since the attack.  This feels like a civil war to me.  I understand the market determination principles of Bitcoin but a protracted stalemate is going to do neither side any good.  If end users lose confidence in Bitcoin as the "digital gold" standard it may never return.  Look at the altcoins in the last 24 hrs!!!

@_date: 2017-03-08 21:22:12
Transaction costs making the currency too expensive to adopt generally.  This is especially true in the 3rd world for small transactions.
Block size limit looks like it will have to scale faster than hardware.  This will mean less full nodes and more centralized processing due to the massive storage that will eventually be required.  This is closely tied to transactions per second and imposes an upper limit of the number of transactions that can be processed in a given time.  It is currently quite low when compared to other networks (VISA for example).
Finally, no regulation means manipulation of price (both in fiat and cost per transaction) is possible and probable.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:56:23
Wow, totally missed what's going on.  But, that's ok.  It means that if the block cap gets sorted Redditers will have a lead at buying the dip.

I like how you did that.
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:18:58
I think the non reaction of the price was due to the complexity of the issue.  Bitcoin worked just fine during the disruption so the reporters couldn't make clickbait out of it too easily.  
What is going on with the Nodes though.  It looks like we have added &gt;400 nodes since the crash and patch of BU.    I find it hard to believe that the network increased the total node count by 6% in a matter of hours.
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:05:55

@_date: 2017-03-15 17:43:08
I am highly concerned about this.  It is quite apparent to myself that the transaction costs and slow confirmations are the direct cause of the altcoins gaining value.  With all the capital sunk into ASIC hardware it would be a disaster for the mining folks businesses to allow the value of other non hardware compatible coins to continue to increase in value.  They had better fix the issue before momentum is built in the alts.  A year ago I would have never considered other coins.  But, here I am today already spreading my investment across several.

Go ahead and ban my exchange.  All it will do is annoy me and further my resolve to work outside of the current monetary system.  It may slow us down some but a change like that will just make the use of virtual currency much harder to track.
@_date: 2017-03-12 03:53:35
Huh, that is a very interesting way of thinking about it.  I never considered high fees as a rate control on adoption.  I guess I thought of it like the mining costs were going to kill adoption but you are right, it would just slow adoption.  It could be viewed as a feedback loop that throttles adoption until innovations are made in the code allowing for higher transactions per second.
@_date: 2017-03-12 03:36:21

Actually, I'll admit I voted with my coins by shifting a lot out.  Something had to be done to get their attention.  Hitting them in the income revenue stream by dropping the value of BTC is a damn good way to do it and if it doesn't work well I can bring a few nodes online to try the UASF.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:59:31
Yes we do.  That's why we are here talking.  We care about Bitcoin.  It has security that is superior to alts but other issues are making it difficult to use and the costs for transactions with just a few inputs are not in line with the original vision I was sold.
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:18:35

@_date: 2017-03-16 14:01:41
Yea, even with all the infighting in Bitcoin and the language divide the numbers don't lie.  The guys mining will notice the flow of value from their currency to others.  Too much money invested in the hardware to allow the price of BTC to fall.  They will need to act soon or become unprofitable.  This raises an interesting question.  
From what I understand the margins on mining are quite thin even at scale.  If the price of BTC were falling because of transaction backlogs could hash power fall?  If it did can the difficulty reduce to allow for less mining and maintain the 10m block cycle?
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:53:00

This pisses me off!  Technology has always progressed toward the use of more energy per individual.  Indeed the quality of life has a direct correlation with one's energy consumption.  When we were hunter gatherers we had the energy of a spear thrown or a rock dropped.  When we harnessed animals for pulling things we had 1-8 HP.  When we came up with steam the amount of power an individual could command went up again.  Then internal combustion etc.. etc.. maybe eventually fusion.  The point is that increased energy utilization is not bad for society.  Burning coal to get it, well that is another story.

I read the title and thought the same thing.  Since when have you needed to be compliant to do barter trade before.  If BTC is not a currency (as the IRS has stated) then this is barter trade.

A fork would be rough in the short term but this needs to happen ASAP.  The longer the stalemate lasts the higher the atl market cap.  BTC risks being forgotten by the media if Etherium overtakes it.  Some of you may laugh but look at the price and volume trends of Etherium since BTC reached the transaction capacity limit.
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:26:09
Nope, too many of us waiting in the wings for that to happen.  Our buy orders are way higher than that.
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:41:34
Network effect is deceptive.  I suspect swings between leading coins at this point in history can happen quickly.  Everything looks like exponentials and steep S curves.  If the market decides to switch to ETH it will be quicker than many expect.  Remember, no infrastructure change just a few clicks in an app for many users to switch.  The smug attitude and hubris around Bitcoin as the leading coin could end up being the ultimate cause of the loss of it's leading status.
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:34:02
I sure hope so.  I hope CB factored in the withdrawals that they are seeing before making that announcement. I am actually surprised they gave people so much time. I however am stuck with an ETF going into CB before I saw the announcement.  It is supposed to clear the day before the fee change.  So I guess I will be the worst case test.

Exactly.  For example quite a few will give you a static IP.  If that's your thing.  You can even open up a static account and a regular random hop account so you can run a node and also surf with a slightly more secure connection.

If they have a client and currently produce blocks on the same chain it technically is producing valid Bitcoin blocks.  It's like two browsers both parsing regular HTML.  One may be capable of handling HTML-5 the other not.  They both manipulate a standard page the same way.  It's just like Segwit and BU.  Both are working on the current consensus block rules.  So, both are currently bitcoin until a clear winner comes out and the data structure is modified.
My question was why did the total node count increase by 6% even though not all BU nodes had been restored yet.  
Edit:  I guess I could take it one step further and ask why the node count rises and falls periodically?
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:56:30
Thanks for summing up.  So if the change is made to Casper then the core development group of Ethereum would essentially become just another company (or group of companies) issuing currency.  Like the banks in the old west.  Seems to me this would be corrupt and easily acquired/absorbed by a government.

I agree with your statement entirely.  I moved a large swath of BTC over to ETH before the most recent bump in price.  I will wait for good news on the BTC scaling front before I am willing to sink a lot more value into it.  Don't get me wrong I still have plenty of BTC but I am being forced to diversify my crypto holdings.

What?  You want to own as many coins as possible regardless.  There is a risk of a fork with two, long lasting chains.  If it scares enough people it could damage both BTC and the altfork value for a considerable time.

Compared to VISA debit or a bank transfer... it sure as hell is!  Remember that the bank take the funds out of your account instantly but the merchant or receiver definitely does not have the funds show up in any sort of reasonable time.  Sometimes it can be many days later for them.
Another example:  I sold some stock recently and asked about having the cash wired to my bank account.  They said sure it will be $35 USD and it will be in your account by the close of business many hours later.  I laughed at the banker and told him to cut me a check.  I got the impression that he knew how ridiculous the slow/expensive wire transfer was.

Of course an ATM is an option but that has a premium and transaction limits.  What if I want to deposit or withdraw a couple grand?  Everyone talked up Kraken and after getting through the first few verification's the system basically says the funding methods are no longer available in the US and the next level is required.  Total BS.  Who would give this kind of info to an online exchange?

So you surmise that it is indifference of the gov't due to the newness of the currency?  I can see that.  But, BTC IS on the radar of the bankers and the politicians are notorious for being in their pockets.  I expected far more resistance.  Even the talking points have shifted and the media is behaving more like bitcoin is a financial tool.  It really makes me wonder if some of those in power are starting to see BTC as a failover currency for fiat and have established positions themselves.  This would explain what I perceive as quiet on the regulation side.

@_date: 2017-01-03 01:37:09
I'm confused and maybe you can explain.  I thought the transactions per second were limited to about 7.  But, when I look at blockchain I see its been about half that for a while.  Is there a reason we have not pegged the transaction limit long ago?

Bitcoin is not technically a currency under the dictionary definition.  It would have to be issued by a central authority.  So, they are technically correct.  That does not mean it is not a means of capital transmission.
@_date: 2017-01-03 14:32:38
I agree with you fully that a ban is extremely easy to work around.  But the ban/s are exactly what i am talking about.  They are a reaction to the risk posed by BTC.  The fact that there is no strong or negative reaction in the US is what I am curious about.

I still see an upward trend at almost any period.  FYI January comes before March.  (100/250*260)-100 = 4% increase in transactions in just a few months.  The # of transactions needs to increase.  A reduction in the transactions per day rate would indicate the currency is being used less to many investors and would cause a crash.
@_date: 2017-01-03 14:40:44

Wow!  &gt;40K and you are willing to pay the fees they impose!  Man, I feel your pain.  But, for that kind of purchase I suppose it is the most secure way to handle international buyers.  A 5KUSD order would be fairly routine for some companies.  Seems like they need a software update.  Well, if you wait a few more years maybe the problem will be solved by BTC.  I am hoping Japan will show us the way before 2020.

For the most part yes.  You can easily find locals who are buying and selling bitcoin with USD in the USA.  This is in higher populated areas.  Try using localbitcoins.com to see if there is anyone near you.  If you want some added transaction security Mycelium wallet has a great buying and selling feature to help coordinate local sales.  Also, in major cities there are BTC ATM's.  Walk up, insert cash, scan code and done.  Limits vary but most will take several hundred dollars in a deposit.  Beware, you are using an ATM.  Check your surroundings first!
@_date: 2017-01-06 23:32:09
BTC won't make police go away.  If they can't monitor your income they will just tax the shit out of your house, car etc....  If you don't pay the police show up with their guns and tell you that your house is now the property of the state.  Not much you can do against today's militarized police force in the US.  You will still have to pay taxes.  Even if hiding some of your income becomes slightly easier.

I guess this is sort of a noob question but wouldent all inputs tend to be fragmented smaller and smaller over time?  Eventually making bitcoin dust with an infinite number of bits required for the transaction since each coin is broken up smaller and smaller after each transaction that has change?

I would be VERY nervous about that if i were a company owner.  Given what happened in India as an example, denomination elimination would be a real concern.  There's no real good hedge here.  Even BTC is risky.
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:07:46
It clearly states how long it will be before they deposit.  Also, there is a delay from when your bank shows it pulled to when it's actually available to Coinbase.  Typically this is about three business days but can be as long as 5.  
They have to deal with the fiat banks and slow transfers on their end.  Once money is in their system I have never seen anything take more than 60 seconds.  I bet you it's the interface with your bank that is slowing things especially if you are dealing with close to 10KUSD.
Edit: can't spell worth shit!
@_date: 2017-01-17 19:45:56
The coinbase trust system is setup for progressive purchases.  A buy of $775 may have tripped their automatic trust model.  
I have been using CB for a while and always made progressively larger purchases.  Also, never made a second purchase before the first one cleared.  Over time their system has given me larger and larger buy and sell limits.  I think this is a fair way to protect the users and the company.  People give CB a lot of shit but it's a unique system for protecting customers.

Well,  I have a pending deposit too.  Funds came out yesterday so we will see.  I placed the buy on Jan 7th and it took 4 days for the funds to be withdrawn from the bank.  That is very slow for an EFT.  I am really surprised since they should want to get the cash in hand ASAP so they can make money on the interest before they make it available at Coinbase.  
Since it is taking a while for them to actually withdraw funds I don't yet suspect something fishy.  It may just be repercussions of the recent bubble and high trading volume slowing things down.  I hope I am right.  This is why I stick to numerous small transactions.  Keeps me less nervous.
@_date: 2017-01-23 02:36:10

@_date: 2017-01-30 15:18:51
It is very smart of them to put the fee only on businesses.  That way the pressure will by applied indirectly.  Today its 1%, a year from now 3% then 10% to the point where companies won't accept cash anymore.  The plebs may not blame the gov't outright.  I think this will be especially effective if they ramp the fee slowly.
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:10:59
I know what you mean.  The initial learning curve is steep for the average person.  Enough so to scare many off.  Once they see other people using it though hopefully things will change.
@_date: 2017-01-03 20:59:10
Yes..... but the currency is being used as a vehicle to move between fiats.  It has utility and is spendable at quite a few big retail locatoins.  I have very little coin and hence really no skin in the game.  I have been buying and using it for purchases in the hopes that more retailers will accept it.  My main apprehension is the block limit.  Segwit is not the answer since the initial transaction still requires the confirmation time and is not technically closed (settled) until someone closes the channel.  So, there are still issues with widespread adoption.  At worst BTC is a financial tool.  If the devs and miners can get their shit together it could become the world currency.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:17:00

@_date: 2017-01-09 15:12:45
An interesting idea.  A dynamic block would be useful for scaling.  I have always thought an arbitrary change to the block size would cause a shock to the pricing system.  This would allow for more smooth transaction rate ramping during global adoption but also allow for the cost per transaction to spike during abnormal events (see India).  The mining community would probably like that portion of your idea.  I don't think segwit is the ultimate solution even if it does have some interesting capabilities.  
I'm all for a dynamic block with proper controls.  But, this needs to be considered carefully because there are obviously huge implications for getting the structure wrong.
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:34:38
Relaxing..... ok, better.  By my math it is still a buy since I am looking at the big picture 10+ years out.  But, it does suck to buy in at the peak of one of the bubbles.

That would make it look less shady to an agent.  You could explain, this is the account number and these are the dates of the transactions.  Tracing that around through multiple addresses would be a PITA.  If I were one of the first hodlers I may consider leaving it like this to complete my capital gains when its time.  That much money though.  I think I could pay someone to do the paperwork.

Yea, I had not heard of accounts being frozen due to proximity of certain addresses.  In any event, Coinbase would not be freezing YOUR coins since once you pass them to the exchange the coins are under the control of the exchange.  I.E. they are no longer yours.  If you don't send them to the exchange there is absolutely no way they can keep the miners in china and distributed across the world form allowing their movement.  They would all have to agree not to process those addresses.  In other words, not going to happen.

I think you are missing the point.  Checking ID is good but logging is kinda sketchy.  Especially since the ID# on the account did not match the one I gave them.  One would have expected that to throw a flag for security reasons.  Alas he only cared about logging the ID number.  
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:52:52
Interesting..  so you are suggesting using ASIC hardware as a load bank?  The problem with this is that it implies that the mining hardware would be turned off during peak times.  This could lead to extremely long ROI on the hardware since it would only be running a portion of each day.  Even at cost for a large cogen natural gas plant ~$0.04 you would probably be doubling the ROI period for the hardware.

If I were running a very small government.  Say, an island with no income tax it may make sense to declare Bitcoin the national currency.  That is for a VERY small population nation.  I think it could happen but no large nation will willingly accept the forced transition.  Some will regulate, some will ban but none will be able to kill it off.  Banning it IMO is futile bit will slow down adoption.  I think BTC will have a place alongside national currency but it will be much longer than most oh here hope before it becomes the world reserve note.  A very long time!  The reason.  BTC is harder to use than swiping a card and people are lazy as hell.
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:12:11
This does actually bring up an interesting point. I don't think that the government could shut it down in China.  But, they may be able to effectively isolate the Chinese miners from the rest of the world network.  A sort of hardware fork I guess would occur via the great firewall.  I'm probably just talking out of my ass though.
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:39:02
I wish everyone would stop talking about China.  BTC price was too hot.  I.E. way above what the reasonable appreciation should have been given the rate of user adoption.  The Chinese just caused a lot of the speculation to stop and we snapped back to reality.  If you smoothe the price curve of the last two years BTC should be priced just below $900 today.   Obviously everyone has their own projections but even a straight line rather than a poly fit would give most projections at less $'s than the current market price.  China just popped the bubble.  I think we are seeing close to true price based on utility right now.

Nobody in the engineering industry sees them as anything other than a standards verification house.  They serve as the master for temperature, pressure, weight, flow, etc.. measurements.  Most US labs trace our measurement standards back to NIST.  This helps confirm that we are all working from the same exact amounts of each thing.  This is highly critical in commodity custody transfers.  Millions upon millions are on the line in some cases.  So, you can bet there is a LOT of financial trust in NIST.

True.  But over time there will be a LOT of records of purchases from them.  The rate isn't bad from them but it sure is a nice easy list of users.  I was wondering if users had started diversifying their buying / selling in response to some of these actions.
Also, I thought some folks on here had already experienced temporary freezes of their USD bank accounts when selling large volumes of coin.  That's not the fault of Coinbase but obviously a large inconvenience until you explain where the funds came from sufficiently that the bank releases your money.

The price support says otherwise.  You may actually see more funds flowing in because FOMO and lack of access through an ETF.  If enough folks dumped stocks as a result of the decision the price should start to rise as early as Friday next week through Wednesday the following.  Just a random uneducated guess though.

Then why not always check ID?  What bothers me is not the verification of my ID.  It's the logging of my ID for cash transactions incoming or outgoing as if it were suspicious.  Again,  the ID on the account did not match the ID I gave them and there was no issue so I know it was not for security purposes.  I even asked him if he was updating the account info and he said no.

The IMF and the US government have decided to regulate and monitor exchanges and transfers to and from fiat accounts.  I read a posting here with an IMF report that basically admits they have no capability to monitor things once BTC becomes much larger and transactions don't pass back to the fiat system.  They mention shifting enforcement to the miners but they may have a tough time doing that.  One of the big concerns they had was the fact that governments would not cooperate with each other enough to effectively regulate any part of the network.  
I think what you are likely to see is a big shift to property tax etc..

Well, it depends on your investing view.  IMO there is a slight potential that this is just the start of a huge run up and it will never reach this price again.  I don't think that is the case but there is a possibility.  I think it is too early and we don't have enough popular mindset capitalization for this to be the big BTC adoption people are hoping for.  I am not seeing the retail acceptance announcements that should occur with the broad global currency adoption that I would expect.  Not enough people even know what BTC is about.  When 10-25% of the populace says "I have heard of Bitcoin" that's when the explosion will happen.  If you think this is a big spike, just wait!

I have not paid much attention to the conspiracy theories but that is a fun one!  I suppose on a nation state level an attack could be carried out on all network nodes slowly degrading the network as a state electronic currency is introduced.  Thereby causing a nervous populace to adopt the state coin.  That's a bit far fetched though.
So, to sum up what I have read so far we have the following reasons for the government tolerance of bitcoin;
Indifferent due to BTC market cap being comparatively small.
Unaware of the potential risk to established power base.
Those in power already hodl BTC positions.
The gov't currently has no way to stop BTC so would rather it be in the open for monitoring.
Satoshi was a secret government project ;)
I think some combination of the first three make the most sense.

True but I use this account just for Coinbase transactions.  The odd thing is that when there is a large amount of fiat in the account and the withdrawal is only a small fraction of the balance, the EFT posts as pending quickly.  When the balance is lower and the withdrawal is a large percentage it is delayed.  This has happened enough times that I could easily give 10:1 odds on if the EFT will go pending the same day or 2+ days later.

@_date: 2017-01-04 21:27:27
Unless you have one large fiat to BTC buy I don't see how you could do the same.  They would want to know where each amount of BTC came from, what the date was and what the purchase price was and you would need to know the transaction costs as well on both ends.

Great point!  So, in theory places like Venezuela may actually be looking at a financial boom in time due to early bitcoin adoption.  An interesting prospect indeed.

Interesting.  I had not considered that deposits would also shift the value since that store would effectively remove the coins from circulation.  That would constrain supply and push the price per unit up appropriately.  This raises an interesting question though.  In banks, those deposits are actually returned to the economy through loans.  So, you are correct since this is adding to the effective total currency in circulation.  But, what impact would this have on the economy if everyone shifted their savings from fiat to coin?  Banks could not loan money unless they started paying a decent interest to bitcoin depositors.  Given the depreciating nature of bitcoin I would think that loans would get very expensive!
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:30:47
If you are asking this question in this way you need to do WAY more research.  The ROI is quite low for a small system in developed countries.  Economies of scale are where the big money is especially where electricity is cheap.  I have done the math and a mine would be feasible if I had access to commercial/industrial power rates in the USA.  On the small scale it's basically just a learning device and a vote on the blockchain network for software upgrades and forks.
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:30:51
At that point I think some central bankers will really be starting to sweat.  The increase in transaction volume certainly points there.  If we all work really hard at it maybe we can get there in 3 years.  But we need more retail locations to accept BTC to boost adoption.

So, assuming that coins are continually lost over time the value can rise slightly.  I would think as the value increases the rate that the units are lost will decrease.  So, even if we assume that a sizeable portion of the coins are lost.  Say 20%, would the math still work?  Obviously this is a somewhat hypothetical scenario since it is likely that fiat will coexist for a substantial amount of time but I want to understand what the absolute best case scenario would be for appreciation of the coin?  Sort of an upper bound if you will.
@_date: 2017-01-08 19:12:52

Sure it is a lot of speculation.  It is my opinion.  Shall I edit my post with a disclaimer or say I feel or beware, forward looking fiction?  I thought the forward looking nature of the post was self evident.  I can't really give much evidence to back up something that hasn't happened yet.  Bitcoin is a new phenomenon so government reactions can only be guessed at.
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:27:11
That's great LOL!  For the common man, meaning your security gate agents etc..  this is fine.  My concern is when the chairman of the federal reserve flies... assuming he doesn't fly private, he WOULD likely notice something like this.  The common man won't know the BTC tag but big bankers and ppl in power will.  Why make our lives harder?  Things are going to get really crazy in the next five years.  The more of a lead we can get on the fiat guys the better.
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:53:55
Lol no.  Not like they would even know what it is.  I have actually made large BTC purchases direct from other banks and simply received a phone call with them wanting to confirm it was a valid purchase.  Smart on their part.  I didn't even mind since it let me know they actually have some security measures in place.

They are looking at being required to join a national biometric database in order to make transactions in electronic form.  The government is going to force them to make the transition to electronic currency.  I figured as many as possible would bale to BTC.  However, if most of your country operates on cash and does not have bank accounts it would take quite a while for them to transition even if they all have mobiles with internet.
I agree, everyone here thinks that there is going to be this magical transition to BTC but a changeover can not happen that fast.  Just look at how long its taking in Venezuela and those folks have no other options other than just shipping in paper USD.

That compound interest thing really pays off ;)
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:28:27
Well, that IS interesting.  It would appear that if you overlay the adoption rate or wallet total estimates over this the price could actually be considered cheap... at least by me.
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:38:44
I actually posted about this the other day.  CB credited my BTC a full two days BEFORE the EFT posted to the bank account!  I don't know if the bank is just not showing pending transactions properly or if CB had a tiny bug.
I suspect the bank is waiting to post larger transactions when the account balance is close to them in hopes that they can charge overdraft fees.  This is a common tactic that they use to make money.  If the largest transaction hits first and the account overdraws they get to charge for each small transaction that bounces rather than just the one fee from the large transaction.  I have not seen these games being played by a bank in like 10 years but here we are again.  I really doubt CB is lending me BTC for a couple of days.  
@_date: 2016-12-30 17:43:44


I'm pretty sure that will fall under money laundering at some point.  You need to trust the tumbler too and I doubt this is a solution for very large transactions / numbers of coins.
@_date: 2016-12-29 15:56:06
I get this sense too.  But, over time as more and more people adopt the currency, wouldn't the market be less subject to any individual whale?
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:31:18
Wow!  Thanks.  This is getting close.  But, I think it will be a long time before pricing is steady enough for items marked in retail to have fixed uBTC prices.  That will be a great day when we see that happen.

Thanks,  too many Moscow Mules tonight!

Probably referring to the Bitcoin tax.  It costs money to move from BTC to fiat.
@_date: 2016-12-30 13:48:18
Can confirm.  This works.  Went from Bitpay to Mycelium yesterday.
Edit:  FWIW I think you can use both wallets with the same private key and both will function in parallel.  This is why you NEVER release or show the private key to anyone.  
@_date: 2016-12-30 05:10:48
Well someone is buying a boat!
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:01:22
Well, you SHOULD explain because residential power in the US is typically &gt;$0.10 kwh and commercial medium voltage / distribution voltage is around $0.08 kwh without power factor penalty.  Obviously a 20% difference in costs has a direct impact on the potential profitability of a system.   Now if you are paying $0.00 you are stealing from someone or have power generation costs you are not taking into account.  Either way an "investor" needs to know.
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:32:54
What I don't understand is how would debt be priced in?  Also, derivatives are HUGE.  But, aren't they an inflationary pressure on fiat?  Would derivatives further increase demand since the payments would need to be effectively purchased on the market?  I am trying to wrap my head around all of this but since we have never in modern times had an equivalent global currency.  Can you explain your reasoning how other assets such as gold would contribute to the value of the coin?  These physical assets and commodities won't be replaced by bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-29 15:52:05
Aren't you still assuming Gold has equal ability to store wealth as it does today?  Apparently some of the value has already shifted to cryptocurrency.   Also, Gold would not be eliminated by a full success of bitcoin.  It will still have many many uses both in jewelry and industrial/technological.  So, I don't see the $7T of "value" being transferred.  Although, some likely will/is already.  It certainly isn't 100% clear if you look at the charts though

@_date: 2016-12-29 19:02:51
I need to order some stickers for next time I travel ;)  But seriously, we should avoid provoking the government.  We want the bureaucracy to realize what is going on well after they have lost the battle.  Let's just agree to pretend it is all business as usual until the majority of people have wallets and are using them daily.
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:12:58
Enough with this anarchist BS!  You NEED some form of gov't to protect property and personal rights.  Also, there are many services that a government entity provides that private enterprise can't.
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:18:12
I think that the uBTC is not a bad way to define costs.  Maybe it will be shortened to uB with the Bitcoin symbol for price tags in stores.  I don't think conflating the coin units with any other measure is a good idea.  The need to do this will decrease as the volatility decreases.  Volatility will decrease once a certain adoption level is reached.  At what % of the current economy that number is though nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:06:25
Alt Coins have an amazing market cap for the little media coverage they get.  I still don't know how BTC is around 80% of all crtypto currency usually.
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:31:48
Needed more meat.  But it does have some telling info.  A mere 20% jump in searches?! Really?  The adoption is far less and slower than I would like to have seen in this crisis.  Hopefully each time something like this occurs in a different country the jump to bitcoin will be larger and larger percentages of the population.  Because at this point from what I see BTC did not capitalize on the situation.  I sure hope this is the leading edge of a large wave.
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:58:55
Actually, I have considered buying on margin.  I don't currently have the financial tools in place to do this.  But, I as well as others are at least considering it.  In my case, my main apprehension is that not nearly as many people in India have jumped into Bitcoin as I would like.  I was expecting to see a much more viral response to the currency issues than I have.  This indicates to me that there is either a constrained exchange in that country (as indicated by the price differential to the USD at the BTC exchanges) or there is more friction in the adoption of the technology by the general public than I had anticipated.  For now Ill stick with just putting some spare change into my wallets.

I half remember that.  Oh, wait that was college.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:36:04
Well it's is somewhat similar to a wall street firm fucking up and loosing millions and nobody seems to care then so... Buyer beware?    Coin supply reduced.  If even that much money can't cause a reversal it kinda proves the immutability of Solidity contracts.  Maybe that is what is going on with the price?

Agreed!  But let's not let irrational exuberance get the best of us.  There are a lot of challenges ahead and Bitcoin.  But, I do think it will out last many Fiat.

Supply of ETH just dried up a bit.  Could be a good thing but the market doesn't appear to be seeing it that way.  FWIW I expected a bigger drop.

@_date: 2017-04-01 21:22:22
Ehhhh... Sometimes it does.  About half the time my transaction is instant and the BTC is sent from the CB wallet to my storage wallet right away.  The other times it sits there in pending for 45 minutes.  No idea why and it's not really acceptable.

It's not just $50k orders either.  I can't explain why the hell a $500 buy of ETHEREUM shows pending forever and then even after it's "sent" does not actually hit the network for a substantial period of time.  Small buys should be quick. So, you know the money can then be used to exchange for goods and services.
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:00:38
My thought exactly.  
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:27:01
You need some form of internet access to use crypto currency.  How are you going to spend BTC for anything after the communications infrastructure is destroyed or disabled?
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:07:14
In still waiting for everyone to realize 99% of the ICO's are bullshit and then implode the crypto currency markets.  I can only hope.

There are not a lot of good options for Etherium.  Most wallets suck or don't store the private keys locally.  I really don't think that the market price for Etherium is justified given how little support exists for payments and wallets.  But it does work more smoothly than BTC right now.  For BTC there are dozens of options that will let you get the private keys and make cold storage wallets too.  I have yet to find an Etherium wallet I like.
As far as the Aug 1 BTC change.  I will cold store most and see what happens with the network/s.  That is at least one of the benifits of JAXX.  It's not perfect but it does allow access to your fund information even if the network is offline.
@_date: 2017-05-28 22:14:19
It works and the interface is somewhat intuitive.  However, it does NOT work well for other currencies when there are a lot of transactions.  For example Etherium with more than 10 transactions in the history gets really slow.  By 30 it's practically unusable.  Clearing the cache helps a little but for a shot time only.

You are both right.  I think there is also some fear of stuck transactions during a fork.  I know a lot of people are transacting in ETH now.  The volume is way up even if you remove the ICO BS!
