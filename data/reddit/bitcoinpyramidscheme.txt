Protip: If you didn't want to provide proof, you shouldn't have made the claim. After all, do you want people to just take others on their word alone, and not on evidence? The only reason you would want that is if you are a lying shill/bagHODLer desperate to get your money back.
SPOILER ALERT: You won't be getting your money back, because the Willy bot left the market with MtGox so there will be no future bubble, and most of the existing money was cashed out in 2013. The funny thing is that even if you really do have Bitcoins you bought for $5, you wasted your only opportunity to get rich quick through stealing from others. Now that window of opportunity has closed.

Proof? I.e. link to fresh dust transaction on blockchain.info from address
BTW even if true, this would only mean that anyone else here is at a disadvantage and should get out, because there is some guy who going to cash out your money in the future (i.e. If PastaArt sells 100BTC now, that's $253 x 100 = $25300, $25300 - $500 = $24800 that is going to be stolen from you - i.e. the money you stupidly put into shitcoins)

And this is why I always ask for proof - reveals the shills very easily
It's free, simple and doesn't reveal your identity.
The fact that you won't provide proof speaks for itself.
On a side note, sucks to be anyone who is a victim of this pyramid scheme. Remember folks, with Bitcoin you only get out what you put in (Bitcoin doesn't generate money out of thin air) - and most of the cash has already been cashed out long ago in the form of Mansions and Lamborghinis, so ask yourself: 'What's left for me?'
