Fantastic Idea, as many have said, good luck to you.
However, I will also have to agree, the name is not very good.  If you want to be taken seriously, you should have a serious name.  Maybe you can use buttercoin as the dev name and once you release an actual exchange - you do something more serious.  Even Mt. Gox's name is slightly ridiculous and hard to take seriously... There is a lot to a well planned out name, I must say.
Bitchange, cointrade, or something even more technical that uses an acronym. 
Just my 2 cents.

We all know that paypal started with much lower fees than it has today.  
We all know credit card fees have *increased* over the last decades as it gained in popularity and we all know bitcoin fees will increase as it gains popularity.  Once there is a MC/Visa of crypocurrency (and don't fool yourself, there will only be 1-3 major exchangers) they will corner the market and increase fees.  That's how money works.
Also, let's be honest... no retailer is just going to give their consumer discounts when they don't need to.  There may be an opportunity for a retailer to reduce it by 1-3% because you pay in Bitcoins, but the average consumer isn't going to see that as enough incentive to go through the "hassles" of doing bitcoins.
The OP is very correct in his concerns, as I feel they are all very valid in making it difficult for the currency be for more than just investment purposes.  Right now, bitcoins are basically a stock, that's about it.
Get Amazon or something huge like that to accept them, and get a processor/exchanger that is reliable and easy to use and you'll have a currency.  Until then, it's just stock.

Any suggestion for those that mine with Slush's?  Any servers that are backups that we could hardcode in?
