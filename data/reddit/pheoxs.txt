If there are no places to spend a coin then the only people buying and selling are people trying to make a profit so it's every momentum based. As it rises more people hold and it pushes the value up. As it falls people panic and sell. When you start having a lot more volume go through as people spend their bitcoins it means there is a faster turn over of coins and when people want to buy there are more available

What about the other perspective though. I buy your computer online and pay via bitcoin. You ship me a case with broken / missing components. I have no way to dispute.
People need to realize that the non-reversible direction of bitcoin only benefits the seller. The buyer's get nothing from it. Paypal costs me nothing to buy with and protects if the buyer doesn't ship anything or doesn't come as advertised. 
If you think sellers are going to lower their prices because they aren't paying that 3-4% fee you are mistaken. They will maintain the same prices and make more money. That is reality.

I can buy itunes and xbox points in store via gift cards and activate online. No different than that, lots of people go and buy top up cards rather than credit cards.

Could they not just issue bills monthly similar to what they do now? I buy/rent/watch whatever 10 movies for 1$ each and at the end of the month I get billed 10$.
Or have people buy credits/tokens. You can just buy 10/20/50$ whatever tokens/credits at once then pay per watch until you are out. Basically same this as M$ does with Xbox.

Any chance I could get better pricing for a super small 2-3 person server? Just want my younger siblings to be able to play together.

I don't see why there would be another bubble. With all the integrations to sites there will be a significant more volume of transactions rather than previously when people were just holding because of the rising value. As more bitcoins trade hands as people use it as a transaction network it will help stabilize the price

ELI5: Why is this such a big deal?

Or they start running articles with misinformation that it used to be 1000$ = 1 BTC and now for just 1$ you can get a thousand XBT! The sky is falling run away!!

They'll form relations in their heads to their fiat currencies. When I travel in Japan I know 1 yen ~= 1 cent. So 100 yen ~= 1 dollar and I base my purchases on that.
Same thing if they realize 1000 millibits ~= 1$ then they can relate how expensive an item is.

If I buy something from a merchant and pay with Visa. Visa takes ~3% or so. If they're only making 5% margins, thats 2% for them after Visa takes their cut.
What if they accept bitcoins and offer a 1% discount as incentive. Now 5% margin - 1% coinbase - 1% discount = 3% left as profit.

Even if he's 80, he just found out about it a few weeks ago and knows all about it? Doubtful.

Realistically even at this point he could sell 10 bitcoins per day without really affecting the market much and be set for life making 10k$USD per day. Then down the road when everything is more stable dump more / give it to people / donate / horde / hire scientists to develop weapons.

It goes both ways. ASIC's are connected to the internet and really don't have any proper protection. It wouldn't surprise me as the price of bitcoin rises if we don't start seeing attacks on ASICs try to redirect the hashing power.

I took it as he saw 1/2 drop in one, panicked and moved to another and then was hit with another drop, etc maybe?

I'm dealing with a email money transfer I received having the sender claim they didn't send it and are trying to reverse it. My Branch Manager told me to go ask Bitcoin to just reverse the transaction. When I told him that wasn't possible because its meant to be one-way transactions he said I should phone Bitcoin up and complain to them.
No matter how many times I explained there is no central control he just kept leading back to 'Go phone Bitcoin and take it up with them'

Not necessarily. People have different tolerances and that helps drive the market. I might wait until I've seen a full day of gains, you might wait until you've seen half a dozen green candle sticks. Another person might wait for a full week of recovery. 
The people that get in earlier win more and lose more. Which all comes back to risk: Don't risk what you can't afford to lose.

It's impossible to perfectly time the market but realistically. More exchanges in china opening = influx in money = price rises. China blocks payment providers = less money coming in = price drops.
It's not hard to play things safe and still come away with a profit. You won't make the same ridiculous gains as the higher risk people but if you ignore the btc-e troll box and forum circle jerks and just observe whats happening its easy to be ~reasonably~ accurate (again, not perfectly) about the direction of the market.
There is never anything wrong with pulling money out of a market and just waiting to see what happens. If it rises you can invest back in and lose 'potential' gains, but you haven't lost any real money. If it falls you can wait and jump in when you want. Remember once you've converted back to FIAT you can't 'lose' money, only possible gains.

You have to remember to keep emotion out of it. Once you've bought a stock, or a cryptocurrency you need to ignore what you paid for it and watch the market itself. Ask yourself, if you had X$ in an exchage right now in USD, would you buy in right now? If the answer is yes, hold, if the answer is no, sell.
Simply saying 'I bought in at 1k so waiting until it rises back to that' is poor investing. If you know its going down, why not sell now, and buy in at a lower cost. Two days ago everyone should've realized it was falling. Had you sold then and bought in right now you could've had the same amount of money but ~50% more coins.

I use paper 2FA. Print off a list of access codes and just use one at a time going down the list. When I get to the end of the 50, I reprint a new sheet with 50 more on it.

It's going to be a long while before it gets to that point. We'd have to hit 100,000$ per bitcoin to manage 1 Satoshi to equal 1 cent. To put that in perspective the Bitcoin economy would need to be 2.1 trillion $ at that point or 1/35th of the worlds GDP.

This would be really handy for giveaways, especially around the Christmas season. Vendors can post up on forums as a give away and the first X number of people can claim their prize.

The same thing applies to both though. Risky investments are perfectly fine if you accept the risk.
There is a reason why people stress diversity. It's not balance risk (potentially higher gains) with security (lower gains but stability)

Lol, someone is trying to pump the price so they can bail out.
