Look, as much as I love positive news, laws and court in China are not very reliable, often time it is up to the Party, if not up to Xi himself. Even worse, Xi allows it does not mean his successor will. And don't even get me started on local enforcement...

They are buying time... Don't be silly, the rich get to this place because they have money to hire bright minds to earn money for them, not necessarily because they are good at it themselves. Bitcoin is just a thing where they learn how to profit from it.

As a trezor user, I second this. In crypto, you're your own bank, you have to maintain it. Just like a bank has to maintain its alarm, manage security guards etc.

Great! We don't have to worry about recurring payments and over-charging from gym!(I suspect they will have something fishy to make up for it thou) as for fees, it depends if both parties have segwit.

I share the same worry as you, unfortunately it seems to me that most people here are Westerners, they don't seem to care or understand. That being said, the CCP will take extreme caution before they touch people's wallet en mass, especially when it involves so many rich people.

My friend, may God bless you. I do not think that you should bear all the faults here. Your family loves you, but misunderstood the responsibility ultimately still lies within the thieves.

I'm from Hong Kong and here we have very low taxes , 15% and lots of tax deduction, problem is that government has to provide healthcare, education, security etc. So they jack up the land prices,e.g. a 500ft in poor neighbourhood costs 500k USD. So the money has to come from the people, one way or another.

tbh, as long as people think that something will make them profit, be it gold, crypto, drugs, or even cow shit, trading and pricing will exist, I don't like BCH, but what can you do? Not to mention the early ones are indeed earning money.

Bitcoin is 10-15% higher in many East Asian countries... thdre's still room for arbitrage. That being said, the legal/ banking law is not exactly simple, especially if you try to sell/ buy a large amount. Once you cross a border, it could be very different.

They want to make money, they don't care about the technological aspect or the idealism behind it, and yes it is a danger.
p.s. I personally know a billionaire who has the same attitude towards bitcoin and he is an investor.
All in all, this is not healthy for bitcoin

Think they muddy the water, won't tell you what is their real commission, or maybe they are the miners themselves.

China is bound by a dictatorship, plain and simple. If the CCP wish to control miners, it can, but at quite a huge cost, that will show inconfidence in CNY, they may have a smarter way to deal with it. BCH could be a start.

I just want to share my feelings. I bought at 17.5k, and I am sad and panicking. However, I consider bitcoin to be long term investment, I do not plan to withdraw bitcoin to fiat until 20-30 years later (I'm in my 20's) I believe I will be right after all, but it is the contradicting emotional feelings and rational thinking that bothers me.
