yes. going against the bitcoin fanatics isn't allowed. ultimately this hurts everyone.
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:35:57
goodbye kraken. hello robinhood. can't possibly be worse than kraken!
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:32:57
you think wrong
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:32:21
yes, me too. was going to start nibbling at $5,000 but it never got there. another opportunity around $5,000 will come shortly though. be patient. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:57:05
Just be glad you aren't in Kraken. This is possibly the worst exchange on the planet.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:15:55
is this a union? i thought quality of one's post is more important than the amount of time served on Reddit!!!
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:17:39
Yes, couldn't agree more!
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:37:44
Kraken?!? Are you serious?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:13:30
this guy is the biggest pumper on wall street. beware his advice. he's the same guy who said the 2018 low is in when bitcoin recently hit $9,200. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:54:13
probably. look at what happened when china/s. korea/india announced regulations. next tuesday the US is set to possibly announce regulations. i sure the hell wouldn't take a position before then. 5,000 could easily be reached in hours if the announcement is perceived as negative.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:26:41
correct! every one of the so called "hodlers" panic sold on the way down to 6k. i'm just encouraging people to think about keeping some cash ready if we see another pull back. long term (think years, not minutes) i am bullish.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:41:38
Uh, ya, i'm pretty sure a piece of code made out of thin air is not worth $8,500!
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:13:47
i wonder if this is a prelude to next tuesdays regulatory meeting in DC. stay tuned and don't take a large position until the outcome is known. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:26:02
perhaps, but something smelled awful bad in those hearings. there's no reason the underlying technology can't be used without using bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:15:58
Has anyone noticed that the dopes at Kraken changed their withdrawal policy in February without alerting clients. I urge everyone to go on their website and review the new limits. I cannot get my USD out as planned and this is causing me serious pain!  
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:41:05
the hilarious part is they termed it an "upgrade" to their previous policy!
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:14:09
yes. whoever it is can create FOMO whenever they want it appears.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:50:37
just be careful. price movements seemed to be controlled by a small group of players and that makes for very irrational prices at times.
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:19:04
maybe he's doubling down because he originally bought above $18,000.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:55:27
if you think today was bad for bitcoin, just wait until tuesday's sec meeting. any hint of regulation and bitcoin will be under $5,000 by the end of the day!
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:38:12
somebody manipulating bitcoin price big time before liquidity dries up during chinese new year.
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:43:27
yes, agree. someone has been pumping bitcoin from $6,000 to $8,500 and it looks like the small guys are getting sucked in. Be careful. Just like the run from $9,200 to $13,000 ended in tears when it crashed to $5,900. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:57:04
i've been watching this joker for a while. this is hilarious. during the interview at the highly prestigious channel 84 (huh) he says the japan hack stole $500 mil in bitcoin?!? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:47:16
yes, popping, but not completely popped. may take another couple weeks to see $1,000
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:20:08
Can you provide the new withdrawal policy for everyone?!? And while you're at it, please post the fully audited statement of reserves for all the coins listed on Kraken as well as the names of all auditors that have reviewed your financials since inception. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:31:22
looks like btc starting to crash again. this never gets old.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:30:42
The hearing smelled very bad and put the SEC in a suspect light. They actually said that part of their plan was to educate librarians on the dangers of btc so they can assist customers asking about its dangers. Where do they get these people at the SEC???
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:13:11
don't forget the system updates and changes to withdrawal policies that customers don't receive email alerts about!
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:26:07
yes, i can't wait to dump the crappy kraken exchange!
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:31:54
will test the low of $5,900 once more. get ready folks.
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:30:46
their system was down again last night for about an hour. the problems never seem to end.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:41:57
you should definitely wait until next week's hearing in the US before buying.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:17:56
funny though. bitcoin falls from 20k to break under 6k. so obviously, all the so called HODL nuts caved into the pressure and sold.
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:46:49
hey, they are still better than kraken!
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:21:55
Looking like a $500 drop in 2 hours. Don't like it!
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:59:53
decline in stocks means a risk off environment. that means down, down, down bitcoin goes....
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:16:22
yes, he owns like a half of a bitcoin. wow! he actually has zero interest in cryptos. i'm going w/ elon cause he's the brightest bro in the world.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:47:18
yes, this is a no-brainer.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:06:59
i think it's a short squeeze. once the squeeze is over the drop will resume and the bubble will pop once and for all.
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:40:15
all the hodler's sold out in a new york minute and helped push the price from $20k to $6k.  
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:02:24
yes, this is eerily similar to the recent decline to $5,900. that's why i posted the question.
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:13:48
google it. he manipulated it on Mt. Gox. A very small group of people own a huge % of bitcoin. as a result they can make it dance whichever way they want.
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:51:16
complete nonsense. this article is totally bogus. i'd bet the author is long bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:01:02
keep pumpin and i'll keep dumpin
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:54:19
do you want to pay over $9,000 for something created out of thin air? looks like the psychological level of $9,000 is about to be tested. put these two statements together and you will have your answer.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:51:16
trust me when i say you don't want to use kraken. just research their online reviews.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:34:55
boy you snowflakes don't like to hear anything negative about bitcoin. the lightening network was supposed to greatly increase speed and cut fees. do your homework before speaking please.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:48:22
is it ready to drop to $3,000 once the tether issue is revealed?
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:45:43
i am counting the seconds until i can get the hell out of kraken!
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:34:13
when the winklevi start pumping you know it's time to get the hell out of bitcoin. these guys saw their fortune cut 70% and are quite nervous i suspect.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:51:15
uhhh, where. please don't post baloney.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:43:09
Sorry, tether is completely different. cryptos go up and down based on technicals and supply/demand. tether was subpoenaed, fired their auditor, and many believe that they don't have the $1 for $1 reserves that they claim. if in fact tether is a scam then bitcoin goes WAY down.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:28:57
there is usually only one reason companies fail to post audited financial statements.
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:23:16
fiat is backed up by the full faith and credit of the u.s. govt. bitcoin is backed up by......air
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:24:57
this is untrue! the annual withdrawal limit is $130,000 and even with proof of source of funds cannot be increased unless you are an accredited investor (Proof of Income $200K annually ($300K Joint) for last 2 years OR Net Worth &gt; $1 million). 
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:40:20
at least you ain't on kraken!
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:19:40
will it be another fake crackdown like our beloved SEC or will it actually have some teeth?
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:19:54
there aren't that many great exchanges at the moment. robin hood is a recent option and probably worth checking out. one exchange to avoid at all costs is kraken.
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:14:48
actually, it's exactly what the article is about. further, there is almost no one who hasn't heard of the lightening network unless you are a complete newbie. it has been endlessly pumped in the media for months as the great savior of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:02:43
not sure i've heard any other "saviors". can you name one?
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:25:12
people seem to be ignoring this news for some reason. this will sap a lot of the demand by millennials.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:34:50
hopefully you are joking and sell out after a quick pump. no one can truly believe this.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:54:07
yes, agree. if everything is fine then why did the last auditor not issue an opinion!!!
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:30:41
yes, when the SEC turns a blind eye to the most volatile asset in history it's a problem.
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:21:50
someone manipulating this big time on very low volume
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:53:19
yes, they all panicked and sold out during the last crash to $6k. it will happen again, trust me. the bubble's gonna eventually pop once and for all.
