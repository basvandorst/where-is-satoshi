It appears I've been volunteered by my fellow team members to contribute resources to this discussions when/if they're requested by participants. So here I am :-)
A few bits of useful data, perhaps:
* [DeepDNS]( is entirely built on opensource code &amp; we're happy to both share process specific details and actively assist any other project teams who would like to leverage the basic concept for their own deployments. It's less of a drop-in solution that's broadly extensible as such, and more of an interconnected system of components that enables specific network functionality. Also we've never actually formally announced it, nor explained it competently in any public posting, frankly. Which we should perhaps do at some point.
* Our [forum]( is filled with all sorts of useful stuff, and also notoriously difficult to navigate and find specific information within. We reorganise it, and then the project continues to evolve in new ways and the reorg is quickly outdated. We're trying, despite how poorly it seems we do at keeping up with the emergent nature of forum discussions. The admin team is in process of doing another reorg this morning, which we hope will lessen the fail of the current layout. And apologies to all involved; it's not our intent for the forum to be incomprehensivle, it just seems to end up that way repeatedly.
* Our [torstorm]( Tor-cstorm gateway functionality now transits full-spectrum Tor traffic - not only .onion sessions. We've not announced that yet, apparently, but it works and has for a few weeks. There's a discussion of torstorm's security &amp; cryptographic model, in some detail, [available here]( although it could use some updates, which is a task on my list currently.
* We enabled https on the .onion version of our own main website ( via torstorm or  native .onion), and have done so as a proof of concept of our newly-created [KeyChain TLS auth framework]( We're quite proud of that specific work, as it coheres several critical-path security improvements and extensions in one, tangible resource. Details are [published here]( in long-form version.
Please let us if there's additional information needed, &amp; I'll do my best to hunt it down. We're, as a team, vastly more active on [twitter]( and [github]( than here, frankly, but we'll do our best to keep our n00b to acceptable levels.
Cheers.
