Not suggesting anything other than having 3.5% of all currency for all time stolen is fucked.  Keep going, start over, whatever, my money will safely be far away.

I'm not sure what you're point is but yes nobody can do anything about all those dirty coins that's the problem.
email wouldn't carry that 3.5% of all emails are dirty forever

I'll just cry myself myself to sleep on my pile of money that I could actually withdraw from the bank and spend at every business on the continent, you just keep jerkin it to worthless bits.

and maybe if there is only like 1/10000th of the people left it will actually be able to process all their transactions

The spam comes from the fundamental problem that senders are not verified with email.  As an alternative people could block all unknown senders, but they do want to get those emails so instead we fight this fundamental problem with fancy spam filters and user education. 
Bitcoin problems like this are coming partly from a lack of regulation.  This is not fundamental to the operation of a currency (like receiving email from unkown people is fundamental to email) it is a 'feature' of bitcoin.
In summary the weaknesses of email are fundamental to the concept of uninvited communication, if people want uninvited communication they deal with those weaknesses.  These weaknesses of bitcoin are not fundamental to the concept of a currency, they are fundamental to the concept of a unregulated currency which people can choose to avoid and most will.

Those aren't advantages anymore when theft or fraud occurs unless you are the one perpetrating it.  
If someone did steal half a billion dollars worth or whatever % of all coins they will skate and there is nothing anyone can do about it which is shit for a system people are supposed to trust.  I think even though it is popular to rage against authority there are advantages to having someone with power to 'make things right'.  
With bitcoin there is no regard for right or wrong the chips fall where they stay.  Good can come of that (ie. cheap transactions, privacy) but also bad (millions stolen with no accountability).

gmail going down wouldn't mean 3.5% of all emails that ever existed or will exist will be in unknown hands.
With email everyone can move on and forget about the compromised service.  To me 3.5% of all coins potentially stolen and sitting in nefarious hands is a stink cloud that will follow bitcoin forever.
It is more like no matter what email service you switch to 3.5% of all emails are forwarded to the hackers.  Yep that would kill the email.
A more apt comparison would be if the entire current bitcoin database were scrapped and started over from coin 0.  That would indeed have no attachment to this mess and "the protocol was not compromised" would apply but that's not what we're talking about.

I've never used a currency where 3.5% of all that will ever exist has already been stolen

Great way to scam suckers, up there with scientology

Terrible analogy.
Users could make a pretty clean break from a broken\hacked email service.  Set up a new account, tell everyone, done.  Yes it would suck but years from now consequences will have faded.
Bitcoin may be intact as a protocol but the fact that 3.5% of coins disappeared into unknown hands is not something you can just shake off and move on from.  It's a significant and permanent change in the distribution of the currency and the only 'clean break' would be to hit the reset button on the whole thing.

Most of that money was not stolen it was merely spent on things the governments don't approve of.
This is more like $75B simply disappearing from people's bank accounts.  That doesn't happen because we have regulations and insurance.  If it did it would seriously undermine people's confidence in the financial system just like this will undermine confidence in bitcoin.

So?  You're comparing residue from a presumably consensual activity to outright stolen money.
This isn't like people choosing to spend billions on things the gov doesn't like, it's like those billions up and disappearing into thin air.

Not a lawyer but I think such insider trading laws would only apply to things that are legally regulated.  Enjoy that bed.

If you're really that ignorant why guess?
It's like saying I don't know what Linux people do, recompile their kernel I guess.

I have heard the theory that different learning styles on students can be more beneficial to one gender than another on average (ie. boys might tend to be more kinesthetic or visual learners and girls more auditory, so a shift to auditory might benefit girls - that was made up i don't remember the specifics).  
I have also heard that the reduction in play and recess time may be contributing to boys slipping because they generally have more hyperactivity issues.
This guy is taking these tendencies and averages and taking it to a crazy extreme though.

As someone who designs ASICs that do useful things, I hate that this is how people are learning this word.  I can probably never use that word again outside the office without someone thinking I'm talking about bitcoin and giving me an aneurysm.

From the outside it looks you embraced the euphoria but want to ban the panic.  The question is will you be consistent when things get euphoric again or will it be a different approach again that time.
