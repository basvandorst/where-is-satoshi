It's not, but it's the first after I have increased the withdrawal limit. All the previous under 10k cleared in 1-2 days.

Yes, it’s called confirmation bias

As soon as the news was out the price discounted that into it, so yes, I believe that further news about the ETF will have no impact. Even so, as you say, I expect higher than usual volatility as agents have to rebalance their position.

Imho it is not as binary as it can seems.. what if a third side comes out? Who should be given these new token for the third-side?

It makes sense, right. Just I thought HODLED to be more dank.

You will see Poloniex and Finex have similar (higher) prices compared to Kraken. This is because they both rely on Tether (USDT) to process withdrawal and deposit. Unfortunately Tether is run mostly by the same people behind Finex and they all have their bank account locked.

Your reasoning assumes no difficulty increase, which can not be. In the past we used to see 3-4 periods with consecutive +18-20% increase in hashrate. Today the magnitude is smaller but still there is. 
If you do this calculus for all the other cloud mining op. they will all have profit &gt; cost the 1st month, problems start 2 months later.

Bitcoin has never been supposed to be used as everyday currency. Tokens built on top of bitcoin's blockchain (also called sidechain or 2nd layer blockchain) are.

If SW "signaling" gets over a certain percentage it gets automatically locked-in

Poloniex trying to cover its ass because of insider trading investigation?

It won't work anymore with SegWit, no need for a BIP.

Because it is neutral and everyone can use it, no ethic involved.
