But first we go down to 2.000

Buy now because this won't last long. The big money is about to jump in on it, and that means 15.000 in no time.

Don't give any information whatsoever to anyone, on the internet or in real life. Also, don't tell anyone you found that as it will make you a target - thieves or worse will be interested in you. Some "friends" might get envious, some might turn thieves, some might turn worse.
Learn by yourself until you know enough so you can handle whatever is in there. Start a wallet on your phone, start an account on an exchange, make some transactions, get familiar with the industry.
Look up and save any papers your husband left. There will be passwords, seeds (usually sequences of 12 or 24 words), private keys, 2fa (2 factor authentication) passwords hidden somewhere.
Go through his computer(s) and look up anything resembling the above mentioned.
DO NOT take pictures or share those passwords /keys/codes with anyone.
Don't click on any links people send you. Type it yourself on your browser. If the link is something like "*click here*" DO NOT click it.
Whatever crypto you have, keep it. The market is down right now. It will go back up and crash again before the summer (every year it crashes around the 15th of June, the same as it crashes around the 15th of January). Wait until June for cashing out as whatever he left you will be worth 5 to 10 times more by then. Anyway, look at charts, compare the past 4 years and identify the points where values are highest. Sell during one of those periods.
Good luck. I hope he left you some valuable crypto assets :)

Get monero, send monero to a wallet, from there to another exchange, start trading there. Rinse and repeat until you cash out (preferably to a off-shore).

This guy is doing what Saddam and Ghadafi tried: to sell oil for something else other than USD. Soon he’ll be called a dictator, there will be reports of him killing his own people, and he will be assassinated. His country invaded, and a puppet government put in place by the US. History repeats himself. Uncle sam (&lt;- no capital letter, that s) will do what uncle sam (&lt;- no capital letter there either) always does.

Family member starts a foundation and you donate the money to it. Then you get a job there and get paid monthly.

Best meme I’ve seen so far. This one made me laugh out loud.
