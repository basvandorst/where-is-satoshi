This is very misleading. The gap from 18k to 20k was 9 days.

The 'Internet user' v 'Crypto user' chart is wrong.      
It shows 20million as being half as much as 4billion.

Tbf this person was obviously hired for her looks to read a script that she clearly doesn't comfortably understand.     
Unlike    
     
and    
      
Who evidently write their own material.

It's called bootstrapping. It is a thing, yes.

He says he has the keys. He just "won't lower himself to use them". You are deluding yourself friend.       
Think about that for a sec: He's gone 'all in' and created BitcoinSV, saying it's 'the real Bitcoin'.       
All he'd have to do, is move his BTC off the original wallet he says he has, and BSV would instantly shoot to No1 passed BTC. But he didn't. Because he can't.

But now it's all okay. Phew that was close.

I'd try to keep away from anything that sounds like it could be a fork.

It's a blatant phishing site. Plain and simple.

That headline "Allows Purchasing of Lightning Network Bitcoins" Makes it sound like it's two separate chains.       
Could be worded better.

Coinbase has 13mill users. I'd estimate 90% of Crypto holders have an account.   
Are there any clear facts on that estimate?

How do you kill yourself unironicaly? Or ironically for that matter?
