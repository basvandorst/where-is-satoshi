If he didn't sell his coins at $.06, they never would've been worth the $17k high. 
Everyone wishes they held their coins, but if everyone held all their coins, the price never would've risen.

What state are you in?
@_date: 2013-07-08 20:05:42
Yes, now it is. To prevent money laundering.
@_date: 2013-07-08 20:06:24
when was the last time you used it?
@_date: 2013-07-08 20:06:16
I've used it in my state plenty of times too but they recently stopped processing transactions in my area.

Proposed by a 'mayoral hopeful' who is known for making 'outlandish proposals'. The USD is fiat currency (as is the Euro, which is specifically not included in the proposal) and derives its value from being a medium of exchange. Read as, because so many people give it purchasing power, holding it is a form of a (very tiny but still quantifiable) investment. It's not a 'ponzi scheme,' and US debt is something entirely unrelated.

awesome. thank you.

True. I just did it, will change password. Thanks.

Dude, hire a financial advisor. Don't go to Reddit for this advice, what are you thinking? 
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:06:15
You have the concept right. 
If everyone bought and sold immediately, for say 500/btc, the value of the coin is irrelevant. If everyone did this, the market would be stable at a nonsignificant price.
Many people buy and don't sell immediately though, which creates scarcity and is why the price rises.

With BTC miners, a much larger volume of supply is being pumped into the market than before. Supply goes up with constant demand, price drops.
Multiple corporations have banned VPNs, and exchange sites all over are being harassed by governments; MT Gox stopped trading in USD and BitInstant hasn't accepted new transactions in most areas for a while. Even the BitCoin Foundation is getting sued.
Personally, I don't care if BTC are at $1 or $1000, I just want the price to stay constant.

You were phished. You're out 50btc. Sorry bro.:/
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:56:41
yes, i pay a similar fee. you'll pay this fee whenever you exchange any type of currency. you're paying a little because you want the benefits the other currency offers, whether it be use in a foreign country or anonymity online.

Right, this is the point of Bitcoin. I'd file a countersuit against Coinbase for deducting the 3 BTC back out of my account without my permission, but hey Ianal

Also, the messages are enough for a conspiracy to commit murder charge, yet it wasn't included in the report. 
Also, anyone find it fishy that the arrest was made two days after a government shutdown, making confirmation of this arrest impossible?

Dude bitcoins are decentralized, those coins are yours. Pay out. You'll regret not doing it later.

Question I've been wondering for a while so an answer would be most appreciated:)
I assume you automatically adjust the cost per btc to match a product's usd value. well, if someone buys from you with a bitcoin at, say, 100/coin, how soon do you convert those btc back to cash? and how do u do it? 
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:39:46
You're looking for the word 'entrapment,' but I doubt crimes of these magnitudes would be thrown out on such basis.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:29:48
You don't need a reason to sell. Have you made money on your investment? Then sell if you want to sell.
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:28:59
Bitcoins are supposed to be treated like currency; current price per btc is irrelevant. Buy the coins, buy your product, viola. When people buy coins but sit on them for the purpose of "investing," bubbles grow and burst and it tears down the confidence of the market.
Before the burst, I made a purchase on SR for an item worth $250. Paid in BTC at 215/btc. Those stayed in escrow during the burst, and the vendor recieved the bitcoins at 85/btc. This is an issue to be concerned about. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 04:36:50
Yes but if I'm not mistaken, that rate is set over time and not over # of blocks mined. Could be wrong.

Btc-e is now showing them under 8, so...
@_date: 2013-08-13 15:03:20
Thanks for the input. I kept my coins in blockchain
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:44:48
Because the price went down since three weeks ago? If you're not seeing profit from Bitcoin, you haven't held your investment long enough. If you thought you were going to make a quick buck on this bubble and didn't cash out in time, take it as a lesson learned and do more research next time. Anyone following Chinese BTC news could've seen this coming a day and a half ago. 
@_date: 2013-07-02 06:15:41
Thanks, just did it.

Didn't he once suggest people buy Berkshire Hathaway (may have been a different stock), only for them to go bankrupt a few days later?
@_date: 2013-10-23 01:11:45
Feel free to send it to me if you don't want it. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 18:03:35
Defense picks the jury, so probably not.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:15:35
EVERYONE SELL (so the price will drop and i can buy more) 
@_date: 2013-08-10 00:41:08
I read a similar story. Staying far away from them. Thank you.
