Perhaps you could, you know, add some alarms to limit damage. Have a built in shut down if a threshold is exceeded. Something. Anything. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:24:06
I would like to know the amount lost. I mean, for fucks sake, who writes software which can possibly leak a ton of coins while going unnoticed, when things like cold storage are used? It's like...1980 programming. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:46:41
Inside job? 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:49:01
Thanks for the reply.  Seems unusual.  Good luck, hope you can get to the bottom of this. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:44:05
In small batches. Not all at once. 
More likely, I'd imagine switching to a privacy policy coin though, if that's the goal. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:40:52
That's ridiculous. That's suggesting these master (read: moronic) criminals are going to just beat everyone to death. Because, who knows how much money one just might still have. So beat and beat until maybe you just might get $10 more! Jackpot! Or maybe dude dies. Whoops. Gimme a break.
This is something you may see in TV land. You'd be better off literally stealing some shit from  my house then trying that and ending up in jail the rest of your life. Which is exactly what would happen.
Who leaves a crap ton of crypto easily accessible anyway? If I actually had a bunch, then you'd have to drag me in to 4 banks over several days and airplane distances apart to recover my seed words. I'd also have a helluva security system and undisclosed back up plans in case something should actually happen to me. And even then after all your work, I may have dick all for all you know. I could've spent it by now. Maybe I never even had that much to begin with and I just like wearing a bitcoin t-shirt I got from a conference. Good luck master criminals, should have just taken my nice painting. Or the cash from my wallet even. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:17:08
Holy TV much. If I have a mansion then there is no fucking way Joe robber is getting this far. Highly doubt he has the skill to bypass security, or, even my dogs for that matter. And, there's also no fucking way I left my money just sitting around in my house, I can obviously afford to lock that shit down. Who is this magic criminal / total moron anyway? I know... He's the guy in jail by now. Right.
How about you let me know when someone who has secured their seed words split across multiple bank vaults gets robbed. Then we'll talk. Until then, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that's pretty safe. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:52:17
They magically know how much I own now? Damn they are good. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:29:56
You'd still have to tie an address to a person. That's not easy. And anyone can move through privacy coins or tumblers to hide shit anyway. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:59:22
So my wife is going to rob me? Well, that does seem about right.

Why must you buy a whole bitcoin? You could have invested some other amount, with which you'd be more comfortable with....
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:05:10
I'd do it. What's left in there isn't much, I don't care if I lose that. But having that at all keeps me interested in what's going on in this space. And I enjoy reading about bitcoin, the tech, the drama, even altcoins. With no skin in the game, I'd be much less inclined to come places like here. I find it fun, entertaining, and educational. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:19:34
is a sub for Canadians..
And I agree, quadrigacx is the way to go. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:14:55
Get approved on quadrigacx. It's the best for selling. For storing you may want a hardware wallet (Trezor or ledger nano s). 
Also, you can use for questions like this, as it's specific to Canadians. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:16:47
You're what they call a weak hand. I wish there were far fewer of you, but, the recent publicity no doubt brought in plenty. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:08:18
Solid advice from someone who clearly knows everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:52:52
It appears that you don't understand much of anything. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 11:25:39
...Or any other hardware or software wallet.  Why are we picking on trezor here in particular? Also, what a strange and unlikely scenario. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:29:09
But he is dedicating his entire "life" to saving the world from the evils of bitcoin! 
@_date: 2015-05-29 00:29:15
Ah I see.  So we are by chance picking favourable days.  I had haphazardly selected yesterday, where it worked out to 0.1%. So, instead, let's average over the last 30 days - It works out to 0.7%.  Not exactly 2% or 3% so let's not toss those numbers around, but, it is still something.  Higher than I would of guessed. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:41:09
Depends.   You can just link a credit card. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:10:27
Ever heard of chargebacks? 
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:55:29
Well,  then it's changed.   It's working fine for me, still. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:19:40
@_date: 2015-01-23 01:43:36
It still works, despite that message.  It works perfectly fine. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:24:20
Screen broken such that you cannot see anything, or just so you can't touch? Can you use a OTG cable to attach a mouse to the phone? 
@_date: 2015-01-23 01:09:56
This is just all shades of wrong. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:50:23
It certainly isn't helping. We need to focus on  things like segwit and LN otherwise things may not work out so well. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:11:47
Probably didn't have to wait until the last minutes to figure out that wasnt going to suddenly happen. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:20:14
Wow. You did a study on this that fast? 
@_date: 2015-05-28 15:46:55
That 2% blew my mind. So I did the math myself. It instead appears to be more along the lines of 0.1%. Can someone explain how that chart arrives at 2%? What numbers went in to it exactly? 
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:38:15
Well, to be fair, the number two guy isn't that far off. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 14:58:32
It would seem that any other ETFs will fail for the same reasons.

Who cares who found it. That's not what this is about.

If they are hardforking will they include segwit? 
@_date: 2015-05-28 14:11:12
Careful, this thread is starting to look like a pump.  You know what happens next. There is nothing new here.

*You not smart. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:19:46
There's literally a plethora of inform available on this. Backing up your keys, offline storage, secure wallets - This comes up every day.  If you figured out how to buy bitcoin, and have multiple degrees, I find it hard to believe you couldn't manage to take 10 minutes to read about it.  It's mind blowingly simple. Tools like Trezor and Ledger wallets are incredibly intuitive.  Theres really no excuse here. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:11:05
Wow, that guys post history is crazy.  He has some real problems he should be looking at (outside of bitcoin). 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:30:26

I'm not arguing about the best way to raise money here. I'm simply saying of course people are interested, because, money. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:51:56
You're crazy.  I like you, but you're crazy. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 21:32:45
Sweet mother. You're arguing that people take ethereum seriously because it  has high developer interest. I'm saying the reason it has high developer interest is because people can (and are) make a crap ton of money writing software for it.  Of course that's relative! It's the single reason!! If the money was in crapcoin 2.0 instead, then it would have the developer interest, not ethereum. You can't side skirt it with some "oh everybody wants money therefor that's not relative, that can't possibly have anything to do with my statement that developers like it". Buh...? 
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:09:02
Mycelium has a "buy with credit card" which just links to  and passes in your wallets key. Anyone try this? Seems to be closed right now anyway. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:33:22
Thanks Your service was second to none. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 20:31:28
Sure, it most definitely has high developer interest, no doubt.  There's interest because a few developers and an idea can make a shit ton of money,  simply by creating some new ICO/DAO on top of ethereum.
@_date: 2015-08-29 10:52:35

Dude. You are horrible at research.  You are so far off its not even funny.

Don't waste your time on this guy. He's got issues.  
@_date: 2017-04-08 12:23:07
I'm convinced there are about 15 to 20 actual active people there. And they are all either paid or absolutely crazy. I can't see a rational person posting the stuff I read over there, nor can I justify the upvotes they get. Of course, they say the same about us. Good times. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 12:19:13
But you're probably not overseas. And, you have little exposure. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 09:59:56
So what's your better option? Or do we wait until bitcoin is worthless?  
@_date: 2017-04-05 20:47:04
For a nerd he's not very intelligent. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 20:10:12
Aren't they kind of holding segwit hostage until they get their bigger blocks first? If that's the case, I have a whole lot of issues with them. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:25:17
Umm ya? That's kind of the point. 
@_date: 2016-09-05 23:10:23
Gotta start somewhere. There was also a time when fiat wasn't either. 
@_date: 2016-09-05 23:01:45
I have shoes. Can I pay in shoes? I mean, many people treat flat as a speculative investment - but my old stinky shoes hold the same basic value year over year. And I have them, hell, we all do. Why not just accept stinky old shoes instead of fiat? Seems to make more sense. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:15:57
Can you shed a lot of detailed light on how you arrived at your 90%?
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:43:50
agreed. I'm not sure he can even read properly. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:10:03
Ya, that's happened like hundreds of times so far, cause it's so damn easy to pull that off. And no one has been caught yet! Sounds super legit. Further, what if I use a Trezor, or multiple hardware devices, with passwords. Stored in a bank. So in x years when I go to withdraw (not to mention I'm the most non observant (and computer iliterarte) person in the world for not seeing you several times by now), I grab one of them from the bank. There is all of say 50k on it. You have to physically rob me before I move it, and get my password. And you made a whopping 50k (minus all your multi year expenses, so you really lost a lot) , if you can pull it all off. Or I just empty it from the bank itself so you're going to have to come in to get me. There are a zillion other ways around this. Anyone who actually has that much is hopefully smart enough to be careful. Hopefully. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:10:36
Ah but there's no worries if someone holds a gun to my head and makes me take them into my bank vault to get my private key though. Is that correct, or..? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:56:22
There have been and are plenty. None of which this crazyness has happened too. So, 0%.
You are better off making an ethereum ICO or some fishing website if you want to make quick money off others people's stupidity. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 10:00:34
Or perhaps the opposite.  Dude, this is a very established process tones of companies already use out there.  You are basically telling me bitcoin is useless. Take a look at bitpay, coinbase, coinkite, or any of the others. There are very simple and safe ways to plug in merchant side services directly to a website in no time. I made my own in a few days, it's been running for almost a year, over 8k transactions, only issue being the cash out process which is why these companies exist. Accepting bitcoin as a merchant has never been hard or complicated. And it's easier than ever now.  This isn't "confusing" and you won't "lose money".  Damn. Netflix doesn't do business this way for a bunch of reasons as specified in the thread... Not because of difficulty of implementation or ease of use.
@_date: 2015-09-16 16:16:12
Ah. I see. I will add - Anyone who gets confused when offered a couple options to pay for something, probably shouldn't be alive. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 21:51:52
We have tools and services in place to handle that...
@_date: 2015-09-16 10:27:19
I think we covered this. That's not my question.  The OP asked for Netflix to add a one time movie payment option. I realize that's not the way it works,  for a bunch of reasons....but talking about recurring payment is not what he asked about here at all. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 19:54:21
We can program automobiles to drive themselves. I'm sure adding an option  to pay for a movie is not really that difficult. The technical aspect is laughable.. It's all the other things people have mentioned in this thread that are show stoppers. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 20:05:26
So... In this case anyway... The latter? 
@_date: 2016-10-17 00:20:56
I see. Makes sense! Sounds like they are in beta, so hopefully this changes. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 10:06:47
Asking honestly, how is it really complex? We're talking two options here, not a hundred. Although, I doubt they would do this would from a business standpoint, I get that. Also not sure they would choose to go the route of offering an option to pay per movie. 
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:53:23
Or perhaps he is a she. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 13:14:40
Looks unlikely. Unless you know something... 
@_date: 2015-09-16 01:09:46
Aren't we talking about one off movie rentals here, no recurring payments involved? 
@_date: 2016-10-16 22:50:55
I'm just learning about this service now. It sounds amazing. I hope it's successful and sticks around!
@_date: 2016-10-17 00:08:42
Ah. It reads to me like $1 per month (big whopee) and 1% conversion fee (pretty decent).  Are you adding in this 3% on foreign transactions all the time then? When exactly is that applied? Is that on every use? If not, it seems alright, at least for purchases not including that 3%.. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:25:52
It's under a Jihan attack. Which is way worse than spam. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:40:41
You mean when demand drops.  This isn't the $4 he's talking about. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:03:06
This is probably the best option.
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:34:06
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:24:41
I sold a chunk of mine over the last few days. Is this the top? Beats me, it could go up 50% tomorrow for all I know. But it could also drop and never recover.  No one knows. How can I pass up this much free extra money right now? It's pure profits for me. I can do a lot with this extra money today. I say take some profits when times are exceedingly good. If you don't set targets you'll end up what.. Holding forever?  Need some kind of exit strategy. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 22:57:51
You buy bitcoins? In the opposite direction - If I walk in with 25k worth in  bitcoin you could cover that? In cash? 
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:50:02
Right. Did you even read the linked comment? Maybe pay attention to the order of things...  
@_date: 2015-10-28 19:39:45
It's still above IPO and running up to expectations for this early stage.  Am I missing something? 
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:47:45
If anything, he is trolling you. His argument of network wide leveraged costs holds no water to the original point of this thread - direct small transaction costs. You hit the nail on the head; it costs only pennies for both sides.  There is a subtle but significant difference in the way he's directing the math here.  The point being that for an outfit like Vimeo, bitcoin does makes sense. They are not suffering a $4 hit, nor are their customers. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:28:35
... This us the argument you're actually down to at this point? I think you need to rethink your stance here. Along with several other totally mislead individuals preaching the same totally incorrect shit over and over. Wake up. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 11:15:06
Yep, this works fine for me... 
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:16:39
Cool man. Do it up. I'll review. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 10:48:15
Not convinced being 35+ is considered a dinosaur.  But if so, watch out, you're not all that far away.

@_date: 2017-05-04 23:22:22
Pretty sure they'll pick up on the extremely obvious abnormality here at some point. Better off to pay now than risk it.  You really shouldn't recommend or even lean to the tax evasion suggestion here...
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:36:23
Like, say, get a random guy to stand beside them while they look all homeless and hold a "BITCOIN ONLY" sign, tomorrow?  
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:11:52
Some interesting math, and not incorrect.  Only the wording is confusing.  To be clear, it doesn't cost person A $4 to transact with person B, instead it costs virtually nothing.  But the network effect means $4 is absorbed.
The more transactions the lower that $4 number which seems counter intuitive to the direction your first question about why is it good for small transactions.  Not to mention that really doesn't even make sense to begin with, I don't see a reason why this number matters to a business accepting small transaction values, it's not like they pay $4 each time, nor does the spender.
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:35:12
I guess,  if you're into additional fees, more legwork, limits, and less privacy than ya, I see your point there. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 10:44:42
Unfortunately, we might not have time to wait for "eventually".

Sending a bunch of cash halfway around the world is fast, cheap, and secure now? 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:27:14
75k is not small. They go after much lower amounts, if they can find them. Eventually. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:24:27
Well, thanks everyone else.  For me it costs almost nothing to transact. And I'll admit,  I have not contributed directly to this "whole" thing. I guess I'm special, or, headed for a bit ban.

That's not a pre mine dude. That was a pre sale, IPO, in which anyone could freely buy in. Not just the Ether devs here. Might want to read up a little more before throwing out insanely incorrect numbers as fact.
