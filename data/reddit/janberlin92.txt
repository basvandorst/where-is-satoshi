Beside the great (partially) resident projects ([Room77]( [NBT]( [Vaultoro]( [Bitwala]( [Fractal]( [BigchainDB]( [Fulmo]( [Gnosis]( [Lisk]( [license.rocks]( [SatoshiPay]( to name only a few) many cool meet-ups take place in Big B.
Have a look [here]( about the LightningHackDay Meetup Series.
IOTA and Ethereum are somehow located in Berlin, but for me they are run mostly on a global scale.

Room77 supports Lightning payments.
the other merchants are probably still unsure and asking why to support other than VISA network with extra costs.
Berliners are cash-lovers. Adoption in "Digital Money" is a tricky thing in general here.

I would buy gold right now and a small portion of BTC when the bottom has reached (in a month or so...)
once BTC has reached your favourable disposal price you could directly buy allocated gold with your BTC here [vaultoro.com]( . No need to carry in your pocket. I'd rather not risk carrying around it all the time.
