Think of it like your email address. You can give that to anyone, but you don't give your password up. The password is your private key, so don't give it to anyone and write it down in case your computer or phone dies. 
A Bitcoin wallet is two keys, public and private. Show anyone your public key and they can send you funds. Show anyone your private key and they can take them.
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:33:36
I agree with you on that, well said! But the private keys issue is a good point also. I use bitreserve because it's an excellent service but the Bitcoin aspect of it is a very basic version which dosnt yet take advantage of the full value of Bitcoin. This could be because it's expensive and or difficult of course.

I've bought physical gold this week, and Bitcoin. The price of gold has dropped but the important thing to note is that is the paper price, not the physical price. While there is no shortage of paper gold, which is derivatives sold on derivatives sold on derivatives, when the shortage of physical gold becomes apparent there will be a sudden moment of realisation. 
China has all the gold, basically.

Bitstamp is back up later today, that's pretty good news but you have to get registered so you may miss the cheap coins. Btce is a bit dodgy but its alive. If you want alt coins then use mcxnow or vicurex. Mcx pays interest on your coins every six hours so there's that. Vicurex has most good alts. 
If you're just after bitcoin then bitstamp I guess. If you've got a wallet from blockchain.info then you can buy from anywhere.

As in a response to another comment, this for me is simply leaders rallying their troops. Behind closed doors they are all committed, one cabal, easy to frogmarch, easy to make a call to a local legislator or a judge who they play golf with. What's hard to control is little doubts spreading, and obviously their own customers are starting to question their stance. This isn't about sounding bullish in public this is about keeping their dogs on the leash. 
Make no mistake, these people are leaders of the free world because they knifed their way to the top, seizing weakness of the previous incumbent and removing them from the equation, harder than the rest. They are perceived to have this power like all finance moguls by their own team to have earned their spot at the very top. When the threat casts doubts, their power is questioned. So when Bitcoin casts doubts, in such a transformational way, their power must be exercised not on the poor sap they trod on to make the step upwards, but on doubters beneath them. And the only thing that can happen if these doubts don't go away is more and more stamping on fires. 
What they mean by considerable resources is, they've got dirt on people and could even kill to make this threat clear. But ultimately that won't stop anything because the technology is watertight. As long as the system is secure these guys have no argument anymore. They are done, the revolution has happened.

Correct, you may not agree with taxes or some aspect of them but that is different to evading your obligations. A business for example would have to provide full audits regardless, as would an individual when asked. 
I would imagine its more difficult to avoid tax with bitcoin. With cash there is less evidence, slightly, that money changed hands. Of many ways to avoid tax, few of them are illegal. I find it interesting that the Chinese have been caught using tax havens in the British Virgin Islands and part  of the £6bn avoidance of Vodaphone in the UK recently was facilitated by simply not bothering to go to the islands to physically see the paperwork, instead relying on fabricated and doctored forms which showed incorrect details. With bitcoin this seems more difficult to achieve as the paper trail is Internet/blockchain based and therefore location is less of an issue. Although I'm sure it's not going to take long to find a way to avoid tax with bitcoin, it won't stop the British government looking the other way when their mates need a favour

It will take time though. Two small former soviet countries have decided bitcoin is a risk in regards to capital flight? That does not surprise me in the slightest. Both of these stories today are more in line with the capital control narrative of recent weeks and I would hazard a guess they won't be the last. 
Places like these are havens for tax purposes and many European billionaires keep their arms and property portfolios there along with their ex-soviet soldier bodyguards. If their main product is threatened because they simply are not needed you can expect hostility. Do not underestimate the power of entrenched organised crime. 
Give them some time to come around. These were horse and cart economies just 20 years ago and have benefited from EU expansion but they have only just got their heads around it.

For significant amounts use cold storage/paper wallet which is generated offline on a computer with no internet access. Its easy enough, it does take a little time, but the point is if your keys are on the Internet someone will eventually steal them.

Definately not sure if serious. 
I can send bitcoin via email. Or by text/SMS. There is not a bank on earth that allows this, the technology cannot exist on these formats for traditional banking. All you need is a computer or a web enabled phone, which means the 5 billion people on earth without a bank acocunt because banks are banned ( Zimbabwe ) or because the nations credit rating makes them not worth bothering with, can now use the blockchain instead for storing or moving money. 
If you cannot grasp this basic shift in technology there is little point continuing with this farcical argument

Problem with gox is, as an exchange if it goes and vanishes with people's coins then those coins will be lost forever. It fundamentally lowers the supply of coins that can ever be traded. I've given up on my coins in there. It taught me never to keep substantial amounts online: I went and immediately put everything I could into cold storage. 
So, while gox crash reduces supply and therefore price should go up, it undermines confidence. Buying and trading should be a small part of bitcoin, it should be spent not hoarded but it's been decided that exchanges have the power in this early stage of publicity. Currently bitcoin is a victim of its own success. 
Therefore, the gox crash is a price correction, nothing more. We just need it to either solve its issues, or disappear quickly so we can get on with building the new infrastructures.

As bad as MasterCard or visa can be for money laundering and fraud on a global scale, the problem for me is that credit is essential for nations to exist. To be able to borrow is absolutely fundamental to any economy. There will always be a credit facility in a supply and demand system and I expect Bitcoin will develop a system to provide this function. So the middle man in this instance is not MasterCard, but credit itself and so takes on a different meaning. 
It seems to me Credit companies are most definatley struggling to maintain their turf ( or have seen some writing on the wall at least). Credit won't be made obsolete, just the form it takes. And in the meantime alot of jobs will go and very well paid positions made obsolete.

I don't think his main argument that bitcoin is small can be a platform to base the rest of his arguments. Yes, its small and is volatile but by limiting his description to just currency comparison he's going to miss the main selling points of transparency and cost. The recent volatility is occurring because of speculation but people have been speculating for less than a year at this point, there is a long way to go until the other functions he describes meet other areas of technology. The stress test is still bringing good results such as the gox admissions of failure and different jurisdictions begin to assess thier responses. 
By not mentioning the blockchain, it's difficult to take a financial report on bitcoin seriously. Frankly I'm starting to wonder if I should be at Jp Morgan instead of these guys

I also think this is massive news. The main issues for BTC are hoarding ( because everyone is speculating at the moment ) and the price is artificially high ( again only currently) because your average bloke such as my mate who's a local political activist just isn't interested in speculation or capitalism, he just wants to work, get paid and improve his area by knocking on doors. The bottlenecks created by the frankly medieval exchanges like gox and BTC-e, combined with daily limits and difficulty getting verified, mean that as soon as the floodgates open the price will initially drop. 
So, if a person can get rid of their hoards, or part of it, instantly on a format nearly everyone knows like the back of their hand, it will become the biggest exchange very quickly. All PayPal and ebay need to do then is match the charges to the current exchange levels and they will take over. 
That's the angle I see with ebay/PayPal trying this. They want to become the brand exchange and dominate bitcoin. This could be seen as good or bad, but the mainstream isn't gox or BTC-e which are shit, untrustworthy headaches.

I think if every article with such confused comment generates 1 person to investigate for themselves further even in 10,000 who say "I wouldn't touch bitcoin after reading that", then its definately a positive thing. 
It's such a positive thing that I can't quite believe these negative articles are merely talking the price down for no reason, like print isn't a business. Its so that they can buy more for themselves, so they sensationalise a story to generate clicks, or click through affiliates. Print newspapers are a casualty of the 90s, if they want to start making money again this would seem like the micropayment solution they have been waiting for. Take power back from advertisers, start actually reporting the news. Radical idea!

I also think ( for what its worth ) the current internet will be superceded by another.

I don't agree at all. He was asked a straight, gentle question and his answer was totally correct to the point of banality. The question asked was 'is bitcoin coming for your job?', and he answered both personally and professionally that a) there will always be a role for monetary policy and b) he has to think of his family's future. There is literally nothing wrong with what he's said. 
I think there is an implication in the example he describes that the problem of banks issuing thier own money has been solved. But what he's talking about is the full limits of bitcoin, and a government not having a monetary policy as per the question is not going to happen, in his view. 
It was a light hearted question and he's answered it fairly.

Exactly. The problem is Bitcoin is such a radical system and credit so entrenched in its current form. Global remittance is trillions per day, every penny charged a % to some finance mogul. It's got so big that banks require bailouts instead being allowed to collapse after their own mistakes, such is their position in our economies. An orderly transition of power is the hallmark of democratic transfer of power, I don't think credit card finance is remotely ready for such a transfer so a disorderly transfer is inevitable. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:20:20

True! I can't imagine sellers relisting whenever the price changes though, I reckon they will put in some kind of current price buy? I mean if the price goes up suddenly the seller will relist, and if it drops they will also have to relist as another seller could immediately undercut them.

To you in your vanilla world you can imagine people throwing rocks at televisions or burning down Internet cafés for witchcraft, but in the real economy it won't take more than six months before someone thinks 'what if we can raise money online' and is able to convert that into dollars for spending locally.

I think BitGold is excellent, I've been using it for a short while and it's totally fine. I think generally the crypto community has to come to an understanding with gold, as in physical gold not the paper gold but that will happen as the sector matures I hope. So far my thinking is that gold is the final resting place for your finances, not as a intermediate step and what you do is have a percentage of your worldy assets in different levels of liquidity, with gold being the thing you have in your hand, the least liquid form you can have. This goes with the adage that if you don't have it in your hand it's not yours, it's just a promise. BitGold uses various locations to store your gold in the same way goldmoney does, only with a fraction of the checks and ID requirements and with hardly any limit, or lower limit to purchases; I bought about 20p worth made of tips from reddit recently and you certainly can't do that on the old gold money website as I've tried. 
So what we have now is a very easy to use, but still a step from owning physical gold, system. It will obviously suffer the same doubts as owning any paper gold but that certainly isn't specific to BitGold. I do worry about how stable it is obviously, it's still a startup using Bitcoin as a way of increasing people's exposure to tangible assets as a hedge against the absurdity of paper gold. The fact that Bitcoin is permanently liquid means you don't really want to store all your Bitcoin in BitGold, but use it as a part of your holdings. 
I don't know I'm rambling and as usual on Saturday night I've had some wine. My other concern is the website is a bit buggy. 
As opposed to bitreserve which pegs your btc to gold or silver, or platinum or whatever, you can actually get exposure to paper gold with bitcoin with a mind to getting it UPS to your house. Or, you can spend it on the credit card thingy, which feels a bit retrograde but these things take time and effort to develop. 
I also look forward to invoices in gold. If I could get paid in gold and withdraw the value in Bitcoin, it would be much more stable. This is a good thing. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:22:04
Very good option imo. You get the advantage of liquidity with a full reserve bank style system, holding gold through btc or traditional funding methods. If you cash out there's btc or physical gold. It's the best option I've seen apart from having the gold in your hand, and the prices they charge are very low.

@_date: 2015-05-06 12:23:38
Well firstly, don't be distracted by the exaggerated sentiment. 
For an ounce of gold at $1200, offering $1 seems to me rather tokenistic; I can put my 1200 into say, btcjam or other peer to peer lending and generate, for free, $1 a week. I can then send that $1200 plus $52 in btc to something like bitgold or bitreserve and store it as gold for free before redeeming it as physical gold. I can put my $1200 into bitfinex and lend it as swaps for a good return, at a high risk obviously. I wouldn't take this route, I have no idea about trading analysis. But the point is, gold is an unproductive asset - a much better plan would be to make more dollars in a fluid currency like btc before putting profit into gold in order to get a single $1 btc reward. 
As it stands, this offer is probably one of the worst out there. I'm not saying it's not welcome, lots of people will be introduced to btc and that's cool. I just think your money turns into gold, not the other way round. So why would anyone need the incentive? 
Hope that makes sense.

I suppose if you had to draw a comparison of cost Bitcoin would probably win hands down, but yes you are right. The real dividing line isn't for me the cost of transferring and the services banks provide though, banks can offer those services and have done since for ever at a small cost. For me the advantage is being your own bank, not having to ask permission to have an account, and therefore the services btc provides are charged direct to me as opposed to buried in a balance sheet somewhere. For example you need a deposit to open any bank account, and most accounts require you to deposit a certain amount each month in order to keep interest preferential on deposit. In some countries we are looking at negative interest rates which would be laughable even years ago. And what happened in Cyprus should worry everyone if you consider the paper economy is almost out of steam.

I'm not sure this is 100% correct.

I'm in Bitcoin capital 1. I've had a dividend per day for about 160 days, which has been getting lower as difficulty increases continue. They are focused on mining payouts, using the initial capital raised for mining and investing in crypto projects which will earn their own dividends longer term. 
With the increase in value of Bitcoin since the start of the payouts, those early payouts have obviously rocketed in value but recent payouts are about half what they were at the peak. I'm very confident in ROI over three years thus far but I'm only a small investor. I will almost definately go for BC3, but in a lean month I'm waiting to see if that will be possible.

It won't be a safe haven until it's a stable technology and in its price. That's the whole point of a safe haven. At the moment it's a parallel to the dollar even if it's superior technology and a leap forward in many respects.

That's all I use it for, I have gold, silver, platinum and palladium balances. I have family in australia and was considering sending money this way using the Australian dollar option but they don't use Bitcoin - a wire transfer out to a bank account assuming the fees were low enough would be welcome. 
My main problem thus far is its not clear how recently the prices are updated. If I wanted to move to a safer currency I think timing is important so I can't use it for that. Small problem I guess

come on guys, youre buying CNN now? gold will return when the coming interest rate rises fail, the 'price' is falling because of the long overdue rate hikes but the reason we havnt had hikes is because they cant actually raise rates in a deflationary period. physical gold and silver sales are rocketing.
gold is 100:1 paper to physical suggesting a major problem.
gold will also outlast the internet and it cant be stolen by cyber criminals, although paper gold might be. it may not be as useful against bitcoin anymore for obvious reasons but it has industrial and sentimental use. bitcoin does not have either although it is growing.

Isn't it just a case of strength against the dollar? As in, the metals are getting punished because the dollar is seen as a safer bet, rate hikes keep getting pushed back but they can't be held forever. The Chinese stock exchange is tanking hard, the euro worries aren't getting any more solved. 
Bitcoin is not a relevant comparison to precious metals at this time, the only real chart you need is the BTC price vs dollar, which is showing growth in BTC after a year and a half drop from an all time high, a very positive sign although you could argue adoption needs a lower price ( people hoard if an asset is appreciating).

There's a couple of ways you can grow with very low risk. Bitfinex and Poloniex offer currency swaps where you lend your BTC to traders for a small charge. At the end of the loan term (2 days) you get your BTC back plus the charge, or you can compound (auto renew). Polo is currently around 20% APR for BTC but much lower for altcoins because there's no demand, I think bitfinex is a bit lower than 20%, I'm sure someone can confirm. 
You can also offer micro loans on bitlendingclub or btcjam. They have a credit rating system, obviously the higher risk, higher return applies but if you do a little work you can easily filter the bad borrowers out yourself. 
Or you can learn how to trade. Trading view is complicated but once you get your head round it it's essential. But it's basically no better than roulette unless you are rain man. 
I also use bank to the future which has certain requirements but is currently looking a fantastic investment thus far. I'm getting daily Bitcoin payouts so I'm expecting ROI in under five years. Bitcoin Capital for example just bought a chunk of shapeshift and bitreserve shares, which is very exciting and there are still shares on offer. 
I basically try and take as low risk as possible. But no risk means no return.

The spv just checks for confirmations to validate. With non spv, you're basically checking the entire blockchain history. Obviously this is going to take a few days now a the blockchain is much longer than it used to be. This way will mean it's going to be more secure and more trustworthy but if you have a mobile you don't want to analyse the whole chain or use a full node every second of the day while using Bitcoin. It's just not practical, for memory, battery life, data costs, phone lifespan.

Nobody's forcing you to though. It's like any new technology, you read into it and make your calls. Personally I think a handful of alts will have utility but I've also lost alot of money in the past year on alts which may not recover, sadly. 
It's about risk. Bigger the risk, bigger the return. If you gambled on BTC at this stage of maidsafe or storj, you'd be where you are now, don't gamble it's too risky. But look at the millionaires BTC created in the space of a few months, and that's when it hitm$1! If you've got £300 you can buy one BTC or a few thousand of a new coin.

Aside from you can spend some time on Trading View, work out the basic functions and follow their Bitcoin scrolling chat which has some really excellent charts and analysis (IE, type BTCUSD into the field and the chatbox should show you traders discussing Bitcoin events. ) Like all chatboxes your best advised to make your own mind up. Poloniex also has a chatbox and various trading tools so if you wanted to learn to trade with an altcoin before using the real thing. I mean trading a million dogecoin sounds alot, but it's £50. Not going to break anyone's bank, but beware the altcoin markets are heavily saturated with trading algos and you will get rinsed out if not very careful.

I've been thinking about this as well, for uk to Australia with the Australian end having no idea about Bitcoin at all. It should be as simple as 1) buy an amount of Bitcoin in a country. 2) send it to a different wallet. 3) give that wallet to your Australian counterpart (IE, send them the QR code). 4) they go to a Bitcoin ATM with that wallet and withdraw the cash. 
This method is not especially secure, but seems to be the simplest way. The last time I sent anything via PayPal to Australia they took a massive slice for doing essentially nothing except move numbers on a company database around. 
The ATM may also require a passport scan. At least that's what I found when looking at Australia's ATM network. 
In my view, the cost of using bitcoin is far far cheaper. It's the on and off ramp into local currency which costs, so check the sums. I'm almost certain it's cheaper to use bitcoin than paypal.

above comments are right regarding arbitrary time frames. today gold went up 2%, silver 5%, palladium up etc. because the US jobs data released today was a total disaster, as we enter a new quarter of data. many who follow the PM markets are commenting that the fundamentals suggest we are headed for a huge downswing. 
precious metals markets are a indicator of confidence in financial data, with higher confidence in gold representing a safe haven. with physical markets through the roof but paper markets taking heavy blows all year long, a strong surge in physical redemption as opposed to just closing a contract could mean rocketing gold/silver as the disparity becomes clear.

I find it strange that Halsey is so negative on Bitcoin. I've been using bitreserve for a while and it works really well, with my main criticism being that it doesn't really use the full scope of what Bitcoin is capable of. The big payoff is being able to peg your Bitcoin value to various currencies and metals and withdraw that value. This hasn't gone away, and it's still a great use case for cryptocurrency. But what I find odd is that Bitcoin is what makes all of this work, or perhaps a private blockchain better known as a database which allows it to happen. Whatever you call it, it's a very cheap way to buy currency and for example with your Beewallet you can withdraw these bitcoins in cash in Spain cash machines, presumably more will be added as the ecosystem develops. 
So now you can use a debit card to buy bitcoin as well, it's a really good easy way into crypto. Which makes me wonder why the bad mouthing of Bitcoin the currency, the enabling factor in bitreserves early success in my view. This enabling of debit cards makes it as useful as coinbase to me, private database or not I can instantly withdraw my Bitcoin from it and the full reserve is still intact for my other holdings. I already withdraw from Coinbase as soon as I can. It seems to me that this might be a tactical move to grab attention from both the angry Bitcoin crowd and the finance people looking at developing something slightly less apocalyptic to banking than bitcoin could potentially end up being. 
Also slightly related, they recently ran a bank to the future fundraising campaign, in which the Bitcoin mining group Bitcoin Capital invested a large share. So they can't really complain about bitcoin, it's just paid for this rebranding.

@_date: 2015-03-18 21:07:32
It's related to the commodities markets. For example, the American federal reserve today said it would not raise interest rates yet, and so the gold price rocketed while Btc dropped quite a bit. So you could speculate that there is a relationship beginning to form in this area. 
Also, as gold will probably remain the safe haven for a while, and you can buy precious metals with btc, it makes sense to trade between the two. Amagi for example lets you buy various metals. 
Personally I expect more gold/BTC articles as the global economy deteriorates!

journalism is a great use case for bitcoin, although easy to confuse it with PR. you can imagine all sorts of models emerging as print continues its death spiral decline

i use bitgold, by far the best current way to save in gold but not really for physical except that technically you can buy their brand of cubes and bars. bitgild is also ok but the postage costs make it not competitive compared to just spending cash at a standard online website. 
the international postage costs listed on amagi metals in the US are incorrect. if you email them you can see what the prices are but id imagine £15 minimum. they recently got taken over by another company so may be worth asking. 
AU trading listed on the wheretospend website is a absolute horrorshow and should be delisted.

The london banking sector will be looking for somewhere to stash their ill gotten gains, so hopefully some aml measures by our government will help. Unfortunately they have a disastrous recent record of regulation of the financial sector and our economy is pretty much in ruins for everyone except a rich minority. 
As others say, it's already regulated by math. As always the human element lets most systems down!

I think shitting is less frequent, what you want is high frequency power generation and then divide that reward between running the business and incentivising people to use your high tech toilet instead of the old fashioned way. 
Go for a piss, scan your wallet on the way out and basically get paid to use that toilet.

Hmm. One could suggest that despite the name, you do actually need surgery and the name of the hospital really should be the last thing on your mind whilst bleeding to death

Not entirely true. I've just had 3 tips from the new wallet system, of 10 bits, 10 bits and 60 bits. The minimum of 12 coins required to generate a tip only generates the 10 bit tip, but 15 coins gave me the 60 bits. 
So there's a difference in payouts is what I mean. 
Edit - my mistake. You can only generate a tip at 12 coins. So the payout level is seemingly random. Also, the first two have not shown up in my wallet so I guess too small to send due to transaction fees. Which i think means your chances are lower of a payout overall.

its bitcoin finance, its more like investing in companies in a traditional way but more bitcoin ecosystem focused. bitcoin capital in particular is paying dividends on a daily basis direct to a investors bitcoin wallet, storj have a fund there and a load of others too. you have to take a test to qualify as an investor but its easy enough, its designed so you appreciate you may not get any of your money back etc

Actually i also came to ask this. I've basically hammered the game all evening and collected many tips but only one has actually processed to my wallet. Perhaps a bug?

Not much will survive an EMP though, if it's big enough to take out the net then pretty much everything else will be screwed
