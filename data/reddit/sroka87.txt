I would buy what u can afford, you probably wont see price so low for a while.  Its always a risk, so dont put in more than you can afford to lose before doing some in depth research about the future of cryptocurrencies.

Actually, thats a good point.  I sometimes use Bitcoins to buy alts, but mainly because its a convenient on-ramp.  I dont think of it as spending Bitcoin however, as its simply part of the process for exchanges.  Fiat to Bitcoin to Alt.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:59:19
Yep - agreed.  My friend also bought some stuff via darknet, and the choice and quality was infinitely better than you could get on the street (unless you happened to live in Amsterdam).  
However, you'd have to be an idiot to use BTC (regardless of price) rather than a privacy coin on darknets in this day and age!

Why limit yourself to only BTC?  Thats a terrible way to run an online store.  I can guarantee that the majority of your addressable market would rather pay with fiat.  Have BTC payment (hell, why not include a few more cryptos as well) as an option, but dont ignore fiat unless u want to sink your store.
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:34:19
Yeah, youre right.  
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:30:41
Had a quick look on my mobile - nice store, with some cool tshirt designs!
However, i would only buy with fiat, as i dont like throwing away crypto on trivial items.  I have a hodler mentality, and would rather buy with fiat rather than an asset which has a high chance of appreciating.  In addition, its 10x easier to pay with a card online rather than with crypto

Theresa, is that you?

I'm with you on this one.  Halving will most likely have negligible effect on price this time round.  It's already been priced in.  Might trick a few rubes, but its just meme power now
@_date: 2019-11-07 13:27:11
Depends what your idea of fun is.  If it happens to be holding a digital currency that has the potential to revolutionize global finance, checking daily/weekly/monthly price fluctuations, getting depressed we're not on the m00n yet, second-guessing yourself whether you should invest in altcoins, then SURE, go ahead.
If not, just go bungee jumping a few times, or something...

If it came to it, i have ways to defend myself, and ones that are better suited to home invasion than firearms.  They take a lot more skill, training + bravery to use than a gun.  Believing u are safer owning a gun makes u an idiot.  All stats show u are not.

It could take a while as youve an awful lot to learn

This is a good question to ask!
 I see loads of people putting a lot of faith in a BOOM come halving, but I'd be inclined to say its already priced in.  The only thing that will take prices to a new ATH (in my opinion) is increased adoption, but I think the timeline for that is much more conservative, and could take +5 years before we see it being woven into the fabric of society.  Institutional adoption *could*  drive prices up, but equally it could keep them quite low, as for every institution buying a  load, there will also be those that will be selling a load, as they are quite conservative, so a return of 10-20% of their initial investment would be very tempting.
The majority of earlier hodlers came for the tech, stayed for the memes, and that's what newer investors need to start thinking about, not about $$$$s
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:26:59
My point is once their inside u may as well comply.  Plenty of ways to secure your home that are much more effective than firearms.  First in the list, as others have mentioned, being not to disclose your crypto holdings

Yeah, great idea Rambo.  Start a shoot- out vs four guys with your wife + baby in the xfire.  Suddenly uve lost more than crypto

If you are based in the 'Land of the Free, Home of the Brave', try heading to the Coinbase offices.  They have one in San Francisco, NY, Portland.  Demand to see someone who will listen to your case, and if not, serve them with some legal papers.

Erm, yes, they came for purposes of robbery, cos of poor op-sec, not motivated by some sort of pyschopathic rape-murder agenda.

Fixed his for you - Iota is centralised *for now*.  The Devs have explained why coordinator is in place (to prevent attacks on nascent network).  If it has not been removed when iota scales, then we can cry foul and label it as a centralised coin.
Also PayPal takes a fee, and iota is feeless, so I don't think that comparison holds either.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:25:18
Generally, u are correct.  However Monero (and other anon coins) do privacy better than BTC, as they don't have an open ledger.  I'm also keeping a close eye on non blockchain crypto like Iota, Radix which have potential for cheaper or even free fast transactions
@_date: 2019-10-04 08:43:26
If it falls in price don't freak out, simply dollar cost average down, and increase your stack a bit.  
Try to ignore M00N predictions of $100,000 BTC by year 20xx .  Instead get familiar with the reasons why this is technology is groundbreaking , and soon enough you will start to be very proud of being a relatively early adopter.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:02:20
If u do your research and don't invest in shit coins the chance of losing your investment is low.  The crypto  space is poised for rapid growth over the next few years, and anyone investing now is still an early adopter.  Putting your money in the coins I mentioned should result in growth long term, cos they are all great projects with real world usecase and strong Devs.  Sure someday grow faster and larger than others...
  Personally, I see more potential in the best ALTs than in BTC, which is why I advise not going all in on BTC.   It's a bit of a dinosaur when it comes to tech, and uninspiring when it comes to upgrades (although LN is promising).  It would be foolish not to have any BTC tho, as network effect of the first mover is still significant, and it's proving to be a great store of value.
Tldr; diversification is good mmmkay

@_date: 2017-11-17 10:31:08
1/4 BTC , 1/4 XMR , 1/4 ETH , 1/4 IOTA.
Diversify more chance of one of these mooning than just BTC alone
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:28:09
Ethereum is addressing this issue by moving to PoS.  
Is it possible for BTC to do something similar?  In this day and age it seems a bit ridiculous that the money of the future should also be environmentally damaging.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:36:27
Don't put all your eggs in one basket and fixate on an arbitrary number.  Better to own 10 BTC and 10BTC worth of decent ALTs.  This way you protect yourself from any shock or (god forbid ) failure in the BTC project.  You will still have a nice amount of BTC if it moons!

They would've gotten away with, if it weren't for that pesky open ledger!
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:00:22
I'm very interested to see Tumblebit in action.  It could be a game changer as no one wants to have all their transactions visible and linkable.  
Iota is indeed centralised , but if Devs are to believed the coordinator is a temporary solution to protect fledgling network.  I wish them all the best, as the tangle is very elegant technology for microtransactions

Monero is no more explicitly designed to aid money laundering than the dollar bills in your pocket are.  
Fungibility and anonymity do not equal criminality
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:40:39
If you are worried about remaining anonymous or being tracked thru blockchain transactions then Monero is your very simple answer.
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:17:01
Not this year, but who knows what the future holds.  The core tech behind Monero, ringct, actually has blockchain agnostic implementations being worked on, so watch this space

Very interesting - i hadnt given much thought to how Lightening could help obfuscation.  Its a nice solution on many levels!
