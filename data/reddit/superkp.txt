 appreciate that you wanted to give me advice, please use more tact with the other people you offer this advice to.
Next time, please don't assume that someone spends needlessly on weddings or gambling.
It's also pretty insulting that you called me horrible for having savings below X when I have a child. Might want to watch that next time you're talking to someone that is already emphasizing that their finances are fucked.
Yeah american healthcare is really *really* fucked. I'm actually kind of lucky - I actually get real healthcare for that much. I know some people that don't get good care and pay a similar amount.
I'm currently working on getting to the point where I can jump to a better job. I recently started an IT career so I've got a lot of growth available, BUT I also started as a contractor so I had to jump around different jobs for a while. So I am stuck at my current job until enough time passes that I don't look like I'm hopping too often.
Self education is easily rolled in to the internet bill I pay, especially since I need to learn more IT - most online resources are free. The certification tests I take get are rare enough that we use some of our savings.
Formal education has failed me. I have a BA in psych. For 6 *years*, I couldn't find even an entry level job within the industry.
I have a suit.
I am only going to be doubling my income by getting a better job, and that's not going to come from paying for more education - especially since I already have ~$35k in student loans. (another totally fucked american institution).

You're the one who started by using those parameters. I just did the math with them. I was just using the example you gave me.


Yes. That's what I'm saying. Technically I live above the poverty line, but so close to it that I do qualify for a bunch of shit.


My wedding cost me about $2000. Some of my family and my inlaws also helped out to a tune of ~$500. so my wedding was great at ~$3000. Out of all your assumptions, this is probably the most insulting.


Where do you even get this shit? No. We spend a little out of our savings for gifts for family, and the once-every-2-year vacations are less than $1000. We might be poor, but we're not fucking stupid.


Holy shit. I was wrong. This is the most insulting one. 


OK. It'll be at the bottom.


Oh, I'll admit right now that I haven't always been great with money. I learned bad habits from my mom, and no habits from my dad. It took me 5 years to accept that I needed to get better with money and another 5 to get even close to being actually well-minded with it.
**YEAH. I GET IT. MY SITUATION IS TERRIBLE.** Do you not understand that life sucks for some people? I'm constantly afraid that either my wife or I will have a major injury and not able to keep working, affecting my child. I live a much less fun life because I am more averse to taking risks.


I have a feeling you grew up middle class, and someone taught you about money before you graduated high school. I grew up poor and the only thing I got was my mom mishandle every dollar she got.


Yeah, I graduated in 2011. During the worst depths of the financial crisis. 6 years later and I'm still "early on in my career"


I have *never* made this much money in a year. See before RE: life situations.


Sure, but if I got to where you are, it would be pretty fucking impressive, becuase of how far behind I started.
The math of my budget:
Income (rounded to nearest 100 for ease of use, and these numbers are *after* taxes are taken out): 
Me: $1200 every 2 weeks
Wife: between $450 and $550 twice a month. We'll average it to $500 every 2 weeks.
Total per month: $3400
I'm going to use August as the sample month. I am going to modify bills that are monthly but still change to the average (example: utilities, COBRA payments)
Anything that I have *italicized* is something that I am grouping under "Life Issues" that are either in the past and I am still paying for, or in the present that I have to continually deal with.
Rent: $825 (*really* fucking cheap for a house big enough for all 3 of us)
*Storage unit*: $65 (needed this to store and treat bedbug-afflicted items)
Hobbies: $30 (some computing stuff and some knitting)
Groceries: $438 (this includes diapers and similar regular needs)
Fast food: $151 (yes. this is a sore spot in my budget. Even if it were 100% eliminated, it would still be pretty far 
from what you are describing I should be at)
Gas for cars: $158 (we both commute)
Daycare: $400 ($50 per day, twice a week, every week)
*Healthcare*: $650 (I'm on a COBRA plan from an old job. This would be about 1/3 the cost if I had a decent plan 
through work. But I don't.)
*Paying old healthcare bills*: $100 (even on ~good~ great plans, they don't pay for everything. Going to be 
paying this much for at least the next 6 months or so.)
*Credit Card Payment*: $25 (I italicize this because most of the debt on it is due to the bedbug situation I am 
finally out of, or a healthcare bill -paid separate from the other healthcare cost listed)
Utilities: $135 (water paid quarterly, electricity and gas averaged and paid monthly)
Cable: $50 (no other choices in my area)
Phones: $76 (2 phones with minimal plans at $38 each/mo)
Other costs: ~$100 (birthdays, parking meters, other incidental costs.)
EDIT: OH SHIT. I FORGOT ABOUT MY STUDENT LOANS: $80 (after being reduced to an income-based repayment plan)
And finally, the $200 for savings.
That totals to $3403 by my calculations. Some months I get an extra paycheck. That's our "big bills" months. Eliminate larger medical bills, do big maintenance on the car. Things like that.

eidt: grammar
I can't tell if you're a troll or an asshole.... r/gatekeeping
 let's do the fucking math.
Minimum wage job in my state (ohio) pays 8.15. Part time hours are usually considered anything less than 35/week.
That's $285 per week. Let's say they lose 10% to taxes (which is a *little* generous). so $256 per week. (I'm rounding down to the nearest dollar, btw)
That comes out to $1026/month.
The cheapest apartment I have ever lived in in my town was $525/month, utilities not included.
Let's say you have cheap utilities and only pay 100/month for them, including water, electric, and gas.
Then 50/week in food - this is pretty bare bones. Boring sandwiches for lunches and half-way interesting dinners.
My town is pretty well dispersed, so everyone drives. $100/month for minimum legal insurance, and 75/month for gas because your car sucks.
Then you get student loans - and lets say it's on an income-based repayment plan but not the best one - after all if you only have a minimum wage job, then your luck is pretty shit. $100/month
But we left out the phone! And internet! How can you invest in bitcoin with no internet?
I have the cheapest phone plan I know of, and a close-to-basic internet plan. 38/mo for the phone and 50/mo for the internet.
The rest of it you dump as fast as possible in to bitcoin. roughly *negative* 12/month is left for this.
**So you fucking tell me where a person on minimum wage working part time is going to get paid $12 per month in bitcoin.**
I'm married and have a full time job. My wife has a part time job. Both are significantly above minimum wage. We also have a toddler.
We don't have an emergency fund, because being poor is really fucking expensive. Cars break more often. Kid gets sick. Your wife *develops* a gluten sensitivity (how the fuck does that even happen?). You get BEDBUGS and have to trash 80% of your furniture as you move out.
After our medical bills, Student loan payments, daycare, fixing the fucking car, and so forth, We can save about $200/month. when we get done with medical bills, it's going to go up by about $150/month.
We put that in to a traditional savings account, because it only has $1000 in it - and we are filling up our emergency fund before *anything* else, becuase the principle is that **you only buy as much crypto as you can afford to lose.**
So fuck you saying that I've got spending issues. I have life issues. And they are fucking expensive.

As someone who is currently saving in order to get in to crypto, sometimes low amounts is all you can afford, and you gotta accept high % fees in order to play the game at all.
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:30:23
Careful man. you don't want to get caught with funds when you aren't paying on your student loans.
I am paying mine at a reduced rate at the moment.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:56:29
Dude seriously?
I have maybe 5 people that are my age (late 20s/early 30s) that have a bunch of extra to just dump in to investments.
And even they probably wouldn't do more than $100/month.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:02:16
I would suggest everyone in this thread go watch the Extra Credits short series on the history of paper money ([link to 1st of 6](
It's very enlightening, and I could easily see part 7 being about crypto.
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:27:42
Yeah I know. It just really bugs me when assholes like this tell me that I'm not working hard enough.
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:44:48
Well, I'm certainly not using any braindumps for the certifications. I'm already in a shaky financial spot - I don't want to invalidate what I've got.
Currently I'm studying for my next cert and making a point to [insert my next employer here] about my ability to keep with it, by staying at my enough-but-not-alot of pay job for at least 6 months.
As far as 'willingness to jump ship' goes, I've considered myself a mercenary from day 1. If anyone ever offers me more money, I'm taking it.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:45:04
Is this where we talk about cars on moons?
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:48:48
Educate yourself. It's not hard, but it's also not simple.
I'm in kinda the opposite position though. I'm educated enough that I know what I'm going to do once I get the cash to spend on it, I just need the cash first.
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:50:57
You aren't keeping you secret very well.

(there is no company to *have* a CEO, b/c bitcoin is decentralized. The top comment is joking about what critics in the economics/finance sphere have said about bitcoin.)
