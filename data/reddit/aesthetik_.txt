Merchants accept fees becuase they are a necessary evil to receive payments, and they can generally pass them back by raising prices slightly - although some make the surcharge transparent and charge it directly. Often forced by regulation.
Consumers without credit cards pay higher prices and subsidise those who do have them.
Consumers use credit cards for convenience, and those who use them the most are rewarded with points and benefits - paid for by other consumers  and merchants from the interchange fees. Bank issuers and merchant acquirers also benefit in the Visa/Mastercard model, and even more directly with the Amex model. 
Honestly though, this is an old platform and new payment paradigms are emerging - most rapidly in China and south East Asia.
In the same way that instant messaging became "free" - I expect payment fees to rapidly go to zero, or even negative (where a consumer is rewarded for making payments), due to the ecosystem value of capturing user engagement and payment stream data. Look at platforms like Wechat, Grab and GoJek for examples of this model.
We are already starting to see this type of marketing with Alipay and other digital wallet type services as they aggressively push across Asia. And it's only going to get more competitive. 
In a world like this, crypto payments will struggle for mass adoption, unless we can present a viable privacy alternative, or provide convenience that others can't. Or people start to get concerned as large payment oligopolies form, as we are seeing as Chinese domestics push beyond  their borders. 
Interesting times.

I've been doing a lot of thinking about this. I live in Hong Kong and work with Fintech partnerships across 15 markets in Asia including China, Cambodia, Philippines, Indonesia etc.
I personally think payment margins will go to zero, and then negative in relatively quick fashion... Right now it's an acquisition strategy. But if we follow the India model to it's conclusion, payment banks become a loss leading mechanism to gain customer data, engagement, and to sell more profitable financial products. It's a question whether crypto will be able to compete in this context with only a payments utility.
Imagine a Grappari network topping up a dash or lightning wallet or similar - where does the incentive come from? These are often family businesses that use it for a second source of income. They'll stick to what pays them the most fee income or commission.
I'm super interested in what DeFi and open accessible finance (debit/credit/protection) means for South East Asia, but I don't have a clear narrative for how crypto payments might compete with G Cash, Alipay, Linkaja, GoJek, Kakao etc. in the near term.
They will always have a larger ecosystem and a more compelling use case and incentive structure for "digital cash" and payments.

Developing countries have as much, if not more to gain from crypto adoption.
It is down to individual regulatory bodies and OJK is relatively conservative, even within the region. 
The guidance as I understand it is similar to MoF in Vietnam, affirming that the central currency is the only currency valid for payments. 
This is not a ban as such, but is relatively tight as a market position, designed to slow adoption. Others in the region are viewing it more as a commodity, or even positively embracing it.
Look for Bank Negara in MY and MAS in SG to lead this thought leadership, and ID will consider whether their approach is relevant in time.
Just be careful with how you access exchanges, your disclosure requirements, and keep your crypto assets under your control at all times.

I know there are a lot of fundamental issues with the custodial model. But for small payments it's less of an argument - and it's the ONLY way we're going to get that first wave of adoption.
Wallet of Satoshi is also worth a look. Much more polished than Blue Wallet from a UX perspective. But essentially the same thing.

I hope so, but if we want mass usage: people with iPhones who just want to pay &gt; people who want to run their own node to fully secure a hot wallet.
So I'm not totally against the model. Even the most hardcore arguments for decentralisation tend to fall a bit flat when we start talking about second layer solutions (as long as layer one is decentralised and secure).

This article is so poorly conceived, it may be trolling. 
The issue is not with distributed ledgers as a technology but the existing systems and legacy architectures it is being forced to exist within in this use-case. 
Unfortunately for SWIFT, if they don't do the hard work to re-design their platform, they won't be able to compete with modern platforms like Ripple for RTGS.
But no, DLT should not be used to replace Oracle databases within an existing inefficient system. It's a stupid premise and a predictable outcome, that has been poorly reported upon.

*public block chain.
Private blockchains can use vastly simplified voting/consensus mechanisms as interests are aligned.
Private chains will see the most enterprise interest in the near term. In time I expect much work will be moved to public chains, but we are some years from scalable public infrastructure and many non-negotiable privacy features are still too early in development.
I still think OP is dramatising a false distinction between bitcoin and block chain. It's definitely not some kind of either or.

Valuation of assets is one of the darkest arts of finance, but to try and simplify my response - it could be represented as a combination of Present Value and Future Value.
Present Value (merchant adoption, wallet usage, core features, transaction volumes) sets a certain level of demand (with a known supply).
Future Value (risk of regulation weighed against potential for mass adoption, potential for future investment inflows, potential for price appreciation etc) has created the majority of the narrative of value, driven additional investment (speculative and long-term) and caused the increase in demand that has pushed price to its current levels. Yes, the network maturing, scaling and proving itself is helpful - but this is generally priced in, including the uncertainty of forks. The underlying utility hasn't changed dramatically from Pizza day until now, despite all the semantic arguments about currency, commodity, store of value etc.
I hope that's a clearer answer. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:49:22
Stating the obvious: decentralised cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and blockchain and distributed ledger technologies are very different domains. 
In fact JP Morgan has done a lot of ground breaking work for the development of the latter, including their Quorum fork of ethereum to make it usable for enterprise (private, permissioned) deployment.
So yes, he does and it doesn't contradict his statements on bitcoin (whether you agree with them or not).

Good analysis and article I thought.
The sentiment that the “speculative mania” has ended and we are now closer to long term adoption trend (or fundamental value as it is misleadingly called) is positive.
I think the view that this price level is going to persist longer term massively undervalues the demand soon to be generated by institutional money once mature custodial arrangements and greater regulatory certainty is provided through the second half of this year.

There is a real misunderstanding though that "wallets" "hold" bitcoin, because this is the natural analogy.
Yes it's a bit much to jump into key pairs and UTXOs, but we do need to do ensure this is made clear. Your private key/seed phrase proves ownership of unspent value. Your wallet is just a means of accessing that value and doesn't hold your coins. Seed phrases are the base layer of security and control of funds.

He's definitely not a mainstream media guy. He is very personally invested in ETH and BTC though, so like other early adopters he definitely isn't going to give a contrarian view that would sabotage that...

This is a great answer. Blue wallet is the simplest path, since they run the node and give you a simple interface over the top. Hardcore LN advocates will be skeptical of this model, but it's great to get started easily.
Shango is if you want to get deeper into spinning up and syncing to your own node from iOS - but it's test flight and testnet only still I believe.

A big short squeeze and a big clean out of these positions would be the healthiest outcome here.
Same as when people were buying at $20k, there must be a lot of people opening short positions below $3600 at the moment who have absolutely no idea what they're doing...

Then don't shitpost. I can't downvote you enough.

No, now you can only hope that you haven't compromised any other funds.
You're never getting 13BTC, that should be clear by now ��‍♀️

I mean the title.
The grammar.
Most of the sentences have such bad syntax that they are incomprehensible. Are they written by a bot?
“The main computerized cash enrolled comparable dimensions on Bitstamp and Bittrex.”
The fact that it's outdated.
The bizarre use of tense.
The lack of valuable information or insight, just a bot pulling together incoherent price data.
You want me to go on...?
Did you write this?

Correct, even the value of a 51% attack is far exceeded by the cost of ASICs.
The mechanics of the scenario OP describes just don't work.
Downvoted, this month more than ever we need facts not conspiracy theories.

The standard is defined by adoption.
Look at the number of BTC pairs on exchanges and how much daylight there is to any other coin/fork in second place.

Look at the previous run to new ATH, it's much shorter.
It's fairly idiotic to use this as a reference, especially as the fundamentals are very different.

Big news and a positive development.
