A new user making big claims with a template website with no real service/feature/etc.  I have my doubts.

Are you in the US?   I made a withdraw last week to my debit/credit card for $1000 and it was in my account in less than 24 hours.  It was nice.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:43:18
I don't like that my deposit to circle still shows pending but my bank account has cleared it.  I've opened a ticket and tried chat support and they haven't responded.
@_date: 2014-10-25 18:40:47
I had a nice win today on Video Poker.  I won 1BTC.  I spilt the withdraw up into two parts though and the bigger part is pending.   
...not to sound like a gambler but I need to transfer that back into my bank account pretty soon.  :O
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:46:32
Yeah, they are disabled. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:28:20
There is a fee.  It isn't exactly instant either.  I feel like I regularly wait 15-30 minutes for one confirmation.
@_date: 2014-10-27 14:15:32
This may be off topic but why does it seem like it takes longer to mine blocks later in the evening?  I swear, 3:00PM central time and blocks are popping up every 20 minutes maybe.  Late at night it can take an hour and a half. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:24:28
I was just looking into using them yesterday.  I'm glad you shared this information because I won't be using them now.  It really seems like an easy problem for them to solve with the information you have that you can give them.
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:14:53
There was one point yesterday where it took like 1.5 hours to get a single confirmation.  That's what I dislike. Then you look at the guy that mined the block 6 prior and did one transactions. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:18:02
I feel like this shouldn't be on here.
@_date: 2015-05-29 03:29:01
I pointed out various discrepancies in their support docs and FAQ when they were first opening up to the public (because their support would tell me one thing while their site had something completely different) and they corrected their mistakes, didn't say thanks and can blow me in the bathing suit area. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:47:50
You are probably a moron but he had 700,000 bitcoins, which were worth $13.4 million at the time of transactions but are worth $166,124,000 at current conversion rates.  Those are already in the hands of the government
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:30:16
Which was only Ross indirectly.   It would be like you getting a life sentence for driving someone to the dope dealer's house. You didn't sell them the drugs, you just gave them a way to get to the drug dealer.

You are taking a lot of heat lately but you provide a good service and it will only get better.  Keep it up, don't let the hate get you down.   You were the service I used to get my first bitcoin address and it really got me interested in bitcoins and helped provide a great place to start learning.

At the same time, 30 Million was stolen from Xoom and it's all cash.

Many casinos give you the deposit instantly but make you wait for 6 confirmations before withdrawing.
@_date: 2015-05-30 04:39:12

Instant cyrpto-coin exchange (no account required, no interaction with another human) is becoming pretty common.  I know you can do it at 777coin.com and fortunejack.com 
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:25:35
I feel like I run into this over and over with bitcoin businesses.
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:16:37
Yeah but...I hadn't heard of one case where coins were stolen from bitstamp...until it happened to the tune of 19,000BTC

The terms and conditions on the Target card from Gyft says you can't use it to buy other gift cards  but I've never tried.  I went last night with the app on my phone to try it out.
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:39:10
I think it happened at the end of 2013 actually.  
@_date: 2015-01-09 08:55:24
Yeah, Circle will let you use a debit card which is great because I don't have a credit card so I can only deposit using my bank account.  
I actually did an experiment between Coinbase and Circle this week.  I deposited via bank account to both places on Jan 4th.   I had instant access to $100 of my deposit at Circle.  The funds were available in my account on Circle this morning.  At Coinbase I have to wait until they put the funds in my account before I can use any of the deposit.   I still don't have the funds in my Coinbase account and the transaction p age says the funds will be in my account by the end of day on the 9th.   What really makes it annoying is that I know the transaction has already posted on my bank acount as does Circle (they released the funds) but Coinbase just seem to throw extra days in there to wait for no reason.
Look at these two images.  One shows that both deposits posted on the same day for both places.  The other image shows how on coinbase even their history for my deposit shows the deposit comp,eted on the 7th and that coinbase is just holding their thumb in their ass until the 9th to move the funds from them to mw.

This reminds me.   Remember when OKPay stopped taking BTC deposits?  Yeah, they just took the link to use it off of the customer account pages but if you had ever deposited BTC to OKPay you could continue to do so by sending whatever deposit you wanted to one of those old addresses.  So it looked like they were in compliance with the law but left that function up for at least another 6 months before they finally disabled it.

Garage Band is as well.  That's the only other one I've personally experienced.
@_date: 2015-01-08 09:52:21
I would use one of the automated crypto exchanges where you just send your BTC to an address and give the exchange your altcoin address and they send you the value.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:40:56
He knew because he had a problem with a withdraw or something I'm sure.  He suspected it wasn't isolated to just him so he made a tweet about it.  
Jesus, I bet you were part of that reddit group that "identified" the wrong Boston bomber.
@_date: 2015-01-08 07:39:30
That guy is trying to cover his ass now because he knows he is going to have a legal battle on his hands when his investors never see what they were promised.  I hope someone was documenting everything.
Does Paycoin have a blockchain where you can see how much accounts hold of the cryptocurrency?   Someone should make Garza show how invested he is in Paycoin by showing how many coins he still owns.   I would guess he sold when it was as high as he thought it would get and doesn't have many now but I'm totally guessing.    At least if he could show possession and prove to his investors that he is losing money daily as well it might make them feel bettter.
@_date: 2015-01-06 23:08:47
It doesn't look like I was in the top 500 but that is actually a known issue with Reddit.  I can tell from my end that I was poster # 142.

Yeah, I was 7.1.1 but wanted to play this so I finally upgraded to 8.1.2 last night and then jailbroke my phone.

Not 1=1 but you used to be able to get bitcoins for your karma from u/bitcointip.   You know, back when Bitcoins were a bit cheaper.
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:41:12
It already has one.
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:06:49
Doesn't the exact same thing happen with people using a credit or debit card?

The oldest tweet talking about withdraw issues was from:

second oldest (which also created a topic on reddit about it:

@_date: 2015-01-12 17:03:06
I'm glad you were able to get your coins back.  
@_date: 2015-01-06 07:33:45
Karma is a bitch.  I remember when bitcoins were around $100usd and some of mine went to another address owned by bitstamp but not by me.  They would do nothing to help so fuck them in the ass I'm glad they lost some money.  It sucks doesn't it bitstamp?

Yeah, all the haters need is a legit outage that lasts multiple days where no transactions can complete or something.
@_date: 2015-08-04 10:11:14
I thought I could make a nice $10 in BTC but I am unable to find anything that needs to be corrected at this point.    You can just send me $5 in BTC instead. :)
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:31:27
Can you help me understand this:
I can search for my btc address on blocktrail and blockchain.info  but both places show zero confirmations for 2 hours.   Shouldn't it show 2 at blocktrail because it has two more than blockchain.info?
and what does this mean for priority on blocktrail:?    3,666 &lt; 28,800,000
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:14:12
Thanks.  I was thinking the sky was falling with how messed up  it looked.
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:46:20
So now I have transactions in my local bitcoin wallet that show four confirmations but blockexplorer says the transactions don't exist at all.

So does/did she use Symbicort and the price was due to it being a non-generic, name brand? Maybe her insurance company uses Caremark for prescription coverage and they don't cover it because a generic is available or became available this year for much cheaper.
"Fortunately, Jackie has since found a way to obtain her maintenance inhaler without breaking the bank or the law, thanks to a helpful doctor and, of course, not our insurance company."
I feel like the solution here was for Jackie to tell her doctor,  "Damn doc, they want $300 for that medicine now"  a he just told her, "oh, yeah, it doesn't have to be the name brand.  This works the exact same and costs $10.  Just get it instead." and that the problem is has more to do with patents than health care.   I could be totally wrong but I would really like to know what drug, dose, specifics of what she was supposed to get just to see what issues I would run into while trying to make it affordable for myself.
This user in the comments section might have said what I was thinking more eloquently: "I just read an article from a reasonably educated person that opted to go to the back market instead of contacting his wife's doctor or insurance company for answers. The link posted had PDFs of what is presented to everyone signing up for these types of plans and is mailed to them after. They simply didn't read look at the charts with their simple explanations. People send more time picking a flight and hotel for vacation than they do getting insurance."

Your story has many similarities to mine.  I just want to get access to the 30,000XRP long enough to sell them for BTC but they are incompetent. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 07:15:06
...the support is pretty weak too.  They fucked up their stuff when they changed the login page around and now I can't access the 30,000 they gave me.   Fucking weak.

Did someone new buy them?  Originally they only had games they made and now it has "150 new slots".
