I’ve owned bitcoin for 6 years now.  I don’t use it as currency but I’ve derived a ton of utility from it.  I could trade it for currency at any time though.

It’s a commodity, not a currency.  It has always been this way.

It’s been an excellent store of value over that timeframe.  (I bought at $15)
Bitcoiners have always said “hodl”, consider that for a second.  
No one holds a currency, they hold commodities hoping they will have more utility/value in the future.
Bitcoin sucks as a currency.  It’s as bad to use today as it was in 2013.  
However, it’s world class as a commodity

Yes.  
Silver is a commodity that you can use to build electronics.  It’s also used as a store of value and has a value in dollar terms.  People invest in silver. 
No one uses bitcoin as a currency.  It’s used as a store of value.  You don’t “invest” in a currency.  You invest in commodities.  
Bitcoin is closer to silver in use case than to a dollar.

Ok. I’ll stop replying. 
I’ll keep on not using bitcoin as a currency and deriving utility from it.

Haha, yeah.  Right.  Tell me more about your “privacy”.   You don’t even have your own sovereignty, much less privacy.

Let’s test it. ...
Is google’s quantum computer good for bitcoin?
Ye....wait, they have a computer that can potentially decrypt SHA-256?  Shit.

Yeah, they make me weary.
