Just curious, what events will help make this happen? Or is it just from popularity rising and only bad news will slow it down?

Thanks for the tip. Also another question i was paid with bitcoin through blockchain, is it possible to move that over to coinbase?

Damn dude. Thanks for taking the time to explain everything. That was super helpful. When i get home this evening ill look a little deeper into everything. Ive been like a little child all day checking the bitcoin price every hour. Its so exciting watching it climb (hope it doesnt stop) but i am glad to be a part of this!
Youve helped sell me on this community, you could’ve easily just sent me a link or told me to google it but you didnt and i thank you for that. Sometimes redditors arent so friendly lol. Im sure i will have more questions, hope its okay if i just message you or something. 
Thanks again!

Wow. Wish i knew that before i spent 700 dollars. Im honestly trying to ride this wave for a while and earn some money along the way. This bitcoin community seems great, i asked a question and got straight forward answers with no criticism.. May i ask what your method is of buying and selling? I had someone pay me some money it bitcoin over blockchain, i saw that bitcoin was trending upward so i said screw it and downloaded Coinbase to buy some more. Now my bitcoins are in two different places. Id like to have them in one place where i could sell if i want to. 
Thanks for your help!
