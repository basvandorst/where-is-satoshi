Banks employ tens of thousands of people and create vast numbers of jobs. That is very important to remember. When bitcoin creates jobs and employs more people it will gain more political power. 
Big tobacco got a pass on health issues for decades because of the jobs they created.

I'm confused, is that good news for bitcoin or not?

Can we call it foreplay?

The trolls are the fun side of the bitcoin family and the people everyone wants to meet at parties. The rest are just cheap used car salesman looking for a commission.

Once the blockchain is downloaded, the transactions in your wallet should confirm. Is it still syncing with the network?

Before you begin, make backups of both wallets.dat and be careful. As long as you don't have another wallet.dat with coins in it already, you can just copy your old wallet.dat onto the new empty one bitcoin-qt created. Its in the %appdata% directory on windows, dig around in there and look for a bitcoin directory.

If you buy from Gox you may not receive your coins for a long time, if ever if you believe some of the stories here.

I don't consider these trolls any more than the BS on the front page. He has a small but loyal fan base who enjoy these posts.

Don't take all this so seriously, it's just the internet.
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:50:57
Difficult to believe. Did the gox transaction get any confirms before it disappeared from your wallet? The only plausible explanation is the transaction didn't confirm and was removed but that takes days not hours. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:28:42
No no no, they would never do that! I can't imagine why you would think they would.

The day the internet switched from being a private academic playground to being a public wasteland is the day all this started. I felt like you when millions of morons flooded usenet 20 years ago. I'm sorry we new people ruined your fun but mine was ruined already by trumpet winsock 20 years ago.

That would be difficult to generate. All coins appear dead until they move.

This sounds like it will end with a fool and his money are soon parted. You will have to trust two or more parties to be honest. I wish you the best of luck.

I worry every time I send coins. I remember being terrified of losing my stash when I consolidated a bunch of my wallets into one. Although I realize the odds are very low, there is always the possibility of losing it all due to error or being hacked.
This forum is full of stories of five digit losses due to poor security and or user error. It's a whole new level of responsibility with no safety net.

You have trained this community to troll hard with a vengeance against anyone who disagrees with them. This is  the epic battle they have been preparing for. The pols will cherry pick the threats they receive from the community and other scary ideas to use against you.

I was actually surprised last night someone trolled a bunch of "i just downloaded bitcoin" posts and people actually helped out. Losing money tends to humble people.

If I had a choice between some sales guy wandering around trying to sell an investment or someone telling jokes and doing tricks, I'd rather the sales guy stayed home and the trick guy made me a balloon animal. But thats me :)

It's one of the first few google results for bitcoin. It has the potential to be one of someone's first few impressions of bitcoin.
