How'd you edit it then? .bashrc uses ANSI for colors.

The limit is for withdrawal. There are no limits for buying/selling.

Oh wow! Very cool. Thanks! I didn't know about this. I just put myself in. Seems that most people use their OpenID to register and that makes it so people can't get in touch with them. Weak! :(
Edit: Awesome! I found someone who listed their phone. I just sent a text. I hope it's a cell

Toughest part of your scam is discovering the victim's security questions. Logging into banking websites from unfamiliar IP addresses will likely trigger them. 
@_date: 2011-10-19 02:29:22
Yeah. This kinda breaks my heart. &lt;/3
@_date: 2011-06-22 18:19:00
Yes, please! Please PM me!

Yeah, I post over there regularly. :)

Aw. I thought I had a taker. :(

First, let me preface by saying that I'm a strong advocate of BTC. I, myself mine and belong to MTRed (reddit's pool). I'm not a speculator and I'm not really interested in "getting rich" from BTC. I simply support the philosophy behind P2P-currency and I'm a geek that's in it for the longhaul.
That being said, if the US chose to criminalize BTC, I think that the market would still be affected and we'd still see a decrease in the value of BTC. Yes, BTC is anonymous, yes it's (for the most part) untraceable, but such a label would still move the market in a downward direction. Not forever, but it definitely would. 
Think of it as the inverse of what happened with the whole Silk Road media exposure affair. Silk Road and BTC got a shit ton of media exposure and the demand for BTC shot up, and the value of BTC shot up. What is the inverse? BTC is criminalized and sharp penalties for using the "evil drug currency" are enacted. I think it's very likely that demand will decrease and the value of BTC will as well. But not forever. Ain't no one gonna keep us down.

Did you share your login name with anyone? Or, are both your login name and password found in the dictionary? 
I feel for you, man. It's quite likely you got brute-forced. You really have to use a non-dictionary login/password in this day and age.

+1 on the interface, but there's no way to search for anything! And there's only 20 items for sale on the entire site? WTF?

Are you going to ask for SIN If not now, do you think ever?
@_date: 2011-07-28 17:02:13
Too bad. I bet you were a good lookin' dude, too. No homo.

Well, let's break it down. There's the inconvenience of meeting someone in person. But then there's the savings of not having to pay Mt Gox its trading fee. There's also the possibility that we might *gasp* even become friends. Haha. 
Looks like Mt Gox is trading at 13.9, right now. If we could do it sometime today, I'd be willing to round up to 14.

I transferred a couple hundred yesterday early evening. Now it's already past 5PM here and the funds haven't left my acount. &amp;
@_date: 2011-07-27 17:19:46
I usually buy MTGox. Is there a different rate on the street?

MITM is great if you can gain access to the same network. Not so much if your victim is located 3,000 miles away.
As for SSL, you should take a look at [sslstrip](

Are you in Chicago? There's a coffee shop practically on every corner and the transaction should only take minutes. Not only that, but Bitcoin will never become a real currency unless people are willing to actually trade offline, in person. Lastly, you don't know how much I want to trade.

Mind if I borrow one of those for six months, or so? &lt;3
@_date: 2011-08-02 07:02:06
Wow, you've got cohones. I hope you don't get too many chargebacks. Good luck. 
@_date: 2011-06-14 17:29:51
Don't you mean sell BTC in order to move USD out?  
@_date: 2011-06-14 09:43:01
Decrease. I suggest reading about supply vs demand.

Do your worst, hater. 
@_date: 2011-07-27 05:42:30
Well, there goes my idea of meeting in a dark alley. How about a public place like a coffee shop instead? :)
@_date: 2011-06-15 19:56:26
Yah, those are the color codes. Thanks dude. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 21:55:07
I think you're confusing the role of the Federal reserve bank with that of your local bank down the street. I think having BTC banks will only help to legitimize BTC as a real currency. Especially with insurance, investments and loans, etc. However, I think it's a huge mountain to climb right now with the volatility in the BTC market. Might be too soon. 
@_date: 2011-06-15 19:38:56
What's the ANSI color code for that green?
