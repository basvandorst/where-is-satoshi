Part of me really wants to see how Bitcoin does as a decentralized currency in our current climate.  
The other part of me wants to see completely anonymous currency that's completely untraceable and untaxable just to see what happens.  I'm interested to see what would happen if the oligarchy completely looses control of currency and can take almost no action to stop it.

In some cases I'm sure some people in fit that description.
However any group made entirely of arrogant jackasses who feel so superior to another group of people that they mock them all day in a subreddit specifically designed to do so definitely leans more toward NPD.  
I'm still trying to understand crime.  Being passionate about a new idea that hasn't been proven yet?....fucking horrifying I tell you.

I like the way the video is done.  None of the "This is our idea and how we see it potentially playing out".  Just "Here's a video of it working."
This is the key.  Companies and people are not going to just adopt Bitcoin becasue we say it's potentially cheaper and more secure.  The community of Bitcoin users and investors are going to have to create the products that MAKE bitcoin cheaper, easier, and more secure to manage.  If you build it, they will come.
I know there's this whole community of people who love to hate libertarian ideology, but this is that ideology right in play.  *Innovation in the marketplace that solves complex social and economic problems better than current solutions.*

I think the point is to MAKE more people look into it more and hopefully develop a culture of tipping where once it did not exist on the internet.  Reddit Gold is almost a precursor to this and it shows that people are willing to pay small amounts of money in exchange for seeing content they like.  So, clearly, there is a need for people who come up with creative content to get some sort of value in exchange for doing what they're passionate about.  Even if a few BTC get lost in the process, I still think it's worth it.


I agree that giving this stuff to your family who might be completely uninitiated, is not the best idea.  However, this is Reddit.  It's likely that a huge majority of people on this website have heard of Bitcoin and are far more tech savvy than your average Baby boomer mom and pop.

The entire Bitcoin community suffers from a language barrier between them and the outside world.  Even when someone attempts to ELI5, the explanations still tend to be loaded with insider jargon.
I don't know if this is a weakness or something that will alleviate itself once BTC becomes more money and the people who speak the language will be mostly behind closed doors.

The difference is that Uber, Facebook, Apple, and Netflix didn't need to make cute little motivational posters to get it's supporters to use their product.  
They simply made a product that was more efficient and offered better service a at a competitive price.
Bitcoin has a very, very long way to go and at the end of the day Bitcoin may not even be the crypto that offers the most efficient means of trade at the best price to consumers.
@_date: 2014-11-05 06:22:53
Yes, but there's gear that would need to be installed at the point of sale to accept payment by mobile phone, training for the staff to use it, and staff at headquarters to handle the whole ordeal.  These things cost money and BTC is way too new for them to invest in that kind of change yet.  Keep in mind that many financial analysts and academic economists are still very much undecided (and in some cases against) BTC.  It's going to take time before large companies are willing to take the risk.
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:26:50
I don't know about obsessed. He speaks on a range of issues concerning libertarianism and families. The family stuff is what gets controversial, but when he speaks on stuff like bitcoin it's generally spot on.
I understand wanting to read it though. I guess to make it short he covered two things.  One is just the basic way that BTC measures up with government fiat (from his perspective). The other outlines how smart governments will likely try to thwart BTC by not banning it, but slowly throwing regulatory sand into the gears of bitcoin operations to the point that normal people will never find it convenient enough to adopt.

I know that investors are a critical part of what's going to make BTC tick, but every time something comes up about investors, it needs to be reiterated that Bitcoin is worthless if it's not used as a means of exchange for products and services.
As long as we continue to focus on expanding the community and expanding the application of bitcoin "The currency", the investors WILL show up to the party.

 &gt;the association with bitcoin, which is reeling from a string of crises involving fraud probes and bankruptcies and has a reputation for facilitating payments on the so-called dark web – an online marketplace for anything from drugs and weapons to assassins for hire –means few executives inside large established financial institutions want to talk publically about it.
These are not legitimate arguments against Bitcoin.
This is the strawman shit they're going to keep pulling against BTC.  They're trying to play off BTC like it's not attached at the hip to the blockchain so they can introduce ideas that continue to give them control over the money supply while taking advantage of the cost savings the blockchain may provide.

I think the word 'cult' is completely dead when people are simply using it to attack others they disagree with.  The word is just meaningless now.
Some people in the community are quite enthusiastic, yes.  Some, probably to their detriment if they don't heed the advice of others by investing more than they can afford to lose on these very new ideas.
..but that still doesn't make your cult label viable.  
You're applying one derogatory label on an entire community based on the actions of a few vocal members because doing so serves whatever agenda you're trying to convince yourself is morally superior to anything the Bitcoin community says.  
So, now there's an entire subreddit dedicated to nothing but mocking people who are passionate about a new idea. Totally normal and healthy behavior /s.

Glad to hear him go down this line of reasoning.
It's extremely important for newcomers to understand that one of the main arguments used against BTC is the 'Store of Value' argument.  Jeffrey Robinson's recently book, for example, (which was basically a logical fallacy stuffed hit piece on Bitcoin) used the 'Store of Value' argument as part of his case against bitcoin.
A question of value underlies absolutely every human interaction…including trade.  I spend more time with my wife than my friends because I value my time with her more than I do my friends.  I purchase food because the value of that food is slightly higher (to me) than the dollars I’m willing to exchange for it.  These are simple examples, but simplicity is all it takes to understand how bitcoin relates to value.
US dollars have value too.  However, US dollars are not, by themselves, valuable to human beings in any utilitarian manner.  Certainly not as 1’s and 0’s on a computer screen, and as paper they are almost as useless.  We can’t eat them and we can’t throw them in a gas tank and expect our car to go.  This begs the question: Why are dollars valuable?  Well, see the above.  Dollars are valuable because human beings GIVE them value.  We decide, mutually, that dollars are worth food and gasoline.
However, A US dollar gains this value because its supply is more carefully controlled than many other currencies out there (see many third world nations) **and** it has the power of the government to threaten anyone with punishment who might try to counterfeit or undermine it’s value.  To put that another way...the US dollar is backed by the THREAT OF VIOLENCE.  This threat is what has ultimately given the dollar value in the eyes of humans.  "If you counterfeit this money, you get in trouble." thus, this money is safe to use as a "Store of Value".
Now…to be clear, in a utilitarian sense, Bitcoin is no more valuable than the US dollar.  So, anyone who tries to argue in favor of the dollar VS BTC in terms of utilitarian capability is committing a massive mistake in logic from the beginning.  However, what Bitcoin (and other digital, decentralized cryptocurrencies) can do is eliminate the need for a "Store of value" to require VIOLENCE as a means to ensure that the currency cannot be counterfeited AND it's supply is consistent and predictable to EVERYONE.  This is hugely important.  Not only because it eliminates the need for centralized authorities to regulate currency with the threat of violence, it also removes the ability of a very small group of people (Governments and central bankers) to have control over the currency from a central location and thus exercise a very abnormal amount of power over the entirety of monetary policy.

Seriously, this needs to become something.   
I spend an absurd amount of time on Reddit and I have made a few highly upvoted comments over the years.  Lately, I still read here a lot but I frequently opt out of spending my time making quality posts simply because there is no incentive to do so.  
I made a post about the depression that goes along with high student loan debt that resonated with enough people that made them click an arrow 2500+ times.  A few people even gave me Reddit Gold.  Where's the value in those things?  I don't really care about karma and I honestly don't care to have Reddit get the tips when I came up with that content....That's my depression I'm writing about you thieving alien.  If Reddit needs revenue, they can advertise.
If tipping for great posts and great content was in the culture, I could certainly see myself spending more time on posting quality content.  
This seems like the best mechanism I've seen to do just that.
Edit: upvote count

I watched an interview with Robinson recently about the book.  The biggest thing to understand here is that Jeffery Robinson isn't making arguments or debating against the educated and intelligent people of Bitcoin on their turf.  He's not even going there.  He's taking his arguments public and basically declaring himself the winner with no one having a chance to rebut his arguments in that sphere.
These are the tactics of a writer with a weak argument.
What seems to have happened is that Jeffery Robinson has attempted to write a book full of bias and incompletely represented talking points that a good deal of reasonably intelligent people can understand while also preying on those people's lack of knowledge of Bitcoin.  He did the same thing in his ABC interview as well.
The way he argues (which is noted in this review) is telling.  He presents any and all Bitcoin proponents as cultish loons while presenting the side he supports as rational and clear headed.  
**A rational, logical, and successful argument does not need to be presented in such a way that name calling is used as a way to drive your points home.**
Again, these are tactics of a writer with a weak argument writing for the sake of controversy and book sales.  Not someone who has a sound, rational argument.  What he's trying to do is build a consensus among the readers who trust him to simply label Bitcoin supporters as cultists and end the conversation without any analysis or debate.
Anyway, I really like this review but I think a review could be done that debunks this nonsense much more thoroughly.  Point by point if necessary. 
I'd love to take a crack at it, but I'm not going to pay money for the book.  
Anyone got a PDF or torrent link?

Large companies don't just change course because someone asks them too.  These companies have to spend millions on infrastructure to support bitcoin transactions so it's certainly not free.  
Bitcoin isn't even close to ready for most major retail applications. Mom and pop businesses (especially online) sure.  Some online retailers (Overstock.com for example) sure.  However, walking up to someone like Target or Walmart and asking them to accept a totally different currency requires enormous resources.
If bitcoin is going to grow, it's going to start very small and the infrastructure of businesses that support it are going to have to create a lot of solutions before major retailers are going to be willing to touch it.

Well, I understand Bitcoin fairly well as well as it's potential advantages in the marketplace (decentralization, un-counterfeitable, etc.) .  I understand the general idea, purpose, and utility of the blockchain however I do not understand the technology behind the blockchain at all.
Starting with Etherium, Sidechains, and now these truthcoins, I don't understand the lauguage being used at all.  "Prediction Markets" for example.... no idea what that means or how it's definition applies to the economic big picture.
To put it simply, I'm a layman who has an interest and I'd like to understand the end game potential of the technology because the techno-jargon is likely to always be above my head. 
Addition: I'll go out on a limb and say that it's likely that I'm not the only person who has this problem.  This 'language barrier' seems to be a consistent thing that keeps popping up.

Speculators have got their eye on it, which is why it has become so volatile recently.  
That trend probably won't stop but it is a sign that BTC has a chance...and investors see it.
If more businesses adopt it, then we've got something amazing.  That's the goal.  The only way that's going to happen is if Bitcoin enthusiasts convince business owners (especially those doing a little better than average) to adopt Bitcoin as one of the currencies they accept.  The businesses, preferably, need to be a bit better off because the owners first concern will be the volatile nature of BTC in it's fledgling stage in the global marketplace.
More than anything else, this community needs to get boots on the ground.  I'll be buying a business next year and BTC will be one of the mediums of exchange I accept.
However, that doesn't mean that 'saving' bitcoin is a bad thing.  It's a deflationary currency...it's expected that people will save it.
