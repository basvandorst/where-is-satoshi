Not a theme. This is the default interface for Robinhood Crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:36:23
You don’t need any of that. Works the exact same as setting up a brokerage account. 
Wait list is to be able to buy and sell crypto. You can open a Robinhood account right now though and buy and sell stocks for free with no commissions. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:01:15
I should also note, all transactions are free. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:06:08
Yep. You gotta wait in a queue to get access but that queue moves quick. When I first joined Robinhood I was put in a similar line but moved through within a week. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:40:34
US regulations. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:05:57
They move through the line quick. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:00:05
Really cool but dear god I hope no one thinks this is a secure way of doing anything. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:19:07
Both. I’d be willing be bet all my bitcoin that fewer than 20% of those hold crypto. 
Robinhood’s interface and zero cost transactions blow Coinbase out of the water. As someone with both, I’ll be consolidating entirely into Robinhood.

Ya. You gotta get an invite. It’s not fully rolled out. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:51:17
What keeps crashing?
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:44:50
As someone very skeptical about the future of crypto, this was a very interesting interview and opened my mind to some possibilities I hadn’t yet thought of. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:18:44
This chart is stupid as fuck. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:44:48
[Here]( 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:06:26
Wow! The chart shows how inflation works. So interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:37:15
Day. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:56:07
But it’s all the time... App is broken half the day in prod. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:19:19
Doubled my position. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 02:27:30
Government balance sheets should NEVER be run like a household. Your family, as one of many examples, doesn’t issue bonds. As a family, you should strive for a surplus. As a government, you never should. 
Government debt !== Credit card debt
Yes the government should reign in its outlandish spending but this oversimplification is pedestrian at best and it’s unfortunate this is even a part of the conversation. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 02:28:59
It’s literally never exploded once despite the constant alarm bells. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 07:08:37
Um it’s down 70% from its high last year. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 02:28:18
This guy gets it. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:10:36
What companies did you buy all those things through?
@_date: 2018-06-25 06:29:43
So what kinda stuff are you buying with it?
@_date: 2018-11-19 07:54:24
Probably not. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:07:45
You mean you are buying things with it as it was intended? 
Bitcoin was not meant to be treated as a speculative investment to hold people. It was meant to actually be used as a currency so that we can get off centralized bank money. 
Spend it!
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:47:40
Good! Looking forward to things getting much worse!
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:54:22
Why is he right?
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:44:37
What the fuck is moneyness?
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:53:50
But he doesn’t. It’s the same talking points recycled without an understanding of why the very things he claims are criminal are vital to stable markets. 
And before you say markets are unstable and collapse and cause problems, think about if our economy was based on Bitcoin and it’s performance over the last year. If that still sounds enticing, tickets to Venezuela are cheap, you just can’t buy em with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 04:44:05
For a logical guy, an illogical statement. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:01:43
Wow! So when can I use Bitcoin to pay for parking or pay my mortgage with it or my coffee with it?
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:06:09
Same for the vast majority. 
Bitcoin is on its way to its true value: $0. It was a great pyramid scheme while it lasted. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:09:34
Your point proves them right though: since the Bitcoin community is hellbent on not using it as real currency and instead a speculative investment, the HODL mindset is the opposite of a currency. 
And because it’s not a currency and it’s not a value producing asset, it’s worthless. 
It’s because of HODLers that made money and hold on to that ideology that will ultimately be the demise of Bitcoin itself. 
Sad to watch this unfold but unfolding it is. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:44:03
HODL is the antithesis of Bitcoin. The sin qua non of its very existence was to spend it! Like, you know, a decentralized currency! Not like a depreciating asset to tuck away and never use. The reason money is valuable is people can use it to attain goods and services. You can’t do shit with Bitcoin! (And don’t you bring out some “Look at this store that accepts it” bullshit.)
The reason Bitcoin is circling the toilet bowl is cause 1) it isn’t a currency and 2) people don’t use it cause 3) people just HODL it cause 4) people don’t understand how economies create value cause 5) they spend too much time on Reddit. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:35:30
Some long years to go before “Fuck it’s dead.” And even then people will still be on here like “HODL!”
