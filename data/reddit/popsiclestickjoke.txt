In my opinion that's a really healthy, big reason. Not sure what the BTC market is like for legal guns but this attitude is incredibly healthy and positive for the [hopefully] growing market.

I think there is evidence to show that the zero amount trade was actually not possible. :)

I'm no designer but have a bit of typography nerdism. I think there are a few inherit problems with the logo. 1) it doesn't scale well 2) aliasing problems at small scale 3) subjectively, I'm not sure what it pays homage too or why you'd add that weird thing to the B.

Even if you suspected that, you didn't *know* that. This is a flawed way of thinking of markets and going with your suspicions (short selling) isn't really great for the economy overall.
If you want to contribute to btc's success. Buy more during the lows and when it deflates buy goods with it. Help stimulate the economy.

I've been waiting for this limit to be removed for a while to make a rather large TV purchase.
But please for the love of all that is good, get rid of that awful accordion menu. Do you not see how that is a blatantly bad, difficult to use, poorly implemented UX? It jumps all over the god damn place when I'm trying to browse and just makes finding stuff on your store incredibly tedious.

No. Seriously, a google search and 5 minutes of research and you wouldn't ask this question.
edit: Actually, 1 minute and 56 seconds of your time to watch the video.

You realize that mathematics prove you are lying right?

Purchased a 55" LED TV from them last month. Excellent customer service. The best part is that it cost me about $300 USD since I made a sizable bitcoin investment around the time it was trading at $3. I had been waiting to liquidate a little bit of my BTC savings into tangible goods without converting back to USD. Glad to see bitcoin store and some other shops starting to pop up.
