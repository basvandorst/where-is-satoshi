I was expecting it to dip even lower but, meh. Can't be too greedy.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:51:35
Yeah, I put in a buy order  CAD this afternoon when there was a buy wall going on, oh well.
@_date: 2018-05-02 00:38:07
the resistance is strong, but it's futile.
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:22:49
BTC today.
@_date: 2018-05-04 23:17:54
10kneveragain my arse. To the moon!
@_date: 2018-05-25 09:04:50
PAMP IT!!!
@_date: 2018-05-25 09:01:47
First? I guess so...
@_date: 2018-05-02 23:00:50
that was a good support line @ 9k. Time to get back on track to amili.
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:51:04
Bitcoin is going to shoot up like  a civil rights hose. Damn!
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:09:27
Great response my good lad. Very much appreciate the feedback. ��
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:00:16
Walked away to make my tea when it was @ 8.8k and came back to a little above 9k. Seems too good to be true.
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:45:21
Thanks, I guess I’ve been away long enough.
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:36:09
I though that Mt. Gox bloke stopped dropping a huge dump on the market. Could some of you fine gents fill me in?
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:47:05
Holy smokes! the buying opportunity is strong tonight. Gotta take a step back and rationalise how much I'll buy.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:29:21
Oh my days! The green flashes on GDAX! Brilliant!!!
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:20:09
Well, I don't think it will go that low at all. The lowest I've seen ppl hoping for was 5k. But hey, I'm just some guy on the net, baud.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:16:26
And I thought selling yesterday afternoon was a bad idea. Phew! I only lost a little bit. Woke up to 10k CAD.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:02:40
A good amount at the bottom of that dip.
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:15:34
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:24:13
Yeah, if people are scared then they will maybe, just maybe be able to push the price down to ~7k. I always feel much happier when the price goes down, more buying opportunities. Time will tell.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:02:45
If it's another big dip, just do what Giancarlo's niece do. Hold On to Dear Life and buy more if you can.
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:07:08
A bulltrap?!?! I refuse to believe!!!
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:46:19
Please tell me this is not a pump and dump. It's been happening for the last 2 months and I'm tired of that shiet.
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:12:03
Looks like it might coming back down to test the bottom again. More buying opportunity I guess.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:06:13
Yeah, I agree. It's not regulated so any money bags can give the market the "Fuck my shit up fam" special. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:19:50
Yeah, I was and still am anticipating another bounce downward since that has been happening for a while. But we'll see.
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:05:30
It's inching closer to 10k CAD.  Looks like we're eatin' good boys.
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:53:02
The only problem I have with it is that when they're dumping, I'm always busy with work; so hopefully it will work out in my favour this time.
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:51:45
lel, 303 BTC sell wall  on gdax. Somebody use Jedi mind tricks to make it disappear.
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:16:14
Damn BTC!!! Back at it again with the 9k!
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:04:23
Another day, another drop. Time to get my buy orders ready.
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:59:06
Welp, it's going now. Press on lads.
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:27:45
BLAZE IT UP MY DOOZzzzz!!!!
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:06:16
Orders up!
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:17:58
Cor blimey, so the dip is really over. Good thing I bought a good amount a week ago.
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:23:56
I just realised it's 4/20 and BTC is high AF rn compare to a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:40:48
Bogdanoff, plz. Letz 9k be ze bottom.
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:31:56
The volume seems to be dropping off on gdax. Either we're bottoming out and prepare for another pump or shit is about to hit the fan. I'm rooting for door No.1 and prepare my wallet for No.2.
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:21:57
IST OVA NEIN THOUSAND!!! Schnell!!!
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:28:44
9k for the 6th time, lel.
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:56:46
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:13:49
I noticed that Bcash has been pumped hard lately. Is Ver really that desperate?
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:58:31
IT'S ALMOST NEIN THOUSAND!!!!
