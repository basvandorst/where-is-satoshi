It is not about if it is a fraud or a bubble, JP Morgan and their ilk could give a fuck, it is all about getting money. 
JP Morgan was apart of the housing bubble, happily going along, these people have no spine, they are worthless pieces of shit, dont listen to anything they say.

i fixed a computer that was owned by a brain surgeon. It was riddled with spyware and a bunch of worthless software starting, also, norton and mcafee where fighting over the computer and clearly not helping with the malware problem. 
A blanket statement 'most windows(i spelled it right) users are ignorant and naive'  is ignorant and naive.
personally, i love the job security. A good portion of the population doesnt have the time to learn about fixing computers, just like the majority of people dont learn how to fix there own car.

Those check marks are annoying, also, there is no way to know what your charging for BTC, your fee could be low, but if your charging high for the BTC it wont matter. 
also, how does anyone know this isnt a scam?
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:10:06
Its more like people who wnat to see a decentralized currency to take off for a whole host of reasons, if you do your research instead of name calling maybe you would understand. I wouldnt call them sheep, id call you sheep for trying so hard to shake it up...Alot of people who own bitcoins want a new better system. 
you clearly think everything is just fine with the system and follow the Shepperd cause its safe and you trust him.

Ill played some gambling games to see it. I didnt lose much a few dollars. I kept it low. Seems like they started realy realy well but then bam, you get screwed. I doubt the fairness of any of it, computers simply do what they are told. Also, there is no oversight to any of these, there is no way to verify. Maybe a open source that has been reviewed, then maybe id trust it.

Bitcoin is not a thing, making its usefulness alot different then say gas. There is really nothing to compare a bitcoin to, bitcoin serves markets that gas couldn't serve. 
100.00 of gas weighs alot, 100.00 of bitcoin weighs the same as a 1 million dollar bitcoin, and that is nothing. You cannot compare the two, there is no book or study on virtual currencys because it has never been done before...your best speculation is as good of a guess as anyone elses, however, your flawed in comparing it to a tangible object.

@_date: 2013-04-06 21:04:17
well there is nothing wrong with hoarding bitcoins, infact there is nothing wrong with doing whatever you want with bitcoins. 
When bitcoins disappear, it helps everyone by lowering the supply. So each one lost means the rest is worth more. If there was a bitcoin degredation, then i dont think it would be up to 140.00. Who would buy a bitcoin when you know the value is going to eventually go down? It cant work that way. 
Sure people lose there wallets and there will be ghost bit coins, but it would take a very very very long time for those little amounts to add up to anything other then raising the price of bitcoins. 
also, every commodity has a disappearance. Gold, silver, platinum...and well anything realy, all get buried, lost, shot into space, dumped into the sea. people get rich searching the sea. The gold standard survived for awhile, and gold has no real value, as a metal. bitcoins work in the same way. Sure there will be coins that will just disappear forever....as everything else.

Well, TOR is not fool proof from fools. I dont want to imagine SR going down, but clearly DPR did since he set up the fail safe. 
One scenario is DPR and the location of SR server(s) are compromised by someone or some flaw somewhere, then shut down by force.
and yes i know how tor works, i also know how people work
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:18:53
Your to impulsive, you don't know your buy and sell number so you just do it to have fun, it does leave a empty feeling because there was never anything there.
Let the buy and sell court you a little while, find the right one then settle, otherwise, your just going to hate yourself afterwords.

Its bought by other members, Mtgox doesnt buy your bitcoins, some other person does and they have the money on there account. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:54:40
1. Dont know, its weird.
2. There is systems already, litecoins for example, but others to.
3. Dont know, probably to stop inflation. Bitcoins can be divided up, you can have have .00001 or even smaller. Even at a billion dollars a bitcoin, it can still be broken up good enough so everyone can own some.
4. the value comes from what people are willing to pay, there is no Central authority to decide the value or to muck up the market, instead the mucking up is done by the people who are invested in it. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:55:38
I dont think SR has ever been hacked, and i dont know why people are comparing SR to a drug dealers house, thats just a lack of understanding of what SR is. Problem with SR is that its highly illegal and could get shut down at any time, they have a fail safe where you can put in a wallet address and if things go sour they send you the coins, never been tried though
DPR is probably more competent then any of the wallet creators out there. 
Yes you can transfer from SR to mtgox
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:59:07
Well go for it, its a interesting project to say the least. 
The worst that could happen? you could only buy a couple of hundred dollars worth of drugs, thats not all that bad right? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:37:25
you make a good point, but mtgox has the advantage of having multiple ways of funding it. Most exchanges are not easy to fund and are not very well thought out. They all sorta suck in there own special way.
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:08:43
not the lack of exchanges, its the ridiculous way to fund them. MTgox is easy to fund. Everyone else is a expensive wire transfer or some dumb bank payment that you got to wait a few days.
Honestly, its the stupidity of people thinking that anyone will pay anything to get money to them, lack of imagination that causes mtgox to hold the title. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 23:18:29
of course it would be a lose, that would be 1 billion more USD out there, thats inflation and we would all pay for it.
How would they buy all the bitcoins? people need to sell them, i wouldnt sell to the goverment.They might be able to buy alot of them, but all it would do is decrease the value of the dollar and increase the value of the bitcoins.

Journalist trying to talk about technical stuff is often hilarious.

I just wonder what makes you so emotionally invested in what other people do or do not believe
Do you think your so super smart that you know everything? Are you such  control freak that it just irritates you that the internet is full of people who disagree? Maybe your from the evil guverment looking to destroy something before it creates a horrible flood.
Point is, your opinion does not matter to the majority of people, stay within your inner circle for people who care about what you think.

So the forbes crowd stays away from bitcoin, maybe they can stay into real estate , where they clearly shine. 
I for one will not be sad over this...
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:45:51
i would try it if you get it to go to mtgox, my problem is i got to time my buys because otherwise i lose a lot of money because what i use the btc for uses average value...such huge swings makes it difficult. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:43:07
People will log into mtgox and decide what to do, This i am 100% certain. My crystal ball wont tell me any more then that, it said error...not enough bitcoins :(
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:01:56
well all of the above, i didnt sell my 2 btc because i believe in the system. Not to make money, or to buy drugs though its possible i wanted to do both.
I still believe in bitcoin, it can do things that no other currency can do..like buy drugs, not just that though. It removes banks and corrupt goverments from the equation, fuck the banks and all the corrupted politicians. Id rather lose my value to a system i like then support a corrupt system. 
FYI, you dont need to be a libertarian type to believe into crypto currencys.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:45:32
but not a peep before the housing crisis...how convenient huh?
I want to invest into bitcoins simply because the 'smart people' are saying not to. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:23:35
so it takes 4 days to get to mtgox? how long does it take to get to campbx? i got a account there, i was considering switching, but i am not a patient person. 
I already did the bank stuff with dwolla, i just need to know how long it takes to get to the exchanges
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:05:17
Geez i had to skip most that craziness.
What i was looking for is some type of evidence. Sadly, i didn't see any, only believe me or die. 
Just want to add that 95% of people wont believe you because your full of shit. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:29:07
i wasnt arguing what would happen, i was just simply correcting your logic.
You should of asked if there would be enough buyers to sell bitcoins. Thats a impossible question to answer, however, bitcoins do provide a roll that no other physical currency can offer, its hard to imagine there is no buyers..however if there is, then it would be the death of bitcoins and you would be a proud owner of a legacy worth nothing.
Of course, maybe years down the road you could be a owner of a wallet of something that doesnt exist anymore, that might have value in of itself..this is just speculation of course, i have yet to confirm this with my crystal ball.

There is one physical location for DPR and staff, there is obviously ways to contact SR and control it. A virtual location is just the same as a physical location as long as you can till the server(s) to go off.
Alot of assumptions in this thread, that includes SR never getting compromised.

i dont think 'i deposited this money into this guys account and he never gave me anything' sounds like much of a crime, but meh...what do i know? all you would need to do is say you did give bitcoins and well realy, how much do cops know about bitcoins? Just saying, im paranoid to
Getting it into mtgox would be awesome, i might take a chance if i could execute a timed trade. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 09:32:40
i sent 20, but ill give up my spot for 10 btc cause i suddenly need the money really really bad. So if you want a almost guaranteed spot, send me 10 btc...just tip me and ill send them a e-mail relinquishing my spot. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:18:21
As it stands, currently there is no big corporation truly funding it..its likley that if the banks start seeing as a threat, it wont be referred to as 'government keep my hands off my money'. More like, 'Socialism wants to make a coin that everyone shares in' 
SO you see, once big money starts get involved, then you will see the 'tea party' respond, as directed.

Well you need a attitude adjustment for sure.
your blanket annoyance of anything windows is noted, however, since 90% of all computers have windows on them, crying and screaming as such doesnt solve any problem.
I hate macs because apple is a shitty stupid company, now i could apply my stereotype to you and say that you, like all mac users, are simply tools to a company that preys on vanity and arrogance; But, like your broad stroke of the pen, id be wrong as well. 
If macs where so great then why do they barley live on? why did they lose so much ground to windows? o ya, thats right, because apple have a bunch of dumb asses running it. Even after all this time, even after getting destroyed in the PC market, they still pull the same stupid shit and hide it under pretty colors. 
My suggestion is, go with linux as a windows alternative, dont support such a disgraceful company.

No clue, got in for a minute then its some error or another. First i thought it was me, because i to couldnt find anything...then again, i just found something, so clearly not just me. 
maybe this why the price of btc is crashing?
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:32:33
kinda expensive but its the fastest
ATM-&gt;bitinstant (walmart) &gt;wallet
I got a 10 minute drive home, and my btc are deposited before i get home. 
On the other hand, bitinstant is getting a bad rep, i have never had a problem though. 
If you link a bank account to any site, then you will have a few days because banks dont want to give up money. I dont know of any site that links the way coinbase does, but you could open a dwola account and deposit from your bank from there, then i believe there is a few options, mtgox for one.

While im not going to sit here and make a full report on how tor hidden services work, here is one quote
"nobody can relate sending the introduce message to the client's IP address, so the client remains anonymous. "
Basically each hop is encrypted so the computer only knows where to send it to, not where its from.
another quote
"The rendezvous point simply relays (end-to-end encrypted) messages from client to service and vice versa. "
basically the whole thing is encrypted 6 times to and from. 
Also, from your statment im just going to assume you have little experience in IT, encryption or networking...infact, its doubtful you even understand what the NSA can do, you just have it in your head that they can read and see everything. Of course thats what they want you think so keep thinking that and follow all the rules. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:43:18
Same reason why we value gold. Its not all that rare, at least not as rare as bitcoins will be once they are all mined. Gold is everywhere, open up your computer and you will find a little bit of gold, but otherwise its just a worthless metal. Back in the day, gold was worthless execpt the worth we put on it.
Bitcoin is alot different then gold, bitcoin can cross country boundary's and remain relatively anonymous, it can hide itself, and can be used in the black market rather easy. This gives bitcoin special niche that gold, diamonds, oil, and tulips dont get. Its also not a thing, giving it its own unique advantages and disadvantages.
Litecoins is the same concept really, the problem with litecoins is why do you need a litecoin? its not adopted the way bitcoin is becoming, and it provides the same thing, why do you need another system? It may take a form, but probaly not adopted the way bitcoin will be.
I think the key to the rise is what can be done with bitcoins and the compared price to your dollar. If merchants can accept it, and still provide discounts making it cheaper to sell goods in bitcoins, it will skyrocket. If it remains roughly the same then its probaly going to even out, but if people find it more annoying then using credit, its going to drop back down and remain relatively low. 
In the realm of possibilitys is, bitcoin remains going up, its always getting used, always getting sold and circulated. If this is the pattern, if the need for a bitcoin is faster then the pace they are made, then the price will simply continue to rise. As long as the need is more then the supply, there is no reason for it to go down. Since bitcoins can be broken down, they dont lose there value. If you buy 120.00 in bitcoins then you get roughly the same to spend, mean the price to adoption wont matter. It could be a million per bitcoin, people could still afford to use it. Speculators will just continue to speculate. 
I think the banking system primes bitcoins to take off, how many people can honestly say they like banks nowadays? 
Bitcoin however will not die out because of the black market. Infact, im betting alot of people want to wish it doesnt get so popular as to attract attention. There are alot of messed up bad things that can be done with bitcoins, not just drugs, but we are talking major funding operations for terrorist, communist or whatever the next boogy man will be. Its anonymous nature maybe its death, or at least a severe crack down. 
Though its nature would make it difficult to destroy completely.
