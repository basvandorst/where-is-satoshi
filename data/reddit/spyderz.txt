All these stupid regulations really helped prevent the recession of 2008. Regulating open markets is corruption at it's highest form. Milton Friedman said that and won a Nobel Prize.

Who cares, China is only 8% of BTC, they can of EFF right off. This is completely fabricated news to get some action in the markets. Not falling for this anymore, go kill yourself OP.

Considering the security of mobile phones, keeping bitcoins on it is probably the last thing you want to do.

I smell chicken dinner coming soon! This will probably be the last entry window for poor people to buy full coins. Those that are smart, will be buying like mad.

Both iPhone and Android equally suck. Both yank apps down that threaten their ecosystem, both provide back doors to the NSA for spying. Android is a freaking complicated mess compared to iOS for updates and operation. Ultimately we need the Ubuntu or the new "Black Phone." But that'll be aways off. I'm sure this will all get fixed up shortly, but rage, revolt, throw your old iOS devices at the glass windows of Apple stores.

I have circle, it's amazing. But I found the buy price with credit card substantially higher than Coinbase. I haven't tried an online bank transfer yet.

What liberal ass petition is this? "Dark Market" sounds so much more interesting than "Free Market." Are words scaring you? Do you need mommy to tuck you into bed at night? Does she print out your bitcoins and store them in her purse for you? Seriously!

Seriously, one day BTC-e is going to get hacked hard and Bitcoin will be over. Why can't these companies get their security right?

Time to get a Tangerine account, I think they cover some of those ATM fees.

I'll call Marc Andreessen and tell him to tell CoinBase.com to reach out and get that setup. Will take a few days.

How hard is it for someone in China to buy Bitcoin? I thought the banking crack down made it impossible.

FX should add BTC to their exchanges and let the market really price it at what it should be. I'm guessing it would be quite a lot less than what it is right now.

Bought my first coins at $537 No way I was playing this game at the $1000 range. China is not Bitcoin, they'll work around this obstruction.

China is not Bitcoin. This obstacle to the Chinese, is just that, an obstacle. They'll just go around Chinese controls and establish accounts in other countries. However, the market loves a great story line to crash a market and profit on it. This is a pretty good one at that! I got in at $537 and I'm holding long on this one.
