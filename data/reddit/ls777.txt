It's a field that appears in trading and markets though, which is not a pure quantitive field but involves understanding investor sentiments

for money, of course. Running an exchange is lucrative, there is a fantastic business opportunity right now for a developer to take over where the current one is failing and potentially make a ton of cash. There are a ton of people who are interested in making this currency happen, a better wallet should be around the corner. I bet a group of programmers could easily get funded as a bitstarter, or even by one of the major bitcoin holders. to make a new wallet. 


I'm going to have to disagree with you there. The analogy isn't perfect, but it's there. Bitcoin is pretty amazing all by itself, doesn't need to be replaced.

Yes, but only if it keeps on getting more popular. Todays crash may cripple it for a long time.

Its the open source cryptographic nature that results in the trust. Better than google.

OKAY. lets do this. I've got 0.5 BTC right here and a crazed look in the eye, TIME TO CRASH THE MARKET

It has an intrinsic value as a decentralized currency. Open source, cant counterfeit it , instant transactions anywhere in the world.
Gold and silver have great value, but not as a currency.

4chan is terrible too, just for different reasons

Lag time has to do with the exchanges, not bitcoin at the moment. 
It's precisely the problems with modern banks and the abuses of centralized currency that has led to bitcoin. If you have utmost faith in banks and don't care or have a use for the advantage of bitcoin, then bitcoin isn't for you. Right now bitcoin isn't accessible to the average user since there isn't any well-made software for it. Remember, bitcoin is still in its infancy. It's like saying internet will never be anything because it's slow, ackward to use, and hard to understand (early internet days)

and how exactly would you distribute that new currency?

It's anyones guess as to where the price could go right now. It could shoot back up, drop to zero, or stay the same. Invest only if you are okay with losing all of it. I personally think it will maintain around 150 and slowly increase.

Is that really your address? How does it feel to be to be probably set for life?
