Deal with that problem. Perhaps make prosecutors serve an identical sentence to the innocent if the person is knowingly wrongfully convicted.

I agree 100%
@_date: 2018-08-01 00:20:48
Me too. I'm talking about the worst of the worst where there is zero doubt about guilt. People caught in the act type of evidence.

"REEEEEEEEEE!"  
Edit: The TDS is strong, eh?

You catch someone in the act of murdering a child, then they need gone. I understand about other evidence. However, there are many that leave zero doubt.  Manson, for example. Total waste of money.

Please take their advice. You're very talented and could make some money at this. Don't be taken advantage of either.

What if I told you, tomorrow's price will be between $5,000 and $8,000?
It's just going to most likely do the slow creep downward for 2018.

Pity mine fell off my boat. I was drunk. Don't remember what lake.

Read "The Creature From Jekyll Island". It'll be educational for you on this subject. The history of the Federal Reserve is criminal. Most people think it's a government entity. It's not.

And the IRS is no doubt still removing money from my check.

How has the dollar performed against gold over the past year? How has bitcoin? Asking for science. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:35:54
It's almost as good for bitcoin as investing in the Venezuelan Bolivar. Investors will stay away. Price will drop and drop.
