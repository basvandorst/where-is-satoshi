None of those rose and fell as significantly as auroracoin.  Auroracoin had some reall high (or ven niave) hopes but all people wanted was to pump and dump it.

One way is to get people to not cash out.  If you accept bitcoin as a vendor, don't instantly convert it back to USD.
But vendors want less risk (avoid volatile prices) and cash out quickly.  Its a self fueling reaction.

I'd like to add, the buy/sell spread of bitcoin on exchanges is in essence acting as a transaction fee that is suffered by both parties.  Its actually amounts to a few %.  One of the advantages of dealing in purely bitcoin is the lack of sizable fees.  But due to risk concerns people are consistently buying/selling their coins which is costing the users.

At least you didn't invest into Auroracoin.

Despite you being downvoted, I agree.  If I were to buy bitcoin I'm pretty much forced to pay a 15% premium over the market price.  Then whatever i use this bitcoin to buy is now 15% more expensive than using cash.  In the meantime I risk getting scammed by the bitcoin vendors.  I'm in Canada so most sources of bitcoin are not available to me.
There is no practical advantage to using bitcoin for someone like me.  I don't consider being part of a movement to be an advantage.

This quote is irrelevant because its only talking about things with intrinsic value such as ownership of a company which can be valued..  Its context is regards to buying good companies when the price is low and it is not a suggestion to catch falling knives.

For the economy as a whole, its investment.
