"He who enrols, controls". 
Isn't this exactly what Onename is doing by dictating the protocol that controls the data.

same, also take a look at openid.

So how do we know your protocol wont evolve based on the interest of you shareholders?
You have the right to grow your business, but your interest may not always be aligned with the vision of this community.

So you want to replace Namecoin with Blockstore, an untested protocol developed by a business? How smart is that.
The only reason Onename is (sometimes) pushing Blockstore is because they are failing to get support on their obvious attempt to hijack the ID/ namespace, replacing it with a protocol they can dictate at their convenience.
Onename is unlikely to post on their clear attempt to hijack Bitcoins  ID system, has made the community unlikely to support any of their projects.

Onename dictating the rules for a protocol that oversees the ID data going into a non standard Namespace (U/) is a terrible idea.  
If they get enough support over a business independent take like OpenID, Onename ( a private business) may end up controlling a crucial part of the crypto ecosystem.

Why is Onename refering to "Blockchain ID" what was Passcards a week ago, and OpenName two weeks ago? WTF!
Ok so I build on Passcards (or the new name next week), but then they are now discussing blockstore. Is like they dont even know what they are trying to create, so how are we suppose to build on top of this?
Im obviously looking to build on top of an ID system, while I dont care if is Namecoin or something else. I feel like what Onename is doing is a joke! They control it and will change it every day to their convenience.
So I will much rather build on top of something solid like namecoin /id , or idchains. A simple, yet stable solution. In order for my project to suced it needs a solid ground, that Onename keeps shaking
