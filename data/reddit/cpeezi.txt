Tesla and electronic logs are (sort-of) killing my current job, so I'll gladly look for alternatives. Haha

I don't have any charity in particular that I would recommend (aside from seconding "Wikipedia", which someone has already commented) but I just came here to say that this is awesome. I'm happy that the power of the internet has contributed to this philanthropy and will help change people's lives.

It's likely a traffic issue. Coinbase also crashed several hours ago this morning (US) when Bitcoin hit 11k.

I'm assuming they got a MASSIVE influx of users trying to buy/sell when the price of everything tanked.
I opened Coinbase when BTC was at 8700, it hasn't worked for the last 20 minutes, and now BTC is already nearly back up to 10k.
Totally related: I decided today that I'll be switching exchanges.

I've honestly got no idea. The more I look around, the more it seems the major exchanges are all crashing for various users today. Maybe none of them had the ability to scale their servers to handle such an influx of buyers/sellers all at once.

As someone who is both an avid gamer and is invested in cryptocurrency, this shit pisses me off. I haven't been able to get a hold of a damn graphics card for a reasonable rate for months. The last one I got was off of a hardware exchange subreddit because some nice lad figured he'd let his old GTX 970 go for a reasonable cost, but that's been quite some time, and I haven't seen anything even remotely close to that in price since. It sucks.
