Congrats! If my coin is ever worth enough for me to become debt free (I'm just out of college) I'll sell it too!

I think the 300 at 17k is totally killing our momentum. I took my $ out till we pass it bc i'm afraid ppl will see the momentum has stopped and then they'll sell too. We've already taken a shot at it twice and slipped &amp; fell each time. It's gonna take something extraordinary to burst through that sell wall. 
edit: here we go... maybe third time's the charm

I made an order yesterday. Today my order was cancelled because "the price increased." I've noticed that the $100 price switches between the silver iphone and the space grey one, so I think maybe purse.io is pricing it this way to attract people to make new accounts (like I did) but is switching the price back and forth between 2 different color phones so that none of the orders actually go through. I thought it was fishy that the price was up for so long if it had been a mistake. Surely purse.io would have corrected it by now, but no. 
It's too bad because I was dreaming about a new iphone x for $100 and buying one for everyone in my family for christmas. Or buying a ton and selling them for $1000 to make $900 profit on each.

I got the same amount back in coin, not in dollars. The coin rose in value $10 while it was with purse.io, so I actually got back $10 more than I put in. I ain't complainin'.

Holy shit, I should go make another order.
