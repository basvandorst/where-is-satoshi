Stellar XLM?  How can a coin stay in Top 10 with an obviously inflated circulating supply this long?  Its more than double what it should be.  While other coins that should have a higher one, are kept low on purpose.  More parts coming soon.  This is long from over.

If you don't read the evidence, the don't shout FUD.  Data is very clearly being shown incorrectly:

Thanks for your review.  Looked at the article closer, saw where bias can come off in the bolded statements and removed them.  Language to emphasise? That's staying as is.

Some opinions cannot be factual.  To us they may be, to you not.  Factual data is stuff that can be verified.

Stellar, Binance, Cardano, NEO, VEN, MKR all have known public issues that CMC has not addressed.  Binance went so far as to create their own site with the correct data.  Stellar should be 8 billion XLM circulating, not 18 billion, MKR said CMC refused to update theirs for 6 months.  VEN was half the circulating supply 2 months ago.  We could go on. Read the post in detail.  This is just the obviously wrong data we're showing here.  What about all those coins languishing in the ? as circulating supply or sub-500 territory that should actually be much higher?  How many coins are publicly commenting about these issues and not being heard by the "mainstream" community? We've scoured the internet and compiled it all for you in one place.  More posts to come.

How about an 18 billion circulating supply instead of the factual 8 billion?  How about a coin in the top 10, that should not be there?  How about coins that should be in the top 50 but are not there by deliberate actions of CMC?  This is not about non-live data.  It's about direct manipulation and fraud.

We had a few articles out about it before, but currently removed, including all social media accounts.  
We're watching what happens from here for a while.  This rebrand and community outreach effort is something fresh.  
We're as surprised as most other people are at this turn around.  Let's see if it leads to any meaningful changes at CMC.
If things go sour, we will be back.

You cherry pick the numbers that are interesting to you but leave out all the other blatant issues?  We are analysing every coin and point out all issues, not just major ones.  If you stopped reading after Number 2 because of that, then you must not read many pieces of writing.
Circulating Supply is not an approximation if pulled from EtherScan.  They would be exact if that is the case.
CMC is not pulling their data from EtherScan.  Our analysis shows discrepancy between there and what CMC has shown.  They disregard that data and come with their own figures.  We can show you tons of coins where this problem exist.  The teams go "LOOK AT ETHERSCAN YOU HAVE THE WRONG DATA" and CMC doesn't change it.
We provide hundreds of data points which shows fraudulent and erroneous information.  Binance went so far as to create their own CMC (info.binance.com) with the correct supply data, because CMC would not update.
Your comments stink of paid shill.  So do your historical posts.  Are you Gliss?

Censored and hidden.  Probably for the best for now.
