comments on videos, Facebook, browsed here for about an hour… I've known about bitcoin for years, but only recently has it started to get a really pushy/arrogant community.  (outsiders opinion, no need to hate)

OMFG WOOOOOWWWWW :/

just see a lot of people banging on about how 'people should buy into bitcoin before its too late' thats propaganda… bticoin should be treated a lot more like a speculative stock. thats all I'm saying...

sorry but, What a waste of power…
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:25:31


I'm talking like a utopian society. I'm a dreamer…


...and yet a realist - we are no where near there yet…


I guess, yeah

the more uneven the wealth distribution becomes, the more unappealing it is to become involved.

thanks, as i said, comp sci guy here! lol not to mention theres a help button like right there!
i guess to me, we already have a corrupt unfair system in place… if we are going to change it, it should be well organised, globally adopted, and fair. we don't have that ability at the moment because we are too primitive… one day, hopefully, humanity gets its shit together and once we can all get along crypto coin technology can be invaluable (as it can for other applications even today)… for now though, bitcoin is a project, an experiment ahead of its time.

fair enough, you're right its a baseless claim but its my perception of what i see. further to this, I'm not saying crypto currency won't take off, just that I don't think it will be / should be bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-03-04 09:17:52


but thats just replacing an unfair broken system with one equally as broken. whats the point?

Is he smart enough/is it possible, he had a sleep timer set somewhere that unless postponed by a set time, triggers a script that does this? like a doomsday failsafe mechanism to obfuscate and try to preserve his holding? he had the resources for a few years to build conceivably anything…
