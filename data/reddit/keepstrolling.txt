ETFs hold an amount of the underlying asset (in this case btc) equal to the total number of shares times the share price.  Put another way, the market cap of the ETF should equal the market cap of the underlying btc.  However, the price of the ETF can differ from the underlying assets. When this happens, market makers step in to arbitrage the difference.  This happens in two ways:
* 1. If the price of the shares is too high, they can buy btc in the open market, and exchange them for new shares of the etf
* 2. If the prices of the shares is too low, they can exchange a number of shares for the underlying btc
This differs from GBTC, where 1 share equals a fixed number of btc, and investors can pay more (or less) for a share than the equivalent of btc.  This has created the premium we see in BTC today.

im not really sure how ACR plans to do this.  Normally when you deposit with them, you must give name, address, etc.  Id assume this would be the same with or without bitcoin.

As an American, professional poker player, I'm extremely excited to see this.  I already play ACR regularly.  They have good traffic across a good range of stakes ($10-$1000 cash games).  Theyre support is very good, and they have some excellent withdrawal options that will get you your money in short order. I already recommended ACR to my friends who wanted to play some online poker, and this just makes it even easier. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions about the site or how to set up an account.

Assuming none of those risks exist is lol. You're certainly taking on risk holding btc for 2 days

Problem with their payment processor, not them.  I play a lot of poker there and have been paid every time. Just work with support and youll get your money, don't sweat it.

I think good advice is that if you want to transact with bitcoin (which almost no one on this sub is doing) you should plan to do so as quickly as possible. The price of bitcoin is volatile, so act quickly. Minimize holding time.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:14:23
If you know the price of what you sold and you know the amount of bitcoin you received cant you back into the fiat price?

$79 per month is also waaaayyyyy more than you will pay in the government options. In this example that’s ~25% fees. That is massively significant.
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:43:57
Read through the fees, pretty fine with them.  It seems like other than the $10 fee to order it, if you only use it in the US on purchases you won't incur fees?  That's not bad.
I'm curious though, how does bitpays price line up with other exchanges? What kind of built in spread am j paying every time i convert? That's not in the fine print (that I saw at least)
Edit: I have another question. Suppose I buy bitcoins, they appreciate, then I sell them- I trigger a tax event. Say I buy bitcoins, they appreciate, then I fund my debit card and spend them. Taxes? I have to assume yes since this Murca, but would like to check
