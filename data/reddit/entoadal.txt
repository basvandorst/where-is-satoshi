Thanks for posting the video.   I took my CHL training there a couple of years ago, and Cargill was my instructor.

Chinese New Year is 31 January.   My guess is that many "red envelope"  gifts this year will contain bitcoin.   
It should interesting to see if the buys ramp between now and 31 January, and then drop off.

I just used the Tembusu ATM at The Spiffy Dapper.  It's really that easy.
BTW, the Spiffy Dapper is a great hole in the wall bar - definitely recommended.

I'm currently travelling to Singapore on business and I saw this post earlier this morning.   The Numoni ATM on Orchard Road is 10 minute walk from my hotel, so I walked down there and used it.
The Numoni ATM accepts 2, 5, or 10 Singapore dollars only at a time to buy.  That converts to about 1.57, 3.94, or 7.88 US dollars.   That's pretty low, but I guess it's a start.
The ATM's scanner recognized the QR code displayed on my mobile phone right away. 
You must provide your mobile number to the ATM so it can text you when the transaction is complete.  It only accepts mobile numbers with the Singapore country code (65) and I'm visiting from the US, so the shop owner allowed me to input his mobile number instead.  Within a few minutes, he received the SMS with the confirmation, and the bitcoin showed up in my wallet.
Overall, it's easy to use, but I wish I could buy more at a time.  The shop owner was very helpful and says he got the ATM a couple of days ago, and he's the only other person besides me to use it so far.  
The ATM is in a good location, within a shopping center with a couple dozen international remittance shops - each of which was jam packed with people today sending money home.
