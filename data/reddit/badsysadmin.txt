Whilst this strategy is reasonable, your sums are wrong - the difference between hodling the lot until $40k, and selling 10% at each doubling is $1m
In the former case you finish with $3.6m in BTC and $0.4m in cash, for $4m total. In the latter case you have $5m in BTC.

For a 50% probability to imply a $600 if approval does not happen, would imply a price of $1800 if it is approved
`Probability.unapproved * price.unapproved + Probability.approved * price.approved = current price`
`0.5 * $600 + 0.5 * price.approved = $1200`
`price.approved = $1800`
It's also possible that the probability of approval is 50%, but the prices for both scenarios are closer

They have a hardcoded minimum of 1sat/byte, so it would cost you 0.08 BCH per block. Given they're doing 500 blocks a day (across the 10-block days and the 1000-block days) it would cost about $12k a day.

The amount their asking for on indiegogo is both far too much for their stated projects, all of which are fairly simple and have been handled by volunteers with Bitcoin and other branches; and nowhere near enough to make it a better medium of exchange than Bitcoin, the only way it'll get anywhere.
And even their stated aim won't be achieved the way they've set it up. Since they're using merged mining, and handing the inflation tax to miners, wealth will just be concentrated with those with the capital to buy hashing power. It's like a fiat currency, except instead of the government benefiting from seigniorage and spreading the money around to some extent, it all goes straight to those with capital - the exact opposite of the project creators want.

Pearoast from the other thread:
As compared with Bitcoin on the [classical standards of what makes money]( Freicoin is not better on any, and is *by design worse* as a store of value. Consequently, no one will use it.
The amount their asking for on indiegogo is both far too much for their stated projects, all of which are fairly simple and have been handled by volunteers with Bitcoin and other branches; and nowhere near enough to make it a better medium of exchange than Bitcoin, the only way it'll get anywhere.
And even their stated aim won't be achieved the way they've set it up. Since they're using merged mining, and handing the inflation tax to miners, wealth will just be concentrated with those with the capital to buy hashing power. It's like a fiat currency, except instead of the government benefiting from seigniorage and spreading the money around to some extent, it all goes straight to those with capital - the exact opposite of the project creators want.
TL:DR it's a total joke.

You're assuming that the adoption of Bitcoin is zero-sum - this is partialy false, as Bitcoin clearly creates utility by allowing transactions that would otherwise be banned (and represent deadweight losses)
However, there probably is also a wealth-transfer aspect, but this will specifically be from holders of fiat, probably also gold and silver, and to fiat-denominated debt (sovereign and possibly corporate) 
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:51:13
Well, that assumes that ratio is maintained, which I doubt it would be. There's ~17,000 unopened 1BTC coins. If Bitcoin went to say $1m, it's hard to imagine there's enough super rich coin collectors to sustain what would then be a $4m price.

If you managed to track these down, you'd have to be fairly arrogant to then think that *you* could safely launder them without getting caught - unlike the people you just caught. The risk if you're wrong isn't just the extra money after all, it's potential imprisonment. Large sums of money (relative to your wealth) don't have linear utility either - few people would coin-flip for a say $100k even if the payoff was $250k.
