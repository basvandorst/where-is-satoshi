How do I get a bitcoin address to associate with the email address?
@_date: 2014-10-09 11:29:50
Thanks for your reply. I guess I was asking how can I get a bitcoin address? I am subscribed to the thread and try to keep up with the technology, but frankly have never bought any equipment to mine coins. I figured this might be a way to allow my phone to be used as a rely and potentially earn a few coins in the process. So what's the best way to get the address?

Actually yes you can as some towns accept gold.

I agree a lot with your post when comparing bitcoin to gold, but have two concerns.
1) While yes you can go mine gold yourself, (well anyone can with the proper tools), the current system limits to either companies or people with the proper paperwork from some form of authority.
2) Gold can be subdivided in the sense that if I own 1 gold bar, I could break it down. However, since gold is an element that is composed of atoms, there is a limited amount on Earth.

BTC does seem to fluctuate frequently, but to me the constant comparison to the US dollar makes the currency seem less meaningful. In the United States, regardless of policy and inflation, most people know the cost of a product from a laptop up to a luxury car is relative the same from month to month and year to year. And even with some places starting to accept BTC more, it is still hard to peg buying a car at a constant 20 to 40 BTC.

That is one of the problems I think that most people have with the system. For a system to come along and claim it is a new currency. Free from government and the banks, so many people have that mindset of trying to find a way to take their "investment" of today and make it grow, so that it has greater spending power.

This wonderful summary is why so many people believe Bitcoin is a commodity and not a real currency. People are always "buying in" and "selling it off".
