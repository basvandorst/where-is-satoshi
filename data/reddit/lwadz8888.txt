Just so you get a feeling for it. Its going to be printed on a cotton based paper very similar in feel to a USPS money order of even cash. I would prefer a more traditional looking design (like security paper or currency) than a kind of goofy looking bubbly one. Something that can be taken seriously. Think bond, stock certificate, money order ect. Thanks!

Eh, it's one of those things. Use them or not. LoL. Either way they'll be available on amazon soon enough.

I could sell the template and then people can put there own addresses on them.

Yea thats pretty much the idea. Its just c bill vs. a coin. And they will come unloaded.

Hey man. If coinbase wanted to they could jack all your coins and kill bitcoin forever. The point is reputation is what allows people to trust these.

I would agree with you if it weren't for the pending transaction times. BTC was never designed for the popularity it gained. That's why it's kind of doomed unless it can be corrected some how. Thats why I mostly look into LTC and Ether. They are both designed more for day to day. Bitcoin will become like the gold standard. Buy and hold type while others will be day to day.

So trust is solely reputation. People will throw a small amount on there. Realize it wasn't stolen and then over time it will be trusted. Customer is anyone who would require a paper btc transaction. As BTC transaction fees sky rocket and confirmations become unreasonable a method of quickly transacting small amounts is needed or else other coins will prevail in time and BTC will become gold vs actual day to day currency. I'm not trying to make a killing on them. Just something I'm going to be offering. The value of the check can be verified easily enough to make certain its good.
