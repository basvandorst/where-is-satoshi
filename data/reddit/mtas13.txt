You have to appreciate the irony of the situation though. As ETH holders, We've been told "bail out shitcoin!" for two months by the BTC crowd and we end up bailing out BTC holders....

can someone please explain me what are the possible flaws of bitcoin unlimited? I find the solution extremely elegant but I might be missing some key weaknesses.

I don't want to be disrespectful but those are just fancy words to me. I really would like understand if LN is the just the bitcoin version of bar tab, gift card, Venmo....
The way my money flow works is:
-I am paid by my employer at the beginning of the month
- I spend my money on a day to day basis into restaurants groceries etc...
Can this type of flows be handled off-chain by LN?

Forget about it that's just throwing money out of the window. I lost 1btc to learn this lesson

So the argumentation goes as follows:
- There is only one public ledger that worth anything: the one that I mine. That is, the one for which I decide which transactions should or should not be included.
- It's fantastic so you should all use it, but the catch is that it can only record  3tx/s. You might think that it makes sense to use other ledgers but no, not at all, instead you should  bribe me more and more in order for me to accept your transactions.
Makes sense, I don't see any flaw.

funny, I thought failure looked like a closed door meeting between a handful of VC funded developers and miners from a single very mildly democratic country to decide what the future of bitcoin should be

Affordable fiber internet connections. 
Both do not exist right now, both are likely to exist in a not so distant future. However apparently it make sense to count on sidechains but it's completely stupid to count on affordable fiber internet connections.

Thank you very much for the explication, I sincerely appreciate it. But unfortunately this is what I feared, this is exactly what Venmo does. You can pay anyone using the "venmo payment channel" as long as you priorly committed the fund into it. I am really not impressed by the solution :/. I don't know what to think anymore, I hope weak blocks end up being a good scaling solution.

It's contradictory to say on one side there is only one blockchain just like there is only one internet and on the other side the blockchain can only record 3tx/s and this cannot change for now. Then What happen if every second 4 people in the world want to use a public blockchain? Shall they give up on this foolish ambition because Valery Valivov decree that there is only one true blockchain?
Being a bitcoin maximalist and being a smallblockist are two perfectly valid opinion, but as of today those two opinions are not compatible and that's what the  growing altcoin marketcaps are telling.
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:51:18
You're absolutely right but this does not helps the scalability. This just prevent the counterparty risk of Venmo not having my funds, but to be honest that's not something I am really concerned about.
What I like about cash is that you can spend it with anyone at any time without committing money in a channel and LN doesn't allow that. So by counting on LN to scale, bitcoin would de facto give up on the ambition to be a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. I wish people would be more honest about it.

Yay! I can get scammed for 5% cheaper! I cannot believe this is upvoted on r/bitcoin....

Except that, according to developpers, the limiting factor is bandwith, and in this domain exponenital growth is still very much on:

I find it hard to believe that twenty years from now we won't be able to run a node on a mobile with 8GB blocks.

It's Gavin who put Wladimir in charge of Bitcoin Core, so yeah for me  deposing Gavin without even saying at least thanks is a complete asshole move as a human being. But maybe it is my understanding of English.

What if you hire a developper to write you a program which find the prime decomposition of big numbers? Your contract can detect if the program works (without being able to find a solution itself) and pay the developper if it does. If might seem far fetched to you but there are many problems in computer science for which deciding if something is a solution is easy but finding a solution is hard. For those a smart contract is a great tool.
Anyways nobody claim that Lawyer and  notaries will disappear completely, it's just that smart contract can act as a lubricant in the economy so that Lawyers are brought only in cases of serious disputes. For example, one of the application I like would be for event tickets. You could put a smart contract on a public blockchain that send a token representing a ticket to each adress which sent the right amont of ether to the contract. I think that's pretty elegant and more efficient than ticket masters.

Maybe this decision makes sense from a practical point of view but this is an extremely unclassy way to kick out the very person that trusted you and put you in this position. The least you could have done is to thank him in this blog post. I cannot judge the coder but you do not seem like a good person.
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:25:54
Well say that you create tokens that represent tickets. You can write a contract which send one of those token to any adress who sent a fixed quantity of ether to the token. This way is someone wants to prove that he has a ticket he just have to prove that he has the key corresponding to this adress which is doable without revealing the key itself.
In my opinion, what blockchains  provide in a representation of  ownership which is both unfalsifiable and verifiable by anyone. If you combine this with the ability to write program (smart contracts) that deal with this representation of ownership and can send it from adress to adress, I think you can cut a lot of middle mans and build a much more efficient economy. Some people don't, only time will tell.
