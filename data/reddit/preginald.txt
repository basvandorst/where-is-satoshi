Although they do state that they are an Australian registered business I get a feeling that something isn't right. Maybe it's the slight mistrust in the word "Reserve" in a financial context. Maybe it's this whole excuse that AUD funds are converted to USD due to liquidity seems off. Oh well time will tell.

Wondering if anyone here has heard of this company or any of the chiefs?

Thanks kiisfm, I have recently developed a helpful habit of scanning r/bitcoin daily to keep my finger on the pulse.

Actually it appears they may be hacking people's paypal account and paying you via their accounts and taking the Bitcoins. An associate of mine sent .2 BTC and it got pulled from someone else's paypal account. He was contacted by them. They asked what did they pay for and how did it get paid for. He had to send them their money back and the .2 BTC are gone

Hey how long does it take to certify a tar file (1271 bytes )? I've got the typewriter animation looping in my Chromium browser for over 10 minutes now. OS is Arch linux 64bit
edit: I've taken a peek at the chrome dev console and I can see a _GET Request URL: with a json response of {"state":"paid","plan":"immediately"}. 
Status Code:304 Not Modified
P.S. I have replaced the string of numbers in the request url with "xxxxxx".  Could the script be stuck on my client side?

Cool thanks I'll try again.
