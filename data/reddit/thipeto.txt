Transactions per second, even with the Lightning Network implemented, doesn't win Visa or Mastercard debit payments (they're 400k transactions per second). There's another crypto like IOTA that do instantly transactions with no fees...just try to pay a coffee with you bitcoin and you will see

No, forget it. Download Electrum, It's about 100MB. Very easy to use, watch some tutorials first
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:29:29
Just opinion.

When Lightning Network is released any Blockchain based cryptocurrency will be able to use it or just Bitcoin?

ok, but can this full node ALSO earn satoshis? Otherwise there's no advantage u know what I mean
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:35:16
Got it. Thank you  really appreciated.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:11:43
No, it will not.

Legend! I'll donate some crypto when I make my decision to buy. Thanks

What is the other bitcoin sub instead this one?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:17:29
NOOB *(but good)* question: can I be just a node on the blockchain? I mean I'm not interested on mining, just being a FULL NODE and validating transactions and earn a few satoshis. Or just miners can validate transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:38:11
Thanks but you didn't answered my question: other crypto will be able to make use of the LN?
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:18:48
A crypto will be a success in a long term and it's not bitcoin. Bitcoin is like windows phone right now, still good but in decline. Sorry but it's the true there's other crypto with almost zero fees and even litecoin has more future

Hi. 3 questions.

I just downloaded BitPay and wrote my seed on paper. Now I just installed Electrum on my PC and can't recover the wallet using the words gave by BitPay. So:

1. Why the words didn't worked on Electrum? I think Electrum asked me 20 words and BitPay gave me 12, I'm not home to confirm.
2. Let's say BitPay vanished from playstore or windows store...how can I recover my coins?
3. How to transform a seed into a private key? Is it possible?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:05:47
Thanks, so I should use apps that gave me 20 words always? Also, there's a way to transform words in private keys? I mean, a bitcoin in the very start is a private key only. So now they have these "seeds" so you can't have a private anymore?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:30:56
Sad for you bro, people are crazy sometimes
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:23:53
Do you use a multiple crypto currency wallet? Or 3 differents?

I don't trade on Coinbase. What I'm asking is whick change looks like the MTGox today...MTGox was a shit exchange or was like Coinbase in the past?
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:23:44
How long did it take for the transaction to be completed?

@_date: 2018-03-18 21:31:47
maybe 6.5k
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:56:02
I started investing in crypto December 2017, so I don't know how MTGox exchange worked in the past. With what today's exchange does MT.Gox look like in terms of size, volume, reliability?
Trade Satoshi

Bitcoin was the first and the most secure, but not the better. I think it will not be used as a currency even if Lightning Network is out or the taxes drops.
