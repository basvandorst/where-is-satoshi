Being rich doesn't = being evil. Using a corrupt system to keep your power and wealth is. When bitcoin or some other decentralized system overtakes the current system, it doesn't matter who is rich because everyone will at least have an opportunity to govern themselves to a greater degree.

I hope that most wallet software uses good sources of entropy for unpredictable randomness, but without verifying the source, there is no where to know. Thats why its important to only use open source bitcoin related software.

return hashedTime % maxNumber 
is just meant to be an example of how non-secure psudeo randomness can work (relying solely on time as the seed)
Why would the node standard library not have access to the OS level randomness functions? They claim to... Do you have a source I can look at?

Not in every app though, I'm wondering about your thoughts on apps that just generate the seed for you.
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:03:12
You CAN spend them, once you take your seed out of effective cold-storage. This allows you to keep the private keys cold while still able to generate addresses and view balances online.
You move the seed to a spending wallet when you are ready to spend.

You never get 100% energy transfer. Using a mining rig to heat your building uses much more energy than using a traditional heater to get the same job done. That said, the the energy used to secure the network isn't wasted.
Also, converting large amounts of energy -&gt; money incentivizes the use of the cheapest (renewable) energy, which incentivizes innovation on the renewable energy front. Bitcoin will probably end up being good for the environment.

We would probably have links that redirect users out of the app to blockexplorer or blokchain or something to view balances. After dong some security checks we would probably add an API client in the app so balances could be displayed directly, but it is a potential security risk so we will approach with caution.

Why would anyone provide the liquidity to him directly? He can only receives much as he has in his channel capacity right?
@_date: 2018-10-29 13:31:12
Basically Andreas would need to pre-fund a channel the amount he expects to receive, spend all of that money somewhere (so that he has an empty channel) and THEN people would be able to pay him.
The point being he needs a liquidity provider, and he can't do it himself because then all the money in the channel would already be his.. It's an interesting problem. I'm really hopeful for payment channels but I don't think lightning is a be-all-end-all solution for scalability. Too many "gotchas"

I do mine myself, but I won't claim to be a mining expert. I was always under the impression that the owner of the mining pool typically constructs the blocks. If the owner is constructing the blocks, they can potentially censor transactions, play favorites, etc.

The most important thing is making sure that no one has access to your seed, but that you have no way of losing it. This is a hard problem because the easier it is for you to recover it the easier it is to be hacked.

No it couldn't be proven, but it also can't be proven that the BTC in two addresses that belong to the same seed are related. In other words, you gain basically nothing by doing what you are proposing.
I would recommend just using a privacy wallet for your spending (samourai for android) and keep your "savings" separate and more secure. Either paper wallet or give [ a peek. Its an opensource app where you can encrypt and backup passwords/pins/seeds conveniently.

Kind of.. its an interesting idea. If everyone who owns Bitcoin all of a sudden decided that it's only worth it to sell their Bitcoin at $20,000, then just like that, Bitcoin is worth $20,000. No new dollars entered the system.
The problem is that there are still too many people willing to part with their Bitcoin for 3500... If all Bitcoin holders valued their own bitcoins higher, the price would be higher.
IMO: as long as a signifigant portion of BTC users hold it purely as a speculation, and not because they prefer it as decentralized money, the price will continue to have crazy fluctuations that make no sense.
Anyone who looks back and says "BTC at 20000 was obviously a bubble" suffers from confirmation bias. Many of us believe that the freedom Bitcoin offers has an even higher dollar price.
@_date: 2019-06-05 17:06:47

Depends. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. For example, with paper it's more likely that it gets lost/stolen/damaged. With digital it's more likely it gets hacked. You can take extra precautions but that's the basics

How does one accept cash online then? In an automated fashion.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:58:15
Hmmm.... maybe:  
valid\_fee = (sats\_per\_byte) &gt; mb\_in\_block \*\* 2  
where mb\_in\_block is chosen by the miner (they would try to maximize profit by using the highest blocksize they can without excluding a large number of transactions).
mb\_in\_block could also of course have a hard cap at 32 mb or whatever, but the idea is that if a valid fee must be the square of the number of megabytes in a block you almost wouldn't need one because few people would pay that high of fees.

I agree with the 21 million limit because it has little to no effect on the system (Bitcoin can be divided infinitely, so whatever)
The 1MB limit has an effect on scaling, so it shouldn't be set in stone based on what was chosen in the beginning. For example, what if it was 1kb, 512b? Should it never be changed?
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:03:02
Depends on what you want. I personally dont use hardware wallets because I dont like trusting the manufacturer and its too expensive for my tastes. I use a software wallet (electrum samourai etc) and backup the seed in

Depending on how much and your security tolernace level:
Either a software wallet (app) on your phone or desktop, or a hardware wallet.

That is not true. 12.5 bitcoins are release every 10 minutes, no matter how many people (or how much resources) are mining around the globe. The only thing that changes is how many people are competing for those 12.5 bitcoins.
The number decreases over time, in a year or so it will be 6, then 3, etc etc. However, that does NOT mean it will require more energy to mine those bitcoins. The energy being utilized around the world to mine bitcoins is a function of the value of bitcoins vs the value of energy, and how much it is worth to us to keep the network secure by hashing.

Exchanges are good for purchasing bitcoin. Once you have bought it, you should transfer it to a wallet you own. Hardware wallets are good for some users, but a software wallet is good for different reasons as well. You can also look into paper wallets. If you are new and aren't storing more than thousands of dollars of bitcoin, you probably just want a software wallet.

It absolutely shouldn't be taboo to talk about these things. They should also be discussed over and over because we always have new people on the sub trying to learn. I believe that 1MB (or 4MB weight) isn't some holy magic number that we can never change away from. It's been a good number. Is it the right number for next year? I'm not sure... I tend to think the base layer should gradually increase at roughly the same rate that bandwidth (hardware in general) does. Moore's law hasn't been holding up super well recently, but my point still stands.
It is obvious that the only reason a cap exists is because of hardware restrictions. If we had unlimited bandwidth and storage capabilities there would be NO LIMIT. With that in mind, it seems rational that the limit should follow hardware capabilities fairly closely.
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:51:35
So was the decision to make it 1 MB in the first place central planning? My point being maybe 1 MB is the correct number for now, maybe that changes. The decisions need to be made.

The protocol doesn't de-anonymize users. I think you should take a look at it. It actually can be used to IMPROVE anonymity.
For instance, an opencap server can be configured to serve a NEW bitcoin address for each GET request. The alias could be "[anonomous$anonomous.cash]( The point is that now the user can share a human-readable alias that will represent his addresses, even if he loses keys or changes, wallets. It can even represent a BIP47 payment code!
An OpenCAP server COULD ignore this and just serve the same address over and over, and for some users who don't need anonymity, or may not even WANT anonymity this can be a good thing. The protocol is flexible.

Hey guys! I'm building this website to fulfill two needs that I believe are in the space:
1. A place where anyone can store private information (seeds, private keys) without the server being able to access that info. Similar to a web wallet, but built to store the seeds to any currency. (Can be used to store partial seeds for the super-paranoid)
2. A place to dynamically track address balances as they update. (I'm annoyed with having to put in my transactions and balances manually on apps like blockfolio)
Let me know what you think, or even better, contribute to the Github! (link on the site)
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:00:21
Your mom doesn't need to know that its an alias in the QR code! I think you are missing my point. The user is oblivious.
Your alias can be anonymous$anonymous.com. Or, if you are doing darknet shit just don't use an alias. As I said, aliases are not an end-all solution. They help us move into the market that Venmo and Casp-App currently satisfy. They way bitcoin works today my friends won't use it to split a check. They want more convenience. This gives front-end devs another tool to make UI/UX simpler for the user.
@_date: 2018-11-05 21:14:02
What is a centralized service? OpenCAP is a protocol, and we are working on open source server software so that people can run their own if they want to.
You could also use a centralized service if you choose. Some people will. Some won't. It provides a lot of convenience without having to give up access to private keys.
If decentralized DNS ever becomes a thing, OpenCAP can use it as well.

You haven't read the protocol! I'm not advocating address reuse at all. This protocol allows you to represent changing addresses with one alias. The address can change over time. No private keys are used.
Stupidity can be helped. It needs to be helped if we want adoption. Everyone makes stupid mistakes from time to time. Companies don't want to have to trust employees not to be stupid. A reset button is good.

It's a different use case. In some cases it would be best to use a QR code (like making payments to a merchant) But aliases provide a lot of benefits.
1. Privacy - If you post an alias online instead of an address, that alias can actually serve a NEW address for each payment. This means the government CANT spy. Or even better, use a BIP47 Payment code that an alias can represent.
2. Human-readability
3. An alias posted online never dies (because it can be updated). An old address may have the keys lost/stolen
4. One alias can represent multiple cryptocurrencies (if you are into that sort of thing) You don't need to give potential senders 10 options to choose from
5. Makes bitcoin easier for your mom to use (you may not think this is necessary but its a big deal)

Interesting. Yeah so basically the contract says: 1/10th of the time I will pay you 1 Satoshi. The Satoshi is still the unit used but you effectively are paying 1/10th each time. I don't understand yet how this is useful, but maybe it will be. Seems more "fair" to just emit the whole Satoshi on a known schedule.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:53:55
Like I said, I agree QR codes are better for making one-time payments to merchants. But for donations, or sharing among friends there are really good reasons to have aliases. You could even embed the alias in a QR code if you want for donations, the point is though that you can be using NEW addresses for each payment. And you can kill that alias if you stop using it (instead of having coins sent to a wallet with a compromised key)
It also just looks nice having something representing your brand/project. For example:

You're right, I cant. I state explicitly in the FAQ that the site should be used as an extra storage location. More people lose seeds than are hacked, especially newbies. However, as any good website owner, I can offer great uptimes. Hosted on AWS. Again, all this info is on the FAQ.

The good news is that if the address you are looking up on the block explorer is correct, then you have your coins. Sounds like samourai may be having issues. Definately contact support. Worst case scenario is you restore your wallet using your seed. Then you will have coin access.
@_date: 2019-01-25 22:49:49
Bitcoin fees are more specifically set based on the byte size of the transaction. More inputs, more outputs, and longer scripts means you will most likely need a higher fee in order for a miner to include your transaction in a block.
In your case, yes, more inputs means a higher fee. However, when you are moving out of your paper wallet you only have 1 input, so the fee should be quite low.
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:01:40
Oh yeah, absolutely. I was thinking the multiple inputs were all in the same transaction.

You aren't "done" if the alias is de-coupled from the wallet? For instance lets say a company has a donation address "[donate$business.com]( The company fires an employee for fraud that had access to their donation keys, or could have potentially stolen them. The company doesn't want to change their alias but needs that alia to represent a new set of addresses.
They may have not even lost funds yet, but want to transfer to a new wallet just in case.

Definitely not trying to reinvent the wheel. I'm familiar with Paynyms. I love paynyms but they don't satisfy the same requirement OpenCAP does:
1. OpenCAP works with any cryptocurrency/address format (P2PKH, P2SH, Bech32, BIP47), it also allows you to represent all your crypto different addresses using one alias (if you even care about more than BTC)
2. OpenCAP can be flexible. It isn't tied to private keys because there are many use cases where an entity would want to change which address is being represented by "[donate$bitcoin.org]( Maybe the owner changed, maybe a private key was compromised, etc.
3. OpenCAP isn't specific to a wallet or server, it is a protocol, not a service offered by a company.
4. Paynyms don't offer the same "can be communicated verbally" attribute. One of the major points of these aliases is you can TELL your friend your alias, you can tell your friend your address/payment code
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:30:57
HODLing doesn't help or hurt. HODLing temporarily helps keep price propped up, but for the price to stay up long term we need more systems that utilize bitcoin. That doesn't necessarily mean buying a shirt online with bitcoin helps much, but if that purchase encourages more shops to accept bitcoin then it does help. As far as adoption goes, its more about the influence your purchasing power has, and on whom you are excersizing it.

The seed is your bitcoin. There are many ways to store the seed, all with different pros and cons.
Paper - unhackable, but can be stolen, lost, or destroyed
Metal engraving, unhackable, and hard to destroy but can be stolen, lost, is inconvenient and can be expensive
Memorization - unhackable and cant be stolen, but can be easily forgotten and can't be passed on to loved ones if you die
Encrypted and stored digitally (works best for me) - Small chance of being hacked, but cant be forgotten easily, and can be backed up on multiple devices and in the cloud
An app we are developing for the best encrypted storage can be found in beta here: [

Let's assume crypto takes over the worlds monetary system (with BTC being the king), and fiat goes to 0.
Let's look at how several different types of people will be probably be affected:
1. Paycheck to paycheck worker: This person has some money in a 401k, a mortgage, and little to no cash in the bank. This person's 401k will likely lose whatever value percentage is in bonds (bonds are backed by fiat) but the stocks wont be affected. The mortgage will either be easily paid off by worthless fiat or just as hard to pay off as before in crypto (depending on how the legality works out with loans). Little money will be lost overall because they have almost no cash holdings. At the tipping point this person starts accepting salary in BTC.
2. Investor: Any investments backed by fiat are probably hosed (cash holdings, bonds). Stocks most likely aren't affected. And assets backed by fiat debt (mortgages) could be amazing because they only need to paid off in worthless fiat (again, depends on the legality)
3. Lender: This person has the highest risk of getting totally fucked. Everyone potentially pays off their huge loans in worthless fiat. Im interested in how the legal system will work with this.

Geez answer the question people! I would say the mobile apps are typically safer. The only realm in which they aren't may be that auto update is typically enabled by default. Desktop usually gives you mean re control and features but higher chance of malware.
All the people yelling for trezors: trezors are fine, but they aren't the only solution. There is a heavily overlooked problem which is: you have to have complete trust in the manufacturer. I prefer open source software. Mobile wallets and an open source password manager for backups.
