&amp;nbsp;To me it does not seem that the debug.log contains any errors, it is just downloading the blockchain from what it looks like to me? Maybe you see something I don't.

Yes now it seems to work! All because I set a short/easy password? My previous password was too long I guess? What is the limit?

I have not been able to get a public ip for my Lightning Node on the Raspberry pi. The Raspberry pi and my desktop computer is connected to a router and my Bitcoin node on my desktop computer manage to get a public ip with incoming connections. I have port forwarding 9735 and 18333. I am not sure this is a question that fit in here because it is probably not related to the Lightning Node but I would appreciate any help you can give.

Yes that seem to work, thanks! What I did was that I used a faucet to send to all my Witness addresses I found in my wallet using bitcoin-cli listaddressgroupings. I am not sure what address lightning uses but I guess I will find out when I start spending on LN.

I have a problem running the command bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo. I have tried running the command with user bitcoin and user pi using ssh and this is the console outputs I get:
pi user:
&amp;nbsp;**pi $ bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo**
error: Could not locate RPC credentials. No authentication cookie could be found, and no rpcpassword is set in the configuration file (/home/pi/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf)
&amp;nbsp;**pi $ which bitcoin-cli**
&amp;nbsp;**pi $ /usr/local/bin/bitcoin-cli getbalance**
error: Could not locate RPC credentials. No authentication cookie could be found, and no rpcpassword is set in the configuration file (/home/pi/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf)
&amp;nbsp;My config file is located at /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf as the guide specifies and I can see that pi user is looking in its own user directory but the guide says to use the bitcoin user and here is the console output I get:
&amp;nbsp;**bitcoin $ systemctl status bitcoind.service**

I have been trying to connect to 40+ nodes but all fail for different reasons:
* parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 4
* curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
* wallet returned error: fr.acinq.eclair.blockchain.bitcoind.rpc.JsonRPCError: Insufficient funds (code: -4). I assume this is my wallet that has insufficient funds but when I run bitcoin-cli getbalance it says 1.09 and my open channel commands looks something like this: eclair-cli open 02575c8b82dcb4b2936ef52326fa952127f9e85748b50abec4111bbd35e834b855 100000 0
* lost connection to ...
&amp;nbsp;Does anyone have a node that they know is working and will accept any/my connection? This would hopefully help me narrow down my problem.

Have you thought about including Lightning Network Factories in the illustration?

&amp;nbsp;I don't have a file /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/debug.log, I can see a debug.log in /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/testnet3/debug.log but that file is huge (8+ mb) and I do not know how to get it from the ssh console to reddit as nano (from Putty) does not seem to want to scroll down while I am trying to mark all text. Do I have to use scp or something like that to transfer the file from the Raspberry to my primary computer?
&amp;nbsp;Maybe I should start from the top of the guide and try again? I don't want to take your time.

I tried now using 90 characters including special characters and it still works. When it was not working before I must have included a special character I cannot seem to find at the moment. Mashing the keyboard for the rpcpassword might not be a good idea even though it says in the guide I don't have to remember the password :-)

I unlocked the wallet using bitcoin-cli walletpassphrase PASSWORD_[D] 600. After then I try to open a channel to eclair node using:
* eclair-cli connect 03933884aaf1d6b108397e5efe5c86bcf2d8ca8d2f700eda99db9214fc2712b134
* eclair-cli open 03933884aaf1d6b108397e5efe5c86bcf2d8ca8d2f700eda99db9214fc2712b134 1000000 0
* tail -f /home/bitcoin/.eclair/eclair.log gives error message: wallet returned error: fr.acinq.eclair.blockchain.bitcoind.rpc.JsonRPCError: Insufficient funds (code: -4). I do not understand why as I have followed the transaction instructions 
**bitcoin-cli addwitnessaddress ADDRESS_[B]** and 
**bitcoin-cli sendtoaddress WITNESSADDR_[C] BALANCE_[A] "" "" true**
*  bitcoin-cli getbalance: 1.099

I don't think I had any special characters, only letters and numbers but my password was probably 50 characters. I can try to set a longer password again to see when it fails and report back. Thank you for the help!

In my country less than 1% of people use cash. People even get annoyed if you offer them cash. Some charities you would like to have some privacy and not have the banks and governments to know all your moves. I know this is not the case in USA but some countries barely have cash anymore and that is a problem.

More decimals can be introduced, in 2025 it is possible Bitcoin has lets say 6 more decimals and fees are average 0.0001 satoshis. This is not a likely scenario, i'm just saying it can be done.
@_date: 2018-08-25 15:05:19
Increasing the number of decimals is possible easily with a hard fork and maybe also with a soft fork (someone might figure this out in the future).

Find a job where the employer pays you in Bitcoin. I know some youtubers pay people Bitcoin to edit and prepare content for publication. Many remote jobs where the employer and employee live in different countries are especially suitable for payment in Bitcoin.

They are buying Bitcoin in mass? That would mean normal people are selling in mass right now and that would be really really bad. Individuals need Bitcoin before institutions get them and if this video is true there is a massive wealth transfer from the little guy to institutions... very bad!

If an alt currency managed to make a significant innovation Bitcoin would copy it and there are huge economic incentives for this to happen (even if this means hard forking and/or importing the utxos into another format). Copying new features that seem good right away is very dangerous of course and that is why it is not all bad that alt coins exist to battle test the features before they are integrated into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-31 16:44:45
Miners would have had to have saved Bitcoin for a very long time for the amount to be significant since there is only 3.8% inflation or something like that. If only miners are selling I think using the words "in mass" is a stretch.

"A blockchain for the people?"
If you want the answer to be yes they need to use Bitcoin. In all other cases where a central party is in control it is always a blockchain against the people. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 13:13:53
I am saying it is my oppinion (I think most people agree that it is better that each person owns a little bit of Bitcoin compared to companies owning all/most Bitcoin) that I think it is bad. People and companies can do what they want of course, I just think it would be better for society overall if Bitcoin is distributed well among individuals instead of being owned mostly by corporations.

I have a tiny gold bar I bought 15 years ago for its  store of value properties and I have not sold it or used it in any way even once in 15 years. I hold my Bitcoin in the same way, I might not use any of it for the next 20 years. A big difference between gold and Bitcoin though is the ease of use, when I do decide to spend gold or Bitcoin it is way easier to spend some of the Bitcoin.

So that is how you communicate with the Bitcoin satellites, nice!

That helped me get a public ip! Thanks!
