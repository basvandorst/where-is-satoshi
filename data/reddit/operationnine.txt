Been living in a camping ground for the last 6 months after I lost my job. Have been doing everything I can to get myself back together. Going through some tough times right now so anything would be appreciated..

About to buy a lot more.

Sure does feel comfortable sitting it out in Ether.

ETH is way faster, and cheaper.

They are smart. With potential Brexit just around the corner they'll make a killing on small tx fees.

The havling will cause mass painic buys, thats just human nature. You take away something they want more of, they will begin to quickly pay more in fear of 'missing out'.

I completely agree, the blocks have been coming in crazy fast
@_date: 2016-07-14 11:33:28
You mean Ethereum? Lol.
@_date: 2016-07-08 07:49:49
Bitcoiners do not sell, they HODL!
@_date: 2016-07-07 04:30:35
What is happening?
@_date: 2016-07-09 15:03:55
