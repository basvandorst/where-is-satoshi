I think I'm doing this right? This would seriously mean a lot to me, I don't have any coins or money and could totally use this to get my brother something for his birthday.
**EDIT:** It looks like some people are going on a downvote tirade. Lets get some upovotes in here. I tried to offset it but I can only do so much.

That's me right now... :|

Jesus, that one hurt to listen to.

Still, doesn't this mean she missed out on like 90 million dollars?

I really really wish I wasn't broke at the moment :(

The top and bottom charts form a heart when you think of them as one single image.
**EDIT:** ~~I'm not entirely sure why this was downvoted.~~ I'm positive again, thanks.

And then from a "Sell" to a "Don't Buy"!

Of all the circlejerks on reddit Banks seem to be one of the few that actually deserve the hate.

Even if we did they would still sell it to the guy who outbids everyone including Reddit. There's no way we could get enough people together to outbid *everyone.*

Everyone bitches about this yet I myself *wish* I was making enough money to have this much taken out of my paycheck.

Idk, why but this was refreshingly optimistic.
@_date: 2015-05-02 00:51:26


Atleast that's what I choose to believe.

Buckle up, Buckaroo!
**EDIT:** I'm not sure if I am getting an error but this comment score was instantaneously a 0 the moment I submitted it. Is there a bot in this thread?

Don't you know that I don't know how to read Japanese therefore no one knows how to read Japanese?

It had to slingshot back to Earth a bit but that's all part of the trajectory.

On one hand I want 200 dollar bitcoin to buy, on the other that would mean that bitcoin is once again only worth 200 dollars.

It's okay, he's shorting his bet to various financial institutions for a payout nearly twice as big as his losses!
Hooray free-marketism!

I feel like half the bitcoins have gone missing because of everyone in this thread.
@_date: 2016-02-18 17:33:25
I mean you could say a lot of things...and that's one of 'em!

Never seen an "lol" get so highly upvoted on reddit.
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:32:39
Yeah, you get put on a list for pretty much anything. Searching a vast list of words that are seemingly arbitrary can get you on their list. Sweeping, dictionary, and ISS are all things that get you flagged on PRISM.
