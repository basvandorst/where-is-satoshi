Granted, all of this is in a magical fairytale land where deflation doesn’t exist and  rides a flying lambo ��

Agreed, and pick back up again in October. Bottom in September when the new comers are drained from watching everyday

You’re not alone. Most everyone on this thread has felt the same pain over the years. Then they cross over to the hodl side and find peace.

Are we just buying Mt Gox at the price they determined to sell at? If they sell too quick the price goes down, if they sell slow the price stays relatively the same. If this is the case, they might have decided to sell in between 8-9000 over the next few months and we should get used to them controlling  the market not letting it get too high by selling off as soon as it start reaching 10,000 to bring us back down to 9,000.

You think people are still currently fomo'ing?

Agreed, until gox whale is finished dumping the price isn't going much higher than 10,000. I'm pretty sure they agreed to sell around 10,000 so they'll just bring the price back down as it inches up.

Thanks, where do you get that info?
