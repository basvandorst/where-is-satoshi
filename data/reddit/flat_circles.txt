Yeah it reads more like mismanagement than scam to me.

I take your point but for me it's mainly the ability to buy a range of altcoins directly with AUD that appeals about the big exchanges. Especially Coinspot. Although the ease and convenience suddenly doesn't seem worth it when you get effected by situations like this... Localbitcoins is a solid backup option for sure. Thanks for reminding me it exists!

I can confirm the part about Poli payments being reversed.
I just received the below email.


Funny thing is, the LTC I purchased via BTC Markets is long gone (moved to another exchange and altcoin). I will probably return their money as it's the right thing to do but I think I'll hold off doing that until the situation becomes a bit clearer... Just in case.
Edit: I should mention that this Poli payment was made a week ago, before the temporary pause on Poli deposits came in to effect.

Exactly the same situation as me. Do you have coins/aud locked up in there at the moment?
