Coinbase does shady stuff like insider trading for altcoins, pumping altcoins, and randomly emailing users to sell their bitcoin for altcoins. They're also unreliable during heavy traffic periods and don't necessarily care that bitcoin succeeds.  They've supported controversial hardfork and hired judges from the silkroad case as advisors.
With that said they have always processed my requests (with high fees) and cashed me out.  So you'll get bitcoin if you're buying and get usd if your selling but they're considered bad actors in bitcoin by many people.

This was an interesting podcast I listened to this morning.  David is hosting a bitcoin conference in June and wants to bring the community together with a lightning network arcade, bitcoin commercial contest for a 10k prize, and many other events (  
This guy has a positive vision and emphasized this is what we should be focusing on instead of spreading toxicity against alts or personalities in the space. In his opinion the battle is already won bitcoin has nakamoto consensus and we should move forward.  Also in my opinion we shouldn't stoop to the levels of trolls, the network speaks for itself.  
I've also been thinking a lot about greg maxwell's post the other day on the difficulties of developing.  I just think it would help all of us if we were all cool and respectful. (

Yeah it's unreasonable to expect customers to wait for 1-3 confirm and merchants to accept 0 confirms, bitcoin's merchants will need to use lightning for small purchases in the future.  
Don't sweat the downvotes they're probably upset with altcoin shilling.  Like for instance dash had some ridiculous "bug" in its launch and mined like millions of coins for the creator and close friends.  It wasn't a fair launch so it turned a lot of people off.  Also there are security trade offs and whatnot.

There are too many moving parts to propose a crazy solution like inflating bitcoin. 
you can't assume the mining reward will remain proportional to the marketcap.  Miners are all about maintaining profitability with the situation the market gives them.  If bitcoin went to 100-150k by 2050 the current mining fee reward is enough to maintain current security, and that's not counting any mining chip or energy use improvements.  
In this respect bitcoin is doing exceptionally well it shouldn't even be a topic of debate.
On top of that there are solutions like merge mined sidechains for miners to make additional fees (RSK network).  Also for the end user paying for transaction data it's only going to get more efficient.
@_date: 2019-11-28 06:37:59
What if you needed a blockchain so secure and decentralized that you could pin real life data and assets to worldwide in real time?  Bitcoin naturally becomes the unit of value for this technology.   
The way it's being built out isn't how you understand it.  Bitcoin layer 1 is hardening off to keep it stable and now 2nd layer is being built out.  Also layer 1 smart contract schemes are being added in a softfork in the future (with some other privacy and efficiency upgrades).  
Just because some shitcoin couldn't succeed on shaky ground doesn't mean bitcoin won't.  It's just going to take some time.  
All the indicators are there.  The global economy is a mess.  A new era of order and efficiency backed by the bitcoin blockchain is the future.  Just look into the technology. (not what shills repeat)  For instance 1 mainchain transaction could be 10,000s of LN transaction, 100s of batched transactions, a multi-sig wallet address, and new transaction schemes are being built out all the time with new contract code and capabilities that give this unique "blockchain" value.
@_date: 2019-11-04 01:51:45
Also another topic of debate for mining fees in the future is the futures market that will be created around it.  
Right now miners are using the spot price of bitcoin to short it and guarantee profitability for any difficulty period.  In the future when transaction fees are a major source of miner income, there will be a futures market between service providers and miners so each party can maintain business operations in the event of transaction fee volatility (heard jack mallers talk about this idea on stephan livera's podcast) 
The system is being built out and reinforced making it stronger ever day.  It isn't time to discuss a situation like a hardfork inflation change.

those seed words do not recover funds that are in channels and do not recover after the channels are closed 
you need to be able to access your node to recover funds that were allocated at the time it went down even if those channels were closed by your peer honestly

The market values an immutable distributed ledger.  It would be impossible to maintain a ledger for every transaction in the world.  Every throughput increase bumps requirements of node operators.  These node operators are what keeps the system distributed and decentralized.  They're not compensated and do this for personal reasons or service provider reasons.  
Bitcoin is about being sovereign and taking control.  It's suggested you run your own node to verify the network you interact with.  If you don't run your own node, you are trusting a service provider or at the very least giving up data on your transactions.  
So we can't make block size unlimited.  This would throw many users and smaller service processors out of sync.  It would eventually boil down to only banks and payment processors to having the only copies of the ledger.  This movement was born out of a distrust of banks.  
Nobody is forcing you to play along.  You can trust a poorly designed less secure bitcoin copy if you don't believe in the methods we're using.  
The top priority is for users to remain sovereign.  Sacrificing this erodes the value of the system.  Lightning is a way to have 1000s of transactions consolidate into one.  The truth is buying a coffee on mainchain bitcoin doesn't make sense.  Everyone in the planet having to download that transaction and propagate and verify it doesn't scale.  If you try to, you break the system that made bitcoin valuable.   By consolidating 1000s of transactions a store made into 1 transaction to main chain a month instead of 7431 transactions you can scale bitcoin.  Users like you or me can store our wealth in a cold wallet and manage our channel once every few months.  
I can go on but you sound like you have a lot to learn about this technology.

We have different conditions this time.
Last time the miners were very profitable in the run up to CME futures.  They didn't have to sell most of their mined coins to break even.  The miners "capitulated" in January of 2015 at $171. From the start of 2015 to the end of 2017 (35 months) bitcoin 110x in value.  This created a scenario where bitmain had a lot of coins (71,560 BTC at the start of 2017).  They offloaded about 50,000 BTC by 1st quarter of 2018 and were left with 20k BTC (as shown in their IPO filing). We will not have this type of selling pressure at the launch of the new BAKKT futures. Bitcoins are 5x more difficult to mine at 10k then they were the last time we were at 10k in DEC/JAN of 2017/2018.  
This is just one angle I see that wouldn't create the type of pressure CME futures.  Also these are physically backed with real bitcoin.

I requested a withdraw waited a week and the withdraw was cancelled.  I contacted support and needed to provide additional KYC and the withdraw was processed later that day. 
I liked poloniex P2P lending more than these services.  Blockfi feels new and unpolished and I don't think I'd trust them with my coins again.  Maybe down the line they'll get better and more legitimate competitors will pop up but the juice isn't worth the squeeze for me right now.

We're building a better economic system.  That's fine if you want to subscribe to your econ 101 state funded opinions.  The fact is when you purposely make money worth less through inflation and cheap/negative rates you're forcing people to park their money in houses and land.  Then you see an entire generation that can't afford a house.  When you subsidize farming in USA you make the products unfairly cheap and it puts mexican farmers out of business.  So they come over the border by the 10s millions.  These people work for less and that shakes up the market for americans.  Every intervention in the free market creates ripple effects and that's why bitcoin is better.  It's in its infancy but grows stronger and more stable everyday.  Free markets and austrian economics are better.  Eventually more and more people will realize this out of necessity due to collapsing currencies and economies.  This time the alternative has built in security and world wide acceptance.  It's revolutionary, but you won't realize this by absorbing state sponsored econ teachings.

I've seen 3 bitcoin ATMs in the past week just walking around
one at a sheetz gas station, one at the coinstar kiosk in a grocery store, and one at the local mall
They're great, can't wait until turbo channels are implemented into these machines.  The mainchain interaction at each and every ATM transaction will become obsolete if we get a major boost in usage, and to continue the ATM business model they need to look into turbo channels.
Turbo channels are prepaid channels that sit in the mempool but allow instant spending capability in the lightning network.  It simplifies the user experience immensely with few trade offs in security.

The posts on reddit don't reflect the ideology of many serious bitcoiners.  The development community still has bitcoin's roots and OG bitcoiners are promoting and building apps that reflect this message.  
We're in a bear market but it's not nearly as bad as it was in 2015.  There's a lot of cool stuff being developed, but at the end of the day we need adoption and money velocity.  The FED and other central banks are making it easier for us to succeed.  
Henry Ford has a quote about the mentality of make vs get.  We need to make useful apps, make secure services, make educational material, etc. instead of get money, get gains, get rewarded for nothing.  I have a passion for bitcoin and the price doesn't really bother me.  I want this project to succeed and want to make things that make the world better and the price will follow.

0 conf is dangerous and doesn't scale
Having customers use on chain 0 conf would drive a business over insane.  It would be like writing a check for a beer and waiting for a settlement 3rd party to confirm the transfer.  It's a beer have the sales over lightning and settle up to the main chain once a night or once a week or whatever fits the business model most efficiently 
A couple bars using 0 conf break the 7 tps, a lot of bars using 0 conf breaks the network's node decentralization due to needed consensus changes 
It just doesn't work.  It'll take a little while to get it if you're new but you'll see this is a great technology 
Even if bitcoin goes to 1 million a coin and a satoshi is 1 penny, a 0 conf will cost over a dollar probably a few dollars for a 1 sat/byte.  Lightning scales because it can transfer msats 1/1000 a satoshi and have routing fees set at fractions of a satoshi 
This divisiability would allow payments for beer by the ml or streaming by the second its vastly superior than an on chain and at the end if the day it all settles on main chain anyways
@_date: 2019-04-01 21:27:11
I'm not here to FUD the network but there needs to be some upgrades before people start running their own nodes.  Right now on lnd if you lose access to your node, the 24 word recovery will not give you access to any bitcoin in channels even if they are closed.  There are also problems on recovering funds if you don't have the latest state of your channels (you can be penalized because the network assumes you're cheating if you upload an old state)
We need watchtowers, AMP, and some type of science on where to allocate liquidity to strengthen the network.  The devs are working really hard, and what's being done now is great, but I wouldn't recommend operating a node unless you're tech savvy.   
So yeah I'm excited to see the developments and apps, but bit_faced is kind of right we're some time away from a smooth developed mature network.

If Alice keeps her money in the channel and the funding transaction is dropped from the mempool, Alice loses her bitcoin 
She can spend that bitcoin as long it's confirmed or remains in the mempool.  Another issue is if Bob's node doesn't have balanced channels, or if Bob charges large routing fees.  I suppose who you buy bitcoin from is important using this method, some reputation would go a long way.  
You don't have to do this method at all.  It just makes it extremely easy, fast and efficient for users.
@_date: 2019-09-20 17:35:57
it's open sourced, you retain custody, and the KYC is required for the fiat onramp
It works just as well without KYC.  If you want to sell bitcoin for cash at a meetup it works all the same.  
The issue is you're making a channel with someone that's preloaded, they can spend it before a confirmation so no risk for you because you have their money and little to no risk for them because they can spend right away

the devs gave themselves 12,000,000 coins for free and premined 60,000,000 which they ICO'd for bitcoin
Their model is a bloat chain that allows as much on chain activity as the miners decide.  This means that it's the miners not the devs not the users who choose the hardware requirement to keep a node.  They obscure that fact by offering a pruned node or something that isn't validating the network while saying it is a full node.
They rolled back the chain to save some developer's and insider's money when their first big Dapp was exploited the DAO, and subsequently have been in heated debate over which Dapps to help and which not to help in every hardfork.  This caused some devs to quit when discussing a chain change to get the Parity multisig coins back.  
It's a centralized mess and will only get worse.

We all want immutable, secure, decentralized, scale-able, fairly distributed, fungible, hard currency
One of the only interesting projects other than bitcoin is grin because it solved some privacy and scale ability problems in a unique way using mimble wimble.  It's not as secure, developed, or user friendly as bitcoin but it isn't a total shitcoin like 99%+ of the projects out there.
Also let's say for instance an altcoin does provide something that bitcoin doesn't, it doesn't mean that bitcoin won't provide that.  Bitcoin devs developed segwit and that was integrated into at least 3 blockchains before it gained consensus on bitcoin.  Schnorr signatures are integrated into at least 1 chain I know of and they are going to be in the next bitcoin segwit softfork I believe but that's still some time away.  Look at ETH they have those smart contract coins.  Bitcoin has a merged mined 2nd layer using that exact programming language called rootstock.  The thing is that bitcoin refuses to sacrifice the fundamentals that make it function in a secure decentralized manner.
