i currently use [blockchain.com]( with 2FA but i bought a U2F usb to make it more secure but blockchain only seems to work with yubikey 
is it worth finding a new wallet that will let me use my U2F usb or is U2F not that much of an upgrade from 2FA generated codes (not sms)

i would be able to resore the wallet funds with the 12 word backup phrase that i have stored on paper right?
also i could print of the password onto paper? thats allways an option 
my question is will my 12 word backup work if  Electrum stops making the program?
or will i be able to back it up with any running bitcoin wallet at the time?

ok what i have done is made an electrum wallet with 2fa and  a 128 + character password thats saved to my password manager (also with 2fa on it) then i have a shorter 2nd part to the password thats only stored on paper incase my password manager (bitwarden open source) ever gets hacked 
so if they get the first part of the password they will still need to get the 2nd part 
does this sound like a good solution for stroing around £250

i should be fine as long as i dont lose the 12 word seed 
can you reccomend how i can make sure i dont lose the 12 word seed? 
@_date: 2019-02-19 20:39:12
yes its a 3rd party service called bitwarden they are open sourced and have been audited and i have 2fa on the account + they only have part of my password! :D i trust them
good idea im going to leave instrustions incase i jump infront of a bus ;) 
thanks for your help
