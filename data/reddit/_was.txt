Mining represents a static supply of bitcoin in the supply/demand model. It's worth taking into account in regards to how much money it costs to procure bitcoins, as miners will have to sell at twice the price assuming hash rate remains equal.

Support at 300, hashing rate is as such now that it isn't feasible for miners to sell lower, especially or even with new chip tech, depending on whether you have it or not.

and how do blocks "agree" to larger size?

I really appreciate your input and I think I'll write another post over on github as well. 
However, I never made claims to what Satoshi would like, but I could infer that he would view the current lack of cooperation and collaboration within the BTC community as both juvenile and a risk to the future of bitcoin and the world as a whole.
What I said was :I think with Satoshi AFK, we are satoshi, because Satoshi never wanted to be CEO of bitcoin, or what-have-you. 
My connection to how nature utilizes the Fibonacci sequence as it's method for cellular division and growth is an attempt to connect a tried and true method for growth(of any kind) to Bitcoin's block-size. 
I think that the network doesn't need an 8MB blocksize until it's already surpassed the maximum tx/s of 2MB, 3MB and subsequently 5MB. It's a good way to do this gradually and as painlessly as possible, the fact that nature utilizes the same equation just gives credibility because, you know... Nature's made it this far.

Localbitcoins acts as an escrow service for your bitcoins, to ensure that the seller gets their money and you get your bitcoins. 
The simplest way to buy bitcoins in my experience is to set up a purchase on localbitcoins for Moneygram for X amount of BTC and you can then walk into a Walmart, fill out a sending form with the Recipients info (The person you're buying the coins from) and then mark the invoice on LBC as "paid" and then you can pay cash or credit/debit right at the counter and have your coins within 12 hours or a couple hours if their Moneygram is in your timezone. No identity verification, no bs. 
don't use circle, circle is for squares. Nothing against Brian Armstrong but Coinbase takes forever...

Sounds all well and good, but how does Bitcoin XT currently plan to implement an increasing block-size limit? Dynamically I hope?
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:28:26
Well that must really verify my notions that our community is incompetent. Bitcoin XT is a different currency and blockchain, correct? 
just read up on XT...
Bitcoin XT looks like a bandaid over an uncleaned wound. We need a dynamic block-size limit and we need it as soon as possible or the network will never be scalable. I think i'm gonna go elsewhere with this proposal, though.

The idea that we should favor a less effective method of preparing bitcoin for "growing up" just because it's "complex" gives me the feeling that our community isn't necessarily ready for bitcoin to "grow up". Its JUST a geometric sequence backed by cryptography. Something about just "doubling" Block size every 2 years seems a little not up to par with the complexity of bitcoin. 
"Even the most bandwidth-constrained miners in China have said they can handle 8MB blocks, so that is a good place to start."
I understand miners can handle the load, but when It comes to the backbone of the network, the nodes, I believe that we need to try and make it so ANYONE can create a bitcoin node. Just because the miners can handle it, doesn't mean the nodes can.
In addition, we can adopt clients that allow larger blocks while still allowing backwards compatibility. (clients that cap blocks at 1MB). 
Now I have a question about XT,  Will The Satoshi clients just not accept the larger blocks, or any block relayed by a client that allows larger blocks?
"We could always turn around and limit the block size again later"
    You mean a hard fork when the network is 100x the size it is now?... I think not. (It takes a hard fork to reverse a soft fork)
I think I'm going to go ahead and go for a BIP so we can get to consensus. Because even though it's currently "not broken so why fix it " situation, It will not always be that way, and it's best to address an issue before it begins to plague the network and rack up a huge backlog of txs.
I think the best way for us to handle this issue is to implement this geometric block-size sequence into our clients and allow the block size to remain at 1MB until the last 144 Blocks are over 900kb. At least then our software will be prepared.

Historically, some of the greatest innovations in technology have been analogous and/or inspired by nature.
Remember, feel free to comment and criticize my proposal.
We NEED to come together. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:45:47
But isn't Bitcoin XT just a fork of Bitcoin with dynamic block size then? 
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:50:12
Why do we need an 8MB max block size, before we have a 2MB block size limit, 3MB , and 5MB , and then, when necessary, 8MB... 
When I run an XT node right now, I'm just voting: my node still serves the network like Satoshi node, correct? 
Looks like the average full-ness of the last 100 Blocks doesn't even exceed 500kb... 
Also, I'm sorry for all the questions, but how does it go about the double every two years? Every 105190 Blocks? And how, cryptographically, does it implement the end of the doubling? Won't this allow the blockchain to become extremely large? So large that it makes people who want to start new nodes have to wait months to have an up-to-date blockchain? I understand that the speed of the internet is going to increase over time, but proportionate to the exponentially increasing size of the blockchain? Perhaps not.

way things are going, even the 5 cent transactions will eventually appreciate to a large transactions due to deflation
@_date: 2015-09-08 20:23:36
absolutely incorrect. Blockstream is a company, you can hate a company's plan for bitcoin due to the fact that they plan to monetize on certain aspects of their proposals at the expense of the network and community's robustness, without hating bitcoin or the idea of a decentralized digital currency.

Supply will get cut in half next year, that is, the supply of new coins into the ecosystem. Demand is expected to rise as well. You understand supply and demand, correct?

Bitcoin core has been called bitcoin Qt since the GUI existed.. The client had "generate coins" button, but the client that had the wallet loaded was 0.2  and did not include the button, I think I stopped mining when the GPU arms race began and my Nvidia cards couldn't pay for themselves (at current market price, that is). Anyhow, a lot of people who are interested in their finances are now just the slightest bit (no pun intended) curious about Bitcoin.

Just cold storage the keys, print them out on a piece of paper, you can use blockchain.info for this. This is my preferred method of LTS

Take a look at what happened to Litecoin Pre-halving. Hype builds, pump goes up exponentially higher than double the price for half of the supply, and then settles down to double of where it was premature to halving. SnD
