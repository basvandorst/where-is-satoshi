On behalf of other shibes, I'd like to apologize for this one, apparently we forgot to put his leash on and medicate his doge food.

In that case, add your explanation as a comment to thejakartaglobe.com article in order to refute their misinterpretation and/or FUDs. Oh, and come to we need more Indonesian redditors there.

It's 586.74 at coinbase, 12 hours later after you wrote that. What do you think the bottom will be?

You are talking as if John has intellectual property rights and patented exclusive royalty on the thesis. Had that been the intention, John's thesis won't be open-sourced when it was launched.

Not on this issue. The Indonesian government's stance on Bitcoin did not change compared to its last statement: Bitcoin is still illegal for any kind of payment inside Indonesia. This "indirectly recognize as legal" is nothing but a (willful?) misinterpretation by on the original statement, which was released in Bahasa Indonesia.
See my comment [here]( for a better translation and interpretation of the statement from Bank Indonesia.

I am Indonesian so I can give you a more accurate translation. The quote that you mentioned above came from [Article 21 of the Law No. 7/2011]( which said that:
    1. Rupiah is obligatory to be used in:
       a. Any transaction made for the purpose of payment. (i.e. paying something)
       b. Settlement of other obligations that must be fulfilled with money.
       c. Other financial transactions that is being executed within the territory of the Republic of Indonesia.
    2. The obligation referred to in Paragraph (1) shall not apply to:
       a. Specific transactions made in order to execute the government budgets.
       b. Accepting foreign gifts or sending gifts abroad.
       c. International trade transactions.
       d. Deposits in the form of foreign currencies.
       e. International financing transactions. (e.g. loans from international banks)
Number (1) pretty much **forbid Cryptocoins to be used in any kind of payment inside Indonesia.** Heck, even listing your prices in USD and accepting USD in lieu of IDR is illegal. Which is why the chance of seeing Indonesian businesses accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment is practically nil.
What they can do is treating Bitcoins as commodities instead of currencies, and obliging people to exchange their coins to fiat before making transactions, but that need a different kind of official statement from Bank Indonesia.

How do we know when it hit the rock bottom, when it will continue to go down? Is there some market analysis tools that we can use to identify this?

Calm down dude, we don't need to take the bait and lower our standard to his. Everyone reading this can see that he is a pure troll trying to drag you down to his level.

As much as I want to agree with you, that rationale will not held much in the court. Exchanging Bitcoin in return for services and products are definitely payment transactions.
Indonesians can probably get away with purchasing something from abroad using Bitcoins and have it sent to Indonesia, but for businesses *inside* Indonesia, attempting to sell their product or service in exchange of Bitcoins is definitely still illegal as long as the current regulation stays as it is.
And the term "foreign gift" used in the Article pretty much means that once a coin is sent to someone residing in Indonesia as a gift, it loses the foreign status and be subject to Indonesian regulations. Thus a Bitcoin recipient in Indonesia will not be able to legally use it within Indonesian market, limiting its usefulness in the nation.

But there is also absolutely nothing on that official release from BI which stated that Indonesia endorses the legality of bitcoin/cryptocoins. 
I think you jumped the gun here, the exact wording from the [BI statement]( was:


Which translates into:


Which means that using Cryptocoins as a method of payment is **still illegal** in Indonesia, and there is nothing on that statement that preclude future ruling that outright forbids the usage of Cryptocoins in Indonesia.
So it is not even an "indirect declaration of legality", as per what your site claimed. It is just a statement that a certain sphere of usage for Cryptocoins (e.g. methods of payment) is illegal. I will be convinced that our government supports Cryptocoins the moment the government published tax regulations for them.

Hi, I came from the future, apparently dogecoin just did exactly that a couple days ago.
