less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
So basically, once a significant portion of coins have been mined, or the difficulty has been raised such that new blocks are not coming in quickly, each new block will contain the transaction fees and whoever discovers this block gets the fees?
