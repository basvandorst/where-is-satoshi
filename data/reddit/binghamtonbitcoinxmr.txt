blockchain.info is a dangerous wallet for users. Stay away from it. 
There is a rumor they steal btc from users and claims those accounts got hacked (someone also says its blockchain.info staff who make phishing sites everyday), frequently. At least, they are not good guys.
Coinbase is pretty good till now.
Coinbase VS Blockchain.info
Good VS Evil
Blockchain never store your private key, they just steal btc from it and leave nothing on the private key.
Nowadays, only scammers and idiots use blockchain.info

I wouldn't hide things to customers while telling truth to potential investors. If he wanted to hide the truth and improve the business as you said, he should not have told the investors "the discrepancy, and the missing money". He can simply go ahead/refuse without explanation, similar to what he did to us.
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:31:28
So am I

The he wanted to induce people to deposit money&amp;btc to save the business, instead of inducing investors to put money in. That's called "I wanted no blood on my hands"? That's not the way the logic works.

Yes Jed, who started ripple to print tokens himself to sell to idiots.
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:15:13
I don't think he is Jewish. Because Jewish has a reputation of keeping promise.
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:34:56
Thanks for your quick reply.
You said "Once I found the discrepancy, and the missing money... I called the investors and told them about the situation. I wanted no blood on my hands". While people kept depositing money&amp;btc.
Did you think only investors had the blood? or the money that people deposited was not as precious as the money that investors invested? Do you still think your hand was clean?
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:14:37
My question is: Do you think what you did and are doing is moral?
Since, you never said anything while people deposited btc&amp;money into mtgox. You said you made a promise and took 10k btc for that when you left mtgox, although you already thought that's a Ponzi Scheme. 
And now you throw all those bad words into Mtgox's face, after Mark K.'s arrest.

you made me laugh
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:06:55
If he thought about things as you said, he would have told investors "all is ok come on", and in the hope of  "save business and pofit by revenue streams in the future.", by which his business can revive MORE probably.
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:53:35
Lawsuit what? if he did not made that promise for 10k btc.
Now that back then he already had enough evidence to show "the discrepancy, and the missing money"

In fact, the co founder of Coinjar is a infamous thief, which is know to all.
I don't want to directly say those people who still cooperate with that thief are thieves, but...
What shocked me is that such thieves dare to do AMA HERE. i have never seen so effrontery a person.
