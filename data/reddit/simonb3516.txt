No but it’s the same theme he has in marketing and attention, the difference when he talks about that is he gives some practical example normally on what he’s doing or done, where as with crypto he can only talk about it in parr Ellie to that rather than with real examples because he’s not done it. Been following him on and off since late wine library days and he’s been down on crypto - interesting he’s up on blockchain.

Love Gary but seems like he’s plugging his normal routine in a space he’s not 100% up to speed with.

But you can buy other coins as the gateway to alt coins. I think the main issues are both trader manipulation and ultimately mass adoption from consumers. Unless these coins are used in a transactional way (or like ven in a utility way) then prices will be determined by trades rather than use. It’s still hard to pay and buy for things in crypto. When it’s Apple Pay contactless ‘easy’ we will see a stable and growing market.

Good start bro. I do a lot of Shopify sites and there are real upsides too them. 
I presume you purchased the domain through Shopify? Easier but you don’t control the email side of things so a gmail contact address makes it look amateurs. Maybe use a plugin contact form as the contact us page. 
Shipping. You need to define for people what the shipping is. They don’t know without reading the faq where you are. If your eu based it’s fairly easy to work out. Do a flat rate or a few rates based on price baskets. Your win some your loose some €€ but customers will know what there getting into. 
Now the biggest issue is currency. Shopify can’t have multiple currencies easily. There are plenty of plugins that convert using a standard rate but that changes all the time.  So I think you have to pick your target market and stick to that pricing. Focus your marketing efforts. 
The last thing I suggest is put Facebook pixels in your code. Use Facebook advertising on those pixels. If you don’t know google it. Really powerful with a small target customer 
Above all approach the site with a consumer point of view. Look at other sites and all criticism is valid it pick the fixes that make the most impact. In this market trust is probably the biggest. We’re constantly checking wallet codes and waiting for the next hack. So real reviews, lots of info and asking happy customers to share their purchase is probably the best thing to do.

Takes time to do it and you just got to get running  and change as you go. And if you ever find multi currency fixed rate solutions let me know! Biggest issue with Shopify! 
Good luck bro

I think if they think that they should not be in the space. The amount of threads where people have to explain what a hard wallet is show people out money in before researching.
