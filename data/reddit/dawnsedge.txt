You can work around anything with the right api.  But if they hear merchants saying 'we want' or we'll switch to you if you have it 'they'll build it'.  They're very interested in the bitcoin idea (I guess fatter margins than cc?)

CoinJar are pretty reputable and have moved operations to uk so gst no longer applies.  Do ur research though there's igot and bittrade.  All have Australian presence I believe.

API, auto payout.  No risk as coinjar is he hedge.  Ie punch in four dollars, get 4 mBTC, (or whatever exchange is) and have it pay out as four dollars, you can see it in coinjar account straight away.

Yeah challenged net filter in aus.  Calls gov out on so many things.  Wrote for Gizmodo and a bunch of others.  Pretty cool dude.  Great brand too, put pressure on traditional retail in a very good way.  
Good on you for asking.  They're crazy not taking it, it's like the perfect demographic.  Bit of dev work and they could get payout at pegged price in Aud with coinjar with 0.5% fee so it's just a cheaper payment platform.
@_date: 2014-01-18 23:49:29
It's really interesting and challenging.  My gf goes and has a great time but it's definitely dude town in there. Not really sure what the solution is though.  It's still a technical curiosity in some peoples eyes and the tech demographic in general has a bit of a gender imbalance.  I think once it has more mainstream appeal it'll start to even out.

People will flip over a one second delay of one cent so when there's cash involved ya gotta get it right.

Yeah I used to trade to make $$$.  Now I only count my btc.  
Also I was shit at trading.

API, auto payout.  No risk as coinjar is the hedge.  Ie punch in four dollars, get 4 mBTC, (or whatever exchange is) and have it pay out as four dollars, you can see it in coinjar account straight away.  
Also zero confirmations with DCPOS absorbing risk.  They've put a lot of thought into the product and it works really well merchant and consumer side.  
The ATM is a whole different device that has proper bill reader etc but isn't connected to coinjar or DCPOS.

MEDIA RELEASE
26 MARCH 2014
-  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - 
 
Forsyth is Australia’s first Real Estate agency to accept Bitcoin
Forsyth Real Estate, a 115 year old real estate agency on Sydney’s North Shore, is believed to be Australia’s first real estate agency to accept Bitcoin, through a partnership with Bitcoin payments provider CoinJar.
 
The company took on Bitcoin due to the influx of international investors and expats entering the prominent Sydney market, offering another avenue for online payment.  Currently we receive property deposits in the form of personal cheques, bank cheques, direct deposit (electronic funds transfer) or a telegraphic transfer.  Customers can simply select Bitcoin as a payment method and the transaction goes through CoinJar’s payment Gateway .  
 
James Snodgrass, Forsyth Managing Director, says they are strong supporters of the Bitcoin economy as it allows overseas transactions with less fees and exchange rate fluctuations.  “Prior to launching, we had discussions with our financial division who outlined the risks and opportunities of Bitcoin and we were happy with our findings ” said James.
 
Vendors are also able to pay their property advertising with Bitcoin.  Transactions made in Bitcoins still include Goods and Services Tax (GST).  The Bitcoin exchange is calculated in real-time and reconciled by CoinJar so Forsyth receives the exact amount in AUD charges.
 
“We stand behind our 115 year philosophy “client’s best interest about all” and will continue to offer our clients innovative options in this ever evolving world” said James. 
 
ABOUT FORYSTH REAL ESTATE:
 
In 1898, Robert Todd (RT) Forsyth, a young real estate agent, opened a humble wooden office in Willoughby. Seeing a tremendous need for honest, knowledgeable real estate people, RT Forsyth founded his company with a revolutionary philosophy: the clients’ best interest above all. Over the last 115 years, Forsyth has forged a tradition of integrity, exceptional service and customer satisfaction that has become the agency’s hallmark. 
                                                            
About CoinJar
CoinJar is a Melbourne-based bitcoin payments provider, bridging the divide between digital currency and the dollars in your wallet. 
About Bitcoin
Bitcoin, first introduced as a concept in 2008, is a distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that functions without a central authority. Bitcoins are generated by computers performing complex mathematical calculations. They are held in digital “wallets” and can be used to transact for different products and services.

I can appreciate your perception of bitcoins original intention.  with buy ins at fourty, sixty and eighty your speculative purchase at one ninety wasnt a loss so your not behind either.   
Just saying tax is bad doesnt make it bad.  sure government systems are flawed but so is an ellitist attitude that excludes outsider viewpoints.  id say at this point discussions with anarchists, atheists amd Christians arent often an exchange of ideas, so I can't imagine any well thought out response getting any traction but I'll ask you this.  would the crypto liberal anarchist movement have sent enough bitcoin to pay for my hernia operation as a child?  a centralized taxation authority certainly facilitated it.  would crypto anarchists have funded my education?  my student support payments when I was studying?  im fuckin pro tax and the best thing about open source anything is that You dont get to decide who participates.

I was thinking about this.  I'm familiar with the deflationary model and understand the logic.  But on top of this, I'd say a big part of what backs it is us, and our labour.  In the sense that the dollar is 'backed' by coin, bitcoin is 'backed' by our representation of labour, being the money we were willing to invest.  Of course that money ties back to the gold standard, but I don't think in this community that has a lot of weight.    TL;DR - We are the gold.

and when i brought in i got drunk and lost $80 speculating while watching dune because I didn't notice the buy was lower than the sell in mtgox, sold out in shame, and brought in 20 bucks higher.  that felt good to get off my chest.  to the moon right?

drive up the price, sell smart to drop it, buy low again.  Utilising the 10% swing.  Thankfully the market is a lot smarter and people aren't letting it bottom 50%.  Every time there's a twitch.  
EDIT:not sure where that full stop came from.  "letting it bottom 50% every time there's a twitch" is what I meant.  It's weird because I capitalised the E.

@_date: 2013-04-27 13:04:58
I think he's basically calling you out on wearing a hat.
bit coin taxation is about income you report.  probably harder to bust you on it but tax office tech will catch up.  if you suddenly cash 10 000 coin the tax office may ask you about it.  if you keep it virtual and dont own three feraris but have no income you'd probably stay under the radar now.   In terms of companies: I study business law.  There's whole books about tax 'reduction' so im sure they'll find  way to turn an international dexentralised currency to their advantage.
@_date: 2013-04-24 23:08:02
spot on.  I was nerd raging hard watching the numbers.  Partly cause I'm poor and lack the skills to do the same thing.  But I've given up on day trading.  Just gonna be a dragon on my bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-05-01 20:34:35
trying to pick the very bottom or top is basically impossible.  make the call and sit on it.  if it drops lower you can always buy in more and sell original when it gets back to that buy in.

I remember when I bought between 100- 160 and then watched it hover between 60 and 110, feeling like a damn fool.  The decisions I made then cost me more than any market crash did.  The money I made holding left me well ahead despite myself.  Even now.
@_date: 2013-04-27 12:57:25
diversify.  it'd be nuts to put all you money in bc.  however get some, purchase right and if it continues close to average growth you'll be glad you did. its a technology that makes transfer/exchange of wealth a lot easier, could be a game changer and increase in value exponentially.  and its unlikely you'll lose out as there'll always be a demand for anonymous transactions in certain areas.  and  ive got stocks, $$$ and bc.  not that interested in gold, as aus $$ is pretty steady.  
@_date: 2013-04-27 15:20:40
very true.  new would be a confusing place for a new user.  good for watching memes unfold.  and I dont mean photos of 10 guy.  after btce trollbox I feel basically impervious to bullcrap though.  google alerts is great though basically email every time there's a new article.   this place can be a bit of a circle jerk too so it's good to get some outsider analysis so it's not all pats on the back.  to the moon though right?

@_date: 2013-12-23 00:06:37
I remember when GOX was having serious issues and I knew I needed to get my $$ out to be safe.  It was a question of stay in BTC or fiat and by then I knew the fundamentals of BTC, and despite the fact that it looked like the only place to 'cash out' easily was gox i chose to just stay in btc.  It was a gamble but it worked out ok.  Once you've got yourself some BTC you're hard pressed letting go of it.  Alot of chinese might just go cold storage (actual or Bobby-Lee style) and wait it out.

@_date: 2013-05-02 21:48:14
definitely making some assumptions about my reasons for having coin there.  im not saying make a carbon copy of money, just that taxation = legitimacy = stability = functionality.  if it's currency then it's taxable.   its a question of if people declare that income.  bitcoin users declaring their money earnt would create more acceptance of an alternate way to transact.  lets just insist we pay the tax in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-02 06:04:43

but yeah you could say that about most things actually.  They're not bad at tracking transactions and a well secured wallets pretty safe.  no accounting for human stupidity/scams but they've been around for a while.  if you're saying any institution/exchange is a scam till proven ok.. pretty extreme... but fair enough.  if you're generally saying bitcoin in general is a scam I'd say that its a pretty complicated one based on very functional technology and very relevant well developed ideology.

I prescribe karate kicks.  but thats ny answer to everything.  adopt  anyways.   if your partner is accepting his parents nonsense he's a bit under thumb.  I dunno I know very little about parents or babies.

I've put a bit of thought into the potential of another currency.  I think that the whole first to market thing helps bitcoin here.   Alongside this any other market's potential early adopter audience is probably tied up in bitcoin.  You're right though it could go belly up, that's why I've thrown my stake in, not my life savings, and I've got a humble little portfolio of traditional stocks too.  So, stocks, bitcoins and dollars.  I just need to buy some bartering good in case the whole economy collapses.  I even have a bag of bottlecaps in case of nuclear war.

Yeah we noticed profit on goods paid for in fiat covered the supply costs for goods paid for in btc, so we've started leaving btc as is.  We'll hold/use where possible for business costs.

yeah currency is always in essence a way of valuing goods and services and facilitating their exchange.  The economy is just the management of currencies.  So as long as people exchange goods/services there will be both.  I don't understand enough economics to comment about the way it'll look, but I can't see it collapsing without some sort of catastrophic crippling event.  Queue joke about old pop star coming out of retirement.

check out r/bitcoinmarkets.  alot of the guys here arent fond of speculators as its postulated that they are causing volatility.  id say recent sophisticated speculation bots battling it out have caused a lot of issues lately and its tiring everyone out.  if you lurk deep enough you'll usually find your questions answered somewhere however.

except if it got divided you'd still have the same amount of coin.  It'd still be deflationary.

very interested in the site / service.  Just signed up for the beta.  I finally nailed a low cost cash solution between gox and btc-e and then all of a sudden btc-e became the golden child of stability and has been matching gox.  If this tool allows as much cross exchange liquidity as promised I'd be very happy.  Surprised you haven't haf more visibility yet.

and you cant imrpove that it wont by the same logic.  society uses tax to function.   it taxes transactions.  bitcoin is used for transactions.  any capital gains I make I fully intend to declare.  I also freelance and have offered to recieve payment in coin and I fully intend to declare that to.  catch is I'll only pay in bitcoin.  tell me how much support there would be if rhe government accepted bitcoin?    im not saying hand them them the protocol and say take a bite.  just pay taxes on earnings.  I declare cash I earn.  I guess I live in aus so taxes go to welfare, tertiary education etc so maybe I'm less skeptical of taxation

Ok ok ok.   Well I finally decided to make an offline wallet today.  Remember a wallet is just an address and a key, the trick is to generate a wallet, and it's key, completely offline, and then store it in paper form (in my case also USB).  then transfer the bitcoins to that address.  It was a big learning process today, but you can find threads etc that'll help you out.  I'll have a go at explaining my process/
**Useful definitions **
* wallet - your bitcoin money stash
* address - the long numbers that people use to identify destination of coins
* key - encrypted code that looks a lot like an address, that is somehow mathematically congruent with address and authorises the transaction.
**steps (that I used)**
1 - go to bitaddress.org in incognito/private browsing.
2 - save whole website
3- disconnect from the internet
4 - go to paper wallet tab
5 - generate key.
6 - print out, save file in offline location (ie usb)
7 - clear caches
8 - You've got address and key offline you can send bit to.
9 - if you want to see funds going in you can then use blockchain account to set up a 'watch only' address, where you can register your new paper address and just punch in address but not the key.
10 - result - you can see money,  and if you get hacked hackers can see money, but unless they get your paper print out of key they can't authorise the transaction and it sits there.
* I would recommend setting up "watch only" blockchain account so you can see balance, then sending a .01btc test transaction to make sure you didn't eff it up.
* Boom.  Offline paper wallet.   There's probably other ways and if you lose key/fuck up you can lose coins so as they say on r/bitcoin - do some research before you do it.
Pro bitcoiners please let me know if I've missed anything here as I'm purretty serious about not getting e-robbed.
Edit: made it look less like it was written by an old lady.
Edit 2:  I didn't realise i cared this much about formatting.

there's some doozys.  some questions are a bit frustrating sometimes but I get more annoyed when people are jerks about it.  "what is bitcoin?"  - "do some research!"  when a well structured conversation can leave a newbie walking away with an understanding and confidence in the coin that they can spread.    itd be great having a hot tips area though, as we'll be getting more and more.  ie-dont sell if theres a 3% drop or gox lags for 30 seconds etc

aside from buy/sell behavior what else is impacting the value of the coin?

@_date: 2013-04-27 08:38:47
I second that.  I wouldn't buy in if I didnt have some savings etc.  It's great having a stake.  I live in aus so it's not massive here and when I mention I got some everyone acts like I'm basically satoshi.   I read some old posts about people talking about like 30 bucks as being too high and missing the boat etc last year.  seems crazy now but everything is relative I guess.  but thats what bumped me over the line.

its nerve wracking.   I think the strategy is have a reserve that's earmarked to just be part of the overall growth, and a chunk set aside to trade with.  so you have your gamblin money without being scared of missing a big boom.  However I'm just sitting on it atm I've had no trading experience prior to this (clearly).   If what I understand of the potential investment and the finite currency is right then the $100 I could make picking a drop then spike is nothing compares to where it might be if I just set and forget.

I know someone who's bank cut all personal accounts cause business was btc related.  Thankfully he had btc tferred to friends for cash till it was sorted.

yeah two transactions that would have been a couple of bucks higher than actual gox rate.  I escalated it went on about it but they just gave up.  Thankfully there's plenty of other routes.  (plenty? some).

Yeah I got a bit of help when I first came here (plus own research).  so I try to randomly answer a question here and there as it pops up.  Unless it's just "hur dur do I get free bitcoin".
