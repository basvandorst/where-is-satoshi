I read the title as DAE and was quite confused for a second.

Regarding poker... I've heard about people quitting crack.  I've never heard about people quitting poker.

He did use the word "through".  His title is fine.

It was my understanding that there was a maximum number of blocks.  Am I wrong?
@_date: 2013-03-26 18:17:53
I know, those blocks are so *huge* on their frontpage.  Geezus!

It's like when I refer to a "computer instance " as a "box" at work.  Sometimes they're like WTF?!

As a trader, do you think that proprietary trading firms / market markers will start to trade bitcoins in high volume in the near future?

That's pretty much any government.

Jesus, ya'll freaking out.  Simple... don't invest what you can stand to lose.

Just to make sure I understand... when you say they're out, is that because more people are buying coins than selling *and* Coinbase isn't mining enough coins to make up for it?  I'm assuming Coinbase itself mines coins on the side.

The auto-email sounds like a great idea.  Preparing for my eventual demise scares me though.  I feel that by doing so I'm inviting Death to come and take me.

This is what keeps me watching the BTC economy instead of actively participating.  It appears too volatile and its future is uncertain.  My personal interest in BTC is to play online poker in the US.  I don't like the idea that not only am I gambling at the poker table, but cashing in and out to USD is a gamble as well.

I cry evrytim kthxbye.

This scares me a little.  Processing power is only growing.  Will all of the blocks have been mined before this is real possibility?

What is that clip originally from?

It's never too late to use it as a currency.  As an investment, I'm not sure when this ride is going to stop.
