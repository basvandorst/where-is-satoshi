The people buying or selling into the pump are hiding how much they are actually buying or selling. Every exchange does this, China just does it more. When you figure Stamp, Bitfinex, BTC-e, Kracken can do around 1,000,000 BTC volume in a short amount of time it makes you wonder. There are only so many BTC on exchanges. How are they doing millions of BTC in volume again and again.

Wow. 15% away from doing it. Time to open a bigger long. Finally bigger blocks and lower fees. The scaling solution we need to attract big money.

Trump isn't happy with the federal reserve and called them out in an [interview recently](
Trump said he thinks the stock market would be 10,000 points higher if the federal reserve was on their side.
With Trump trying to get the wheels in motion on many things how much old money is finding its way into Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the new standard. These whales keeping a lid on the price is just providing easy ways to get in. Then just think of all that sideline money when the selling stops. Use it to support a higher price.
Less people sell the higher the price goes. Trading goes off exchanges and to Bitmex. Hardly any sell pressure on exchanges. 
Almost to 2020. I feel 2020-2030 kids will have it best. If their parents invest in Bitcoin that is.
World wide a few million more coins to mine. $8800 price. Population going up. Fiat going up.
Who is selling and shorting wants to be rich now. Long and wait is the key.

Has anyone looked into Alameda Research? They have 2 accounts on top of the Bitmex leaderboard 
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:38:37
Ah, so they take the opposite trade and make thousands of Bitcoins. Unless they have other accounts on Bitmex losing thousands of Bitcoins.

The possibility BTC = $5000 and BCH = $2500 soon. 
I never thought it would happen but with the way things are going it just seems so easy.
Then $4500 and $3000

No fools. Will Bitcoin fork soon.
@_date: 2017-04-01 19:54:30
Stick a fork in it. It's done.

Jesus is coming back Sunday and he supports BTC. Buy now or forever be poor.

Damn that means less sell pressure then.
