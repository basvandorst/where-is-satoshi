And the subpoena was on December 6th so either Tether are idiots or completely legit

Additionally, we don't know the result of the subpoena yet either, so its possible that its finally announced sometime this month that its all a fraud. 
But Tether has minted ~1.4 billion of its total supply of ~2.2 billion since the date of the subpoena (~65%) They'd have to be absolute idiots to continue doing so illegally after being subpoenaed by the US gov. Which is possible, just unlikely.
Numbers from cmc:

Bloomberg updated their article to show the correct date. Seems like some planned FUD to initiate a sell off for big players.

No disagreement here, I was just making a joke about the downfall of the US

A bubble lasting 200 years? Are you referring to the United States or Bitcoin's potential

If you want to donate to someone who's on the cutting edge of a new frontier in the biomedical sciences, look into Michael Levin at Tufts University, and his Institute for Regenerative Biology at Tufts.
He's a computer scientist that did his PhD in Developmental Biology at Harvard. He looks for top down mechanisms of control regarding morphology and development that can be used in regenerative medicine. His findings regarding the role of membrane voltage outside the nervous system will rewrite text books in a few years, as well as many other major topics, like mechanisms of biological memory. He does every level of analysis important in a scientific, he doesn't just publish the results of experiments, he develops mathematical models, explores the philosophical significance, pushes new theoretical foundations and promotes new ways to do science. If you want to get a sense of what topics he's interested in, check out his recommended books page in his resources section, or just skim the titles of his publications. 
A real world application: he's shown that cancer, which is often A failure of patterning, can be corrected by modulating the membrane voltage of cancer cells. No genetic interventions or toxic treatments necessary, just some ion channel drugs applied in the right place. 
I've corresponded with him on a few ocassions and I'd be more than happy to assist in the process of dontating to him / the institute of regenerative biology, should you choose to.

My sister just finished an economics degree at a highly liberal college, she thinks bitcoin is the devil. Her only knowledge about it has come from comments by her professors.

Everyone always says cost averaging is the way to go, IMO cost averaging really only works when the price is moving sideways fluctuating around a specific value, or when there are significant drops during the period in which you cost average. 
I have a strong intuition that in this past year there would be far more times where cost averaging netted you less bitcoin than just buying it all at once, no matter what interval you choose. I'm probably wrong, and I plan on doing an analysis at some point to see, but I think you should take all investment advice with a grain of salt on here, especially advice that just gets spouted out by default anytime someone asks about buying bitcoin in times with price runs that are anything but oridinary

They expect a lot because they expect you to be passionate about what you're doing to the point where you'll commit your life to it. And the people that stay working for Tesla despite the conditions are typically the most passionate, otherwise they get burnt out, so it works out. Science/Academia is similar, the video game industry is definitely like that, as are many other industries,

That aspect of the argument was probably taken for granted in this discussion. If you ask an economist why money works in the real world and they want to give a real answer, it would be the value of the entity (government, economy, etc) backing it, even if technically the entity backing it is actually the collective belief in the the myth of money, the answer given would be more concrete

I should have clarified the time frame I was speaking about, but I thought it was fairly apparent that wikileaks hasn't been specifically targeting Hillary Clinton and the DNC throughout the entirety of it's existence. 
I have no issue with him publishing the information about the DNC / Hillary Clinton. But his interaction with the media, and how he built up the situation to make it much more extreme than it was in reality, screamed political bias from my perspective. Granted, that is my perspective, which is in itself biased.

Where are their actions against the corrupt politicians currently in the White House? If they were all about American values, they would be on top of everything the trump administration does. Wikileaks was anti-Hillary, not anti-corruption

Most people alive today would reject that communism is a good way to structure a society, but 99% of those people probably haven't read the communist manifesto. Their opinions are based on observable evidence that communism failed, and probably a bit of biased information. 
No one has time to read everything they have an opinion on. Instead, for at least some of our opinions (I would argue most) we have trusted sources that we rely on for their opinions, and we assume they've read up on the necessary literature to understand the nature of whatever it is. 
My point is, dissing people for rejecting an idea before reading the foundational literature that set loose that idea is foolish, because we all do that in some way or another without realizing it.
