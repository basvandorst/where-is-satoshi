Since we were commenting on Gavin's story I interpreted "Against" strictly as against Gavin's 20MB proposal.

Exchanges were already done and posted 8 days ago here: 
Tons of exchanges have not yet commented, biggest examples being Bitstamp and BitFinex.

Color me surprised.
8chan has the same problems compounded and has accepted Bitcoin donations exclusively for months, so much so that [I link to this page on every board index and thread](
It's actually gone quite well, we've received thousands of US$ in BTC and in my country Philippines the conversion is painless OTC or even at sarisari stores with coins.ph. The only problem is lack of education among donors.

He didn't say anything about what USG does or doesn't do. China being wrong about something doesn't make the US right, it's not a ying yang.

If you have Satoshi's GPG private key or access to his Bitcoins, for sure.
If not you're just another impostor no one cares about.

My point is I got a hearty laugh over you wasting 14 hours on writing a guide just to direct people to a $15 get rich quick scheme that will probably sell less than 10 copies, and the comedy gold of upvoting your ad mindlessly made a funny post.
People who make $120k/year don't bother with such small time scams, because their 14 hours is worth more than what you spent it on.

Not every citizen of the US lives in the US.
@_date: 2015-07-01 14:09:08
Hahaha, oh wow. You seriously wrote this guide just to try to sell people your get rich quick scheme?
Everyone upvoting this is supporting this scammer's SEO effort.
"Here's how I generate $5,234/m using Bitcoin."
I assume you generate that from sales of your book?
Edit: [Post with archives, he has since removed it after multiple people brought it up.](

I'm also an expat. I live on the other wide of the world from the US. I have no driver's license and am not booking a flight to get one to follow this stupid rule.

And if you live outside the country ?

Wouldn't work at all. It's trivial to search the blockchain for addresses containing certain strings, and if there are multiple results it's simple to narrow it down by using amounts, dates and times, and so on.
