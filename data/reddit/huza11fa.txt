I think I might have to wait another 12h or more. Will update once it gets confirmed.

After around 3 days it got confirmed. The miners are back on BTC, blocks are being mined every ~10 mins. :P (Y)
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:26:33
No confirmations till now. Almost 24h.

It's infuriating. My exchange also doesn't give custom fee option. I had to pay 0.001 BTC (~$7) as fees yet so much delay.
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:17:54
paid $7 as fees 12 hours ago. No confirmations. -.- 
tx id : 
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:17:02
Yeah, I figure this is the cause for the delays.
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:31:45
Yeah and looks like there is nothing I can do but wait. :/

Hahaha you are so paranoid. What is super fishy about this? I have given the tx id to prove my concern. I have waited more than 12h and will wait even more. I am not pushing some "propoganda" and  I am not the "same person" you are imagining over and over, You are seeing constant posts like this from people because they are going through these problems. No need to make a scene out of everything. ✌

You see, you are the one who brought up this. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:27:07
how does it matter? month or so ago I didn't pay the fees I paid today. So it's all relative. The delay is being caused by less hashing power as most people understand. It has nothing to do with the price of BTC.

Wow. Hope everything is back to normal soon. I remember paying ~25 cents as fees a month or so ago.
