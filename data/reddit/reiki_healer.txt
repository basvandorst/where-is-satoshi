Thank you very much! Just triple checking.

The only difference I see is every time we use BTC as currency, we're encouraging those sellers and other sellers to use BTC over other forms of currency, which is the end goal and where at least what I see the true value of BTC truly lies. So every time we spend BTC over another currency form we're supporting converting currency to BTC.
EDIT: so for me personally, if given the option to use USD or BTC on a purchase, I think the wise choice would be to spend that amount of USD on more bitcoin, and then purchase with bitcoin over USD.

This is so anecdotal, but my cousin is super into investing, and has been since he was crazy young. I want to say 12.
Some kids get into dinosaurs, some get into saving puppies, some get into dance, video games, what have you.
It's only logical that some get into investments, and some got into learning about bitcoin.
I'd hear my kid out at the age of 13.

It's possible that I've just missed them, but I haven't really seen any comments or posts harping on about specifically SPENDING bitcoin. I thought the idea was to get us all using bitcoin instead of USD, Euros, etc.
I thought HODL meant just once you buy in, don't SELL. I could be wrong. Someone please correct me if so.

I'm a total newbie to clarify, lol, but I think so! At least SPEDN with BTC over USD (or whatever currency you use where you're from; I'm American) whenever possible.

I am so sorry I am so new to this and I'm sure you guys have been dealing with all us newcomers recently but...
I literally just bought $50 of BTC via Coinbase (meaning I spent $50, so obviously I don't have an actual bitcoin, just whatever percentage 50 of 9500 is, and I understand they won't actually show up in my wallet for like 8 days, 10 according to this post). I assume the "keys" mean the number or whatever behind the bitcoin, those things people have on their hard drives, etc.
Through coinbase, do you know if I have a way of retrieving this number? Again, sorry for being so new and totally not understanding a lot of this.

Woot woot go newcomers! I'm amazed at how much I'm loving learning about all of this!

Nor me. Honestly everyone's been pretty cool with explaining stuff. Obviously if I had a question I read before posting, and so far it's all been answered (so no need to post). I kind of got the vibe here that all the ol timers were more than happy to bring us on board. Isn't that the point? That we transfer everything to bitcoin?
If there've been mean comments I'm glad I missed them!

Yesssss that's how I feel!!
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:18:46
I'm just now getting in and I don't feel bad at all!
A lot of people were a lot better informed and smarter than me, but that kinda happens every day. It's all good man, more power to 'em.
I'll take whatever piece I can manage to afford. Doesn't really help that I'm just now getting into this right before Christmas, but I'll invest what I can when I can. If it goes up to 15k I'll keep buying, so long as it keeps climbing =).
Don't kick past you for not knowing better, help out future you by knowing better now!

meh, don't. I don't have any experience investing really at all. I've just spent my whole life working =). A couple friends and my brother convinced me to buy in a bit. I spent $50. I'll probably spend more here and there and just see what happens. As long as no one's throwing money they can't afford to lose at it, worst case scenario it's a learning opportunity.
