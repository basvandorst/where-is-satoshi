That's not the only reason. Go back and listed to Jerome Powell discuss the details. They see the current low adoption as a low threat, and Facebook allowed reach to mass adoption overnight. That's very scary to the establishment that uses monetary policy to control the markets.

Bitcoin regulation is bigger than bitcoin. They will open the door with BTC and then crypto 3.0/PoS (Tezos, ETH 2.0, Cardano, etc.) can and will be all the things BTC can't be, due to nature of POW. 
The regulators are taking all this into account to "future proof" blockchain as a whole. That's why I made the statement earlier about not getting too aggressive too quickly, so the regulators can wrap their heads around it, before they have to wrap their hands around it.

How many Americans can log into their 401K account and buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-01 21:22:40
I guess the correct answer depends on what happens in the future. You may not get another chance to buy at a lower price, or you might. 
If it were me, I'd lock in now.

Institutional on-ramp and solved custody issues.

New York just issued a license to Fidelity. That's the biggest fiat on ramp in existence. Just happened.
@_date: 2019-11-20 02:47:57
I'm struggling with the idea that regulators will allow crypto into qualifying accounts (401k, IRA, etc.). Also, Fidelity has stated in their disclosures their current plans are institutional only. E-Trade and TD Ameritrade are both working towards licenses for personal trading accounts. 
You are right this will take time to play out, and personally, I hope none of the companies get too aggressive and scare the regulators. I don't want to see the Libra effect all over again.

I've heard the argument that Tether pumped BTC. I don't get it, the market caps are not even close. That would be like trying to pump a hot air balloon with your lungs.

ETF would allow people to have exposure to holding crypto, without holding crypto. Like GLD for gold.

There I fixed that for you
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:17:16
I didn't say that. It will bring more capital, though. Whether or not that is better is yet to be determined.

How can you not compare bitcoin to risk off assets? 


Do you think it's coincidence that BTC rose from $3.5k to $11k during the time the 10 year treasury went from 2.5% yield to 1.46%, then BTC dropped to our current range when the yield reversed back to \~1.8 - 1.7%?

BTC is a financial asset that has correlations with other financial assets. To me, it's like the 10 yr treasury of our time, a place to go when all else fails. 
This morning we had the worst jobs data since May. The market reacted with a bad news is good news \[the Fed will save us\], and 10 year yields bounced off yesterday's bad news of no trade deal (a-whole-nother bag of dicks if you ask me). 
So seeing BTC bounce and pull back as the other financial assets stabilized is no big deal. Just another trading day. When in doubt, zoom out. Peace

Which part? Do you own/trade any other financial assets?

The market has a way of testing weak longs. Sorry it didn't work out for you.
