There will be guys who can gauge sentiment and navigate around latest developments direct from source, taking into account things like 'reading between the lines' - weighting the news on the reputation or influence of said source &amp; timeline in respect to release of it.
then there is guys who wait for it to be spelled out crystal clear, and will not like to take a chance on what they feel is 'unfounded' rumours posted to drive market in a particular direction. 
consistently in this past weeks developments on chinese side you can get a good idea 2-48 hours before any sort of large movement at all from QQ groups, weibo feeds and doing own background check, for instance P2P lending whitepaper, statements of exchange CEO's, regulatory departments forecasts, and R&amp;D topics (yes even if they do not specifically mention the word bitcoin) Forums (such as First Financial conference) and upcoming Wudaokou Salon talk in coming days. It's only when it's intepreted or misintepreted , and essentially spoonfed on popular western channels into 'mainstream' that price begins making real up or down trends. when it hits yahoo news and businessinsider, and copy pasted all across the web many only seem to take notice. With baidu news for instance it dropped for nearly 3 hours until western media picked up on it, somebody posted here and circlejerk began. It was a strange case of losing out for reacting to info too quickly if you sold impatiently since market was seemingly reacting in opposite way. simple strategy to wait for it to trickle down and absorb like a sponge
This is one of those cases, for now people want to see english translation on wsj with a screenshot and a direct link to peoples bank of china statement specifically writing that bitcoin is legal, and recharge is added- reddit frontpage submissions before they intepret bearish, that's not happening. it's very clear indication exactly as OP states that this is 'pouring cold water' on bitcoin, not 'combination punches' or 'cutting off at arteries' as some has suggest. and yes, there had been plenty of bold claims such as the one you quoted. For this reason it *is* very bullish in comparison to the bearish outlook some had been touting.
Downvotes or upvotes do not matter, or opinions only whether you made correct decision on trading, proof is in the profit.

This is clear positive news no doubt. &amp; exactly what any sharp traders had hypothesized in mid dec. some people may interpret as a green light, others just see as 'not a red light' "wait and see" like congress
some people will be looking for clear black and white letters to be more comfortable, unfamiliar with differences in china. maybe they will want to see the headline "bitcoin legal" on headline of the document.
market will slowly absorb this news and I expect a gradual growth. they do not want a crazy hype.
A conference is on 29th too,

this was from OKCoin statement after meeting, I think it's plain to see the real problem is crazy hype, hacks, fraud ludicrous speculation  but there is a positive sentiment on bitcoin itself. document shown above affirms that they want to keep in touch with latest financial innovation.
