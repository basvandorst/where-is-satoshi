I'm on mobile right now. What's on the sidebar? Maybe this should be there.

And a lot of people took a gamble and lost too, which is also pretty obvious in hindsight, and probably agreed with common foresight at the time.

Very much agree

 Of course, we can only guess... But deep down he probably knows that (in spite of what he may say out loud or even tell himself) he's not really a self made man, having been [given millions]( from his father; that all the women he's ever had/ married quite possibly were in it for money, not for the guy himself; he's had an [odd relationship with his father]( he got into Wharton [by family connections]( rather than by merit...
Basically being rich and powerful doesn't necessarily mean you feel like you really deserve your accomplishments, deep down you'd know this and doubt yourself so much you may tend to overcompensate... I mean, be the greatest overcompensator ever...

Lol yeah that would be standard Brazilian pronunciation. Fit = feetchee for example.
You gotta realize it works both ways though. Think of Brad Pitt saying "Gorlami" in Inglorious Bastards...

So if you follow that line of reasoning to the extreme, you can't accept any news... Or any information for that matter, since it's all biased, right?
Just have to make up whatever perspective of reality you'd like, right?
And now with the Internet and social media you just slide into whatever bubble fits that most comfortably for you... While at the same time down voting dissenting opinions from the comfort of your toilet seat.
Can you see how the above leads to conflicts on smaller and larger scales?
It reminds of the alleged old Chinese curse "may you live in interesting times". Times feel way too interesting now.

Worse than consuming. People are spreading whatever (mis)information they *feel* fits their worldview. And not realizing they're underwriting it as they do so. And it's way too easy to spread stuff, and that can do lots of harm.

Seems to me that's the same sort of math that pyramid schemes or multi level marketing loves though. By this reasoning every "node" is at the center of an independent network and exponentially, very quickly the numbers add up to more people than exist. It seems to me in fact most networks would have huge overlaps and be limited in reach. Also, not every action or person creates huge ripples or barely any at all, and some people create much stronger waves...
I think it may *feel* good to think everyone is such a special unique important snowflake in the center of a potentially huge network, but I don't think that maps onto reality.
Another factor to consider is that especially with social networks there are algorithms limiting or potentializing the reach of each "node".
