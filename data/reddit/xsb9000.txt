Apparently, half of that goes to real humans and the other half goes to game monsters. Crazy.

I tried the *strings* linux command and I can see some bitcoin addresses. I checked using a blockchain explorer and these addresses have outputs to the one that is listed in stealmywallet.com
    $ strings wallet.dat | grep ^name\"1
    name"1GFTcuAozvC5cSLEeBuUQQtgeXjaBbpiFs
    name"1DgiXekCf6fT2Xj7uYFr5GgGRopNm1hdjP
Does anyone know why I am able to see this in an encrypted wallet?

Blockchain fees are calculated by tx size (literally how many bytes the transaction uses, this is why it's cheap to make big payments and expensive to make micro-payments. Lightning fees are calculated based on value instead, the more satoshis you move the more fees you pay. This is why you can pay millisatoshis for free but also why big payments are expensive. The fact that Blockchain and LN have different fee calculation mechanisms will create a scenario in which some transactions are better done on Lightning and others are better done on the blockchain. Also, once we have schnorr and taproot, the blockchain will enable use cases that can't be implemented in Lightning, like private smart contracts with hidden if/else paths. LN uses the blockchain but can't replace it.
