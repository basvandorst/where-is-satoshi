I guess they can see the writing on the wall that their legacy bank system is on its last legs and would like to be ready for what comes next.

why not 256MB. 51%+ of miners will not build on a too-big block if they think other miners wont either. And if we get a few really big stupid blocks in while miners get their shit together so what.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:51:56
does this mean we can see a &gt;1MB block and have it accepted in the main chain anytime soon?

good, do it, force Bitcoin to adapt or die.

an obscure counting system that is not used anywhere by anyone. if he wanted to be relevant he could have been promoting base 60 sumerian number system at least which is still used on some things like clocks and and circle degrees.

other miners could decide to ignore the 10Gb block, and orphan it if they had enough hashpower to collude on orphaning stupidly large blocks for the sake of the network.

dont worry. if this sub's vision of bitcoin doesnt scale to what the world needs some other fork will. if it means bitcoin dies and some altcoin or forked-bitcoin-blockchain client takes over, so be it. software will be published, users will run it and the marketplace will decide what lives and what dies. my coins are being held long term and so I dont particularly care what fork of the bitcoin blockchain emerges with the most hashpower and/or user base ... my coins should be spendable on whatever wins ... however if bitcoin completely fails and some altcoin has to take over, well i guess my holdings would become worthless but the world will be improved for the new scalable cryptocoin that people can use.

bitcoin at the point of sale wont be the main use case for it for quite a while (probably years/decades) ... right now some of the the big deals are simply being able to transact in the face of financial blockades, remitting around capital controls, and saving outside of central bank inflationary policies.
