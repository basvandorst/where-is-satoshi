I see, I really hope tether isn't super greedy because they truly are solving a current problem with Cryptos it would be nice to see other currency be backed 1:1

Ever heard of [diversification](

Didn't know there was such thing as a professional technical analysis reader.

It's not diversification if all your funds are allocated in the tech sector.

Right so they issue tether for 0$?

So where does this pumped tether go to? I thought in order to get tether you had to buy it for 1$ from there its yours and tether has nothing to do with it... 
I personally like tether it is a good entry and exit point for cryptos
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:57:34
I just don't see the benefit of themselves issuing out tethers for 0$...

How to invest in every bubble...

The only way your scenario works out is 
A. Tether sells coin less than $1 and therefore they lose money.
B. Tether themselves goes to exchange and buy bitcoin  and not having the money to back the tether in which they just purchased the bitcoin...
I don't see either option happening unless they're extremely greedy.  Their fees are already ridiculous have you ever tried transferring tether from exchanges I'm sure they're making a nice profit off that alone.

how can Company A create tether?  You mean buy tether?
