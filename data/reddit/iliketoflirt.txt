Well, part of a good password is that it's not used anywhere else.

Yeah, sorry but even in the business world it's a lot of money. Maybe not for the big multinationals, but most businesses can only dream of that amount of cash.

Same here. I don't have the money to risk it at the current price, but if it crashes, I have enough faith in them that they'll go up in price once more.

Some guy earlier explained that there's a limit in China of how much of their currency they can convert to USD. And that you have to go through a lot of hoops for it. This way, they can convert a lot and easily, even if they take a big loss.
Not saying that it is happening, but it is not that far fetched really.

Nopes. You'd still be wishing you waited half a day and bought more of them at $500 instead.

Not as hard as I kicked myself for not bothering with bitcoin back in early 2009. I could have been a multi millionaire for a few hundred bucks. :(
But, right now I can't spare $400 to maybe get a big payoff in 3 years.

I've been hearing a lot of bitcoin fans saying that the price will be 100k+ in # years. Some people have a lot of faith in them. Personally, I don't have the money to have enough faith in them.

Put in a bit of money each month to get higher return (hopefully).
But yeah, it's not the jackpot it used to be.

True enough. I did open them all, but most are right out for being a completely different kind of game. I did a password request for lords of lords, as that's the only possibility in that list (though the name is completely unfamiliar), but got nothing from it.
I did use to play minethings, but don't even remember what name I used.

But after the fact, you do know. When you buy at 900, they go down to 500 half a day later, to rise to 5k a month from then, you won't be wishing you bought 10 more coins at 900, but rather 18 more coins at 500.

I wish I was the owner of that wallet. Daaamn.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:07:41
Did it go from $30 to $15 in half a day? If so, I'm pretty sure people that still have those coins are wishing they had waited that half day and bought twice as many instead. Though their regret for that is obviously mitigated by it already being a great investment. Still, essentially you're saying "people don't wish for their bitcoins to be twice as valuable"

Nopes, first time I'm asking.
And it's none of those. The one I'm looking for is text-based, so no fancy graphics. Just uses some sprite models for to depict what stuff looks like. And it was rpg (sword and sorcery, and I think elves/dwarves/undeath and the like).
Thanks for checking, though.

Right now bitcoin still seems to act a bit as stock. Many people don't buy it to use on goods, but rather to make a big profit. It will need to be much more widely accepted by shops, specially the big ones.
Right now it's a trend, not a household name.
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:34:27
I know I can buy fractions, but I'm not really comfortable losing anything. They're not cheap on welfare. :p
Right now I'm watching the trend and hope it soon dips a bit so I am more comfortable buying some.

To me it sounds like the problem is not (just) with the scammer, as you'll always risk having scammers on such sites, but rather with localbitcoins taking the side of the scammer.
If you can't trust them to act the right way when things go wrong, the risk increases severely.

I've signed up for thousands of games, most have been binned. :p
But, I found out I didn't set any email for it at all, so just an old username and simple password. But no stash of coins there, not that I expected it. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:12:48
Not saying you should beat yourself up over it. Just correcting the notion that when the price increases you'd wish you'd bought more at the then high.
But, here's to hoping in time the ones that bought it at 900 won't mind as much.

Can't even verify tier 1, as they insist my phone number is invalid.
Edit: Figured it out. To other Dutchies, take out the first 0 in your area code (at least if your area code is 4 digits)
