The omens are clear, time for a crypto crusade.
DEUS VULT!

I've seen the transaction that corresponds to this before, however I never saved it. (I want to show it to people who are interessted in Bitcoin and alts but have no clue whatsoever, I find it a 'fun' example of showing the transparency of the blockchain)
So my question, which redditor will save me and provide the tx?

I dont fully disagree with you, however is the impact of a method for accessing data that much different from storing data (that also makes it easier to access)?

Having heard about and being familiar are two different things imho. The latter being knowing how to use it (and perhaps knowing how it somewhat works?) Hence the ButCoin part ;)
The capital gains tax actually changed a bit laat/this year. First 25k are free, the next 50k (so up to 75k) you pay 0.86% then up to 975k 1.38% and anything above 1.62%

Aparrently there is one on the Hightech Campus (first place where I wouldve expected one, didn't know)
But still, 12 in Amsterdam I would've at least expected one in the centre/university grounds of Eindhoven

same one as on the map ;)

You are most definately obliged to pay payroll tax if (and only if) day trading is (and can be proven to be) your livelyhood.
The majority of our populace has heard of Rwanda and knows what it is, this doesn't imply it is familiar with Rwandese culture.
The point you raise about the banking system is indeed valid and immediatly something that contrasts what you are saying. I would at the very least consider knowing how to transact crypto on a day to day basis is the "least" requirements of being "familiar". And I am 100% certain that number is not even in the same order of magnitude as 74%

What a load of crap, myself being from the Netherlands I call this post BS.
No cryptocurrency taxes? There are no specific crypto taxes as of yet. However, you're still obliged to pay capital-tax. If you're making a living as a day trader you'll still have to pay "loonsbelasting" (google translate tells me payroll tax, which seems a Dunglish term to me but sure ;) )
Amsterdam currently has 12 crypto ATMs? I wouldn't have a clue as I don't live near Amsterdam. I would however expected to have come across a few by now in Eindhoven.
Bitcoin embassy? Like the fuck? How is this supposed to be anything significant? It is not as if it is an actual embassy. My guesstimate was confirmed with a quick google search, it is a freakin' bar/rentable space. Nothing to see here folks.
Now for the final nail in the coffin, 74% of the Dutch populace is "familiar" with Bitcoin? I consider myself and those around me reasonably well educated (I mean most go to university for a reason I suppose) and at least a couple of them are into tech. A year ago none I spoke to knew what Bitcoin even was, let alone be "familiar" with it, fast forward to last December and friends/family started to talk about this BotCoin? or BatCoin? And eventually started asking me about this shit as they knew I was invested/interested. Even today I can count the number of people who are familiar with BitCoin on one hand, let alone those who are familiarized with using Bitcoin or who have even the slightest idea what SegWit or LN is! At most 74% of the Dutch have heard about ButCoin, it was ButCoin amiright?

Even if these numbers are accurate Bitcoin still "loses". According to this table the Banking system costs about 3 orders of magnitude more and consumes about 3 orders of magnitude more.
Well, Bitcoin has a volume at the 10^9 order of magnitude (4 billion usd). Now lets look at banks, iirc SWIFT handles a daily traffic of approx 5 trillion USD (will add source later, currently on phone) this puts just SWIFT (which is not the entire banking system) in an order of 10^12. Well look at that, 3 orders of magnitude difference!
In the most optimistic view BTC can be seem as on par with the Banking System (according to this table and assuming that the Banking System is only SWIFT, which it is not)
As much as I like and support crypto, lets not start to misinform everyone by posting skewed data that favors crypto.

Yeah in theory it can operate on low energy usage (1 watt is a bit low, at least a 100. Which is still neglegible)
However, this is in theory. Instead of using Energy I'd rather use hashrate (and this is inherently linked to energy usage). If the price scales so will the network hashrate. This goes both ways.
Prices go up? More people will be inclined to mine and some actually will, adding to the hashrate/energy bill.
Prices go down? Some miners will be forced to turn off their rigs if theyre mining at a loss. Especially for extended periods.
However I never said anything about price. It is about traffic. However if there is a wider adoption it is likely to affect the price in a positive way. Increasing the incentive to mine, increasing the hashrate, increasing the energy consumption. Im not stating that theyre mapped 1:1 but there most definately IS a long term relation.
With the numbers in the table BTC is not more efficient than the Banking System. Period.
