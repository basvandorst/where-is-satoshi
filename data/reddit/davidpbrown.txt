or rot for short.
Similar to the reasons that most companies don't last even a generation in time. Those that do, tend to be propped up by Government while they get gross on profit and the fat of other people's work. Banks; media; etc, all need a splash of cold reality thrown at them.

For a while, perhaps. The whole point of cryptocurrency is to shake off the liability that is big centralized power and control. Visa is one of the most centralized power and control tools, used to limit the normal.. fairly at one with regulation then. Visa is not a place to expect innovation to come from.. otherwise they'd have done e-money before now. Near monopolies are like Governments - they don't need to innovate.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:43:19
I hope not but perhaps too much to hope for that a corrupt and rotten organization like Visa would help support them. Visa of course just a tool for other interests that seem only to want to break economies.
Hopefully sense will prevail and they'll understand the opportunity to stimulate economy with spending.

Regulation killing innovation.. sounds like a good fit with the normal that Visa is more likely to represent. I see no reason to credit them with motives at odds with their actions.

A ledger is simply a unique reference. There can be many reference points.


Why?.. So long as the reference is reliable, it doesn't matter where it is.
If you're thinking only about money, then you are missing the point. There can be many currencies and there can be many asset registers. If it goes mainstream, the detail will be obscured anyway. It seems devs and early investors want to see BTC at $100,000+ on the back of their own greed rather than the reality.

If there can be fluid movement between blockchains, then why would one blockchain dominant to the point that one coin is that much?
Certain unique technology might see that rise.. maidsafe.net for example but blockchains like BTC are not unique.. the cost of mining will encourage alternatives before it ever reaches $1,000,000.

Perhaps because in a crypto-marketplace, you would not be looking at big business that can absorb such events. Escrow might aid small one to one interactions.. big business there but with a slight change of focus and position relative to who is selling.
Bitcoin and blockchains act in place of third party authority but they cannot bridge the gap into the real world.. so, you're right the same issues exist as ever did.

What would be interesting to know, is when anyone at MtGox would have been able to see there was a problem. That is when the first divergence occurred. At first sight, it seems that they must have known for a good long while, before events forced the issue.

To sponsor him, you'd be gifting him a similar amount of money as BTC -?obivously. If you've got BTC to spare, then there are as many other ends to spend it on as ever; RoS perhaps isn't top of the list of priorities for anyone considering where to spend their wealth.

I wonder how much merchants are dumping the BTC they receive. It is to be expected that they will prefer fiat for a while before they are confident of holding Bitcoins themselves.

He's got a lawsuit going, so good luck to him. 
Perhaps Paypal is scared because they know they don't have a business model than could compete 1:1 with bitcoin.
A good business should not need to kneecap the opposition, doing so makes them look weak and it's probably unlawfal for being spitefully selective. Law will have what is better for society widely in mind, not just the one business.
Paypal would do better developing bitcoin services and recognising its potential to be useful.

Bitcoin is not as limited as ye olde fiat, it doesn't just have one function; it is a protocol.
For some Bitcoin will be a merchant transfer system, beating down credit cards; for others it will be a place to retain wealth; for many other later on it'll be a way to manage arbitration and derivatives.
As for being a store of wealth, it's inevitable that in time it'll find greater stability; even fiat has had moments of what you would cast as volitility but it's not prevented communities from continuing to use it.
The point about Bitcoin, is the same as the point about many new technologies; it doesn't matter what it is to you, it's not for you to project your expectations of how others must use it. Bitcoin has a lot of promise and if all it does is replace the likes of money transfer services and challenge ye olde world banking to perform efficiently and for the consumer, then that will be useful.

While true, that doesn't necessarily suggest BTC obviously. Not that I'm suggesting simple copy-coins and even real Bitcoin1.0 alt-coins will necessarily suceed, but certainly Bitcoin2.0 and other crypto efforts will likely be followed having been encouraged and spawned by these demand pressures. Indeed it would be an odd liability, if there was only one flavour providing for all.

If you divide total BTC by the number of people you expect might use Bitcoin and multiply by average wealth put to buying into Bitcoin, then you get a sense of the potential long term price.. and even with a pessimistic uber conservative guessing, that is quite encouraging.

@_date: 2014-01-19 22:29:51
As dskloet's noted, yes it's possible. The wallet is essentailly just the collection private keys for the addresses in the wallet. So, running and/or transfering copies of the same information in different software is quite possible, though potentially they might look to the same blockchain folder which could cause r/w confusions if they are both running.
Just to note: running two copies in parrallel, might risk any wallet that is used creating new addresses. Which is fine, if you don't use the other but if you did use both wallets, then I wonder that might lead to different balances for the wallet and that would then be hard to fix to a wallet that included all addresses that contained the shrapnel from having sent coins out - I'd expect new addresses are not created from only receiving coins to existing addresses.

That isn't volatility, that a currency failing. I was remarking on the history of the US dollar, early 20C and before.
Bitcoin is electronic gold. It's perhaps easier to consider it as the equivalent to cash rather than in other forms.
You're thinking is struggling to compare bitcoin to controlled fiat but the points about tax, miss the point. There is nothing prohibiting tax being paid with Bitcoin other than a willingness for Government to accept that. It's early days; so, no surprise that isn't possible at the moment, but if Government accepts cash and credit payments, why not Bitcoin.
Also, Bitcoin does not need "government currencies" or any other currency; Bitcoin can act as a payment transfer system, faster and cheaper than existing technologies but it could also stand alone, if a people wanted that. You can't expect to fairly critique Bitcoin for not being now everything it will be in the future. It's new; so, still finding stability for example but that doesn't negate it's potential.
Just because you can't imagine Bitcoin replacing a currency doesn't suggest that might not happen later. First though it will act as a payment transfer system between currencies, then later it will find stability and tension between buyers and sellers and act better as a store of wealth and as mature currency. In parrallel with that other capability will arise from the protocol allowing banking functions beyond what is possible with fiat.
@_date: 2014-01-20 16:23:15

Yes, that was deliberate.. one step at a time. It's quite likely even that different coins for different purposes or causes might spring up. If doge can inspire a coin for a short while, then anything can. I'd expect the green issue at least to leverage PPC and others, ones that do something for less energy than BTC requires.
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:51:14
The 'problem' is that it doesn't allow those who fudged up the economy to interfere and control what Bitcoin is; but that's a feature not a bug. If you know anything of economics, you should welcome what Bitcoin does for the transfer of power to people and away from central authority. The world has a liberal bias; the existing power and wealth has a conservative bias: change is good.
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:27:50
Your previous is predicated on the thought that 'institutions currently in power' would win the arguement that there was a need to protect consumers from change and what is good.


That is not accurate. There is no difference between the two. There is not opportunity for selfish to win legal arguement; the law is predicated on a basic optimization of action.


Yes.. and that's the basis of the law.
So, then your suggesting your previous is at odds with that, since inhibiting bitcoin and promoting the stupidity of current power and wealth is indefensible in the long run. Even if you leveraged the risk of discontinuity in a fragil economy, it wouldn't stand what is properly better for the society in the short; medium; or long term. The fallacy of avoiding negative feedback at all costs, only perpetuates and amplifies the inevitable correction back to reality.


and there then is your error. You are arguing as if businesses can call on the same freedom as individuals but they cannot properly do that.
Understanding why businesses are limited relative to individuals, follows principally from experience - a society experiences the reality of the corrupting nature of power and wealth; the gravity of those can enable actions by business that are not in the interests of others and the do go exactly against what you have acknowledged is the spirit of liberty - namely that "True liberty is the ability to live your life how you desire, *so long as you aren't causing harm to others*." Businesses flexing their muscle against individuals, is not a fair fight and they then should not be allowed freedom to limit other markets - or where they are dominate, dictate what is allowed. *If* there are a large number of alternates, then that mitigates the risk because the stupid business will suffer; where there are not a large number of alternates, the stupid business can get away with murder.. unless resisted when there is that opportunity.

PayPal is (yet again) behaving as bully and resisting change. Businesses are not individuals, are should not be afforded the same luxuries that sheild them from external threats and normal change that is widely good for society. Paypal is in a dominant position in the same way that Visa is, they force their will because they can, not because it's justified. Selfish behaviour like that should not stand and the law should support the underdog. Paypal should not fear Bitcoin unless it cannot compete, in which case it should step aside and stop being redundant.

Resisting the tendancy to monopoly decisions from big business is impt. Allowing big power and wealth to leverage their position is the lazy option they would prefer people take. They do want they want because there is no resistance, until there is.
Obviously, prefer bitcoin freindly services but don't neglect to critique the selfish behaviour of those like paypal and visa making life difficult beyond what is reasonable. The law stands as a defence against such behaviour because it is not constructive and in the better interests of society widely; rolling over and allowing them to abuse whoever they want just so they can make more money, is neglegent where there is an option to object.

I suspect each big push adds an order of magnitude. Perhaps there were 200 in 2011; 2,000 in 2012; 20,000 in 2013; and now perhaps 200,000 with another push I'd expect over later summer into 10's of millions and then perhaps next year it'll go large in some areas and be catchup in others; similar to internet rollout. Regardless how good new tech is, it takes a while for reality to adjust from the normal that it's used to.
Alt-coins then are a step back from that above and split across those. Perhaps Bitcoin2.0 meta coins another step.

If the car is party to the consensus that suggests the blockchain does represent definitively the ownership of that car, then so long as is can see the network it can confirm who it's owner is.
The whole root of Bitcoin is being able to have confidence in what the Blockchain suggests. The Blockchain keeps a unique log of which address owns each coin at any particular time. That confidence follows from the cryptographic nature of Bitcoin and you can look into those basics yourself. The Blockchain is the third-party authority - it's just not possible for people to realistically manipulate that, which is partly why it's so appealing.
Whether it's money or assets, having third-party interests manipulate those markets for their benefits not ours, is what creates economic and financial crisis. A robust system pushes back with negative feedback and other systems just cave to pressure. That it's limited also gives early investors some confidence that the value of their investments will rise as Bitcoin is properly adopted but that is a secondary consideration to how Bitcoin is a new leap forward in what is possible.. currently at the far end is Ethereum, looking at putting Turing complete computing to a blockchain that we can start to see the prospects for distributed companies, that need little management.

It won't have immediate effect but it's like an inverse catch-22.. the more there is accessibility, the more merchants might accept bitcoin, the more they might understand the opportunity for growing services and economy. It's a step in the right direction, where the tipping point is will vary for person to person. In the event that sovereign currencies falter again in the way that we've already seen in the EU, then bitcoin might be well placed to add support and confidence back to compensate that.

Trade requires trust and typically that involves a third party. Bitcoin solves the problem of trust on the internet.
A "Blockchain" adopts the position of third party authority. Bitcoin has potential to go beyond just currency and offers digital tokens that have value pegged to match other assets. Tokens can also be explicitly linked to instances of real world assets.
A token pegged by consensus to the value of the RMB, could be really useful in helping online trade. Transfers by Bitcoin are very cheap and fast, allowing for micropayments and other uses not possible with traditional technology.

That's just relaying the dull and ignorant big business rulez ok of yesterday. Evidently you don't understand or care for what Bitcoin offers us and how it makes for a better world; perhaps you have  avested interest in retarding the world and limiting us to only what you and yours provide but that is not good enough.
The law when it isn't corrupted, looks to what is better for society, not what will make big business more money.
Selfish businesses should not win life, any more than selfish people; both should expect reality to kick them in the nuts from time to time.

It's not a serious bug for Bitcoin, it's a minor one that's been known since 2011 and that exchanges should manage already. It's a serious bug for MtGox.
The transaction isn't invalidated by the transaction id being altered, the coins still go to the right address. It's just that an attack can dupe a noobish exchange into thinking there's been a problem, so they resend more coins.

It's not about speculation, it's about utility. 
In the real world if I give you something you know you've received it; on the internet, you receive only a copy of something. What Bitcoin provides is a way for everyone to agree that a transaction has occurred.. that's all Bitcoin is but that is valuable, which is why it's become usable as currency. If you tie assets to coins - single satoshi's even, then that is coloured coins; you can then exchange the ownership with someone else directly. So, your car could know it's owner based on the block chain and exchanging the coin related to that changes the reality of who owns the car.. or a gold bar or any other asset.
The action of removing the need for third party authorities is an efficiency saving and it's also empowering in a good way that frees up what is possible and practical - it's cheaper than any traditional offering. This is what progress looks like. More efficient actions makes more volume in the economy too, which is growth.
and we're only being to imagine what will be possible now that we can exchange with confidence directly person to person online.

PoW(ork) requires a tonne of electric and a competition for who's got the hardware to match; PoS(take) is about statistics and chance relative to your stake (how much money you hold in the wallet).. you typically commit a chunk of your holdings and put that to work, and relative to what others have made available, you get a chance at claiming blocks. PoS is more environmentally friendly as a result.. which is why PPC branding is or at least was green colour. There's also DPoS, Delegated PoS where the miners are elected notionally based on their capability to provide a stable network - BitShares is using DPoS.

Keep it simple. Talk about how to buy and use Bitcoin. Ignore the technically geeky math side and credit the fact that it works to its brilliant designers; users do not need to understand or even appreciate the design and hard work, in order to benefit and use Bitcoin.
Avoid talking comparisons to fiat.
Suggest simply that it is electronic gold and that the fees to transfer money person to person are a fraction of what tradition banks and money transfer services can offer.
The network is apparently faster than credit cards and the risk of fraud is so low, that merchants don't need to wait for confirmations on small purchases.
Talk about how it makes buying online easier and in real life, it empowers the consumer.
Avoid politics - don't talk about how it will do away with traditional banking.
The future is a place where the consumer is in control of their own money.

Some insight into how merchants are affecting the market too would be useful, though I don't know how that can be resolved.
I'd expect that noobs like Microsoft might be dumping all the XBox Bitcoin they get. Until there are trivia ways to buy outweighing options to spend, it's likely there will be pressure on BTC. Compounded with good alt options in Bitcoin2.0 drawing investments from older holders, it's unlikely that BTC will spike until business money starts flowing into options like CounterParty and perhaps BitShares. There needs to be a pull for business to engage their wealth rather than just abuse Bitcoin into fiat. MaidSafe perhaps might be the first big business draw?.. Guess we'll just have to wait it out and see.
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:44:07

It's the same with most merchants, they take the dollar equivalent and the BTC gets offloaded - unless the third party is holding those.. but the volume is too much surely.. especially when price is falling, bitPay etc will sell into the market, just as if M$ had done handling themselves.
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:14:54

You missed the banking sector getting its head around basic questions. It's currently more about learning (basic orientation); sharing ideas (wonderments) and insights (few). So, some way to go before there's any 'leadership' but key interests from traditional banking were represented.
There seem to be a few efforts to create accelerators and so perhaps from the crowd will emerge real expertise. BoE rep talked of their current research and how legislation might not necessarily be the same as old banking.. but made clear indication that they consider that confidence comes from stability and therefore by their logic, necessarily that requires regulation. So, they are not fully understanding the potential but it's a step in the right direction. There's expected to be more of the same each month on different related topics tbc.

I'm glad it is cut and dry then but it's not obvious relative to the strong pressure for private chains coming from traditional banking. BoE; Fed; ECB; Barclays, etc.. The concern was simply that if Symbiont has been created to exploit CounterParty's potential and cater to the interests of those others, then all bets are off about the implementation. It's incidental that the same tech deployed XCP.

Yes.. but "based on CounterParty technology", is not the same as stating using CounterParty and XCP. The devs could have cloned the code and spawned a new private currency for the purpose.

You seem a little confused about what is a currency and what isn't.
Bitcoin is a currency, if people say it is.
The Dollar is a currency, if people say it is.
Something stops being currency only when it can't act as exchange of wealth. If the dollar in your pocket cannot buy what you want, they it is only paper; or silk; or toilet-roll; or whatever makes a dollar.
Money that represented Gold and Silver, was a currency both because people said it was something they would exchange Gold and Silver for and that then people understood Gold and Silver are inherently valuable - that is they are wealth not just representing it.
What you can't suggest is currency is that which is quickly perishable. If a currency holds its form, then it can be used to represent wealth.
Wealth matters; money does not - and what you use to represent wealth, doesn't really matter.

It's a means of exchange. Litecoin is apparently being created faster than Bitcoin, so might have an advantage of not being so much the investment that Bitcoin is looking like, and more the coin you spend with - sooner than Bitcoin perhaps. The move to supporting other coins for existing services will be trivial. If Bitcoin is going large, then others could easily become successful partly from that success and using the same methods. For coins that provide more exotic characteristics of the protocol, perhaps it'll take more effort to develop support and availability.

The best option is to buy and sit on it. Invest and understand the idea and don't look to make profit in fiat. The market is too volatile to predict and alt-coins are being leveraged and pumped and dumped in ways you can't control.
If you did play the market, you might make profit but only because the market is rising and you would be losing relative to simply holding coins bought asap at a good price within the obvious up and down over a few days.. so try to avoid the peaks and then find another hobby for a couple of years and then spend as bitcoin rather than cash out in a fiat fall, which requires that you spend that quickly.

Again, not sure which point you're trying to make.
Those with an axe to grind (for what reason?) tend to overstate the reality they would like to see.. but that doesn't evidence reality in the real world.
In any case, even if Bitcoin was currently used for purchase of illegal goods, that still is no statement about its potential to be useful to people widely.
Given the state of fiat, you would have to be naive or disingenuous to not understand that Bitcoin offers a safer store of wealth than trusting those who have shown themselves to be incompetent. Obviously there maybe a risk in shortterm but longterm Bitcoin has huge potential to be better than fiat. Pick a random fiat if you want but why trust fiat where you can have an alternate invulnerable to the greed and stupidity of others?
The internet will benefit from having a good method of transmitting wealth that is not controlled by middlemen scrapped fractions they do not deserve. It's in the interests of people widely to have an option that resists other people's stupidity.. selfish people will argue otherwise. Those who can only think about how they benefit from fiat's weakness, will worry about losing that but again that's no statement of why Bitcoin is not better than fiat.

Not so.
Government stupidity is not about the individuals, it's about the systemic errors. If you've ever worked in a big organisation, you'll know well the poor communication and slow ponderous way that progress is made; Government is worse.
The People is a broad spread of perspectives; Government represents a set of opinions and the intent then is some consensus relating to that; the actioning is a far cry from the intent.
Consider the difference of central power and local influence and you'll begin to see what is wrong at the moment. If we handed more power and wealth to the people and distributed that more evenly, then the people would have better capability and more dynamic response at a local level, to problems that reality throws them. As it is there is slow response and little by way of wisdom in Government; the result is far more short sighted than people would normally allow.
Consider what traditional Government has achieved over the last few decades. War that we didn't want and can't afford; and a broken economy. If we had democracy, the people's response would be more in tune with reality. The problem with politics currently is that we have leaders, who really don't know what Government is for.. Government is for enabling the People, not controlling problems; not artificially inflating the economy by strongly defending the national interest and kneecapping our ability be productive.. parental Government just make the People weak and dependant.
No - Government is necessarily stupider than the parts. Governments lag their people by a couple of decades as they take time to absorb new understanding. The more devolved the power the better for all of us and the quicker more advanced thinking will be adopted. Especially at a time where the financial crisis risks sudden change, it's important that we are able to adapt.
Also, the perception of Bitcoin being dominated by libertarians/anarcho-capitalists is naive.


Being cynical is lazy; that view perhaps is too common in the establishment. People's interest in politics is badly compromised by our economics and politics having thrown money at problems rather than solutions.. but that will change and there's a good change it'll change very rapidly as the economic crisis begins to bite.

Just having a capability to choose the wallet location would answer that. Perhaps that would help security too, if trojans didn't know where to look.

Ok. Aside from the obvious, one of the fundamental problems with the financial crisis is the way that over the last few decades (some would argue more), we've become lazy because we have easy money. We leverage the future, if a problem arises, we throw money at it. The People widely have become disengaged from politics, they don't understand that politics is important; the effect of that is that we have lazy and properly unrepresentative Governments (not representing our best interests in the way they would do IF the People understood what was affecting then and what good representation is relative to what they have).
Bitcoin offers the potential to transfer Power and Wealth from the consolidated focal points we see today in politics and big business; handing that to the People, that they can then articulate what is important.
Having People suggest what is important brings a more dynamic society better able to respond to the challenged that life throws at us.
We do not need, many of us do not want, big celebrity parental Government that leads us. We do not need leaders, we need Governments that understand their role is properly to enable the people.

Good Governments does not follow from controlling and managing the People. Just because they may 'want' power and control of a noun, does not suggest 'must' have that.


Perhaps that's why you prefixed your sentence with unfortunately, like it's inevitable. The behaviour of Government is only ever inevitable, while we tolerate it.
It is not Government that wants to control and regulate money; it's more simply the existing Power and Wealth that is working to retain and grow what it controls. That is not then what is good for people widely.

The fullproof answer would be to ensure you have the wallet in a separate location, then delete all and restart with a fresh install, download the blockchain and replace the blank wallet that creates with the backup real wallet. Obviously, do the replace while the program is shutdown. As it comes back up, it'll rescan the chain for integrity and in doing so will note the balance on the account stored in the wallet.
If it's not obvious to you, the wallet is the private key; the balance is in the blockchain that everyone has copy of.
I don't know, how you've got that error above, why it would stick at 9 days and not just chew though whatever that is, given time. I can't remember offhand when the upgrade to 0.85 occured, perhaps the old blockchain you had is a branch that doesn't apply now.

I think it's quite likely that traditional money is rather panicked about the potential for Bitcoin and then trying to make it appear less than it is.. with all the trolls and resources they can muster for that. The timing for that attempt is to nip it in the bud.. if we can get through the first few attempts then I expect they will throw traditional legislation at it; just like the big media and DRM.. they're taking away our business and control of the market .. it isn't fair.. wahh .. we can't compete and innovate.. etc .. etc.
Hopefully to counter that, Governments will realise that Bitcoin offers a good opportunity to them and encourage it's adoption. A more dynamic local ownership and control of money, will be substantially healthy for the economy.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:51:11
I wasn't being disingenuous at all. What I suggested was simple statement of the nature of money.
People do not understand money relative to wealth, let alone subtlety about fiat money relative to real economy and the financial crisis.
Obviously, the dollar backed by the US economy is a powerful currency; though its standing as world reserve is rather suspect and could suffer but even in worst case, it's likely the dollar would still act as currency - its value would flux but the function would remain.
Suggesting that "all else (that is, all that is not legal tender) is a commodity" is being disingenuous. You should know full well that the nature of Government and those that say that something is so, is just one bunch of people. The Government is people, notionally all the people, stating a consensus; but the Government does not have a monopoly on consensus - even if it was ever pretentious enough, to suggest that it has a monopoly on consensus of all - which no large Government ever will.
Regardless of whether you want to fuss about the naming of that which acts as currency - commodity or not, the point seems moot. The function matters, the legal status doesn't. If people want to use stones to represent wealth then that is currency.. just not one that's much recognised.
Making out that Bitcoin is a commodity also makes no sense for something that has no intrinsic value. Everything that Bitcoin is relates to its function as currency.. it is currency by default.

If Bitcoin were outlawed, it would pose a serious question about why. People would wonder at whose interests their Governments were representing, in a way not challenged by any war or other distant issue.. it would be a very dangerous route to take.
Half the reason people are looking for alternates to traditional authority is because the authorities have not done a good job to date representing people's long term interests. If 'they' were stupid enough to bring the issue to a head by stifling what is a good progressive technology, then you might expect people widely might not take kindly to that and perhaps they might even look to hold authority to account for all its other errors.
If authorities did look to to outlaw Bitcoin, it would also reconfirm that they do not understand either the problem or the solutions.

No.. what we need widely is for natural negative feedback to kick in. The reason that people are disengaged from politics, the reason they are fat and lazy is that life isn't challenging them in a normal way. There's no need to penalized people for their stupidity (downvoting them), they just don't benefit from the upvote and that's a downvote in itself. We all action efforts that are in vain. It is only if there was a crime committed, that there should be a penalty; which would be specifically where another person is impacted negatively. Where the 'crime' is victimless there is no crime. Posting badly on a forum like reddit is for the most part a victimless crime. Those who do take a post badly perhaps just need to adjust their thinking, but thinking better then perhaps would deserve an upvote for the catalyst.

It is a bit early to be spending as if it is stable.
First you need wealth drawn into the currency, and with that comes volatility as speculators try to make easy profits.
Eventually, once it's more stable by volume dominating fluctuations, then you can spend in the traditional way.

No, there isn't. They could be stupid and try to frustrate its use but one of the remarkable characteristics of bitcoin is that it's persistent; like water, it will win given time. They might as well just go with the flow, than waste energy and resources fighting it.
Also, bitcoin will be good for the economy, people spending at speed, and we know the economy needs all the help they can get.
Also, bitcoin is international, so it will shine elsewhere if the US tries to dull it; it's better to get in early, transfering wealth into bitcoin later will be more costly and would be a penalty to any nation that discouraged adoption.

No you trust them with a number of your coins.. not all of them. They can use a private key or pay from their own pool, you needn't have a private key for that online account that a debit card draws on. Potentially you might not have access to those coins with anything but the debit card and an option to withdraw to your Bitcoin accounts elsewhere if you wished. Keep it simple, it doesn't been to offer everything that Bitcoin protocol can do; the flexibility is there for those who want it or for other services to provide.

Despite other replies, I think you should switch it to mBTC throughout.
As it stands you have a confusing statement of the number of BTC "until the price goes above [mBTC] price" alongside a statment of BTC and total currency. That sentence should be consistent in unit and changing the price to BTC makes no sense.
You could suggest "until the price *of a mBTC* goes above [mBTC] price" but I don't see that's better. In the case of large numbers of mBTC depth of market use k; M; Billions even to reflect that.

Positive feedback alone makes us lazy and takes us off at a tangent from reality.

That's not correct.
A currency is valued by the wealth that it represents; and its ability to transfer that wealth.
If there is no forum for communication, then of course online currency might become less useful.. but calling the end of the internet, might be a bit premature?..
Also, if you know anything about Bitcoin, it's clear that it's not all speculation. Given the risks to fiat at the moment, it's quite possible Bitcoin will become interesting for other reasons.
It could all still fall flat and certainly a large part of currency is about the confidence in it but just for SR failing, isn't likely to be sufficient to force that. There's every reason to be confidence about Bitcoin itself; and it's still early days; so, it's potential for being useful, is still being defined.

Given the risk to fiat in the next few years, it's not unwise to look at something as stable as bitcoins to avoid that. I'd expect more of the same for a year at least, before real merchant and lite clients are available making using bitcoins practical and the market dominated then by use as currency rather than investment/hedge against fiat. If the housing market ever does properly correct/collapse, I'd expect that will be a big disruptor to normal currencies. Exciting times whichever way it goes.

The website isn't functioning in a way that doesn't look crippled, so there'd nothing to hack. If you can't trust the withdrawal function to not recognise valid BTC address, then that doesn't suggest confidence on your part; which again is discouraging a serious robust hack trial.

Bitcoin allows more fluid transfer of money, so GDP rises.
Governments will create their own cryptocurrency.. but their ability and inclination to warp the money is tempered by experience from the financial crisis.
People widely better understand and appreciate negative feedback, and politics as a result will appear more relevant to everyone. The People will hold their Governments to account and expect more dialogue and sensible representative action, esp with regard to expensive actions like foreign policy.
The rigour of cryptocurrencies will allow both power and wealth to spread more evenly; those who currently exploit their position and resources will lose that ability to leech off others.
It's all good - Bitcoins are the lubrication to the administrative function that is money, that is the communication of wealth.
As a result of a better spread of power and wealth, we will see more real democracy. People's interests will find a voice and I expect people's sense of community and their quality of life will rise as a result.
Bitcoin might then help us focus on quality of life and less on money.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:17:08

The more impt part of what's occurring is the drawing of wealth into Bitcoin.

duh.. that's a noob interpretation.
If you're coming at this from traditional approach of grabbing what you can from others, then yes bitcoin is not for you and you will lose out. Buying coins and using them, noone loses out and everyone wins. Buying and selling and making a volatile market might be of interest to those threatens by what bitoin offers and those greedy types that cause the financial crisis but that's not what most people are interesting in. What most people want is to shed the old selfish monopoly on power and wealth and that is something that cryptocoins offer.

Top of head:
Something equivalent to Debit card would help adoption and use. That would be a huge +ve.
Make owning and using Bitcoins foolproof. Need to worry less about when and how to backup wallets; user agents need to perhaps prompt user to make a backup as needed.
The big issue atm is having a reliable exchange that can deal with matching buyers and sellers in the way that normal exchanges do. Looking forward then to see what Max Keiser's exchange becomes.
If it is to be a currency, then it needs to be useful - useable and available where and when people want it. The services that can enable quick transactions, helping avoid double spending, could become very important.
Real world promotion might help establish Bitcoin as an option in communities.
Educating .gov about the opportunity that Bitcoin offers and helping them resolve their concerns about how businesses interact with Bitcoin and the needs of .gov - income taxes, for example. Make it easy for people to get paid in Bitcoins.
Education, paralleling Bitcoin effort, about other alt-currencies and the potential advantages of those will be impt too.

That seems like an interesting thought until you think it through. Taking money out of the market is doing no-one a favour; it's not supporting the market, it's simple adding volatility - and adding to the perception that people are thinking short term about leveraging Bitcoin for a quick profit. No, if you want to not seen to be robbing wealth from Bitcoin and the people investing in it, then you simply buy; hold; and spend freely, with some disregard for the fiat equivalent.

No, that's slightly back to front.. it represents for those people, access to illegal drugs etc; not the drugs themselves - that just suggests an irrational prejudice against Bitcoin. You could infer, it is representing an interest to spend. Obviously then, if the ability of a currency to be useful is affected, it becomes less useful. However, Bitcoin's future is potentially much bigger than any one market and given the risk relating to fiat and US dollar stabliity, Bitcoin does offer a useful alternative route in dodging that risk.

Not sure I agree with that line of thinking.
The spike in prices and the rush to sell, looks a lot more like speculators trying to leverage profit than seriously adopting Bitcoin. No doubt some damage done but the fall was always going to occur, that's just a natural consequence of speculators getting raped by HFT and others who understand market behaviour better.
What we need is to build confidence and what I'd like to see then is speculators frustrated. If that requires a limit on the number of trades per time or verified accounts before trade, then so be it.

The communication of interests is inefficient, there's no surprise there. The same problem with committees making decisions - poor communication of interests relative to those who manage the conversation and how. 
The point about democracy is more about what the trend over time, what it tends to.. and what its motivation is.
The point above is that the more you empower people, then more you give them opportunity to directly represent their own interests and to consider more closely who they nominate to represent their interests for what issue, the more indicative that representation is.
What we have now is clumsy and crude. One vote on every issue for someone far removed for those we really relate to. Everything that is frustration with politics follows from who is representing us and how. Other voices will dominate and only major issues will be addressed at the wrong time in the wrong way, where there are only a few players invovled; involving everyone more directly, gives better results throughout the society. Obviously, it's not practical for individuals to represent themselves on all interests but I suspect the happy medium is someway from where we are now.

The idea of having a flyer is good but you need to understand sales and how to persuade other people. No-one reads flyers.. flyers are pointers, for people who are interested. Grab people's interest and tease them with the idea; don't overwhelm them with detail they are not yet wanting.
Avoid complexity. Avoid controversy. Avoid any reference to Politics; Sex; or Sport. Avoid telling people what they "should" do! Give them positives and re-enforce them.
So, don't talk about how it'll free you from the worry about what Banks and Governments might do with your fiat. Don't talk about those elements that might be mistaken as negatives.

"Democracy", as with so many politics words, is an ambiguity. It's root though is greek for "The People" and at its best, it manifests as voice that properly represents the people.
In reality, of course, voting a minority to represent the broad spread and variety, leads to some minorities not being represented.
The pont stands that Good government will look to empower its people. In so doing, democracy will become more representative - and more dynamic and faster to respond to challenges too.
Just because we have big clumsy thud and blunder at the moment, doesn't suggest we can't do better.
So, you're wrong; democracy does follow from the people.. whichever way you view it, what results is from the people - those empowered are voted from the people; how representative that is, might be up for debate.

You could challenge that about any suggestion of "how" - do we need to state the bleeding obvious too? Perhaps you're on the wrong side of the equation and wondering about how that is 'managed'.. news flash.. the People do not need to be managed! It if the role of .gov to enable the People not to manage them.
People may want parenting but the proper role of .gov in a democracy, is to give them what they need; not what they want.
So, know your target and do not consolidate power and wealth where you have the opportunity. Haircut the rich, if needed but cut the risk and throw resources at the base elements that support a functioning economy - food; energy; education. The People are more powerful than .gov, they are better placed to resolve the financial crisis and any other range of problems that we encounter. 
It is fundamental to democracy that .gov trusts the people - that was Blair+'s mistake, trying to lead us - we don't want leaders - because, as he showed especially well, we are then subject to amplified errors put upon us.

I don't see why multiple wallets necessarily suggests multiple passwords.. just multiple locations.

Sure - but make the GUI handle multiple wallets and encrypt by default, at least. Right now you need to understand what you are doing, with cash it's a bit easier to relate to.

VAT - sales tax; it's easy to oblige merchants to collect.
Government has no right to steal people's wealth directly.
They could levy a tax per head - poll tax in UK didn't take off though.
The better way is to move to a position that the population is more engaged and supports services that are important to them. It's more efficient spend for people to pay direct to the services they use or want to see. Government is an overhead to what could be activity without their involvement.
So, lower tax burden and more responsibility all round. Certainly the level of Government we have at the moment - Big Brother etc is not realistic.
Cut the Department of War budget and other unecessary element of parental oversight; put those clever people to work in the real economy and then you'll have an economy.
Governments sometimes appears scared of the reality of democracy but a good Government necessarily needs to trust and have confidence in its people.
Also, it's better that people understand the real cost associated with what they consume.. if energy; education; food etc cost real value rather than tax - then subsidy - then unreal illusion, that is better.

To preserve confidence in their exchange.
They could and perhaps should put a rule whereby they can cease or stop trades by accounts behaving like bots trying to overwhelm the market or fix the price.

The idea is to enable people to lose their money to those they want to give their money too.. that's the whole point. If you are creative, then you should draw a profit - IF you are making more than average contribution. In an ideal world though, you would make zero profit and still contribute and get reasonable reward. Growth economy beyond population growth is exploitation.


That's not an issue that those looking to use bitcoin need to worry about, especially when considering how they might use this new currency. If bitcoins are going large, then they will need to be able to handle real volume at speed. The size of blockchain will reflect the activity but needn't reflect all history - it's an issue the developers are looking into.

Not in a paniced way, just the same motivation that has people look to gold.. medium term store of wealth.
Compounded with that western banks strip transactions to line their own pockets, Bitcoins functionality is an obvious attractor.. as you've noted it is in China.
I'm not sure that enthusiam for using Bitcoin is dominate yet, though with more merchants and novelties like buying pizza it's certainly helping.
So the pont above was it's not Snowden. It's more that what we have doesn't offer what people want.. pushing them away. Enthusiasm for Bitcoin will follow from appreciating it and that comes from closer inspection than most people will have done.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:02:48
Yeah, yeah.. everyone's guessing. Reality is never best case or worst case, it'll be somewhere inbetween this occasion too.
There's no good reason for Governments to frustrate what people want. It's new and it's got some way to go yet. Anything gold can do Bitcoin can do better and if that is all it is, it'll do just fine.. if it's more, then that's cool too. Some capabilities might conflict with traditional economics and some might try to frustrate those for a while but there's no keeping down an idea that's of its time.

That's the reality now but Good Government would be enabling not coercive. Just because what we have sucks, doesn't mean it can't be done better.

Don't mistake them as mere cats.. namecoin; devcoin; ppcoin are providing interesting alt direction.

It would be suspicious, if he made even one transaction that could be traced back. If Dodgy Dealer B's address is known, then it's trivial for anyone to trace the pool of addresses feeding that from the public blockchain; if any of those addresses then are publicly linked to real person then they get tainted.

Perhaps to be accepted it only needs to equal the security of credit cards.
Something that doesn't hold all your money but enough for the transactions you expect in a reasonable period of time.
So, if we are happy to trust pin numbers now, perhaps we can trust a third party bank-like entity that acts as support between stranger-customer and stranger-merchant. That third party then broadcasts to the network quickly enough the transaction in order there is less likely to be a duplicate payment before total confirmations and/or holds the wealth in an account itself for the customer so they are the reference point for the transaction and not the Bitcoin network.
Hell, we do this already with debit cards, so until someone thinks of a way that directly does use the Bitcoin network, or until we jump to a faster confirmation coin, that would do.
In fact, using what hardware is in place already, would be a much faster route to adoption too. No new equipment even, just perhaps a new card that is drawing on a Bitcoin account and relating to the merchant in their preferred currency.. whatever that might be.
I'll take 10% cut on the profits you make with that idea :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:49:19
Are you confident those new accounts aren't simply bots associated with the thousands of 0.02 sell orders?
When will you bring online support for the other cryptocurrencies?
Perhaps you could clone your exchange in a simple way and spread the risk.
Have you considered what is in the interests of getting Bitcoin to be a useful currency might not be what is simply a trading exchange and that limited accounts ability to do quick trades might be a way forward. If you are serious about Bitcoins+, then perhaps you do not need API and bots turning over multiple order on a single account in a short period of time? Anything to frustrate the HFT might be worth doing if it provides the market more confidence and more stability.

Just wait for the bottom, IF there is a big move.
However, the best route to Bitcoin is to think only about what you want to do over the period of a couple of years. If you're in it to make a quick profit in fiat because fiat is all you understand, then good luck with that but better to understand what Bitcoin represents relative to retaining wealth. The growth in Bitcoin as it establishes itself is a one off long-term growth - you can't really guess that in the short term but you can in the long term.

Not sure I follow what you're getting at.
Downvotes aside, the point is about making it easy/trivia to pass money directly to those who deserve it.
Bitcoins don't need to be passed as whole coins because they are the value they are, it's possible to give very small amounts and spread a small affordable amount widely. Like giving 1 'supermarket saving token' value $0.0001. tipbot does seem to be working already doing this.. @_date: 2013-04-10 18:08:49

It's still there.. (International) Bank Transfer.. send GBP to their Japan account with your MtGox account number in the comment, as per the instructions - read those instructions for the bank detail and abc sending guide. Don't convert to another currency, or you'll incur the charge for that. They then receive as GBP and you'll see it there four working days after you Bank actions it. So it'll go from your account; you won't be able to see it as it goes through the Japan Bank but that's ok. It's simple.. just need to be patient for that to happen. I've done it several times now and without any problem. If you do have over zealous bank fraud tripwires on your account, then you might need to deal with those.. but it's worked well for me and should do for you.
There is no reason for the UK Banks to block you buying something that hasn't even been confirmed as currency. It's just a product like any other; they have no right to stop you buying what you want with your money - and they know that.

"know"? You guess..
Good governments and then democratic governments, should want to empower their people, rather than control them.
Certainly it'll be interesting to see how it plays out over time. It would be odd for traditional economics not to resist change.
Given the weakness and vunerablity of fiat and given that anything gold can do bitcoin can do better, it's quite possible that Governments won't be able to resist the need and appitite for people using Bitcoin. There's no good arguement for them resisting it and given time they will come round to see the benefit. The population that embraces it sooner will do better in the long run.

That is why it is important to encourage Government to get on board. Governments for the most part, follow from their People's interests. It is in the People's interests that Bitcoin does succeed.
Governments need to get their head around using cryptocurrency; we should not have to fight them. We do have to be cautious about the usual level of stupidity and thud and blunder; and of those vested interests that will not like losing control.. but it's a change we can win.

I expect all those trading currency will eventually need to comply with rules governing .gov anxiety about illegal activities. Exchange of fiat in and out of BTC could worry those tasked with monitoring the laundering of money in the traditional sense.
I don't know OKPay but that above looks like a traditional payment transfer company with the jitters. Bitcoin offers an option to do away with such third parties, so only natural they will not encourage it.
Bit cheeky them telling you what you can spend your money on though..

Is that not a comment more about the lake of other exchanges and the behaviour of the users? Those are not within MtGox's control.

China is getting in for I don't know why, aside from a sensible instinct for real wealth. They don't have an immediate currency problem - or maybe they do feel vunerable to the dollar. Certainly they're buying rare earth and gold and bitcoins and good luck to them I say.

It is, that's my point. It's also to be expected that it would be at this point. That doesn't suggest it will always be.. once the volume of those using it as currency dominates the smaller amount of speculators activity, they'll be less volatility. Beware then chasing money in Bitcoin.. buy them; hold them; and spend them later. If you dip in and out, it's a gamble; you could win and you could get stung.

The backup will be at risk is it was unencrypted and you encrypt the working wallet.
The backup will also be at risk if the wallet makes use of 100 addresses.
Each transaction apparently can use multiple addresses dealing with change. So, perhaps developers in future will make this more obvious to the user. Having used ~100 addresses the wallet will create another 100 addresses, knowing when that happens then would be an indication user needs to make a backup.
If your wallet is offline and you're not using it, then you can send more BTC to that address. The wallet; the paper; the brain; etc is only a store for the private key. The money is in the network blockchain via a summing of transactions - the point is it is only accessible to the persons holding the private keys to that address.
I suspect that even in worst case, it might still be possible to export the private key from an old backup and recover by importing to a new wallet.. but I'm not sure about that yet.

It's a bit of a stretch.. but how would a .gov introduce a cryptocurrency in a stable way?
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:48:16
There is some issue that at encryption the server creates a new set of 100 addresses to draw on. That make any unencrypted backup outdated, so make a backup once you encrypt. I'm not sure the private key itself changes. Apparently there is also a risk around the time you have made 100 transactions - which itself might not be obvious, as each transaction can involve fractions of the payment from various addresses and change into new ones. Just make lots of backups - perhaps split off an amount into a wallet you use a lot and worst case you'll retain the rest.. or just be careful until the applications become more foolproof.

It's to be expected that those in traditional economics will resist change.. after all they do have it easy.. for no input, they sit on a 'gravy train'.
.. and it would be odd if Bitcoin was adopted without resistance.

Well there is a thought.. that those in office are the clever crims.. but it's a simple thought and they are also the most exposed; so, perhaps not so clever given the climate.
However, you miss the key point, that society is the only action of real change against that which is not in the interests of people widely.
The thought of there being survival of the fittest criminal, is away from reality. The point was to highlight the fallacy of those who consider that putting down crime is a solution; it's not. You don't solve the problem of crime by punishing criminals.

Sure but the point is that Bitcoin is bigger than just SR.. even now, Bitcoin is in the earliest stages and it's potential in future is obviously much greater.
Those who hate Bitcoin now, have no reason to be so passionate; it just makes them look shallow.
All currencies are subject to use by drug-dealers and others that the normal don't approve of but that's no statement against the potential of Bitcoin to act as currency.. it's a statement that it can be used as a currency. In a place where people have ever reason to not trust one another.. they trust Bitcoin. So, Bitcoin might take a knock from SR ending or a pause while a.n.other takes up the strain of that demand.. so what.
I don't understand why people are so keen to challenge Bitcoin's capability in the face of it's doing exactly what it promises.. perhaps they are afraid of losing control over other people or they have an easy credit line in fiat.. my bet is just ignorance.. but that's fine.. Bitcoin has everything it needs to prove itself useful and if it takes a while for people to catch on, so be it.
What would you recommend instead?.. looking to ye olde fiat!?.. the US dollar is the strongest default fiat currency.. excuse me but even the US president is moving beyond denial.. [Barack Obama warns of default danger](
