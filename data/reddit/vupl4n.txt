At least not until the last bitcoin has been mined... so we’re talking like 100years of wait, or more...
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:27:20
What do you mean if I expect it to go up? My savings or the bitcoin value?
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:23:16
I agree though it's kinda hard excluding emotion especially if you're a first timer like me.
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:19:59
Where'd you buy it?
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:19:02
Well I don't totally disagree with you but, I'm not an expert or anything, I think not basing your investment techniques in luck has more positive outcome. By just spending everything without at least knowing if it has positive outcome or not, is just basically relying in luck.
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:49:10
Well currently I don't have anyone to support but myself but at the same time I don't wanna end up in the street if somehow (though I doubt) tomorrow bitcoin suddenly lose it's value.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:35:21
Oh okay. It says BitGo is an online wallet in bitcoin.org though, but anyways, any alternative?
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:38:13
I only started buying last month. If I'm correct, that's when the hard fork was announced, wasn't it?
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:29:22
I want to but, I'm kinda skeptical. If I'm going to do it, it'll actually be my first time investing on anything. And I just don't want to just invest everything on my first time.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:39:19
Yeah, I kinda get it, but it's so tempting to sell at this price, especially if you bought in when it was still in 4800-ish... That's like 1000 gain in what? like a week or 2?
I dont know if thats big, Im not an investor or anything, in fact I'm fairly new too....
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:57:27
I see, is it the same with ledger nano s? Coz thats what I bought.
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:53:52
Yeah, that's what I thought. I'm actually figuring out the perfect amount to invest. Or if someone has a good logical reason for me to invest it all, then maybe I would.
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:13:54
Well if we're gonna talk about living on the street vs living under the bridge, I assume living on the street gives you more opportunity. And I don't even like to live on the street
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:43:27
Duuuude, how fast did you calculate that?
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:15:21
1. Yes
2. No
3. I don't get it
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:00:26
But at least something's coming back right? So you still won't end up in the street. I don't really know anything about investment.
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:00:11
Look at it like this, in 2016ish, 1btc = $3000ish. If you invest 10$ per month, let say like from Jan to Dec, you'll spend 120$ (12 x 10) or 0.036BTC (10$ = .003).
Now 1BTC = 5300ish... 5300 * 0.036 = 190.8$, you could've earned 70$.
Now, if BTC continues to grow, that earning will get large too by time. Now let's say 1BTC gets to $10K, 10,000$ / 0.036BTC = $360. You're 120$ is now $360.
It's never too late man.
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:23:19
But from what I read, when the hard fork occurs, hard fork becomes the new chain. You can still continue mining from the old chain but every bitcoin you mine will be useless because the hard fork is not backwards compatible, which means, you'll have the same amount of coins, not double. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:51:30
Getting hacked? Wait what are you talking about? I read somewhere there is bug but getting hacked?
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:03:48
Wait, who? YRuafraid?
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:49:56
Yeah, I think I'm going with exodus. Also lost of good reviews in cryptocompare, to be honest though, I really never heard of this before.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:39:12
You create 5 account. Split them into 1m each then sell all of it and then transfer the money to your bank account, withdraw 1k dollar every day, put it somewhere safe until you withdraw everything, then go to mexico and spend it all on cocaine....
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:02:23
I think it's because of this, a while ago everyone bought so many bitcoins because they think the amount of bitcoin they have when the fork happens will get doubled. But now, turns out that segwit2x developers suddenly gone missing or there are no devs or something like that. So now all those people who bought so many bitcoins before are now trying to sell, which floods the market with sellers but the problem is, there are no buyers...
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:52:14
Well most business now have a Investment Insurance, bitcoin on the other hand... I don't think it has some kind of insurance. Not that I know of.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:55:30
You think so?
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:47:44
That's actually what I am thinking right now...
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:15:19
The sudden rise a little while made everyone lose their minds, so everybody bought and hodl. Now theres nobody buying coz they already bought.
If there are more buyers, price go up, if there are more sellers, price go down... 
Thats supply and demand in general.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:37:59
Dude! Your funny you know? You're like my GF lul, you said a lot of things but you don't even answer the question, it's a simple yes or no...
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:37:58
I never heard of these before. So can I access Segwit and Segwit2x coin from those?
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:21:24
So if it reached 25k, what then, you gonna sell?
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:11:52
Oh shit RIP...
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:26:30
Well, one rule of investing though is, "Only invest what you can afford to lose"... 
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:23:36
Oh okay, thats just what I heard though. So the core will still maintain the current chain? Is that what you're saying?
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:58:23
Not completely, but it adds security...
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:36:42
Actually I lied, there is Trezor and Nano S in amazon here, but they're out of stock and next batch arrive sometime in November. That's why I'm looking for any alternatives.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:24:25
A little bit, in fact getting crazier day by day just by looking at the btc value...
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:35:40
So buy then, is that what you&amp;re saying?
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:50:21
Exodus looks promising. Also supports a lot of crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:21:49
Hardware wallets are secure for a reason...
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:25:51
Yeah thats what I meant... Again, dont really know anything except from what I read and heard...
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:06:15
I dont really know but in most trading chatrooms they're all like, "Oooh, Xem is so low lets buy that instead", and others were like "I sold all my bitcoin and bought xem instead" or whatevs... so like the demand for bitcoin declined in japan? I dunno though, I'm an idiot potato man...
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:13:01
While agree, I think most people will hesitate if they start loosing money...
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:53:16
Fuck, maybe I should invest and aim for the street...
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:44:09
Not in Japan, I guess... And base on my research, decline is because of some other crypto called NEM or XEM... Don't really anything about it.
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:49:00
You can offload that risk though and pass it to someone else. What I mean by that is having an online wallet instead. But again there are risk too because you are intentionally letting someone else holds your money and not like banks, some are a little bit untrustworthy. But still you don't have to worry about private keys, getting hack (that their problem now) or anything.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:38:28
I believe it's "hodl"? ;)
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:17:48
You mentioned never use online wallets, why? What if I do Bitcoin trading sometimes?
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:07:03
Well first of all, you need to know what blockchain is. It's a technology, it's not only used for crypto/digital coins and there are many possible use case for it.
Also blockchain does not need to be decentralized, open and permissionless. You can implement and use blockchain in your company privately if you want AND IF YOU REALLY NEED IT.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:45:59
I'm sorry I'm dumb, I don't understand. I kinda understand when you sell higher than what you bought, it's a gain, but the potential of it going higher than what's it right now, I just can't stop thinking about it...
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:23:49
Nah, best way to learn is to use your brain... But playing devil's advocate though, majority of people are not very technical like you and most of the people here. So I feel like it's our responsibility to educate those kind of people or else other none technical pips will see those people who got scammed and eventually will turn away from bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:15:26
You don't say anything to them, you just stop talking to them and then ignore them... Are they your friends? If so, find better friends...
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:35:14
Yeah that's what I thought too, but AFAIK, it'll start activating on November, right? Why the decline now? And not the end of October?
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:47:26
I'm 24...
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:19:49
Yeah, we still have almost 5million btc to dig... Really hope it reached more than 100k
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:47:46
Yeah I dont get it, thats why I'm asking... Why are you even here? You're not even helping plus I already get the answer I want. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:30:24
Yeah, I also found this on bitcoincore.org. This was their statement on August.
And also from their statement, "Bitcoin’s consensus rules should only be changed sparingly and with broad agreement from the entire community. Segwit2x, in both its process and implementation, has been opposed by many. Bitcoin Core will continue to support the Segwit soft fork and we look forward to helping Bitcoin scale to new heights over the coming years."
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:58:46
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:43:41
I just told you what I read so far, I afraid I too, don't know what is going on. In fact I wanna buy too.
Here's what I gather so far.
There are 3 possibilities here:
1. Right now, the value is as high as ever and it will continue to rise, in that case it's good to buy now.
2. The value will drop right before the fork, in that case waiting is the best option.
3. You waited because of 2, but then the value did not actually drop and turned out to be 1. Sad face.
We need more info...
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:58:36
Try everything... uhm... Good idea but do really have to? I mean, I only want to get my segwit2x coin.
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:05:08
Yeah, actually I was worried too, I just started buying last month. And now I'm thinking of buying some every month, after I receive my paycheck. Thumbs up.
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:05:12
Although I agree having a hardware wallet is much better, you still have to think about the disadvantages, like having a hardware wallet, just like a normal currency wallet, has a risk of you loosing it or getting corrupted, which is not likely to happen if you're careful enough. But is still a risk. It's like having all your money in your house and not having a bank account. Once something happens like house burning or something and you don't get a chance to save it, it's gone.
Some alternative is getting an account in some asian bitcoin exchange instead, like in Japan or Korea, from what I heard bitcoin exchanges there are already regulated. But like you said "leaving bitcoin on an exchange is like leaving cupcakes on the counter in an elementary school".
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:34:44
Well yeah, but if enough people supports segwit2x more than the current one then people will move to the new chain, and when not enough people supports it, then the current chain will continue, and AFAIK, you can&amp;t use segwit coin with segwit2x and vice-versa, which means you will still have the same coin, not double...
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:26:15
But duuude! It just passed 5300 in 24hour!!! THATS CRAY CRAY!!!
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:37:49
The world should follow Japan and Korea regulating bitcoin trading/exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:40:43
Yeah, actually that custodial wallet is what I have so Im kinda worried about the fork...
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:09:01
That's good man. Plus more buyers means more demands, which means bitcoin will grow too. Also I expect there will a a massive dip before the hard fork so.... save up! LUL
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:27:26
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well...
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:54:21
Majority of people says HODL!!! 1 ticket to 100k please...
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:57:20
Yeah, I agree. According to the internet (Google), fork will start in block 494,784, currently we're at 489,155...
You can check the current block here 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:08:58
I kinda feel you bruh, but what you're saying applies for like 5 or even 10 year from now, right now, bitcoin is only an asset nothing more. That might and will change just like what you said, but it will take time IMO. Also, right now, because it's an asset like stocks, most people are just joining in just to earn quick money...
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:55:49
Aren't most online wallet have 2 factor authentication now. Unless a person is not living under a rock or not extremely old that refused to use technology, I'm pretty sure a common man can use bitcoin too.
What does OP mean by "common man" anyway?
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:20:34


Dude! You're not scared of a sudden dip? Although chances are almost none, but still...
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:18:47
I know that feel bruv... I too wanna sell some but I'm also worried what if there is no dip? Then I'll have less coins now...
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:02:47
I'm really sure but, again from what I read, segwit2x is already approved by the core, which means it's going to happen whether we like it or not. If that happens your current coins will get replicated to the new chain when the hard fork happens, and your old coins from segwit will now be useless because of backward incompatibility.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:44:03
Don't get mad though, we're having a nice convo here. Also although most establishment slowly adapt using bitcoin, not all of them havent support it still to the point that you can use it anytime you go out. Most establishment in your area might support it now, but guess what? There are other countries too who havent open their eyes yet...
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:51:57
Yeah, if you look at the charts, you'll see it's declining too, so everyone is buying that instead... I think? I might be wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:03:40
I kinda get what you're saying but dude, do you know how many wallets are there? Also I believe most have different fees and what not. I don't have a lot of coins and I'm pretty sure I'll lose all of it just by sending coins from wallet to wallet. LUL
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:42:41
AFAIK, based on what I read so far, buying and selling bitcoin is still safe before, during and after the fork. The problem comes in when you receive your bitcoin2x and then try to sell it. Because bitcoin2x does not have a replay protection, when you sell your bitcoin2x, the attacker might use that to access your transaction and that's enough, it seems, for the attacker to have access with your bitcoin authentication info as well, cause they're the same.
Base on some threads, they suggest AVOID TRANSACTING WHEN THE FORK HAPPENS for a while.
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:55:18
Uhm... why?
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:14:06
Yeah I think I will try anymore advice? Also figured I have to act fast if I'm ever gonna do it. Been looking at the current value right now and the value keeps growing $80 per hour, WTF!
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:43:58
Is this real though? I mean with the segwit2x and BTC Gold coming in?
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:24:55
Here's one for coincheck exchange in Japan.
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:33:01
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:43:56
Yeah, but from what Ive read and heard, BCH hard fork was not that serious, compared to the upcoming segwit2x, that time, everybody already knows whats gonna happen and there like no change at all, just a plain copy of the existing chain. The upcoming one though, it might (though I doubt it) split the community depending on the outcome...
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:58:41
Well not if you have an online wallet though.
DISCLAIMER: I have very limited knowledge about the topic.
If you have an online wallet, and the company that holds your coin adapt to segwit2x, for example, then segwit2x does not get popular like segwit, then a couple of things can occur to your coin,
1. The company take your segwit coin, coz now you only have segwit2x coin.
2. They delete your segwit coin coz they believe in segwit2x.
3. They backup your segwit coin so you can still access them while having segwit2x coin.
4. They do 3 but they keep your segwit coin instead and you'll be left with useless segwit2x coin.
Thats all I can think of right now.
Also from what I read, segwit2x and BTC Gold is not backwards compatible.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:46:53
I am new, yeah, just start buying end of last month...
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:17:30
But even though you dont sell all, let's say you sell 1btc, then you'll have 1btc less now. What if value still increases more than 10K?
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:57:24
I see, is it the same with ledger nano s? Coz thats what I bought.
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:07:27
Why? Can you give an explanation?
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:44:40
But I believe Trezor haven't announced anything yet about supporting segwit2x coins. So if they don't support it, you won't get your free coins, right?
