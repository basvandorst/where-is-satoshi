price of gas at the pump is "relatively" stable. Check again the figures I suggest they have 1 order of magnitude between each. We agree we are talking about a price range. But if you want a currency to "work", it needs to have some stability. I'm not referring to a store of value but a mean of exchange, as this is the purpose of LN. Look at venezuela: a country with a highly fluctuating currency is broken. If Bitcoin never achieve to stabilize at level of USD, EUR or main fiats, it will never work as a currency. As USD it can and will evolve, lose half its value or double over time but it still need to have a daily variation &lt;1-2 % to work as a currency. I'm speaking long term obviously.
Maybe this wasn't clear in my initial question, as when I say "when LN works perfectly" I'm thinking in 10 years time min. Sorry if this wasn't clear.

thanks for this great answer. I was actually surprised at what you consider a good fee for the main chain &lt;0.5 USD.
Because that means that miners will collect very little unless we manage to put way more transactions per block, no?
Would love to get more opinions, here. Anyone?

Volume and competition. Even the price of bitcoin should tend to stabilize at one point. In the same way bitcoin fluctuates less than a small altcoin, because its market is bigger. Look at any kind of market (outside crypto) and when maturing, it stabilize. Otherwise it can never become mainstream.

sure, see my answer just above.

I expect things stabilize at one point, even if in 5 years. Otherwise how can you expect a transaction economy to develop if fees are unpredictable all the time?
