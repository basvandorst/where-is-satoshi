Some people just don't want to take any higher risks than they are already taking.
Some people don't want to keep crypto on exchanges for more than 10minutes. 
Some people are not here for trading to make a little money to please internet strangers. 
Some people just believe in the tech and invest in their little life savings for a better future. 
You sir, shouldn't judge anyone! (Thanks for your unwanted opinion, just as mine)

Do you mean the original original Tesla Roadster? Was it called 3.0? Do you know why? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:17:47
Same. I don't have any money to waste. I see people having 2-3 wallets which make me wonder why? The only reason I may consider to buy another is because I can get one with a huge discount.

[QUICK question](
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:54:43
So printing out multiple addresses when generating the paper wallet? 
I learned about address change recently, and I wonder how does it affect the paper wallet ecosystem. Is this the best way to spend:
1. sweep the private key and transfer 'all' of the currency 
2. spend whatever
3. create a new paper wallet and transfer the currency to the new one

Do you know if the ledger nano s can do the same?
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:32:44
I have a ledger nano s and I seem satisfied with it. I don't trade and only hodl. I've been thinking about getting another nano s or even a keepkey using the Salt platform. Is it worth having two devices??
