Ability to predict price movements is an illusion, not a real skill.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:28:49
Yes, every investor makes predictions. And it is always a gamble to a large extent. On the one hand, it is hard to demonstrate that some of them consistently win. On the other hand, it seems that to reduce the role of random chance one would need to go long term based on fundamentals of a business (how solid is business model, was there a history of making profits and such) rather than doing day trading (predicting price movements on a minute or hour level), which is the subject of the discussion.

Do you know what the right times are? Do you believe anyone does?
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:08:51
No. The space of possibilities is so wast that in millions of years of generating random wallets it is next to impossible to stumble across an existing one. The only exception to this would be if some wallets were not truly random due to, say a flaw in some seed generating software, and you somehow exploit that flaw.
@_date: 2019-07-20 03:45:06
Are you making a prediction? It is a bit vague. Try formulating it in a way that it would be testable (so it would be clear, say, tomorrow, if you got it right or not). Keep making such predictions and keep track how many you got right. When you have, say, a thousand (for statistical significance), and the success rate is significantly more than 51%, then you might claim that your method seems to work.
In other words, you could say that a method works if it can be demonstrated to be better then random.

Well, not so fast. Technically nothing is really yours until you are of age. It is a matter of established trust and earned privileges. If you act responsibly, parents can effectively treat some stuff as yours. If no such trust has been established so far, then work on it, but don't expect immediate results.

Trilemma? Is there a difficult choice between tree options?
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:22:40
Why reduce necessarily? This is proof-of-work. It has to be expensive to work. This is the way the distributed consensus is achieved, and attacks are made virtually impossible.
I would think that the market forces will drive some sort of a balance between the cost of resources to maintain the system and the level of risk of attacks given the market capitalization.

And how do you think they can confront? What if you just deny you have anything?

And how do you know exactly? Did you actually look at the numbers? Quite often people just remember a few instances when it was so, but forget instances when it was not. How did you reach your "pretty sure" state? Notice that I am not saying it is not so. I am saying that probably this is one of those "common sense" explanations that "everyone" believes to be true, but almost nobody tried to verify. And your reply sounds like you wouldn't bet money on it.

@_date: 2018-05-29 23:30:27
That is a so-called "common sense explanation". It sounds plausible, but I doubt you have any data to back that up. The real test would be to ask yourself whether you would be willing to make a prediction before the holidays, and how much money would you bet.

“For now, however, Bitcoin has a big problem, and it is growing fast.”
Is this a problem? This is the nature of proof-of-work. It needs to be hard to maintain distributed consensus. There is no better way known (yet). How much is too much for decentralized money? And how does this compare with the price of centralized money?
The article seems to be misguided. And the comparison with Ireland is meaningless.

The traffic is encrypted. There is metadata that there was some traffic from A to B, but that doesn't mean you own some assets. It doesn't even mean that you initiated the traffic. Perhaps, your computer was hacked or something.
It is another story if the government can demand records from the exchange where you have an account and where you made some transactions. In that case you may have to explain.

Good security is hard.
You need to think about what threats you would like to mitigate. Burglary? Robbery? Remote hack? Fire? Flood? Seizure by government? Insider hack (relative)? Your own forgetting or mistakes?
You also have to consider what if something happens to you. Who else should know about this (spouse, children, lawyer, business partner)? The storage scheme might depend on how many parties are involved and their technical expertise.

"No doubt"? The speed of light is a fundamental factor here. Perhaps, the most fundamental of all factors we know of so far. Do you really have no doubt that it can be worked around somehow? Maybe, but there are very good reasons to have plenty of doubts.

I see your clever marketing. A lot of good-sounding words. Systemic and holistic. And all this "detox" rubbish as well.
How do you verify that "complementary therapies" work? If we "complement" science-based medicine with some unproven rubbish the results are supposed to be better somehow?
And what scientific studies do you have to support your "acupuncture devices"?
All this is usual marketing from an "alternative medicine" proponent. Pseudoscience, and can be harmful. I suggest to stay away.

Technical analysis is just a fancy way of gambling. Those analysts delude themselves or fool investors that they can predict the future. The approach you describe should do fine long term assuming that bitcoin keeps getting new adoption and no big technical problems arise. You have to assume something with any investment. Just because you decide to invest into something you essentially bet that it will be worth more in the future.

You are assuming that those banks and governments somehow manage to stay away from this store of value. This is a contradiction. On the one hand, it becomes so popular that everyone uses it, but on the other hand, those bankers have nothing to lose by undermining it.

There is no such thing as Natural Medicine. If some treatment can be shown to work according to modern evidence-based science, it becomes a part of medicine. If It does not work, than proponents try to spin it as "alternative" or "natural" or "integrative" or something like that.

The article seems to miss the point. The "digital gold" claim is based on the fundamental properties such as limited supply and independence of any government. The fact that many investors do not appreciate this yet and treat bitcoin as risky asset does not really bust any myths. Yes, it is risky and volatile at the moment, but if the fundamental properties prove to be solid investors will eventually appreciate them.
