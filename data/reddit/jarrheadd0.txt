Apparently not, according to the socialism-fearers in this thread.

He makes an incredibly compelling argument for the ID at least. I looked up Venezuelan IDs and they don't have the bottom cut off like that. Also you can see a sharp right angle in the upper left of the ID as if it was overlaid with something.

Good, you can also read. That doesn't mean every comment in here is explicitly about bitcoin. Sorry you jumped to a conclusion and then had it's falseness thrown in your face, that must be hard for you. 
 &gt;I've read Das Kapital, the Communist Manifesto, all the Black Panthers, Che, Lenin, Trotsky... I've also read Keynes, Gramsci, Foulcault, some Marcuse and others in the non-Marxist socialist (not calling Foucault a "socialist" but he fits on that list) and Neo-Marxist traditions.
No one cares. 
 &gt;I know the difference exactly. 
No you don't. 


You've got some serious issues. 
 &gt;I say commie to make it clear that there is no place for socialism or communism in decentralization, 
This makes no sense. 


Good job mouthbreather, but that doesn't mean I was ever talking about bitcoin. In fact, simply reading the conversation thread makes this *painfully* obvious, just like it's *painfully* obvious that you're talking out of your ass.

Lol I said literally nothing about bitcoin or any other currency, fanboy. I'm just talking about socialism. Your inability to distinguish socialism and communism means this conversation isn't going to be worth my time, so run along.

Lmao can't even use poignant correctly in a sentence. A thesaurus is no substitute for intelligence. Don't bother replying, I've blocked you by the time you've read this.
