Economies of scale. Once you start doing your manufacturing in space without the need to launch materials and equipment, costs fall off quickly. Yes, there is a ludicrisly large up front investment but the possible gains are a thousand fold the cost, if not more. Will it happen in the next decade? Probably not, but in the next 50 years i would expect to see at least an industrial scouting/proof of concept mission and maybe a longer term, orbital ajust mission to bring an asteroid into a more favorable position for future mineing.

What about platinum, gold, iron and  helium?

Why are you hung up on this titanium on the moon? That is definatly not happening we have more titaium than we can use. Have you thought about spill over? Platium, gold and helium3 are partucularly rare and an increased supply would make a wide range of tech that otherwise would not be economical.

And the Jews had the last laugh, or at least a subset. If you can't beat them, join them.

I specificly said I did not expect any mission in the next ten years but i do expect at least one scouting/fesability/ orbital ajust mission in the next 50 years.  There are already at least two companjes planing prospecting missions

Of course rice isn't the best example since rice isnt really exported from china in any significant amount.
