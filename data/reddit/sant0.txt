Your story is extremely exaggerated. I think the percentage of money currently sitting in BTC that uses BTC the way your describing and thinks that BTC will be a fiat-like currency is a lot smaller than you believe.

My guess is that his BTC were just backlogged in GDAX’s system when bitcoin exploded a couple of weeks ago.

Hm this is weird. I was just in coinbase last night and made a deposit into GDAX.. Deposit is going to take a while to clear, but I'm definitely able to login.

Exactly, this is expected. I can't believe Trump hasn't talked about crypto yet..

You’re not considering opportunity cost. Yes you can spend your bitcoin today and trade it at an equivalent present value, but at what cost? If the price increases significantly, investment math would say you made the wrong decision. BTC won’t replace fiat currency similar to gold.

you should let us know what happens

my thoughts exactly

I haven't used it but I think that is where I will start
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:31:57
has a good explanation. 
Positive and negative news, among other things, can heavily impacts prices. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:52:36
this isn't physics, this is bitcoin...

You invested in a digital asset whose value is heavily based on speculation, what do you expect? Learn about the underlying technologies at play in the distributed ledger technology space, understand the blockchain associated with each coin before you put money into them, and understand that you're investing in the success of the coin, it's developers, and it's community.

I have also heard good things about Binance

Someone sounds angry.

I'd be interested in hearing the following people's opinions on Bitcoin: Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Elon Musk, and 2Chainz

He has a picture of himself as the background of his phone

Probably not worth investing $100 in BTC at this point based on fees. If you’re really interested in losing your money, you can buy on coinbase with Credit Card, which i hear foes through right away. Goodluck.

whales are in the market and their volume can significantly affect price.

who is this guy?
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:23:34
You can pay with debit or credit card for a fee. And yes, as you said, you will lock in the price at what you buy it at instead of having to wait for your money to clear.

sounds like you overdraft your account
