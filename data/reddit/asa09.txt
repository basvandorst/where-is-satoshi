The problem is بتكوين is already another arabic word, so بيتكوين with the stress on the 'I' is used to distinguish it. I know it doesn't read completely right but it's better than mixing keywords.

I've had great experience with them while in Beta...
@_date: 2014-10-07 23:55:34
Yeah they randomly stopped all my buys at a critical time this weekend, everyone else I talked to seemed to already have bought a bit from them before they started canceling/asking for further info (utility bill and something else...)
@_date: 2014-10-09 23:56:35
I am having the same issues, 
I am guessing for people who've bought a little more than the average they are asking all this, and probably only when they were short on coins during the drop (speculation, but that's my guess on their "problems" - which were reported to be fixed soon, only to be notified that it was their anti-fraud detection - BS)

They were discussing it over the git forums, but I have no control or private keys of my old wallets :/ and no proof...so I'm out 0.2 btc (granted it was cheap then)...really hoped to see an open source exchange happen.

I see, makes sense. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 05:55:41
Mt. Gox did the same. 
People were not withdrawing their BTC. 
Mt. Gox can't meet the real demand.
Mt. Gox sells GoxBTC
Mt. Gox collapses when people start withdrawing their GoxBTC (and the first ones to do this got all the RealBTC reserves) there wasn't enough RealBTC to back the GoxBTC - and so withdrawals were impossible. 
The GoxBTC in this story is the "paper" that claims Mt.Gox got RealBTC...
Exchanges should always prove reserves in an address where they give YOU the private key - a wallet shouldn't be just a web interface that says Balance: XXX because that just means "we owe you this much and you can withdraw it if we have it"

They are having a lot of problems, both with debit purchases and direct bank "instant" purchases. First they said they are working to fix it as soon as possible. And now they opted for the excuse of: "oh our fraud system is messing up, and we need your recent utility bills and photos of your ID" 
That's ridiculous. It was perfect before

Unfortunatly this is happening even in areas where bitcoin is still new. 
Here in the Gulf - Saudi/Dubai(UAE) - if you look up "bitcoin" in google, the first result is an investment company that lets you trade imaginary bitcoin with no ability to withdraw it. [Here's a screenshot](

What's the reward? Is it a private key?

I don't think MtGox lost it's coins, I think they were running on bitcoin-credit because they couldn't source real coins and sold fake bitcoins, that is until the price went down and they couldn't keep up with realBTC withdrawals.

The thief must have done some ingenious work though, to verify the 2fa and empty wallets automatically, I wonder if Coinbase's API helped him.
@_date: 2014-12-07 04:49:00
Where is this coming from?
I think this story has holes, I don't understand how the wallet could be created without being online to the website. 
When I do ANY modifications to my wallet, from creating a new address to deleting one, I get an immediate back up of the new wallet sent to my email as an attachment. Granted there's a hole here where if my email was unsecure I would lose my btc, but I have 2factor authentication on that. 
I'm surprised to see people experiencing this, I have had small issues with blockchain being off line or delayed sync with the bitcoin blockchain  (and real wallet balance) but I still prefer them over any other wallet, online or else. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:07:51
How do you tell a scam from a legitimate seller? just the fact that they're using paypal and 0 feedback? 
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:05:13
Works for me, guess it's back
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:54:41
But that guy has 30+ trades and 100% feedback, but I see he's selling for way too much. Plus it says "real name required". 
I sell on Localbitcoins (for cash), and quite often I sell more than the marketplace (maybe only 6-7% higher than bitstamp).  If you see an ad of someone selling bitcoin for cheaper than market value I'll be glad to buy it, because then I can sell it on an exchange, in person, or through coinbase for more.

Good for you, Don't be so quick to review though, wait until you buy a couple of coins before circle starts "investigating" you, a few online-friends and I have been asked to show utility bills, government IDs, extra info when our &lt;$300 trades wouldn't go through.

@_date: 2014-12-07 04:49:44
I've never heard of this happening before, in fact I'm very surprised, I recommend blockchain.info to a lot of people so this has me worried. 
When I do ANY modifications to my blockchain.info wallet, from creating a new address to deleting one, I get an immediate back up of the new wallet sent to my email as an attachment. Granted there's a hole here where if my email was unsecure I would lose my btc, but I have 2factor authentication on that.

Did you even count in the "Coinbase Fee" to your total bitcoin price? Circle has no fees but adds a small 0.X% on the price. They're just having a lot of issues now with the price decline. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 04:53:01
Thanks for the clarification, but let me clarify my concern
- Centralized exchanges move realBTC around when people trade? or only when they withdraw their coins out of the exchange? 
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:19:02
I noticed a few glitches with their graph as well, also 6 hours before they halted trading there were lags for several minutes in the 1-min price candles (bitcoin wisdom)
@_date: 2014-11-24 13:01:21
Doesn't this include the bitcoin trading bots? And the chinese bot volume? I think the opposite, not all of those transactions are real, especially if you consider the Gambling xyz-Dice sites that juggle bitcoins around and the organization of bitcoin storage in bitstamp and the other exchanges, what happens behind the scene at a lot of the bitcoin infrastructure today from offchain wallets to bitpay leads me to conclude that the transactions per day number is misleading. 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but moving bitcoins from address to address is the definition of a transaction? even if it's in the same wallet and user? sorry I sound grumpy but I wouldn't call it a "transaction" because that means something different. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:08:54
"1%" underestimates it, when you're talking about ~~12000~~ 130,000 BTC, or $60 Million USD of course it will have a significant impact. Though I doubt if an investment firm will dumps 60M USD in one moment.
Edit: correction.

You don't have to believe me but you're way off. I'm from here and I've smoked in several places here including SA and Dubai, but maybe I'm not as careful as you are so you do you man I'm not going to encourage risky behavior; smuggling is super risky worldwide but smoking pot in SA/Dubai is really not a big deal. I actually get more scared in the US because police are so hardcore and are actually out to get you.

The closest fact to this is Saudi Arabia, a different country, has the death penalty for smuggling drugs across international borders, a serious offense worldwide. The UAE is hard on "drugs" but they don't have any death penalty for smoking pot.

You use the professional OTC market 
(not the normal OTC peer to peer traders)
You don't publically state your desires and exact amounts unless you are intentionally trying to get a worse deal (will move the market). 
You make sure the company/OTC broker you are dealing with is compliant and will not scam you. 
You can be guaranteed that the seller will report your purchase to the proper channels, assume every single government entity will know about this, local or not. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:26:53
Many of these scenarios
Basically many many people were shorting bitcoin on leverage (margin) so when the price moved up against their direction the platform auto-bought the bitcoin to give back the loan. 
This is another twitter bot with the big margin calls

Placing an order like that on the public orderbook would move the market, though some people will view this as [spoofing]( If I need to buy with $100M for $7900 the price would move to $8000 before I manage to buy my remaining $95M...so I would not get a good deal. Therefore these type of orders are never done on exchanges because you can't get a good market price with that much money. Even $2M orders. These orders are done off exchanges with brokerages and fulfilled privately. Genesis, itBit, and other firms do this with minimum orders of 25 or 100+ BTC.

When the whitepaper for master coin was released it was titled "Bitcon's Second Whitepaper" that was my first red flag. Under what authority? For a centralized system to be publishing a personal project and calling it Bitcoin 2.0?
Also, no offense to colored coins, but I honestly only want client-side programs to deal directly with Bitcoin, no layers are necessary in my opinion. And if they are, won't they be included on the next Bitcoin client? We can find easier ways to get the general public to use it bitcoin without 3rd parties.

What do you use to accept Bitcoins? I guess from a technical perspective, how do you get your shipment address after you get paid and how do you know who paid and who didn't? 
Are you using Coinbase or Bitpay? Or just customer-to-customer basis?
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:58:46
I agree, I'm glad someone else sees it. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:57:48
Yes but do I need to make an address for each customer? I need a way to connect the payer to the shipping address and make sure that only after they paid that they can enter their shipping address. If I make people enter their bitcoin address maybe they'll be able to see the "from" address in blockchain.info 
I'm making it more complicated than it should be but I have trust issues haha

By not necessary, I mean I have no incentive for any of the features MasterCoin or Colored Coins purpose. Not implying they are a bad idea, they just don't fit my needs.

I recognize Bitcoin is volatile and has "unknown" behaviors and can go to could potentially crash, I never stated Bitcoin was safer than anything else, or I would have put my savings in it (I don't). My father didually did make most of it back, but most of what he was involved with is in an international market and never recovered. I'm just wondering what type of mutual funds actually get BTC results without equal amount of risk.  When the US stock market gets hurt, the whole world falls with it.

I get that Jobs was like that, but that's what brought the technology to the masses, working backwards from user interaction to technology.
If steve jobs was involved with Bitcoin, and he had no monetary benefit, one would not hear of bitcoin and not immediatly know how to use it. I tell my non-tech friends about bitcoin and they don't even know where to begin, let alone understand it. If we want something to appeal for the masses, we have to make it usable for the masses, even if they don't understand how it works, we have to make it a "norm". Making technology work in the background. 
Thought it's very understandable that Bitcoin is still technically beta
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:19:33
No, it can also be used to store part of your wealth freely. If I store my wealth in a bank I have to trust the bank, the government, the currency, and the world economy to keep it safe for me. I want my wealth in my own hands. Yes it is volatile now, but that's a risk I'm willing to take.

I don't think this statement was as remarkable as people make it seem. Either that or I don't get it. Bitcoin is still early, if it becomes mainstream and a world global currency we can ask the question again if cash is still "the best way". Let's wait and see how this plays out.

Don't take money from family you're not willing to lose, and if you saw there were games being played with Bitcoin when it had low volume why did you try other altcoins?

Let's be real? Things are more complicated then a pre-defined graph from your definition of a bubble. 
Business and websites will still use bitcoin. Bitcoin has been validated. It has been given the "OK" confirmation that it needed to be taken seriously and raised its price from pre-$100 levels. It won't fall back there because the same fundamentals are not gone. The only thing gone is that some Chinese businesses are no longer accepting bitcoin, and some Chinese users are therefor selling, everything else is a reaction. Yes price can go down further because fear creates fear, but the fundamentals of why the price went up, before the greed and delusion are there.
