Best experience... watching the price rise.... worst was trying to understand what it was. Pretty new to it but thing I'm slowly picking it up lol! Hopefully it will change my life for the good if I can achieve my goals!

Similar story... heard about it couple years back but thought nothing of it until looked into fundraising... still... they say it's best to learn the hard way!

I'm quite new to bitcoin, heard/read on internet that can fund raise with it, since then I've only noticed  One place in the UK that accept Bitcoin and that's CEX... if others catch on surely they would be on to a win win if they hold the bitcoin they receive. The price just seems to go up and up and if it is more commercial then surely it will only go higher?!! Maybe even PayPal should think about it, eBay payments are so common through PayPal. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:24:02
Agreed... probably not lol but then In there would lie the regret!

Could have done all of the above with a bitcoin wallet !! Will mass adoption ever happen ???

I don't know the legality of it as I'm a noob, but I didn't even think of the bank closing my account I don't trade Anyway so my bank isn't connected, I'm just trying to fundraise. I would have assume that the banks would be ok with it as tax office see bitcoin as taxable if trading (capital gains) or VAT is due if using bitcoin to buy/sell goods.

Fees in bread wallet are charged on the data size so if your wallet has received a good amount of small transactions the data size will be larger when sending from the wallet.
