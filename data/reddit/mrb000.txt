Not only it, I can provide too extended public key and I can use another exchanges as witnesses where I did KYC and have related operations
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:15:44
So you think that they don't resolve my problem because they don't want to loss their privacy? (they would be exposing their ownership)

@_date: 2019-05-22 05:56:12
at least your comment help to trending this topic, thank you
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:38:02
Then what do you expect? Maybe I could give the extended public key and prove that this is related to exchanges where I did KYC, I don't know what more I could give, operations with individuals could be testify too?
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:42:14
Okay after talking with redditors I understand that they aren't a thief , but is bad faith keeping my BTC instead give me it back
@_date: 2019-05-22 04:41:21
thank you!!!
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:42:37
I could prove it too, the extended public key has more addresses that are related to more operations and this operations come from or go to addresses of exchanges where I did KYC. I can have witnesses too.

I'm sorry, I replied it to another redditors yesterday. Now I edited the post with this part. Thank you
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:02:18
You understand, thank you!!
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:44:15
Okay I talked with another redditos, maybe isn't illegal . But I need my BTC back please , isn't good faith keeping something that isnt yours and giving it back costs you nothing
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:28:29
Is a Singapore based exchange

@_date: 2019-05-22 15:59:58
I edited the post adding how I mistakenly sent the BTC
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:58:08
Where I can find they telegram contact?
@_date: 2019-05-22 04:47:26
Even in my emails they offer me help and ask me my signatures. They ask me pay a fee. Why they do it if the address doesn't belongs to they? Support protocol? Maybe, but I don't think so
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:40:19
Okay I understand, I edited the post. Anyways, I think that they have to give me back my BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:59:00

I am not interested in debating whether or not it is an obligation, at least I want to appeal to the mercy of the CEO, just upvote please
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:05:27


what it does mean?

I read that singapore's legal is highly restrict and the sanctions are high.
@_date: 2019-05-22 04:41:57
I hope don't have to
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:23:16
thank you
@_date: 2019-05-22 04:46:06
Did you read my analysis? Is very probable that they owns the address.
You want to think they don't? Ok! Is possible, but unless they are directly related with the owner! I mean, WHO SENDS A LOT AMOUNT OF BITCOINS PERIODICALLY TO AN UNKOWN PERSON? ...
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:43:37
Thank you
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:22:28
I would agree pay a cost, I have no problem
Thank for your opinion

Please upvote it
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:40:43
Thanks you understand!
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:46:24
They could identify me, I have an extended public key and the operations within are related to exchanges where can be witnesses because I did the KYC process
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:17:18
It was a mistake, I work often sending and receiving big amounts of BTC.
When you a certain task all the days copying wrong data could be a **TERRIBLE** but **EASY** mistake to do, because we are humans and we fall in the trust. **As you did a task correctly many many times you earn trust on yourself and try save time.** If it didn't happens to you ever you aren't being honest.
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:57:03
Thank you for that information
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:16:39
1. I don't know what exactly happens , if was my mistake or a software error
2. Isn't science know that you are receiving 1 BTC from unknown person, it's a cold wallet. But okay I accept the possibility. I'm not random, I'm the owner of the keys which sent the 1 BTC, I'm providing signed messages.
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:27:22
The balances are directly related with Huobi, check my analysis. If they are not the owners, at least they have direct relation with the owner, they know him, then at least they could help me
@_date: 2019-05-22 18:40:32
Thanks it Will be useful
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:11:19
In every serious country it is illegal to stay with other people's things, even if they send it mistakenly.
We don't need to know what bitcoin is to know that it is illegal. They have the private key and/or the requested resources to giving my money back. Keeping my BTC is bad faith and is illegal.
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:44:53
thank you!!
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:07:40
I'm proving the ownership
@_date: 2019-05-22 04:36:52
I could be mad, I'm stupid... 
but "that wallet name is probably a scam" ???? what do you mean
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:54:44
I was sending to an exchange
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:23:42
Isn't the most good example but, if you walk on the street and find a bag with 1M USD, you can keep it? Is legal? Obviusly no and is worst if you know who is the person which lost it
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:19:35
I was checking a BTC rich list and exploring addresses. I copied the address from there.
After that I copied the address where I will send the BTC, but I don't know what went wrong and it sents to the first copied address.
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:24:28
I need sleep, thanks all you for the support, I will check later!!
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:11:48
Thanks all the support guys!
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:33:26
Okey, I'm not a lawyer anyways, Maybe isn't illegal and I understand your point
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:51:40
Thanks you, you understand!!!

You can go to Huobi, do a withdraw of USDT or BTC and probably with investigation you can see the relations between the wallets. 100% sure that if the huobi isn't the owner , they know the owner and they could help me.
They don't need to say "yes is my wallet i will send you it back to you" , they just need to send it back to me , i dont need to an official statement saying that they have the ownership
