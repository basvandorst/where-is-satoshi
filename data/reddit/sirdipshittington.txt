WOW, where can I sign up?! This is too good to be true. Can I invest my bit-coin in this?
I'd send along all of my 5BTC but I think my wallet is broken...
Can you help me by sending a test amount to see if the issue is on my end?
Here's my address: *1comboyNsev2ubWRbPZpxxNhghLfonzuN*

@_date: 2019-07-18 17:40:30
So, Ill make way more BTC taking over your contract than I would by simply buying and holding BTC right?
My BTC wallet seems to be broken, can you send me 1EUR worth of BTC to see if its working?
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:18:52
ya think?
Thanks though.
@_date: 2019-07-31 20:49:17
Yeah, these guy are ok. But over at AltaVista HyperCoin CCE, we have an algorerhythm that blows the tits off these low level coin goons' computer thinking stuff. No joke, we can double, even triple what those other guys offer. 
Interested? Of course you are. Simply DM me your private keys. Ill grab your coins and in a few short minutes you'll be rich.  You can pick out the colour of your lamob from 35000 feet in your private jet.

Man, I HATE the reddit mobile app. That's why I will forever hold on to my copy of Alien Blue. 
Sorry I haven't an answer for you, but know that I feel your pain.

Yeah sure, I know fake news when I see it!
@_date: 2019-07-31 20:20:04
Im gonna need a source for that.
@_date: 2019-03-07 23:30:25
Ha, no worries. Im not the other guy. 
A friend of mine runs a coffee shop, he was asking me the simplest way to go about accepting BTC (LN specifically as he had read an article somewhere about it). 
Ive messed around with BitcoinCore in the past but am in no position to offer competent BTC service/ advice.
I didnt have an answer for him. I do now. 
Thanks again. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 22:52:08
Agreed. But in a likelihood when (and if) mass adoption happens, a lot of people will want a service similar debit/ credit card machines. I doubt many will have the time/ inclination to learn how to set up their own LN payment systems. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 23:10:23
In your analogy, Id say Im a car owner, with zero mechanical skill. I want to take the car to a garage and have it repaired by a certified mech. 
In the same way that my local coffee shop likely doesn't really understand on a technical level how their debit machine works. . they just want to get paid for the goods they sell.

Me too actually. So,.. double plus dump then?
Also, there is no shame in pooping, most all people do it.

Au contraire, buddy:
1 mol of gold can be divided into 6.02214e23 individual gold atoms, whereas 1 BTC can only be divided into 100 000 000 satoshis. 
Mind you, its probably very easy to lose a couple gold atoms. 
Obviously, not as easy to transfer gold.
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:45:40
Why do you think this?

@_date: 2019-11-27 20:21:31
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:54:40
Depends, do you have enough BTC to move the market when you dump or pump?
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:23:34
Yeah, I agree. You are likely more of a gen x'er. However as an official gen x'er ('77) I dont feel like I should be a gen x'er as the dudes I know born in the mid 60's seem to be rather different in enough ways that they should not be in 'my generation'.  Id think the folks born somewhere between later 70's to late 80's should have their own generation as it is these folk whom I can relate to most regarding cultural things (music, vidz, social perspectives, etc).
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:15:53
Dude, are you in Spain? You totally should have gotten a lomo bocadillo.
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:12:22
If I understand your issue correctly:
I think you could just force-quit bitcoin core, then delete or move the data directory.
@_date: 2019-08-16 16:49:50
Did you try turning it off then back on again?
@_date: 2019-10-31 17:27:04
Bitcoin dont care.

huh, IIRC the bitcoin folder is hidden (/.bitcoin/\*). Try the following to show hidden files and folders:

Ok, thanks a million!
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:21:45
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:11:02
You could pick up an external drive (preferably a fast one) and move the bitcoin core data folder to the external drive.

Thanks for confirming my thoughts on Kraken and for the general advice!

For that sweet, sweet karma.
But seriously, I just read the note in my email,... thought it would be of interest to the r/bitcoin community.

So, you are saying that the price will go down? How do you know?
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:45:17
Yeah, Im not planning to put in any more than I can stand to lose. While I do see it as a high-tech lotto ticket in some ways, I also vaguely understand the underlying technology, and believe that it has the potential to grow and be used as a currency/ store of value in the not-too-distant future.

Top quality device without a doubt. I bought one back in 2006, it lasted until last year when I bought my second.

Ha, I guess everybody knows. Good luck to Kraken.

To join a mining pool, simply register at a pool. Follow their instructions on how to join their pool by pointing your mining hardware at their address.  
Obviously you need a miner and an internet connection.
