S2X ostensibly was the second half of the NYA compromise. At it's face, it would increase the blocksize to 2MB.  Once BCash forked off, the big blockers had an alternative and the remaining community was wary of increasing blocksize at this time.  S2X effectively would have fired the current development teams and given control of the Bitcoin brand to DCG companies.  Coinbase supported the failed S2X fork.  They are a DCG company.  So, theoretically, they should have been ready to implement Segwit at the time of the S2X fork (Late Nov).  Yet they now issue vague announcements promising Segwit as a lower-tier importance project with a goal of implementing sometime in 2018.
Coinbase is largely a bank, and is really only a short-term solution to obtaining crypto until it becomes more widely adopted.
Fact based unbiased resources?  No.  I'm afraid all I have I have gleaned from publicly released statements and reading others opinions.

Coinbase supported the Segwit2X takeover attempt, and is intentionally dragging its feet implementing vanilla Segwit.  So despite supporting Segwit2X months ago they can't implement vanilla Segwit?! It's fishy as heck.  Setting all that aside, the BCash rollout reeked of insider trading.

I think this is correct.... Coinbase is a little salty.  But they will get there.

*Nods head in agreement*
In an ideal world, crypto would "merely" grow at rates comparable to high performing stocks (say 15% per year).  The financial industry wouldn't be so alarmed.
It's when they see the price doubling in a few weeks that they freak out, and feel a need to generate a backlash.
Boil the frog.

I keep my portfolio balanced so I own not an equal dollar amount, but an equal percentage of the max coins.
So, a one in a millionth share of bitcoin is 2.1 coins.  A one in a millionth share of Litecoin is 8.4 coins.  A 1/4 ratio.
The dollar amounts will vary widely, but if you keep your crypto currency holdings stable compared to each other, well, that's good diversification in my book...

I don't understand how that could be.  according to   it's been about 3 days since the 10 sat/byte level was reached.
Are there miners intentionally mining transactions that have lower sat/byte than other tx's?
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:58:41
Consider the tax ramifications of short term buying/selling.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:50:12
70 sat/byte transactions cleared on the next block when you wrote this, and 30 sat/byte transactions cleared an hour after you posted.
What you wrote is factually incorrect.
By the way, 30 sat/byte *223 bytes * $10,000/BTC / 100000000sat = 67 cents for a single input transaction (not what OP has, I know)
67 cents to send any amount of money, anywhere in the world, faster than any bank in the world, without trusting any third party.

1% of the precious metals market?
1% of the fiat market?
1% of the remittance market?
1% of the payment networks market?
You do realize, that even at those modest numbers, that would put BTC an order of magnitude higher than it is now....
I suspect with that type of growth, BTC will actually become dominant in some of those markets, taking more than 50% of the transactions...
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:00:55

I will gladly pay $190 in fees if BTC was to reach $380,000/BTC.
That's trivial for the amount of gains.
However, with that said, I don't think it will reach that point.  Too high of fees will depress the price.  Once the scalability issues are solved, the price will then respond accordingly.

Whales would be unlikely to cash out in a single, dramatic sell order.

A vendor can see the tx posted (worldwide) typically within seconds.
You are probably confusing confirmations with what a vendor needs to be satisfied.
Maybe if one was making a large purchase they would want to wait for a confirmation..... but day to day, no.
Fees are under $4 right now.  Not ideal, but I am confident that this is being addressed.  The network is just so darn popular that demand is exceeding space right now.  Really, that's a good problem to have.

It does not require enormous amounts of electricity.  One single miner center could easily process all the transactions worldwide.
There are many miners, duplicating efforts, because it is so profitable.  (and because decentralization is an asset) However, it is not necessary.
Besides, Bitcoin mining, even at current energy expenditure, is much more efficient than the worldwide energy usage of financial data warehouses, fiat production or gold/silver mining.  Bitcoin could dramatically help cut down on the amount of energy required to support our current financial system.

Mining _increases_ the supply.  Price would experience increasing upward pressure if the supply was lessened due to mining.
Basically, right now X coins are produced.  Assuming the miners sell all of what they produce, before the price can increase, those X have to be purchased first.  X is getting smaller every four years. In2033 X will be almost negligibly small. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:59:24
Segwit2X is dead.
Segwit is already available on many wallets (not all)
If a user sends from a segwit wallet to a segwit wallet, the size (and therefore fees) are much smaller.
You'll have to do a one time transfer from a non-segwit wallet to a segwit wallet if you haven't done so already.

@_date: 2017-12-25 14:13:53
Let's say you bought 1 BTC in January for $1000
In Febuary you traded 1 BTC for 20 Altcoin
In March, your altcoin outperformed bitcoin, and you traded 20 Altcoin for 1.5 BTC (Though BTC also went up)
In April, you lost your goddamn mind and decided to sell BTC.  You sell your 1.5 BTC for $3000
So, in this scenario, your overall gains might _seem_ to be easy to calculate.  Your capital gains are $3000-$1000, and you pay tax on the $2000 gains.
However, what muddies the water is when did you earn those gains?  What would happen if some of those transactions were in one tax year, and some in another?  What if you spent some of those altcoins directly?
So, the way the IRS looks at it, is each altcoin exchange is a purchase.  You have to calculate the equivalent purchase price at each step along the way and calculate the gains.
It's not right, and it's way too cumbersome to the individual, but that's the way it is right now.  And the IRS is absolutely watching with greedy eyes.  If you are trading on an exchange, I guarantee they have the ability to get your trade history.
Companies have been bartering goods services directly for a long time to avoid the taxman.  A auto shop might give an office supply company free oil changes in exchange for paper and pens.  But the IRS is clear... what they are supposed to be doing is reporting the cash equivalent value of those oil changes/paper pens.  Of course, no one does.  However, it's a hell of a lot easier for the IRS to figure it out when everything you are exchanging is recorded in one company (a crypto-exchange) for them.
It is only a matter of time before the IRS really starts taking a bite out of the crypto market.  Too much money being made to ignore now.

Facts suggest otherwise.  In fact, to date, the vast MAJORITY of fiat drop to zero....    You can't cherry pick the two or three longest lived currencies as your example (Dollar/Euro/GBP)...that isn't the experience of the majority of people on the planet.
and 100% of fiat drops over time... Please name one fiat issued more than 10 years ago that hasn't lost value over time.
Your claim that you think fiat is backed by real people/power is ...misguided.  Fiat is no stronger than the country it is based in, and no more stable than the lack of corruption in its leaders.  I'm old enough to have seen governments fail and currencies die.
I'll take mathematics over the word of a politician, thank you very much.  What you see as a disadvantage "there is no one and nothing backing it" I see as a strength... it doesn't rely on anyone _to_ back it.

Maybe.  I'm not super educated about other coins.
Branding and market recognition play a greater role than actual performance at this point in time.
The marketplace is littered with companies that had a superior product but lost out due to lack of recognition.
I am intrigued by the idea of smart contracts though.  If that could be done securely, that's amazing.

How is the cost basis calculated...
Say I make 12 purchases for $100 each, but at different amounts.  Each of those accumulates value.  Then I withdraw my orinal investment of $1200.  What is the cost basis?  
And what about exchange fees and/or transfer fees?  Are those deducted from my gains?

I'm diversified across many cryptos, including Ethereum.  I don't think cryptos are an either/or proposition.
See: Andreas Antonopolous Lion/Shark discussion.  Each have their own unique strengths.
But I have a very long position, at least until the next halvening.
I suspect that many cryptos are going to do well, and be used in a variety of ways.  And in the timescale that I plan to be holding, problems with scale will certainly be remedied.
I think the best analogy is the dial up days of the internet.  It was exceptionally frustrating, and difficult to use.  But everyone knew that was a transition stage (or, at least they should have known).
HTTP isn't the best internet protocol, either.  However, it was the one the world coalesced around.  I think Bitcoin is in a similar position.

I have better things to do than learn the nuances of 10,000 pretenders to the throne.
Right now, BTC has 60% of the market share, and no other coin has even a share of the public interest.  Maybe I'll take a look if some coin captures even 33% market share...
I think Bitcoin will be able to resolve scaling issues far faster than an altcoin will be able to capture the public's attention.
Besides, if BTC fails, the public will be jaundiced indeed toward any new coins...it will set crypto back years.

In addition to 's (correct) comment, the vast, vast majority of energy expanded in mining is done to solve a (intentionally difficult) math problem.  The only way to solve it is by guessing the answer.  Miners guess one answer after another very quickly.  If they are the first, they get the block reward, which is the vast majority of the reward they get.  They also include transactions in their "proof" of solving the problem (for a much smaller reward).  The important thing to understand is that a miner is rewarded for doing that work...the work itself is _intentional_ in order to prove the legitimacy of the entries they are adding to the blockchain.  However, it is not much work (power) to include the transactions...that is trivial compared to the difficult math problem.  A miner would be rewarded even if there were no transactions to process in a given block!

A tool can be used for many purposes.  What is one man's hammer is another man's weapon.  The fact a tool can be used to create or destroy rests entirely upon the user, not the thing itself.
Environmentally costly I'm not sure about.  It's easy to say that physical banking infrastructure is more costly, but crypto is a new creation.  I think proof of stake systems can make that issue moot, however.

in the last 24 hours, transactions of 25 sat/byte were confirmed.
25 sat/byte * 223 bytes * $10,000 per BTC / 100000000 sat * 0.84 Euro/dollar = 0.46 Euro.
You are overpaying.  Maybe you are not setting your wallet fee appropriately.
Besides, .001 btc is trivial, for the same price you can send massive quatities.  Sending a 100 BTC for .46 Euro in fees is quite a deal, no?  Also considering that it is peer to peer with no banks involved, and far faster than any bank can perform internationally....

I believe that credit card companies will resist allowing discounts for crypto.  Currently, they don't allow companies to  charge more for using credit cards.  Some merchants (gas stations) get around this by offering a cash discount, but that is a gray area because it isn't popular to carry that much cash.  If/when crypto gets big, I expect the credit card companies to write in their merchant terms of service that the customer pays the same price regardless of payment method.  Merchants that discount crypto will be called in breach of their credit card terms of service.

The difference of course being:
A) one can set their own tx rate, so 1000 sat/byte is overpaying (if you are too stupid to know how to do that, that's on you)
B) I didn't cherry pick numbers, I used the rate of 140 sat byte given the constraints that I wanted the tx to go through in the next 24 hours. At multiple points in the day, 140 sat/byte was getting included in the very next block.  (IE, 10 minutes!)  As I type this, even non segwit tx's of less than 120 sat/byte are being approved in the next block, bringing the price per tx down to less than $4.

Mining is mobile, and power is currently being untapped.
So, a given region is expected to grow...  (say, China) but the demand for power is not yet there.  But the power plant can be built to meet the expected demand, and mining can quickly move in to the area with the cheap power.  By the time real demand moves in, the miners will be priced out of the area.
Mining makes use of power that is wasted anyhow.  Surplus power from hydro or solar.
Some think that crypto mining is exaclty what is needed to bring the cost of renewable energy down.

One of the first lessons you learn is how to withdraw without getting hit with those fees.

Let's analyze your claim.
Let's presume Fedex delivers in 24 hours.  Not realistic over long distances, but we'll use that as a starting point.
In the last 24 hours tx's of less than 140 sat/byte were getting confirmed.  Source:   So, at several points in the past 24 hours, 140 sat/byte got your tx into the very next block.
We'll use an average BTC price of $16,000 for easy math.
So: 140 sat/byte * 223 bytes (simple tx) * 100000000 sat * $16000/BTC = $4.99
Now, I'm no expert on Fedex, but I would be shocked indeed if Fedex were delivering packages worldwide overnight for $4.99.  Plus, you are trusting that your package won't be intercepted/read.
Your claim has been demonstrated inaccurate.

Let's say it's 8 digits...
1 digit is anything
2 digit has a (10-1)/10 chance of not repeating 0.9
3 digit has a (10-2)/10 chance of not repeating 0.8

Think of it this way....  BTC has some characteristics similar to a commodity.
Now, what are commodities? Commodities are agricultural products... like coffee that you had for breakfast... wheat, which is used to make bread... pork bellies, which is used to make bacon, which you might find in a 'bacon, lettuce and tomato' sandwich.
And then there are other commodities, like frozen orange juice... and gold. Though, of course, gold doesn't grow on trees like oranges.
Clear so far?
Now imagine if, say, a big freeze hurts the production of oranges, and suddenly there was 50% less orange production.  The price of oranges would increase dramatically.
With bitcoin, it's a bit different, because everyone already _knows_ the date of the "big freeze", so the effect tends to be more muted and more drawn out over time...  but it is still there.

Cost of mining will not instantly double, the reward for mining will decrease by slighly less than half (don't forget tx fees).

And I can hear the response now: "b.b.b.b uuutt they convert it to fiat"  No doubt.  But the point is, they accepted all those methods to settle the tax debt.  What they do with it after that point is their business.

Here's a use case for where bitcoin mining drives plant construction.
Small town is expected to grow.  The town can build a small coal plant, which exactly meets their needs.  But later on, as the town grows, it won't meet their needs and they'll need to keep incrementally adding power plants.
Or, they could opt for a large project (like a dam).  Problem is, that produces so much power they don't need it all.  And power can only be transported so far efficiently.
But miners are portable.  They can setup next to the small town, and purchase the cheap excess power.  As the town grows, the price of power goes up, and the miners get phased out and move to cheaper locations.  Big town is left with a dam that supplies their needs they might not have been able to afford otherwise.
This exact scenario is why so many power companies are investing in mining operations.  Mining produces a portable method (on the timescale of 2-3 years) of producing a consumer for inexpensive power that might otherwise have been wasted.

@_date: 2018-05-31 13:12:44
Everything you said is correct, and I'm not disagreeing with you.
But the layperson needs to understand that power cannot be transported long distances efficiently...  as distance increases, there is inevitable loss, and at sufficient distance, the loss becomes so high that it's more efficient to have local power production closer to the consumer.
I suspect this is less of an issue in Europe than it is in the vast distances of the US.  This is borne out by locations of mining centers... they are not in densely populated Europe; they are clustered around (hydro and geothermal) production in less populated areas ...Chinese hydro plants, Columbia River hydro plants for example)
My main point is that mining provides a ready made and portable consumer for power in situations where the power production is in excess for the local demand.

In addition to the reasons mentioned earlier... it takes an active movement to transfer to a segwit address.  So it might just be easier to stay the course.  Human nature being what it is, some users might just choose to do nothing until the benefit reaches a critical point....  a _small_ benefit might just not be worth the extra time/research involved.
Also, the transaction to _move_ to a segwit address is not a segwit transaction itself.

Similar with stocks and other commodities...
What you are noticing is the spread between buy and sell orders.  This is to be expected.
did you know you can put in an order and "name your price" for purchasing/selling BTC?  If you have a coinbase account, you have a GDAX account.
No fee if you place a buy or sell order and no tx fee to xfer to your own wallet.

ok, let's just agree to disagree.  I am not going to try to convince you.
I do agree that for high dollar amounts (as this appears to be) it might be wise to get a confirmation.  
But for the vast majority of transactions (like my weekly sub purchase) the merchant does not need to wait for a confirmation... the risk is small.  Not zero, but small.

All _fiat_ money.
Think of it this way... fiat used to be "backed" by a physical commodity (Silver or Gold, typically).
A dollar was nothing more than an IOU for an amount of that commodity...  paper was easier to denominate than shaving off a few grams of gold.
Eventually, enough people trusted that the IOU's had value that they stopped being backed by anything other than faith....  but the IOU's are still just that....  an IOU...  a debt...
Bitcoin is more like a commodity... there can only be so much of it.    More cannot be printed or created (except by the mining process which is set to ever get closer to a fixed limit)

Correct.  The reason the halving isn't exactly 4 years is because more hashrate is coming online.  The difficulty adjusts upward to compensate, but there is a slight lag between the two, hence the approximation of 4 years is never quite reached.

That's a misconception.
A)Fluctuations, by definition, are favorable 50% of the time.
B)You only see fluctions on short time frames...  a longer time axis smoothes those out (into a growth curve)
B) Even if fluctuations continued, there is still use...  BTC is permissionless, peer to peer, pseudoanonymous, and censorship resistant.  Those qualities (and others) have value to many.

I don't agree.  While a million dollar order might swamp an individual exchange, the market itself would be able to eat it for any one of those commodities.  And if you were selling a large amount, one wouldn't likely liquidate entirely at once and entirely at one exchange exactly to avoid moving the price.  Even if you dumped a million on GDAX as an immediate market sell, it would just drop the price to $4380 as of this moment.  Barely a blip, considering the other exchanges would be unaffected and arbitrage would quickly compensate.

Short answer:  Hal Finney
Long answer: A great question.  Depends on how you define create.   
Bitcoin is created by tens of thousands of people in a process called mining.  New bitcoin are created when miners successfully solve an intentionally difficult math problem and in the process they confirm the transactions on the network.  So, anyone who wants to mine is a creator.
Or, maybe you might mean the person who first conceived of using a solution to the (previously unsolved) Byzantine Generals problem as a way to create an unforgeable electronic cash system.  The author of that paper used the pen name Satoshi Nakamoto.  If you could conclusively identify who that person was, you'd answer a mystery that has gone on for several years.  Hal Finney (an early developer) seems as likely a candidate as any other.
Part of the genius of BTC is that it is decentralized...meaning no one person owns it (or even creates it).  This eliminates a point of failure, since a decentralized coin cannot be attacked by silencing any one individual or organization.

miners will be rewarded with 6.25 coins per block instead of 12.5

TX Malleability might be solved other ways (I don't know) but it's solved on BTC with Segwit.  That is one feature (among many) of Segwit.

Fact is, the government will have to rely more on taxes collected on the sale and purchase of goods and services, and less on taxes on income / capital gains if they lose control of the money supply.
And that's a good thing, in my opinion.  The same amount of taxes can still be collected (we'll have to get used to seeing Federal Sales Tax), but it will all be on the consumption side.
It could even be progressive:  Tax on food is a paltry 1%, tax on Yachts is a whopping 65%, for example...

Wealthy, powerful and influential people will own some BTC.  They won't want to see their investment ruined.
They also (perhaps more than the layperson) want the ability to move funds without being under control of the government...or at the whim (and expense) of the banking system.
IE, the benefits of bitcoin (decentralized, borderless, pseudo-anonymous, cheap and fast) also benefit them.
Ask your friend... does the ability to quietly move millions of dollars for the cost of a cup of coffee anywhere in the world without permission benefit the average person or the rich and powerful more?  If the answer is the latter, won't they attempt to protect that ability?

oh, yes, you might have to pay capital gains on the transaction fee itself (say 15% of the $2.50 that coinbase charges)....  but not the whole amount.  And that is _only_ if you pay your transaction fee in btc.
So yes, the transaction fee is paying btc for a service (to move the coins), so the fee itself is taxable.  But you don't pay tax on the amount you moved.
What's nuts is even more than that, you'd have to calculate the _gains_ on that transaction fee:
You originally bought 3 BTC at $3500.  Today it is $7000.  You decide to move to your wallet today, instead of immediately after purchasing.  (Silly you).    So, you move your 3 BTC off the exchange, and are charged .000286 BTC.  2.999714 BTC makes it to your wallet.  But that .000286 BTC didn't start off valued at $7000/BTC....  only the _gains_ are taxed.   That two dollar fee is actually a _gain_ of one dollar.  If you had kept it more than a year, the gains tax is 15% of one dollar = 15cents.   If you kept it less than a year, the gains tax is equal to your highest marginal tax rate....  say, 35% if you are relatively wealthy.  That equals 35 cents.
So, yes, technically one should report that 15-30 cents as capital gains taxes, but I suspect the taxman is much, much more concerned when that main amount of 2.999 BTC is converted to a car/boat/cash/....
If one was to spend the balance of your holdings on services, yes, that would be taxable too....
Note, this is how the law looks at BTC today, in the US.  Other countries do away with such silly things as long term capital gains....

no, not much benefit in exchange diversification....
You'll have to go through an identification process that is rather intrusive, in my opinion.  Though some exchanges let you purchase small amounts without that identification.
the benefit to signing up to more than one exchange is you can compare the differences in price between the exchanges, and purchase whichever has the best rate at the time you buy.  In my experience, the difference has been small compared to the rate at which BTC grows.

BCH cannot and will not be able to handle the famed "Visa-level" transaction volume.  They will continue to need bigger and bigger blocks until each block is Gb in size.

Looks like production is increasing every year with the exception of the year that the Taliban was publicly beheading farmers in 2001.  I certainly don't condone public beheadings.
So, if in your opinion the US invasion of Afghanistan was an effort to increase Poppy production, it seems it was successful.  How exactly did US decisionmakers profit?  Why would there be other nations participating in the invasion?
I maintain that Poppy production increased as a result of the US being neutral to the production, and local farmers looking to create a profit however possible.  I would venture that crop production of all sorts also increased post-taliban. (Marijuana, coffee, food crops, etc).

I'm not an expert, just a layperson, so take what I say as uneducated.  But my understanding of the lightning network is that it allows multiple transactions to be bundled and settled all at once.
So, you could open a channel with your friend.  He pays you X, you pay him Y, he pays you Z.  This is all off-chain.  If either one of you want to settle up, either one can close the channel and X-Y+Z is calculated and the final amount is settled on chain.  Especially useful for lots of small, recurring transactions.

Yes, that makes sense.  I just find it unlikely that investors would bet on a new coin to overtake BTC.

You were likely banned for promoting a specific brand (in this case bitcoin) rather than a more general asset class (for example cryptocurrency)
You broke the rules that are clearly explained, you deserved to be banned.
It would be no different if I told a user to buy Ford stock or invest in Google, rather than automotive or tech stocks.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:09:48
I ran into the same issue; a desire for a balanced portfolio required ever increasing purchases of (flat) altcoins to keep up with BTC growth.  I would never sell any (to avoid a capital gains).  
I've given up on altcoins for that reason...   Still hold them, but no more investments... and my BTC ratio continues to grow and grow....

"That's people that are already rich. Large holders of a deflationary currency will get richer just by holding it. In an inflationary world the opposite is true; it loses its value."
Correct.  Which is why given the choice I'd rather see a deflationary system.  I mean, ideally everything would be static, but since I have no debts and have accumulated assets, deflation is my preferred side.

Fees as low as 50 sat/byte were approved within an hour of your post.
50 sat/byte * 223 bytes (simple tx)* $10750 /100000000sat = $1.20
$1.20 to send any amount of money to whoever you want in the world without involving any bank.
That is cheap.

Not true.  Even a modest $15% discount on a $25 purchase would more than offset a tx fee as high as 140 sat/byte, which is more than enough to get confirmed in the very next block.

By the time bitcoin reaches a million, there will be plenty of improvements; in fact, I dare say bitcoin will not reach a million until those improvements are in place.
Right now, for example, wallets are working on implementing the Segwit protocol....  once that is mainstream (it's around 12% usage now) the number of transactions per block goes up dramatically....  then LN on top of that....  and other improvements down the road from there, too....

Rational actors are purchasing BTC ahead of the fork, largely funded by selling other cryptos.  Notice the precipitous drop on other currencies rates.
I suspect post fork many investors will chose their side and sell the side they think will be less valuable in the long term, and then return their funds back into altcoins.  That's just my uneducated opinion, of course.

If you never convert the BTC to anything (fiat, goods, or services) there is no gains to tax.
In the US, tax only comes into play when a conversion is done.  Also noteworthy:  short term capital gains (less than 1 year) are taxed at a lower rate than long term.  At the _very_ least, everyone (in the US) should be holding for at least 1 year.

I agree capitalism _in the extreme_ is to be avoided, but I am comfortable with more capitalism than we have today.  I want a smaller government with fewer services in exchange for lower taxes.  Not necessarily zero, just less.  Even more than that, I want smaller Federal government, in exchange for more local/state government.  Bring the tax dollars closer to home for even more accountability to the taxpayer.

Trade, perhaps....But maybe not spell.  ;-)  I jest.
&lt;shrug&gt;  I have no doubt that short term spikes and drops can earn an individual some gains, if one was a trader.  But I'm not a trader, and BTC is not a long term store of value.
Sure, if you could sniff out the Aug 16-19 spike, or the Oct 27-Nov 3 runup, of course....  but those are cherry-picked dates.  I know I lack the knowledge for that sort of prognostication.  I'm just a simple hodler.

As a result of some law changes, individual states in the US permit this before.
Before it was only a "cash discount".  Now merchants are expressly allowed to charge more for CC use.

This implies, on average (with a fee sufficient for next block status) waiting 4.5 mins for confirmation....
Also, obligatory note... unless you are making a very large transaction (like real estate or a car) merchants aren't going to make you wait for a confirmation... posting the transaction is sufficient to complete the purchase.

It's a relatively recent development; I posted the article that discusses the court case a few weeks ago.  It's been relegated to a state by state issue now, but the tide is definitely shifting more to towards empowering the merchant to set their rules.

I find it most common with govt agencies in the US.

This is why the recent court decisions regarding credit cards is so important... merchants are fighting the credit cards for the right to add a surcharge to credit card users.  (In the US, merchant credit card fees are astronomical).  This plays right into Bitcoin's hand, as BTC is free to the merchant and will be treated like cash...  (surcharge free)
So, while BTC might not get a discount, credit card use will get a surcharge.

Say only half the people are interested... that's an investment of $82....
Say only 10% of people are interested...that's an investment of $410 per person to soak up that supply.  
If only 5% (a figure I think is reasonable right now), that's a lifetime investment of $820 to soak up new supply.
Additionally, you have all the people already living on the planet... not just the ones who are born/come of age.

@_date: 2018-03-22 18:05:51
It is true that mining is... for lack of a better word, mobile.
When the price of energy rises too high in one region, miners there merely let their equipment become obsolete until it is no longer profitable to mine, and they put their best equipment somewhere else.
This is not entirely bad.  Imagine a situation where a government knows that power is going to be needed in the future...   For example a town is expected to grow.  The government permits building the infrastructure for a larger (and more efficient) plant now, even though only a small fraction will be used locally.  The excess power can be sold to mining at a discounted rate.  As the local demand grows, the discounted mining power is weaned off.....  It is win/win:  The miners get cheap power (for a limited time) and the community gets the ability to expand infrastructure ahead of demand without leaving expensive equipment idle.
It can also be a solution in the reverse... imagine a community that permitted the building of a large power generation plant, but the demand never increased.   Now there is a plant capable of producing cheap power, but it is difficult to send that power long distance.  Miners can move in and soak up that excess relatively rapidly, providing the power plant the needed customers to justify their expenses.
I could see a future in which power producers and miners are very closely related, communicating their plans to each other for mutual benefit.
@_date: 2018-03-04 08:22:40
I'll take your word on that... 
It's certainly not common in the US.   Merchants that do surcharge for cc usage are definitely outliers.  Right now it's legal in about a dozen states, but it's expanding....
In the EU CC Merchant fees are regulated much lower as well.  In the US merchant fees are often 10 cents plus 3-6% of the tx.  I'm not surprised merchants would fight being compelled to eat that by the cc's.
Not sure what is right.... I don't see any reason why the State should get involved in whether or not a merchant can surchage for using a credit card... that seems entirely an issue between the cards and the merchants.  As long as the policy is clearly posted and the consumer is informed, I see no reason for the State to have an opinion one way or another.
In any case, the tide in the US is definitely moving towards penalizing cc usage and favoring debit/cash... and crypto.  :-)

Not random, I select the amount.
I will agree there is volatility.  That's to be expected in something as early in development as BTC is.
Transaction fees are around two cents right now.  Better than any other form of transfer with the exception of cash.

@_date: 2018-02-18 05:45:53
Like right now.  2 satoshi/byte tx's are confirming on the next block.  That represents about 4 cents for a standard transaction.
If one compares it to the minimum fees that credit cards charge (10 cents, and 3% of the purchase), it's been under that amount for several weeks now.....
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:48:39
First off, douchnozzle, I'm well aware how many countries there are outside of the US.  You assume too much.
I never claimed India to be a shithole, but since that's apparently where you hail from, I'll have to agree with your assessment.
The point is, I picked a TOTALLY ARBITRARY small amount.  That's my threshold, not yours.  Your attack is misplaced and smacks of insecurity....  some British lord impregnate your grandma or something?
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:32:12
That's a fair observation.  The worker at the deli didn't know very much, and I pretty much had to show _her_ how to receive a payment.  I suppose someone unethical could do that, but I'm sure merchants would probably have their own policies created to set minimums if this ever became a problem.   Much like merchants currently have minimum credit card purchases to offset the 10 cent per transaction minimum.  In fact, I could see merchants setting a 5 sat/byte minimum fee for exactly the same reasons.  Which, I note, is basically getting confirmed in the next block right now.
I think LN will handle small tx's, and the future will be on-chain for large purchases... like things that have titles: Land, Car, Boat, etc. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:12:57
Likely.  I also noticed that many of those wallets haven't moved before the split with BCH.  One might think they'd have separated the two with potentially so much profit on the line...
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:55:41
No... another way a correction could go is sideways for X days/weeks/months.... 
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:16:31
Maybe.  It could also confirm on the next block.
Here's what's going on in the mempool, for those that want to educate themselves:
You'll see that 1 sat/byte tx's are the only tx with any sort of backlog at all, and they are still getting confirmed.
If you are willing to go to just 2 sat/byte, (that's still less than 5 cents), there is no time in the last 3 weeks it hasn't confirmed within a few hours.
In either case, compare that to traditional credit cards.  A $10 purchase charges the merchant 10 cents plus 3%... that's 40 cents.  And it takes a month for it to confirm on the cc network.
Are you really so poor that you can't afford 5 cents?  For borderless, decentralized, permissionless, semi-anonymous transactions?  I think that is a heck of a good deal!

"Still, even supporters acknowledge that that glorious future is going to use a lot of electricity. It’s true that many of the more alarming claims—for example, that by 2020, bitcoin mining will consume “as much electricity as the entire world does today,” as the environmental website Grist recently suggested—are ridiculous: Even if the current bitcoin load grew a hundredfold, it would still represent less than 2 percent of total global power consumption. (And for comparison, even the high-end estimates of bitcoin’s total current power consumption are still less than 6 percent of the power consumed by the world’s banking sector.)"

Visa does not clear within a few seconds.  They merely post their transaction in a few seconds, just like BTC.

CC transactions are only finalized after 30+days.  This is how chargebacks happen.  Less merchant risk with BTC.

Lol, if only that were true.  Merchants routinely get screwed by chargebacks.  Few bother keeping all the records necessary to overcome those chargebacks.
In fact, you likely have _less_ time with BTC.  From as few as 10 minutes to whatever the fee level selected permits.  I suspect merchants will set minimum fee levels eventually.  But they'll also offer discounts since they won't have the corresponding chargeback risk.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:51:17
Well, since the transaction costs right now are under 10 satoshi/byte (about 18 cents).  I'm willing to donate 18 cents to improve the bitcoin network.  But, to directly answer your question, just a few weeks ago transactions were 140sat/byte plus, so that's a bit under $2.80.   So, if sending via segwit you save even 10% off of that, you'll be in the plus.
But seriously, xfer to segwit... it's good for the nework in the long run and for most people 18 cents is a trivial amount.

You guessed wrong.  I hail from the vicinity around Detroit.  My local bitcoin meetup goes to different BTC-accepting places every week.  Detroit area isn't exactly the tech-experiment mecca, friend.  These are all mom-and pop restaurants....  and that's not even counting the online orders, the smoke shops...  I even saw the landscaping company near me put up a BTC sign.


Really? Tell that to an online merchant.
Sure, I am invested in BTC for speculative reasons, but also because I _want_ the tech to survive.  That's more why I spend at the restaurants... I want to encourage those merchants.  But I replace what I spend because I believe the long term outlook for BTC is bright.

Or, and I'm just spitballing here, they accept BTC because the owner wants to accumulate more...

I don't care the reason that they accept it, I just want to encourage more and more places _to_ accept it.
They absolutely wouldn't have my business if they didn't accept BTC, so it's income they earned that they wouldn't have had elsewise.

Suppose some person puts in a tx with a sat/byte of 1000.  That will push the average way up.  But a 5 sat/byte fee more often than not will also get included in the next block lately.  Sortof like when Bill Gates enters the room, on average everyone is a millionaire.  Better to use minimums or perhaps medians instead of average for this sort of examination.

I think that exchanges are using more batching, which explains simultaneously both why tx's are down and ave size is up.  I don't have any proof of that, other than individual exchanges press releases saying they are implementing batching.  
Unfortunately I don't have  data on number of outputs, I think that might be a more useful metric in terms of measuring btc usage than tx's.
And I'm not going to compare to 500k tx's per day, because that is clearly the ATH; that's cherry-picked data.  I think the state of the network at the time of this discussion is most relevant.  
When I buy a sub at my local deli, it's a 1 input, 2 output 230byte tx.  That's a typical, consumer-level purchase comparable to a cc transaction.
Also, looking at your source, I see how they are getting those averages....  They are saying... ok, for this block, look at all the tx's that this was their first available block.  What is their average?  Of course people (and exchanges) can and _routinely_ do overpay.  But as an individual, I can still get in the next block (if that was important) for much lower than the average.  If Bill Gates walks into a room, on average everyone there is a millionaire.  When discussing BTC fees, lowest possible or perhaps median is much more useful than average.  We all know wallet software can do a better job of estimating fees.

Credit card companies lost that case.  It is now legal on a state by state basis.  I posted the relevent case several weeks ago and have seen merchants citing the case and adding surcharges now for cc use.

I'm not opposed to increasing the blocksize in principal.  But it must be constrained to be small enough that an average joe can run a node, so it must be limited to cheaply accessible hardware/network throughput.  So blocksize increase will effectively be limited to the rate at which the average joe's technology improves.  If BTC grows like we hope it will, the blocksize increase won't be able to keep up.  Node centralization must be avoided.  BCH is starting down a road that will end in centralization, and all the censorship and control issues that come with it.

Merchants are willing to take that theoretical risk, in my experience.
I have never once waited for a confirmation at any merchant I have dealt with (except online merchants).
This makes sense... with online merchants, waiting for a confirmation is an insignificant delay.  Wheras paying at a brick and mortar, they take the risk to keep the register line moving.
Merchants don't wait for confirmations from normal credit cards, either.

No, I don't want a society where only the rich can succeed... that's again your projection.
I do want people to take less loans and borrowing, period.  I think living within one's means can do that.
An 18 year old kid armed with only good health and a high school diploma can pay their own way through college without a single loan.
Fact is, most people are too lazy, picky, risk adverse, or stupid to help improve themselves.  That's ok, they don't have to.  They can survive just fine on the minimums already provided by the hard-working members of society.

I don't accept those numbers.  Let's look at the data:
I see 2 sat/byte tx's are confirming (5 times in the last 2 hours) that's 4 cents for a typical 1 in, 2 out transaction.  So those are making it through, albeit slowly.
Everything 10 sat/byte and up is confirming on the very next block. That's less than 20 cents. 
For comparison: In the US, a typical credit card merchant fee is 10 cents, plus 3%.  So, for a $10 purchase, that's 40 cents....  I don't particularly like comparing to cc's though, because that is a centralized system that requires trust and permission to transact.

Ooh, that's a big discussion beyond the scope of picking a wallet.
  In a nutshell, 2X is an upcoming hard fork (in November) that purportedly has the goal of honoring an agreement made several months ago.  However, once bitcoin cash split off, many question the need for such a fork.  Even more concerning is the lack of developer support for this fork.  It's highly political, and many believe that 2X is more about control of the bitcoin "brand" than any functional changes.  This forum is decidedly against the 2X fork, though other differences of opinion exist.  Segwit is a change to bitcoin that enables more efficient packaging of transactions.  It is mostly non-controversial, except for some miners who split off to form Bitcoin Cash.
That's a really, really short summary.  This forum will disuss that topic endlessly between now and the November fork.

Oy, for an IT guy, this article misses the mark.  Many blockchains are publicly readable, so using them for ID's, while techtnically possible, isn't a primary use case.  Secondly, the whole point of a blockchain is that invalid transactions are ignored by consensus rules.  Once can't simply hack a block, because one would have to perpetuate that hack for that block for all time....  and the cost of that is prohibitive.  The author also makes an illogical leap regarding (impossible) attempts to falsify ID's on a blockchain (a use case he puts forward) and ties it to the black market.  It's clear the author is just trying to scare the reader with boogeyman arguments.   Finally, of course the author uses an example of poor security at an exchange, and tries to pin that on the blockchain.  That's like saying because my laptop was hacked that means the technology of the internet is flawed.  Raj Patel, you need more education on blockchain tech.

Miners have demonstrated that they are (largely) rational actors and will follow the money.  If the users prefer BTC over 2X, the value of BTC will remain higher than 2X, and the miners will follow the money.
Considering that miners are savaging BCH even as we speak, I wouldn't hold up EDA as a good thing....  perhaps a necessary concession for the survival of BCH, but BTC isn't a baby-faced new coin that is trying to lure users in order to survive.  It's the grandaddy of them all.

Sadly, I am neither experienced in marketing nor real estate, and I'm in crypto for less than a year.  So my opinion is just a laypersons.
However, some well placed ads in trade magazines I suspect would be worth the investment; other realtors may well come to you looking for someone with experience.  You just have to "let it be known" that you have done this before....
devil's in the details, but goodness, you have the hardest part already in the rear-view mirror... you have done it successfully already!
For starters, I know I'd be calling every real estate agent (or at least their agency) in your market letting them know that you have this experience and are willing to help with their cypto sale/purchase.  They will call you back sooner or later...  but your experience is unique enough that I could see it being called upon even outside your hometown/state.

Bitcoin isn't (won't be) deflationary.  It is (will be) exactly static.  The only deflation comes from individuals losing their keys/mind.
This sub gives ETH a lot of grief, but I do like their diminishing returns model of coin creation....  whereas BTC will eventually go to zero, ETH never will.... just the rate of coin creation will slow.
Regardless of which model, eventually the rate of coins being lost will outpace the rate of coins being created, and result in a very slight deflation.  But I think that rate is so small as to be negligible.

It would seem noone has been able to provide any definitive answer.... that's why the question keeps popping up.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:39:15
I freely admit I don't know what drives price in the short term, so I can't say if it's a coincidence or not.  I believe BTC will be more valuable in the long term, so I take my position accordingly.  I do think the change from December's highs is healthy, expected and a good dose of reality.
I think the metric most applicable would be merchant sales in BTC, expressed in a fiat denomination.  That would both eliminate exchange traffic, and account for price fluctuation.  I leave finding such information as an exercise for the reader.
And I can still bid lower than the average fee (by using tools like that mempool tracker) for the speed that I want to pay for.  Sure, the average might be X$ for the average next block confirmation, but if I see 20 cents are still getting in on the next block, I can bid that and still be confident I would be included.  Though I haven't made a single purchase where it was important to me to be in the next block anyhow....  which brings me to:
I think you might have the wrong idea about ordering food.  Merchants don't make you wait for confirmations... they accept the minimal risk of double spend in exchange for expediency.  I've ordered food from 3 different places in my area, and not a single one made me wait for a confirmation... How could they?  Confirmation time isn't guaranteed, even if you maxed out the tx cost.  I have ordered a few items online, and they both had a system where payment had to be confirmed in 24 hours.  I think that's a fair compromise.

 at six cents per transaction, the transaction would have to be pretty small for that to be relevant.
My baseline is the $5 purchase.  That's what a lot of credit cards set as their minimum purchase.  As long as BTC is less expensive than credit cards for a $5 purchase (and up), it's winning.  Right now a merchant gets charged about 25 cents for a $5 purchase.
25 cents a transaction... is the price to beat... that means about 13 satoshi's/byte is competitive with Visa.  Right now BTC is clearing 2  sat/byte tx's overnight, and 13 sat/byte tx's usually clear in the next block, so we are definitely winning.
And for purchases over $5, the scales tip even more dramatically in BTC's favor.
For truly micro purchases, those will likely be best served off the main chain anyhow, and will likely be small, recurring purchases....perfect for LN.
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:28:06
Short answer is yes.
A block has limited space.  Segwit tx's get the same data across, but take up less space.
Sortof like a bus full of skinny people can take more passengers per trip than a bus full of large people.
More people on the bus (more tx's per block) means the mempool stays empty, and everyone can pay lower fees on average.

Problem is, the growth of bitcoin, if it really takes off, will be way, way more than block size increases could ever handle.
One would need multi-Gigabyte sized blocks to handle Visa-level transactions, for example.  This kills the decentralization.  Not to mention microtransactions or IOT applications.
So, while a blocksize increase is a "quick fix", it just pushes the problem down the road, at the cost of increased centralization.  
If segwit reaches 90%+ use, BCH finally stabilizes and doesn't throw fluctuations into the hashpower, and miners aren't mining zero size blocks for (whatever) reasons, AND we STILL aren't getting the pool emptied regularly, then a blocksize increase might be warranted.  But that's not needed right now.
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:20:13


No, "they" don't.  I can disprove you easily by simply looking in my wallet.  Yep, I have some, therefore they don't own it all.

Maybe 37 cents breaks your bank.  Clearly not for the OP.  To each their own.  No judgement.
Here's a useful site to answer your confirmation time question: 
Looks like the majority of the time it was the next block (10 mins) with a few times of high demand.  Do we know the vendor needed a confirmation on a $7 order?
He also could have paid &lt;5 sat/b and the vendor still would have been paid the same day.   Maybe you can afford 6 cents?

read my original set of points; there is plenty a user can do.  And users know (or should know) ahead of time whether or not a given trade is favorable to them.  
I guess I'm just rich, but sending any amount anywhere in a permissionless environment is a bargain at a dollar or two even if it isn't a fraction of a cent.  Of course, less is better, but I am amazed at this technology in its current state and happy to be a part of it.

Thank you for the explanation... you helped me learn something new!
It's hard for me to wrap my brain around the weight concept.  So, if I understand correctly, the most weight-efficient tx would be a tx with one input being completely spent to one output, right?  Minimum amount of information at the 4 weight unit rate, and highest ratio of witness data.  Or am I backwards?
The conclusion I draw is that wallets will/should suggest fees in terms of sat/weight for a given transaction, since that is what the miner will be selecting on...

Correct, you will not suddenly get twice the coins on that day.  It is not like BCash.
What is happening is miners are currently rewarded for their work with new coins, that never existed before.  On halving day, those miners will get half as many coins as before.  This is so we slowly approach that 21 million cap, rather than it being an abrupt change.  4 years later, BTC rewards will halve again, ever more slowly approaching that limit.  By the year 2140, there will be so many halvings that eliminating the mining reward will be a non-event.

My high horse is awesome.  It rather enjoys trampling over the willfully ignorant.  Are you feeling stepped on?  LOL.
There are alternatives; you could use a cyptocurrency that isn't as popular, and has a fraction of the users.  Those networks are largely empty.  Because they are unused, the fees are lower.  But there is a catch...  little to no use cases.  Because no one uses them, they _can't be used_  It's self circular.
LTC, for example is stable and has regular low cost transactions.  But even fewer merchants accept that than BTC.
BCH is another example of a coin with a fraction of BTC# of users that promises low fees.  But, if you can even stand it's instability (going on 3 hours right now without a block-lol!) it has even fewer merchants than LTC.
IOTA promises no fees in perpetuity!  A bold claim.  But one can't even get IOTA on normal exchanges, much less use it at a merchant.
Fact is, BTC is the largest crypto out there, has the most merchants, and the most awareness in the community.  But the technology is still developing.  It's better than existing solutions (CC, Wire, checks and cash) in some use cases, but not as good in others.  It's another tool in the consumers pocket, and the consumer knows exactly what they are paying for.  As the technology improves, it will increasingly become mainstream, and tx fee improvements will develop.
Which is what this thread is all about.  
I'm done educating you.  Use BTC or don't.  It's just another tool at your fingertips.  Don't blame the tool if you mash your own fingers because you didn't read the manual.

It's more because of the way it was done; it's a closed room agreement by some to force the change on the larger community.  S2X is seen more as a takeover attempt than an effort to implement a change.

Here's what's going to happen:
Mining will become the driver for card technology.  Gaming used to fill this role.  Right now the crossover is happening.
Eventually, the miners (who are profit driven) will get all the latest and greatest.  Gamers will likely move down a notch, possibly even taking out of date mining cards used....
At the end of the day, gaming is for fun, and the gamers can wait a bit.  But since mining is for profit, they must stay on the bleeding edge to compete/stay in business.

I'm not even rich, but I know that having assests is a better life than having debts.
I like bitcoin.... it's moving in the direction I want it to, and a big part of that is it's deflationary nature.  If you don't like it, why are you even here?  Surely there is some inflationary coin out there, or you can just have the regular fiat.  We can coexist.
Of course, if a deflationary currency exists side by side with an inflationary one..... one will push out the other.  Before long, people who think like you will be working for people who think like me.  Or, if not working, depending on my charity.

Let's also play this out... I'm going to use US purchases as an example, please forgive me....
Let's say you take your lady friend out to dinner.  Say, a $50 meal.
In the US, the merchant pays (.10 +3%) $1.60.
BTC can easily beat that price point today for tx's... even if one wanted a "rush/next block" rate.
In BTC's case, it is the purchaser paying the fee, but I think the writing is on the wall for cc's... more and more merchants will be offering cash/crypto discounts.

@_date: 2017-10-31 14:41:01
&lt;shrug&gt; to each their own.  I think it will.  I'm in a pretty good position as long as inflation doesn't eat away at my hard work I've accumulated over the years.

Perhaps someone else can elaborate about the LN; I am not knowledgeable about that enough to explain.  I do know that one can have unlimited amount of transactions with another party until either party closes the channel, at which time the total of the transactions post on the main chain.

@_date: 2017-10-31 13:13:03
While this is true, it won't be easy.  It is likely that the current chain will slow down, at least temporarily.  That might spook some people who don't expect it.
It is not clear sailing ahead, but the community can exert its will by hodling and refusing to conduct business on the new chain.
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:30:50
Yes.  In general there was some concern ahead of time because not everyone understood the ramifications.  Afterwards price per BTC increased.  But BTC has already been through two, and the mechanism is well understood and predictable.  Therefore, the price will be "baked in" ahead of time.  At each halving, the rate of BTC inflation is lowered.  I personally believe the next halving will decrease the rate of inflation to lower than the rate that coins are lost due to error/death, and we'll have a truly deflationary currency  (if we dont' already).

Yes, it is important to have your bitcoin stored on a wallet that will at the very least not force you onto one chain or another.  You need to know how your wallet will react to this fork, because it is so contentious/politicized.   There is risk here for people who are not paying close attention.

Oh, sweet summer child.
For one, the definition of wrong/illegal changes over time.  What was once socially acceptable becomes unacceptable or even illegal over time.
Our parents/grandparents undoubtedly frequented segregated businesses.  At the time, almost everyone did.  Slowly, white people realized that this form of discrimination is wrong.  I would hate for my grandmother to be hunted down by someone and taunted for being racist (which she was, by today's standards) for the actions of her youth.  Also, change isn't always slow.  Revolutions, in particular, change what is acceptable/illegal very, very quickly.  Enter in obligatory Nazi reference (and Jewish business) here&gt;.

The cost alone is a HUGE factor in remittances, for example.  The immigrant worker sending funds home to his family for example, probably really appreciates a way to send globally for a few cents, rather than the enormous cuts the remittance and currency exchange markets are gouging their customers for.
Wikileaks valued the permissionless qualities of BTC.  It is/was crucial to their survival when the US Govt pressured banks/paypal and credit card companies to cease operations with Wikileaks because the govt didn't like what Wikileaks was saying.
Different people value different qualities.  The point is, with BTC, they have an option that now includes all these qualities.  That is pretty unique.

In my business, 10 minutes/an hour is perfectly reasonable.  &lt;shrug&gt; to each their own.
Chargebacks are only a "feature" for a consumer, not for a merchant.  I do believe it is faulty, it allows a person to welch on their payment.  I ship product and they walk away with it without any compensation to me.  That's a problem.  But not for me.... because, again, I price knowing that there are a few cheats out there...we all pay for that "feature"....
you bet I'd offer a discount for people paying in a form that doesn't charge me on the front end and allow cheats to skip their bills on the back end months later....
Not to mention the whole decentralization argument....

Great website.  BTC is over 40% more profitable now btw (for those that didn't follow the link), so I expect that's a profit margin too big to ignore for long...  10% might not be worth the effort? of switching...
Question...  I was wondering how the estimated days to difficulty retarget is calculated...
I also noted that BTC's retarget date jumped up significantly during the BCH retarget...  I don't understand why....
And weirdly, although the chains normally alternate retargets, this time BCH is expected to retarget again before BTC....

That is a great description of the gambler's fallacy, but that's not quite the same as what's going on in our bitcoin example.
A block is found every (10) minutes.  Let's say all the transaction fall randomly within that 10 minute window.  Some get in just in the nick of time, and are in a confirmation block within seconds.  Some transactions just missed the last block, and must wait the full 10 minutes for the next block...
but, for everyone that takes 1 second, there is another that must wait 10 minutes... and on average it's 5 minutes.
I think.  But thanks for the calm reply....  upvotes from me regardless!

There are two bills relating to cryptocurrency, one in the senate (which is drastically unfavorable) and one in the house (which attempts to exclude the first $600 in spending from capital gains).

If, in 2015, the hashrate was a tiny fraction of what it is now, that means the drop would have to be that much MORE precipitous and that much MORE effort would have to be undertaken by a nation-state.

@_date: 2017-10-26 17:22:22
Take it up with that poster; he's the one that brought up cc's. I was correcting a factual error, one that you insist on repeating.
You are wrong that cc's are cheaper.  CC's charge merchants significant fees, and those are passed on to the consumer in higher prices.   Look no further than the difference between cash and cc prices at gas stations in some markets, or why some business refuse to accept cc's because they are so expensive.
My company makes software priced in the multiple thousands per license.  CC transaction fees are notoriously difficult to parse, but a fixed fee of 35 cents plus 3% isn't unusual for most transactions.  Tell me again how me, as a merchant, paying $150.35  for a single sale of my $5000 software is less expensive?  Lol.  Plus there is the threat of chargebacks.  Just because the consumer doesn't see the bill, doesn't mean they aren't paying for it.
There is a real reason businesses don't accept all credit cards, or in some cases, any credit cards.... 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:34:29
No, I don't think you should be allowed to use a product/service and unilaterally decide to not pay months after the fact.
Everyone pays for that sort of dishonesty.  And let's be real here, I guarantee you _are_ paying for that dishonesty.
Funny, I paid with BTC for my lunch just yesterday, and the merchant didn't feel any need to wait.  Maybe because he knows it's not worth anyone's time to try to doublespend BTC for the amount of a reuben.  LOL.
Besides, since you seem to be so challenged at reading, I'd like to remind you that this thread is about the _future_, everyone knows BTC isn't ready to handle VISA level volume yet.
Your argument boils down, again to the mailman saying the internet isn't an effective communication tool.

@_date: 2018-07-26 15:35:43
Because I paid a fraction of what BTC is worth now.
Because it demonstrates to naysayers that BTC is viable as a currency.
Because it is pseudoanonymous
Because I like supporting BTC merchants and want to do my share to help the market grow.
Because people in line see me paying with BTC and ask me about it.
Because I can pay and forget about it (and not get a bill later like with credit cards)

Banning bitcoin is like banning math.
Yeah, a government can really put a damper on in it in local use, but can't stop people from owning it.  And really, it will only hurt that government in the long run, as their citizens will be missing out on this explosive growth.
I'm sorry for the short-sightedness of your leaders, but you can still own yourself (though likely only spend outside of your borders)
But to answer your question, once you _have_ crypto, I'd feel pretty safe against them knowing you have it.
I mean, you can just write down on a scrap of paper your key.... or even memorize.  It would be impossible to prevent ownership.  Might be possible to hinder transaction..... but even then, not stop it effectively.
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:53:44

I won't get into the politics of conservative/liberal ideals...  but I can tell you this... Nowadays "red states" are traditionally conservative/republican areas (US interior states) and "blue states" are traditionally liberal/democrat areas (coastal states).
However, the red/blue nomenclature is a recent development.  Prior to the Presidential election of 2000, news organizations had a standard...  the incumbent party holding office was designated as blue for the purpose of graphics, and the challenging party was red.  So democrats and republicans flip-flopped colors depending on whether they were the challengers or the incumbents that year.  In the 2000 election, which was so very close and contested long after election day, maps showing the electoral college results were repeatedly shown to the public, for weeks.  In that election, Republicans were the challenging party, and shown in red.  However, the effect of seeing all those maps for so long falsely correlated red with conservative, and blue with liberal in the public's mind.  Nowadays, news organzations have abandoned the red=challenger model and just use red=Republican and blue=Democrat method universally.
In my opinion, there is something lost in doing that.  It's important to understand that politics is a balance, and when any one party becomes too dominant, it's important to see the value of challengers with fresh ideas.

Try not to think of it in terms of only the rich have X.  Think of it as "only the people who can afford to pay their way have X".  If a person can't afford to pay off their loans, they never should have taken them in the first place.  Giving loans only makes people wage-slaves.
I want saving and budgeting to be rewarded.  Not frivolous spending.
Absolutely, positively, yes I do.
That housing bubble is a direct result of too many people getting loans they never should have been offered in the first place.  The fault is partially the banks for issuing them, sure.  But if the deadbeat borrowers had held up their end of the agreement, and never defaulted, then our society as a whole wouldn't have been compelled to bail them out after the fact (at extreme loss).
Poor people should never be given things they can't afford to pay back, unless you are running a charity.

1) Mining or exchange of goods, services or fiat are the only ways I know of to obtain bitcoin.  So, (other than mining) the same ways one gets fiat.  How would one get Euros?  Work for them, trade for them, exchange other currency for them.  Same thing.
2) Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous.  Yes, anyone could look where a particular coin came from, but it isn't tied to a name.  Furthermore, you can get a new address anytime.  Your autonomy is definitely being infringed on with a bank or cc.... that's what the terms of service that most people skip over detail.  With a flip of a switch by those with the will/power, one can find themselves unable to conduct financial transactions.  See also Cyprus 2013, or any other bank run.
3) I disagree.  I prefer the currency that increases in value over time.  Volatility does not bother me.  (I also think volatility will decrease as adoption increases)
4) You said the "existing apps work for everyone".  They don't work for the unbanked...  a group of 2 billion people.  It is your burden of proof to prove that BTC won't help any of them, not the other way around.  
5) It's not my job to convince you, or anyone else.  But you are coming off as combative, so I'm pointing out that BTC isn't a threat to you.  If you want to learn, I'll teach you, but I am not trying to convince you to use BTC.  People can come to BTC in their own time.  I think this is a great opportunity for people to "beat the masses".
BTC has qualities that I haven't found anywhere else. (especially together).  I'm a big fan of the technology.

No, my education was paid for by my labor entirely.  I used the skills I had at my disposal (health, minimum education, willingness to take risk) and I found a job/career that offered a benefit I wanted to trade them for (minimal pay, stable housing, healthcare and paid education).  It was an investment in myself even more impressive than Bitcoin, dare I say.
The fact that my employer was military is beside the point.  It wasn't charity, it wasn't a loan.  I fvckin' _earned_ every goddamn one of those GI Bill dollars.  That was the contract I signed.  I delivered my labor (which did involve digging ditches), my employer held up their end of the deal.  Win/Win for everyone involved.

"someone who has my bank".... banks are regional, BTC is borderless.  Also, getting a bank account requires identity. No identity is required to receive/spend BTC
B -- only if the bank approves, BTC is permissionless
C--banks denominate in fiat (an inflationary medium), BTC is not inflationary.
It is easy to send payments faster/cheaper than BTC.  It is harder to do so while preserving the principals of borderless, permissionless, censorship resistant, decentralized, etc.  BTC puts those latter qualities first, and does a "good enough" job on the fast and cheap aspects.

Users make the decision, users have all the information available to them, users set the rate and the timing, users control the tools they use.  So yes, personal culpability.
I mean, yes, there are some use cases where cash might be better.  Clearly BTC isn't ready to replace all use cases today.  As it stands, only a fraction of merchants even accept it!
Besides, are you poor?  can you not afford 233kb*10 sat/kb* 1BTC/10000000sat * $5700/BTC = $1.32 for the ability to send any amount over any distance without any centralized third party?  That's a frickin awesome ability well worth the expense, IMHO.  
Compare that to cc fees of say 0.35 + 3% in the US....  or even worse the fees from wire transfer services....  It sounds like mostly you are just complaining because the fees are visible and the responsibility of the consumer, rather than the merchant.

1)  They don't have to convert their whole lives all at once (though some have, including people on this forum)(not me).  They can just obtain some BTC and spend at the merchants that do.  They might do this because of any number of benefits that BTC offers.
2) Cash is definitely more anonymous than BTC.  Banking, however, is not.  There is a difference.  CC's especially are not.... they actively will market to you based on your spending habits, and cc records are routinely pulled in investigations.  Most of the people don't need to worry about that.... until they do.  I can provide numerous examples of people being cut off from participating in commerce for a wide variety of reasons... but they all involve someone in a position of power deciding that they shouldn't be able to spend/receive money.      Yes, absolutely any non-inflationary asset would be useful in an inflationary economy.  I notice you keep changing the comparisions....alternatively pitting BTC against cash, credit cards, debit cards, alternative fiats, and gold and silver.  Each type is going to have certain advantages and disadvantages compared to BTC.  The great thing is people can choose what is best for them at any one point.  It's not one size fits all.  There are lots of ways to measure assets:  familiarity, acceptance, volatility, deflationary, store of value, transaction speed, divisibility, privacy, censorship resistance, unit of account, nationality, and much, much more.  Often times in order to strengthen one quality one must weaken others.  I strongly believe that BTC has the potential to be the best "balance" of all those competing qualities.  I also believe that the longer BTC survives, some of those qualities will improve over time.
3.  Noone can predict the future, of course.  But looking at the past does provide information nonetheless.  I can say with more certainty that the dollar/any fiat will buy less goods in the future than I can say anything about BTC good or bad.  I do know that the creation of BTC is a known, mathematical constant.  The dollar (or other fiat) can be printed whenever those in power want to.
4) People in industrialized countries with cellphones will be among the last to embrace Bitcoin.  They already have many functional alternatives, and people resist change inherently.  It takes a truly forward thinking person to escape their comfort zone.  However, those same forward thinkers can often position themselves in ways that benefit them.
5) Fair enough.  Lots of BCH folks come to this forum and play the role of concern troll.  I might have been jumping the gun, so I apologize for that, too.

I largely agree.
But there will come a point, as each early adopter wishes to convert their paper gains to real-world benefits that they will sell.  It is inevitable that the price will stabilize at some point, it can't keep growing exponentially forever.....
Once that point is reached (or at which the price increase is minimal) than more and more will lessen their grip on their coins.  There will be limited benefit to holding them anymore.

Visa is centralized, requires permission, expensive and has limitations on who in the world can use it.
BTC is decentralized, permissionless, inexpensive and global.  Furthermore, I believe LN will increase the transaction capacity and 1st layer solutions will only be for very large transfers (things that require title, like car/boat/land or similarly sized purchases)

Mining companies won't start generating their own power... power companies will start their own mining services.... 
They will setup a mining farm near a power plant that has excess capacity, and as local demand grows, they will wind down mining and move to the next location.
Power production is local and fixed; mining is scaleable and portable.

Wrong again, buckaroo.
Bitcoin transactions confirm in 10 minutes on the fast end, maybe a few hours on the slow end.  Depends again on the fees the _user_ decides to pay.  Credit cards (which can be charged back) take months to finally settle.  Besides, 2nd layer solutions will give consumers even more options for speed and transaction price.
Regardless if they pay them directly or not, you better believe consumers are paying them.  What, you think the merchants just eat it?  LOL.

That's a good point, but with so many altcoins taking dramatic dips, it seems clear that many people were selling alts to buy BTC.
Unless I have it backwards... maybe so many people had been investing in altcoins because of the 2X uncertainty, and now that there have been multiple "good news" for BTC, they are moving back to what they would have invested in otherwise.
Gosh, that would be awesome.
In any case, I do hope a split goes though, especially with replay protection.  It will serve as a warning to others about what happens with contentious forks.  And if I can get a small bump to my holdings, great.  Two forks in a row (BCH, B2X) with identical results (forks relegated to the fringe corners of the market) would strengthen BTC even more...
I consider myself more educated than the layperson on investing, but this cryptospace has absolutely turned me on my head.  Finance used to be the world of cobwebs and dust, and this is exciting....  coins battling to the death, new ideas and new technology....  It's a feeling I haven't experienced in a long, long time.

Free coins.... which may or may not have value....  Personally, I convert them automatically to BTC as soon as possible because I am knowledgeable about BTC.

Nothing; but because the supply of newly minted coins will lessen, so it will likely have a positive effect on price, and a modestly negative effect on transaction fees.  Likely the price effect will be accounted for ahead of time, so it's not going to jump dramatically on that day or anything.  Bitcoin has had halvings before; here's the countdown to the next one:

It can be both, especially before the masses arrive.  The later one arrives to the bitcoin party, the more it is just a currency. (Though you'll have more merchants to use it at).  But... if you beat the masses and have the foresight....  then it's an appreciating asset.

It's a recent development.  It's being fought in the courts on a state-by-state level.  I started another thread on it with a link to the details.
Merchants can give cash (or other payment) discount for a long time.  The rule now is that all credit cards must be treated the same....if a surcharge is for one, there must be a surcharge for all.
But absolutely for sure they had a sign up notifying customers about the recent law change and the fact they would be adding a charge.  The only thing stopping this from being widespread right now is merchant competition...  10 states have individual rules banning it, but those are all being challenged...

It's understandable that it is difficult for you to see the value if you are used to Dollars, which is arguably the world's strongest currency.  But the vast majority of the planet uses a less strong currency.  
Bitcoin (or, more largely, cryptocurrency in general) brings all of the following attributes:
Censorship Resistant
(and several others)
Those qualities make BTC a better investment, and a better currency than many of the world's existing fiat alternatives.  Yes, adoption isn't at every merchant, but it is unrealistic to expect it would spring into mass adoption instantaneously.  It is, however becoming more understood and respected as time goes on as a result of those aforementioned qualities.
Bitcoin will start be eating the edges first... weak currencies like the Bolivar, or the remittances market....  and as those use cases become proven, it will gain strength and become adopted in maybe  middle of the road currencies and a merchant preferred currency.
Supporters here think those trends are likely to continue, and they seek to profit by holding quantities now (and continuing to educate people about the benefits).
By the way, all the costs you mentioned are already paid by the users of BTC (maybe a few cents for a transaction)  Those costs are very much intentional, and work to secure the network against fraud.
BTC is not yet ready to handle the worlds currency needs, but it is growing, and for some people, they see an opportunity to get in ahead of the masses.

I forget how coinbase charges, but likely it would be a diminishing return on the expense (or no-lube intrusion, as it were)
ie, if you were transferring 1/4 million $'s, the expense might only be $10.... which is a trivial amount.  
You got caught on a transaction with a very small amount.
Sortof like why merchants don't accept credit card transactions under $5.... they get charged a flat fee (a minimum of 35 cents) that might be the difference between a profitable transaction and one that costs them...
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:35:36
As you can see from the variety of comments, different people have different opinions.
The ledger was backordered when I ordered mine, so it is unlikely you will be able to get a hardware wallet before the fork.  (which is my recommended course of action)
I recommend anyone with more than $500 worth of crypto to use a hardware wallet.
However, since that option is likely no longer at your fingertips, the best you can do is order a hardware wallet now, and ride out the fork on the exchange.  Coinbase promises to split the coins for you...  maybe they will, and maybe you'll have access to both coins in a short amount of time.
Or maybe they will release one coin or the other when it is convenient to _them_.
By leaving your coins there, that is the power you have given up in exchange for convenience.
Another alternative is a software wallet, like Electrum.  That would let you have control of your coins ahead of the fork.  Of course, that also implies you'd have the responsibility of splitting them yourself.  And this split is not like the BitcoinCash split; it does not have replay protection which means to the user that to properly split them will be more complicated.  Not impossible, just more difficult.
Order a hardware wallet now (I use the Ledger), realize it won't arrive in time (likely), and decide if the convenience Coinbase offers is worth the lack of control for this fork.  That is a personal decision.

his response:
Dear XXX:
Thank you for contacting me regarding H.R. 3708, the CryptoCurrency Tax Fairness Act. I appreciate you sharing your thoughts on this important issue. 
As you know, H.R. 3708 would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to create a de minimus exemption for cryptocurrency transactions under $600. The bill ultimately seeks to subject digital currency to a similar tax regime to that of foreign currency. 
Upon introduction, H.R. 3708  was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means, on which I serve. Rest assured, I understand and appreciate your concern. As the Committee considers this legislation, I will be sure to keep your thoughts in mind and share them with my legislative colleagues. Pursuant to your request, I will also review your request to review the work of the "Blockchain Caucus". 
Again, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on this issue. Please feel free to contact me in the future should you have any additional questions or concerns. In the meantime, my continuing best regards to you and your family.

@_date: 2018-07-24 15:17:45
No, I don't.
The rallying cry is to not "cash out", not avoid spending it.  Those are not the same. I would argue many encourage people to spend (on purchases).
It makes sense to HODL if you think adoption is going to be more widespread.
The community can both work to encourage adoption, as well as hold some because they think the value will rise.
Spend and replace is a popular mantra that encapsulates both those concepts....   help grow the marketplace, and grow assets as the BTC/fiat price rises.
Spend and replace is what I do.  It's foolish for me to spend all my BTC savings, if I am confident that BTC will grow.  But I also want to do my share and reward merchants that accept BTC with my business, so I go out of my way to spend BTC at those merchants.

I haven't used software wallets in a spell, but Electrum is releasing a segwit compatible imminently that will have the ability to set your own rate.

Small items, like the mythical coffee purchase?  Hand over the item right away.  Customer satisfaction is far more important than the small risk of fraud.

You are incorrect to say that Visa/Mastercard confirm instantly.  Don't feel bad, it's a common misconception.  CC's post instantly, just like BTC.  CC's actually confirm days or even weeks later.

You might find this reddit post enlightening:
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:38:30
This is factually inaccurate.
BTC is faster (confirmation in 10 minutes for high value transactions, a few hours for low value) compared to credit cards with take months to settle for the merchant and a day or two for the consumer (and can be charged back at the customer's whim)
BTC is also cheaper (currently less than 10 satoshi's/byte, and even at high volume time less than 150 sat/byte) compared to fixed percentages that cc's charge... 
CC's do have more availability currently, but compared already more merchants accept BTC than accepted plastic 8 years after that concept was promoted.  The first credit card was invented in 1950.  How many establishments accepted credit cards in 1958?  So, while credit cards do have an edge in that category right now.... this thread is a projection about the future, and BTC's future looks bright.

So, now that that issue has been solved, I expect your enthusiasm will return.
And to be fair, one never had to pay those fees.  Many simply paid a lower fee and were ok with waiting until the price went down.  Not every tx needs to be confirmed right away...  
And if you learn to use that website, you can set a fee from a position of knowledge about the environment, and decide for yourself what you want to do.

Or, timing...  that's another variable you control.
Ultimately, you, the user are in control, and you know what the transaction fee is going to be before you make your decision.
You made your decision, don't complain because you regret it or were too lazy to understand it and just guessed what would happen.

Banks see crypto as a liquid asset, and they have traditionally been reluctant to allow purchases of liquid assets on credit as it quickly gets people into trouble.   For instances, in many places one can't purchase lottery tickets with credit cards, and the fees for cash advances on credit cards are a whole different set than traditional merchandise purchases.
The fact that banks can dictate what you are spending your money on underscores the need for permissionless crypto like BTC.

233 bytes (typical tx) * 2 sat/byte * 1btc/10000000sat * $8900/btc = 4 cents.
I don't know where you live, but 4 cents is not a high fee, especially considering its decentralized, global, permissionless, psuedoanonymous and near-instant.

How much does IHOP spend every transaction for credit card purchases? (Typically both a flat fee PLUS a percentage)...
No, not worse in almost every single way, not by a longshot.

tx fee is entirely independent of amount sent.
That is a straight up fact, and the fact that you claimed that makes me question your statement...
@_date: 2018-04-23 19:15:18
Absolutely.  Without decentralized nodes, we might as well just have a single ledger.
Bitcoin isn't as fast as a bank ledger, and that's ok.  What we lose in that we gain in decentralization (read: censorship resistance and financial autonomy)
Once you truly understand the importance of that autonomy, then you'll see why protecting as many nodes as possible is important.
@_date: 2018-04-23 19:19:22
It is, I agree.  But once you get it, it's wildly informative.  I encourage you to put in the effort to digest it.
The point is, though, that btc fees of 2-3 sat/byte have been enough to ensure the next block for nearly 3 months now.  
The causes for this are many, and I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader.
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:52:34
This has been asked many times, and there's not a fixed answer.  But the amount lost is likely in the millions.

@_date: 2018-04-12 19:59:06
Wrong on many levels.
A transaction does not take 10 minutes, it is posted globally in a few seconds.  It _confirms_ in 10 minutes (assuming next block).  I have never once had a merchant make me wait for a confirmation.  Similarly, when I use a credit card, the merchant doesn't make me wait for that transaction to confirm.  Posting != confirmation.
Current payment systems are centralized, and can be orders of magnitude slower if moving through multiple entities/banks/countries.  For instance, I can send funds to my friend overseas by only knowing his address.  Through centralized banking or remittance services, that would go through layers of banks and services, each taking a sizeable fee. 
Also, permissionless, decentralized and psuedo-anonymous are all qualities that have value to me that I can't find outside of crypto.
Finally, don't forget that the current fiat system is prone to inflation at the hands of central banks.  With crypto, math governs the rate of inflation (if any) and is known to all.
Scaling solutions have been discussed ad nauseum and BTC's certainly is handling all the volume it needs to now, and the future looks bright for future growth. (Segwit, LN, and more)  Furthermore, crypto isn't only Bitcoin, other coins emphasize some aspects more than others (Privacy, scaling, speed, etc)  Bitcoin still seems to have the world's attention as the best blend atm.

Then that isn't anywhere close to a year. 
Tip top of peak was $18,500 around the second week of December.
Bottom of the dip was $6800 a scant two weeks ago.  (closer to 7k than 6k)
That's 4 months.  That's hardly confusable for a year.  That's not a problem with "rough numbers". 
I'm sorry about your luck, but the number of people who have held for a year and not come out ahead is pretty much limited to the tiny subset of people who purchased during the 2014 downturn, and even they eventually came out ahead on a longer timescale.
And I don't respect people who can't hold on timescales shorter than a year... 
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:27:47
no, that doesn't make sense, either...
If you sold at $6500 (April '18), and had been holding for a year, that means you bought in April of 17 or so, when the price was around $1100.  You are doing just fine, I don't know what the complaint is here... you got six times your investment!!

Not familiar w/ that site/service.
I am familiar w/ the BTC, however, and can do math:
100 sat/byte tx's are getting in the next block.  So for a simple, URGENT tx, one would expect:
226 bytes * 100 sat/byte * 1 BTC/100000000 sat * $9000/ BTC = $2.03 in fees.
That $2 for an URGENT, simple tx.  And, I'd like to point out that the mempool is atypically full right now.  Quite likely that overnight it will clear and be back down to under 10 cents for an URGENT tx.
If I had to guess, I'd say your site/service is overcharging you.

If Moon is the destination of rollercoaster guy....
Tallest roller coaster 1.4 X 10^2 m tall
Moon 3.8 X 10^8 meters away. 
So, to go from roller coaster to the moon is a magnitude of 10^6 difference.
The sun is 1.5 X 10 ^11 meeters...  sure that's only a magnitude of 10^5, but I'll allow it.  Conveniently, the earth sun distance is 1 AU (Astronomical Unit), so we just need to find a body at 100,000 AU for our next leap....
let's say the far reaches of the Ooort cloud....  some tiny pebble in space, 100,000 AU from the sun.  That's also about 1.5 light-years, by the way. But pebbles aren't very interesting...  Since we hedged our bets downward earlier, I'm ok with hedging our bets upward for Alpha Centauri at 4.5 lightyears.
So, now we need an object about 150,000 light years away.  Coincidentally, that's about the diameter of the Milky way!  How convenient.  
So, to sum up, with roughly proportional leaps:
Roller coaster
Alpha Centauri
Opposite side of Milky way.

Since we all know that the speed of light has not been exceeded by anything known to man, this implies that travelling from Alpha Centauri to the opposite side of the milky way is impossible in 4 years. (Even getting to Alpha C. in time will be right at the limit).
Therefore, the price of BTC must reach its maximum around 2028.  That's when I'll begin spending.

I did.  And I don't mind a bit.  I don't worry about short term trends that are shorter than a pimple's life.

And the anonymity of cash is that much more weakened....
Governments have long hated cash, this would have happened with or without BTC/crypto....
but now people have an alternative!

You quack like a duck
@_date: 2018-04-23 19:01:53
oy.  Last time fees were more than a few cents was before the LN rollout and Segwit adoption.... months ago.
There have been several improvements over the past few months.

NYSE takes every holiday/weekend and there have been multiple emergency stops, as well, some for days.

Might also be worth your while to find local Bitcoin meetup groups... I bet someone would be willing to buy straight up.
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:06:45
Some people have very short attention spans.  
I, for one, share your longer term vision.
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:26:48
but, over the past few months, a sat/byte or two has been enough to get a confirmation if not instantly, within 24 hours.

They better fight harder, faster if they hope to have an effect...
I think by the next halvening it will be too late....

I care about the potential for a decentralized, permissionless, pseudonmymous and trans-national currency.
I am also a person.
Your statement is demonstrably incorrect.

I'm sorry you were suckered into BCash, it is people like you that are paying the price for the intentional misleading efforts that BCash promotes.

Y people investing Z$ does not meant the market cap will be  Y*Z greater.
Market cap is spot price times outstanding shares.  Not everyone has purchased at the spot price.  In fact, especially in crypto, many, many coins were mined or purchased for far less.  
Here's an easy way to demonstrate.  Y people decide to buy, but the rest of the community decide to sell, and the miners have to unload their production as well.  Since Y is less than the rest of the community and miners, the overall spot price goes down (affecting market cap) even though Y new people have joined the market.

Not until retirement, by which time I expect to be able to spend it, not convert it.
@_date: 2019-05-02 10:46:46
Agreed.  But that's the long run.  Right now miners are predominantly making $$ of the base reward right now.  
And in the long run, small transactions won't even be on the main chain.  We are in an interim period while adoption spreads and infrastructure develops.
I don't think anyone is saying we don't have enough miners in business to protect the network, anyhow.

2 sat/B transactions are routinely getting processed.  How do you figure $2?  
Average tx size for a one input, two output tx is 250 B
2 sat/B X 250 B X 1 BTC/100000000 X $5350/BTC = 2.675 _cents_
Yes, 2 and a half cent transaction fees are low.  If you were in a rush, and had to have your tx post in next block, that's only 10 sat/B  (about 10 cents a transaction).
I'm curious where you got $2 in fees from.
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:00:12
I, for one, salute you.
Remember, nooone ever has lost on a holding strategy who has held longer than 3.5 years.....  
Obligatory PPINGOFR, but for crypto I think there are bonafide reasons while long term holding is the best strategy.  (Halving events, limited supply, early in crypto life-cycle).
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:07:36
Bitcoin doesn't have to be the best currency, it just has to be better than the worst.
Personally, I think that BTC will replace the worst currencies first, and expand to more and more countries.  The USD, being one of the strongest, will be among the last few holdouts.
@_date: 2019-05-03 10:45:28
I think that shows an average.
Which includes complex transactions and people massively overpaying because they don't know (or don't care) they could be paying less.  That number also cherry picks a high-point in that average line.
For a simple transaction like I mathed out, the fee required was a few cents, even if you wanted on the very next block.
I think it's disingenuous to suggest that the fee required $2/tx.  That's misinformation.  Maybe someday, but certainly not today.
Bill Gates and 100 High school dropouts walk into a room.  On average, everyone's a millionaire.

A small fraction of gold's value is intrinsic.
Fun fact: If one were to take all the above ground gold in the world and melt it into a cube, that cube would be about 21m on each side.
Second fun fact: Mansa Musa (richest man ever) once went on vacation, and he took nearly 100 camels each loaded 100-200 pounds of gold.  He also brought along 12,000 slaves each carrying a 4 pound gold bar.  His vacation (to Mecca) instantly destroyed the economy of every town he went through due to overnight hyperinflation. (He gave gold to the poor he encountered on the way)  On his return trip, he felt bad about destroying the economy, so he took loans in the local currency to buy back the gold to repair the damage.
Imagine taking a caravan of gold wherever you went and bankrupting kingdoms with every step....
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:11:23


Agreed.  But I also think you will agree that the USD is among the top ten strongest currencies in the world, easily arguable that it is _the_ strongest.
BTC doesn't have to beat the strongest, it just has to beat the _weakest_.  And, as the weakest currencies fail out more and more of the global economy will be done in BTC.
Also, I made a purchase (my lunch) on Thursday with BTC.  So it works as money for me, as well.
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:52:17
What you are saying is definitely an important distinction to make.
Also, at a certain point, the rate of new coin creation will drop below the rate at which coins are lost to death/misplaced keys.  
I suspect BTC will reach that point if not this halvening, then the next.
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:57:44
Moreso, I think.
For the first time in Bitcoin's history, the annual inflation rate will drop _below_ the USD inflation rate.
Currently, BTC is inflating at 3.78%.  At the halvening, that will drop to 1.8%... just under the traditional rate the US dollar has inflated at for the past 4 decades.  
At that point, BTC will be better than the dollar in terms of inflation.  That has never happened before.  I think it is spectacularly important.
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:15:33
pump and dump was supposed to be that jump from 4k to 5k....
of course, that never materialized...

And all have inflated.

My local sub shop accepts 0 confirmations today.
As the mgr puts it...  "if some jackass wanted to go through the trouble required, sure, they can have a free lunch.  Besides, I deal with credit card chargebacks every month"
@_date: 2019-05-25 15:20:57
Thank you for sharing; I agree....
We should be looking at BTC on the scale of decades, not something that will ever be turned back into fiat.

Thursday.  Well, technically it was a Pepsi and a sub.

true, true.  This is an important thing to note, especially for users of paper wallets....  from what I understand, when spending from a paper wallet ALL the funds must be moved at once.  That could be a huge coin destroyer for the unwary...
