Loans usually re-enter the banking system as another deposit.   
But believe what you will.
If you choose to believe money lent does not come from deposits or money borrowed from another bank using its deposits, if you choose to believe a bank with no money at all, deposited at correspondent banks or the Fed can wire money to pay for your house, I am afraid there is nothing I can do.

I appreciate your civility but you are confused.
100,000 in loans on 10,000 in deposits would be 1,000%.
The loan-to-deposit ratio (LTD) is a commonly used statistic for assessing a bank's liquidity by dividing the bank's total loans by its total deposits.

The money does not "come out of thin air".
It comes from deposits.
I deposit money, the bank lends a fraction to you.
Your home builder deposits that money and a fraction of that is lent out.
This increases the M1 and M2 money supply.
Money is "created" by the central bank.


When the Fed buys $10 million of Treasury bills on the open market, it credits the selling banks' reserve accounts for $10 million.Since the reserves didn't come from another bank, one could say they were created out of “thin air.”The initial expansion of deposits and reserves will lead to an expansion of 10 times $10 million because each dollar of reserves will support roughly 10 times that amount in deposits.

No, the 10% is your down payment to the builder and the bank finances the other 90%.  That financed portion comes from the non reserved portion of deposits.

Perhaps it would be easier if you thought of yourself as the bank.
Five people each give you 1000 but you have to give it back whenever they want.
You lend out 4500 and get IOUs.
Those people spend the money and the receivers "deposit" with you.
This repeats.
Eventually there is a lot more in IOUs than the original 5000. But there is still only 5000 in cash.

That is not how it works.
If one million is deposited then 900,000 can be loaned out.
If that 900,000 is then deposited then 810,000 can be loaned out.
If that 810,000 is deposited then an additional 729,000 can be loaned out.
If the first 900,000 is deposited at another bank the first Bank of deposit box the holder of the initial 1,000,000 cannot lend out any more money.

I believe you are thinking about the m1 and m2 money supply.
The same "cash" is counted repeatedly in the form of IOUs.
At a reserve rate if 10% the amount of IOUs will be 10 times the initial deposit of cash in my "you be the bank and let's use bills" example.
IOUs increase and balance but no new bills are created to get 10 times the amount owed by you the bank and ten times the amount owed to you the bank. Again, no new bills have to be printed in this dollar bills and IOU example.

They're not at all the same.
A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment method that pays off early investors with deposits from later ones.
Fractional reserve banking is the practice of keeping only a fraction of a bank's demand deposits on reserve, while lending out the rest. The reserve requirement is how central banks limit the amount of money that can float around in commercial banks.
In the latter case, there is no "later investor" somewhere down near the bottom of a money food chain. Every dollar, regardless of whether it was created fresh from one of the federal reserve banks or created via several chained loans, is worth the same. If the dollars depreciate for whatever reason, they do so for everyone.
Now, if you want a good example of a Ponzi scheme that is actually legal, look at Social Security.

Bank deposits consist of money placed into banking institutions for safekeeping. These deposits are made to deposit accounts such as savings accounts, checking accounts and money market accounts. The account holder has the right to withdraw deposited funds, as set forth in the terms and conditions governing the account agreement.
