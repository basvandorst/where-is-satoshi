Circle works as well. However, do not keep it on the exchanges. Find a way to secure it via paper wallet or hardware wallet.

Hello Miss Feinstien, please provide me with ALL of your records for my evaluation.
As no encryption can be used, I am sure you will be above board and send me everything without fear of repercussion.
Oh wait, because you are part of the government this doesnt apply to you... PISS OFF

He has a good understanding of the environment. Hopefully more people will get to this point of knowledge regarding the  blockchain.
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:58:39
I concur. Excellent job! 
@_date: 2015-06-23 21:40:59
Also, if its offered for the sites you go to, 2FA. 2 factor authentication. 
Ie. email with a code, or a text to your phone, or something that uses google (or some other) authenticator

Yay Canada!

From another post in this sub.
Read the 2nd paragraph.
I really don't like this guy. Don't know him, but my gut feeling is: "Greasy slimeball that doesnt know the first thing about Bitcoin"
@_date: 2015-05-14 15:18:45
Just signed up! Thanks!!
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:30:41
Wow... how deceptively simple. But I also agree.
@_date: 2017-02-15 17:13:40
Yep! A few years ago i think 70nm was the standard. Was fun to see how the design builds were developing. And all from a independent standpoint at that time.
@_date: 2015-05-14 15:53:23
The Whitepaper (yet again) I figure always a good place to start with a refresher of why we are here!
Thanks again!
@_date: 2015-05-13 22:01:53
Yes it matters, there must be an incentive to use these tokens. Without proper monetary incentive, what purpose/reason would anyone have to mine. 
Without that incentive, there would have been no way to bootstrap this technology to get us where we are now.
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:18:38
LOL! That was my exact comment.
@_date: 2015-05-01 17:37:53
Way to stifle innovation. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:08:59
I would get a true hardware wallet. Trezor or Ledger device.
I personally don't keep any more than I am willing to lose on a mobile device. I understand you dont use the phone often, but in many cases unfortunately "shit can happen and often does"
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:42:21
lol The Hearnia... I love it!
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:45:42
Im curious if he realized this, and decided the community needed a kick in the ass to get moving.
Maybe he WANTED to be the catalyst to get this rolling again. The whole blocksize debate stalled out a LONG time ago.
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:33:45
Lol. Awesome!
@_date: 2016-03-30 16:43:52
That's called being normal! Besides, it was a half an hour of from adulting, so yeah! Go for it!
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:50:03
hah! nice 100 dollar profit/btc in 10 minutes or so! Congrats! 
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:06:01
Difficulty would skyrocket and asics would take over again. Especially miners who want to hedge bets and mine both, sounds ludicrous yet feasible.
@_date: 2016-06-03 19:14:08
This reminds me more of the tech boom of 2k ish.
Back in the day people were asked "what is your Amazon plan" most people blew it off like they were nuts. Now look at Amazon, they have such a HUGE HUGE market share now.
This is the same sort of mentality for the old money type people. If people really think about it, cash already is digital, this isnt that much of a thought shift than what people think. 
That said, it is both a risk and a smart move due to the binary nature of bitcoin, all or nothing. 
Blah "dont invest more than you can afford to lose etc"
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:39:44
And just today I was thinking about updating my credentials to buy from them, guess i will find another way...
@_date: 2017-01-19 21:14:30
Cryptoqueen? Been a long time :D Glad to see things are going well!
@_date: 2017-01-12 18:10:05
Thing is, if they were still working with bitcoin during this last drop, i would have used the service.
Definitely shot themselves in the foot while being chased by a tiger
@_date: 2016-11-03 15:05:40
Technically, you "could" but it would not be efficient at all.
Best bet is to buy from a site. Mining is no longer feasible unless you have free power and many many asic's.
Welcome to the fold, and good luck! 
@_date: 2016-11-03 15:10:04
I gave up mining years ago, just no longer worth it. Best to invest what you might be thinking of buying into a few small chunks of bitcoin at a time.
@_date: 2016-11-03 15:15:21
You would be best to look into an alt coin if you are curious. But simply put, do not expect to make much, if anything by mining on a single computer. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:41:19
Happy birthday!! Satoshi is a genius
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:29:26
Sent the info to a friend. She might be stopping by to try it out :D
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:58:02
Hah... That presentation should be used as a template to get it across to the fiat mindset people.
Pretty good presentation.
@_date: 2016-09-27 22:43:41
Congrats! That was my target too. I hit mine last year.
Gotta get moar!
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:35:35
Ouch. Hope you didn't get caught on the NEOBEE hype either.
RENT on Havelock seems to be doing quite well.
@_date: 2015-04-29 19:16:22
Hah! Awesome!
@_date: 2015-04-23 20:53:22
Rock on and welcome! The rabbit hole is deeper than you can ever imagine. 
I saw you purchased a trezor as well. Good work. I find most new users do not understand the security aspect of it.
@_date: 2015-04-09 21:51:57
First they laugh at you, then they fight with you, then they join you...
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:34:49
I remember that pain! I bought 1 for 1 BTC back in the day.
I was lucky that the pool i was on managed to nail a block.
Still the whole learning process was awesome. Its been a long time since I've had so much fun tinkering with those things.
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:15:03
For me, first it was about the ability to have my computer make money while I was at work.
Then I stuck my head in the rabbit hole, now its more about the disruptive nature of this, and the decentralized aspect and what the technology will bring in the future.
@_date: 2015-04-30 20:43:16
I lost 3... dead ssd, before I learned to backup my dat file
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:16:23
I have had no problems with them. Bought one from them this morning in fact.
Moved it out immediately though.
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:07:57
Yep! Just like it was the previous 17 times (or whatever number its at now)
@_date: 2015-11-20 23:39:09
Amazon mechanical turk (Human input tasks) then sign up to purse.io to use some of the amazon credits to BTC. 
Good luck!
@_date: 2015-10-22 18:16:25
Ugh... I really hate this guy with a passion.
