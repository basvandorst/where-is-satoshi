I paid taxes most of my life. I usually have a job and I was let go. Over paying on taxes and not getting anything back refund time. Thanks for your guys very useful comments. ... He said sarcastically. I am not benefiting off of anyone. I pay my rent I pay my car note, shit I even pay for internet. I don't need the negative comments. Just tell me better ways to buy btc, and ill send you 10$ in BTC.

As I said, I paid taxes and I will once I get another job. I can easily dodge paying taxes without your help. Taxes arn't the problem, if I could pay taxes on my money I have, I would. Look taxes suck we all know that, but I have paid a lot in taxes in my life and im currently out of work and do other things to stay afloat.

3$ for the goal. I wanna read it! @_date: 2015-01-21 22:51:03
How did I tell them? I said use walgreens and coin.mx Coin.mx and walgreens is used by many people to buy vanilla cards and coin.mx is a bitcoin exchange for a reason. Im safe, don't knock me. Just trust me Im good worry about yourself. I spent an hour making the post to make sure I wouldn't have anything incriminating in it. Good luck NSA, Barney dat shit and accept that challenge!

No I didn't. Not even what state I live in. They can try all they want but it won't work ;).
Well good for you but since I have to wait several years for me to get my record expunged, I can't get a job in the field I went to college for. So yeah I turned to a hard life, give me a break, if you were in the same situation and can't even get a job at mcdonalds you would too. People need money, the day what I do becomes legal I will pay taxes on it.

I know it is. But I try to be as safe as possible. The other closet store that sells them is 35 minutes away.

I don't use a credit card, all cash. Maybe they'll get my face but the bitcoins are gone within a few hours. Im telling you bro Im good drop it and move on because if im not worried, its for a reason. I've been doing this for a year now and it all works fine. Thanks anyway for you "concerns". Their is no proof what I used the vanilla reload cards for. And I tumble. Im not stupid iight? Give it up.

Try and find me? ;). Im looking for advice on how to not arrise suspicions about what I do. Not advice on how to dodge paying taxes on money the state or federal government doesn't know I am making. I am just looking for different ways to buy bitcoins forreal. I can't report my income because of my work. Think I want to go to jail again? No so I am asking if someone would answer my fucking question. God damn.
