Double fail. 
Stainless steel is just steel with ~10-11% chromium content by weight. 
Steel is iron with about 1-2% Carbon, by weight.
Ergo: Stainless steel is mostly iron + chromium + carbon.

This is a problem with employee training, not Bitcoin itself. There are better ways of USD -&gt; BTC on the way.

Look again. These listings are for the components IN ADDITION to the iron.  
As per the site "Chemical composition % by mass"
Here is the first listing:
UNS NO: S30100	
C 0.15%
Si 1.00%
Mn 2.00%
P 0.045%
S 0.030%
Cr 18.0%
Ni 6.0%
N 0.10%
If you add that up you get 27.325%. That's what is added to the iron to get that particular alloy of stainless steel.
Also the iron content of the alloy only partially determine it's diamagnetic properties. The magnetic properties of stainless steel are very dependent on the elements added into the alloy, and specifically the addition of nickel in high enough amounts can change the structure from magnetic to non-magnetic. These are called "austenitic" alloys.

No, it's not looking for a problem at all. It's to protect against regulatory burden. If it was suddenly declared that sending Bitcoins was a form of money transmission any business in the United States which sent Bitcoin would be required to get money transmitter licensure in every state in which they did business. 
Credit Unions are federal. There is a whole lot case law which puts them outside of state regulators' reach. 
Not to mention all the other perks that come with being a credit union. ABA registration, the possibility of SWIFT network integration, and so on.

I'm absolutely interested in this, and it's funny you bring it up.  Just today I was reading about the process behind forming a credit union.
Feel free to get in touch with me here or at ryan if you would like to discuss this further.

You're over generalizing the usage of the word "bank". We all want Bitcoin to have a larger user base. In order for that to happen Bitcoin has to work inside of the existing regulatory structure. Like it or not. 
Titles like "bank" mean that organizations and companies are allowed to do more within this regulatory system. For instance the organization in France which is now a "bank" can receive someone's funds directly with an IBAN, instead of having to rely on a bank themselves. This means no one can freeze those funds arbitrarily. This puts more control into the hands of Bitcoin friendly organizations.  It doesn't mean "bank" like Bank of America.
You work with the system before you can become the system. Think of it like a lifeboat. You have to extend a bridge to the sinking ship in order for passengers to change boats.

This is where you're mistaken. You're comparing Bitcoin to other markets which have existed in the past or exist now. In those types of markets exponential growth isn't possible. At no point in history has something like Bitcoin ever existed and as a result there is nothing you can compare it to. There will be an exponential increase in it's value until it levels off, but it's highly doubtfull you will see a massive decrease in price unless something goes wrong with Bitcoin itself, or possibly MtGox.
From a speculative standpoint the price increase is a feedback loop that's directly proportional to interest in Bitcoin. The more people get interested the more is bought and the higher the price goes. The higher the price goes the more news coverage it gets and the more people get interested. This will self-perpetuate until it reaches complete market penetration and/or the amount of people who buy Bitcoin balances out with the rate at which Bitcoin is created. 
That doesn't even take into account the non-speculative interest. You also have things like merchants accepting Bitcoin, people wanting to keep their wealth safe due to things like inflation and the Cyprus bank balance haircut, and so on. 
We're only just seeing the beginning my friend.

Do you happen to know anything about tattoo art? Small font is impossible to get and still have it be legible later. It's not a matter of cost. It's a matter of detail and size. The two are mutually exclusive.
Tattoos are made by a man's hand, not printed like font. This tattoo looks like it was done by a fine line artist to boot.
The problem is that if you want it to be legible without being the size of his entire back the tattoo artist had to change the design. Even getting the Bitcoin address that small it looks like they had to offset the uppercase and lowercase lettering so you could tell the difference.

Brilliant idea. Can you find some sort of documentation or reference that states that private carriers don't have to comply with 39 USC 401, 403, and 404 or that specifically only the USPS does?

It may be simplely written, and trollish, but it's right. PHP is notoriously insecure. He may have spent the countless hours required to write it securely, had people double check is code, or taken all of the other steps needed to make it secure, but on principle alone I would not trust my Bitcoin to any software written in PHP.

I would love to have a piece of software like this. 
Ideally, for me, off the top of my head: 
* The ability to monitor USD and BTC balances at major exchanges 
* Watch specific Bitcoin addresses
* Import Armory watching wallets
* Have USD accounts for managing both sides of an OTC/P2P trader's operation
* Trade tracking. Where you can input something like: I sent this person $X.XX from this USD account named [Name] for $XX.XXXXXXXX BTC, or vice versa. 
* Report useful statistics and data like total amount of trades done with a specific person, average transaction sizes, profit margins, amount going to fees, etc.
* Some sort of account management hierarchy that is modifiable. Basic Example: A user in the management program can have accounts. Accounts can have wallets, wallets can have addresses. Addresses could be moved from wallet to wallet, or wallets can be moved between accounts.

It sounds like an interesting project! I submitted my company email address on the site. I would like to take a look whenever you have open space.

Lack of discipline is why people don't get rich. It pains me to see someone who, say, won the lottery only to be broke and poor 5 years later.
