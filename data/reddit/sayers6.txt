You have a big error in your article. If it went up 800% it'd have a market cap of at least 3.8 trillion. Over 300 billion higher than what your article lists. I'd like to warn everyone about this article, the writer can't even do basic math.
Also your website looks like the type of trash 14 year old me could've made about a decade ago.

...yes, exactly

To get the amount of the increase,  not the total amount of the value of the company, yes.

Lmfao that is a 723% increase not a 823% increase. Holy shit learn how percentages work. By multiplying by 8.23 you are including the initial value of the company in the multiplier, so you need to add 1.00 (100%) other wise you are fucking up the math.
414billion + 823% = total market cap
414billion + 3444billion = ~3.8trillion
Its fucking hilarious that you are so distraught over CNN making an obvious error,  and then you make a simple error too. Have you tried messaging CNN about the article and pointing out the mistake? Probably not, you'd just like to spam your website everywhere.

Because. It is a small error and you seem to go on a tirade because of one error. They happen. It isn't even that big of one, because anyone with a brain can see that there is no way CNN would actually expect a company to increase by 823% in such a small period of time. Especially such a huge company. Going on some sort of vendetta over it just makes you look childish. There are plenty of other reasons CNN looks bad. This really isn't one of them.
And in case you still dont really get the math, a comment I was going to post:
Alright let me try a different route to get you to understand the math. CNN lists the future value of the shares at $1483. Alibaba has 2623m outstanding shares. Multiply shares by cost, gives you market cap. Oh look at that. Its $3.8t~ .

I'm only wasting your time because you can't do math. The very thing you are bitching at CNN for.
