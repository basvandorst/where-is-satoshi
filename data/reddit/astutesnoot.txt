I don't understand. Did you lose the ability to say No?
I've reached a point in my life where I'm comfortable letting "No" be a complete sentence. I highly recommend it.

I am a twice divorced man, and even with that I'm not bitter enough to go to your hate-subreddit. Fuck that. That's some weak ass shit right there.

I think you are missing the point of hookers.

From what I understand, they’re not taxing you on the money you put in to bitcoin. They’re taxing you on the gains. The gains are not your invested income and they’re not already taxed. If you put in $1000, and that is worth $10,000 to you now, $9000 of that is new money for you. That’s the part they will tax.

The whales are using limit orders on Bitcoin exchanges, so they're not seeing transaction fees. GDAX trading never hits the blockchain ; it all just changes hands in the GDAX servers.

The world is filled with shitty people, and those shitty people probably have families.

Not all states have it, and it's not an automatic part of the divorce settlement. It has to be asked for by one party and agreed to by the other or the judge.

I don't think you will be alone in this.

How many divorces have you gone through, mr. expert?

Those don't look stacks of Bitcoin that they're seizing from the cartels.

No company can take away your BTC if you store it in a hardware or a paper wallet.

Yeah, but that's not Bitcoin, that's the company you chose to handle your Bitcoin experience. If we're not supposed to trust the banks, then it makes even less sense to trust the Bitcoin companies. They're all filled with people, and people get greedy. One of the points of Bitcoin is to not have to rely on those people. You just have to worry about managing and securing your BTC on your own to get there though.
