I think company's may switch to other coin's that offer cheaper/free transaction fee's along with almost instant transfer times. I see btc acting more or less like digital gold in the future, simply being a store of wealth for the common person. It would be pretty hard to go to Walmart and try to buy your groceries in gold currency, yet it still holds value. 
This is just my 2 cents though

I agree with you that bitcoins biggest use case right now is in the blackmarkets as a tool people use to sell goods anonymously and then transfer to fiat. 
Do you think its possible to have a future where Crypto's and fiat are both used equally?

P2P loans could solve this. Banks are effectively just secure middleman. Person A puts 5k in the bank. Person B walks in and ask's for a loan of 2500$ to say, buy a car.  The bank will give Person B, person A's money and charge interest on top of it.  They then collect the 2500$ back and pocket the interest without Person A ever knowing his money was lent.

Day trading may work for you, and if it does i recommend you keep doing it. For the vast majority of people however day trading is a quick way to piss away coins. Look at the long term price charts, most if not all of the top 50 coins have done 1000% gain in the last year alone. The farther you go back, the bigger the gains.If thats not a good indicator that holding crypto's long term is a good investment idk what is.

Have some sort of Online exchange of loans, where people who are in need of a loan can put a 'buy offer' or application for a loan with a set interest rate and pay back time. 
The investors that are looking to loan people can either accept one of these loan applications , or create there own "sell offer's" of a certain amount of $/btc for a set amount of interest and time.

They should be looking at ontario instead. Currently ontario is generating so much power that has resulted in a surplus of power. We literally cant use the power as fast as they can make it. There solution? Sell it at a loss to other provinces ( like quebec) and to the US.. the icing on the cake is that we have to pay extremely high hydro rates to make up for these losses :)))
At this point i think ontario's government should be doing whatever they can to entice mining company's to move to ontario, not only could they tax the shit out of them like they do with everything else, but also they could provide them with all the Hydro they would ever need. Just my 2 cents

Haha you are basically the kind of person I was talking about. I mean Bitcoin is secure yes, but if I wanted complete security and privacy Monero would be the clear choice for me, which btw I do not even own Monero. Your assumptions about me are quite hilarious also might I add. I was trying to bring some more open mindedness to you small thinking plebs but tbh what's the point when your going to worship some digital currency like it's going to be the sole savior for the global economy.
Might I add I do agree with your statement of the USD however. I don't think the world's ready for that however and some other currency, probably the Euro would simply take its place.

Bro I would say 100%. Duh, I thought everyone knew BTC was the best thing ever and is gonna be the only coin with any use case. 
BTC gonna make me rich, you rich, and the thousands of other people rich. It's gonna topple governments , and bring power back to the people. Fuck eth, fuck LTC, fuck XRP, it's BTC or nothing because since it's the oldest that makes it the best obviously. Technology doesn't improve over time!!
@_date: 2018-09-06 11:21:14
If Bitcoin drops 5%, all coins will drop atvminimum 5% of there USD worth due to them being linked to btcs price and not the usd.

Firstly, its called a period, you should try using one sometime. 
Secondly, i dont think the silk road creator had any clue who satoshi was (IF satoshi was a real person - really big IF) but instead “satoshi” saw the huge global need for an annoynomous peer to peer decentralized payment system. 
It just so happened that the silk road was created after bitcoin had already been around for a couple years. They definitely helped each other grow, getting btc more daily traffic and more people mining, and the silk road for being able to have drugs delivered to your doorstep anonymously.
To answer your original question, no. They most likely had no clue who the other was, but i don’t think either of them would have become as successful as they are (were in silk roads case) without the help from the other

Figure out what you want to invest in, if your more interested in the technology / passive income buy bitcoin/altcoins, if your looking to start a somewhat expensive hobby with currently mininimal income but the potential to make a career out of it , id say mining is more for you

Question for you from Canada!
Are the people that held Bitcoin pre inflation now for the most part wealthier then those who didn't?
What's the current exchange rate of your bolivares to Bitcoin, and are people still actively buying Bitcoin post inflation?
Has adoption increased since inflation? IE do more stores and people now accept Bitcoin, or prefer it over the bolivares? 
One more non Bitcoin related question, how is the struggle going in your country between the old president / prime minister, and the new one Western powers see as legitimate?

The fact they recovered any at all is amazing. I'm not sure how the US Government just comes into possession of 28 bitcoins (that's shady af to me) but at least the original investors acquired all there losses back.

I think OP was talking more about investing in Bitcoin or other crypto’s through a bank instead of private company’s like coinbase?

Day trading between alts and btc can be quite profitable. I dont pay attention to $$ value’s when i trade, i base all my trade’s on sat value’s, and i think alot of other people trade like this to. For me its honestly a pain switching btc to My native currency and that would cause a taxable event (i know each trade is taxable but il deal with that when i eventually do cash out)so for now im collecting satoshi’s, keeping money in the market and hoping btc goes to the moon

Dont worry about it. Stop looking at price’s every day and what the short term market’s doing. Your in the first 1% of people to own btc globally, you WILL make money long term i guarantee it. So why stress yourself over short term fluctuations? Btc’s gonna do what btc does
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:27:37
As long as it cost less to mine a btc then the current price (which in most countries it does) btc will succeed. As far as I’m aware countries such as south korea, canada (ontario specifically) and other countries who’s hydro is at a premium may never have big mining infrastructures due to the low level of profitability. However i read an article that Venezuela has the cheapest mining rates, costing only 500$ to mine 1 btc 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:46:28

@_date: 2018-07-12 10:26:28
Yeah i agree with that logic i guess, but that doesn’t mean I’m not right either. A few people bought at 100, 200 or even 1000, but the vast majority did not.
All i was trying to say is if you constantly compare BTC to its ATH you aren’t going to be happy with your investment for quite some time. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:50:54
There isn’t to my knowledge, what im saying is it takes any knowledgeable investor about 20 seconds to figure out if there coin is doing well vs bitcoin or not. 
Also is it comparing coins to btc over this last year? Or a year ago today? Because they would have 2 completely different outcomes

Great question. The only thing I could think of is the planet was enormous but not very dense. The amount of mass the planet had , affected the space time very severely the closer to the center you would go, simply due to the size and overall mass of the planet.
Super strong gravitational pulls come from very dense objects , which is why black holes are well black. There so dense that the gravitational pull out of the anomaly is greater then the speed of light. This means you could have say a beach ball sized black hole with more mass then a planet like the one in the movie.
I'm no astrophysicist , and I would love if someone would or could correct me. But that's my basic understanding on how gravity / mass effects space time

To further on this. If it were possible to stand on the edge of a black hole event horizon, or even in to it, I'd guess that the difference in space time you'd experience would be FAR greater then on a planet like this. If you want to hold, this would be the place
