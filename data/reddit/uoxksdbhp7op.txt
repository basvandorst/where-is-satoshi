Well let's be clear:  It wouldn't take "a second" for it to be detected - it would probably take a few hours at least for the news to hit all the right people and have them coordinate a response (assuming they are awake at the time).  In that time, it would be possible execute several bogus transaction to purchase "real" goods or currencies on the exchange.  ...not to mention cause significant credibility damage to Bitcoin (and the attacker would probably also be shorting bitcoin - or at least trading volatility on the exchanges). 
So while the currency itself is resilient, and will survive, this would be an extremely profitable attack.   I agree with OP that we will inevitably see an increase in the # of required confirmations.    ....and for those who trust BTGuild not to do this because it would be self defeating - that isn't the point.  Someone could coerce, sabotage, or infiltrate BTCGuild to make it happen.  Do you expect Mr BTCGuild to refuse injecting some bogus code to the nodes if he literally has a gun pointed to his head?
I really really hope that the heads of mining guilds and exchanges are taking their personal security seriously.  There is too much money in this now.

I have a quasi-related noob question.  I finally dug through my computer and found my old wallet with 100BTC from mining a while ago.  What is the passphrase for?  I remembered it after a few tries, but I'm not clear when I'll be prompted for it...  Will it ask me for it when I try to send them to another address?  Also, what is My address?  I see two addresses on the two 50BTCs that I mined - are both of those my addresses, or does the wallet have it's own address?
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:30:21
Same sad thing happened to me.  I built this kick ass computer to mine coins, managed to mine 100, and then the market crashed and I ended forgetting about it and getting a job - tried looking for it again, but between then and now I reinstalled windows and reformatted the drive.  ...and with Steam running I've filled up the drive several times, so I know it's wiped.   
Worst. decision. ever.
EDIT: Although, congrats to all the peeps out there who made money - your vision earned it.  I hope the fact that I destroyed 100 BTC makes everyone a little happier :)   ...so the BTC markets is actually $180 * 11.999900 million :)

I have noticed the same thing.  The executions don't seem to match what on the open order book.  They are executing at regular intervals right between the spread (i.e. not at either bid or ask).
It seems fishy, and honestly, there's a pretty big motive for them to do this...  I suppose it could be a bot - but who would write a bot that executes multiple trades at the exact same price and exact same quantity (and actually get a full fill EVERY TIME)?

@_date: 2013-04-12 14:23:25
I put together the valuation model based on information in this paper:  .
Essentially, the duration a merchant can hold a BTC without risking a price swing multaplicatively influences the value of the currency. Before BTC was popular, the volatility was low enough to sustain a $10-$15 valuation - and that's where it converged.  Ironically, with the recent rise and price swings, the currency becomes worthless.  If this continues, I would be amazed if even Silk Road didn't liquidate 99.99% of their BTC and keep them only for a minute during the transaction.
I believe in Bitcoin, and I want it to succeed, but I want people to be aware of how a currency works.  The "value" of a currency is not derived by the value of the things you buy and sell with it - it is derived from the supply and demand of the money supply (actual BTC available/in demand for purchase with EUR/USD), which is directly correlated to the duration merchants will hold the money.
@_date: 2013-05-02 17:15:23
You can google currency valuation models, but they all essentially boil down to supply/demand via...
(transaction value volume in USD per unit of time) / (available money supply - ie 11MM BTC minus estimated savings and transactional holding time)
You have to be careful to factor in merchant holding periods. ...and that's the key, because it is based on volatility.  If you assume a merchant will only tolerate a 5% swing in value, then the holding period is very low (like 1 hour), and while that drives the efficiency of the currency high, it in turn drives the price in USD of it way down.
The value is HIGHLY dependent on volatility. Plugging in today's vol and transaction volumes, the USD value of BTC is actually under a dollar.  If it were to stabilize and capture the majority of international currency market (over 1 Trillion in transactions), it would be valued at over $1500/BTC.
So the difference between $1 and the current price of ~$100 is purely speculation on it becoming something very big - the underlying fundamentals don't support that value.

Just be aware you are going to pay 1% on cash withdrawal on you ATM (maybe), 2% to use BitFloor fee, then a BitFlorr transaction fee of 0.5%, then their market has BTC about 10% higher cost than elsewhere because there are so many people doing this exact same thing.

Right, but if I have a balance of 100 BTC, and I send only 50 BTC, I need to share my private key with the network to confirm the transaction.  Of course, the remaining 50 BTC can't stay in the same address because I've shared the private key, so it goes to a "change" address.  ....but if I've previously backed up my wallet - then the backup won't contain the change address and I won't be able to recover my change in the backup.  So any time I *send* money, I need to re-backup my wallet in order to backup the change.

Stability comes when the majority of market transactions are non-speculative - actual Bitcoin economy transactions.  Over time, as Bitcoin becomes more popular, the volatility will go down.  It is a gradual process.  One thing is for sure.

The question is actually a little broader than that...  Since there are only a few providers of BTC-&gt;USD (the exchanges), and since you can send BTC to/from any of them and withdraw from there - you have lots of options as to where to withdraw USD.  The *real* question is - what if there was a sell-off?  Would all the providers of USD actually have sufficient cash to provide?
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:35:50
There are.  Use google.  Anyone can run a miner solo.  The problem is that the payout are so far apart, no one wants to wait for their jackpot

I thought LR was just holding fiat... I don't think they were actually creating an e-gold/LibertyDollars/BTC type alternate currency.

I'm pretty sure their faking their volume numbers to make themselves look like major players.

Yes, it's fine to transfer whenever you want.  I think the hole system is on hold until the exchange starts in 30 mins.

No, I didn't know that.  I don't think I said anything offensive.  In reality, I want the current set of leaders in the BTC market to start taking their personal security seriously.  They are in a position to swing the market hundreds of millions of dollars.  Nefarious elements of the underworld are going to take notice...
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:48:42
Is there another?
@_date: 2013-05-25 15:24:37
Liberty Reserve was a conduit of money in/out of BTC.  If you cut the conduit, would people want to use more or less BTC?   Obviously, they would use LESS BTC because they realize that other conduits may get cut as well, which ultimately renders BTC worthless.

Look at what happened in the eGold case.  After ten years in court, former eGold customers were permitted to file paperwork with the US gov't to prove ownership and origin of their account and were allowed return of the remaining portion of their funds.

...and, honestly, it won't even really be their fault because the IRS will likely take until mid-2014 to figure out how to handle this.   Then they will try to use underpayment as a reason to audit people so this is the best way to protect yourself without declaring anything.

A wall more than 2-3 dollars away is almost meaningless.  People put up HUGE walls to fake interest.

Paying 110% of your 2012 taxes isn't actually paying more (because it's just a credit on 2013 taxes) - it's actually strategy to pay LESS!

Quite honestly, the largest market for BTC is still Silk Road, so don't think BTC is somehow sitting in an ivory tower.

So if I backup a wallet, then send some BTC out, is my backup still valid, or do I lose everything in the "change" address?

You should look to your employees for additional servers - very often tech employees can supplement temporarily in a pinch.
@_date: 2013-05-02 17:45:50
Well, the answer is that it depends.  At a price of exactly 100, it's probably not just one buyer - but if you see a price of 101.03921, then yeah, probably only one guy decided to buy/sell at that price.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:52:01
It went down to 45 in between, but it seems stable now.  Which makes sense, because this is basically the pre-bubble price.  It'll actually be a pretty good buying opportunity if it stays stable.
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:00:38
The Cypriots went to the Russians, not because they actually wanted to strike a deal with the Russians, but as a bargaining tactic with the Europeans.  It was a veiled threat (that marginally paid off).  The threat of Russia having a claim in the mediterranean forced the EC to sweeten the offer (a little).

After doing a little more reading it looks like I DO need to backup my wallet anytime I spend any of it...

I sort of disagree...  It seems to me to be pretty unlikely that all these trades were fully filled and executed at the exact same price for the exact same quantity...

All power corrupts eventually.  The original good guys will retire, die, be pushed aside, or sabotaged in some way.  In the end (maybe 15 years from now), as long as there's a miner's guild, it will be no different than the group of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, etc... that we have now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:52:13
Yes... but it is adaptive.  The trouble with regulation is that in an effort to smooth out the currency, they end up just propping it up artificially until the country collapses.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:58:32
Obviously not...  The current volatility is unacceptable, even for BitPay to function.  It puts a huge negative pressure on the value of the currency.  It doesn't mean it will fail, it just means it will be valued at about a dime per coin.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:44:22

Transactions costs do not influence the price, just the intermediate liquidity.
@_date: 2013-05-25 21:41:46
You might see it again.  After a number of years of court cases, it's likely that the seized assets will be liquidated to the companies creditors, of which you are one.  Collect all your records on how much you had in your account, all the account details/emails that you have, all the documents on where you got the money to deposit in LR, and maybe, one day, you'll be able to get a portion of your money back.  ...there will likely be a fair amount of paperwork involved.  Look up what happened to the eGold customers.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:13:58
If the exchanges setup checking/savings services, I wouldn't need to have a shitty bank that still uses wire transfers and charges me 1% on cash withdrawals.

Yes, it's correct.  Look at bitcoin.clarkmoody.com

We need to talk about **SECURITY**.  Simply listing out these alternate exchanges is woefully insufficient.  Who owns them, where are the servers located, are they encrypting/salting their password, are they protected against XSS or SQL injection, 2-step authentication, *secure facilities* etc...
With the BTC price over $100, some of us have very large sums of money that we'll only trust with very high security companies.  I'm not even happy with MtGox, but at least I know they are based in a country where armed thugs won't just burst into their office and order them to hand over all the BTC (*cough*Poland, Hong Kong, Slovenia *cough*).   
There is so much money at play now that I have a feeling we are going to see a huge string of **major** heists...
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:01:12
They are likely keeping a large number of them in the "testing" lab...  Wouldn't you?

If it's a really old version, backup the wallet before using the new client. There can be some weird behavior where it keeps temp version of the wallet.  Then create a new wallet, encrypt, and transfer to it

Thank you for answering this important question.  Let's hope the other exchanges follow your example.

Usually they pair it with the top seller, and split the difference between the ask and bid.  That's how the NYSE does it.

The exchange prop up the BTC price by about 90%. ...so this has a pretty big impact on us all.
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:31:02
That's a fallacy.  The idea that the *currency* is tied to the value (market cap) of a *company* that it might disrupt is completely apples and oranges.  I think that's what's falsely propping up the market...

Assuming LR kept everyone's deposits on hand, it will probably be a similar process to the eGold seizure, where after about 10 years of court cases people had to submit several forms with the US government to reclaim (whatever portion is left) of their money.   I assume you needed to prove your identity against the account, how you got the money (i.e. proving it wasn't drug sales), whether it is taxable, etc...
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:39:12

...and launder money.  Seriously online drug purchases using Bitcoin is a $20 million dollar business, and it's growing by double each year.  Money laundering is a 1 Trillion dollar business that has woken up to Bitcoin as the perfect exchange currency.

It says you're exempt from any penalty if you pay 100% of prior year (but then caveats that it's 110% if your AGI for current year is over 150K).
...and since people are making money hand over fist, I figure it's better to pay 110% now anyway (it's still just a credit against 2013 taxes anyway).
