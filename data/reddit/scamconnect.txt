What I am saying here is not by any means a detailed report of what happened. Don't have much time so here is TLDR. 
Reasons for haircut:
1) Huge capital flow in Cyprus for laundering up to 2012. Loans were given as candy and people took them. If they did grade 1 calculations they would see they could never repay them. Also some either mortgaged or took them without any guarantees.
2) Laiki Bank had indications of failing in 2012. They had insufficient capital and desperately looking for investors. None took notice. (Country's 2nd biggest lender)
3) Big exposure to Greek economy(Big story).
Laiki was either going to bankrupt and close or the depositors were going to be saved the minimum 100,000. (In addition to some other stuff such as government debt, liquidity etc) This lead to the well known haircut of 2013.
Banks were closed. Limited amount could be transferred. However the branches of Bank of Cyprus in UK and Russia etc were open. Some took their money out (22mil). There are lists of who did this.
Lets get into the haircut stuff. A newly elected government promised there was going to be no haircut. 15th of March bail-in by Troika proposal, take it or leave it at 6.75% haircut under 100k and 9,9% over 100k (For every account in every bank in Cyprus).  Everyone is shocked! 19th the proposal is declined by parliament. Realize we are in deep shit. New proposal merge Laiki and Bank of Cyprus (Split bad and good assets big story). The only bank that was haircut was Bank of Cyprus. The rest is quite confusing. Looking for a single number is not the way to look at it. Here is the bank announcement  
That 22.5% buffer, 10% was later decided be added to the initial 37.5% to make the 47.5% number the article says. The rest frozen funds were slowly unfrozen in the upcoming year. What happened to the stocks is a quite confusing and a whole story by itself.
So lets see. Only the amount above 100k was haircut (converted in stocks) in a single bank instead from everyone. You decide which is better. 
I been warning people the problem was not gone. The loans that were given still could not be repaid. They made fun of me. Laughed at bitcoin and gold. After 5 years. Guess what? The loans that were given still are NPL. The Coop Bank that was acquired by the government and currently being auctioned off to Hellenic Bank. (People earlier this year shit their pants that the Coop bank might bankrupt and the safe deposit up to 100k might not hold, fun stuff) Billions invested into the bank by the government in order for it to even be sell-able (Huge story read more on it). Taxpayers will have to pay up. We are in huge financial trouble and we deserve every single thing that happens to us. We are sheep and sheep are meant to be haircut.
And there goes my time.
Edit: In case I didn't make it clear,  Laiki depositors got up to 100k, the insured amount, because the bank defaulted. Shareholders got 0. Bank of Cyprus depositors got above 100k deposits  47.5% of their deposit in stocks( e.g 400k deposit  400k-100k =  300k  , 300k *0.475 of their money converted into stocks ). People who owned bank bonds and stock got screwed by the process. Rest of banks remained untouched but still in deep shit even today.

I am from Cyprus and this is 99% bullshit. I believe in Bitcoin but you guys don't know shit about our shitty cursed fucking island. Selectively picking outdated news is just pathetic. Don't use Cyprus as an example or do in full context.
