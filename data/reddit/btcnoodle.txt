I have a bunch of BFL units. Overall they've been performing as expected. I have had three occasions where I needed to request an RMA and they replaced the units within a week of me creating the RMA request. So, I see lots of folks are using your thread to bash BFL but to answer your question, all you have to do is log on to your account dashboard, create a new rma request, wait for them to approve it and then ship the unit to them. I've been a customer since the fpga days and while fully aware of the history I must admit that they seem to be trying to rally. Don't count BFL out just yet.

While a sad state of affairs overall for humanity, the Crimea/Ukraine situation seems to be the beginning of the end of the petro dollar. Everyone will have their own opinion of the merits or hazards of this. The divestment has already begun in earnest and if the sanctions are actually implemented then we will see a full scale west vs east financial war. The extent of the planned sanctions is severe. It seems to me inevitable that a flight from the dollar will see some of the outflow going into crypto. Thoughts?

This is a good question and I think identifies one of the still missing pieces. I'm going to look more into TAHOE, not familiar with it. I suppose in my headspace the VMs would be controlled by the protocol with no access to the data, including memory at the node level. At least the memory would be encrypted somehow. Using multi-sig encryption for consensus might help with this. We still need a memory centric 'coin' (RAMcoin) that to my knowledge doesn't yet exist. super3 raised the issue of proof of work for each of these areas. What if the proof of work was not performed on each particular resource but in conjunction with another resource? For example, what if the proof of bandwidth production came from a combination of recpt ack from all the other 'coin'? If we're talking about some sort of mining/proof or work concept it can't use all the system resources as part of the process. The proof of work for bandwidth could be a hash from the memory and hdd components? I'm trying to brainstorm here, it's a process.

My question is where did the two forensic investigators get the tip that he was into model trains? That's the lead that led them to him. They are good enough at their craft to get inside the head of their target. So they would have actively looked for hobbies, interests, history etc. I don't recall anything that indicated he was a model train enthusiast. Unless I'm missing something this detail would have had to come from a close source. It almost feels like a parallel construction.

I don't mind changing my purchasing habits to support the bitcoin economy. Even if the offering were less attractive I would still support btc based businesses on the philosophy alone, but that's just me. That being said I still prefer as a consumer to do business with merchants who understand my needs. Accepting btc is a huge plus in this regard so I think it's a clever move on their part. This coming year will be very disruptive to the status quo as those who embrace btc begin to pull ahead and those who resist wither.

I think I may have been their first btc customer. I'm happy to report that everything has gone smoothly. When the first thread about it started I decided to look more into it as I live in Nicaragua and have a hard time getting good selection and prices here. My first test order was something from amazon.com, ordered with a gyft card of course. Once it arrived at their warehouse I got an email notification including pictures of the item on the conveyor belt. I was able to then select my shipping options and it went out to Nicaragua the same day. 
I wonder if they realize what a big deal this is? I can now order pretty much anything in the world with bitcoin and have it delivered in the least hassle-free way possible. Being able to pay with bitcoin for intl is huge since credit cards always have problems with shipping to foreign addresses.
A new link in the global logistics chain has been forged....powered by bitcoin. This is the promise of crypto currency in action. Thanks for giving it a chance John!

Of the 4 miners I bought from them 3 are having serious problems. 2 of the 4 only hash at half speed due to one of the cores dying. One of them hashes at 3/4 speed. When I'm talking about speed I am of course referring to the 1.6 th/s speed we actually got, not the 2th speed we paid for. Of course I have submitted about a dozen polite support requests for RMA and haven't heard a peep. So, a $24k investment producing half of what they said it would. I hardly ever post a grievance on a public forum as I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, hoping they'll come through. In this case I have to agree with the sentiment of the thread, they have utterly failed.

These are limits that have existed since the introduction of CPU clustering and have more to do with the limitations of how to develop massively parallel apps then security. I think the big issue here is how can we take advantage of the innovations around crypto-currency to actually achieve a decentralized implementation? Of course it will be crude at first but if the platform works then people will jump on board because they understand it's the new paradigm. Over time it will get better as long as it retains consensus. Regarding your specific example of CPU/RAM security, seems you would want the ability to do both BOINC like and private and then price them according to what the market will bear.

I can personally confirm clients who have received 3 of their units and all perform flawlessly. After waiting 1 yr 4 months for a BFL order I am very happy with the relatively short wait for cointerra. terraminehosting on the other hand seem to be pissing people off left and right with their poor customer service. They have a production line that can crank out massive units but I think they're making some adjustments to the board to try and get the output up to the 2th target. They may not be perfect but they make the best miner money can buy. Definitely not a scam. I think your accusation is out of line with reality.

Any feedback from the viewer side would be valuable.

I was actually thinking namecoin would be useful for storing the encrypted data needed to handle the initial negotiation. While you can not encrypt memory per se you can encrypt the data being moved in and out of memory at the application level. With namecoin you can have all of this tied to a .bit domain that you control. XenServer is extensible enough to allow all of this. You are correct that this is not possible with current technology, which is why I am proposing ideas for a new method. My ideas may be full of holes but we have to start somewhere.

Corruption of witnesses, extortion, forgery of subpoenas and conspiracy to deny a citizens rights all under color of law is enough to cast reasonable doubt on the claim of crimes. Only a moron would think he got a fair trial.
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:35:34
Well, the short answer is that once they used their position to generate fake documents that forbid someone from expressing themselves freely any evidence and witnesses should be considered tainted. They attempted to extort money from several entities and used their official capacity to intimidate people into keeping quiet. All of this under a false claim of lawful authority. Are you seriously trying to say that the information was not relevant to the defense? My main point is that this could extend beyond just the trial and just these two agents. So, sorry to inform you but the public opinion will not be as limited as the narrow confines of consideration imposed upon that sham of a trial.

That they weren't 'rogue' operatives at all but acting under direction from their superiors as part of a multi-agency operation. How many more parties have yet to come forward with evidence of other crimes and other agents involved? Are we supposed to believe that top agents from two different fed agencies were so stupid? I think their story stinks and that they and their agencies have probably been behind much more than is being told so far. In short, the crimes may extend well beyond just these two individuals and it is common practice for criminals to attempt to cover their tracks by putting forward a scapegoat. They want people to think it was two bad apples targeting a killer. What if the rabbit hole goes deeper? Let's not get so gobsmacked with the drama of the story as to forget how rotten these would be tyrants really are. I think the story will continue to evolve.

It just so happens I'm working on this. I haven't been on a specific time table with it so since you asked I'll put a priority on the options for cacao. I have direct contact with producers and have been trying to use crypto to create a next level for the fair trade concept. No promises but give me a couple of days to look into it. Feel free to msg me directly.
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:28:16
Bitcoin would probably be the only payment method I would accept so that's great. I am going to move it up in the priorities and will be sure to let you know once I have a working unit that I can demonstrate to be working for an s9. The biggest cost for me is going to be getting an s9 so I can properly test it. Logistics, costs, etc. I was planning on doing this once the new facility is finished but I will now try and work on it as resources permit. Again, I don't want to accept any money until I know I have it working and available. Thanks for the interest. I'll be back.
@_date: 2016-07-11 03:10:26
There are lots of factors I will need to consider in order to give you a solid answer on that. Let me sleep on it and get back to you tomorrow, been a long day here. I want to try to minimize the ship times but need to make sure I have all the logistics sorted as well as a plan to test the unit to make sure it works as intended. It's just scaling up what I already have tested so I don't anticipate a problem there. The rig I have now was built to work with the most popular miners at that time which were in the 350 watt range. As it has evolved the watt range now is in the 1200-1500 range. The design can be scaled up by adding additional components in parallel. I'll get back with you on it. Thanks for the interest!
@_date: 2016-07-10 17:53:58
In order to do a fully stand alone system you need to make two changes;
-replace the 10 amp charge controller with as many of these 40 models in parallel as needed to achieve the desired amperage. for an s9 2 should do it;
- Next change is to add a DC timer into the loop between the lamp controller out and the relay activation leads. This is one I like;
Solar panels will hook to the charge controller unlike in the DC power supply only scenario. DC timer is programmed to start miners in the morning once there is normally good charging and off in the evening as you start to lose good charging conditions.
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:35:51
Yes, I have had a working prototype running 2 s5 for about two years (see picture in twitter link above). I have run miners on solar with this custom DC-DC power system and using the standard inverter setup as well as grid tie. The way I am doing it now is the culmination of all of that experience.
I have considered doing something with this as a biz but decided to open source the key stuff so as to help with the decentralization of mining. I am very passionate about solar energy in general and feel that crypto mining on solar power has huge benefits. I decided I wanted to open source anything useful I come up with in order to promote decentralization. I still have some ideas of how to monetize it as well. Short answer is I like the mining community and like to help out when I can. I have considered building and selling just the power supply unit. That's the heart of the system.
I called myself retiring here from the US about a decade ago. After a career in IT. I wound up doing lots of interesting tech projects here and solar bitcoin mining is my latest passion.
Last point, the s9 is the best miner to use in my opinion. The s5 can be bought used cheap and will allow you to load test the system but for production the s9 is the clear choice.
@_date: 2016-07-10 17:41:20
After considering our discussion on this I can tell you for sure what I would do if I were in your situation. Since you already have a solar system in place and not starting from scratch you will need a DC-DC switching power supply to replace the AC inverter. I still have never seen one for sale that is suitable for mining so I would build my own to run a single ant s9 based on the design I have tested extensively running 2 ant s5. The design to run 2 s5 is pulling about 700 watts so we need to scale that up to do about 1400 watts. To get right to it these are the parts you'll need, I'll explain in a bit how it will need to be put together and how I came to this design in the first place. After I get all that out I will try to answer some of the other questions folks have about a fully stand alone system. For your needs you will only need the DC power supply/switch/regulator.
2 of these (note it's a 5 pack so you'll be getting 10 relays total. 8 will be used) about $28
1 of these about $70
10 of these about $200
Those three items are an mppt charge controller that will be used to control the relays. The 12v relays which will allow you to safely control the power switching and voltage regulators to make sure the power stays clean so as not to damage your gear.
Here's how it goes together, note that all regulators and relays will be hooked in parallel to allow us to get to the desired total amperage;
- DC 12 volt power bus (battery main) gets hooked to the charge controller, powering it up in the 12v range. 
- Negative bus lead connects to the regulator negative.
-Positive bus lead connects to relay pass in
- Relay pass out 12v positive lead connects to regulator positive.
- Relay 'activate power' leads get connected to 'lamp controller' on charge controller.
- Regulator positive and negative out connect to miner power cables (pci-e)
Once this is connected as such pressing the orange button on the charge controller front panel will activate the relays allowing power to flow to the regulators which will then even it out and pass it to a secondary bus which will then have the miner power cables hooked to it and power the miners.
By using the lamp controller feature of the charge controller you get low voltage protection. If the batteries get low (even though sounds like you won't have much of a problem with that) the lamp controller will power down the relays and therefore stop the miners. It will automatically reconnect when the battery charge comes back up to safe level.
The idea is to have all this in a box with cooling fans (12v dc case fans) and size it to power a single miner. This box of parts gives you about a 15% efficiency boost over using a big inverter. The cost of an inverter to do this is about $2000, my solution costs about $300, thus dramatically reducing total system costs and allowing a modular approach that will scale while limiting down time due to equipment failure.
@_date: 2016-07-22 16:53:28
Just paste the private key in where it asks for the seed. Pretty sure it will automatically detect it's a private key and proceed accordingly.
@_date: 2016-07-09 21:00:34
Yeah, that's all good info. I love pure DC systems. So you would probably have no problem getting a 12v line. In order to do this without an inverter you're basically going to need a DC voltage regulator with relays and a means of regulating the voltage. I have specific gear for all this I've tested in continuous use, all bought from amazon (china imports). Someone posted a script they wrote I noticed to monitor voltage. That may come in handy. I've been using a small charge controller for that function which in turn controls the relays.
I'm doing a few things today so please let me get some notes together and post a little later when I have it better organized. Sounds like you have enough batteries to mine around the clock but you will ultimately get less this way than having more miners running during charging hours. Still for a start you may want to go 24x7 with fewer miners. I use a DC timer to control the relays when I need to mine only during charging hours so that's easy to add in later if needed.
You're going to want to go ahead and start with a ant s9 instead of buying older used miners, trust me. As someone pointed out we're leveling off now on Moore's law so the s9 should give you a long service life. Even a bfl jalapeno will still mine without having to turn it off but the efficiency advantage of the s9 makes it the best choice clearly.
All this might sound a bit rube goldberg but I have gone out of my way to make a design that could be replicated and scaled. I'm working on version 3 of the design now. version 2 ran in service for over a yr with no problems. Taking the opportunity to make a few final tweaks before I start trying to upgrade my s5s to s9s. It's a simple design really but the trick is having a fully tested configuration with an accurate parts list. Since I have already worked that out I can hopefully reduce your risks by sharing the info.

I'm in Nicaragua. I developed a fully stand alone system because we don't have any kind of grid buy back here. For me fully stand alone is the only option. Plus I like the fact that I have gained independence from the power companies :-)

Just a side note, I'm confident enough with all this that I have already acquired property here and have begun building a solar mining facility. I'm self funding so it's slow but I'm making good progress. It's only in the last about six months that I felt my design was good enough to start scaling up.
@_date: 2016-07-09 20:29:28
Gotcha. This could turn into a lot of Q and A but let's try and fast forward that a bit with a few key questions;
- What's your inverter situation? Do you have surplus inverter capacity for say, a couple thousand watts? If not you will want a 12v based system like what I have come up with.
- Can you run a 12v line from your battery bank without getting a lopsided charge? What's your battery bank voltage?
If you have to start adding inverter capacity then you're better off building a custom 12v distribution system like I'm using.
Also, when you run the numbers it's far more profitable to mine only during charging hours than to try and have enough battery capacity to run all night. You just have to accept and live with that unless you have tons of batteries already. I got to a 10 yr ROI with the brute force approach and through all improvements combined have it now in the 3-4 yr range. That's based on current btc price so if the price goes up the ROI comes much faster.
In your case you've got nothing to lose but you obviously want to make the most of your efforts. Let me know about those questions above and I can determine if my 12v approach is right for you.
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:05:47
I'm in Nicaragua. The solar mining facility is going to be on the Island of Ometepe. Don't get to Cali too often but thanks for the offer, very generous.
As far as getting an s5 going, let me sort of back up and talk concepts for a bit. The post before with all the tech details is important but I may have glossed over a few things in trying to get that hammered out.
First, not everyone knows but miners all run at 12 volts DC. When you hook one up to an AC outlet you are using the PSU (power supply) as an AC to DC transformer. The PCI-E cable that plugs directly into the miner is 12v. So what I have referred to as the brute force approach is a standard solar system with a miner plugged into a big inverter AC out. You have a battery bank that is DC and an inverter connected to the batteries that convert the DC to AC. The PSU then converts that BACK to DC for the miners to use. This is all very inefficient and costly. It is possible to use pure DC to run the miners but you have to address a few design concerns to do it right. Those design elements include voltage regulation for a stable 12 volts and a means to safely turn them on and off without having huge sparks fly every time they get connected. You also need to have a low voltage disconnect method to prevent your batteries from getting damaged. It is notable that miners can tolerate some voltage variation but you still need to keep within a tight range.
The design I explained before takes all that into account.
You basically have two options to get an s5 going;
1-build a DC-DC power system like I described or
2-buy a 1000 watt inverter and run the miner with a standard PSU
option 1 costs much, much less if you can figure out how to put it together. Charge controller 'lamp controller' is used to control power to the relays. Powering the relays connects the power main to the regulators. Regulators connect to miners with a clean 12v output. Charge controller automatically shuts off relays when low voltage condition occurs, automatically back on when charge levels come back up.
I think your idea to put a 'mining pod' at each greenhouse is great.

Here's a picture of my rig from a screenshot done as the Streamium team were watching a stream of it mining live. It's from their twitter account;
It's a little blurry but will allow you to see how I arranged the components. This is a fully stand alone system that uses an awesome 500 farad graphene capacitor instead of batteries. This is due to the fact that batteries just don't stand up to the discharge cycle (unless they're ni-fe batteries). For larger scale mining I think edison batteries would be the way to go but the graphene capacitor works like a champ and is easier to get started with. The rig in the pic is everything to it except for the panels on the roof. No other batteries than the capacitor seen in the pic.
@_date: 2016-07-10 23:31:08
To summarize from all the scattered posts...I have used this exact method with 2 ant s5 which is about 700 watts. The modifications I am suggesting I have not tested but it is based on my nearly 2 yrs running the rig shown in the picture I linked to in a tweet. I plan to apply the same upgrade to my system so what I suggested is what I plan to upgrade to when I can. The tweet from streamium is a screenshot from a live stream video of the unit mining. I ran that for three days and numerous people paid me to watch it run. I am giving you the result of much effort of actual testing of the exact components I listed. You will have to determine the degree of certainty, no warranty express or implied. I'm not just making it up, I really designed and built this thing and it works great. I am not just speculating that the components will work together as described.
@_date: 2016-07-09 19:57:31
Hi, I've been a solar miner for about 4 yrs now. I have invented a new power control system to eliminate the need for costly inverters and also figured out pretty much every other detail needed to make it work. Everyone saying it's not worth it are just wrong. I did have to innovate a number of things to make it work though. I started with the 'brute force' approach of using a huge inverter with tons of batteries but have managed to increase profitability significantly through a series of lessons learned and applied.
Short answer is go for it. You can improve efficiencies as you go and it will be a great learning experience. FYI, if you go back and look at the Streamium debut I was the guy streaming video of my solar miner which got a fair amount of attention at that time. offgridmining.com is mine although it's really dated considering where I am with it all now. Been too busy inventing to worry about publishing. But since you asked I'm happy to share.

@_date: 2016-07-10 13:31:57
It's a moving target really but I'm in the 3-4 yr ROI range now. I have also done mining on grid power but the solar design I have now offers enough advantage to make it (at least for me) the clear choice. I will never mine on anything except solar at this point. Btw, this ROI is significantly better than the payback of your solar system using conventional valuation of kw/h produced at going market rates. That usually takes about 10 yrs. When I think about all the money I have spent on now obsolete miners I wish I could have started with the solar design I have now.
@_date: 2016-07-11 02:30:07
If I were to sell the power system I would do it on a cost plus basis. Since I plan to open source the design my target market would be people who would rather pay me to build it than to do it themselves. So probably like $500-600 range. Remember it's really important to me that this is accessible to home miners so I want to keep the price point on the lower side. I need to price in enough to pay for the assembly and materials.
As far as solar in the desert, that's ideal conditions. The charging conditions are like best case scenario because of the low average cloud cover and your proximity to the equator.
If you had one s9 running 24x7 it would earn (at present difficulty) 0.46 btc per month. The difficulty can change of course but as a solar miner this is actually a strength instead of a liability. You never have to unplug your solar miner. Grid miners have to shut down when it costs more to run it than it makes. When grid miners start shutting down your proportional piece of the pie goes up and you're grinning. If you run only during charging hours (an 8 hr window usually) than divide that amount above by 3 and you get .15 btc per month. I have some ideas about how it may be possible to extend the profit margin beyond just the mining revenue.
@_date: 2016-07-11 02:00:38
You're most welcome. I haven't decided to sell the DC power supply yet but have considered what that might look like. Basically I would import the parts and do assembly here trying to create good job opportunities in the process. I would then ship out on a per-order basis and only accept btc as payment.
As far as living here, it's super low cost of living and quality of life is great. I admit it's not for everyone but for some people it's the greatest. I'm one of those who seem to have just been born for here. Absolutely love it.
@_date: 2016-07-10 17:07:52
-Yes, estimated payback 3-4 yrs.
-Same ROI for larger numbers. It's a modular system that you just copy to scale up so costs/roi stay constant although there are some economies of scale that come into play if you have say $10k to invest. That's just on the purchasing power/shipping cost side.
-Check out a post I'll be making a little later for more details about how to do a large scale system. It's about having a core model that gets copied, not having a huge central system.
@_date: 2016-07-13 16:56:38
Ok, after giving this some thought I don't think I'm going to be able to get one to you as quickly as you may want. I had considered building and selling just the dc-dc power supply as we're talking about here but to be honest the plan was for a little down the road. A couple of things have to happen in order for me to build a working model designed to run a s9;
- I have to scale up the model I already have working with 2 s5. This essentially needs to double in amp capacity.
- I have to do extensive testing in service to know that everything is working fine. In order to do this I need an s9. Anything else would not be a conclusive test imho. Given the notorious history of scams in the btc mining hardware game I will never accept money for anything unless I have a fully tested and working model in hand.
Just the shipping times alone for the parts to arrive to me here would be around 2-3 months. I will be happy to sell you one when I know it's working as intended. Also I don't mind scaling that up to a larger order but would never go there again without a tested model. So, I will let you know if/when I ever get there. Still happy to answer questions if you want to try to build it yourself.
@_date: 2016-07-10 18:31:34
I would add a few lessons learned;
- more profitable to mine only during daylight hours
- standard batteries don't cut it. use either graphene capacitors (16v500f-ultra-capacitor) or edison batteries. anything else will not last long due to the aggressive discharge cycle. I got my capacitors from china on aliexpress. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 23:56:18
I'm an IT guy with an interest in solar, not an electrical engineer. I'm sure some of those bright young kids you mentioned would get the concept in a hurry and soon be making improvements. Just keep in mind the specific components I listed have been tested and that I have chosen them based on the best price/value point of diminishing returns. You may be able to find larger capacity relays for example, and thus use less, but the cost per amp capacity are the best on the ones I listed. One of my design goals was to keep it accessible to the home miner so I made sure to use components that were cheap, easy to find and easy to replace.
I'm not on reddit every day but I don't mind helping out as you go along with it. As far as starting small with an experiment you could get the charge controller and just one pack of the relays and figure out how that needs to be hooked together just to be able to get a 12v out that you can turn on and off with the button on the charge controller. I strongly suggest to start with the voltage regulator as well. It's only 20 bucks for one. Figure out the wiring with one relay, the charge controller and one regulator. That should give you the confidence to scale up the amp capacity to miner levels. Maybe use cheap used miners for load testing.
@_date: 2016-07-09 21:55:30
The trick is in getting the exact parts list that works together. In theory it's simple but it seems the risk of having to test/develop a new design has kept people from trying. Except me, I decided to accept the risk and spend my own money to invent something new. As far as I know I'm the only one who has a working design purpose built for solar mining. My motivation is simply that I felt if I could work out something that is more cost effective that it could be my contribution to the community. I have a profitable design (more of a method really) now but trust me I had to spend my coin and time to get there.
