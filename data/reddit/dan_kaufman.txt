How is it misleading?  Sure, in the future, transaction volume could grow by 1,000X to compensate for coinbase awards going the way of the dodo bird. But for right now, the math is the math.
Don't believe Bitcoin mining is becoming centralized? Ever heard of Bitfury and KncMiner?

Look at list of founders, advisors and angel investors at 
Look at their experience and accomplishments. 
All NeuCoins owned by founders, advisors and angels have re-sale restrictions for 5 years.

NeuCoin's fundamental tenet is to distribute the currency to all participants - consumers, merchants, developers, service providers, etc - in proportion to the value and utility created.
Can anyone name a better distribution philosophy if one's purpose is to maximize the value and utility of the currency?

True that NeuCoin’s three transparent non-profit foundations - the Code, Growth and Utility foundations - initially own the majority of coins. The foundations btw are controlled by NeuCoin holders (1 coin = 1 vote).  
Over time, the foundations will be distributing the currency to all participants who increase its value  - consumers, merchants, developers, service providers, etc.
This structure will make NeuCoin more decentralized and accountable in the long run than Bitcoin, Ripple or Stellar, let alone most of the anonymous alt coins out there.

First of all, checkpoints won't be necessary in NeuCoin's design (and we assume that Peercoin will be able to get rid of checkpoints in the future with some design modifications). But honestly this is a typical Bitcoiner argument against proof-of-stake. Rather than pointing out any flaws in NeuCoin's white paper, critics point to *another* implementation and claim that IT is not secure enough, or not decentralized enough. By the way, nobody on the Bitcoin side is even bothering to argue that proof-of-work is efficient or decentralized (unless you want to count "i don't believe it" along with a down-vote).
