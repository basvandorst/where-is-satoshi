I always wondered why countries that use metric use cm for their height. Why not meters? I can't easily visualize 178cm but I can easily visualize 1.78 meters.
That would be like saying I'm 68 inches tall. I can't visualize that, but I can easily visualize feet. 5 feet 8 inches.

Thanksgiving had family members talking about it which started the recent spike. Now hitting $10k is going to cause a *lot* more people to talk about it. And next month is Christmas and New Year's. It's going to go up much much more by January.

Apparently everyone in this thread knows what a log scale chart is. Can someone explain this graph?
