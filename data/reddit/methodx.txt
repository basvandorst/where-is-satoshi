What if you import the paper wallet into blockchain.info? Can you then send coins from it?
@_date: 2014-07-24 15:26:08
Porn sites usually pay a flat annual fee and are charged 10 - 20% off *every* transaction. Sometimes it's 30 or 40% depending on how big your site is. Chargebacks in the adult industry are huge. I've seen sites with 30% chargebacks.
Here's bitcoins advantage:
* Fees are pretty much 0%.
* No possibility of chargebacks (just like cash).
* Discreet. No paper trail for the wife / girlfriend to find.
* Does not easily support affiliate commissions.
* No recurring payments.
Since not many people have bitcoins at the moment (it's still pretty underground), you should create an incentive to do so in the form of a discount. Since you'll be saving a substantial amount on processor fees and future chargebacks, it makes sense to pass most of those saving on to your customers. If you don't, they probably wont bother to pay with bitcoins.
Price to pay with credit card: $29.95
With Bitcoin: $23.96 (20% discount)
This gives them a reason to use it and saves you money.

@_date: 2014-05-18 04:58:31
1. Save bitaddress.org (file &gt; save as).
2. Burn an Ubuntu (Linux) boot CD or use a USB key and put the Bitaddress.org file on the CD or USB key.
3. Physically unplug Internet.
4. Boot into Ubuntu with the live CD.
5. Create a secure wallet.
And if you're super paranoid, go out and buy a brand new PC, put Linux on it and never connect it to the Internet. Personally, I'd say this is very unnecessary.

Why bits? Because people are conditioned since birth to think of prices as whole numbers. There's a reason retailers price their goods and services at $19.99, $24.95, $99, etc. Because the psychology of numbers influences the perceived value of said good. It's perfectly fine to criticize the word "bits", but I fear those critics are missing the point of this debate: we need to price goods as whole numbers, regardless of the naming convention.
@_date: 2014-05-22 13:18:30

Because every time bad news comes out of China it effects the market less and less. There have been a flood of banks announcing that they will cut off any relationship with bitcoin exchanges and they're not even getting noticed by the market anymore.

That's the theory anyway.

I completely agree. We're simply not at the stage of adoption where sponsoring a UFC fight or any sporting event is a smart move. That demographic simply cannot use bitcoin in its current form in any meaningful way. We need to focus on what matters. Look at the crazy amount of PR that came from Dark Wallet / Dark Market. We need more of that. It's free PR and directly funds bitcoin development.

Yes! The traffic increase from such a PR stunt would totally justify the  trouble integrating Bitcoin into existing shopping cart software.

So do away with private keys? What?
@_date: 2014-09-15 23:14:22
I hold both BTC and BTSX. The two are not at odds.
*BitShares X is an experiment to test the economic theory behind a new kind of prediction market. This experiment creates a decentralized bank and exchange that uses a decentralized transaction ledger secured by DPOS to create fungible digital assets that are market-pegged to the value of anything from dollars, to gold, to gallons of gasoline. Like all DACs, BitShares X has shares that can be transferred between users in the same way as Bitcoin. What makes BitShares X special is that it also implements a business model similar to existing banks or brokerages.
BitShares X can create BitUSD by lending it into existence backed by collateral in the same way that the banking system lends dollars into existence today. Whereas your bank uses your house as collateral, BitShares X uses BTSX as collateral. If the value of the collateral falls relative to BitUSD then BitShares X will automatically cover your loan by selling the BTSX held as collateral for BitUSD and giving the borrower the BTSX is left over.
The reason someone borrows BitUSD is for the purpose of executing a short sell of BitUSD relative to BTSX. This works in the same manner as shorting a stock. First, you borrow the stock, then you sell it at todays high prices. If all goes well then you can buy it back tomorrow for less than you paid today, pay off your loan, and keep the profit. However, if things go against you then you will have to pay more to buy back the stock than you sold it for in the first place and thus take a loss.
BitUSD is created when two people taking opposite positions can agree to a price and the only price at which two people will agree is the current market price of USD in BTSX otherwise one individual will start out losing money. The mechanics of the market peg are very similar to the mechanics of a prediction market. Once the market has reached a consensus that BitUSD should be valued the same as a real US Dollar no one will be able to trade against that consensus without losing money. Thus the value of BitUSD today is based upon the prediction of what market participants will value BitUSD at in the future. There is only one rational way to speculate, that the consensus will hold, and that creates a self-enforcing market peg.
With BitShares X all short positions (those borrowing BitUSD) must start out with enough BTSX as collateral to purchase 2x the USD borrowed. Margin calls are executed when the value of the collateral falls to 1.5x the amount borrowed. This gives the market ample opportunity to cover the short position and pay off the loan before there is insufficient collateral. In the event that the market is forced to execute a margin call, a 5% fee will be assessed. This should encourage participants to be pro-active in maintaining sufficient margin.
In the rare event that the value of BTSX falls by more than 50% in less than an hour resulting in insufficient collateral, 100% of the collateral will be used to cover as much BitUSD as possible leaving some BitUSD uncovered. The result of this price movement is that some BitUSD will be in circulation without any backing which may or may not impact the market peg of BitUSD to USD. We have two hypothesis as to the market response in this event: in one case the BitUSD will start trading at a discount proportional to the surplus BitUSD in circulation, in the other case the market expectation of a peg to USD will override any surplus supply and BitUSD will continue trading as before. This would be similar to how the dollar did not see an immediate fall to 0 value despite being removed from the gold standard.*

Would you consider it a hindrance because one individual would own such a large percentage of coins and that makes powerful people nervous? I think Satoshi, whoever he is, is the type of person to do a lot of good with that wealth. It's been over 5 years and those coins haven't moved. Whoever controls them is clearly not motivated by greed and has very good control over their impulses. I don't see the "satoshi coins" being a problem at all, in fact I see it as a well deserved reward and look forward to the worlds first trillionaire.

Yes but what the 1MB transaction limit means is there can only be roughly 7 transaction per second (maybe a bit more). Will 7 transactions per second be enough to sustain a secure blockchain? Those 7 transactions would be *unbelievably* expensive, defeating any benefit bitcoin once offered. Transactions would have to move off chain and once that happens you end up with a system similar to what we already have.

Yes, you're referring to solutions such as Coinapults "Locks". This is basically e-Gold, a *centralized* solution subject to local regulations. For example, Coinapult won't offer Locks to the U.S. currently because of legal concerns. You also can't directly transact with the pegged asset like you can with (for example) BitUSD. The user would have to manually use a pegging service. I also can't see there ever being any yield offered. An e-Gold type pegging service will be expensive to run, considering they're actually buying the physical asset with the BTC. I remain unconvinced.

Yes I agree with you in terms of moores law. Storage will increase while simultaneously becoming cheaper.
What I'm asking is *if* the 1MB transaction limit cannot be raised, where will mining incentive come from in our hypothetical future? If the limit *can* be increased, we're fine. If it *cannot* be increased, we're not fine (due to there being no financial incentive in the form of transactions). 
I believe that once the incentive is there to raise the limit, the required hard fork will be done with ease. BUT I'm still curious to know what would happen in a hypothetical scenario where the 1MB limit cannot be raised.
Btw, thank you for taking the time to answer my questions.

Bitcoin will first be used as a "store of value" and hedge against fiat currency for the next 3 years. It won't have many practical uses for the average consumer over this time span. Entrepreneurs will continue to innovate and make wallets easier to use, transactions more secure, etc. Companies will slowly begin integrating bitcoin into their existing payment processors improving its practical use gradually. At around the 2 - 3 year mark we'll reach a tipping point when the user experience is great AND bitcoin can be spent in mainstream stores. Mass adoption from grandma and grandpa will come during the next financial crisis, when their kids start setting up wallets for them, kind of like how we used to install Firefox and ad block on their computers.

The part that I'm confused about (and I'm assuming others are) is how will I access the marketplace. I completely understand the decentralized part but how to access the marketplace is not explained well. I'm hearing a lot about nodes and access points and such. How will I tell my friends how to use this? "Billy, go to ______ and check out OpenBazzar!" Will it be an app like Kazza (anyone remember this!) that connects to a gnutella type network? So the user would go to OpenBazaar.org and download the client? How to access the marketplace needs to be clearly explained in non-technical terms. Nobody cares about nodes and such. Just tell them how to ACCESS it. And make sure it's extremely easy.

"BI: Switching gears a bit: 2012 was not the best year for you, if I recall a blog post I read.
FW: Yeah, 2012 was a bad year for me because I had too much on my plate. A lot of it was dealing with companies that weren’t going to succeed and I knew they weren’t going to succeed, yet I had to spend a lot of time on them. It got in the way of being able to make new investments.
I also wasn’t particularly inspired by the things I was seeing. I talked a little bit about been-there-done-that. The whole world of social wasn’t particularly interesting to me. It was a combination of all of that, really. 2013 was better. I made two investments and found this other one, which we’re going to close in another week or two. We were much more productive in terms of new investments.
With Bitcoin and the blockchain, I found something that got me excited again."

You're forgetting that paying with bitcoin is *more secure* then a credit card. If you pay for something at Target or some shady website and your card details (cc number, address, CVS) get stolen, the cc company foots the bill. When you pay for something with bitcoin, nobody sees or stores your private key (because cryptography). Since everyone seems to throw around their cc number like it's nothing, fraud is *huge*. Bitcoin doesn't require you to throw anything around so fraud will be *way less*. Therefore, insuring bitcoin will be much cheaper. Think about it.
