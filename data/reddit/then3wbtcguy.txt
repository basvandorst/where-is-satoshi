Yea, I just realized this as well.. They must be meaning that the hot/cold wallets are now using multi Sig.
That's good.
But as a previous poster said, who/what confirms the second sig needs to be "not,automated/written by idiots" or it defeats the purpose.

I still want to believe in the utopia of change allowed by blockchain tech.
But more and more, I believe it will be (has been) subjugated by the "powers that be" into the "inevitable" worst nightmare.
Further controlling people in a billion mathematicaly provable ways they never could before, and we have yet to devise for ourselves.
However, this growing concern hasn't yet changed my personal investment strategies.
I guess i want to profit off the future enslavement of a thousand generations?
Maybe I'm just addicted to crypto shit..

I have TONS of questions/opinions, and theorys. But Here's one question I find myself wondering..
Does any part of you wonder if/feel that IF you HAD taken the CEO job, you might have helped Mark?..
What I mean is: You suspected it was messed up, and he was keeping it walled up for some reason... What if you had been willing to step INTO the fire WITH him, you then might have been able to pull him(and bitcoin) out?

Dude you answered your own question!
Bitcoin is a new "net" that not only allows storing/accessing worldwide info, but storing and accessing a worldwide asset ledger(explain about trust vrs trustless)....and your done!
Internet 2.0 
simple. 
Get on board bitch!

Yes that is weird! I am interested in reading more from the blockchain sleuths! And any media concerning actual price paid. Keep it up!

Use a non persistent version of TAILS to boot into and download green address web site. Save it to brand new USB. Reboot (don't turn on internet) use the one on the USB to create address, use phone to send coins and set up watch wallet with mycelium on phone..( Maybe even set up some other ones using mycelium for small amounts (it's very easy and secure)
Encrypt and Save the PDF on the USB and you can even encrypt the USB! Make copies of USB and encrypt. Or print out the paper wallet PDF and store (printers potentially store images, so again use TAILS or other Linux live CDs) 
That should do it.😩
When you want to spend it, load up the TAILS, put in the USB and load the address into mycelium, and spend it, send any left over to a NEW COLD address made with the above process. With watch wallet on mycelium.☺
