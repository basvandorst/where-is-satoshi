That too, the thought that someone can just walk off with your money far easier that they could with other types of investments is terrifying.

I think the biggest hold up in mainstream acceptance in cryptocurrency is the volatility. At least in my opinion it moves to wildly for me to take a serious look at putting money into it. I follow crypto casually as I have like $12 USD in BTC when I was learning a little about the mining scene a year or so ago. For people like me who are not crypto fanatics or experts in the field it just doesn’t seem wise to invest my money in something that can go up and down thousands of dollars in minutes. Most people can’t afford our investments to jump so wildly or have the time to watch the market 24/7 too yank out our money if it starts to slide to far down. The whole hold for ever advice is great for most investments outside crypto, but crypto can be influenced by single people and that makes it far more risk then banks and investment firms wielding the same power as they can only go so far within current regulations, no financial institution would get away with dropping any blue chip stock 30% or more of its value without some type of investigation and most likely consequences for doing so. What normal people what is assurance that they won’t lose their life savings overnight and crypto can’t offer that right now at least to those people not already into crypto. If crypto is going mainstream people have to feel their money is mostly safe invested in it and right now that is not the case for many people I’ve had conversations with about cryptocurrencies.
