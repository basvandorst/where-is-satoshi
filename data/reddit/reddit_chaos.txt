Thank you - I resubmitted this article because not enough debate or viewpoints were presented in the earlier submission.
And, certainly not citable stuff. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 09:09:31
So basically, he was telling you to go DogeCoin instead of Bitcoin
edit: well it seems that I was misinformed and 'to the moon' is not a dogecoin meme. oh well - in that case, I stand corrected. But then, what is one to think if they come to cryptocurrency in today's environment - its doge coin which is always talking about going to the moon.
@_date: 2014-02-23 15:23:37
Thanks for the update. I likely won't be testing out the free trial either. 
However, I am definitely interested in a promo code (there seems to be a text box for that in the registration) which can bring down the pricing for the full version.
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:47:00
I am not sure I understand how his identity will be revealed if he sells his coins. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:33:18
Agreed. But I am guessing that the price of any items in the game is going to be in Satoshis and not mBTC and uBTC - in any case, I will be thinking about giving the game a try.
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:18:46
what? he is dead?
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:21:20
See? They all look so wrong.
@_date: 2014-01-26 13:12:47
what are your views on dogecoins?
@_date: 2014-02-23 16:50:26
Oh ok. thanks. I thought that the promo code could get me some level of discounts on the pricing :)
@_date: 2016-11-26 13:39:13
I have been surprised how this hasn't impacted the price of bitcoin much. Shows how little adoption we have in India. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 18:13:51
I agree with your statement on the part about more government control and tracking of money. I don't like it either. On the other hand there is rampant corruption in the country which cash supports. Reduction of use cases where you need cash reduces the value of cash. When I travel to the US and use a hundred dollar bill at a store, I have received looks which tell me it is it usual. Here in India people will buy a car in all cash and no one will bat an eye. 
So there are pros and cons to this. My personal thought though is that the government didn't need a 2000 rupee note. It makes it easier to be corrupt now since you can pack more money in less space now. Those in India who can spend a 2000 rupee note in one go can actually afford to use a credit card or any number of wallets available. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 03:16:03
Not sure if by this reply I am feeding a troll, but here goes anyway. Two points regarding your comment. 
First, the highest banknote right now is actually 2000. Not 100. So more like 30 dollars. 
Second, 100 rupees goes much further in India then $1.15 in the US. 
Having said that, I don't feel personally that we should have launched a 2000 rupee note but that is another story altogether. 
If you'd like to have a discussion to understand more what's happening here, I am happy to answer questions. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 18:21:01
User Ronan already answered in wonderful detail some of what's happening. The reason you haven't heard much is because this happened mere days before Trump was elected and so. 
Personally, we haven't been affected. I am middle class, have a job, a bank account, and live in a city. I can mostly survive without ANY cash. 
A lot of people will be inconvenienced by this - even if they are completely honest and tax compliant. 
However, my heart goes out to those few hundred million who are just above the poverty line, and can hardly afford disruptions like these to their lives. Since they are so busy staying above the poverty line. No one has an idea how many such are going to be irreversibly affected by this. 
In addition, there are a large number of small businesses who have valid use cases where cash is the primary and sometimes only means of transaction. These have been harmed quite a lot. 
So, this move is like chemotherapy for cancer. While it is hopefully going to root out corruption and other things it is targeting; it is likely to harm a lot of other healthier parts of the country. 
On the other hand, the cliche goes: what doesn't kill us makes us stronger. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:13:29
I always thought that you get to keep it when found in purchased stuff like that. On the other hand, feel free to send some to me.
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:20:19
I also would like a simple, no pain way to buy from my country (India) - it is still too tough to buy bitcoin, IMO.
@_date: 2013-03-06 17:34:41
Sorry friend, I didn't even try to record the ones I tried. It wasn't a planned hack attack of any kind.
I don't even know how to attack his wallet specifically - i just went and tried to import random brain wallets into a wallet i made at blockchain.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:07:28
well, i will be looking for 'good reasons' then to allow you to tip me.
@_date: 2013-05-13 05:16:00
Thanks. This game, Dune 2, and a game called Privateer - is what I grew up on when I first got onto PC gaming.
@_date: 2013-03-06 17:36:03
GSA, thanks man - but really, I wish I could do all that as it would be a nice challenge. But, really, got no time.
I just wish someone in the BitCoin world would just gift me a few bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:44:18
Damn it - I don't have enough BitCoins for even a 0.05 bet.
Can you guys not let us play lower (like in the mBTC or uBTC domain?)
@_date: 2013-02-22 18:36:28
well yes. but that is what i meant by 'other than individual adoption and evangelism'.
Can we create some kind of movement. Maybe an indigogo style campaign for raising let's say 1000 BTC for some cause or something. And a million other such activities.
It seems to me that there needs to be an organization dedicated to promoting the use of BTC for legal and mainstream activities - as well as cleaning up the image in public.
Today, when a regular, non-technical, person looks for Bitcoin, they are likely to get scared off it because of the FUD surrounding it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:09:49
@_date: 2013-03-06 01:33:12
I am open for suggestions. I am very new at this, and trying to improve my total wealth of 70 mBTC.
@_date: 2013-06-06 09:23:27
Thanks for that comment. Another thing that happens with online casinos today is that there are companies that develop the casino platforms but don't operate them - they develop the games, the server logic, provide the hosting, the financial transactions, the regulatory compliance, and so on.
Someone looking to open a casino can simply rent this infrastructure from this company, put a skin on it, customize it a bit for their setup, and run it. 
This makes the whole thing safer since the actual gaming logic is not with the casino itself - and since the company providing the services doesn't have an incentive to cheat (since they are not earning from the players' bets), there will likely be no cheating.
Maybe some of these companies need to support bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:57:39
it is a function of time. And the IP was blocked temporarily. They automatically lifted the ban. And later on I added many more wallets but slower, and it worked fine.
@_date: 2013-03-06 22:51:25
Damn it. 35 BTC. Here I am, not even being able to buy 1. Have tried multiple options, and yet no BitCoins in my pocket.
I might as well put up a begging sign.
@_date: 2013-03-17 13:08:22
That worked. Thank you. But I do have a follow up question. In the QT client, I have been creating a new address for every different source that I could receive BTC from.
And when I do the dumpprivkey command for each one, the private key is different. 
So then, it is not really a matter of knowing your private key; instead it is a matter of knowing your private keyS. Right?
@_date: 2013-03-06 01:35:07
I see. Man, bitcoin is one difficult coin to acquire. I wish I had made it to that charity drive today in time.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:52:26
I simply backup my QT wallet to dropbox... so computer crash is not a problem - am I doing something wrong or insecure?
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:24:27
You should party by tipping everyone on this thread 1 BTC
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:17:01
i guess you are right. Well, I am trying to buy fractions, so I guess I am on the right path.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:12:09
i do have one concern. how will buying using bitcoin prevent me from being the victim of bad vendors.
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:24:47
It's times like this I wish I could just call up the person I am replying to (makes things faster).
If you have your data from your old install. And let's say it was out of synch since yesterday, then just pointing your new install to that data using the method i described will leave your install out of synch by only a day. Instead of 300 that you are seeing now.
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:31:54
same here. I actually got quite a few wallet hits - but all had zeroed out their balances already :)
@_date: 2013-02-22 08:56:50
Came here to say this as well. The bitcointip thing by nerdfightersean is potentially disruptive. Either work with him to take it to a whole new level or build something similar which takes it outside the scope of reddit.
BTW, you should see that the magic with bitcointip is the simplicity of transactions. If that magic can be replicated at a larger scale then we have something interesting.
Build a platform which can be used anywhere at any scale.
@_date: 2013-03-17 16:38:49
i have read this. I will try to come back and reply in more detail. right now in a hurry.
@_date: 2013-03-17 06:53:55
that's what i get too
@_date: 2013-11-16 14:22:55
alright - searching what bitcoind means... thanks for getting me pointed in the right direction - now just hoping all this can run on a Windows 8 machine
@_date: 2013-05-06 07:57:01
So one day, these two will be millions, right? I should start planning for the heist already.
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:25:49
BTW, I am considering hosting my wallet elsewhere which doesn't require me to download the whole blockchain (that data is over 15 Gigs already - and as Bitcoin becomes popular with more and more transactions, I am guessing that it will quickly become impractical to host it).
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:04:33
That's true - but then the people with wholes are going to be orders of magnitude richer than people who are working on uBTC level.
@_date: 2013-02-22 16:01:08
Somehow the notion that bitcoin is only good for drugs and other illegal stuff needs to be changed.
Reddit community should organize some sustained PR around it. And we should all participate.
@_date: 2013-09-03 03:19:54
went to sign up - price was too high - got back... sorry and good luck
@_date: 2013-03-06 00:36:44
just checked it out - also noted that it has a 10% premium on market price.
@_date: 2013-09-28 18:21:57
i thought referral links were not allowed.
@_date: 2013-03-06 04:17:54
Great. Looking forward to it. Anyway, with the way the price for BTC is moving, even mini and micro will become quite dear anyway.
@_date: 2013-02-21 16:15:06
Well, if the purpose is to expose people to Bitcoin, then you could give a tip right here.
But, pathetic jokes aside, that is an excellent point you make. is the best place for the kind of exposure Bitcoin needs.
@_date: 2013-02-22 17:21:22
what can we do? I am willing to help out - I mean other than each individual adopting and spreading the word - what can we do together?
We really should do something about it.
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:26:05
So, second part of Step 4 - the EuroCoin scenario - how will that be different from any currency today? Can you elaborate that a bit more whenever you get the chance.
Thanks again.
@_date: 2013-09-03 03:06:12
I am as much about Bitcoin as the next guy - but are you kidding me... 


come back and talk to me when a country the size of India starts buying all of their oil in Bitcoins from other countries
@_date: 2013-02-21 16:12:34
If you want a tester who will work for Bitcoins remotely from home, then I am your guy.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:12:31
I don't understand this - why will it be more expensive in China
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:06:49
Don't worry about sounding dumb - i think this is new for most of us (including me). 
Your interpretation is right. If you have never run QT (or haven't in a long time) then doesn't matter what you do, you have to wait for it to synch up (and yes it takes hours for the first time). The key is to keep it running 24x7 so that it is always up to synch.
My assumption was that you are reinstalling (either as a result of moving a computer - as I did, or perhaps restoring from backup or something).
If you don't want to wait that long then your best bet is to use a wallet which doesn't require the entire blockchain to be downloaded - as others suggested (Electum seems to be good)... 
Or, some of the online wallets might work as well. I have used blockchain.info for this purpose (when I purchased a BTC recently). When it was sold to me, I was able to import the private key into a wallet I made on that site.
Anyway, my offer to receive the payment on your behalf and hold it till you figure it out is still open :D - I may or may not keep a little for providing that particular service though.
@_date: 2013-03-06 01:33:55
thanks. I did look at it, but most offers in my geography (delhi, India) look very questionable.
@_date: 2013-03-26 05:21:57
Here I thought this would be an appeal to Bitcoin veterans to share their bitcoins.... but this is good too
@_date: 2013-05-01 17:29:57
Yup - that is where I have my wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-16 14:13:01
How do I run a bitnode? I would like to. And also, does it benefit just the network or do I benefit from it too (I will run it regardless).
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:16:16
Oh - I have been running bitcoin-qt for months... already running a full node then... thanks for clarifying that....
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:35:12
Yes, in theory.
I haven't practiced it myself yet.
@_date: 2013-02-22 18:40:15
keyword: hypothetical
edit: spelling
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:21:21
well that is what you can call as a half-hearted comment on my part.
@_date: 2013-03-17 15:14:07
Ya know, BTC (mBTC, uBTC, Satoshis) sounds so much like the futuristic currencies that are used in almost all science fiction movies placed in the future.
You are always dealing in 'credits' - and there is no talk of exchange rates, and they are usually carried on person (attached to the person - not through multiple bank accounts, and so on), are universal, and are exchanged peer to peer.
@_date: 2013-05-12 09:03:30
so how can i play this game again?
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:17:59
i like this idea better as well...
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:40:13
At least, that made them over a bitcoin richer - those who fell for it, poor them.
Now those scammers have more money in Bitcoins then I have.
@_date: 2013-06-28 11:59:03
this makes me think - there is whole lot of lost bitcoins out there. does that have any effect on the ecosystem?
@_date: 2013-03-06 14:37:40
Thanks linjaaho. But I only had like an hour to spend on this - and that is already gone.
Good luck to whoever gets your wallets - in case they don't. Feel free to send me the coin from one of them :D
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:52:32
I simply backup my QT wallet to dropbox... so computer crash is not a problem - am I doing something wrong or insecure?
Edit: of course, I am not as worried about it as you are because it has practically nothing in it.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:09:42
Can anything be done?
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:38:50
being an indian, i can tell you that the cost of living in majority of India is very low. it is rising to ridiculous levels in some parts of the country though (such as where I live).
@_date: 2013-03-17 15:09:32
No no. My bad for stupidly commenting.
I was trying to explore more on how such a system would work on reddit. If we are applying a reward to the "deserving" getting an upvote - should we also put a penalty, when the same person gets a downvote?
And what does that mean for the person who is upvoting (losing some money from their account)? And the one downvoting - who is not losing anything.
Any better, this time?
@_date: 2013-12-15 03:53:29
Yes - but I tend to think that for me it is the first filter based on which i reject phishing emails - could there be a band of users which will start falling for this if they had perfectly worded mails?
@_date: 2013-03-07 23:04:57
good reply.
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:50:05
i guess i am not getting rich today. but if i had the password, i would think more than once whether i should just take the money.
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:40:19
you can give them my address and I can transfer it to your restored wallet if you are unsure. :)
On a more serious note, as everyone noted, yes it is possible. However, here is another tip - reinstalling the client may again put you in this long loop to sync the blockchain. What I did when I reinstalled QT is copy over the files from my old client and point the QT client to startup in a way that it pointed to where my old data files were. This saved me a ton of time.
I did this by creating a shortcut for the client on my desktop and providing it the path using the datadir variable... Like so:
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe" -datadir=d:\data\bitcoin
The path d:\data\bitcoin contains the database *all the blocks/chainstate/database/blk***.dat files.
@_date: 2013-06-06 08:15:21
It looks like there needs to be a middle man (I know how that sounds) which escrows the information from both the client and the server - so that the server is presented from cheating.
This means that the final calculation takes place elsewhere other than the casino's server - where this elsewhere is owned by a thirdparty.
Again, I may not know what I am talking about.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:34:19
Nah - just being half hopeful that somehow I can make some bitcoins - since I can't afford them otherwise :)
But if flirting will get me there, I don't mind.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:30:43
guess that is what I am looking for. but in India.
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:23:56
same here - i bought from them. the CEO is a good helpful guy - just call them.
@_date: 2013-03-14 17:09:43
This is what I like about BitCoin - so many of the people dealing in BitCoin are on Reddit. Or otherwise active in the community. This is what you need to solve problems quickly.
@_date: 2013-03-17 13:39:07
And that is what I do. I have my wallet password protected, and I create a backup using the client and place it in my dropbox which replicates it to all my computers and my mobile devices.
@_date: 2013-03-06 22:57:08
Finally got through. I am buying from btcQuick.com - and Jared (the owner) is really helpful. Like really helpful.
So, go over there while stocks last.
@_date: 2013-03-17 13:43:06
So, if I upvote, I spend some BTC. With the intent of spending that BTC. So, does the OP get all the BTC worth the upvotes?
What about when I downvote? Do I get some BTC back (ridiculous question, I know)? What about the BTC that the OP gets, does it get affected somehow?
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:24:03
relative to my buying power :)
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:07:57
yes, i am trying to buy that - however, that doesn't change the fact that Bitcoin is really expensive right now.
@_date: 2013-03-13 03:47:15
How is that different from Alice claiming that she sent you 10 grand? She can show her transaction log on Twitter to claim that.
@_date: 2013-03-06 13:51:32
i finally had my IP blocked for testing too many passwords trying to import brainwallets :)
Edit: on blockchain.info
And I could almost taste that 1 BTC :(
@_date: 2013-09-01 16:54:44
And that's what i get for not reading the rules properly.
@_date: 2013-03-06 04:16:50
i think i am gonna buy using btcquick or something. Even though the price is insane right now.
