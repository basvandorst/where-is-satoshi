How much did you spend when you bought Bitcoin? I bet it was more than all Paypals and visas combined.

All you said might be true for the mechanics of how bitcoin works. 
When we talk about the price - no one knows and all that talk, news, twitter - they all come to a simple answer “It might go up. Or - go down”.

Yeah, I guess you’re right.

So, you will continue to pay double tax: when buying Btc on Coinbase and when selling it. Then whats the point of mass adoption? And how do you know that Coinbase is any better than Fed?

Can’t trust NYT, I agree. 
But its more reliable than any coindesk or whatever those website names are.

Yeeah? And what about us? Why should we pay Coinbase a hectic fee to buy a cup of coffee? I like the way you transfer these fees on consumers, but please - don’t make it a great deal. Its a robbery.

You recognize BS when you see the magic words “Gold Standard”.  Dont bother reading any further.

Can somebody explain why bitcoin would be more than just hype trading asset? Its not useful for storage f value or medium of exchange due to price fluctuations. You have to pay hefty fees to acquire it. Fees to get your $ back. Whats the point? What is it for, really? My answer is - nothing. Sorry, dear HODLers.

That’s a problem too. There’re no people with reputation in Finance/Economics who would support bitcoin. All you have to read is shitty websites like Coindesk, CCN, Etc. 
Name a few guys who give you “perspectives”, please.  
Two cents about adoption: Why would I adopt a currency when I have to pay a hectic fee twice? One time when I buy it, second time when I sell it. It makes no sense to me.
