Sovereign debt is nothing like personal debt. It would be great news for bitcoin if the US actually tried to pay off it's debt because then there would be less places to simply store value in an inflation protected way.

I care about bitcoin as a technology so I was focusing on how it works as a protocol. The protocol centralizes all trust and transactions into the blockchain, the power is supposed to be decentralized, but the trust is implicity centralized into the block chain, which in turn is distributed to all nodes that want to hear it.
I completely agree that the power is decentralized, the problem here is that there are so many parts of bitcoin that are decentralized, but as long as not all of them are then it isn't a fully decentralized piece of techonology.

I fucking love bitcoin and its an amazing piece of technology, arugably one of the most important things to come out of the internet stand right next to wikipedia and pervasive communication. However it is not a decentralized technology, it is a redundant, distributed, yet centralized technology. Everything goes through the blockchain, there is only one true blockchain. A network partition would ruin the concept.

Bitcoin in it's current state will be awful for things the size of galaxies. You would have an insane amount of orphaned blocks and the amount of time you would need to wait for a good confirmation would be prohibitive for most stuff.

@_date: 2014-07-05 23:42:13
By it's nature bitcoin is very vurnerable to a network partition, under a network partition you should not accept any new blocks unless you are SURE that those blocks are going to be in the longest chain. The situtation where a double spend could occur due to a network partition would be very unlikely (it would requrie someone on both sides of the partition) but all minted coins on one side would eventually be invalidated. Transactions that are attempted could be stored and replayed when the partition is gone, but relying on that would open yourself up for a double spend.
By putting all the trust in the block chain there is no way to deal with a network partition. If you are really interested in how you could make a crypto currency that could function during a network partition I could write something up, but the simplest solution is to make sure that a network partition never happens. Governments that are okay with implementing massive firewalls could attempt a network partition attack to ensure that their citizens don't see bitcoin as a viable option, and in situatuions like syria bitcoin would have been useless after the internet went out.
Anyways this subreddit is not very good for discussing the actual techinical limitations of bitcoin because of all of the blind zealotry here.

However Liberia has far over taken the country of origin: Guinea. What is really important here is not the number of cases but the ability of the government to react. Nigieria is the largest economy in Africa while the other affected countries have recently gone through brutal civil war. It is entirely possible that Nigira will be able to handle is outbreak but will continously have cases from their very pourous borders.
TL;DR The Nigierian government is much better equiped to deal with the outbreak that any of the other three affected countries.
@_date: 2014-06-12 00:24:02
This is **actually** good news.
@_date: 2014-07-05 23:19:10
The chance that the blockchain is lost is pretty much 0 at this point, however a network partition or a hard fork are still very real possibilities. In fact a hard fork has happened in the fairly recent past. Because the validity of transactions relys completely on the blockchain the trust is entirely centralized to that single point of failure. A network partition means that unless you happen to be connected to a simple majority of the hash rate you can't trust any transactions until the partition is gone.
@_date: 2014-09-01 15:54:02

Not instant. There is no guarantee on how quickly the transaction will propagate. I love bitcoin, but don't misrepresent it.
@_date: 2014-07-06 14:33:35
Yes this is all true. In actuality it is not the biggest threat to the system, the raw throughput/latency is much worst, but I felt like mentioning it because I don't feel like bitcoin is a truely decentralized system. There is a lot of thought that goes into how distributed systems work (see CAP theorm, raft concensus, gossip protocol etc) and to say that bitcoin solves all the problems like frequently does is just incorrect.
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:30:30
It is distributed to every node. It is the central pillar on which the bitcoin protocol works. The work that is done to build this central pillar is distributed amongst all workers, but the list of all valid transactions that can be trusted is not decentralized in any way.
Decentralized and distributed are two very different things. A truely decentralized platform would be somewhat able to function in a network partition, bitcoin can not.
@_date: 2014-07-04 23:48:05

Do you have a source for that? As in santoshi saying that is why he created bitcoin?
You can use bitcoin for whatever you want to use it for, but as long as you want to use it to buy and sell goods and services that the IRS (or the equivilant for your country) links to you taxes are part of the game. You don't want to get caught up in tax evasion, they don't give a shit if you think that 'cryptoanarchy' is the future or that you don't agree with them.
TL;DR Bitcoin doesn't move you above the law. If you want to do something illegal it might help though.
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:42:03
There is a serious problem with throughput, not to mention latency. The throughput is limited to 1MB/minute and the latency is, in expectation, 10 minutes.
That is fucking awful.
@_date: 2014-07-06 14:30:45
I agree that it would most likely still be possible to connect to the greater blockchain in a firewall situation, however people have a hard enough time understanding bitcoin right now without having ot worry about all of the technicallities. Also people will advocate for using bitcoin in countries that don't have a stable currency, plenty of third world countries have intermediate internet access at best, for instance much of the internet in Liberia's capitol is ran by gas generators that go out every day or two. It would be pretty awful to just sit around and wait for the internet to come back up to pay for goods and services.
Also your note about how there are lots of blind downvoting, I don't think your previous false-dichotomy comment "You're right. Trash this whole Bitcoin thing, lets go back to the drawing board." Is not really helping the bitcoin-is-god-there-are-no-faults attitude this community has.
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:31:36
Bitcoin is distributed because the blockchain is distributed to all nodes freely. The block chain in the sole authority on what the current state of the system is. Just because the block chain doesn't exist in just one location doesn't mean that it is decentralized.

I don't know how bitpay does it, but be sure to have the number of confirmations set low as long as the amount you are dealing with is less than thousands of dollars at a time. You want the confirmations to really be at zero when people are making transactions the size of a couple of drinks, that way the transaction goes through faster. There is a tiny amount of risk that that transaction won't go through if that person is very crafty and has a ton of computers working for him. 
Unfortunately I can't find a good link for this at the moment, but basically at a resturant/bar you always want to go with 0 confirmations.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:25:31
First of all, it's not my logic, I was trying to explain the economic concept of **intrinsic value** which is different from **value**, second of all I don't think that what Peter Schiff holds much weight.

But you don't just have to beat the last recorded blocks, but everyone will be mining off of the most recent one, so it will basically be you have to beat the network on N+1 blocks, where N is the number of how far back you want to go. And that is just to put it equal length, which ever block came first will probably have the largest amount of computation power on it, so it is possible for that block to become the final 'truth', but to be sure you should have to beat the network one more time, putting your chain longer, so N+2 to be sure.
Lets assume that no mining pool could pull this off as this behavior would be pretty bad for the bitcoin community and the miners helping would leave. That leaves 17% of unafiliated hashing power. Lets assume that they are all working together. That means for them to work on a block 1 level down then would have a chance of 0.17 * 0.17 * 0.17 of securely obtaining the longest chain. This is a chance of 0.004913, and alternatively they could get an expected yield of E * (0.17 + 0.17 + 0.17) where E is the expected amount of bitcoins in a given block.
Therefore assuming you have 0.17 amount of the computation power to attempt to reach back 1 block it needs to be 100 times more valuable that the expected(average) block reward. ^[1]( For comparison BTCGuild with 0.26% of the hashing power only needs to for the block to be ~45 times higher than the expectation for it to be rational to mine on old blocks.
The general equation should be
P^(B+2) * (V + (B+1) * E) &lt; E * (P * (B+2))
Where P is the probability of beating the network, B is the number of blocks back, V is the value of the block in question, and E is the expected value of each block.
Whenever this ineqaulity holds true it is rational to attempt to mine on the 'old' blocks.
Now, who wants to start figuring out how many times this has happened for a couple of different amounts of mining power?
Also if there are any errors please let me know.
@_date: 2013-05-18 01:49:08

Gold can be made into physical items. There are some electronic pieces that use gold and all high priced jewelry uses gold.
Nothing could possibily use bitcoins quite like that.
However you can't really use USD like that, the bit about using USD to pay taxes is a pretty fucking lame one after having your argument hinge on 'intrinsic value'.
Really what matters is value and 'intrinsic value' is kind of like an absolute floor of what that value could be.
@_date: 2013-05-16 03:52:24

I tried to explain my reasoning behind this in the first paragraph, basically I was going for a fairly conservative estimate with the exception of the 17% figure. Still even with the pretty conservative estimate it only needs 100 times the expected amount, kinda scary.
I have long wanted to caculate the amount of money it would take to take faith away from bitcoin. Publishing how an attack like this would work, and then baiting someone with even more power to make it happen may be the lowest cost I have thought of. Maybe I should write a few blog posts.

You can mine for a pool and just not submit a winning find to the pool.
The difficulty is calculated Every 2016 blocks.
Currently that is ~every 14 days.
Lets say that they brought in about 20% of the current hashrate. They turn that on and blocks are found in 0.83 times the time. If this happens then the difficulty is increased to make it so blocks should be found in 10 minute intervals. But then if they remove their 20% blocks will be found in 12 minute intervals instead. This means that the next difficulty will be computed in 16.8 days instead. Then they can repeat the cycle.
This is all assuming that the same hashrate keeps up. But even an attempt to destablize the system like this may well scare people, if there is ever a large drop off in the hashrate then the time it takes to readjust the difficulty increases as well.
Not positive if all of my math is right, but all in all it's not quite as scary as it could be.
