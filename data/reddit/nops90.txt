Somehow, using an escrow account is considered P2P?

You're very angry. Please cite your sources, and calm down.

Up-vote if you like this idea! We need r/bitcoin's support. We'll be hosting a closed beta &amp; bug bounty soon. Hack the software, keep the coins :)

Technically, that's not completely true. If 51% of the BTC mining power decided to increase the cap, they could. Bitcoin is completely dependent on consensus. And if the consensus decides to increase the cap, then it is technically possible. Fortunately BTC is distributed enough, that it's doubtful you could get 51% of anyone to agree on anything.

It's not that they don't understand the two terms. It's that an overloading of the term "crypto" leads to ambiguity

Thanks! I'm putting a lot of time into getting it right

I know "crypto" is an easy shorthand - but for those who work in cryptography, it's confusing and isn't an accurate representation of the technologies.

The phishing attack could have dropped malware on an administrator computer. That malware can then intercept any 2FA codes put into that computer. The malware can also bypass IP validation, because the computer it's infected may already be on an IP whitelist. And if you compromise a developer machine, then all bets are off. There may be nothing stopping the attacker from disabling withdrawal notifications, or read the 2FA seeds themselves. Their version of events is technically possible
