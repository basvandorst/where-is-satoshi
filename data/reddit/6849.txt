Funny. Last week I asked Square support when they would open in New York and they said they don't know.

No one is arguing about "not your keys not your coins." No one has claimed otherwise.

Apples and oranges. Those are trade secrets. The fact that Square was going to open up in the remaining 3 states was no secret. The question was when. A week before they could have announced to generate buzz, just like Apple "leaks" generate buzz. Think Apple, Samsung, xyz "leaks" are accidents?
My point is that they missed a marketing opportunity.

I hate how being a resident of Georgia excludes me from the fun.

I wouldn't wish that on anyone. One of the reasons Bitcoin hasn't taken off yet is because of trust issues. Hacks only make trust harder to achieve.

Sell when prices go up, and buy when prices go down. Usually works.. unless you kept buying from $20K all the way down to $6K.

Outside of OTC, those trying to sell have an easier time doing so than those trying to buy the same quantity.
On Gemini I am limited to buying $500 per day, but I can withdraw $100K a day.  ???
On GDAX I can buy $7,500 per week. I can withdraw $10K per day. ???
I never understood the logic.

But... do they keep customer records? Something something OPSEC.........

That would encompass most of the world then. Don't you feel special.

I don't understand why anyone wants or needs an ETF. Just buy some on an exchange and learn how to securely store them. If you can't, then hire a company that can do it for you.
Or, maybe the only reason anyone wants an ETF is to spark a new bullrun to profit off of.

Some companies will announce support for something days or weeks in advance to drum up excitement. It's not entitlement.

Glad there are others out there spending Bitcoin. I got mine years ago... hit my moon.. and enjoying life.

I see. Then I find that adoption is going to be a lot more difficult for the average business, especially a US-based one that has to report income and expenses in terms of US dollars.

Not every site/company is willing to accept the risks involved with P2P currencies. If they are willing to accept a 3rd party processor to accept P2P currencies than it's much better than than not accepting any at all.

Simple.com and Capital One haven't been unfriendly to me. I use those two for buying/selling crypto only. I have another account I use for daily living only.


In the US it doesn't matter. CBP can inspect everything. However, keep it in your carryon since you don't know what's going on when TSA and baggage handlers are touching your bags.


Oh my god please no. Get a good password manager and learn how to use it. Done properly, you can memorize one password and have unique credentials for every site. With what you're doing now you're just begging to get your funds stolen from you.

Some people could lose a lot more by not using a bank at all.

Does it convert to fiat?
@_date: 2019-09-14 13:52:07


Yes, that is how business accounting works. But when they have BTC they still need fiat to pay taxes, vendors, etc. Can't pay the lease with BTC either.


The capital loss is the thing the business wants to avoid. With Fiat the only "loss" is inflation. But that isn't much of a concern since money comes and goes all the time.
Don't get me wrong. I'd like a business to accept Bitcoin. I paid for many services with Bitcoin. It's just that for businesses to accept Bitcoin there must be a quick, easy, and efficient way to get it to fiat. This is why a lot of businesses went with Bitpay - it makes it dead simple (for a fee, obviously).
Also, don't think I support Bitpay, either. I had a Bitpay card but I no longer use it.

Probably someone else mentioned this, but a best practice when mixing banking and crypto is to have a crypto-only bank account that is separate from your day-to-day bank account. Compartmentalization is important in all aspects of life and security.

The Ledger Nano S has a "secret passphrase" option that you can use to "hide" your Bitcoins behind a long passphrase and second PIN. Research this. Might be a great way for you to "hide" your Bitcoins if forced to unlock your Nano.


In one way yes, but if you have 20+ passwords it's going to be damn near impossible to memorize all of them and never forget even one while also abiding by password rules (complexity, length, age, etc). In my own life I have 50+ important accounts and I don't know a single password to any of them. In some cases, I don't even know the usernames I used for them! It's all random and I couldn't be forced to give anyone my Gemini credentials since I don't know them. Even better is that when I travel back home (USA), before I go through CBP I delete my password manager and login credentials to it so that I couldn't be forced to unlock anything (I keep backups at home and in another secure location). If CBP gave me a hard time, seized my laptop, and demanded passwords I literally could not tell them. I won't lie to them because I could honestly say "I'm sorry officer but I don't know my passwords. They are at home and you don't have jurisdiction there."
For all of your important accounts, you should use a password manager AND 2-factor authentication. My preference is using a phone app such as Authy. Then even if someone broke into your password manager (unlikely if you secure it and your environment) they would still need your 2nd-factor to get in. With most accounts you'll be alerted to confirm any unusual logins. Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini all do this plus most major banks.


Never assume this. Someone might target you just because they think you have something or they just see an opportunity.

Are you saying that people will move their fiat to Bitcoin when the economy slows? If so, then I think the opposite will happen. Lots of speculative investors will just pull their money out of Bitcoin to cover losses they see in the fiat markets.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:30:03
Is it just me or do these types of account closures happen more often when the price goes up? Is it because of increases in prices means increases activity and therefore  more cases of "prohibited activities"?
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:19:32
Part of me thinks that AML activities slow down when there isn't a lot of business. Basically let things slip because too much enforcement will drive away business. I mean, they'd go after the obvious cases of money laundering or spending money at shady sites... but I bet edge cases are let go in favor or the business. When activity picks up, they have more room in the revenue stream to ban edge case users.
