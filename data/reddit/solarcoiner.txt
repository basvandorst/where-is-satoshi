All I had to do was read the first sentence. Why do you think coinbase is not profitable? Look at BTCE. They make so much cash with a 0.2% fee on trading. Its pathetic. All you have to do is listen to your customers. If they want to trade litecoin fucking add it so people can trade it and you can earn fees. It's really as simple as that. I could have thought of 3-4 other coins to add instead of adding etherium. But hey maybe coinbase isn't looking to make a profit. I know for a fact that there are many other crypto companies out there that make loads of cash.

If you really wanted to trade BTC/USD you can do that on a bunch of different exchanges. I have been using btce for years now and guess what. I didn't loose anything on mt gox, cryptsy or bitfinex. They also dont care where you are from. Just deposit BTC and get started. You can then sell the btc you make on other exchanges or on localbitcoins. easy

Thats bad luck. Next time dont keep your FTC on btc-e
You should have though about the fact that they will take your cheap coins? Why are they taking the coins? might they be undervalued? Next time keep your coins in a wallet where you control the private keys. Or put the FTC on an exchange where you can actually sell them ;) btce is not a online wallet

Because it has been around for longer than any other exchange in the bitcoin industry. And that counts for something. Yes they might be criminals but they know how to run an exchange and they will never run off with your cash because on a bad day they make 100k + USD in profits from traders and on a good day they can make millions. Its as simple as that

Alright I get your point. However I just think Bitcoin is too big to be manipulated on such a large scale..It gets traded worldwide on 100's of exchanges and face to face using local bitcoins...People would notice if the buy orders were really fake. The order books of most exchanges are actually quite transparent. If have done a lot of trades that have goon quite deep into the orderbook and I can confirm that I almost always get the amount that is displayed as a total. Of course that can vary because some people might cancel a buy or sell order right before you buy/sell. But think about it. How would you fake prices all around the world with all the different currencies?

How about you change the data on your website accordingly. You should be making people aware of the fact that it can take ages for their funds to arrive. Instead of advertising super fast trades

You are all idiots. What did you think. That the ETH news was only bad for ETH? how do you think ETH are cashed out into the real world. Everyone here is pathetic writing things like eth is doomed. All you had to do was think a little more and maybe you would understand why btc is falling
@_date: 2016-06-21 11:37:02
haha ETH lives off of BTC. You can be happy we are still over 600$ Good luck if you don't understand that BTC is what makes ETH possible

Shapeshift is a joke and im suprised they can still legally say their average trade is something like 20 seconds. What a joke. On average I have to wait anywhere between 30 to 120 minutes for anything to happen. This is because they have to wait for a confirmation. They are crooks. they say you will get your coins instantly but in reality the exchange rate will change untill it finally goes through when your btc gets a confirmation. What a bad way of doing business

Try to understand a free market...There is no real or fake price. There is just the price that people are willing to pay for a given ''good'' (in this case bitcoin) The price of bitcoin is simply supply and demand. Right now less people are selling and more people are buying. So the price is going up. If you go onto any exchange and sell bitcoin you will receive the amount of dollars people are willing to pay for it. Right now that would be around 645$. Of course you would have to own bitcoin to sell some ;)
Edit:  Exchanges don't report the prices. They simply let people trade securely for a small fee so the traders are basically creating the price ;) Its not like back in the old days where 80% of trading was done on MTGOX. Websites like coindesk report a average price between several exchnanges which is probably the most accurate way to check Bitcoins price

It sounds like you want to buy BTC with $?  You get more BTC at a cheaper price ;) so whats up?
