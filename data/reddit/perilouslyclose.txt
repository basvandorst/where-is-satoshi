because each subreddit effectively functions as an independent positive feedback loop.  That positive feedback loop conflicts with this one is all.

bitcoin was designed to function independently of the banking system.  this does not mean that bankers have to leave their claws off of it once they see the opportunity to charge more fees.

i've seen a lot of technical chart based analysis posted here and eleswhere.  i don't remember a time i saw technical analysis make an accurate prediction about bitcoin or anything else (stocks, etc...).  stick to fundamentals.  supply and demand set price; not technical analysis predictions
What about the supply or demand of bitcoin is going to change on April 11th? 
@_date: 2019-03-07 05:50:12
bitcoin transactions per day bottomed on 4/1/18, price bottomed on 12/15/18, mining difficulty hit bottom on 12/19/18.  i'm pretty sure the bear has already gone back into hibernation
@_date: 2019-03-29 04:35:29
people on this forum have also been insisting for years that, "bitcoin is bad for bankers."  i sense a contradiction.
either bitcoin is bad for bankers or bankers are also profiting off of bitcoin.  one of these assertions can not be true.

obviously facts don't really matter but, Buffet owns less than 9% of Wells Fargo
@_date: 2019-03-12 03:29:58
Headline refers to Wells Fargo as "Buffet's Wells Fargo".  That it ain't.  Headline deviates from the facts to serve a dishonest agenda.  Buffet owns some stock in practically everything.  Cherry picking his stocks to make him look like a bad guy is a dishonest agenda.
Buffet isn't Carl Icahn.  Buffet manages a stock portfolio.  He doesn't manage the dozens of companies in that portfolio.
@_date: 2019-03-12 03:47:15
how does "going after Buffet" help anybody with anything?  what did he do wrong to anybody ever?  did he voice an opinion you didn't like so now you need revenge, or what?
@_date: 2019-03-11 04:19:10
believe! believe!
i know you don't want any money and you just want bitcoin to be allowed to save the world but, there is money to be made here too.  let people do what they want and don't worry so much about it

and they will buy most of their bitcoins from crypto exchanges and atms which are owned and operated by crypto bankers.  problem solved
@_date: 2019-03-04 19:04:28
i'm not saying its a bad/good thing; i'm saying its an objectively true thing.  this sub loves upvoting pics of atms AND memes of bankers pwned by bitcoin.  this is what orwell was talking about when he coined the term "doublethink."  i am suggesting that those who still believe that cryptocurrency is bad for banking could re-calibrate their thinking to be more in line with objective reality.
@_date: 2019-03-11 02:00:29
What evidence do you have that Buffet is a fraud or that anyone has ever lost any money following his advice or investing in Berkshire Hathaway?  I'm sure he can buy more lambos with his billions in "fake money" than you can with all your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:22:08
seriously, how do you people not see that there is a banking infrastructure being built up around bitcoin as we watch?  bakkt, atms, etfs, etc...  does anyone on reddit know what "atm" stands for?  a teller is a bank employee.  when you pay an atm fee you are giving your money to a banker.  bankers love bitcoin because more fees.
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:09:44
color and number does not matter. a lightning bolt "s" is always going to be the equivalent of a swastika in many people's minds.
@_date: 2019-03-11 02:12:51
Buffet does not "represent legacy financial infrastructures."  he's a stock market guy who became a billionaire by figuring out early in life the quickest way to use common sense to make lots of money.  Bitcoin believers accuse him of being aligned with the banks because he owns stock in banks, but they fail to acknowledge that he owns stock in everything else also.
Buffet doesn't like Bitcoin for the same reason he doesn't like gold.  Its daily price is based on 90% speculation and 10% actual usefulness.
@_date: 2019-03-11 02:22:03
if bitcoin bad for banks who own all them atms and exchanges?  jus some rich non banker bitches?
@_date: 2019-10-01 20:59:22
How does Bitcoin help me with the trade war? And who pays money out of their own pocket to advertise bitcoin and why?  It makes bitcoin look like even more of a ponzi scheme when people who own bitcoin pay money to try to get others to buy in.
@_date: 2019-10-01 16:07:36
Hey, how about don't advise people to put their money into bitcoin right before  a dip, unless you know they can handle the dip.  How about don't advise people to invest in an investment vehicle that is know for short term volatility, unless you know they are fine with short term volatility.  How about that?
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:07:46
to be honest, i feel the almost exactly the same.  but, about bitcoin related stocks; not bitcoin its self
@_date: 2019-02-27 04:26:01
not true.
what is a bitcoin atm owner/operator if not a banker?
what is bakkt (sibling organization to the NYSE) doing if not developing bitcoin based financial services?
what is a banker if not someone who charges fees for financial services?
bankers love bitcoin because more financial services equals more fees. 
@_date: 2019-12-20 21:18:29
Green Wallet is crap.  I had them on my chrome browser, then one day (in 2015 when BTC was about $230-250) I had to update my browser and my pass phrase hasn't worked ever since.  They refuse to do anything about it, and they are keeping my bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-11 04:41:50
the proliferation of bitcoin atms, exchanges, futures trading, and etfs are all evidence that bitcoin is working out well for bankers.  i am aware of no evidence that shows that bitcoin is threatening the baking sector.  i am being selective here.  i am selecting real evidence over an easily falsifiable belief system
@_date: 2019-04-11 01:51:50
i'm not making an argument/hypothesis.  i'm making an observation.  my observation is that a) many bitcoin enthusiasts still repeatedly proclaim that bitcoin is/will be bad for banks, and b) actually, bitcoin is providing additional revenue streams for bankers while there is still no evidence of any damage or potential damage occuring to banks or bankers.
my observation IS accurate because it is based on what is happening right in front of my eyes.
@_date: 2019-04-11 01:43:14
Meanwhile, in the real world bitcoin has only generated new revenues for bankers (atms, futures trading, etfs, etc..).
@_date: 2019-04-10 00:05:50
evidence would be a banker who has lost a job because bitcoin.  we are ten years in and this has not happened, and isn't going to happen.  the evidence shows that bankers are only more prosperous because of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-02 01:05:40
This looks like classic doublethink to me.  I have seen lots of real evidence that bitcoin is increasing profit opportunities for bankers and i have seen no evidence of "displacement".
@_date: 2019-01-31 23:49:50
this is some b.s.
i know that for many bitcoin enthusiasts this will interfere with your confirmation bias but here, let me simplify it for you.  mining bitcoin requires electricity.  electricity is the flow of electrons.  when an electron flows into your computer, you do not get to choose if that electron came from a coal plant or a wind farm.
consuming electricity does in fact still contribute to global warming.

an atm owner/operator is a banker.  he maintains a money supply (known as a bank) to facilitate other people's transactions.  he then takes a percentage of those transactions as profit without creating any new money.  a bitcoin atm owner/banker does not need to create money to make profits.
@_date: 2019-05-13 08:18:27
the thing that banks monetize well is facilitating people's need to participate in financial transactions.  they already do this with bitcoin using atms, exchanges, etfs, etc.  and the banks will only become more dominant with crypto like they did with traditional money
@_date: 2019-05-13 08:31:46
there is no real evidence to ignore; of banks closing or bankers making less money or getting fired because bitcoin.  the real evidence that you are ignoring is that the introduction of crypto currency has only increased banker's opportunities to make money, and the reason is clear.  many bitcoin enthusiasts dislike the idea of bankers profiting off their transactions and want to believe that bitcoin participation will punish those bankers.  meanwhile, bitcoin is turning more regular people into bankers (atm owner/operators)every day.
