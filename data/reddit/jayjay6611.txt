I dont know if I could sleep at night knowing I lost something so valuable.  Honestly, that must really be difficult.

Thanks for that info, I'm clearly still learning.

Sent some Bitcoin and Litecoin to segwit addresses on my ledger wallet last night at the exact same time, the bitcoin transaction was confirmed first in a little over a minute.

I was just about to get my first payout too.  Fingers crossed that this is all going to get sorted out.

Yup, that sucks.  But at the end of the day I'm realistically only out about $20 in electricity costs for the period of time that my unpaid mining took place.  I feel bad for the people who've lost much more.

I hope the folks at CNBC see this and realize exactly who it is they keep featuring.

The Ledger Nano S is another good option

Thank you for sharing this article,  as a relative newcomer to crypto it really helped me understand what the hell is going on just a little bit better.

Might be worth mentioning the amount of data that is used.  Some of us still live in the dark ages and have a cap on monthly data.  I'd love to run a full node but my 300gb cap wouldn't last long.

Back in 2011 I initially heard about bitcoin and had an extra $1000 CAD I had saved that I wanted to invest but I couldn't figure out how to buy it or store it and instead of doing my homework I make the safe choice and bought a lousy GIC at the bank.  My life's biggest regret.   After watching bitcoin skyrocket and thinking it was "too late now" I came to my senses and have started buying a small amount here and there.  Now that I understand more about it I'm hopeful that the technology and the coin itself can truly be something that changes the world one day.

I'm new to crypto, but I've been trying to do my homework and understand what is going on.  Everywhere I look for information I find conflict and accusations.  It's getting harder and harder for me to filter all the information out there and really see the big picture.

That graph looks exactly like Apple's stock history... Hmmm
