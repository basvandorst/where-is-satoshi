Which address? This was sent to my wallet, I can view the transaction but it is still "pending" and will not "complete".

Also, I am using coinbase and have reached out to them multiple times about this but they just send me the typical reasons for pending transaction.

In my wallet the money is not available, and it shows as "pending".

Any idea what could be happening?

There is a link in my wallet that lets me view the transaction. Here is the link :  Which address are you asking about?

So you do think it will go through? And which wallet do you recommend?

I'm using coinbase. The money is not available. I can see that the transaction is pending from my wallet, but it will not say that it is complete. The confirmations just keep continuing to rise.

It was sent to me

Coinbase, I've had trouble getting help from them. I've submitted tickets and other than the first general response they haven't gotten back to me with any info. Their call support will only answer general inquiries so I can't even call to speak about it

This is bitcoin that was sent to me, not bought through Coinbase but to my coinbase wallet. The bottom output that ends in "JYKD" is my address that it was sent to. What will the blockchain explorer tell me/what should I look for?
