AI has been known since the 70es, but similar to how Bitcoin, which was already known since the 90es (as Bitgold, a mere idea) was actually not doable until the "Generals' Problem" was solved (math prob), AI wasn't feasible until just recently DNN (on tensor cores) was researched. AI via DNN is indeed new and a complete game-changer. Within a very short time frame after its "discovery", the chinese mega corporation "Tencent" invested around 800 million USD in one go into this new field.

Well, at the very latest point I guess when he started bashing Monero in super-Dunning-Kruger-mode, that was so embarassing, "explaining" how "blockchain cannot be private obviously", oh myyyy gooooooooood.. instant game over. How can anyone buy a book from someone who has so zero theoretical knowledge and "shows off" so cringeworthy with strawman "facts" for everyone to see in plain daylight. It's like one of these 1st semester university lectures where the prof explains some really cool theory and your 1-in-1000 retarded student who has never read/seen anything about it in his life suddenly loudly starts claiming how there must "obviously be a mistake in it and the prof must be totally WRONG" and everyone in the room who actually understands it a bit is like oh-my-god-please-stahp. This guy GUTTED himself on an intellectual level in that video. Actually it was already going downhill when he wasnt able to really explain/answer a question earlier and just repeated unrelated sentences while stating "it's complicated, you know".. but at that point I was still hoping he would still be able make it, lol. Well, it really went downhill after that, sad.
Be that as it may - I did state that his story-mode about gold, money, governments was nice. So that's something. 
Just when you have no idea/expertise of a technical field you are doing heavy judgement on, and with the 3-days-of-reading knowledge level you achieved (tbh what that guy displayed wasn't even 1 day, if done properly) start judging the works of acclaimed cryptographers and mathematicians on that same field, you should really know when to shut up instead of going involuntary-satire-mode. -.-

Is it possible to collect fees by running a watchtower as a service?
The way I understood it, Lightning nodes that aren't online 24/7 require watchtowers to ensure they won't lose funds/get cheated.
So if I could run a 24/7 watchtower and provide its service to non-24/7 Lightning nodes, it's a business model?

@_date: 2018-05-27 08:39:39
Because that newspaper agency doesn't have Lightning support and I think to use LN both sender and receiver must have a LN wallet, right? I think you need to find pretty tech savvy/nerdy businesses for that at this time in adoption.
Regarding LN I have another question:
I'm sometimes paying a friend of mine in bitcoin and he pays 
me too, via our mobile phones. Now I think I read somewhere that LN doesn't support bidirectional transfers yet, so I was wondering what exactly that means. Could we use LN to pay each other back and forth on our mobile 
phones or not? And is it safe? I read you can lose funds if you aren't online 24/7, but is that true only for some node operator or also for simple LN-wallet users like we would be?
(The payments are in the range of 1 to 7$ maybe.)

I'm not sure this question makes thaaat much sense.
As someone who isn't emotionally attached to any particular cryptocurrency except for trying to reminding people to keep civil for the sake of newcomers not getting appalled by the whole crypto scene in general, I think the question doesn't make much sense because as was mentioned by others here it's a "work in progress":
We have many experiments going on in the cryptoscene at once, that aim at delivering payment transfers to an ever-growing number of people hoping to eventually serve every living human being on the planet - this is an empirical experiment, ie something that you try and observe and modify as it goes, similarly how scientists experiment to try and verify their ideas and then change their models as experiment results come in along the way.
I dare say nobody is capable of predicting a perfect model at this early point in time they can be sure to eventually be THE best and guaranteedly fully working model. Especially saying "in its current form" - what is that form? An experiment is currently built and will surely be modified and expanded on as first results come in. It's pointless to compare the current state with a particular state in the far future as if there was nothing more that could/should happen on the way there - how could anyone possibly know all this for sure now?
So I'm not trying to express any subjective favour of my own by listing the following experimenting options, but I just do it from an objective standpoint:
There are two main lines of experimenting this way. 1) Delegating scaling on multiple layers, 2) Trying to not delegate scaling to multiple layers.
Note that 2) is done by many different cryptos but also as far as I know LN will allow atomic swaps, so the borders are not really clear cut.
There's also 3), a combination of 1+2, which is actually the status quo for BTC right now: You can make on-chain payments but also second-layer payments.
At this point in time I find it a a bit nonsensical to claim to KNOW with certainty which models will turn out how in the far future
If we compare it to the higgs boson: Scientists said this must exist, otherwise it all won't work out, but they also said, in case it doesn't exist, very exciting other things might be happening in the future - this is the experimental nature: Scientists have an idea what is probably the best way, but they won't dare to claim they KNOW how everything will turn out in the end, instead they keep rational and humble, weighing everything and trying to make the best objective choices.
Remember the saying (approx) "Doubt those who said they found the truth, believe into those who say they're looking for it".

Your attempt in all honour, but people who are like "XYZ is all fraud!!1 they are shilling bastards and cult blabla!1", no matter what XYZ actually is and whether it in fact might be a fraud or not, will never even realize nor understand how childish this kind of talk looks to neutral observers (comparable to Dunning-Kruger effect to some extent), so it will usually be wasted effort.
It's like the two kids "fighting" by just repeating "he started it" "no it was him" "no him" "no him" etc pp.
Maybe people will at least understand that you win a fight by being better and delivering on it, not by shit-talking your opponent. It will just backfire as people will be appalled by such low-level behaviour.

It's mindblowing that this even needs to be said:
NOBODY WHO WANTS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY WOULD ATTACK HIS "ENEMY" WITH SILLY HATE COMMENTS. 
Even more so, if some company manager were ever to behave like this against their rival company, he would actually have a good chance to get fired.
This just needs to stop, as it just hurts crypto adotion itself and contributes NOTHING. Just "hating" is what toxic trolls do, while community members that provide actual *worth* are constructive instead. 
Maybe they should actually start teaching this in school or something.
Toxicity (of course I'm including those over at who bash BTC equivalently, and all other trolls anywhere) contributes NOTHING, it will help your position in NO WAY, it's just the trash of any community and it HURTS ONE'S OWN AGENDA to behave disgracefully like this.

So what ARE the fees?
For half a year now I could no longer buy my fav newspaper's articles with bitcoin on my mobile phone because of fees, I was hoping this becomes possible soon again, so does Bitcoin work again for my real life scenario or still no?
If fees are 4c I could finally buy those articles again, if it's $1 then of course not (an article costs like 25c).
Please, can someone enlighten everyone, what are the fees really like right now?
In my opinion Bitcoin lost major ground during the past half a year because of the circumstances explained in this post, it wasn't just that newspaper agency. I really hope the situation will improve ASAP.
People tend to be like "Hey LN is coming, it's all great" but I can tell you as someone who actually does REAL WORLD USAGE of Btc and who is not religious to any particular currency that the situation has dramatically gotten worse over the past half a year, at which time I had been able to really use Btc in great ways, simply because of that fees thing.
I'm sorry to say it like this, but I don't think people who don't actually use Btc in real life but who just read cointelegraph articles or reddit posts have really noticed and actually understood this in its full dimensions.

You might claim that and maybe for some way of your payments that is true, but not for paying newspaper articles on mobile phone:
I just checked the Bitcoin Wallet for Android again to see if it really gives 4c fees
  ( from the official site  )
but it still wants to use 0.15 mBTC as transaction fees for a 0.05 mBTC transaction, so that's over 1$ fee for a newspaper article payment of around 40c, so no, for a normal user like me Bitcoin still unusable in this normal real-life scenario trusting the official recommendations.
I'm not saying that you are lying about the 4 cents thing, but it seems you have to be tech-savvy and know how to achieve that, maybe only possible for very specific transaction things? I have no idea, while it's not possible for "normal" users that just get Android Bitcoin Wallet and want to do their normal life small payments.

Admitted, it will scale much worse than other currencies due to its technical overhead that comes as the price to pay for privacy.

SiDisNotKING, disregard the nonsense above. ;) The person saying "stupid question" is actually stupid. In general, asking questions is the way to go! Always ask, to gather information and opinions, then form your own one. Make sure you ask different people (parents, friends, random people on the internet, read different news sites and also try newspapers), so you can get different opinions. That will help you understand things from all angles. Be prepared that people who answer you have their own plans in mind that they want to convince you
Bitcoin has been acknowledged by the government as perfectly legal, and it's like "online money". So same as you're allowed having dollar notes in your wallet and buy stuff, you're allowed having Bitcoin! You can also exchange/sell it to your friends if you want to, no problem, or buy stuff with it. Of course you shouldn't try to buy illegal stuff like some firearms or drugs with it, as Bitcoin can get tracked to an extent by law enforcement - something many people don't realize. Be careful though when trading bitcoin in real life with strangers outside of actual shops, they might try to rob your phone and run off with your bitcoin, if you had them stored on your phone, for example.

How did you do that? I tried recently to post a link to an article about Bitcoin that also mentioned that coin and got an automatic system msg that my post was deleted because it mentions that coin (tm).. o_O which was pretty silly because the article was very interesting and about Bitcoin too.
Actually it was so stupid and patronizing that I considered stopped using this sub, LOL rage! xD
Ok but seriously, together with Monero, BTC is my favourite coin, but if there is ONE thing I can absolutely not tolerate anywhere it's not be allowed free speech. Does not blend with crypto. Beep! Fastest way to lose community imo.
Also, everybody knows the best possible strategy is always to just shoot the messenger. All news should be postable if they are relevant/important for BTC, whatever they mention and also if they're not all hurrayhurrayhurray but have something to criticize. Those are actually the really important news.
Well, I didn't try to repost that article, even though it had interesting info about PR/marketing, because the auto message said that you get banned if you tried to "circumvent it".

@_date: 2018-06-02 11:24:55
Well, Litecoin is technically no different.
The reason people say BCH is scam is that Roger Ver tries to make people believe that BCH is actually Bitcoin, instead of Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin is actually an altcoin. Which means Roger Ver (and others who do this) are scams.
That doesn't really make the coin itself a scam though, as a coin is merely a technical protocol that has no will or personality, lol.
"It pretends.." nothing, for exactly this reason, rather it is the most loudmouth prominent proponents of it who may pretend and scam, not the coin protocol "itself".
What I'm aiming at is - assume suddenly the whole BCH personnel was switched out to different people, no more Roger Ver etc, it might just as well suddenly become a very normal coin much like Litecoin, where nobody goes full retard anymore when it is mentioned anywhere. And the coin protocol itself might very well have its good use cases as any other coin might have, depending on what fits your needs.

You might be right, or you might not be right. And I'm not saying you are wrong. I am, however, saying that your post currently does not contain any valuable information or argument towards this discussion - because it contains no _definition_:
Whenever there is a chainsplit due to protocol changes there is no way to objectively just say which of the resulting forks "is" the original. It's not me or you or anyone's fault that this is so.
To be able to decide which one is (closer to) the original, it is required to list the _defining points_ of X (in this case of Bitcoin), _before_ and _after_ the fork, so we can compare objectively and see which fork matches those points and argue about which points make sense and which might not.
So, please state your definition of Bitcoin here so we can compare its points with the resulting forks to see which makes more sense. It is so tiring to see posts stating what X/Y/Z "is" while lacking any definition of X/Y/Z in it, that is just spam.

umm not sure if this is a satire post, but since the actual amount transferred doesn't matter much in crypto, $5 is a hell of a huge fee.

Well, a massive accumulation of gold on an asterioid is pretty unlikely, because gold is just rather randomly created, like most other elements, from super novas et al.
What is much more likely is actually a massive amount of diamond, because since diamond is just a structurally special version of mere carbon (can be created from common carbon by extremely high pressure industrially) and carbon is a very, very common element throughout the universe, a massive diamondish asteroid would be much more likely.

Oh yes, routing-easiness vs routing-size is also an interesting min/max problem, didn't think about that yet.
I guess I will rephrase my original question too for clarity:
What happens if due to popularity of on-chain transactions the on-chain transaction fees for closing (certain smaller ie on less central hubs) lightning channels become larger than the fees those channels generate for their operator? (Assuming a fixed time period after which they need to be closed to pay for things like electricity/hardware.)

Btcpay looks good. Is there any service company that can set it up for him? He cannot do github-stuff and such on his own, he has no idea of pc programming. Basically just so he inputs the amount(s) to be paid, and so he can confirm it has been paid, so the customer is good to go, that's it.

Although hash power seems like an arbitrarily picked metric, I guess it could be picked in the absence of any other factors, hm.
But in case, if from a team of 8 there would be a difference in opinion of 7 people vs 1 person, if the one person now happens to have the major hashpower, somehow he is the "majority". Seems a bit strange. But I guess it's ok if you assume that "the community shall decide" as the credo of the whole thing.

Actually I disagree. Sure you can always zoom out far enough to find a time where BTC was worth less, but actually if you zoom out it looks like BTC entered a serious downward trend now.

Ok, well to me it looked like one guy shouts "No, it's green!" and the other one shouts "No, it's heavy!" aka disjunct attributes leading to no sensible outcome, no matter whether it actually IS green or not.
Actually I am an r/Monero fan simply because it is a community which can discuss things without anyone abusing it for relieving his primal needs to bash others. And I would like r/Bitcoin and r/btc both arrive at this level too. I hate this permanently continued fight that takes on religious levels.
And yes, of course it's a fork, code-wise. What else would it be. But I won't pretend I didn't understand what the other guy was trying to convene.
In real life if I see someone start shouting in a discussion instead of providing rational arguments, he is dead to me. And same online aka someone whose posting only consists of "scam! idiots! stupid!". I just cannot take people seriously who think they make a point by behaving like monkeys. I hope this pointless war that is bad for both sides and only serves to repel anyone who comes from the outside into cryptocurrency-space will end at some point.

@_date: 2018-07-06 16:55:28
What I am saying is that a protocol itself is not a scam, only people can be scammers. So calling BCH "a scam" is as meaningful as calling a knife a crime.
Also I don't assume you want to insinuate that every person working on BCH is a scammer.
Talking about scammers, the top scammer in the whole cryptoscene is certainly CSW, but I do not consider him a "contributor" to anything at all, except to clown-style entertainment perhaps.
Also Roger Ver can be considered a scammer as he tried to mislead people.
Do you know of any other scammer? Please enlighten us.

ohh, I didn't know that. I always thought that a pre-fork client could not distinguish which post-fork code variant was "more original", because I assumed that both resulting lines of code incorporate changes that distinguish each of them from the original line in some way. I thought that was precisely why you suddenly hold funds in both resulting wallets afterwards, when you had funds in the pre-fork wallet.
I'm still not sure WHY a pre-fork client would sync with a particular variant, ie BTC instead of BCH, though. Can someone explain it technically how it recognizes its "real child" o_O?
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:55:52
Are you sure about that and not confusing it with some other project? I just went on the openbazaar.org site to read about it and it has BTC everywhere in its pics and explanations, BCH nowhere to be seen. Even the "feature" symbol in the top left corner of the whole site is a BTC icon. On a side note, I'd avoid using the term "shilling" because it sounds a bit immature, it has been overused in knee-jerk reactions on certain crypto subreddits.
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:16:27
Didn't bch and btc have the same root they forked off? Isn't the discussion what "bitcoin" is rather philosophical and would basically depend on which of the resulting forks technically "looks more similar" to the pre-fork bitcoin? Or maybe Bitcoin "is" simply what satoshi wrote in his whitepaper titled "bitcoin"? Are there any kind of comparison tables that lists the aspects of both fork results and then compare them to the whitepaper contents Satoshi provided maybe, for an easy overview for the uninitiated?
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:45:25
^ rofl, this kind of screeching rage-posting is basically the best explanation as to "what has been going on" (with both sides' er "fans" of course, as expected from humans in general). And before I started reading crypto-subs on reddit apparently there was also a lot of censorship going on, some people posted logs as "proofs", but I personally have no idea where to find those or how proofy they are (I'm sort of a reddit noob, so). However, censorship of course means an instant loss of legitimation, especially in the cypherpunk world et al.
Monero sub = most civilized and objective crypto sub btw., it's really healing your violated mind after browsing through the BCH-vs-BTC debate all day.
Me personally? I hold all sorts of coins, including BTC and BCH, because I'm not a genius who can see what is going to happen in the future, nor someone who can see through all the technology and know "who is right", and I heed the saying "don't put all your eggs in one basket".

I own BTC and BCH (and other coins too, I like Monero for it's privacy features and its civil and technical sub) and I would be interested in adoption in general.
A year ago I actually paid newspaper articles with BTC on a per article basis, so it would be like 25 cents per article, I forgot how much that was in BTC. However, this no longer worked due to the fees becoming too high in comparison to that amount. I would like to resume that model but the "Bitcoin Wallet" app I have on Android wants to add 0.12 mBTC fee which is like 3x-4x the amount the actual article costs -_- and it cannot be changed, so for many months now I wasn't able to do that newspaper article thing anymore which made me pretty sad.
That said, I'm not specifically pro or against anyone, I just want to PAY STUFF WITH CRYPTO, whenever it's possible.. that's all there is to it!
I consider myself part of the crypto communities but I think you shouldn't presume to speak for me or anyone else except for yourself really. The past half year I HODLed my BTC, simply cause I couldn't spend them as explained above, but not because I'm not wanting adoption, what a stupid nonsense to say.
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:41:17
ok, now it worked. Eclair actually displayed a "-" symbol in the address which caused the wallet to say invalid address. Now with the - removed the address worked.
So I sent around $30 to Eclair and Bitcoin Wallet deducted $1.40 for network fee lol. So at the end of the day I did get ripped off.. there seemed to be no way to change the fee in the wallet app, god dammit.
Now in Eclair I found the open-channel thing, but it has 4 choices:
- paste node uri
- scan node uri
- random node
- acinq node
Which one am I supposed to click..?

@_date: 2019-05-02 08:37:00
Yeah was thinking the same - basically Bitfinex didn't do anything wrong in the beginning, it was just major oppression from state (making nonsensical "laws" KYC/AML) and banks to deny people's privacy and freedom that caused all of this.

CryptoPersia didn't ask about a limit but about 0 x infinity. You could argue he asked the wrong question I guess.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:39:23
I agree about the concept - and that's why if you have zero occurances of that concept, then you just don't have it and also you have none of its implications:
If you look at any arbitrary position in your equation to check whether infinity occurs in it, and you find it exactly zero times (at any location), then it is simply not there.
In other words, if I ask you "How many times did you add infinity to that '1' you wrote down earlier?" and you reply "Oh zero times, I didn't want to add it." then what do you have there? Exactly '1' still. Not an indeterminate expression.
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:38:40
By "replenishing from fiat" I mean that you keep the exact same amount of btc, before and after the purchase. So I don't see how a problem with Gresham's law here. We are *effectively* keeping all the good money. (Of course you need to replenish right away, not some hours later when btc value might already have changed.)
After the purchase you have less fiat than before, so fiat - the "bad money" - is the only thing you effectively spent.

Hm it was "Bitcoin Wallet" which is the first wallet listed officially on bitcoin.org under android wallets...
Anyway, thanks, I'll go with Acinq then because I don't really like any "direct" connections to vendors, same with bonus cards and all that crap, it just feels invading my privacy somehow.
So acinq says:
Fees 64 sat/byte - fast (20 minutes)
And it asks "use all available funds" and also "request liquidity from this node".. should I check one of these two or both or none? I guess available funds means that I can use all $30 with lightning, and no longer with normal on-chain transfers, correct? But what is the second question about?
*edit: Since you mentioned almost instant transactions, how do I do that instead of the "20 minutes"?
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:16:39
Learn logic first. If I say "hey, here's a 'one'. Now let's add infinity to it!" and you say "ah no, let's not add infinity,", then I say "ohh I asked you this today so often, but you agreed exactly zero times to add infinity to it, well sorry, your 1 is now undefined!".
Solution: The "undefined" value is merely a (partial) agreement to provide meaning to certain fields of calculations. It has no *universal* validity.

An infinite amount of zeroes will never go above zero, so it is zero.
Zero infinities means no infinity at all, same as zero amount of anything else, so that is zero too.
(*Of course multiplication is commutative, I'm merely providing two different interpretations.)
Side note: What *is* generally undefined indeed is 0 to the power of 0. It is defined as 1 only in certain contexts (which admittedly are quite large in regards of fields of mathematics, eg Google will claim that it is 1 in its integrated calculator), but not in all contexts.

What's the maximum electricity cost per kWh for this to break even with the fees you get?

Thanks, I understand your concerns. Don't worry, I'm willing to experiment here. If I weren't the "now I wanna succeed with this!" type of person but a "normal user" I probably wouldve long just gone with kinguin's BCH option to live a troublefree life lol.
Yes, I agree the "liquidity" option sounds pointless for me, so I decided to put all funds in there but leave that one unchecked.
Status is now WAIT_FOR_FUNDING_C... (rest is cut off), which I assume will take those 20 minutes now. It's my first attempt to do this lightning stuff, as you probably noticed..
The rest should be selfexplaining I guess, so thanks for your patience, I should be fine from here on.
One more question that is not really important for this particular use case of buying a game:
In eclair options I saw "Enable receive over lightning" which makes sense if I want to pay a friend of mine or rather if he wants to pay me, but it says "Make sure your phone doesnt stay without internet for more than two weeks" - what the hell :)
I mean my phone PROBABLY wont have bigger internet breaks than a day, but still, that sounds pretty scary. It doesnt say any more, so what happens IF I lose internet? Could be on holidays somewhere where I cannot use the mobile net for example. Would I just lose all the money that people sent me via lightning so far?

Not while USD is still in use, because the total amount of money in circulation would be way too great for 1M$/BTC to be realistic otherwise.
However, danish Saxo Bank analysts think that 100 000 USD / btc is possible in 2027.

Well people have done that in 1913 and up till today without it ever been changed:
The Federal Reserve is a private corporation that holds power at their whim over all of the money in the US and nobody does anything against it. Yet nobody else is allowed to create their own private money, only this corporation is for some reason.
