After reading [the interview]( with the brain behind ETC, I came to the conclusion that I'm a ["radical crypto-decentralist"]( like him and therefore I feel obliged to support ETC and punish ETH by doing so.
And about those smartest minds ETC is missing; ETC will simply merge all ETH's updates, except the DAO revert parts.

When was this comment made? I think Andreas was talking about [the fork that happened in '13]( and the way that worked out.
There's a huge difference in a far ahead pre-planned hard-fork ([with the potential of building in preventions for replay attacks]( with huge consensus and a hard-fork that's planned in a hurry (no protection against replay attacks), is going against the core principles of a blockchain and is done purely because big investors f*cked up.

Queal is my standard diet and only every now and then, on special occasions, I eat something "normal". So I'm like living for 80-90% on this stuff and I feel great. It's a fascinating idea that just about all of my skin, nails, guts and hair is now entirely made from Queal by now.
Considering the time I win by not having to come up with what to eat, to buy the ingredients, to cook and to clean /every single day/ is mind-blowing.
I don't:
* have to make sure I eat a diet with enough variety
* eat animal meat
* eat bad fats
* eat direct glucose
* eat any cholesterol
* eat too much salt
* have to worry about calories
* have to worry about my fiber intake
* ever feel hungry (stomach volume shrinks over time)
* ever have to throw spoiled food away
* produce much garbage
And above all of that, I always drink enough water by default.

Queal tastes a lot better to me and my whole family.
[Answer on the amount of protein](
Maltodextrin is a medium-long chain of glucose units with a semi-high glycemic index (GI). The role of maltodextrin in the blend is to raise your sugar level in your blood in the short term, so the lower GI oats can provide the sugars over the next few hours. Why so much maltodextrin? I'm not sure. The official Soylent lowered it from 165g to 70g in update 1.4, so I suppose Joylent and Queal will follow eventually.

"The concept of emergence refers to the coming out of new properties linked to the complexity of an organization. In scientific context, self-organization models have an important place in the formalization of emergence."

Which version of core are you using? A version that's pre-Bitcoin Core 0.13.0?
Since 13, Core uses HD key generation for new wallets by default. After a little Googling: "The most common advice is to start using the HD format is to send the bitcoins in your old wallet.dat bitcoins into a newly generated and empty HD wallet. You would need to create a new and empty HD wallet, create a receiving addresses and then send the bitcoins to it.".

* In the contacts overview, make it easy distinguish verified contacts from non-verified contacts
* Change "Create Address" to "Create new Address"
* Add bits as optional coin unit
* Make 2FA codes visible
* Add personal messaging

From [coinsafe.com](
"You're going to generate passwords using /dev/random as your CSPRNG. Out of an abundance of caution, you first want to top up the entropy pool so that an attacker couldn't just duplicate these steps to "randomly" generate your same private keys. Provide /dev/random with some more environmental noise by following two steps:
* Move the mouse around as randomly as you can for at least 30 seconds (more time welcome).
* Open a text pad and bang on the keyboard for hundreds of characters (more welcome). Try to randomize not just what you type, but the timing between keystrokes as well"
[Here]( a note on the /dev/random over /dev/urandom discussion.
Edit: I'm not sure if entropy collected during a Linux installation is actually stored. Most Linux distro's install in a live environment?

Sorry, I tried to expand to the other valid comments already given, but tried to give more technical details if you were interested.
The Ledger Nano has an industry standard chip on-board that's also used in the banking world. They should last about 30 years when used on a regular basis.
Besides that, like the others said: if you store the BIP-0032 seed phrase the Nano generates, which is also a widely and very well specified industry standard by now, so you can always recover all your private keys on almost any other device or software.
Some tips for storing your seed long term:
* Use a dumb printer that does not have any network-features or internal storage.
* Non-laser printers may cause the ink to run if the paper gets wet.
* Use highly graded paper (Text and Cover papers) and laminate it.
* Use the Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme (SSSS) to break your seed up in multiple papers encrypted with AES256. This gives the ability to store these shards in multiple geographically separated locations to protect from physical theft, fire, flood ect.
* Stamp your seed in steel. Google Cryptosteel for example.
* Give steganography a look

Indeed, it would be better to create a distro for it. 
The pi 2 is very interesting because it's probably the cheapest hardware you can buy that can function as a good full node.
Btw, bitcoind is currently [present in debian testing]( so it should be easy to install and maintain it on Debian as well.
