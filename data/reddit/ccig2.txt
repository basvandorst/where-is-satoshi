I'm just going on the conversations I'm hearing with normies at the gym and at school.
The first week of December every personal trainer at my gym had bumped in a thousand or two of their personal savings. And I was hearing conversations at my university about business students buying in.
Now? All of them have sold at a loss, and tell others Bitcoin is like Herbalife. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 06:13:38
If they all put in $1000 each, that's only 1 billion total -- compared to Bitcoin's market cap of $187 billion and it would only account for a slight move.
Those institutional funds are what will get us over the top, they're slated to come through at the end of Q1
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:17:12
Yeah, I diversified too at first. I came to the same conclusion. I cashed out my Eth and Litecoin weeks ago and only have Bitcoin now, way happier. 
To 'diversify' I bought up some shares of Microsoft, Apple, and Square.

I was interested in NEO till I looked into it and I came to the same conclusion as you. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:41:33
I think that money will come right back in as soon as BTC gets a leap and they want back in.
Of course soon thereafter they'll want out again when the price plateaus.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:26:17
Spiked $1000 in the span of a half-hour at 6:30AM Eastern. 
Looks to me like the money that was pumped into the alts made its way back into BTC. Anyone else seeing the same thing? 
If so, it bodes well for us.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:52:35
I think it sets us up for a nice bull run--all the weak hands, worldwide, have gotten out.

Somewhere, on a 60-ft yacht racing away from shore, are a dozen Instagram models in a rugby-style dogpile.
Wait. Look closer. Someone's at the bottom of the sugar baby dogpile. Who's that?! It's Charlie Lee!!
Charlie Lee, sweaty from cocaine and wearing more gold chains than Rick Ross, bellows to the shore: "I sold all my litecoins to resolve conflicts of interest! I'll continue working in a developmental role!" The yacht races away and disappears into the horizon. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:50:46
That's great news, but it's not going to boost anything in the short-term.
Robinhood has a 200000-person waiting list for crypto accounts; if each person on that waitlist signs up for an account, and buys $1000 worth of Bitcoin or Ethereum, that's only 200 million--it won't make a dent in either Bitcoin or Ethereum. 
Long-term though? It's awesome. Surveys show that millenials are eager to adopt Bitcoin as a value store like gold. When those Robinhood clients invest thousand, after thousand, after thousand into BTC and ETH, then we'll see a nice climb.

Volume is way down.
All the weak hands have shaken out; they were driving frenetic sideways or downwards movement due to FUD. Low volume is great: it's all strong hands and HODLers from here on out. I'll take BTC at 11,000 and in strong hands over BTC at 15,000 on hype and in weak hands any day.

@_date: 2017-12-22 04:19:44
Dip's not over. 
BCH was crashing down from 2500 to 2000. Roger Ver staved off that fatal BCH dip by offloading bitcoins and dropping down our price to 13000.
The threat of these dips won't be up until Bitcoin Cash sinks totally and Ver gives up on his douchebag quest.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:35:36

From Giancarlo's testimony:
"I have spoken publicly about the potential benefits of the technology underlying Bitcoin, namely Blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT). Distributed ledgers – in various open system or private network applications – have the potential to enhance economic efficiency, mitigate centralized systemic risk, defend against fraudulent activity and improve data quality
and governance.  DLT is likely to have a broad and lasting impact on global financial markets in payments, banking, securities settlement, title recording, cyber security and trade reporting and analysis.
When tied to virtual currencies, this technology aims to serve as a new store of value, facilitate secure payments, enable asset transfers, and power new applications."
