Could cryptographic accumulators help handle the TXO size problem? I have only a vague recollection of reading about them in the Zero Coin paper and it seemed to somehow have the ability to say whether an element belonged to a set, without explicitly storing the whole set.

Yep. And I always thought it is particularly egregious that the driver is the only one who gets to wear a seat belt. A complete inversion of incentives and risk management. The opposite of the principle that the captain is the last one to abandon the ship, etc. In fact, if we want to make buses extra safe, there should be seat belts for everyone *except* the driver!

Bitcoin isn't being developed to become digital cash anymore. It is not scaling, and it is not being made more private. Instead it is becoming more of a settlement layer for other "solutions" to work on top of. Nothing wrong with that, except that is not what people bought into when it came out and as it increased in value.
Instead of becoming digital cash, it is becoming a new version of SWIFT...
I think it is a shame that it got so out of its ways, but I am sure the idea won't die, and already we see other technologies making a run for it. I am looking forward to the advent of true e-cash, whatever name it will have, and I wish bitcoiners the best of luck with whatever they are getting into nowadays.

He said that he couldn't tell what was going to happen with the price in the short term, only that Bitcoin's fundamentals were gone, and that therefore long term it should go down in value.
