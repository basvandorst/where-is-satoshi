u/slaxaphonic writes this because he traded all his [Bitcoin for BCash](  and then see it fall 98%. He [borrowed money from friends and family ](  to buy more every way to the bottom. He lost his [life savings](  and are now hugely in depth. He is now [suicidal for his losses. ]( 
He is in such a denial that he [recently posted]( a picture from a two star motel in a third world country, claiming it is his second home. Look at his post history if you want some laughs, but remember that it is so very very sad because everything is just a mirage to hide his gambling addiction even from strangers here on Reddit. 
He used to blame very many people for his losses, including Jihan, Roger Ver and Craig Wright and even his teachers at school. There is a very good summary about u/slaxaphonic and his very tragic story and how he lost it all. You can [read about it here. ](

Im just trying to help him, not shame him in any way. He needs help for his gambling addiction, and I post this just to remind him and to get others to remind him as well to stop gamble. 
He haven’t done anything to me at all. Im just a very nice person, helping a stranger that needs help for his gambling problems. You could say that I’m doing God’s work, I’m totally fine with that.

He says he is suicidal because he is an attention whore that wants people to feel sorry for him. Don’t worry, he will live and hopefully he will get treatment for his gambling addiction one day.
