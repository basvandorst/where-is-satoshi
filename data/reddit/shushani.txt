I would always recommend a hardware wallet, such as Trezor, for storing Bitcoin.

Lol I hope this is copypasta

Place an order to buy or sell some bitcoin automatically at a specified price.will only go through if/when bitcoin's value hits your order price.

"I've been hearing we're going to test 7-9K"
You make it sound as if there's a Bitcoin committee that decides its value.

I just said he ISN’T trying to prove..... so what’s your point?
@_date: 2019-06-14 10:24:56
Bit of chart fuckery going on with different scales etc but is pretty cool that the trends are almost identical when comparing those 2 periods. Obviously doesn’t mean much but just for fun, if BTC continues to follow the same trend then we could expect BTC to hit $60k within the next couple of years.

wakey wakey

Well, yes, it is the same as saying that. And hopefully BTC will also reach new ATHs at some point in the future and we can all enjoy the profits from a blue sky breakout.
But OP's point isn't trying to prove that Bitcoin is a better investment than stocks (or any other investment for that matter). BTC just gets an unfair wrap from the media and general public alike for being an easy way to lose money, when clearly that is not the case.

I personally think we’ll see it sooner rather than later. I don’t claim to be an expert or anything and this is definitely not financial advice ha, but I’m anticipating that we’ll hit $10,000 by the end of next week.

It’s possible to add more decimals in the future if required.

Ahh the good, old $5 wrench attack.

Well not if the position of the words is also self contained - for example imagine if the constituent letters of each word were rotated to the same degree and then the words could be ordered clockwise.

Nice, what do you use to display the BTC price?

How the heck is Daily Mail \*not\* mainstream media?
@_date: 2019-12-16 14:36:41
Well I mean you're not wrong, but it is the  most read news source in the UK. If that's not mainstream media, I'm not sure what is?

God I hate these types of posts. 
One of two things happens: you (by random chance) are right and and you say 'I told you so' or you are wrong and everyone forgets about you. 
Pointless attention whoring trying to make yourself sound super smart. You (and all of us) have no idea what’s going to happen - so we just  cross our fingers and our toes, hope for the best but are cautious of the worst so that we don’t invest more than we can afford to lose.
