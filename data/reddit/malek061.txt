I was always a for bitcoin regulation. The sale of unregulated commodities is dangerous and full of scammers. And, in my opinion, for the price to grow, the bitcoin market needs to be regulated.

I'm not paid. I have just been dealing with rampant fraud in this industry for the past half year and it is tragic how many people were lied to and cheated.

You have to have a series 7 to trade stock and have proper licensing to sell securities and investelments. Bitcoin should be treated like the commodity it acting like and have the proper rules regarding the marketing,  selling , and trading of crypto currency.

I am trying to make the larger point that should all people promoting crypto currencies, including bitcoin, be subject to the anti-fraud laws enacted by the United States. To me, it seems like an unregulated currency investment is ripe for scammers and thieves to exploit.

If your going to sell investments, such as the purchasing of bitcoin, then there should be a broker license. Just like with commodities. If bitcoin is going to make it to the big boy table,  it needs to start acting like it instead of it being susceptible to rampit market manipulation schemes and pump and dump fraud.
