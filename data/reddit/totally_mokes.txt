I think you just answered your own question - there are plenty of communication networks and data archives the internet didn't replace.
My understanding is that bitcoin was intended as a form of digital cash, i.e notes and coins, not a one-stop replacement for all of finance.

Windows seems designed to make malware easy sometimes, it's ridiculous. Try this in a command prompt on a windows box:
**mkdir test**
**cd test**
**echo visibledata &gt; test.txt**
**echo hiddendata &gt; test.txt:hidden**
Now try to find the data we just hid:
**Explorer .**
**more test.txt**
Not there? Try:
**more &lt; test.txt:hidden**
Welcome to the wonderful world of Alternative Data Streams, windows style.
To be fair they've been tightening up ADS somewhat since windows 7, but it's still nasty and exploitable.

I'm just an outsider looking in here, but you opened with "1000x increase in a couple of months" which was nonsense, and followed it up with an assertion that 13-&gt;1200 was "very close" to a thousandfold increase, when in reality it's not even a tenth of that.

Another way of looking at it is that the rapid ascent to over $1,000 last year gave us some insight into what widespread adoption will look like.

I bought in when bitcoin was $120 and people were convinced it would hit $1000 in the near future. 
Then it dropped to $80 and a huge amount of people declared it dead and mocked $1000 as a pipe dream. 
Then it went up to $1200.
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:27:39
I don't really care either way tbh, I think the guy who was arguing with you was pushing the point because you made a controversial opening statement **and fucked it up**, and rather than just say "oops my bad" you've been trying to bend reality to make it look like you weren't wrong since then.
Again, I'm just a passer-by, but from where I'm sitting it looks an awful lot like your original point was that it went up a thousand percent over a couple of months - which is a completely legitimate point btw, it actually rose by more than that - but you flubbed it and said 1000**x** (10,000%)
Since then it's all gone downhill. When challenged, you tried redefining the timescale so it would look more like 1000x (13-&gt;1200) but that's still nowhere near it, so now you're moving the start point again, from $13 back to $1. Which of course now fits your original claim, but the mental gymnastics you had to do to get there have left your original point a distant memory.
I think "oops, I meant percent" would have worked better than all this.

Here's a brief recap of where you went wrong:
**"1000x increases in a couple months aren't sustainable"** - your original claim, parameters defined as a thousandfold growth in a couple of months.
**"$13 to $1200? It's very close to 1000x"** - at this point the parameter changed from a couple of months, to the timespan between $13 and $1000
**"Did Bitcoin not start under $1 and grow to over $1000?"** - parameter changes again, from $13 to $1000, to $1 to $1000
So your starting point moved from September 2013 (a couple of months before $1200 - which would be a 1000% increase so is presumably what you meant originally, but were confused about multiplication and percentages) to maybe August 2012 ($13 - 10,000%, which you arbitrarily picked because you were now trying to back up the '1000x' narrative) and now it's all the way back to what, Feb 2011?
Yeah I'd call that mental gymnastics.

The bitcoin/dogecoin thing... Meh, I would have more of both.
On the topic of the PCs dominance though, if it was easy as getting your hardware on school desks, Acorn would still make computers (and it's a shame they don't if you ask me)
The PCs had multiple killer apps in the business software category, back then kids would rather have an Amiga or ST but their parents had to use PCs for work so they'd ended up in people's homes pretty much by osmosis. Acorn never made it out of the classroom in a meaningful way, and Commodore and Atari fared badly with their last generation of general purpose computers  - Atari was always a distant second for games and Commodore dropped the ball with the CD-32, a decidedly 2D console which was unfortunate to find itself running against the first playstation and Saturn a year or two after launch.
PCs were selling like hot-cakes at this point, they were modular, new hardware was coming out all the time, and when Doom came along it pretty much shut the lid on the whole PC vs Amiga: Gaming debate for good, not long after that we started seeing dedicated 3d hardware being made for the PC. 
People used Macs, but they were (like the Amiga) were primarily adopted for specialised tasks in specific subsets of the business world rather than just something everybody already had that did everything else you'd want to own a computer for (the PC)
I don't really have a point to make beyond that, just felt compelled to ramble on about what went down. It was fascinating watching it all happen. 
And I would totally have a modern day Amiga or Acorn computer - Amigas had a (2D) GPU before GPU was an acronym... Acorn's RiscPC let you just lob an x86 daughterboard into it alongside the existing CPU so you could run PC software on bare metal, no emulation necessary. 
God knows what kind of awesome computers we'd have today if history had played out a little differently. Once upon a time there was competition in the desktop market, and the PC was the worst of the bunch. Windows and DOS were awful too.
