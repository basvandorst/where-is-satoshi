Ok, how do we fix it? Those of us who actually make transactions with it are being killed by these fees.

This makes no sense. This isn't a loan, it's a temporary trade that heavily favors the one receiving the bitcoin. If I have $125,000 in BTC and I need $100,000 in cash, I would just sell the BTC and have money left over.
That paper seems to be written under the assumption that BTC is either staying steady or going down compared to USD, which couldn't be more faulty given the current market. 
The way the market is going, the one receiving the BTC should be the one paying interest, not the other way around.

3125 what the fuck
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:10:00
Ah, I misunderstood that part. But still, it's troubling that the paper specifically addresses the hypothetical of bitcoin depreciation, in which case the borrower must deposit more bitcoin to meet the collateral, but it does not address the case of bitcoin appreciation. So what it implies is that if BTC goes down, borrower gets fucked and has to deposit more, but if BTC goes up, borrower gets no benefit and lender has no obligation.
The whole thing is *far* too lender-friendly and just doesn't seem like a good deal for the borrower.

50 qubits is not nearly enough to threaten modern encryption.

It's not a threat to sha256, but it will eventually break the elliptic curve cryptographic algorithm that secures private keys.

Boot off a live disk, disable all network access, use an offline key generator, write down the public and private keys. Reboot into your main OS before turning on network access again.

"Quantum resistant" or "quantum safe" means that the use of a quantum computer provides no advantage to breaking an encryption over a classical computer. Currently there is no known algorithm, quantum or otherwise, that can generate collisions in the SHA256 hashing algorithm.
If someone managed to break SHA256 in such a way that they could hash an input specifically designed to get a certain output (e.g. with a certain number of leading zeros), then yes, they could easily mine all the remaining bitcoins as fast as the blockchain could update. However, according to our current knowledge of quantum computing, no such method exists.
On the other hand, the elliptic curve cryptography used to secure wallets is easily broken by the use of [Shor's algorithm]( This is due to a quantum computer's ability to "calculate" the modular order of multiple numbers simultaneously, limited by the number of qubits it has. Current quantum computers don't have nearly enough qubits to do any real damage, and it is possible that due to the way quantum noise scales with the number of qubits that they never will. But since it is *theoretically* possible on paper, this is definitely cause for concern.
@_date: 2019-06-25 08:22:38
It's not like a quantum computer is just a classical computer on mega steroids. We only know of a few potential practical purposes for a sufficiently advanced quantum computer.
Additionally, the mining algorithm works by searching for partial collisions in the SHA256 hashing algorithm, which is believed to be quantum-resistant. It's completely separate from the public-key cryptographic method used to secure wallets which would be compromised.

So true. Anyone I try to convince to check it out tells me that they "don't trust" or are "scared" of it. The most informed people about how the tech works seem to also be the ones who believe in it the most.

$50 btc says it happens tomorrow. Any takers?
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:04:00
I'm inclined to agree. We've had a doubling since July. It's clearly going through a period of exponential growth. Whether that continues is a valid question, but whether that has been the case up to this point is patently unquestionable.

Nah. I love the memes and the lighthearted feel here. I'll take this over a heavily-moderated bitcoin sub any day.
There are also plenty of in-depth articles and discussions in addition to the jokes. If you don't see them, you're not looking.
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:03:52
Well if you're living off your bitcoin investments, the amount of BTC you hold will always be going down, even if the value goes up. I'd rather HODL and keep that number going up.
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:25:32
This is why altcoins are a great thing. Bitcoin wasn't designed to be be a fluid spending currency, it was designed to be a digital gold. A solid, trustworthy, long-term store of value. The existence of alternative coins gives us options on case we need something more useful for daily transactions.

There are microtransactions for emoticons and such. I honestly don't mind because it's better than having a platform littered with ads.

Oh I'm the opposite. I have so many hobbies and things that I want to do, but my job is getting in the way of them. I'm looking to switch to something part-time or freelancing to cover my expenses for now. But there is a point that BTC could cross where money just wouldn't be a concern anymore. That honestly could be the end of this year if the current rate of growth continues.
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:00:01
Yup. I could cash out now having gained several thousand dollars, but the possibility that it will eventually be tens, and later hundreds of thousands is too real to even consider it.
If it dips, who cares, I'll buy more for cheap. But I really don't see this going to zero any time in the next few years. Quite the opposite.

No it's Coca-Cola lobbying the government to shut down Pepsi, in direct opposition to public interest. They're not looking to win market share in fair competition, they want to change the rules in a palpably unfair way.

That seems like a popular opinion around here. I just signed up, and it seems like a great service. My only objection so far is that once you deposit funds to your card, those funds are stored in USD instead of BTC. But that can be a non-issue by just never storing large amounts on the card.
All my BTC on the BitPay app are stored in BTC securely on my phone. Can someone please explain to me what the big problem is with them?
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:57:54
Thanks for the tip! I'll check it out.

I don't think anyone was seriously suggesting that. The other person who responded to me made a sarcastic comment that went over my head, but I'm pretty sure we're all on the same page here.

I think it's fair to assume we have at least one big dip coming at some point. But it could be from 20k to 15k for all we know, so I still think buying now is the most rational thing to do.

That doesn't work very well in developed countries. Trump's approval rating is not exactly stellar, so why don't the people rise up against him?
And Iran is far and away the most developed country in the Middle East, with the obvious exception of Israel.
