Your return is impressive, but those who held nearly doubled it in the last two weeks by standing pat. I'm sure your trading wisdom is ultra valuable to those in it to turn a quick profit, but maybe not as much with respect to the average bitcoin user. Most of them, those that aren't pure speculators, generally would have done much better by holding (regardless of when they got in). Are you sure your old lessons apply to this new technology?

You won't.

I see. Thanks for the explanation.

I believe bitcoin to be a paradigm changer, so I'm going to do my best to hold as long as I can, unless some new information comes around that changes the analysis (e.g. quantum computing). I understand and appreciate your caution. But even if this is a bubble, it could have ways to go. Bubbles often surprise to the upside. Bitcoin has math and plenty of fundamentals behind it, and now it's getting more free publicity than ever. Also, Asics might make difficulty go way high, supporting a higher price. You already broke your rule and got out before your target. As someone in it to make a quick buck, that's cost you plenty. Perhaps be right and sit tight is the best analysis for most bitcoiners.

Pretty big swing in prices though. This Series 1 auction ends sooner and is nearly $800 cheaper as of this writing.

For multiple reasons, you may be my hero sir.

Jon Matonis is a bitcoin hero! Krugman is a fraud.

Thanks for this. Will do.

I wonder if all his wisdom applies to finite commodities. So far, he was right but did not sit tight.
