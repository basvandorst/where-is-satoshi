They clearly wanted to talk about it even though the OP mentioned it was getting downvoted until it was posted in at which point it became 3rd on the all time top scoring posts?

I wonder if it would be possible to set a minimum block size, with any block below that size needing to be padded. It would increase blockchain bloat slightly but would discourage miners from only including high transaction fees.

If they have tampered with the bitcoin wallet generation they could generate a wallet that they own and take your money that way.

The 1MB block limit can be lifted if it becomes a limiting factor.
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:19:38
Because a larger filesize takes longer to download so it propegates slower through the network and so there is a risk that a smaller block can propegate faster and be accepted before the bigger block.

If people knowledgeable about computers can manage that megabyte means both 1000 kilobytes and 1024 kilobytes, I'm sure they can manage to remeber that bit has two seperate meanings.

They don't track down shoe theives because the US commerce authority tells them to, they do it because stealing is a crime. You can be arrested for stealing [virtual items]( why is bitcoin suddenly in this magical land of free market where the police can't reach?


You seem to be reaching the limit.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:38:26
There is no lower limit, but how much you gain/lose on day trading will depend on how much you put in. Day trading is risky but if you want to do it then any amount of money you would be comfortable losing is a good start.

None of your suggestions would even register on anyone apart from radar, whether you like it or not destroying them was the most effective way to spread the message.

[Zerocoin]( will allow for completely anonymous transactions.
@_date: 2014-02-05 21:55:57
Visa handles over a million transactions in 10 minutes, assuming bitcoin is still around and relevant by the time all the bitcoins have been mined it wouldn't be crazy to think it would be processing similar or greater numbers.
$0.25*1million = $250,000 that should be a good enough motivation.

A joke that had no bearing on the topic at hand and so was completely pointless. Maybe you should pull that stick out of your brain.

It's [fraud]( So yes, it would be illegal.

Whether or not it was a deliberate attempt to brigade is irrelevant, the point is that the top post of for a significant period of time was a post upvoted by people from another community because it was about how their community was better than this one.

Pretty much, dogecoin is inflationary so it will never be fully mined but I think the rest are the same as bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:50:13


I can at least see places other than Reddit using it. If no one is using it outside of Reddit then where are all the transactions coming from? The doge tipbot accounts for around 1/20 of their transactions, what is making the rest?
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:42:55
If someone in handling lots and lots of *other peoples* money they should be up to date on flaws and how to not be susceptible to them. This bug was known for over a year, there was no excuse for them to not be aware of it.
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:04:10
Why would they include no transactions when they could just include transactions and collect the fees? The filesize would still be the same so the benefit of not including them would be gone.
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:12:42
Zerocoin doesn't try to be an alternative to bitcoin, its trying to give bitcoin a true decentralized tumbler. Try harder with your shitposting next time.

The article was talking about the internet, not netscape. You didn't even have to read it as it was in the title. Maybe you should try learning to read.

If I'm going to stick money into something I'd much rather see them treating it seriously than see them treating it as a joke.

Freedom to control your money != Freedom to let people rob you.
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:49:01
What other reason would they have? Sticking it to the man? But yeah the forking issue would be a problem.

Did you go through the verification process? It only needs your address if I remeber correctly and it doesn't even need proof of that.
I'm in the UK and I can deposit Euros in through SEPA.

I've heard this a lot but outside of Reddit where are people actually using dogecoin?
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:37:54
There are tons of things with no chargebacks, regulation or central authority. It doesn't mean that I can't report my shoes stolen because there is no central shoe authority.
@_date: 2014-02-04 23:07:38


The post was like that. All the dogecoin posts are about how much more friendly dogecoin is, or how much more charity they do ect. They don't say that they're better explicitly but they are hinting that is the better subreddit.
@_date: 2014-02-04 23:00:14


Except it was a post like that which sparked this whole thing. If you allow posts that are simply comparing bitcoin to altcoins expect lots more 'Why is so bad and so great?' posts that get brigaded to the top.
@_date: 2014-01-21 21:32:49


Which is silly because the article isn't comparing it to netscape.

The fee wouldn't be 1 mBTC it would be much lower.

But the thing is when you purchase a product you will normally be out of the door within 1 minute, they aren't going to force people to stand around and slow down the entire checkout. Unless a crypto could figure out a way to do instant confirmations they would use 0 confirmations for both bitcoin and dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:20:32
No, it wouldn't. Just follow the guidelines in the wiki if you want a free transaction, or just add a small fee.
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:21:42
Takes SEPA deposits.
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:30:46
Curious what problems you see with the idea. I'm not advocating that we increase the minimum to such a level that transaction fees are no longer necessary just to raise it so that even if a pool trys to get their blocks added faster by skipping transactions they still need to include a number that is reasonable.
As the transaction fees are currently only a small percentage of the block reward, as is intended at this point, pools are disadvantaged if they try and include more transactions. This should help lessen that disadvantage.

I must have been living under a rock, when was the internet over taken by literally everything else?
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:36:54
I'd say allowing news which is either unique or has a direct impact on bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:43:51
Then the sound of you dodging my rebuttal.
