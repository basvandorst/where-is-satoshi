I think it's worth pointing out that you don't "get your money back" so much as never lose it in the first place. With a credit card the liability lies with the issuer until your bill is paid. That fraudulent charge never sees your bank account in most cases, it is fixed long before your monthly statement.

You know, I hadn't really given this much thought before but if hardware wallets ever really "take off" (along with Bitcoin, obviously) it seems like there's some major potential for counterfeit devices to end up on the market that have some sort of backdoor. People accidentally buy counterfeit goods on Amazon all the time (not realizing that they're buying from a 3rd party). Man what a clusterfuck that could be.

So how would bitcoin have prevented a crisis brought on by unscrupulous lending practices? Would people no longer need to borrow money (whether it be bitcoin or dollars) to buy a house?

Worst case scenario (if this isn't fake) he isn't anywhere near 50% loss, assuming he still has it all. He could still sell what he has and probably get 3/4 of his money back into USD.

The two business are apples and oranges. I'm not sure how you can make a statement that you're replacing one with the other. It's like saying you're never going to by gas for your car again because you bought a new automatic icemaker.

Is there anything someone like me could do to help new users? Signing up on localbitcoin, perhaps? I remember what a pain it was at first with a new account on coinbase, having those low daily and weekly limits. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 15:13:37
I don't understand how this means less debt. I'll still need a house, a car, etc. I don't earn enough to just save for either so I'll be borrowing the funds, whether it be bitcoin, dollars, ruples, bottlecaps, whatever (and if nobody is buying things with credit it will seriously stifle the economy - not that this scenario would ever occur. As long as credit is offered people will use it).
I get the transparency part, though it only applies to a degree. How transparent is coinbase right *now*? It will only get more complicated.
Why would we not have 3rd parties handling money? Would nobody use a bank? I highly doubt that. People will still want to deposit their bitcoin, it's what they're accustomed to. Banks will offer this service and people will sign up. They'll still use debit cards, etc. 
And will people still invest in investment/retirement funds? Of course they will. What impact would bitcoin have on this? None, so far as I can see.

It's not nice to call people names. If I'm wrong, explain it. I don't think I am. Show me a flight that costs that little. 
I checked on Expedia for flights from Boston to France and I'm finding $2500 and up. Maybe you can snag a ticket for as low as $800 if you have the know how.. 
In any case I was approaching the concept as a *trip* to Europe costing $800 (a one way ticket isn't going to be very useful for someone looking for a way to have fun for a week), vs going to Burning Man.

The US Mint makes coins. That's all. Coins.
You're thinking of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. But they don't "control" anything. They just manufacture the paper currency. So really you're probably thinking of the Dept of Treasury? I don't know. Either way your flow rate equation isn't going to be very interesting if you don't even know the simplest basics.

Yeah, I know I couldn't have held out if I had been sitting on dozens or even hundreds. I have a buddy who is just mystified that not everyone that had 100+ didn't sell at ~$1000. I had to explain that if *he* had 100 BTC that he got essentially for free back when it was worthless, would have have held past $100? or even $10? Even at $10, that's a quick thousand bucks for something that could have just evaporated the next day. You had to have some cajones to stick around this long.

I can have zero paper money in my leather wallet, too. 
I thought bitcoin was supposed to be a currency, not a banking platform or ideology. These sort of talks about bitcoin changing the banking world always seem to try too wedge the currency concept into our financial system somehow. Do people think bitcoin replacing the dollar would somehow mean people wouldn't use banks, especially for mortgages, business loans, investment management, etc? If everyone started selling their houses for BTC, you'd still need to take out a mortgage for BTC if you didn't have a house's worth in your wallet. And who among us mortals would? 
People currently have the option of keeping all their cash in USD in a shoebox in the closet, and almost nobody does. They'd rather let the bank hold it. I don't see this changing with the potential widespread adoption of bitcoin.

That does not apply in this case. 
The post title is to exclaim that Alex Jones supports a controversial technology/currency. In this way, "appeal to authority" is being exercised to provide weight to Alex Jones' personal opinion (whether it be popular or unpopular). Discrediting him as an authority is a legitimate argument to make. 
If the post title were "Alex Jones demonstrates why bitcoin is good/bad" then the ad hominem fallacy would apply. 
tl;dr: The fallacy lies with the post, not the top comment calling Alex Jones an idiot.

There's a big difference between someone being wealthy, having "millions in cash", and the potential of having 1/10 of all the bitcoin were bitcoin to actually become mainstream worldwide. There's no telling what that would be worth, ten trillion dollars? 500 quadrillion dollars? That's a level of wealth that is so far past abstract that it could possibly be disruptive to a global society.

When you have a data pool of over 300,000,000 people you can extrapolate any sort of statistics you want. How likely you are to be struck by lightning, for example. Doesn't mean it's "often".
I'm not saying it isn't a problem in certain cases. USA isn't perfect. Everyone knows that. But saying innocent people are "often" subject to that kind of shit is ridiculous. Living in the US you probably have as good a probability as anyone else on the planet of being born, living your life, and dying without ever being subject to violence or government oppression.
