Close, but no cigar. This is the conclusion I've come to:
When security is required, it is illogical to place any trust in any centralized organization of any kind regardless of where it is geographically located.

You have FAILED to address or even mention any of the specific issues I mentioned. Are you a politician, corporate exec or banker? Whatever, it doesn't even matter, you obviously don't care like the bulk of the electorate and both parties. 
Bitcoin is no savior, the blockchain protocol technology its based on is.

It's so cute you think TPTB care about this in regards to the population.

I'll work for either of your guys' companies if you need SEO, lol. No bullshit either, I know my stuff.

Maybe, but I honestly don't care at this point. I don't get paid in Bitcoin so it doesn't even apply to me. If it did or ever does at this point in my life I can barely convince myself to stay alive so I don't really give a fuck. Send a swat team and shoot me &amp; my dog.

It is illogical to do anything but act in a way that assumes the government considers you a threat, because they do. We are nothing but potential threats to be controlled and leveraged for power. Blockchain protocol is the real threat, it could potentially give rise to an anarchic worldwide society that solves problems based on consensus with NO leaders. Imagine, no politics, no political parties, no more Bushs' Clintons or Putins. Just human beings being prosperous and peaceful, worldwide. 
Yea, I know it won't happen either. We're all fucked.

You only get that 30% loss if you sell. However, if your point is about the volatility making BTC a scary fucking thing to be paid in, I'd agree with your valid point. 
The point I'm making is only fools or the ignorant accept the currency situation of the USD with no problem. The Federal Reserve is a private central bank. Quantitative Easing is a fucking absurd, useless, inflationary load of bullshit. Fractional reserve banking is tyrannically evil.  These practices are constantly being used all while the CPI keeps climbing. This compounds the problem where your dollar buy less than it did a 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 years ago. Doing this kind of stuff, politicians sell the myth of unending economic growth for all and promote a fake form of free market capitalism while maintaining the power, influence and wealth for themselves and their corporate owners. See, you &amp; I? Fucked.
And all political leaders want it this way. The population is sold out &amp; fucked all the while convinced its for their own good. Equal blame is laid upon the "leaders" of our society and those that voted them there. Notice how these issues are never on the lips of politicians of either party.

Um, the USD buys 93% LESS than it once did.

Since our overlords have declared Bitcoin as property, you only have to declare capital gains and losses for your taxes. Therefore If I'm ever making my entire income in bitcoin, I'll never transfer it back into USD if I can help it. That will make taxes easy to do, and will keep as much of my money with me and as little as possible going to that worthless cunt Uncle Sam. It'd be nice to starve to death the tyrannical whore that is the US Government &amp; the private bankers that own them, but I know that's a pipe dream.
