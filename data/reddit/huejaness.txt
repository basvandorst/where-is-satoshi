Is there away to lower these fees? I read there is a different way to buy and transfer with a lower fee. I believe it had to do with your payment choice?

Ok so I decided on Electrum and transferred most into it. At the moment its says pending. Is this something I wait for or do I have to do something?

Well it says bitcoin went up 26 bucks yet it says my bitcoin lost roughly 5$. Does holding your bitcoin in a wallet loose its value. I'm kinda a noob.
