@_date: 2012-10-22 22:57:35
there are many, many bitcoin gambling websites!
@_date: 2012-10-05 20:55:51
yeah i'm still in shock over glbse.  ignore me.

@_date: 2012-10-17 16:56:12
To every legit bitcoin user, there are 10 people who are trying to scam legit businesses out of money.  This is one of the reasons they need to verify each user.
@_date: 2012-09-24 16:19:23
what does this mean for other GLBSE assets?
@_date: 2012-10-05 20:18:51
GLBSE dead, and BFL a scam?  Bitcoin's reputation went from 99% scams to 100%. 
we're toast.
@_date: 2012-09-08 19:25:57
yeah making the claim of having a dream money making machine botnet sounds too good to be true, and offering to sell it to random people is surely a scam.
@_date: 2012-09-08 23:16:54
my thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2012-09-24 18:51:48
everyone should leave comments of fury on that submission!
@_date: 2012-07-11 03:53:26
@_date: 2012-10-22 21:23:12
be sure to also check out the complete list of gambling sites! :D

send a 30 BTC fee to 1KPtu8sEMHG5q6ZPw5sRDNPL8ciRp6EaRv and I will show you.
@_date: 2012-09-09 02:50:06
lol top news today is someone going to jail over a botnet
i guess that answers the question as to if it's right or wrong to do this
@_date: 2012-07-11 04:39:49
now someone has to put up a wallet with 0.01 and see if someone takes it!
@_date: 2012-10-18 16:18:07
master list.. but the complete list is here:

the jalapeno is a carrot, and we are the horses.
they always seem to get further away.
@_date: 2012-11-28 23:42:51
I'm more concerned that they mention MT.GOX founders starting it up.
SHAME ON YOU for creating a bitcoin-clone and still controlling 80% of trades.
@_date: 2012-07-10 01:20:27
you should.  in a year, you might be able to buy two houses and send your kids to harvard on the same investment! 
or you could lose it all, but you won't gain without taking the risk.
@_date: 2012-11-28 23:46:35
(unless i totally dont understand the motive or the project at all, i judged it in less than 5 seconds)

@_date: 2012-09-24 18:50:50
As if it wouldn't make the top ten, having more votes than any other submission!!!!!
@_date: 2012-11-26 21:20:32
oh hell yea.  I can get 250 LTC per day worth $0.065 or so, worth like $16.25, whereas I might not even get a full bitcoin, so I am making more this way, plus if the whole world realizes this, the litecoin difficulty could go up dramatically and these $16.25 days could turn into $162.50 days...
@_date: 2012-11-12 18:16:19
I would DEFINITELY.  
@_date: 2012-07-09 05:42:40
i've been trying to catch it to record on my PVR and i finally got the chance today, w00t!
@_date: 2012-07-06 03:39:49
played it for about half an hour.  pretty nifty game, i like the interface and I haven't run into any technical problems, but the game is a bit dated.  do you think this would work on a smartphone?  it would probably get a ton of usage as an app.  
if there was a lot more people playing it, it would probably be a little bit more interesting.  i don't really think it's worth the price, though, but i'll keep playing it and see if it gets fun later.
@_date: 2012-09-24 22:29:32
that wasn't two days before the end.  towards the end it had over 200 votes.  or maybe it was, im not really positive.
@_date: 2012-11-22 18:09:31
watch Litecoin for increased hashrate :D
@_date: 2012-11-26 17:11:36
well okay, since litecoin was made so you can mine LTC on your CPU and BTC on your GPU, and now that you can mine LTC on your GPU it seems kind of pointless, right?
well fast forward 2 weeks from now when the BFL devices are here adding hundreds of TH/s's to the Bitcoin network, and fast forward 2 days from now when the Bitcoin block reward halves, are you really going to be mining Bitcoin on your GPU anymore?
Consider Litecoin the only way to profitably mine on a Radeon for the next few years.  In fact it's more profitable to be mining it at the moment, and if you think of the thousands of Radeons out there which will soon be turned off or sold, the remainder of miners have to point at Litecoin or stop altogether, unless a bitcoin is trading for over $50.

What about the calculators on clarkmoody?
Click the 'show calculators' button, then type in 'buy $1,000,000' and it will calculate the estimated slippage of the transaction.  
@_date: 2012-11-12 18:04:27
another delay?  lmao
@_date: 2012-07-06 01:43:50
omg yes!
