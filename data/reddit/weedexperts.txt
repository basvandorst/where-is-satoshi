So you want to pretend to someone that you own 10 BTC? And are willing to pay $1k to do that? Sounds like easy money.

You only tried drugs a few times then?
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:32:57
You should maybe explain more what you intend on doing so people have more confidence in what you are trying to do?
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:41:08
LOL. How does this even make sense in your brain?
Microsoft will store all their bitcoin and never use it but destroy it to hurt bitcoin??? So they will effectively lose money to try and destroy bitcoin? Are you high?

Zipfs law is exactly about word frequency in languages. It's interesting because it's been studied across multiple languages and seems to hold true.
Yes similiar things are seen across various other areas, commonly described as a power law, but they also have nothing to do with Bitcoin or eachother in most cases.
Most of these things are mostly unrelated and the only connection is that the data appears to follow a line on a log log scale and someone is saying OH IT'S ZIPFS LAW AGAIN. No it's not. It's just a fucking line on a graph that looks like another line on a graph.

It's not a wallet. You can't do anything with the bitcoin but convert it back into fiat.
It's ok if you want to buy a bit but you can't withdraw it yet.

This is exactly what you said:


So stop trying to worm out of it. Those were your words. You are telling people to sell now and buy in the dip.
Now you are making up excuses. Admit you were wrong and move on. The end.

Buy the dip mother fucker buy the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:05:49
Then you should contact the exchanges and see if they are offering such a service. I suspect not as it would mean a 2 tier system.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:38:28


Actually it does, and they read your comments and think oh look everyone is saying buy the dip.
You cannot predict when it will dip, for how long it will dip, nor can you be ready 24x7 to sit and watch waiting for it to happen. It's a fools game.


Because I don't want people to keep losing their money reading dumb comments from people who think they can predict the markets.

Bitcoin is strongly consistent as long as you allow for X number of transaction confirmations, that is a fundamental rule which which avoids the double spend risk.
In that case Bitcoin does not need immediate consistency. 
These are interesting concepts when designing and selecting technologies for a distributed system, but they don't describe a flaw or potential problem for bitcoin as those are mitigated as part of the bitcoin protocol. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:47:01
Slowly. Spread out over multiple exchanges and done in batches to reduce your risk.
That or find someone willing to do a direct trade.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:06:05
This is a lot of fud. 
There are plenty of clean energy sources for bitcoin mining. Solar, wind and hydro. The fact the global network uses more electricity than a country is not surprising nor should it worry you.

Yeah.... it always is because they don't want to lose money so they build in a small buffer.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:53:16
Firstly fees will cost you if you constantly cash out at minimums, secondly are you constantly checking to make sure they for example don't change you cash out address. 
Trusting some company that just got "hacked" and lost 65m in mining profits is stupid. 
Or you could you know use slushpool who are orders or magnitude more reliable and trust worthy.

Before you start worrying about something you need to put it into perspective. Bitcoin electrical consumption is not that much in comparison.
It's only idiots who say OMG IT TAKES 300 KWH to process a transaction. Yeah now tell me how much it takes for me to drive to work every day, how much air travel takes, global shipping costs, manufacturing costs, all the rare earth minerals we pull out of the ground to manufacturer our phones for example.


It's not inefficient, it's been designed this way because proof of work is the foundation of Bitcoin. As long as miners are incentivised to run the network it will continue to grow.
When Bitcoin had 10 nodes it could still process the same number of transactions, generating the same number of blocks every 10 minutes. Now that there are hundreds of thousands of miners trying to get a slice they are all fighting for the same block reward every 10 minutes.
All we have to do is stick a bunch of asic's with a shit ton of solar panels and the problem is solved. It's really not that difficult.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:20:34

@_date: 2017-12-07 10:18:00
Idiots have been saying the same thing since 10k. They've been losing out ever since.
And then you have idiots who sell as soon as they see a few red candles in a panic only for the price to shoot back up so they buy back in because they don't want to miss out. And then they repeat until their BTC gets smaller and smaller.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:22:20
Last time I paid that low a fee it took about 11 days. It might take longer now.

Most of these fuckwits are extremely naive in the world of business.
Why I'm so cynical? My wife has experience in the health and nutrition space and it's extremely difficult to survive. Every day people are starting up new businesses and 90% of them are failing.
If you want to know what business she started:

Assuming that doing it the way we've always done is the way it should always be done?
I'm not saying it's a flaw, just that I can see bad ways of doing it and good ways of doing it because we can all agree that implementing say delays into an API for a "free tier" and then charging for high speed access would be a bad thing right?

Have you considered the energy footprint of for example the global electronics industry? The footprint of our constant obsession with new smartphones? The global footprint of shipping all that shite from China? What about all air travel? Meat production? Cars?
All of these things are orders of magnitude bigger problems than Bitcoin electricity usage but now all of the sudden people are talking about Bitcoin as the new bogeyman.
And quite frankly, we already have solar panels which are efficient and cheap enough to power mining farms, so the problem has already been solved.
The Carbon Offset industry is huge and people are making massive profits. So yeah, you are just trying to guilt people into making others richer.

The only thing that reduces difficulty is the hash power decreasing. That only happens if miners decide it's not profitable to mine. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:05:07
Why is that a problem? The point of LN is not to solve all problems but rather to solve some of the problems. 
Every exchange and big bitcoin institution will be running an LN node. That's going to take a huge load off the main network. 
There are other things being worked on which will increase the number of transactions per block even further.
These are complex issues with no easy answers. We need time to develop them.

You already worked it out. LN doesn't work if all you do is open and close a channel for each transaction.


Exactly. The idea is to have a large network established such that you can open a channel to one of the nodes and route your payment through to its eventual destination.

Miners are invested into Bitcoin more than anyone, they won't just stop mining.
There may be some drop off in hash power, some may move to other coins or stop alltogether but many will continue. The difficulty will adjust. The Bitcoin network will continue.

Who/where/what are you talking about? Most people here strongly advise against investing life savings into Bitcoin.


Again... who/where/what are you even talking about? Bitcoin has generally done much better than 10%, 
however 10% is still a very respectable number, most investors globally would be very happy with 10%.
You seem to be the kind of idiot who doesn't understand that earning 10% on your investment is a good thing and not a negative.

The Coinbase current price lags behind the actual current price and the actual current price is extremely volatile anyway so you may see some interesting swings in Coinbase if you want to buy directly. (Yesterday I was seeing a £600 difference)
If you want to buy at the spot price (the actual current market price) then you need to use an Exchange, otherwise don't worry too much if it's around 3% difference, these are the kind of swings Bitcoin goes through sometimes within 5-10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:08:21

Great so you pay more and get faster access? Sounds like a bad deal for people without big wallets.
Direct API access should be available for everyone. If you want to put servers close by that's fine but it should be open for everyone in that respect.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:21:09


lol? are you 5? crybabe? what?
Anyway.... The point I was making is that any kind of two tier access should be open for everyone. I'm not saying that everyone has to have a level playing field with a fixed latency.
I have no problem if they opened up direct API access, as I could then be free to host a server as close as possible for example.
If they instead charge people some fee to join a private club to get access meanwhilst everyone else has to go over some cloudflare rubbish well that's a bad 2 tier system.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:09:55

Yes it's quite a lot when you break it down into "per transaction" but in the grand scheme of things, it's not a huge amount. We just don't get told how much energy it takes to use everyday things because they are very hard to calculate. Bitcoin by comparison is relatively easy with some reasonably strong assumptions.
The average American car for example need about 35000kwh to build according to a few estimates I've seen online.
Then consider air travel, vehicles, the cost to produce food. These are huge in comparison.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:37:24
Availability in this case simply means:


Which is to say, we can guarantee a response, we just can't guarantee it's correct. Waiting for confirmations removes this problem.


Bitcoin does continue to operate despite the fact the internet is constantly dropping/delaying things. The proof of work is very resilient and the network regulates itself.

The same is true for every currency. The more mature and widespread a currency is used, generally the less volatility.
Nobody is ignoring it. You just don't understand it. Most retailers who rely upon FIAT for their stock will convert Bitcoin into FIAT at the point of purchase, thereby removing the risk of volatility from their transaction.

You guys have to realise that there are traders out there many times more experienced with huge balances who are actively trying to shake out all the weak hands. 
This is the kind of volatility they crave because it means they can grab cheap coins from those that are too scared to hold. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:37:58

I'm not a fucking mind reader. If you bring up the fact that Bitcoin fee's are higher than traditional banking then that's the fucking point i'm gonna go with, not the fucking hidden point which you failed to mention.


Maybe but it's not simply technology which makes a coin valuable, it's the ecosystem around it and the level of adoption. Bitcoin has a huge ecosystem and far greater levels of adoption than anything else currently. Until that changes Bitcoin will continue to lead the way. I think there will be some useful alt coins, Bitcoin won't be the only one, but it will be the most valuable and the one which everything else will be eventually pegged to.

Your paper wallet should have two keys. A public key and a private key.

It's actually much harder to extort large amount of fiat from someone. You can't say drive to the bank and take out 2m or send it via online banking, they all have limits and controls.
Bitcoin does make it easier. This is why I think holders of very large amounts will eventually use custodial services which would make it impossible for a compromised individual to be forced to send all their wealth against their will. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:19:06
Liquidity of FIAT is rubbish so you need to hold large amounts of BTC/FIAT in multiple exchanges/currencies and Bitcoin exchanges are still too risky for big market makers to hold large quantities of FIAT/BTC.
So whilst arbitrage does happen, it's extremely minimal and limited to hobby day traders making peanuts.

Imo the premium for the physical item will not scale with the price of BTC. So if you were looking to invest you should just buy bitcoin and you will have an asset you can actually use.

Think about this. You've made a decision that you are willing to invest in bitcoin and have come up with a figure that you deem acceptable. What is the problem? Why are you worried? I have been investing 10% of my income into Bitcoin because that's my figure on what I am willing to lose. I am not going above that. So I have nothing to fear and I will continue to hold through the big dips and continue to buy through the ATHS.

I don't need to put on an image for others.
That doesn't mean I don't appreciate the finer things in life.
The upside to this is that I can go anywhere and talk to anyone. People don't just assume I'm some dick head. I'd rather be one of the people.

It's also bad opsec to throw it around on a public forum. If you want to take donations publish a separate receive address.

You could start by first hiring an engineering team who had a basic understanding of intergalactic engine design instead of your local car mechanic.

Definitely however given confirmation times currently i don't see it happening any time soon. 
Amazon will want a smooth and quick payment. Something like lightning would be ideal but that's some way off.

I think all the idiots that post this shit somehow think they will convince more people to invest.

What a load off rubbish.

The fact you purchased bitcoin means you increased the value by some small miniscule amount.
Telling us about it is pointless and frankly nobody cares.
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:14:19
This is so tiresome.
Stop trying to second guess the market. Invest for the long term. Consider the next 1-3-5 years.

Total waste of time unless you have free electricity and even then the ROI is a long time. At this rate buying and holding is more profitable.

Bitpay for example. There are many bitcoin payment providers that have APIs you can integrate.

My understanding is that no Bitcoin is actually traded or purchased, so I don't see how a futures market will have much impact on the Bitcoin price?
Rather every short position must be backed by a long position, so people are essentially betting against each other on the future value.

I will not be insulted. I am a millionaire and you are worth nothing.

Your comment has no relevance to anything I said.

Yeah as long as you store the seed and then transmit it to your database for safe keeping so that when I save enough bitcoin you can take it away and keep it safe.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:30:14
P.s if you do have the bitcoin I would suggest sweeping it into a different wallet to make sure the seller didn't save the private keys and steal your bitcoin.

It's always a bad time.

You have zero knowledge of a correction. Trying to guess the market is a fools game. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:27:51
Then you don't understand the fundamentals of what makes bitcoin valuable. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:56:58
It's gonna be nearer 20k before we see any kind of major major correction. Then it will stabilise around 10k.

So you only run this in winter then? LOL. What a load of rubbish.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:15:00
That's fine but do not store your coins in an online wallet. I use Blockchain.com for a small amount of bitcoin for convenience, the rest I keep in a secure offline wallet.
It's great for convenience but consider if the price goes 10-20x in the next 5-10 years. Do you trust bitcoin.com?

Many places block VPNs as they associated with dodgy activity. It's sad but it means genuine users also have their privacy compromised.

I'm not advocating for buggy code, however there is a broad spectrum of development which could be considered imperfect by overly critical people which still works perfectly well for the task at hand. It may be inefficient for example but it might be efficient enough for real world use. 
There is a huge gap between the theoretical and the practical. 
Those that are unwilling to compromise on perfection can become a liability. The best developers in the world know this and understand that perfection isn't the goal, the goal is to deliver something that works. That doesn't mean you shit out the first working prototype, the definition of works depends on what you are building. If you are building an app or a store if wealth for billions the definition is totally different. But let's not pretend that bitcoin needs perfection.

A financial advisor is not going to have anything positive to say about Bitcoin.
Have a look at what Time Draper has been saying about Bitcoin.

Bitoin is not a company. It's not Blockbuster, it's not Nokia, it's absolutely nothing compared to these things. I truly believe that Bitcoin is a paradigm shift, it's internet money for an interconnected world. Any comparisons to the past completely underestimate what Bitcoin is. It's going to change the way we think of money the way the Internet changed the way we think about EVERYTHING.


That's a risk but I think a small one. Bitcoin has proven itself now, your argument might have been worth thinking about 5 years ago now but that time has past. Bitcoin was first and it will not be dethroned as the number one cryptocurrency in the world. People will try and convince you that their currency is more valuable and some may well be worth investing in and have real world value but it will not be taken away from Bitcoin.
The fear quote you are thinking of is probably this one, from Dune:

So you are saying it's ok to print money to grow an economy? Shame it's only the top 0.1% who actually get rich off the backs of everyone else's labour.

Pretty sure 100% of investment includes hoping the value goes up.
