What about this [comment from sep 8 2014]( (few months after his "I am not Dorian Nakamoto" message):




Looks like his P2P foundation account was compromised as well.

I'll try a ELI16 (and have some Bitcoin background). 
First, some recap on Bitcoin transactions:
- Bitcoin transactions are made of inputs and outputs. 
- An output contains a "challenge" script (commonly known as scriptPubKey) and an amount. 
- An input references an output (tx hash, index) and has a "solution" script (commonly known as scriptSig) which solves the "challenge" of that output. Typically, this is just some data which makes the "challenge" script evaluate to true.
- An output can only be spent by an input which correctly solves its "challenge".
- There are multiple [types of challenges]( The most common one is called "pay-to-pubkeyhash" and is what Bitcoin clients put in outputs when sending to Bitcoin addresses which start with "1".
- A "pay-to-pubkeyhash" challenge is solved by a "solution" script which supplies the correct public key and signature.
- Note: challenge/solution are not standard terminology. They are called scriptPubKey/scriptSig in the real world.
The insight behind "segregated witness" is that "solution" scripts in inputs end up taking a lot of space in blocks but could be transmitted separately, permitting more transactions to fit in 1MB blocks. That sounds like a tautology (hell, why not take out more stuff as well) but what makes "segregated witness" interesting is that this would be possible to achieve without a hard fork (that is, older bitcoin clients would keep working fine even if they are running an older version of Bitcoin). 
"Segregated witness" outputs would use a new type of "challenge" script which only consists of data (a version number and a serialised "challenge" script). Those "challenge" scripts would be considered solvable by anyone according to old Bitcoin clients but new rules would be introduced to define what "solves" them. Without getting into details, those new rules would involve obtaining the "solution" script (aka "witness data") separately and making sure it solves the serialised "challenge" script. 
As soon as a majority of miners have upgraded to this newer bitcoin version, only transactions which obey the new rules will make it into the blockchain and people can start using this new type of output without risking them being spendable by everyone.
As an added bonus, transactions spending those new types of outputs won't have any signature in them solving the infamous transaction malleability issues.

I believe the "I am not Dorian Nakamoto" message might have been genuinely from him but he is definitely no longer in control of that account now.

No one knows. There are only theories at this point.
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:21:17
1) Read [Satoshi's paper]( 
If you don't understand some concepts such as [hash functions]( [public key cryptography]( or [binary numbers]( read the related Wikipedia articles and if that isn't enough, read a book about cryptography. For your purpose, you don't need to know the low level details of P2P networks. Once, you have a good grasp of the cryptographic concepts, go back to reading the paper. 
2) Read the [technical articles]( on the [Bitcoin wiki]( Some important concepts: the [block chain]( [transactions]( [proof of work]( Read the articles on [contracts]( and [smart property]( for examples of innovative uses of the block chain.
3) Get creative :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:08:39


No. Since the two blockchains are identical up to the point where they diverge, any amount of Bitcoin you had before the fork will be reflected in both chains. No need to panic. However, if you want to receive payments *after* the fork, you have to specify whether you accept payments in OldCoins or NewCoins. 


It's up to the end users, not the miners. Miners will most likely move to whichever currency is more widely used. It happened once due to a bug in a newer version of the client and people who had downloaded the buggy client agreed to move back to the non buggy client (I assume they realized that their "new" currency would never catch on).

Hey, olalonde from  here. Thanks for doing this! Any chance you could support a timestamp parameter? (e.g. display the balance for a given point in time) This is needed for me to complete the proof-of-solvency extension (because proof of liabilities are only valid for a given point in time).

Visualization available here: 
tl;dr: The site produces a merkle tree of all accounts on the site. The site publishes the root publicly and the path of each users in the tree privately. Users compute the root from their private tree and see if it matches the published root. This can all be automated through a verification tool.

You should mention some of the "never possible before" innovations that Bitcoin enables ([proof of solvency]( smart contracts, smart property or m-of-n payments for example).

I see your point but it doesn't make sense to compare Bitcoin to the dot com bubble at this point. From Wikipedia: "America's 371 publicly traded Internet companies have grown to the point that they are collectively valued at $1.3 trillion, which amounts to about 8% of the entire U.S. stock market". Bitcoin's price would have to climb to 100,000$+ to be comparable in magnitude.

Yes, I think this is the strongest argument against this man being Satoshi. That being said, a lot of people use their real name and still use PGP (PGP is for privacy, not necessarily anonymity). He could have used Tor just to mask his IP address. It's also possible that he never expected Bitcoin to become huge and becoming anonymous was an afterthought. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 09:06:21

@_date: 2014-02-10 12:16:45
Yep, exactly. I believe a solution MtGox could implement would be to monitor the inputs used in the transaction instead of monitoring the transaction ID. If in the blockchain they see the inputs were spent, it must mean their transaction got confirmed. It is far from a fatal flaw to the Bitcoin protocol and doesn't affect regular wallets such as Bitcoin-qt.
@_date: 2014-04-24 11:33:57


I think a few people in this thread misunderstood the whole "you don't own bitcoins unless you own the private key" mantra. It is meant to be pragmatic advice rather than legal fact. It's pragmatic advice because giving up control of your bitcoin is risky and puts you at the mercy of a third party's integrity and competence. It's not legal fact because the law does allow for giving up control of property without giving up ownership (as pointed out by someone else). Otherwise, you couldn't own any files uploaded to Dropbox or any data hosted on a virtual/dedicated server for example.

I think it would be possible in theory to reverse the transaction by making a new transaction which spends the same inputs and has a higher transaction fee. That being said, I don't think there is currently any client which implements this feature.
@_date: 2014-01-13 11:43:35
Not really a problem as people don't update their software that often and there are now multiple client implementations so a problem with the canonical client would get noticed very quickly.
@_date: 2014-04-27 12:32:38


Except I wrote a Bitcoin client, contribute to Bitcore, operate a few VPN servers and live in China...
If you read carefully, I never claimed China will/could block VPNs. I simply said that it could block Bitcoin in the same way they block Tor/Facebook/Youtube (that is, not really blocked *if* you have access to a VPN and know how to use it - most VPN providers are blocked in China). It would definitely make using Bitcoin in China a PITA.

Ah, you are right. But what distinction do you make between money and currency? Is there a legal distinction between both terms?

(Some general thoughts)
I think this community would do well to follow the old saying about picking battles. I understand that the end goal for many Bitcoiners (myself included) is to promote liberty ideals but I think it would be wiser to fight one battle at a time. Pragmatically, Bitcoin has a better shot at going mainstream in the next few years than a radical change in politics and I believe it would be more productive for us to leave ideology at the door until then. If Circle expands Bitcoin's user base (users who likely wouldn't have used Bitcoin at all in the first place), more power to them.

I'm sorry but I have very little empathy for people who fall for altcoins. Unless your altcoin introduces some radically new concepts (on the order of how different Bitcoin was from existing currencies at its inception), your altcoin is a get-rich-quick scheme and if it doesn't die from a 51% attack, it will die from a lack of network effect / utility. Zerocoin and Ethereum might qualify as such altcoins (although I admit I haven't paid attention to them much). Pardon my brutal honesty.

Some key points:
- Bitcoin is not a currency (in the legal way). It might get its own legal category.
- Government agencies seem mostly interested in regulating Bitcoin at the exchange level.
- They all seemed to recognize the technological innovation behind Bitcoin and its importance.
- Gonzague Grandval (Paymium president) did a pretty good job at describing and defending Bitcoin.

I would say that's one of its primary purposes although not its "entire purpose". Another purpose would be that it has a fixed and predictable money supply. Another one would be that it can be transferred almost instantly anywhere in the world. Another one would be that it can be used mostly anonymously. My point is that people find Bitcoin appealing for diverse reasons and we shouldn't look down upon those who don't necessarily embrace all of them.

First, This sentence doesn't make sense. There is absolutely no "network effect" that search engines gain from (except for the size of the web which all search engines gain equally from). In fact, if anything, the  "network effect" you are referring to (user adoption) **harms** search engines to a certain degree[0]. 
You are comparing apples with oranges here.
Second, there is virtually no cost associated with switching over from one search engine to another (you just need to get used to the UI). The Pagerank algorithm was a significant enough improvement over alternatives for users to switch given the tiny cost of switching. Switching from a product/service that does benefit from the "network effect" carries a much higher cost (e.g. switching from Facebook to UnknownSocialNetwork, switching from TCP/IP to XXX/YY, switching from USD to UnknownCurrency).
Third, my argument is based on the premise that those altcoins are indeed superior to Bitcoin (which is clearly debatable). If they are indeed superior but only slightly my argument still stands.
The only altcoins I will pay attention to are those that claim to be drastically superior to / different from Bitcoin.
PS: Ethereum/zerocoin might fall into that category.

The number of "zero"s at the beginning of hashes is just a dumbed down explanation for how actual mining works. 
Miners actually have to find a hash that is smaller then a given number (the target). The smaller that target is, the more it will have leading zeroes but it is still possible for one target to be smaller then another while having the same amount of leading zeroes. For example, 00100 (4) is smaller than 00110 (6) in binary but they both start with the same amount of 0s.

I think I may have a technical solution but I'm not sure it would work. What if the size of blocks was taken into consideration when choosing which chain wins? For example, instead of blindly choosing the longest chain in terms of number of blocks mined, what if the winning chain would be the one with the most transactions? One problem I see is that it would create a perverse incentive for miners to always use up the full block limit (which would make the blockchain bigger).
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:36:33
If you are an exchange, this is how you would use this utility. Firs, save all your users in a JSON file with that format:
    [ { user: 'satoshi', balance: 3400 }, { user: 'olalonde', balance: 2 }, etc.... ]
Then run the following commands to get the root hash and value of the tree.
    $ ./cli.js privatetree -f test/accounts.json &gt; private.json
    $ ./cli.js root -f private.json --human
    Root hash: SLpDal8kYJNdLwczp6wrU68FOFrpoHT3w5nd15HOpwU=
    Root value: 37618
Publish those values on your website
Generate a unique tree for each users which they can download once logged in. For example for user satoshi:
    $ ./cli.js publictree satoshi -f private.json &gt; satoshi.json
Each user can now verify that they are included in the tree with this command:
    $ ./cli.js verify --hash SLpDal8kYJNdLwczp6wrU68FOFrpoHT3w5nd15HOpwU= --value 37618 -f satoshi.json
But as I said, this is just a proof of concept for now and the implementation is likely buggy. I will work on producing a stable and well tested version in the next few days.

I'm going to cross-post my comment here since it hasn't been approved (yet):
Hi Danny, are you aware of  It's an attempt at standardising the audit scheme (which I have co-authored with Isaac Wilcox and others - based on Gregory Maxwell's merkle tree approach) and serves two goals:
- Make it easy for exchanges to correctly implement the scheme by providing standardised and peer reviewed tools
- Make it easy for users to verify proofs by providing multiple independent verification tools. 
The problem with having a fragmented eco-system of non-standardised schemes is that non technical users have no way of verifying the soundness of schemes and have no "user friendly" tools to verify proofs.
Currently, there are 5 independent and open source implementations of the scheme and at least 2 exchanges have adopted it:  and  There is also this web app which makes it dead easy for end users to verify proofs:  I have also written a Chrome extension which aims to make the whole verification completely automatic and effortless, but it's still a work in progress:  
By the way, there were some (presumably) unintentional flaws in both Kraken and Bitfinex's solvency schemes which have been discussed on Bitcointalk.
For more details about the scheme: 
I hate having to do this kind of self-promotion but this issue is really important to me and I would hate to end up in a world where every exchange has their own proprietary scheme and no user bothering to do the verifications. Additionally, I won't hide the fact that I have put a lot of work into this and find it slightly frustrating to have my attempts at pushing for standardisation largely ignored by the exchanges and media.

There are a few technical mistakes which may or may not be relevant depending on your audience.


This should be:  ‘Mining’ is the term used for finding ~~a~~ Bitcoin.
A solved block rewards the miner with a "block reward". The block reward is currently 25 BTC and halves every ~4 years.


This is not very accurate as every miner solve a different block. As the number of miners increase, each individual miner is statistically less likely to be the first one to solve a block but if they do, they get the full block reward. 


That's also a bit inaccurate. Wallets are made of multiple addresses and while it is true that those addressed will be visible in the blockchain (if they ever received BTC), it is not possible to know conclusively which addresses belong to the same wallet.

tl;dr: The Bitcoin network cannot support 100M active users (without a hard fork which would increase the block limit among other things).
No, parent is incorrect. The network could only theoretically support one transaction per person per ~165 days, no matter the fee.
There is a max of 7 transactions / second. That's 604800 (7 * 60 * 60 * 24) transactions per day limit. 100M transactions would take ~165 days (100M/604800) to process. Transactions with higher fees would be processed faster but the fees would likely be enormous given that only 0.6% of those 100M people could get their transaction processed within the first day.

This would work but would require trust in a third party (whoever prints those scratch-off wallets).

The stock Bitcoin client doest not permanently record all transactions that it sees, only those that make it to the block chain.

Without those transactions, it's impossible to do the kind of analysis they did.

Totally agree. Those are really the biggest issues hindering mainstream Bitcoin adoption at the moment. I think for Bitcoin to go mainstream we will need:
- **Hardware wallets** (to prevent grandmas from getting hacked). Wallet loss could be prevented by having those hardware wallets producing "time locked" transactions to another wallet regularly which would enable people to recover their funds in the event of a loss. Wallets which run on general purpose computers will never offer a level of security acceptable for grandmas.
- The "confusing addresses" problem is also an issue but I believe it will be largely solved by the payment protocol. I can foresee a future where you never have to copy/paste or even see an address except in rare occasions. In the same way that grandmas can use the web without having a URL bar.
In other words, we still need a few years for Bitcoin to be ready for grandmas.

It becomes an ID only after the transaction is included in the blockchain and shouldn't be considered as such before that event. I believe the reason transaction malleability hasn't been addressed fully yet is that there is a risk of causing a blockchain fork (I'm not entirely sure though). This is an issue that only affects poorly implemented Bitcoin wallets such as the one MtGox was using and doesn't affect Bitcoin-qt or Electrum.

It's not really a glitch. Here's the TL;DR: if you broadcast a transaction, it is possible your transaction will get confirmed with a different hashid so it is not safe to track if a transaction was confirmed by monitoring its hashid. So it only affects exchanges who monitor transaction IDs and agree to refund Bitcoin balance in case they can't see the transaction ID in the blockchain.

Only "off chain" transactions would be possible without an Internet connection. Off chain transactions are transactions that are made through a trusted party but that are not published on the blockchain.
There could be for example a bank that prints "bitcoin" bills and guarantees that those bills are backed by Bitcoin. Anyone could redeem those bills for actual Bitcoins by going to that bank and exchanging. Or they could keep them and use them as money. This of course requires complete trust in the bank and trust that you are not given fake bills. It kind of defeats the purpose of Bitcoin although it does have some benefits such as not requiring electricity / an Internet connection.
SMS could also be used for off chain transactions. For example, a system like M-Pesa could be backed by Bitcoin instead of being backed by fiat currency.

Because those proofs are close to worthless (or even harmful) when they require users to have technical knowledge to evaluate / verify them. There exists a standard scheme for proving solvency that is equivalent to Coinfloor's scheme except it has a much higher degree of privacy (it doesn't reveal individual balances) and it already has a few user friendly and independent verification tools (e.g.  - disclosure: I wrote this one)[0].

People, this is "just" a scheduled hard fork that went bad (the developers made a backwards incompatible change to the protocol and a sizable part of the network forgot or refused to update).
While altcoins are more vulnerable to 51% attacks, 51% attacks do not result in hard forks. Hard forks can only happen when two or more incompatible clients are simultaneously used by the network participants.
51% attacks are easier to pull off during hard forks because the network's hashing rate is essentially split between the  chains but there is no evidence that such an attack has occurred.

I disagree. Journalists dismiss Bitcoin on another basis than Bitcoiners who dismiss altcoins. Here's my reason for dismissing most altcoins (on the basis of how radically better/different they are from previous technologies):
Fiat -------------------- ( large gap ) -----------------&gt; Bitcoin (not ok to dismiss)
Bitcoin -( small gap )-&gt; Litecoin (not proven to be superior Bitcoin and if superior, only slightly so, ok to dismiss)
Litecoin -( ^tiny ^gap )-&gt; Doge (nothing new here, ok to dismiss)
The Internet wouldn't switch over from TCP/IP to XXX/YY even if it promised to offer a 0.0001% speed advantage (the cost wouldn't be worth it). The web for example is widely considered as a pile of hacked together technologies but nothing has been proposed yet that has been considered better enough to replace it.

While hashing speed scales linearly with money invested, energy efficiency mostly doesn't. You only need one energy efficient miner (500$?) to be profitable. Furthermore, ASIC prices have been consistently falling and are actually getting more affordable to the general public, not the opposite.
The real danger at the moment is the centralization of mining pools. This is not a critical problem though as miners can relatively easily switch pools if a pool starts acting weird.

Roulette probably has one of the lowest house edge of all games at the casino so if you're going to gamble for fun, roulette might be the "less worse" option.

I would argue this is a "con". Vanity addresses can give a false sense of security to newbies (oh look, this address starts with 1dice of course it must belong to satoshi-dice). Or if a restaurant uses a vanity address (for example 1mcdo...) someone could replace the address/qrcode on the counter with another address that starts with 1mcdo and it could take the business owner a while to realize what happened ("why am I not receiving payment? ok, the address on the counter starts with 1mcdo, no one replaced it. maybe there's a bug with my bitcoin client?").

That might be true nowadays (not sure) but it wasn't true back then (AFAIK, search engines didn't rely on clicks/queries because it was easily gamed). In fact, nowadays search engines personalise results and use social network data so they do indeed benefit slightly from a network effect (the cost of switching is probably higher than it used to). 


I don't think it's about the exchange fee. It's about downloading the software, finding users who will accept the coin, availability of exchanges, ATMs, amount of people that have proof read the reference client, availability/diversity of wallets, etc.


Yes possibly. It's hard to say what such an improvement might be but I personally don't think the majority of altcoins qualify at the moment.

I believe this minimal information does include the previous block hash though so it would be possible for Ghash.io miners to notice if Ghash.io was trying to rewrite the block history. They would also notice that the found blocks are not relayed to the rest of the network. I concede that most hashers don't really pay attention to that information though.

It was just a dump of their Goxcoin database. Of course it shows that there is a total of 900K+ Goxcoins. If it didn't, people would have noticed a long time ago that MtGox was stealing them. What allegedly happened though is that those Goxcoins were not backed by actual Bitcoins and Karpeles didn't notice that until recently (hard to believe I know). 
Imagine a bank gets robbed and doesn't have any cash left. Someone hacks the bank's database and sees that they still have millions of dollars in deposits. Well the problem is that their database doesn't match reality. It doesn't mean that the bank has been lying about getting robbed.

No. Properly implemented, exchanges are supposed to hash the [user's username or email]( (whatever the user can guarantee is unique) with a nonce (for anonymity). Perhaps the API key is unique but how many users will verify that or even know how to do it? And how many people will suspect something is wrong when Coinfloor changes a user's API key? If they were malicious, they could give the same bogus API key to a bunch of people, wait for them to use it and when they report it's not working, give out a new one. Probably no one will even think this could be somehow related to the proof of solvency.

You are stating the obvious here: of course you will still make a profit as long as the tax is below 100%.
Also, you seem to misunderstand why people oppose the tax: the overhead cost.
Accounting is more or less a fixed cost (or at least, it is not linearly proportional to the amounts involved). If you are a high net worth individual who made 300K$ capital gains this year, you can afford to spend 10K$ on an accountant to do your taxes. If you are a small time investor who made 1000$ this year, the accounting cost might end up eating all of your profits (in other words, this would effectively be a &gt;100% tax for you).

In fact, I'm thinking of renaming the project to "blind liability proof". What it does is force an exchange to truthfully reveal what is the total of all their deposits. Let's say you are MtGox and you implement this scheme. If you have 500K BTC in deposits, you can't claim to only have 400K BTC in deposits because some of your users will find out they are not "included" in the tree you published. The other part of the scheme is proving that you also own the actual bitcoins which is easily done by signing a transaction. There is some more details available here:

A change of rules to the protocol would cause the blockchain to diverge (fork). In other words, there would now be OldBitcoin and NewBitcoin, two different currencies that are incompatible with each other. You would have the same amount of OldBitcoin and NewBitcoin on the day that the fork happens but from then on, any transaction done in NewBitcoins would not affect your OldBitcoin wallet and vice versa.
In the long term, probably only one of those currencies would survive as people chose which one they want to support. This would likely be influenced by which currency large mining pools decide to mine, large exchanges/payment processors/core developers decide to support, the Bitcoin foundation decides to endorse, etc.

If someone accused you of being the inventor of Bitcoin and you started making headlines of newspapers, wouldn't you read a bit about Bitcoin? I think you would. Yet this man gives the impression he knows nothing about Bitcoin: "2001 when it was being developed, I wasn't there... That's not me, I never communicated with bitcoins.". Two explanations come to mind: 
1) He is really Satoshi and is intentionally acting as someone who knows nothing about Bitcoin 
2) This man didn't care enough to research on the invention he is accused of inventing.

Miners receive transactions from the network. They put those transactions into a list which is commonly called a block. In order to get a block accepted by the network and be included in the "blockchain" (the list of all accepted blocks so far), miners have to solve the "mathematical problem" you mention. 
This problem a miner has to solve is simply to:
1) Compute the hash of the block they have assembled.
2) Verify that this hash is lower then a given number called a target (the target adjusts itself so that there is approximately 1 block "solved" every 10 minutes). 
If this hash isn't smaller then the target they are kind of out of luck... 
Just kidding! Blocks have some extra data fields apart from the list of transactions. One of those data fields is an arbitrary number called a "nonce" which can take any value. So in order to get a different block (and by extension, a different hash), miners repeatedly try different values for this nonce until they find a block whose hash is smaller then the target. 
In pseudo code:
    while (hash(transactions + nonce) &gt; target) {
      nonce = nonce + 1;
    }

Well if you insist.


Since both those values are provided by Coinfloor, they could have given the same values to multiple users with similar balances. If 10 of their users had ~100 BTC on the exchange, they would all be looking for the same hash in the list and there could be 900 BTC missing without anyone noticing. I'm not saying they actually did that - most likely they just didn't think about this potential issue. That's why standard schemes are good. Users just need to trust the standard scheme was reviewed independently once instead of having to review every scheme exchanges come up with.
But even more important than that is that the average user won't verify the proof if it requires them to understand cryptography or even read instructions in a blog post! A standard scheme allows the re-use of user friendly tools that allow users to verify proofs for different exchanges. Can you imagine if every website implemented HTTPS differently and they had to read some instructions every time they wanted to verify the HTTPS connection was secure?
By the way, the standard scheme is really easy to implement... there's no excuse for Coinfloor coming up with their own scheme (except maybe ignorance?). I could probably implement it for them in less than 2 hours if they let me.

Maybe he thought what he meant was relatively clear from the context, but apparently it wasn't to you.
Although SegWit supporters also want bigger blocks, "big blockers" usually describe people who want a "base" big block increase (e.g. as seen by a non upgraded node). So when someone says they support both SegWit and 2mb blocks, they likely mean "SegWit and 2mb [base]( blocks".

I am not sure what you mean by this but surely you will agree that no real consensus is possible with Proof of Work if some non benevolent entity controls over 50% of the hash rate?

It may have affected the timeline a bit but from what I recall, BIP148 was barely a blip on the radar prior to the NYA. Read news/blogs from around that time and you'll  that almost none of them mention BIP148/UASF (including the NYA [announcement post](
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:39:44
You are right, the BIP is from March. As far as I can tell however, it didn't have much momentum at the time and my guess is most miners didn't know about it when the NYA happened. I personally think the catalyst was rising fees and the realization that Bitcoin would stall indefinitely without a compromise.
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:17:24
1) Looking at the NYA signatories, I'd say money is following Segwit2x. We will see market prices after the fork.
2) I think you're wrong, I believe SegWit2x has a larger or at least, a more significant part of the ecosystem backing it (e.g. Bitpay, Coinbase, Chinese miners, etc.).
3) I disagree, but we'll see. If Segwit was activated because of UASF, miners won't follow through with the 2x since the same mechanism is at play here (a bunch of nodes threaten not to follow the Segwit2x chain).
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:40:52
1) It's not a corporate takeover, it's a slight block size increase which was the result of an industry wide agreement between both miners and non-miners.
2) There's no alternative. The old chain will become slow and insecure (vulnerable to double spend attacks) after the hard fork.
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:59:15
For all we know, bCash could be the 80085th fork that has happened to Bitcoin. It just received a bit more publicity. It's only a weakness in the sense that yes, Bitcoin has to compete with other currencies.

So is Greg's comment. He could have made his point without throwing a "It is superior to S2X." in there, but he did. If he doesn't want to get misquoted, he should tone down the hyperbole.
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:38:51


I was referring to this, which is just FUDing.


Also this. A lot (most?) of the current core developers had 0 real world crypto experience (let alone decades) prior to Bitcoin.


Following the S2X chain is optional, you are free to keep using the legacy chain with your beloved bitcoin-core developers (my hunch is that most will follow and contribute to S2X once the legacy chain becomes vulnerable to 51% attacks by multiple miners / pools).
Finally, no one is forcing you to do anything, relax and stop FUDing.

This is hard to determine with certainty but I think you are wrong. Coinbase, Bitpay and the Chinese exchanges **alone** account for a very large part of the Bitcoin economy. The market will answer that question when the hard fork happens.


Miners matter because they can do double spend attacks on chains with low hash rate (e.g. the non Segwit2x chain, bcash). You can refuse to use a chain, you can attempt to set the rules on a chain and get miners on board, but you can't safely use a chain or altcoin that is vulnerable to 51% attacks (you are free to take that risk though).

That's exactly what most of the community is doing in the form of Segwit2x. Ignore the FUD on both subreddits.
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:20:32
At the time it just felt like miners successfully used their power over SegWit activation in order to negotiate a deal which would include a big block hard fork in the future. That seems sufficient to explain their behavior... I doubt UASF was a significant factor in their decision making.

Most of the NYA signatories aren't "big blockers". The NYA was a compromise between both sides of the scaling debate (e.g. "SegWit supporters" vs "Big Blockers"). The reality is that Proof of Work is the best we have for decentralized consensus and if you believe it is flawed or unfair, you better start finding something better because we're stuck with it for now.
Also, you have to realize that gives a false impression of consensus among "users". This subreddit only represents a tiny fraction of all Bitcoin users (as evidence for this, look at all the ["I spotted this and that"]( posts where the subjects don't show up in threads). This is because is heavily moderated, dissenters get down voted to oblivion, but most importantly, a lot of people don't use Reddit or even know what it is.

Everyone who has BTC on Coinbase right now is implicitly voting for Segwit2x since Coinbase will follow the Segwit2x chain.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:36:34
Oops, Erik yeah :) What I explained though might help you understand what OP referred to by "big blockers". It is not referring to SegWit supporters (although yes SegWit does make blocks effectively bigger) but to people who want a "base" block size increase (as seen by a non SegWit upgraded node). Feel free to ask if anything is still unclear.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:52:22
I can't speak for everyone but my reasons:
1) losing pretty much all the hash rate hurts security much more
2) a 2x increase is not that much and not worth dividing the community over
3) the promise of a 2x increase was what got Segwit activated and it was a reasonable compromise that united both sides of the scaling debate (apart from some groups and individuals that felt their de-facto control over Bitcoin was being challenged)
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:11:58
Sorry to break it to you but SegWit activated because of the New York Agreement (SegWit2x).

First, I am not convinced that reducing the "usable" size of blocks results in higher overall revenue for miners. Would Apple increase their revenue by selling the iPhone for 10,000$? Probably not because there would be at least 10x less people buying it. It's reasonable to think that a similar mechanism is at play with transaction fees.
Second, if I'm wrong about the first point, that they are really maximizing their revenue by restricting the usable block size and all that... Why would they want bigger blocks? If they really found out that they maximize their revenues at say, 0.1 MB of usable block space, they would just maintain that artificial block size regardless of the max block size increase... What do they gain with big blocks? And why stop the spam after getting bigger blocks?
At least one of those things must be wrong... No?

Yes and if the majority wants a hard fork, I will follow the majority... I don't see how this is contradictory. Would you not say that supporting Ethereum Classic hurts the goal of keeping the Ethereum community united?
If your only goal is to keep a community united the literal optimal strategy is to always side with the majority. Of course, I wouldn't always do so but in this case, neither base block size parameter seems significantly better to me.
On a related note, S1X is the chain that is hard forking from the perspective of Segwit2x nodes.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:53:44
1) Those stats are a bit misleading. An uninformed reader would probably incorrectly infer that (100-17)% of companies are opposed to Segwit2x which is not the case. The % of companies that are opposed is 15% and much much lower (~1%) when you weight companies by their relative importance (e.g. traffic, # of customer, etc.).
2) That luke-jr poll suffers from selection bias and is probably not a representative sample of Coinbase customers. Think of Richard Dawkins hosting and promoting a poll on religion (e.g. results would be heavily biased towards atheism).

I don't think it will be that big of a deal (e.g. see Bitcoin Cash). There will probably be a clear winner within days, if not less. I don't think many S2X supporter will hang onto the S2X coin if its market value drops below the legacy coin's value and vice versa.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:44:54
But with weighting enabled, only 1% of companies oppose it. I am guessing most companies that haven't stated their position will go with the chain that "wins" (e.g. higher market price, hash rate, etc.).

Change "technical community" to "core developers" and your sentence goes from FUD to fact.


Most of full nodes yes, most of users no. Node running users represent less than 0.1% of the community. Your FUD just got factified.

How people value Bitcoin is very complex. I suspect for a lot of people "1" or "2" for the base block size parameter is not that big of a difference. What's left to decide which chain to follow? Hash rate and ecosystem, both arguably weigh in favor of Segwit2x.

@_date: 2017-09-28 08:17:01
An easier way to achieve that would be to use like 5-10% of Segwit2x's hash rate to mine empty blocks (or worse, rewrite history) on the legacy/S1X chain. I think this change is just about staying connected to the Bitcoin network until the fork happens.

Yes, that's why they would tell to use X independent parties, making trust in any one of them rather unimportant. You just need to trust that they're not colluding together against you... which becomes ridiculously unlikely as X gets larger (most SPV wallets do that automatically).


That one is easy to solve. You could send the transaction directly to a couple of nodes... that doesn't require downloading the blockchain.

I understand, but downloading and validating the blockchain does not in any way help your transactions get to miners, those are technically separate issues. If "network level" censorship is something you are concerned about, Tor for example would be better tool to combat that.
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:40:30


That is simply incorrect. If it was, there would have been at least one such attack in the history of Bitcoin. Also, I am not trying to introduce trust into the bitcoin system, I am simply reporting the argument of "big blockers". The whole point being that both big/small blockers are in favor of decentralization and which side is right or wrong is besides my point really.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:27:06
Yes, which is why I think bcash supporters are equally asking for trouble (and all atlcoiners who use Bitcoin's proof of work). The difference with the coming hard fork is that he old chain is the one that will lose hash rate and become vulnerable to attacks.

I am sure you will retain that power :)
You specifically refer to Segwit2x as a "backroom deal takeover" because you (and your fellow developers) weren't represented in the agreement. The main reason you are concerned about Segwit2x is that it went through without your ACK, is this not accurate? If not, why do you complain about "backroom deal takeovers" and not about the "2mb base block size"? Sure, you have some good technical arguments against 2mb but let's face it, that's not the main issue here and 2mb isn't going to kill Bitcoin.

I think he noticed that "big blockers" often cited Satoshi in support of their vision for scaling.

I can see how it could be tempting to think Satoshi is on your side, to the point of ignoring evidence. And sadly, many people fell (and still fall) for it.

@_date: 2017-09-28 19:43:32
Let's say they had done all that and yet, the core development hadn't approved their changes. Would you then have considered Segwit2x acceptable?
What I am getting at is a very large fraction of the community tried to go through that process for years, without any result.
They felt their opinions and interests weren't properly represented by those in charge of ultimately approving changes. Yes, there are individuals (not companies) who hold the power to make those decisions in the bitcoin core repository. And as is common in technical circles, this group of individuals suffers from groupthink (dissent is strongly discouraged, see their treatment and vilification of some previous collaborators). Of course, anyone can attempt to get changes approved.
In short, I find it hard to blame them for getting in a hotel room after being mislead or ignored by the formal bitcoin core process for years. A lot of the people that were in that hotel rooms are massive Bitcoin stakeholders and have basically their entire fortune and time invested into Bitcoin. Their interests are very much aligned with Bitcoin's long term success, more so than most core developers. Those who claim otherwise (e.g. that they are bankers who want Bitcoin to fail) are just FUDing.
In the end, they couldn't stand to witness Bitcoin loses out to competitors due to transaction fees and lack of progress. Perfect is the enemy of good and drastic times call for drastic measures.

That's exactly my point! Everyone is welcome on github.com/btc1 as well, but guess what, some core developers won't because they don't have commit access. Actually, they could even make bitcoin core compatible with s2x and keep contributing from their repo but they won't.

Dear core developers are increasingly seen as a source of centralization and the way you are behaving about Segwit2x seems to confirm what many are fearing. It is obvious that you are struggling to retain your power over Bitcoin and that you are not ready to put the community's best interest ahead of your own.
You are an incredibly talented developer but others can and will take your place if needed.

I'm surprised that so few signatories have broken their commitment so far (like often happens with these sort of deals).

Whether it is going to be successful in the long term is still uncertain but it will eventually be decided by the market.

Are you saying there's no attack?
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:38:40
1) 
2) 90%+ of the hash rate will leave the legacy chain. Which means that blocks will take much longer to confirm and any miner that currently has over 5% of the hash rate will be able to perform 51% attacks on the legacy chain after the fork.
3) If you don't see one then fine, but I can assure you those sound like different things to most people.

There are an [estimated 2590 nodes]( Bitcoin nodes in the US right now and 9508 in the world. Coinbase alone has over a thousand times that many users. This subreddit has over a hundred times that many subscribers. In other words, node running users represent a ridiculously small fraction of Bitcoin users.


Indeed and that will ultimately be discovered through the market price.

Great thing about Bitcoin is no one can force you to follow Segwit2x :)
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:27:00
It's true that they say most end users should not be running full nodes. It's not true that they say "trust, don't verify". That's FUD.
Even when you use a bank account, you are doing much more than just "trust, don't verify". For example, you make sure your bank has a history of being reputable, you try to withdraw once in a while, etc. Now, using a Bitcoin SPV wallet requires way, way less trust than using a bank account.
Fun fact: a lot of Bitcoiners support bigger blocks specifically because they are worried that small blocks will lead to more centralization (mind blown!). The argument being that if block size remains constant, it's going to become unaffordable for average Joe to do "on chain" transactions, forcing him to do "off chain" transactions through trusted intermediaries. While they may be wrong, it's a real concern they have.
Down with the FUD.

1) NYA participants rightly knew that the UASF BIP148 wouldn't get SegWit activated.
2) After the fork, the legacy chain will draw mining defectors from the NYA **if** it remains more valuable (not likely IMO).
3) If you want to call the largest such industry-wide agreement in the history of Bitcoin a "closed-door meeting", "a hostile takeover" and such, that's your business, but people in the real world picture those terms differently. You also imply that Eric Lombrozo was the only "community" member present at the meeting while other representatives were not, which is of course FUD. AFAIK, the few exchanges you listed merely didn't sign the agreement but didn't come out against it. Again, FUDing.
Please stop FUDing, thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:18:57
1) Segwit2x is what got Segwit activated. 
2) After the fork, the legacy chain will slow to a crawl and become vulnerable to attacks.
3) Segwit2x was the result of an industry wide compromise between "big blockers" and "segwit supporters", not a "hostile corporate takeover". 
You are free to follow the legacy chain after the fork but can we all just stop FUDing? Thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:26:08
Well in that case, the best you can do is keep using the legacy chain after the fork. There really isn't much else to discuss.

Remember when people were derisive of altcoins because of their comparatively low hash rate? ^ ^
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:38:32
It's mostly a power struggle between core developers vs rest of ecosystem.
The ecosystem was divided for years on how to scale Bitcoin but they (big/small blockers) finally agreed to compromise (Segwit + 2x). Bitcoin Core developers refused to compromise as they never had to in the past. They know that compromise would mean acknowledging they are no longer the sole guardians of Bitcoin's roadmap. 
Core developers are largely associated with the people who run this subreddit and many of its users. There has been a lot of astroturfing, FUD and propaganda aimed at spreading the following narrative:
- Core developers are the only ones who care about users
- Everyone else is trying to centralize and control Bitcoin
- Core developers are selfless, everyone else is greedy
- If you are not completely aligned with core developers (including past core developers), you are an enemy of Bitcoin and want it to fail
A lot of users are seduced by this narrative as it makes them feel like "freedom fighters". They have to put up with a lot of cognitive dissonance when faced with reality though.

@_date: 2017-09-28 02:27:00
That is correct. I have a slight preference for S2X but ultimately, my preferred chain is the chain of the economic majority and majority hash rate (I doubt those can diverge for very long).
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:29:23
It's the most consensus we've had in the last 3 years of scaling debate and was responsible for getting Segwit activated. If Segwit2x fails, I don't think consensus on a hard or soft fork will be possible for many, many years.  ^

As an uninformed observer, I am tempted to believe parent's story simply because of Occam's razor. It would explain why miners aren't cooperating with you. Why aren't miners signaling segwit? I am asking genuinely and find it very hard to believe it's all about fees. Any loss of fee income would surely be dwarfed by a growing market cap and adoption.

You don't have to trust them, you can see for yourself by running a node and looking at your transaction mempool: 
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:20:53
How long have you been using Bitcoin? A few years ago, there was a fear that the small block limit would lead to centralization (yeah, seriously). With a limited block size and growing usage, fees were bound to increase and become unaffordable for the average consumer. This would lead consumers to do most of their transactions "off chain" through "bitcoin banks" like Coinbase/Bitpay/etc. which in turn would do "on chain" transactions only when absolutely necessary.
Anyways, my point is simply to illustrate that being in favor of larger blocks isn't necessarily a vote for centralization and vice versa. I am guessing that the majority of big block supporters are as much concerned about centralization as you even if you disagree with them.

Amen. I've been trying to hint at this multiple times in this subreddit and always get down voted to hell when I do. It's clear that the miners didn't activate SegWit out of resentment (justified or not) towards the core devs. But for some reason, core devs [won't acknowledge it](

So basically, it's all because of fees and you do believe they are acting in their best self-interest (that is, they would lose significant revenue by activating segwit).
Don't you think that, in the long term, increased usage and market value of Bitcoin would make up for any fees lost to segwit?

One thing that will really help is when people start pricing stuff in BTC. In a sense, it's a form of pegging. For example, if a shop sells a TV for 1 BTC, they are in a way pegging 1 BTC to 1 TV. I know, it's a sketchy analogy. That being said, it's a chicken and egg problem. People don't want to risk pricing stuff in Bitcoin due to its high volatility and the high volatility is caused by the lack of stuff priced in BTC. Another thing that will help is when Bitcoin reaches a more mainstream audience which should lower the ratio of speculators. In my opinion, it will take a long time before Bitcoin's volatility approaches that of gold and an even longer time to approach the volatility of USD.

No, it was a trick to compare his writing style / ink color to the one used on the dollar bill. They look suspiciously similar to me :) Nice try OP, I do share your enthusiasm for Bitcoin but I don't buy your story.

The same could be said of Hong Kong or Singapore no longer than 50 years ago. And Cyprus is way ahead of what those countries looked like back then.

To be fair, most people don't truly understand USD and still use US dollars.
