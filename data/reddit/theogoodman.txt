If you are more afraid of  the nail then bet on the nail winning, if you have nightmares about MT and yourself then bet on the happening. Then at least you get paid when it happens.

There is no disadvantage of converting on site to usd. In fact then you dont have to worry about any price movements. On top of that there are more propbets, good odds and deposit bonuses. 
This is the reality of what "pure" bitcoin sportsbooks are up against. The established offshore books that have been around for years that offer sharp odds and high limits. Instead of launching ideological arguments of usd vs btc ect sportsbooks should concentrate on doing what sportsbooks do. Offering good odds, pomos, deposit bonuses ect.  Thanks for pointing out your odds, it looks like [bitcoinrush]( updated the sportsbook?

It doesnt matter who is running in regards to betting. You said the people betting lose, but really the people that bet are the only ones that win. If you dont bet you cant win. hahahahahhhaahha

I have never heard of any goverment censorship of fish checksums that are timestamped. Just in case it is good to be prepared. 
Archive.org could get hacked and someone could remove the checksum, that does not mean that right now it is not a lot easier and trustworthy enough to use. 
I cant make a cool metacoin on counterparty that funds a startup that is going to put checksums on archive.org (or maybe I could) Archivoid
I can make a cool metacoin using counterparty that funds a startup that is going to put checksums in some kind of blockchain thingie. Thingiecoin or Truthoid. 
Of course there would be timestamped benchmarks with checksums that would be stamped into a private blockchain and then a hash of the entire private blockchian would be put on the bitcoin blockchain but I would use some other cool words to describe the process even if it doesnt make sense or there is no need or demand for it. It is kind of like an artproject.

Lets not over complicate things. What about just sending people bitcoin. In theory if there was a mining pool that would accept low or no fee transactions it would help. It should be possible to click on a user name and get their btc address and qr code, or have on site "fun wallets" for tipping, in bitcoin (that is centalized though).

The delegates make it more centralised, this is not more secure. A dictatorship is also faster and sometimes even cheaper, doesnt make it better. If/When the delegates collude to charge a minimum fee for approving transactions and ammount of burn, that just sounds really secure. This is just one example. Different, yes, more secure?

you can follow the directions in the video that I made at soundwallet.net and just use text instead of a private key, or just send me the text you want as audio.
@_date: 2014-12-25 21:00:06
Linemen = Are like miners, they get almost no credit and do most of the work. When something goes wrong they are the first to blame. They are expected to preform perfectly at all times, without them NOTHING works.
Quarterback/Middle Linebacker = Core devs, they dont have total control but set the tone and direction of play, on the defense this is done by the Middle Linebacker
Running Backs / Linebackers = Simple Apps that work but normaly dont "WOW" anyone, stable and get the job done in a simple way, do some of grunt work and get a bit of credit for it.. = BitcoinQT 
Wide Recivers/Cornerbacks-Saftey = These are like those apps and projects that sound crazy great but might turn out to do nothing. When they come into play there can be fireworks but sometimes you never hear about them the whole game. When they do something good they get a lot of credit. Etherium, Counterparty, Blockchain apps
Kicker, Punter = one trick pony that is always expected to perform well, gets lots of credit if they decide the game. Lightweight and cant take a lot of abuse. Multibit, Electrum
Special Teams = Normaly with a kicker or punter, these guys are sometimes ONLY on the ST or double and play another position too. These groups of players come on at key situhations: kickoffs, punts, field goals, extra points. These can be key sithuations in the game where the offense becomes the defense and the defense becomes the offense. Just like Altcoins they can be a game changer but sometimes do nothing or can be total failures for a team. They have positions like "punt returner" that only appear during a punt, like altocoins that have features like no other coin.

How many "tips" in % of total tips and $ ammount of tips are sent by CT employees, Pantera, or people that CT has given funds to in order to "tip" people? 
How many "tips" have been accepted vs. not collected?
Why is this interview being recorded and not done live?
How is a CT employee targeting "famous" people and sending "tipping" them 1$ promoting bitcoin as opposed to promoting CT? 
When will you start charging fees?
How does CT make money?
If CT does not make money now, how do they plan on doing so?
Allthough users -may- "have control" of their data on CT what is to prevent a company buying CT database of user info included?
Will CT censor tips, or reverse tips if people tip ISIS, ISIL , Ross Ulbricht or any other convicted fellon, US declared terror group or other "illegal" twi

@_date: 2015-03-27 11:18:39
  lets discuss bitcoin and tipping
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:35:25
I would asume that "Charles Norton ‏ " works for CT in some fashion, or was given funds to tip a list of people. Then another employee is to take this info over to r/bitcoin and spam about how their company gets person X to accept tips using their service. Title should read "CT Sends tips to people, 53% accept" , If what I am asuming is wrong then please correct , the more you know...... , If it was in fact some kind of employee of CT that sent a "tip" is this really a "tip"? On the clock targeting of "famous" people  and sending them 2 cents in bitcoin is not exactly the same as tipping someone for a job well done. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:49:35
I feel like im Santa Claus and everyone is yelling at me because I asked how it works. 
It used to be different, the more you know...........
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:01:32
So back to another few questions here since eveyone here wants to know more. 
- Did an employee of CT tip him?
BTW over 43% of so called "tips" go unclaimed
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:02:33
Good Job Bruce
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:45:50
Yes, however nobody knows if the tip was accepted, simply connecting via twitter does not mean the "tip" was accepted. There is no public information about how many "tips" are returned. We also do not know how many "tips" are sent from CT slave-bot twitter accounts. Again I ask, Did someone from CT tip him? Why was he tipped: To promote CT or to tip him? 
@_date: 2015-02-02 22:20:59
Did someone from CT tip him? Why? To promote CT or to tip him for something? Has he accepted the tip, how can we prove that he has accepted the tip? Thanks

@_date: 2016-05-16 04:52:11
Okcoin cn makes money on swap lending and fees on fiat in and out. CEX makes money on people buying bitcoin with credit card. That is how they can offer zero fee trading. Zero trade fee does make the volume go up and can include wash trading.
