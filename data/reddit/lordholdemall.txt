Yea but if the whole market is falling why would you keep money in btc and watch it fall at a slightly slower rate then the alts ? Makes no sense 
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:16:03
You pay tax on your car, you pay tax on food, you pay tax on clothes you pay tax everything you buy with your money that has been taxed .. So no it's not a minuscule amount is it ..  You brainwashed drone

It's more the blockchain tech not Bitcoin itself that will enable cool and crazy stuff...

Your tax pays for schools that teach people to get a job to pay tax . You pay tax for roads that get you to the job that pays them tax .free healthcare ..if everyone's sick or dying no one pays tax . Just In case you haven't got it yet .. They make you pay money so you can keep paying them money .. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:20:18
We are making a meal of this this 10k ... Come on bitcone !!
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:31:52
The fact you think they have your best interests at heart is hilarious .. How much do roads cost ? Are they not already built ? university give you a list of subjects to choose from so you can study what you want as long as it's on the list lol .. Then we have student loans .. Borrow money and get in debt to study to get a job to pay tax ! Unreal 
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:55:28

Why because you can't refute any of my points ? ��
@_date: 2018-05-13 05:23:23
so once they make it illegal to hold any undeclared crypto what are you gonna do ? They know you have some because your transactions have been linked to your account which was made using your address and passport .. you have left a trail already .. Simple as that .

How did you set up your account on bittrex ?? Passport ? Address ? Bank account ? You think your movements within bittrex are invisible ? How do you plan to cash out ? Every time you buy or cash out its logged even if you send your btc to a different account it's still come from your original account that they have all your details for .. Lol .. They will wait until enough people are involved then all of a sudden you will have to declare how much crypto you have anyone that's ever made an account on any crypto exchange will be first to be sent a letter to the address that you used to open your account asking to declare your amount .. I can't actually believe people think this is running outside of the govenment .. Bitcoin is everywhere mainstream media is covering it all the time .. If it was a rogue project there would be a media blackout .. The fact celebrities are pushing it should have rung a few bells .. You are extremely naive to think you are some kind of outlier .. Greed is leading us straight into their trap .
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:41:50

Anyone who thinks tax is theft is antisocial that's brilliant mate .. Just bend over and take it then buddy.. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:25:16
How much does it cost to maintain roads mate ? Compared to the total tax revenue ? Come on man that's a silly point . Student loans are a choice to people that can afford to go to school .. Not everyone's in a position to work and study ..loans are offered, pushed even .. Your healthcare is free the same as here in the uk but is it really free ? The U.K. Tax bracket if you earn £50,000 a year is 40% the USA tax is nowhere near that ! Healthcare is not free they just take it from other places .. And I'm not sure what you mean hold forever .. You can spend crypto

Eat my shorts dude ... Literally 
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:04:35
Of course they know it's there . To buy or cash out any Bitcoin you need to give them all your details.. Passport, bank account,home address ..  They know exactly how much you have and where you live .. Bitcoin is a government run project ..all this talk of becoming free of the system is just a carrot in front of our faces we are walking straight into a system  ( blockchain ) that will enslave us 10 times more then we are now .. They want a cashless society and always have done .. I can't believe people actually think satoshi is some rogue genius that just happened to invent the most paradigm shifting tech since the Internet .. Bitcoin is exactly what the elite have always wanted ..  One world currncy ..This is not a way out of the system we early adopters might be ok but everyone else is fucked ...﻿
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:39:16

How many people have used that combination of using binance and local bitcoins ? How many of those people used a Vpn ? 1% of the 0.1 %  and  you still have to cash out ..is the average person gonna do that ? Go and meet some random person and hand over or recive  large amounts of cash ?? the 99% of people will use exchanges to buy Bitcoin .. And if they made it illegal to not declare crypto i.e. Carries the same punishment as tax avasion are you going to Risk going to prison ?? .. Of course some people will but the 99.9 % will comply .. They could ban exchanges in a second if they wanted to .. You think you are outside of the system ? Lol .. They are letting this happen .. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 01:13:39

@_date: 2019-03-11 21:59:59
The fact everyone thinks it's gonna go up is making me think it's gonna go down ..  I think we double bottom at  3100 then it will take off ..

We are at the start of a new 4 year cycle..  if you brought last year you got in during a correction .. I.e the end of a 4 year cycle .. 5k means the new cycle has started .. Be patient the gains in 2 years will be life changing 
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:35:32
Mate I don't mean to be a dick but if you brought at 20k it's completely your fault .. Not btc .. You literally brought at the worst time in the entire history of btc .. You will have to wait a while for it to get back to that level or you should have been buying these last few months to bring your average buy in price down 
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:49:45

@_date: 2018-12-20 09:43:06
Lol btc is priced in fiat.. 
Bitcoin is a government project ..
Every trading platform has your address, passport and bank account details .. If they waned to put a 80% tax on Bitcoin there's nothing you could do .. Blockchain is not freedom it's the ultimate form of control.
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:16:46
The irony of that statement is amazing 
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:21:33
You haven't said anything .. Literally nothing.. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:20:24
Haha how have you got privacy ?? every platform that's used to buy crypto have your address and  Passport details, your IP address ..  you are delusional ..  Every transaction is logged on the blockchain .. If you send your crypto to a private wallet it's come from your account that has your details ..it's the complete opposite of private LOL .. Cash is the only truly private untraceable currency that's why there are getting rid of it ... Blockchain It's a government project .. One world currency is the goal
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:04:43
It's the same thing .. Government agency

· If you are looking for bankruptcy I can tell you i will not sell, but what I do have are a very particular set of coins. Coins I have acquired over a very long career. Coins that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let Bitcoin grow now that'll be the end of it.
@_date: 2018-12-21 06:20:23
"As far removed from the government as possible" You have no evidence to back that up .. Cryptographers working for intellengance agencies made Bitcoin .. .. The fact you are saying I'm full of shit because I'm saying its a fact, in turn also applies to you in this case .. You understand that right ? You are claiming its made by a rogue tech genius as a FACT .. With no evidence .. There's plenty I don't know I'm not claiming to be smarter then anyone .. This is just very obvious to me .

Dear Investor, if you’re reading this you’ve been holding out.. and if you’ve come this far maybe you’re willing to come a little further.

The deep web was a DARPA invention called the onion router I.e tor browser .. The tor browser was a government tool to send and receive documents etc securely ..Bitcoin among many other uses was invented and used by CIA ... NSA to fund other intellengance agencies worldwide with no trace.. It was tested this way to begin with then made available to the public for the reasons I've already stated .. the Internet and deep web are government projects .. Why can't you see that this is exactly the same .. I don't get what's so hard to believe
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:21:25
Ok while there maybe a few people like yourself that will go through all the measures to try and stay private. Even though I still think they can track it .. the other 99% of people that don't have any crypto atm won't .. And it's the actual blockchain tech that's going to be the problem not just currency .. I genuinely think they want to digitalise everything .. all the data about every person stored on the blockchain .. Our medical records, police records, properties, recent transactions etc all under a number linked to our name.. That's accessible by anyone that wants to look .. I get that social security is pretty much that but this is a airtight way of doing it .. No way to hide anything .. The current system has to many holes .. People know how to play it ..
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:44:55
How do you cash out ?? Into your bank account..  it's logged ..  Your bank has all of you details .. By the  time crypto replaces cash you will need to show id everywhere .. You think the governments are going let some rogue project invented by a random person overtake their current system ?? If they didn't want it here you wouldn't be able to cash out into your bank .. They would just ban transfers .. How are people so naive LOL .. it is a government project .. You actually think some mystery guy that no one knows made it ??.. It was made to replace cash as cash is the only true untraceable private currency 
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:33:32
No it's not .. It's an advanced version of the same thing.. they know when you sent it , when you brought it, how much you brought,  and what address you sent it to .. Think about it .. It's not made for us it's for them ..

where do you buy Monero ? On a exchange which will either need a payment from your bank or transfer from a wallet .. that wallet is traceable .. It's not made to help us it's made to help them track every single Purchase we do  .. I believe our medical records .. Bank balance .. Everything we own will be on the blockchain .. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:44:59
LOL the  government won't help you now son .. If you brought at anything above 10 k you're an idiot .. No one held a gun to ya head and told you to buy .. It's a cycle this has happened before if you're this upset by it .. maybe just get out

Some friends of yours mined btc ... And ??? So what .. What's the point your making .. You think some nerds that mined a few btc are ahead of the nsa, cia .. lol the deep web Was invented by DARPA  the whole onion router project is a government idea ..

The whales are everywhere. They are all around us. Even now, in this very forum. You can see them when you log into bittrex or when you turn on trading view. You can feel it when you go to work … when you look at you bank account … when you pay your taxes. It is the manipulation that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
