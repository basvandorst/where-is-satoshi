Nah , i've been in and teaching myself about bitcoin since 2012 and being an Adult I can take educated guesses about where to put my Hard earned fiat confetti. Maybe you need to visit that subreddit. Cheers ;-)
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:04:10
The value you should focus on is Bitcoin. The fiat profit isnt really profit, rather how much confetti your Bitcoin is worth. Have a great day.

All what you perceive is a reflection of you. You're talking ass. Bitcoin is amazing technology that everyone teaches themselves about, so why are you getting pissy when people enjoy the price swings. If you grew a seed of your favourite plant and spent time on it would you not be happy with the growth? Or would you attack yourself for feeling as such? Wakeup.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:03:41
I buy regardless of price.

@_date: 2017-09-04 07:54:11
How many people over the years at every price range has said this? You're obviously new and know Bitcoin doesn't follow conventional charts or data. 
TL;DR: Bitcoin will never do what you say.

if you want your savings to slowly reduce to $0, then by all means go ahead with the more traditional retirement savings accounts. That said - If you want to times your wealth by 100 fold in the coming years; then buy some Bitcoin right now.
