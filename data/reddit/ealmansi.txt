r/btc and bitcoin.com have existed since long before BCH.
They were most definitely not created to promote Bitcoin Cash like claims, although they openly support BCH today.

Besides, 10 minutes is too long to verify that payment is good.  It needs to be as fast as swiping a credit card is today.

It's the top post right now.

What you're saying is not wrong, but IMHO you are overplaying the risk factor.
What I meant is a service similar to Bitpay's BCH recovery tool ([link]( Most Bitcoin users already trust the developers of their wallet software of choice, so trusting them with a simple splitting service wouldn't be that much of a stretch.
It's really not the same situation as people trusting their private keys to Electron Cash, written by a new developer and in short notice.

How exactly did you arrive at this conclusion?


Do you understand really how easily and cheaply these metrics can be gamed?


I really don't understand how you can be advocating for losing over 70% of the network's hashrate overnight. Hashrate is what keeps Bitcoin sovereign by making it exceedingly expensive for any government to tamper with your money.

A sample size of 1% of the population is very decent **if** we're talking of a random, unbiased sample.
In this case, the 1% sample was all but random and unbiased.

Tom Zander is not a SegWit2x developer.
He's Bitcoin Classic's lead dev.

is not predominantly pro-SegWit2x.
It is predominantly anti-Core.

Nope, Classic.

Maintaining status quo indefinitely can also be a form of suicide.

After the fork, there's only risk if you move your funds before things stabilize. If you hold, then *nothing* can happen to your Bitcoin.
As a typical user/holder you will probably simply want to hold until the storm is over, so you won't lose any of your funds. The downside will be not being able to move your money during this period.
If you wished to exchange your coins on either side of the chain speculatively right after the split, that would require some care and possibly technical knowledge to carry out safely and without jeopardizing any funds.
Edit: More specifically, it could be similar to BCH in that there'd be two separate chains with different values. And it would be different in that, this time, moving funds in one chain could cause you to inadvertently move your funds on the other chain.

The fraudulent scheme you suggest is very much feasible on technical grounds. The hard part is: how do you convince people that your fork has any value?
For it to work, you need to convince people to: download new wallet software, move their pre-fork Bitcoin to a new wallet, import their Bitcoin private keys to their newly downloaded wallet application, *and* have some exchange willing to trade your new coins for something else that is valuable. All this while your fork gets publicly called out for not having replay protection, and likely also a severe difficulty reduction.
Coding the fork with no replay protection and generating a chain split would be the easiest part.
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:37:27
There are many possibilities: one of the chains dies, one of the chains adds replay protection, opt-in replay protection becomes widely adopted, coin splitting services become readily available, others.
Whatever happens, it's unlikely that the period where funds cannot be moved safely will last very long.
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:38:10
IIRC the opt-in replay protection means that you can create a transaction that is only valid on the 1X chain by adding a txout containing OP_RETURN and a specific marker.
It's definitely not as convenient as having full, two-sided replay protection, but it's rather trivial to implement a coin splitting service based on it if I'm not mistaken.
