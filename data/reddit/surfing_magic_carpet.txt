I think this is more of a problem with the current environment than Bitcoin as a concept or program, but the barrier for entry is relatively high in comparison to a traditional checking account. People aren't going to adopt a currency where you have to go on an exchange, deposit funds, buy coins, transfer them to your own wallet or risk the exchange pulling an exit scam. Banks can't pull that shit and it makes Bitcoin scary to the average person. Sure most of us are accustomed to the risk, but a lot of outsiders hear about how exchanges abscond with people's money and aren't going to take that risk.
Anyways, it's a lot of effort to dive into Bitcoin for the average tech-illiterate person. It requires more research than most people want to spend time on, whereas a debit card is so ubiquitous that everyone is already familiar with it's use. And I get that a phone wallet is pretty simple; scan the QR code, press send to pay, done; but again it's intimidating to someone who has never used it before. Bitcoin needs to be as easy as a debit card before people will begin to consider it as a payment method.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:59:57
The fee of Debit/Credit transactions in the US being 3.99% doesn't actually sound radical to me. Consider that any time you pay for goods at a store with card, Visa or MasterCard take anywhere from 3% to 5%, so the stores usually factor that loss into the price. I've seen plenty of smaller stores do the whole "Minimum $5 sale for Debit/Credit" or "Cash price: $X.xx/Card price: $Y.yy" to sort of make up for the card fees.
Anyways, Coinbase probably figured upping their fees to typical market levels offsets their losses. Besides, Coinbase is a business after all, and despite all the bitching on they seem to be one of the most stable and most likely to comply with the law (in other words they probably won't up and leave like plenty of other exchanges.). In order to not take your money and run they make their money in other ways, fees. They're also not doing fractional lending like a typical bank, so they aren't getting that income.
So, yeah, I like CB because they're the easiest and cheapest way for me to pay my rent right now. I'm not playing the market so I don't go on big exchanges and gamble with "maybe they'll still be around tomorrow when my order finishes" or "I hope they don't steal everyone's money while I'm trying to pay my bills." CB also still costs less than getting and mailing a cashiers check. So I'm fine with fees that are close to what pretty much every other business probably pays.

I learned to live with my choices. I could have a couple hundred thousand right now, but I needed other things instead. I could dwell on what I don't have, but the truth is what I do have is in some ways more valuable. That and even if I knew back then that I could have become rich, it wouldn't have changed my immediate needs. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:59:01
I think that if we want to see big businesses adopt bitcoin then we need some tax laws regarding its use. Basically, no large company is going to touch Bitcoin until they have some clear cut directions on how to report it and whatnot. If anything, getting a few laws on the books will relax larger corporations and make them more receptive to bitcoin because they'll know what they can and can't do. In other words, a lot of companies don't want to risk adopting bitcoin before any laws are laid down because it gets tougher to try to keep up with the changes as they happen than it is to know what you're doing once laws are on the books.

I got to the same conclusion a few months back too. I don't care what the price is as long as it's not $0 because I like using Bitcoin to buy things. I have a bookmark tab for Preev that saved back when Bitcoin was $46.80 and it reminds me if all the price fluctuations; the sharp rises and falls we experienced over the past year... I wanted Bitcoin to be some way for me to get rich and get out of debt, but now I just want Bitcoin to be the way we handle transactions. It's almost a "Bitcoin Coming-of-Age" thing
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:29:16
I doubt it, it'd be like saying "I know the price of gold is about to go up, is it illegal for me to buy gold?" The problem with stocks is that you're buying a stake in a company, and when you manipulate stocks you're affecting the direction of that company and the lives of its employees. If you decided to pump and dump a company you could ruin that company and put a lot of people out on the streets. Also, it's about having an unfair advantage over other businesses when you inside trade. You're removing competition from the marketplace by having inside knowledge of a stock's value.
But I'm no SEC lawyer, so I could be wrong. Bitcoin isn't a stock or a future, it's basically a commodity and I don't know if commodities are as regulated.
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:25:32
I think gold isn't really regulated, you can buy it pretty easily, jewelry stores and whatnot. So I think someone would have a pretty hard time proving that you bought gold because of that information. Stocks are pretty specific, though. Like I couldn't buy Microsoft stock and benefit from Intel going up. Someone might be able to prove that buying a LOT of Intel stock right before it goes up means you knew about something Intel was about to do. Even with gold or Bitcoin, the value doesn't shift that wildly and a lot of gold would be required to suddenly and drastically increase its value.

Been having similar issues. Small amount transfers cost almost as much as you're trying to send. Maybe if you need to send thousands or millions of dollars it's cheaper than standard wire services, but right now I'd rather use a traditional payment method.
This sucks. I really love Bitcoin, been around since 2012 or so, and I'm glad we're getting widespread adoption, but I think the end goal of being a payment service for the poorest of people has been squashed. I used to tell people "If I wanted to send someone in Africa $10 they could get it and use it in less than an hour." But now I'd pay $5 to send $10 and they'd lose half their money the money they tried to spend it too. A little hyperbolic, but still, we're getting too expensive for small transfers. I hope we sort this out, but if not Bitcoin will remain an investment and alts will be used for payments.
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:05:29
Yep, you're absolutely right. But the end result is a bunch of people growing up without a strong education because of a poor family and the economy suffers. Do you REALLY think that industrialized nations implemented education systems just to fuck people out of money? No, they did it because they knew that smart workers earn more money, earning more means spending more, and spending more means a stronger economy. Taxing a large group of people offsets cost for individuals; instead of the high cost of sending your kids to private school, people who don't even have kids pay a few bucks so every child at least has an education.
Argue with it all you want, you're likely the product of a society where taxes benefited you immensely. You likely have no idea what a truly libertarian culture would look like, and probably would suffer under your idealistic society anyways. Taxes, even if you think they just steal your money, have been the reason why you've found success. Imagine paying to use a series of toll roads daily and get back to us about how abolishing minimum wage would create a perfect society.
Yeah, I assumed some things about your stance, but the kinds of people who make the statement you made tend to have similar views.
@_date: 2017-08-27 04:47:08
Shortest answer is to just pay your taxes. Yeah, it sucks that you might come away with just under $3m but guess what the alternative is? You want your assets seized and then you spend time in jail? Just get an accountant and don't be an idiot about it. $2.whatever million is still a great amount of money, don't get greedy and fuck yourself over.
That or send it all to me, I'll keep it, pay the taxes, and you'll be right where you started off. Easy come, easy go. RIght?

Seems to me there are more threats to larger establishments than to bitcoin. If I wanted to work on cryptography and try to steal money, I'd set my sights on large banks or military secrets. Bitcoin is big, but if you destroy bitcoin it doesnt matter how much you stole it's all worthless. But banks are backed by governments, if you steal fiat currency it can't drop too much in value.

If they use it internally and have a series of checks and balances in place, fine. I just won't use a bank that has a blockchain where someone can say "Oh, we 'edited' a system error and you're last deposit of $200 was actually $20." Then when someone says "No, I put in $200" they'll come back with "But our blockchain, a perfect ledger, says you only put in $20." I get that maybe they need it for other internal shit, but it just sounds like a new way to get hacked or have bankers edit money out of people's accounts under the guise that something more serious happened.
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:08:53
Price is just the most basic metric for how widespread we're becoming. We're not part of a technology that you can easily count its users, so price is the easiest way to show an increase in adoption. I do think some people are here as investors and aren't interested in the technology as much as the dollar value, but that dollar value still means adopters. It still means that someone bought into something they might have wanted as an investment, but when they discover how useful it is they'll convert.
Although, let's talk about the transaction fees on small transactions. That's getting expensive. I'm hoping it goes down sometime soon otherwise we will be relegated to an investment.

Only invest in what you're willing to lose, and yes, invest. But also consider using bitcoin when you have the opportunity to, it makes us stronger when we spend our money. It spreads the word and means more adopters. More adoption means better price and less volatility.

I buy bitcoins despite price fluctuations because I buy things with them.
I think if you're looking to invest, the best time to start is always "today." There's no way to know if your investment will yield a return until you buy, otherwise you're just watching the price saying "I wish I bought in when it was cheaper" "I'm glad I didn't buy because the price dropped." It's like watching waves at the beach deciding when to get in the water, just jump in and go swimming.

I don't think these guys expected such a huge result, at least that's my guess. A lot of these attacks seem to hit a handful of computers, get a media footnote, and peter out over a few days. This one probably intended to net a couple hundred bucks then fade out of attention so they could cash out. Now it sounds like it was poorly written code, poorly planned out, and has blown up quite a bit to the point that the guys responsible will have to sit on their coins or hope they can tumble them effectively. These guys should have created unique addresses for each infection so they could make tracking the coins more difficult, but they listed like 3 total.
I'm guessing they get caught making amateur mistakes with the coins because the whole thing screams amateur. Not babby's first malware, but at least babby's first big scam. They probably didn't have a contingency plan, and are now stuck with coins they'll have to sit on for a few months/years. At the very least these coins might go out of circulation and will just add to the scarcity of BTC

To be completely honest, we're talking about the actions of a few immoral people. You cannot effectively argue that an entire group of people are corrupt on the basis that a handful fucked up. The whole government isn't a force for evil simply because a tiny fraction made incredibly stupid decisions.
The majority of Bitcoin users don't launder money, buy drugs, etc, but some of us do. I'm going to assume, OP, that you don't like when people suggest that Bitcoin is nothing more than a criminal network. So it's a bit silly to say that the government is evil and we're good when our community has been irresponsible too.

I have a week old unconfirmed transaction because I made the mistake of not setting a proper fee in Electrum. I now have roughly $1k waiting to fit into a block and there are empty blocks? This fucking SUCKS. We're not going to get taken seriously as money if retailers see that they might wait a week for money to deposit. Especially considering I've been using BTC since May 2013, count myself as reasonably experienced, and I STILL made a mistake that's gotten my transaction hung up. New users are going to be fucking up left and right so the system needs some kind of idiot-proofing because empty blocks and unconfirmed transactions are gonna hurt us down the road.

Basically, if this passes, it means not only will people have taxes taken out of their paychecks (like normal) but they'll also be taxed for putting their money in their savings. That's taxing their income twice, and really fucked up. Unless it only taxes deposits exceeding, say $10,000 (or some other large amount), it's going to have the largest impact on the working class and drive them even further away from trying to save. If I were going to lose money by putting it in a savings account, I'm not going to use a bank. Plus it's not like we all have a banana stand, either.

Thing is, I don't see SegWit being on the minds of new users. It's important to people interested in the technology aspect, but it's akin to Visa saying adding some new internal features will increase value to cardholders. Most people aren't interested in how it works as long as it works, so saying "Implement SegWit, add boosters to moon rocket" is silly. Sure, it'll definitely be helpful and probably increase value, but it's not going to make us rich by simply adding it.

I just think it's incredibly unlikely someone tampered with it.

I don't buy based on what I read because I don't have the spare money, but I think it's fair to say that a lot of the predictions come from more than people just saying "I think today the price will go up/down." If you account for what articles people are reading, I think you'll find a lot of buying/selling is reactionary. If a negative article gets posted, people sell, and vice versa. Every time the Bank of China says something bad about BTC the price drops. So if I'm reading articles and posts on forums following these events I could probably make an accurate prediction based on people's reactions. Seems pretty straightforward and not like a huge leap of logic

It'll be interesting to see if Satoshi ever emerges from hiding. At this point I think a lot of us suspect he/she/it probably has a very large quantity of BTC squirreled away and so should eventually become one of the richest people (or group of people) in the world. That is, unless Satoshi was perfectly content to create something revolutionary and never cash in on it. In fact, Satoshi probably won't appear until sometime after the political stigma of Bitcoin disappears.
As it is, Satoshi is entitled to reap the rewards of Bitcoin. Someone who went through all the trouble of creating something like this probably isn't stupid enough to abuse it for personal gain right away.

Even if someone infected the blockchain, we'd probably get a solution fixing it pretty quickly. The biggest asset our community has is that we're largely made up of tech-literate people. And for every bad-apple out there abusing the power of Bitcoin, there are thousands more that won't stand for it. Besides, successfully disrupting Bitcoin wouldn't really have any realistic positive effects. A lot of people could lose a lot of money, the drive to create new hash computing technology would stagnate, and if the disruption were traced back to a specific government it would cause unrest.
In all, I think this is something most of us kind of understood in the backs of our minds, and it's just not something I think we need to worry about much. Again, there are enough tech-savvy people in our community that, should this happen, there would likely be a solution shortly thereafter.

Wasn't a big bank in England implicated in funding terrorism a few years back? (edit: indirectly, of course. IIRC it was something they sorta knew about but didn't do anything to fix) I don't remember specific details, but the point is that going after Bitcoin seems like an attempt to redirect attention. Bitcoin is new and therefore terrifying to the old farts in government offices; they're also not likely to think about Bitcoin as favorably as we'd like thanks to the coverage of darknet markets. I suppose I just think terrorists would use more traditional means regardless.

I think Coinbase fits in the space of being newbie-friendly and safer than the exchanges have been.
I know when I opened a checking account last year they wanted pretty much the same information Coinbase wants; Name, address, social security number. So I think Coinbase is trying to operate in the same realm of legitimacy as banks and other financial institutions, and therefore requires those extra bits of information that other Bitcoin platforms don't. That said, Coinbase might be annoying, but it might also be the best place for people outside the community to start since it looks and feels more like a bank than a "hackers den" that would scare off older people.

You are obligated to pay taxes on any realized gains from any assets you sell. You'd need to report your gains in your taxes or you can say hello to a nasty IRS audit. Also, unfortunately for us, the US *could* decide that any goods we purchase with Bitcoins are taxable, but if you aren't buying expensive items with Bitcoins they won't really notice. Anyways, if I were you and I was going to exchange BTC into thousands of dollars, I'd get a Certified Public Accountant's advice first, or at *least* get one to file my taxes.
Also, unless you give them a reason to seize your assets, they'll likely just make sure you file your taxes accordingly. In other words, do go committing any money crimes any time soon and you'll be fine.

Seems to me that anywhere anonymity is offered, it's generally destroyed by its recipients.

Again, anyone could just look at the blockchain and see what they do with the balance of the wallets. Bitcoin is transparent to the point a bank would need to get creative to a cost prohibitive point. And again, since it's a bank, any client can withdraw their balance at any time, which would be incredibly disruptive to their system if they were trying to screw people over.

One of my fears for the future of bitcoin is that people who don't fully understand the ideas behind bitcoin will think they need to put bitcoins into a bank.

I'd get in on the Point Of Sale development side of things. This is the biggest problem we face, IMO, in getting widespread business adoption. Companies need a simple, fast method of checking customers out that would allow them to track transactions for accounting purposes. Without a dedicated point of sale system I don't think we'll see many companies looking to use bitcoin any time soon.

As far as I understand there isn't much potential for a 51% attack succeeding indefinitely. They'd need to fork the chain and get everyone thereafter to agree to their ledger. Then, the way the network works means they'd need to constantly reinvest in keeping 51%, at which point it's just attrition because they won't be getting anywhere near enough money per block to offset costs. Because the way the difficulty fluctuates to offset any spike or decline in the network's ability, a 51%er would likely only manage a single block.  After that they'd need significantly more computing power to deal with the substantial increase in difficulty. 
Also, I think if we saw a 51% attack coming, many of us would probably rally against it as best we can. There are a lot of Bitcoin "Doomsday" scenarios which are somewhat laughably easy to combat. Basically we're pretty safe unless we actively choose to let someone else destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:44:31
Ok, so conversely they could offer a 5% bitcoin discount if they wanted. They KNOW a bitcoin user has the funds available, can't reverse the charges, and that the money is instantly in their accounts. Even here it still makes sense in my mind to take an incredibly tiny hit on the miner fees because the business still benefits more from a sale involving Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:52:31

@_date: 2013-03-25 15:06:00
Ok, starting from the issue of sheer scale, you're probably right to a degree. The US dollar is ubiquitous while the bitcoin is technically "underground" which means that bitcoin needs to gain some serious attention before it becomes a viable competitor. 
On the other hand, I think bitcoin has the advantage that it is so easy to transfer. Normally if I wanted to do a long distance money transfer I'd have to get a wire transfer (at great cost) or send a check (which travels as fast as a postal service allows). Bitcoin, however, lets me send money directly from my wallet to yours for less than postage.
Also, by being decentralized, bitcoin is a hydra. You can't attack a single portion and destroy the system. You could attack mining pools or businesses, but that would just push them to use TOR. 
The initial reaction people would have is "But if I can't transfer bitcoin to cash, it's worthless..." Except bitcoin doesn't need a cash value to have value. I don't feel like going into basic economics, but BTC isn't dependent on the dollar or any other currency for value.
Best case scenario, the powers that be see how useful BTC is and employ it as a secondary currency. Intelligent bankers ought to latch onto BTC because it offers them more security than regular credit systems, can't be over drafted, or double spent. Then again bankers tend to act like idiots so who knows.

Nothing says you need to buy a full bitcoin, so I'd say take what you already have and buy what you can (that's just me though). We have no way of knowing where the price will be at any point in the future, so now is as good a time as any really.
Now, as a matter of personal opinion and prediction, I'd say it is completely reasonable to expect prices to go up and stay up. Key reasons being BitcoinFriday is coming up and plenty of us would like to buy gifts, then also Christmas/Hanukkah is coming up and many of us are going to give bitcoins as presents to people, hell, some people might buy around New Years as well. I can't say where I'd place the price, exactly, but I imagine it'll land between $700-$1000 soon. So, based on some random internet guys predictions, now's a better time to buy than later.

One thing I think we have in our favor is shear logistics of tracking coins around. I mean, imagine the US gov trying to track every bill and coin in circulation; it's unfeasible. I can only hope that the network load we could create would outstrip the ability of Coin Validation to keep up. That is, at least we could try to make their scheme so cost inefficient that they're forced to abandon everything altogether.

All I've gathered is someone offloaded a shitload of coins all at once and it crashed GOX, but I'm not 100% sure that's the exact case. 
I think a mix of things happened recently, and it's been a domino effect. I would say the start of all this was the massive, sudden skyrocketing in price recently. People then started dumping their coins to make a quick buck. From that point I think some less savvy investors got scared because they bought in around the peak and the value suddenly dropped, so they panic sold without thinking about how the price can easily go back up to where they bought in over time. Now I think the market is really correcting to where it *should be* in relation to its recent steady climb.
Now, in MY mind, I'm choosing to really ignore what's happening because it was the result of some poor thinking. I don't think Bitcoin is damaged or that we won't recover, just that some people got a little too excited and made irrational decisions. I'd still wager that we'll end the year above $400, and that in a month or so we'll look back at this just like the spike in April.

If it's possible, try to coordinate efforts with local Bitcoin sellers to be nearby if a customer wants to buy Bitcoins to try this out. I mean, hell, if I had a lot a spare coins I wouldn't mind sitting around someone's diner for a few hours if it meant bringing people into our community. The idea is to improve the market's function by doing what that Vancouver ATM does; offer Bitcoins on location so customers can buy the Bitcoins then buy their coffee/hotdog/whatever with them all in the span of minutes. I say this because allowing a merchant to accept Bitcoins is only a portion of the process, people need to be spending them to make it worth the merchant's investment.
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:27:53
That's an oversimplification though. They can't possibly know specifically where any particular bill is at any given time. The money I withdrew from an ATM might have been spent at Burger King, then used to make change, which then went to some weed dealer. I mean, there could be any number of degrees of separation from the bank to wherever the note is currently. And what if a note gets exchanged for coins? Those aren't marked and are essentially indistinguishable from one another once you have more than just a handful of them. 
My point here is that with as divisible as a single Bitcoin is, eventually the sum of all the individual parts becomes too massive to track easily. Go on blockchain.info and fool around with trying to follow a coin back to its creation, or try to follow the branching web a single coin makes as it passes from wallet to wallet and is divided up over time. The amount of computing power required to track every single satoshi must be immense considering the number of issued bitcoins currently in existence, therefore this Coin Validation idea seems like it'd be a moneypit.
Although, I must admit, I wouldn't mind being on the receiving end of massive amounts of money being spent on such a Sisyphean task. That's probably the core concept behind Coin Validation; to receive millions, if not billions, of government dollars to build something that's just not very feasible.

I've used Coinbase for all my bitcoin purchases and I like them a lot. I'd recommend Coinbase to anyone who wants to jump right in and buy small quantities with ease. Coinbase isn't set up for someone to sign up and then buy tens of BTC the same day, that's something exchanges are better for. Coinbase is, however, a good launchpad for someone who wants to buy or sell BTC at a fixed price rather than deal with an exchange where you have a lot of wiggle room but less guarantee of getting the price you want. Also, Coinbase is good for merchant services, although if you want to be a merchant you ought to look at the group of companies providing merch services.
The thing that I think is tripping some people up is that they don't have a record of large transfers at their bank so they get flagged when they make a large transfer. I mean, if you routinely spend under $100 in your day to day transactions then suddenly you're account is trying to transfer several hundred or several thousand dollars, of course it looks suspicious. I think most people aren't really considering the fact that their bank is trying to do them (and the bank itself) a favor by blocking a several thousand dollar transfer when it doesn't fit the normal pattern. Well, the "They flagged my buy" seems the most common complaint at least, so I think that complaint with Coinbase is a simple misunderstanding rather than a major issue like what happened with Instawallet.

Well, we know a key benefit bitcoin offers is the small transaction fees. So as a business if I accept Visa I lose 3 to 5 percent of each transaction, but with bitcoin it'd be fractions of a cent for most transactions. In this case a business could effectively shrug off the miner costs because they're comparatively tiny. Hell, I would imagine that a company such as Wal-Mart, if they ate the miner fees, would probably lose only tens or hundreds of dollars a month compared to the obvious thousands that Visa and MC charge them.

I agree that we need some positive marketing out there to combat all the misinformation and disinformation floating around. However, ad space is expensive, and I don't think anyone right now has the capital to place an ad in a high visibility setting. We're in a "Word-of-mouth" phase right now, and we're certainly growing our community at a fairly steady pace, which is really good for the time being. 
One of the major problems with Bitcoin reaching public adoption is that Bitcoin is currently too complex for Average Joe to really latch onto. If you look back at the early days of the internet things were fairly complicated. It took YEARS before the internet became user-friendly and saw widespread adoption. What we ultimately need is an AOL of Bitcoin; a platform where a broad audience can navigate Bitcoin with relative ease. It may take a very generous Bitcoiner to send free paper wallets loaded with fractions of Bitcoins out into the public space so people can try this out, just like AOL did with all the disks that could be found practically anywhere.

I honestly don't know anything about that, I'm just thinking about China as a driving force in the bitcoin world. 
I suppose I could speculate on the figures, but I've only taken a cursory look around on this topic. If you look at the price charts for BTC [here]( you'll see there was a large leap between the 4th and the 24th (Which I'm sure we're all aware of). Anyways, the major exchanges saw a jump in transaction volume around that time, as with any major market change. In the past month BTC trading in China has ramped up significantly, but the charts don't show numbers for the volume of trades. In fact, it looks like some recent trading activity in China shows around 28k BTC being transferred around in the past 24hrs (at the time I wrote this). Hell, they're around 10k BTC higher than all US Dollar transactions. So I suppose the percentage figures relating to China are believable at this time, if not higher than what we see.
Ultimately it looks like the Chinese are becoming a driving force behind recent bitcoin prices. They're trading in larger volumes than pretty much all other groups combined (give or take), and they're likely to keep that up based on the recent month's figures. 
Also, not paying any extra fees would be very enticing to large quantity traders, if that's the case. As for bots, (I'm assuming the kind that buy and sell at fixed rates) those were probably very heavily used as well. In fact, programs for buying and selling are used in pretty much any exchange, I'm sure. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:12:20
TL;DR Attempting to fractional reserve Bitcoins would cripple banks almost instantly because the system is transparent and immutable.
There is a very key difference here that I think is slipping through the cracks. While it would *technically* be possible for a bank to attempt to do a fractional reserve with Bitcoins, they'd crash and burn fairly quickly. 
Look at it like this, the bank takes my deposit of 100btc and keeps 10btc in my account for quick access, then they issue out the remaining 90btc as loans. Now, say I choose to withdraw my full 100btc because I want to buy two new houses; the bank is now forced to buy the 90btc that it lent out to cover my withdrawal. In the time between my deposit and my withdrawal, lets say the price rose $10 per coin, which effectively just cost the bank $900 ON TOP of the initial market value of my deposit. Even a tiny portion of clients withdrawing their Bitcoins would be instantly catastrophic to the bank. Then, the real kicker is that NO ONE will be able to repay large Bitcoin loans because of the price fluctuations. So, the bank loaned out Bitcoins that no one can feasibly repay, then they're also covering the cost of buy Bitcoins to cash out withdrawals made. It's just not economically possible to survive doing any kind of Bitcoin fractional reserve.
Let's also keep in mind what would happen if banks started attempting to issue Bitcoins the way they issue fiat. We have a hard limit of 21m btc unless someone changes the source code to mint more. First of all, there is no incentive to play that game with Bitcoin because we already know the effect printing money has on an economy. Secondly, if someone chose to increase the limit of coins, the majority of savvy users would quickly switch to the most reputable alt-coin. Anyways, anyone could take a quick look at the ledger and see that there are only *n* of Bitcoins actually existing, and the banks are reporting a much higher number. We would instantly KNOW that the banks don't ACTUALLY have the assets to back their records, and these banks would probably meet some pretty ugly ends at the hands of crowds of people who just lost their entire savings.

Okay, all the "Bubble" talk is getting trite. One of the key flaws behind a lot of the discussion is a misunderstanding of a part of what causes bubbles. So, the part that seems common in many bubbles is that the investors don't have any real confidence in the product, but buy for the sole purpose of getting a return on the investment. Dubai's real estate market is a perfect example of this problem, where buildings are bought and sold several times a day with no one ever moving into them. The investors have no desire to use the buildings as anything more than a means to make a quick buck. It's been a while since I paid any attention to that issue, so it may have already collapsed. 
Anyways, in regards to Bitcoin, there are people like me who are interested in Bitcoin's use as a tool, and therefore it will always maintain a non-zero value. Besides, so long as there are people who believe in their investment, and aren't simply trying to flip assets, then this won't be a bubble.
Lastly, the key reason people keep spouting "It's a bubble" is because it's hard to see such massive growth in a short period as being a normal thing. Also, there was the Dot Com bubble years ago, and yet the internet survived. Go figure, right?
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:30:39
Right, and I'm fine with the fees too, but I'm thinking about how future users will react. You and I have more knowledge of the inner workings of Bitcoin and we understand what the fees are for, how it's to our benefit to include them, how we can structure our transfers around the fees if needed, etc.
But Average Joe isn't going to care about those things, he just wants to use Bitcoin the way he would use a debit card, and if you constantly pop messages up about transaction fees he might get frustrated. That or he'll start in with the whole "That was supposed to only cost 0.1btc, why do I have to pay an additional 0.00005 on top of that?!" and then we lose a user.

Hell, even if we managed to spread around $1 or $5 paper wallets I think we'd get people interested. Especially if they see that their dollar slowly becomes $1.25 or $1.50 they'd definitely want to know more. I'd attach a little sticky note with  to it so if the coin amount is written on the paper wallet they'll be able to check what that amount is worth easily.

@_date: 2013-11-02 11:57:20
Well, that does have it's pro's and con's, but one major upside I can think of is that this may spur some international business being conducted with BTC. China is a huge importer and exporter, which means a LOT of business goes through China. If the Chinese can get some of their larger corporations to toy with BTC then we may see adoption spread like wildfire. I mean, we all know how cost effective large transfers of BTC are, that the bitcoin network can likely do those transfers as fast or faster than wire transfer services, and how easy it can be to convert btc to fiat.
Another upside is a potential drop in BTC price. Now bear with me because this initially seems destructive. So, if China screws things up, they'll initially raise BTC price by buying up large quantities, BUT if that bubble bursts and there's the inherent panic selling, China may flood the market with inexpensive BTC for everyone else to buy up and use. Keep in mind that every bubble we've had has always stabilized back to a HIGHER price than when the bubble started, so the Chinese bubbling BTC could actually be of massive benefit long term as well.
The third potential upside to this is how it could drive technology. The Chinese might turn to creating cheap but powerful ASICs to mine BTC. There are three parts of this I like: we may see cheap mining hardware become available to consumers; hardware innovation obviously fits in here; and this could fuel our btc economy.
One last thought I have is that the Chinese government may lay some groundwork for the legal issues facing BTC. Granted this has the potential to drive BTC in extremes such as fueling anti-bitcoin lawmaking, or (if we're lucky) China may welcome bitcoin into its economy and that would lead to the US following suit. Obviously a lot of US business is conducted with China, and China could dictate the future of that realm. Basically, the hope here is for a pro-bitcoin Chinese gvt which would push any country conducting business with the Chinese to favor btc as well.
TL;DR: Basically I think we do want China to speculate and/or invest now as it may improve things greatly for btc overall.

Companies forged within the Bitcoin community don't scare me, I believe that we can trust them based on common interests. It's just that I'm dreading the day I see "Deposit Bitcoins here!" signs at the local Bank of America, or Wells Fargo, or what have you. 
Basically I'm scared a modern bank would: attempt to do fractional reserve with Bitcoins; obfuscate or never divulge the real address of your Bitcoin account; completely botch the lending process by borrowing against a Bitcoin based on its exchange value; and many of the other practices that got us to the point where we NEED Bitcoin in the first place.
The average citizen likely won't understand Bitcoin very well, and like most average citizens they'll think the bank is their friend and is offering them a better Bitcoin service. So I'm hoping companies like Coinbase, BitPay, and CoinKite will be able to advertise long before banks decide to offer (potentially harmful) Bitcoin related services.
EDIT: I'm not saying banks can really harm Bitcoin (aside from trying to regulate it away), but that by them misusing Bitcoins they could cause other economic damage.

If SHTF then your fiat is probably worth squat too. Much of fiat is tied up in banking systems that create money by typing numbers into people's accounts. If the banking systems get fried by the same thing frying your home computer, then the local government is gonna be thoroughly destabilized. 
If you want something of value to be able to trade in a worst-case scenario then invest in guns and ammo because no one is going to give a shit about gold or silver when there aren't any industries functioning enough to use them. So, again, guns and ammo because they have extremely high use-value in those situations.

The metal, IDK how I feel about litecoin yet. Silver though is portable, transferable, and has a slightly more stable history (until a few weeks back it was fine). Litecoin may or may not prove as useful as BTC.

No, I'm arguing for a simple UI that the average person can use and understand without having to research miner fees. The idea I'm presenting is opt-in and requires both parties to accept the terms. It's not about me personally dodging the fees, it's about making bitcoin low-experience user friendly.

That still beats the 3% to 5% credit card companies take. It is slightly more than what PayPal takes as their cut, though, which is only 1%.

Within a vacuum, I'd say a purely Bitcoin economy is feasible. Unfortunately, we don't live inside a vacuum. If a society were to operate solely off Bitcoin as its money system, it would likely be very similar to how people live(d) without credit. You can't really issue credit based off Bitcoin because you can't manipulate it the way fiat can be manipulated. Ultimately, I think that a purely Bitcoin economy would require a great deal of effort to keep running.
I mean, there's a reason the US moved from the Gold Standard to the Federal Reserve, and that's because Gold backed currency has a fixed supply which prevents a government from spending like crazy. And let's face it, governments love spending money, sometimes it's necessary like for infrastructure, and sometimes it's purely frivolous like finding inventive new ways to blow up other people.

Actually, I think Coin Validation has a linchpin or two we could pull if we needed to and one would be by dividing individual transactions into many many smaller transactions. It would be a pain in the ass and it would cost a lot in transaction fees, but the idea would be that by creating a larger volume of transactions we increase the amount of effort involved in tracing the coin around. I think of this as being similar to tearing up a dollar bill; you *could* put that dollar bill back together, but it would take considerable effort to do so. Next is that if it's several dollar bills all ripped up the process gets increasingly more difficult. The ultimate goal here is to create such an immense load on Coin Validation's side that they'd need to sink an impractical amount of work/money to keep up.

Good point.
I suppose the only initial thought I can offer is that we'd have to essentially vote with our Bitcoins. I don't know if you have Valero gas stations in your area, but they charge a fee for all debit card transactions. I simply choose not to go to Valero often because I don't want to pay that added fee. If it got to the point that a large retailer such as Wal-Mart chose to impose that charge, then I guess we'd have to find another idea or just deal with it. However, this does really fit into "business as usual" for a lot of companies and I think it'd kinda be just a dick move to pass the miner fee off onto customers. I mean, if you went to a store and they said, "Oh, you're paying with Visa? We need to add another 5% to your transaction," you'd probably not shop there often.
However, I think the main use of this might be for remittances. Basically implementing this or something like it would streamline the UI for people who aren't very tech/bitcoin savvy. You know, just something more user friendly.
Edit: I don't want to sound like current merchants are dicks if the miner fee is added to all their transactions. I'm looking more towards the future when more people use bitcoins.

Yeah, I didn't really understand it until that article, but let's debate this a little. Let's say someone is really that hellbent on ruining bitcoin, there are a few initial problems I can foresee. First is that bitcoin's network could be modified to exist outside the attack. Second is that smart ASIC suppliers would block the attempt to shut down their businesses when someone tries to dismantle their buyer base. Third is that new coin types would make a continued attack extraordinarily expensive by requiring an attacker to attack multiple networks, simultaneously, and continuously. And lastly, if hacktivists found who was responsible... well, I doubt they'd be attacking for long.  
Anyways, I more or less started from the idea that any attempt against bitcoin is impractical, the 51% seems to be even more impractical and yields next to no real reward for the effort. I guess in my mind this attack is the equivalent of punching at waves on a beach, the waves will either knock you over or find a way around. Might as well just not spend the energy.
@_date: 2013-11-17 07:35:01
Yeah, but I'm concerned that equating Bitcoin to purely Libertarian ideals is going to stymie growth. We need to be more than a subset of Libertarians, we need to be able to gather conservatives and liberals without trying to be too much of one or the other. I mean, I'm a Libertarian Socialist realistically, Anarcho-Communist ideally, and I vote more like a Democrat because I think we ought to iron out social issues then work later to contract their cost; so I technically don't fit under the classic American libertarian ideology. Point is that we should really rout out individual politicians based on where they stand with Bitcoin rather than fund a party that may or may not agree with our community.

I'm just gonna stick to what I have rather than try to day-trade. In fact, I see the day-traders as somewhat of a hindrance to our goals because they constantly create volatility when we need stability. Many companies who were looking at Bitcoin in the past few weeks and were sitting on the fence likely got concerned, and may take even longer to get in the game. Sure, the price stabilized and is still up from where it's been, but no one is likely to risk their livelihood on accepting a money that looks like it could sink them into serious debt overnight. I mean, people like OP and several others here know these price spikes aren't the end of the world, but a business owner would likely still see the spike and drop as a massive risk. 
There are plenty of people who probably have good reason to go crazy and try to cash out, and maybe they need the cash badly, but in terms of spreading Bitcoin into mainstream business use this just slows us down. Remember, Bitcoin won't succeed as anything more than "magic internet money" unless we get businesses to opt-in, so we need to stop treating Bitcoin like a get rich quick scheme and more like a proper payment tool.

Man, there's an ENTIRE book worth of history leading up to 9/11. A quick run down is: The West picks the first fight with communism; the Soviets take over Russia; America involves itself in needless bloodshed; the USSR moves into Afghanistan because of some good reasons; the US funds the Muj but stabs them in the back once the USSR pulls out; bin Laden is irked by the US treating the Muj  and Afghan people as disposable, he also sees the US military isn't as mighty as it pretends to be; as retribution for America's arrogance and mistreatment of Arabs, bin Laden and al-Qaeda orchestrate 9/11. The key message that we were SUPPOSED to get? "Stop fucking the people of the world over for economic interests"
Anyways, now I wouldn't be surprised if some fucknut politician claims Bitcoin funds al-Qaeda.

Yeah... Unfortunately it does seem that a lot of Americans think that America can and should try to run the world.
And, honestly, I think a lot of the strife surrounding CoinValidation right now is based around the fact that they are proudly trying to violate one of the key concepts behind Bitcoin. I'm not sure many of us take them too seriously because they're proposing to do something that's just not very feasible, but at the same time we're aware of the implications of their actions. Basically it boils down to CoinValidation trying to open the proverbial floodgates to everything this community doesn't want to have happen.
