Vewy Niceee
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:11:50
uh.. I don't understand what's happening in that sub
what is churning anyway?
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:39:14
more like if there's a party has more than 50% hash power
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:49:23
except Uber and AirBnB has been called off for a long time for unfair business practices
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:12:38
Question : what happen if someone accidentally transfered BTC to BCH address?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:42:44
So have you visited moon now?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:52:45
one thing I love after 9k price is that because of the fluctuation of new users, the post about bcash and r/btc become less visible
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:47:35
I don't understand a single things you blabbered about
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:03:31
I'm still trying to process how "short" and "long" strategy work. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:53:49
first visited this sub around 2013-2014. it was so very different back then. lot of tech geeks were around lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:50:29
financial DNS?
huh? can you elaborate more on that?
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:44:35
and this is why I don't want to touch derivative market.
it's pure gambling
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:03:13
I am a programmer
the content of this sub was very different back in 2013-2014
it was all very very very technical talks. I dunno where those guys gone now
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:46:49
huh there's korea ban bitcoin rumor out there?
@_date: 2014-04-12 09:10:54
I need to double check that I am actually in @_date: 2017-08-27 14:27:28
Litecoin is Bitcoin's good little brother
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:37:33
welp too bad exodus doesn't allow me to set my own fee :(
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:34:31
that means the next few days we will see it correcting again
probably around $2800
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:43:58
BOOM ! Comment dropped
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:04:44
hmm so..
1) move all my bitcoin to another address first
2) export the old private keys to electron cash
3) get my BCH
4) profit?
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:18:25
will exodus reduce BTC fee. still getting 486 sat/byte :(
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:07:09
I would switch to LTC, not BCH.. those are stupid move :/
@_date: 2017-08-30 07:21:18
I guess I need to move my bitcoin to another wallet that support custom fees then, exodus is sucks on this thing. .__.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:59:36
yeah so sad looking at the denial there :(
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:06:28
that can be done with simple googling :|
or open coinmarketcap.com
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:39:30
non american here
so IRS can practically do anything with what you own? 
how come?
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:18:15
purchased some BTC when everyone panick sell before 1 August. it's almost 250% now lol
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:54:37
well you can say the same thing with litecoin
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:58:28
I'm so happy I bought BTC when it was $1900 . lol
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:26:27
yep I can get it from the wallet. and?
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:47:08


I still see the fee high enough for me to do any transaction . will it ever reach below $1? .___.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:52:11
can you tell me how to get my BCH with electron cash?
I use exodus currently
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:25:53
so is the censorship a real thing here? kinda spectical for btc for that :|
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:51:33
I use exodus and I cannot choose the transaction fee :'(
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:34:11
stable currency is the best place to keep safe your money
of course it's rising high right now, but who knows how far it will crash in the future.
I believe market correction will happen soon
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:05:44
and now we face the tyranny of transaction fee :( 
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:28:34
I purchased when it crashed around $1800-1900
it practically doubled now. so happy :')
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:46:41
something that I see almost rarely mentioned anymore . I missed the old day where the discussion was all about what cryptocurrency can do as a currency 
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:38:07
Inb4 people keep saying "don't buy today it will dip higher" when the price crashed. 
I guess just don't buy too much to avoid damage for now
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:31:24
I suddenly remember that when [THIS] ( meme posted the next day bitcoin will crash. lol
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:11:54
what a world we live in today!
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:43:31
funny , the fee shown on my exodus is getting pricier now :/
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:49:53
you HODL that meme well
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:12:10
If you do not have license for financial advisor I would not suggest you tell your friend to spend money on something risky
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:42:08
this become too scary O.o
I already moved some of my coin to litecoin for now
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:39:14
At this current state I think it's a point of no return anymore. bitcoin will always be digital asset
which beg the question.. what's its intrinsic value? :|
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:05:48
I only care about [coinmarketcap.com] ( price
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:15:58
I must thank you that because of people like you we reached 8K. :')
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:54:17
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:54:04
stability, less drama and politics, segwit, lightning network, 5th biggest (6th now because Dash sudden increase in price), bigger space, faster confirmation time, cheaper fee, etc etc
I always found it funny when they say people will abandon BTC for BCH, because litecoin is definitely better
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:00:34
legit drunk post over here. lol
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:46:40
this is some crazy link aggregation

dude.. learn to format
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:59:36
congratulations. :)
I am curious how do you buy and sell bitcoin there
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:53:21
best time to buy is when the price is stable
at least it work for me when buying LTC
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:52:00
Wanna try our new szechuan sauce dip?
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:57:57
someone should post this to r/bestof
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:59:42
there's always small dip every here and then
but if you expect 40% dip don't hope too much 
even when it happen I don't think people saying "I will wait for the next dip" will be brave enough to enter . lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:19:32
you clearly haven't been long enough here to see people burning out because they panic sell
that's what the HODL actually addressing. 
believe in the coin value, don't panic sell just because the price went down temporarily
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:12:23
and store 2 can be LTC or any other coin outside of BCH
so no that analogy doesn't work
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:50:24
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:47:41
pssst... hey kid.
wanna try litecoin? ;)
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:05:10
your definition of risk is weird then
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:59:05
you're underestimating the amount of teenager here
I bet all these post were made by young people :
* price memes 
* naive comment saying people was stupid for spending bitcoin to buy pizza. 
* complaining post about price not moving fast enough/panic selling etc
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:52:53
Are you linus tech tips???
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:07:00
cofveve $5
fee $13
so... yeah
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:42:11
I would remind myself that being too optimistic about things is always a bad thing.
So yeah better be worry and have a backup plan :) 
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:51:21
at first I thought it was like those browser miner thing
but after reread turns out you're getting paid for it
but what would cpu and hard disk used for?
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:56:08
here we see the birth of Bitcoin Ultra Instinct! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:48:10
purchased when it "crashed" to $1800 pre August Segwit. 500% increase. so happy :)
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:46:26
this is some quality level shit
awesome lol
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:46:11
go search Mt.Gox 
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:12:58
who is "this guy" you mentioned about?
@_date: 2018-03-04 13:48:13
you missed the invisible /s buddy
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:22:54
and no one know the name?
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:15:24
at this point we're just being semantics
@_date: 2018-03-04 13:46:12
Is this the komodo thing?
I tried that before and looks very empty
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:08:53
username checkout
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:52:25
will this affect Mac?
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:44:03
again. semantics. I believe what they mean is they're not relying too much on outside power supply or something
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:22:04
what app do you use to do lightning transaction?
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:04:19
what is hot and cold storage if I may ask?
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:47:41
sounds like conspiracist
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:35:51
uh.. will this be a new trend?
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:27:14
I don't think we need to go that far
It's like asking about email to postman in 90s
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:18:46
lol'd at wannacry ransom. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:45:13
with the note that that country has at least bitcoin exchange for convenience
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:36:36
the fuss is if every other sites follow this monetization model and everytime I open web browser my CPU is getting eaten by those invisible miners. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:32:47
like.. showing image or gifs? how much that would cost?
of course it's different story for intrusive ads. I always block that shit
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:51:49
must be r/dogecoin shibe 
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:48:28
did you invest in btc only or spread it across multiple coin?
@_date: 2018-03-04 13:51:50
first, you misspelled coinmarketcap
and yeah 24h change literally means the price difference between now and previous 24 h
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:01:06
to pay back the loan?
I don't know how loan works tho. lol
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:05:17
got no space for those full blockchain tho
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:38:45
exodus still using recommended fee set by bitcoinfees.earn.com which is around 160-200 sat/b
still waiting for the fee to go down to move my btc to my ledger nano :(
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:06:14
it need 40-50GB bandwidth daily to run bitcoin node?
like.. whaaaaat
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:00:13
bitcoin sub talking about spaceX and NASA deeply. I am impressed O.o
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:56:10

@_date: 2018-02-16 01:55:15
username checkout
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:59:48
why I didn't think of that. dang. lol
what desktop wallet that support custom fees?
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:38:40
So japanese are okay with high fee? O.o
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:49:18
But how? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:03:05
what is leverage?
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:53:46
always down on weekend and up again on weekdays these past 3 weeks.
too tiring watching the price I started to ignore it now. lol
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:59:57
it's just recycling, reducing waste and maximizing throughput. nothing really against the law of physics
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:39:26
if you create value with that computer (e.g : getting a job as programmer, being a designer, created a games, etc) I don't think it's a bad investment
if you only use it for playing game  and browsing internet in the other hand....
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:57:54
But I made -50% in BCH :( 
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:18:36
the question is : can he liquidate his bitcoin to fiat?
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:08:09
can someone ELI5 me what is this "future contract" means?
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:25:04
that's totally FOMO
you're gonna playing with fire
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:52:44
that's not good advice if they just want to invest and not trade
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:27:54
well we can't say one of the most rich individual in the world is stupid. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:24:35
I think this is a bit outdated
Humble bundle has been long since taken off their bitcoin payment
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:36:53
the sad truth is , from current position if it ever goes under $3000 it will keep going down until $2000 or lower. I'm not sure you will keep hodling lol
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:27:42
to think that the only way to enter the cryptocoin world is through a very political heavy coin like this.. (at least for my country)
I start to lose hope for crypto coin.
I hope more exchange start accepting USD to LTC vice versa
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:08:56
what prevent government from blocking exchanges from accepting bitcoin from wikileaks address?
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:58:21
many people didn't think rationally that in volatile market when something goes down hard it can also goes up higher in the future
especially when the fundamental isn't broken
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:03:28
this is why I hate bitcoin and eth subs
full of hodler and anti hodler without much too add to conversation
typical get rich quick schemer. these kind of guys will not stay long in the field . .___.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:34:43
HODL is cryptocurrency slang language for "HOLD" . practically keeping your asset when it's value currently decreasing instead of selling it. hoping that it will go up again in the future
and then there's this kind of guy bragging about "timing the market" 
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:38:55
I feel like I can't really believe both parties because all these conflicting facts
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:11:42
where do you live and what can you buy with bitcoin there?
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:00:47
agree. that &gt; $2 makes me think twice for spending btc . lol
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:00:58
I feel like this is sarcastic post
but if it's not, well I'm sorry for you OP. rule number one in cryptocurrency subs is never listen to buy and sell comment. lol
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:48:40
Imagine the epic crash that will come with it
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:26:49
Isn't stable price actually good?
IF only people use bitcoin more for payment system than investment instrument
but again with current fee it's not a great tool for transaction anymore. If the trend continue it will slowly become monkey business
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:13:17
aah I see. I thought it was because of that Segwit-something implemented 
anyway will the transaction fee ever comes down to $1 or less ? It really kills the premise of bitcoin as "payment system alternative" for me.. :/
@_date: 2017-06-28 13:27:53
I don't even know what onecoin is
@_date: 2017-06-26 05:43:28
what is sat/b?
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:47:04
nah. dogecoin will rule the world
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:24:52
purchased mine when it was around 2400
but quickly converted it to ethereum. like 50% of it . lol
@_date: 2017-06-26 09:33:44
what determine the size of input? O.o
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:45:03
Uuuuh. so if I bought bitcoin in small amount in a long time it will cost me a lot of transaction fee in the long run?
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:32:23
well unfortunately Coinbase doesn't support my country. There's like only one bitcoin exchange here 
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:35:48
uuum... 
I'm more talking about the wallet here. aren't we supposed to have wallet before starting transaction?
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:39:15
wow thanks guys!
Regardless of the mixed solution I am still grateful that I learned a lot by reading all your answer.
someone even pm'ed me about exodus
I will look at your suggestions
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:00:50
currently I don't hold very much bitcoin. 
I only have it to buy another cryptocoin, mainly ethereum. because that's the only way to buy ethereum currently
but if you ask me what I use cryptocoin for , currently I still buy it for investment
but I still hoping that I can buy things with cryptocoins because it looks so convenient
sadly enough that part of cryptocoin doesn't as developed as the investment part, or worse yet declining. People almost forgot that bitcoin meant to be used as money. Even humblebundle now disable their bitcoin payment :/
Edit : sorry, my grammar sucks .___.
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:04:33
can someone ELI5 me why the transaction fee is reduced?
@_date: 2017-06-25 04:05:50
Ugh. and it's holiday here in my country. the exchange is closed.
damn :(
Edit : by closed I mean they will not verify deposit until workday. lol
