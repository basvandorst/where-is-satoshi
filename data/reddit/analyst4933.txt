Actually, it's entirely possible that such a vehicle could protect you from 2% annual inflation, provided that this level of volatility is preserved over the system and that the result is a wash. 
You're right, though, with the $800 buy-point. But sillier still than the "because inflation" answer is the "one still has 1/21 million bitcoin!" argument. Given that prices are quoted in USD/EUR/JPY et cet, it's not at all clear what one stands to gain by that fact.

I'm aware of the difference, but "seems fairly settled" is the concept I'm having trouble with; especially when it's applied, as it is in this instance, to the field of economics. Normally, I'm not a hard science snob, but I think anyone who *really understands anything* about economics (see what I did there?) recognizes that the field is a work in progress. This is, after all, the field that awarded Nobels to Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert J. Shiller in the same year without blinking an eye at the inherent contradiction. Even if the foundations of Keynesian economics were as rock solid as the Theory of Evolution, I believe Kuhn's observation that knowledge proceeds one funeral at a time would still apply. More to the point might be Keynes' own observation that "Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.”

"No, it does not set fiscal policy, but Yellen especially repeatedly talks about how QE is necessary for job creation for the poor."
*Was* necessary, and yes, it was. Plummeting share price = layoffs. 
"Absolutely correct. Inflation drives down the value of debt. The biggest debtor is the US government."
Most of that money is money the US government owes itself. 
"The Fed is not tied directly to the tax payer, but it is a fair call to say that QE and ZIRP favour the wealthy over the poor. QE especially has provided huge liquidity to the stockmarket, driving it up. Even the BoE has stated that QE benefits the wealthy most of all."
That's largely because most of them didn't sell stock in order to repair damaged balance sheets and pay down debt. So what?
"Inflation only occurs when money gets some velocity, which obviously it hasn't (yet). The fact is that the money was created to purchase financial instruments - debt - owned overwhelmingly by the wealthy." 
In the sense that the wealthy own stock in banks, this is so. Again, so what?

:Plummeting earnings = layoffs. :
You keep repeating that as if repeating something made it true. The earnings plummeting because of a rapid decrease in consumer spending and the rapid decrease in consumer spending was due to plummeting stock prices and correspondingly high debt levels. 
Yes, ultimately it all comes back to earnings, but as the stock market discounts *expected* future earnings back to the present and the drop in those equity valuations was a key driver of demand contraction, the result was a self-fulfilling prophecy.

"Plummeting sales = layoffs. "
Sales were plummeting because people were all hoarding cash at the same time in an attempt to repair their balance sheets. That, in turn, led to reduced hours and plummeting stock prices, which in turn led to layoffs. You can't toss out the effect of collapsed equity prices. Had the stock market not tanked, people would have had (or at least felt that they had) the $ to weather the downturn. 
"Plummeting share price will make stock investors (i.e. the rich) feel poorer, so maybe they'll sell fewer Rolexes"
Luxury was the first thing to crash in 2008 = No luxury buyers for those Rolexes. 
"but the rich don't purchase goods in proportion to their wealth."
"Poorer households have more of their wealth in their house and in cash."
"Doesn't matter who is owed - they are obligated to pay them back just the same as with any other creditor."
I've never found this argument to be compelling. It's like saying that society is a function of money rather than vice versa. What's to prevent Jubilee legislation, or bad debts to be held to maturity (i.e. left to die via annual inflation) on the government's balance sheet? It's what the US did after WWII. Those debts weren't paid off until 1973, and by then it was a drop in the bucket.  
"Generally the government organizations that invest in treasuries need the money for future obligations, i.e. Social Security."
Right, but again, you're arguing as if the system is set in stone according to immutable economic laws when, in reality, there is no requirement to adhere to a failed system. 
"So the Fed is assisting crony capitalism, giving 0% loans to banks so they can park them in risk-free treasuries while students pay a much higher interest rate."
The FOMC doesn't care who gets rich, just as long as someone does. Yellen has departed significantly from her predecessors in even acknowledging inequality as a major problem. However, the Fed was limited by its mandate. 
Congress is the only group that could have restored the socioeconomic balance, and they lacked the political will to do so. Inasmuch as your complaint seems to be with regulatory capture of the legislature by vested interests, you have a point. But again, what else was the Fed supposed to do beyond creating demand, here?
"So the Fed is printing free wealth for 1% of the population"
Once again, the Fed was not "printing money", it was inflating asset prices by stoking demand for bonds while holding interest rates at effective zero and promising low rates in the future (i.e. extended guidance). A windfall is not the same as "printing money". The nominal figure had little and less to do with anything. The goal was to increase the velocity of money and generate a sense of prosperity in the hope that people would de-sphincter and take risks.) 
The FOMC is playing fast and loose with inflation at present because if there's anything they *know* how to do, it's how to take the air out of the economy by tightening rates. Whether or not they do so is another topic entirely.

"Inflation as we experience it is value theft"
There's no implicit promise that $1 will always and forever buy XYZ amount of goods and/or services, only that it should remain *relatively* stable, and, in fact, one is directly informed via a publicly announced and much discussed target rates of interest (i.e. key rates) as to the desired yield characteristics of the financial instruments one should use in order to preserve said purchasing power. 
Does this system penalize savers? Of course it does! That's the whole point of an inflation target, to force savers to do something more productive with their excess savings than hoard them. But no one ever promised savers shit.

On paper, that makes sense. In practice, it doesn't happen. Here's what actually happens: When the price of BTC falls, the velocity of the system increases as people offload coins (fear of loss &gt; hope for gain). Yes, when the price of BTC rises, hoarding tends to increase. But the hoarding impulse is neither infinite or automatic, many people take profits. Higher BTC prices also encourage diversification into Alt-Coins, many of which are pegged to an inflationary rather than deflationary regimes.

You're using Marc Andreessen's argument contra Picketty, but the loophole there is that he was arguing from Fund Manager's perspective. 
*However*, if you're a high net worth individual, your job isn't so much to find news sources of alpha on a day to day basis (i.e. outperforming the market) as it is to achieve average market returns at a lower beta (if possible). 
In short, if you're rich, just buy an index fund + a risk-free bond fund.

Okay, for the sake of argument, let's assume that what everyone is really talking about when they talk about Bitcoin is ultimately *gold-backed* money, since numerous projects are already in alpha testing that add additional capabilities (Colored Coins/Smart Property, Open Exchange, BitShares et al).

"In the world of gold standard every price was denoted in gold - a scarce resource, that is hard to forge, hard to come by and highly valuable for multiple of reasons (display of wealth among them). You could go to shop and ask what a price of a bread or a horse is in gold. At some point silver had similar function."
Prices were in fact denoted in national units of account which were pegged to gold and silver was the dominant unit by transaction volume. 
"One could say, that banks are cheating, if they promise to pay people more than they had. So why did people allow for it? Fact is, without such freedom, banks would not exist."
This statement implies that the existence of banks is both a necessity and an unmitigated good. No doubt the banks believe it, though I note in passing that the Hawala system works well enough without them. 
"I would say, gold standard was dead the day the credit was introduced."
Credit in the form of social IOUs was introduced prior to gold and existed parallel to
the gold standard in the form of negotiable notes written against gold. 
"Something very subtle has happened here. You made a promise and this promise started to become worth something. The shopkeeper was able to take some money from the cleaning funds and substitute them for this promise. In a way, your promise became money."
I just said that.

Look at the UBS' real focus: It was never about fees, it was about SAVINGS. UBS highlights that point over and over again. Why? Because it's a fractional reserve system and because banks have capital reserve requirements. The higher your reserves (savings), the more you can lend (mortgage bonds, corporate bonds, et cet). Those instruments are then repackaged into mezzanine debt (warrants, credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations) and resold to investors. Bitcoin pays no interest on savings; therefore it's disruptive potential is limited to remittance and some 3rd world basket case dismediation.

If "bitcoin is gunpowder" then it's the early 11th century low-saltpeter/imperfect nitrate Chinese formula rather than modern, shock and awe variety. I suppose iron was better than earlier copper/bronze weapons and vessels in various ways; but "bitcoin is (more like) steel" would have been more in line with the "revolutionary" bit; steam engines were pretty much application specific; and IBM's PC architecture got jacked. 
Also, all the things that Bitcoin "isn't" - MySpace, Netscape Navigator, the iPhone - made a relatively small number of people a large amount of money, while the paradigm shifts (i.e. gunpowder, iron, steam engines, et cet) made a relatively large number of people a living and not much else.

Crammed in at the last minute before the state House went into recess, the measures were part of a broader series of amendments that legally recognized any number of records being stored on a blockchain.
While details regarding the vote are still emerging, the director of the Global Delaware state initiative, Andrea Tinianow, described the news in an email to CoinDesk:
"Now, you have something to [write] about!!! History being made."

"Believe you mean "worth more" here?"
Just so! 
As I indicated in my reply to greenearplugs above, perhaps there's a way for certain merchants to work around the deflationary bias in such a way that would induce currency speculators to spend. The "will program for Bitcoin" crowd appear to be doing quite well, precisely because they're dependent upon time and mental effort, rather than commodities. Thinking: Collectibles (A large market that is highly dependent on centralized sales outlets with onerously high fees at present) by way of offering asset/investment diversification? Or why not the art market? Same difficulties, same relief from high input costs.  
The upshot here is that bitcoin might not have to be good for *everything*, it may be enough to be good enough for *some* things, especially if those things present their own off-Wall Street/centralized control investment dynamics.

That's the common public perception and it's one G.S.'s PR works night and day to instill. Now what's the reality? The reality is that Goldman got too "hot", had to ditch half of its operations and switch to being a low-cost financial services provider, and now Blackrock is the top dog in corporate America, with a beneficial interest in roughly 1/4 of all publicly listed companies.

The market approved the taper because uncertainty about the taper was causing more problems than the taper itself and because the Fed is going to continue to increase the velocity of money in the system by extending something called "low forward guidance". Essentially, the bond market depends on the Fed's predictions about its own future behavior to determine the cost of fiat money, and the Fed does its damnedest not to surprise the markets unless it's an emergency. The stock market in turn depends upon the bond market. With low forward rates, the message is "we're replacing That with This, but the effect is pretty much the same assuming this works. We really aren't sure that it will, but we've run simulations." 
Result: "Let the good times roll!" Kinda. Sorta. Investors are trembling with anxiety and analysts are polarizing, but in the end, no one has any desire to Fight the Fed. "If the Fed wants stocks up, stocks will go up." There is also a feedback loop between Wall St. and the Fed, but the cable from the Fed to Wall St. carries a lot more juice. Of course, the Fed has a history of overshooting it's inflationary targets with low forward guidance. Sometimes, the Fed misses by a lot. But they'd rather fight inflation than allow more structural damage to the work force because of all the problems that will generate down the line. 
TL;DR: Low-forward guidance on key interests rates is replacing QE bond buying.

Factually also goes two ways, I need to get it right by BTC, too. One of the most common objections to bitcoin within financial circles is that it's an obvious pyramid scheme. But there's also an argument to be made that participation has turned BTC into something quite viable regardless of its origins or unknown actors. Is there any evidence for such a case? 
One argument, for example, might be that without perfect foreknowledge, it's unlikely that many of the early adopters are still holding disproportionate amounts of BTC and that the Media focus on bitcoin zero-to-fiat multimillionaires overstates the case, when in fact, such events could just be relatively low-prob/high impact. Is that a valid argument and if so, does anyone know where I can get the numbers/charts to make it?

So to the argument that bitcoin has no intrinsic value because it isn't "based on anything", the intrinsic value is "be your own micro-bank", and the answer to the objection that "well, it's an open protocol, anyone can make their own coin" would be the same as for Facebook, i.e. Network Effect.

(Source: Western Union Price Estimator)
However, no one sends $0.49 via Western Union. What would be the point? PayPal (EBAY) works reasonably well for countries like the U.S. and the Philippines, but it's less so for others, Russia and Africa. Paypal also charges a significant premium for currency conversion, a fact that may have little impact on most individuals but tends to add up in aggregate. Else equal, a payment solution that circumvents these gatekeepers will expand the rate of transactions, which makes it very difficult to call a market top.
If we can't call a top, how about a bottom? Many products have what can be thought of as a prophylactic utility, meaning that their promise is not so much in what they can do, but in what they prevent, circumvent and replace. Security systems, Swiss bank accounts, pesticides and prophylactics come readily to mind, as well as hundreds of other services. It's reasonable to assume that a floor (but not a ceiling) for such services can be established by assigning a dollar value to the price that the average person would pay for the privilege of prevention.
The global remittance market was valued at $406 billion in 2012. Assuming static levels of global remittance transfers, it's reasonable to assume that a rational individual would pay a considerable fraction of this total in order to receive more prompt service at a discount of 99% (ex confirmation fees). That amounts to slightly over $4 billion a year.

Bitcoin prevents high remittance fees, a currently $500 billion per annum market. Lower fees likely mean a higher demand for remittance services, i.e. "As these technologies mature, they eventually surpass sustaining technologies due to lower costs. The result is excess demand, as consumers will tend to use the same service much more frequently at a lower cost than at a higher cost."
Bitcoin also circumvents bank fees, in the sense that most people open checking accounts simply for the convenience of checks/debit cards/ATMs. Due to creative accounting practices on the bank's end (alternating between FIFO and LIFO, hidden opt-ins, bounced check fees, et cet), the real cost of utilizing these services can be quite high for the end user and correspondingly profitable for the banks. This is doubly onerous when you consider that "free" checking accounts are essentially a tax on the poor.

I've considered this, too, for my collectibles business. One reason I think I could manage the volatility swings (do you constantly re-peg your prices, or what?) is because the margin can be quite large if you're really good at finding diamonds that other people have mistaken for glass. The antiquities and collectibles markets, like the art market and jewelry, et cet, are highly concentrated and the fees are outrageous. BTW, I'm going to use part of your post.

If you're referring to my SA articles, I'm projecting future scenarios. Some of them are ALWAYS going to be wrong. I think I've got something like a 70-80% accuracy on calling stocks at the moment, though to be honest an all-time high market makes geniuses out everyone. (The -$1 billion impact of the H7N9 scare on Yum! Brand and McDonalds was dead-on-balls accurate, though, as was "The Myth of China's Export Economy"  
as well as my call on Intesa San Paolo, et cet.)

Isn't there an objection to signing Contracts as long as either party is exposed to volatility? 
I.E. if a person OWES in BTC, which is unpegged to  USD and 
a) borrower converts BTC into dollars in order to transact dollar-based business
b) BTC increases x10 in value relative to USD
c) Creditor comes demanding BTC
then wouldn't the horribly negative result essentially mitigate against using BTC for contracts in this way? 
BTW, this was the argument of an anti-BTC article on SA published a few months ago, I think.

"he banking ecosystem is carnivorous by nature." 
You have it, exact. In reality, groups like JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are MUCH more interested in exploiting and promoting a new asset class than they are in oligarchy, for the simple reason that it's a promotion "eat what you kill"-based system. The current regulatory push appears to be that BTC should be traded like gold. THAT is something they could probably get behind, or at least, WILL be able to get behind, as it allows the banks to say to the merchants: "High FEES? Hey, you chose the service. You want low fees, use BTC." (Mind, in this thought experiment, the banks are huge beneficiaries of BTC use as well.) 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:19:46

@_date: 2013-12-30 19:05:38
Oh, well then. That's different. 
Obviously, the first is the remittance industry, which is roughly $500 billion a year, though, as I previously stated, demand tends to increase as costs decrease. Then, there's bank fees. Customers paid $32 billion in 2012 alone. That said, not every bank customer or even a plurality of them are going to give up their trusty plastic for a financial transfer protocol that's still in Beta. 
The biggest potential market isn't Bitcoin at all, but in stacked/parallel protocols that work on/with the Bitcoin principle. For instance, Ripple --originally OpenCoin -- and protocols like it effectively eliminate the need for foreign exchange brokers. I don't have access to those reports because they're behind a paywall ( but considering how much I paid a broker at the airport to convert my GBPs back into USD, I'm willing to call it a multi-billion dollar market, sight unseen. 
But the real value is in secondary layers like Colored Coins/Master Coin, which allow for the exchange of Smart Property. (Stock trading, real estate asset transfer). Those products are also still in beta, but I'm perfectly comfortable at this time pegging BTC's price to simple remittance and capital control evasion.

But it isn't really independent of the U.S. financial system yet if the present attraction is that you can speculate in BTC to make more USD, is it? Put another way: Gold is technically "independent of the U.S. financial system" too, but the actions of U.S. banks still matter. 
I say this because I read an article in American Banker the other day against "The Bitcoin Delusion" written by a guy who was pushing "digital dollars" as the banker-friendly choice. 
And YES, that guy wears his soul on his face with all his "render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's" rhetoric, but there's the possibility that the banking community will swallow the flattering reference.

First of all, let me start by thanking the Reddit Community for the (overall) extremely positive response to my previous thread. Outreach appreciated. 
Given the relatively liquid and functional exchanges, the instant convertibility from BTC to USD and other commonly accepted units of account, the history of a steady increase in value of BTC vs. a basket of currencies as media coverage increases, an, again, relatively benign regulatory regime, the comfort of law enforcement with what is mistakenly referred to as "virtual currencies", and the resilience of the currency in question to both adverse press as well as prior crashes, my conclusion is that it would benefit the stock holders of these companies for bitcoin to be included as a payment option.
In short, why not? :) It sounds like a great way to get paid.

No, it would be VAR (value-at-risk) vis-a-vis BTC. Works like this:

2) Hey, look at all of that surprising success! 
3) Banks get pissed at that surprising success.
4) A nasty outcome like 
a) Banks pull a Mt. Gox on the $ side and someone can't pay a light bill.
b) Banks influence regulators, mounting a well-financed campaign to the effect of the Four Horsemen of the Infopocalypse. Bitcoin acceptance is condemned, BTC venues withdrawn, price crashes and somebody winds up for some reason with a bunch of unsellable BTC in a rapidly declining market. In this scenario, a heads-up from Washington via corporate contacts would help alleviate the problem somewhat, so some of the risk could be discounted.

Additional protocol layers allow for additional capabilities. For example, by "coloring" a set of coins by distinguishing it from the rest, it is possible to add additional value to the underlying Bitcoin independent of the face value. In short, you can theoretically trade anything with it, from Smart Property to stock options.
The latter is especially interesting to anyone who's ever had the shirt ripped off their back entering or exiting a trade. If I can transfer you a share of stock for a negligible fee in a thoroughly liquid market, why would anyone pay such high fees? The Ripple exchange, still in beta, allows FOREX trading for little to no cost.
However, alt-Coins present their own dilemmas. Despite the fact that some of these coins have a marketable utility (Namecoin and Peercoin spring to mind), most possess little or no utility apart from being competitor blockchains to Bitcoin, and yet are entirely dependent upon the Bitcoin ecosystem for their value.
The Bitcoin community is currently divided on whether such tagalong coins represent diversification opportunities or not. They do not. Diversification implies that the underlying assets are negatively correlated; spurious alt-coins amplify market booms and busts by introducing unnecessary speculation into the market and confuse potential early adopters. While network externalities may ultimately guarantee the victory of the Bitcoin network over such pretenders, but the resulting loss of time and the misallocation of capital will conspire to make it a more painful affair than it strictly has to be.
Bitcoin's stratospheric rise presents a potentially existential crisis-in-the-making for Western Union. Established incumbents rarely respond with agility to disruptive innovation. Many of my fellow Contributors on Seeking Alpha see Western Union as a deep value play, preferring to emphasize the ubiquitous nature of its services at the expense of the potential impact of technological disruption.
While this view may make sense from a balance-sheet point-of-view, but from a long-term perspective, it's precisely wrong. Cryptocurrency is now a multi-billion dollar working proof-of-concept. What was once a stroke of genius has devolved into a textbook engineering problem. One cannot simply "un-exist" such knowledge.

Shareholders who are regular people who just own eBay stock AND eBay as a company, though I don't think for a minute that eBay will surrender it's hard won PayPal monopoly. On the other hand, it may wish to augment it by accepting BTC if the moat separating PayPal's infrastructure-in-place from BTC-driven alternatives was wide enough. With the size of the current market at (checks Zero Block) 6.11 billion [BTE-E exchange value], the case for accepting BTC via PayPal may be substantial.

I've been studying Bitcoin (while recovering from a rather bad hangover) more or less constantly for the past 24 hours and I must say that I agree with many of your points, though I still hold to my original analysis. It's true that a deflationary currency can survive very well, if not optimally, so long as either a) a real economy exists to underpin the economy and/or b) the deflationary currency is readily translatable to inflationary currencies that underpin a real economy. 
As of now, Bitcoin operates via method (b) than method (a), though there are ways around that, too. (For example, if products were offered at a DISCOUNT-to-DOLLAR [D2D, or more precisely, a Discount to RETAIL Dollar/D2RD or Discount to WHOLESALE Dollar D2WD], then it would just be good ol' fashioned economic sense to transact in BTC vs. USD.  
Re: Deflationary currencies: While the Gold Standard created numerous panics and had equally numerous flaws while it was still in place, it didn't stop the U.S. from becoming the economic engine of the world. The invention of a better cryptocurrency (one that inflates in some manner corresponding to the number of real goods exchanged, for example) need to "pop" bitcoin, if a mechanism is in place that smoothly translates the old currency for the new. As this would require the introduction of a monetary authority, however, such a "New Bitcoin" would require mass adoption or some sort of inherent New BTC ---&gt; Old BTC conversion mechanism. (Just thinking out loud here, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.) [I'm not much of an Austrian, though you don't really have to be to be of a Libertarian inclination.] 
Now, a question: At this point, it seems that small sellers that are willing to tolerate range-bound price swings (this describes one of my budding family businesses, being rare books and certified autographs) will be the ones to benefit from the network effects of dealing in bitcoin. Furthermore, it seems to me that the inherent volatility of BTC would actually tend to *increase* merchant sales by shaking out the weak hands, especially if the banks make it problematic to transfer large quantities of bitcoin-made cash. 
Would the Bitcoiners here agree with that assessment?

So does separating your concepts. 
Are we arguing about Bitcoin's value as a transfer protocol, a virtual commodity, a de facto currency, private money, or the feasibility of a deflationary system in general? Because if it's the latter, I would argue that while deflationary currencies may not be *optimal*, they are nevertheless *viable*, at least inasmuch as less deflationary instruments are written against them. 
For instance, you hear a lot about how "gold has been used as money for thousands of years", but it's not really so except for high population density civilizations, and even then, the metal that the majority used was usually silver. (Gold allowed for moving large sums more efficiently and preserved inter-generational wealth more effectively, provided that you had access to it in the first place, which not many people did.)

My definition of money is that it's a non-degradable, sub-divisible and hopefully non-forgable social IOU and relatively stable store of value roughly corresponding to time and effort that can be cashed in with other members of the society in question that participation makes "real" (reality by consensus). 
This doesn't embody all of its characteristics IMHO, just the most important ones. (Gold enthusiasts would disagree with it, of course.)

Text: Economics majors say that they're not interested in Bitcoin yet. That's a pity. The battle currently playing out on r/Bitcoin and its affiliated subreddits is the stuff of legend. Say what you like about the gall of programmers teaching themselves economics in a kind of pay-as-you-go fashion or the pitfalls of a gold standard: At the end of the day, economists still pay for their lattes by writing about currency unions rather than building them.
More importantly, the obsessive media focus over the intrinsic value of the currency is overshadowing an uncomfortable truth, namely, that the much vaunted moats of major money transmission services are no more immune to technological disruption than any other service-oriented market.
Exhibit A is a recent research paper from the Berenberg Bank, which has the distinction to be both Germany's oldest bank and the second oldest bank in the world after Monte dei Paschi di Siena.
"The consensus view backs the incumbents and the incumbents typically give two lines of defense against these disruptive alternative solution providers: trust and scale. Bitcoin's success suggests that maybe both of these are overrated."
Wait, it gets better -
"Greater adoption of virtual currencies like bitcoin can bring about transformative improvement for remittances flows and have a significant social impact. Not only can it improve the frictions in the market and uplift the flows by around 10% due to the removal of fees, it can also help lift inter-regional flows by making it more convenient. Using the statistics above, the direct impact is an increase of $51.4bn."
Berenberg's abrupt volte-face may strike some as a bizarre turn of events, to say the least, but it's really very much in character. Banks issue stock, too. A share of common stock tends to be a strong claim on the future profitability of a company and a relatively weak claim on the company's assets, and incentive structures tend to be aligned accordingly. In other words, there's not nearly as much money to be made in defending an well established and saturated market as is there is in creating and nurturing new ones. For this reason, banks have shown little appetite for defending the status quo when insurgency pays better.
How Disruptive Technology Shifts The Demand Curve
Innovative technologies that reduce the per unit or per transaction costs within well-established industries are by their very nature disruptive due to their impact on the demand curve. Initially, these technologies fail to satisfy either low or high end demand and are ignored by the market until they become more profitable. However, note the incline of the curve.
[Chart] 
(Source: Clayton M. Christensen, Innovator's Dilemma)
As these technologies mature, they eventually surpass sustaining technologies due to lower costs. The result is excess demand, as consumers will tend to use the same service much more frequently at a lower cost than at a higher cost.
For example, consider candy. In 1914, candy of any kind was a luxury. Sweets became much more common from the 1920s-30s, largely from cheaper production costs. Low-cost availability radically shifted the demand curve and altered consumption patterns. Today, the average American eats 3.4 pounds of candy on Halloween alone. In a similar way, Western Union (WU) wire transfers tend to be reserved for either sending money back home (remittance), special occasions, or emergencies, and the size of the transfer is often in proportion to the fee incurred. (See the fee schedule below.)
