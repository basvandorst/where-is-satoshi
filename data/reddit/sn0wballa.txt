i think itll hit 22k either way before the yr ends
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:24:49
because they profited heavily already 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:19:52
was thinking something similar. can't the "whales" of the industry fuck with the market?

I've asked previously but the answer was no 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:59:48
I think once you convert it to cash and withdraw from an exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:43:14
how'd it go? coinbase says transaction complete but funds not in gemini yet...been over an hour
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:25:15
lol won't it just get worse from here? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:40:58
LIMIT will be just that one condition, sell at 20k. Loss order will be the lowest you'll let it fall to recoup your loss more for day trading. LIMIT order is what you'd want to do

He will eat his dick if he's wrong? wtf lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:17:30
prob buying hoping it hits the 20k mark 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:23:11
perfect for day trading - the spread on btc in 24hr span is ridiculous
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:09:39
^exactly. not sure what the actual benefit is to the average joe. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:22:58
i'm curious as to how the price will be more stable for this to be widely adopted. i know BTC ogs say price doesn't/shouldn't matter and what not, but how can it not? i'm entering with fiat - yes it's shit but it's what pays the bills and gets us by in life today. 
how can the average joe just start entering the btc market when it's so volatile and honestly, highly manipulated?

congrats - better than 0! fund it whenever you can and sit for the long hauk
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:36:55
this is a cool idea!
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:51:30
aka launder? lol 
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:24:56
just buying it outright is better?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:11:17
im seeing $7,131.50 – $7,990.00 on gemini :(

BTC? or just ICO? and how would you withdraw if btc is banned in the usa? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:15:28
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:03:29
Ok so lets say BTC itself isnt banned but exchanges such as gemini, based in usa companies, are. How do you withdraw without it being considered as laundering? Wouldnt this tank the price of btc as well?

already dropped lower than mining costs
