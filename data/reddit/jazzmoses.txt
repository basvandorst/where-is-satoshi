What's the scam? That gradually the whole world might settle on a single free currency because the alternative is statist junk run by corrupt regimes, where you are only ever one political crisis away from the next round of debasement? That those who commit earlier face more risk but will profit proportionally more if Bitcoin succeeds? Everyone's an adult, it's a realistic investment prospect and individuals are perfectly capable of evaluating it and deciding on whether they want to take the gamble.
If you think it's a scam, then you probably thought the guy recommending you buy Apple shares in the late 90s was a scammer as well huh.

If you think the government's licensing system is so great, why not the make it voluntary? That way, if it really is so efficient and effective, firms who believe that it will be a business advantage to sign up will do so of their own free will, and consumers can make their own decisions about whether it is worth it to pay the extra such firms must charge.
That way the system also allows other voluntary certification initiatives to compete to provide the best and most efficient balancing of interests between consumers and providers of financial services. However if the government initiative is compulsory, then all firms must either a) pay the fees or b) risk even higher costs through non-compliance, lowering the incentive for anyone to try and compete in certification because all businesses are in one way or another forced to pay for the government's programme.

@_date: 2015-06-03 23:37:10
Your comparisons are utterly fallacious.
Stabbing people is an anti-consensual behaviour, so everyone benefits from preventing it, the only question is whether there are better ways of preventing it than relying on and empowering a pseudo-democratic centralised conglomerate of men with guns.
Counterfeiting money is infringing on the government's violent monopoly on money control, so it's only a "crime" insofar as the government wishes and has the power to protect its monopoly. As a "crime" it has no relevance in a world of freely competing, inherently-secure distributed currencies.
Free choice of firms providing financial services however is a pure matter of consensus. If I, party A, wish to entrust my money to a firm, party B, then you, party C, have no business at all telling me I can't, even if you 100% believe that I am making a bad business decision. By all means feel free to try and tell me that I am making a bad decision, but I'll make my own mind up, thank you. Anyway, what do you care about what I do with my money, why don't you worry about your own money instead?
The only possible arguments you could make as to why the government should be allowed to mandate and enforce a minimum level of conduct among said firms is if you believe that a) people are on the whole so stupid that they are inherently, inevitably unable to make sound economic decisions (to which a) I feel sorry for your lack of faith in others and b) you should also believe that men with guns should regulate all our economic decisions, or else you must rely on convoluted logic to defend all the inconsistencies about what you believe they should and shouldn't control) or b) you think that somehow men with guns is a more efficient form of market regulation than any voluntary organic alternative. 
In which case you should probably realise that history is rife with 100% voluntary initiatives to set product standards in industries, totally free of government intervention. Minority food groups is a great example, eg vegan, kosher and halal certification. Other examples include electrical/fire safety initiatives, as well as environmentalist programs (eg FSC). 
So there will certainly be voluntary certification programs in a non-goverment regulated Bitcoin world, however they will be a) products of free competition (so multiple groups can attempt certification initiatives, and over time consumers will work out which ones are most effective, and the initiatives can compete to provide the most efficient balance of priorities between businesses (who desire low costs, easy compliance) and consumers (who value trustworthiness and also low cost (passed on through the cost of the service))). Just like all other spheres of society, free competition will produce results a) cheaper b) higher quality and c) richer and more lively than the result of a monopolistic men-with-guns approach.

Setting aside the specifics of the timeline here in SL's decisions and actions...
Why? Fundamentally when the source code is open the licensing, unless the publisher is willing to try to invoke state-based coercion, is really just a formal request, as a mark of consideration, that their wishes for how the code be used be respected. Do you not think that's appropriate? Setting aside questions of practicality in today's environment, do you think it's reasonable for people even merely to request that their wishes be heeded? Would you yourself be happy to abdicate all prerogatives to request respect of any IP you develop?
I understand that you might think (irrespective of whether I agree with you or not) that a certain sphere would function best if all code/material were fully open-license, but I don't understand why it would be so emotionally objectionable to you that someone would even simply request that their wishes to the contrary be respected...

To me it makes no fucking sense to try and distinguish Bitcoin the currency vs blockchain technology. Why? To maintain a decentralised public ledger you need a way of incentivising people to do computational work to secure it. The only way to do that is if they receive something they consider valuable. So there has to be a valuable token. Fiat currencies won't work because there's no way to migrate them to a scarce digital ecosystem without either a) building a fallible centralised money issuer or b) cloning Bitcoin. So fundamentally for any of these whiz-bang Blockchain 2.0 things to work you need the fundamental token to be valued. I.e. you need Bitcoin to be something everyone is competing to have the highest number as possible of.
And once you've accepted that Bitcoin the token has to retain value, does it really make any difference whether your 2.0 tech is running by storing itself in TX metadata, or encoding itself directly into TX values, or just built with a system that hooks in BTC micropayments? No, no, and no. It doesn't matter. Whatever your dumb 2.0 idea is, Bitcoin and the blockchain will be it's foundation, and they will only exist because people desire Bitcoin in and of itself.
I think people rationalise Bitcoin like this because they are uncomfortable with its image as a world currency competitor and its potential to challenge governments. Not that I necessarily think you need to believe nation-states will be completely unable to adapt to the Bitcoin challenge but fuck, trying to fob off the whole issue by saying "currency is only the first app" is just stupid.

Look into the geopolitical history of the areas that these terrorists come from. You'll realise that Western powers have been meddling for *decades* - centuries even - whether just outright colonialism and military control at first, or later supporting coups, subverting democracy, enlisting corrupt elites - all to literally steal the natural resources of these countries. It's a simple equation: make a few corrupt bastards with control of the local military fabulously wealthy so they'll help you fuck over anyone who tries to stop you taking all of a country's oil. If anyone raises a stink, pay to get them killed or suppressed.
The amount of blood on Western hands is unbelievable. It's monstrous. These people have a right to hate us. You would hate us if you were them and understood why everything in your country was completely fucked, because someone has been deliberately fucking you and your people over for the last two hundred or so years.

Well I'm a Trezor owner, I consider myself a part of the community, and I don't hate them. I'm still satisfied with the source code being publicly viewable, and I respect their wish to protect the integrity of their business. Also like said, no one outside of SL actually contributed anything to the repo.
I think perhaps they could have planned a little more intelligently from the outset the license they published with but it doesn't matter to me, what matters to me is that it's a good product and they are incentivised to keep developing and supporting it without getting ripped off. Not saying that BWallet did anything wrong yet but I understand SL's actions, I would be scared too if I were them, not surprising they act hastily.

To take your question at face value, it would seem like a tricky game to guess which companies benefit the most from cronyism, and to work out if shareholders can get in on the action in any meaningful way. Most of these cronyists seem perfectly happy to take their million/billion dollar salaries+bonuses, run the companies into the ground, cash in on government aid, and then move on to the next sinecure, government chairmanship, or other joke at the taxpayer's expense. I'm not sure what benefits the average shareholder can expect to reap here, certainly it would be a fraction of that of a trader who is buying and selling in alignment with these games, and their profits would be again a mere fraction of those of the cronyists themselves.
Certainly your essential point is correct that some people can and do profit individually from government's economic intervention. The benefits of government intervention for those individuals will however always be outweighed by the economic destruction wrought on wider society, the net effect of government is always negative. So long-term any individual should support less government, because long-term no individual can guarantee remaining in the favoured circles of government intervention, and thus long-term all individuals will be negatively impacted by government.

I do agree that Bitcoin is fundamentally Tulip-esque. I don't consider this a shocking or defamatory statement either.
Either enough people will decide that they want to have the highest Bitcoin balance as possible or they won't. There is no way to programmatically ensure that people will care about the ledger values the system maintains.
My fear is that no matter how much the geeks and enthusiasts want Bitcoin to succeed, the wider populace may just respond with a shrug. They don't understand how much they're robbed and screwed over by depending on fiat. Sticking with fiat is just business as usual, jumping to Bitcoin is crazy and unpredictable. People are sheep and mostly want to stay with what is safe and trusted and not think too much about it... so how is a massive Bitcoin transition supposed to work exactly?

He believed in Bitcoin and risked everything he had. Sorry but that's worth respecting, people like him could envision a radically different future, and risked everything and boosted the price in the early days. People like him helped give other people the confidence to also take the plunge and keep driving the movement forward.


Well that's a completely new argument, OP was attacking him for going to prison as if Bitcoiners should think poorly of someone for being convicted by the *government*. I can't believe that I have to explain this, this should be basic on r/bitcoin!


People who argued for blocksize increases were censored on r/bitcoin. There's nothing baseless about it. On a technical and implementation issue, mods censored people they disagreed with instead of allowing discussion.

Price is a measure of the desire people have for bitcoin and the value of presents to them. As the price goes up, and desire and value with it, the advantages offered by bitcoin can be realised to ever greater degrees, and the benefit to the world and all people become ever more pronounced. 
It is silly to say "I am happy with where bitcoin is today, I can buy enough stuff in a few places in the Internet, the experiment was successful". Everyone should be aiming for a 100% bitcoin world, the benefits that stem from the strong network effects of a technologically advanced money are magnitudes above what bitcoin offers today. 
That sort of success is inextricably tied to a price increase, the price functions as a measurement index.

Because none of that is really important. Bitcoin is open source, so it can be duplicated at zero cost. If the critical reason for its success were its technology, it wouldn't have any competitive advantage, because you could create unlimited clones with the same technology.

You should distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions. Technological competence is necessary, but it is not sufficient for a coin to succeed. The network effect is also not sufficient, but it is still more important because it cannot be replicated, whereas technology can as long as bitcoin remains a network of computers running open-source software.

But to function governments still need to be able to buy goods and services with the currency they acquire through taxation. Government agents and contractors are just as susceptible to the same basic logic which make Bitcoin more attractive than any fiat currency (principally guaranteed scarcity and global financial freedom) and thus should be expected in the long term to desire Bitcoin over their own national fiat. Governments might try and pretend that their fiat is still as valuable as they decide it is, because they don't want to admit that they've lost the power of printing money (how's that going, Argentina?) - but the game is up when those same government employees are greedy for Bitcoin, not the fiat. 
It'd be similar to if Greece went back to the drachma. Who in their right mind in Greece would prefer the drachma, a currency threatened from the outset by an unstable govt. with strong incentives to hyperinflate the currency, over the euro, a currency whose inflation is controlled by a much tighter political process? It doesn't matter what Greece tries to claim the drachma should be worth, everyone, including govt. employees, will prefer euros.

True pyramid schemes are unsustainable because they promise the same rewards to all new members. Bitcoin isn't a true pyramid scheme because the potential monetary reward to new adopters will reduce down to 0 when the last people convert, and no one with half a brain would claim otherwise. However the safety of investment, utility of Bitcoin and its ease of use also increase proportionally as more adopt it. 
So it's actually very fair. Early adopters gain the most but take the biggest risk and suffer the lowest short-term utility. Most importantly no one is forced to adopt it (except sort of at the latter stages when large amounts of people refuse to accept fiat currency, but conversely we wouldn't want to infringe their right to prefer a given media of exchange).

This is all well and good and congratulations on all the good work, but the only reason altcoins can be innovative and have "killer features" that leave bitcoin in the dust is because they're unpopular and no one cares about them. So anyone can implement anything they want with them because there's little to no real consensus requirements. If any altcoin was to usurp bitcoin in popularity, it would run into exactly the same political problems, so you might as well get used to it and learn how to work with these issues.

Firstly, I wasn't talking about my ambition, but about the people who frequent r/Bitcoin.
Secondly, being ambitious to make a lot of money is still ambition, despite your prejudices.
Thirdly, a lot of people into Bitcoin have many ambitions, and some don't even care about making money. Such as reducing government control, improving the efficiency of payments, promoting a world economy, helping people who suffer from the impacts of poor financial technologies. 
Also there is no reason why one can't hope to make money and still be excited about any of other possible benefits of Bitcoin. They're not mutually exclusive nor are they even necessarily sources of bias in one's assessment of the benefits Bitcoin could pose to the global community.
Fourthly, those who buy Bitcoin both a) sacrifice their consumption of other goods they might desire in the short-term and b) take the risk that they will lose everything they put in. In return the market price of Bitcoin is maintained, network security is funded, and the chance is higher that Bitcoin will actually succeed as the world currency. I wouldn't call that doing nothing. Or are you morally opposed to investment?

@_date: 2019-01-03 11:00:47
You do you, but the fact is that from every 1 pre-2017 Bitcoin in existence, there are currently four separate forked descendant coins with nontrivial valuations, and every pre-2017 Bitcoin holder either holds up to all four, or has sold some to other hodlers, and the resulting nontrivial valuations are indications of the same hodler's "refusal to sell at any price" for each forkcoin.
So you may think they are "shitcoins", nevertheless the only accurate way to compare valuations pre and post 2017 is by grouping forkcoins into a combined valuation, because this is about facts, not feelings.
Not sure why anyone should be offended by this, actually it shows that bitcoin is even more successful than a analysis ignoring non-BTC descendants would indicate.
@_date: 2019-01-03 10:45:05
Shouldn't forget that the true comparison with pre-2017 bitcoin price is now the sum price of BTC, BCH, BSV and BTG (all the bitcoin descendants with nontrivial values).
E.g. the current price for BTC is ~3900, combined price of descendants ~4200

@_date: 2019-01-03 11:19:13
Ahh I think I understand. So malicious nodes could collate info about users, and the risks of repeatedly using malicious nodes increase as the network gets smaller.
But how can this be translated into an attack? The malicious node operator may just be able to link your addresses together, but still should not know who is behind the addresses.
And is this a concern as well if someone just wants to sell all of their forkcoin holdings ASAP? Most likely they would be sending their entire balance to a fiat or crypto-only exchange anyway.

And those tax rates increase to 60-70% within a mere 4-5 multiples of average income! 
The only people really active in European politics anymore are those old and rich enough to have fought themselves some breathing room from the madness (parties for pensioners demanding higher taxes for the young and more free shit for the old are big atm).

* If Bitcoin is so Orwellian, why haven't any Bitcoin thieves been caught? Why are people using it left right and centre to buy government-prohibited good on darknet markets?
* Bitcoin can't be hacked, Bitcoin wallets can be, just like gold vaults can be hacked. It's the inevitable consequence of Bitcoin's extreme technological advantages over gold, and it just boils down to a management problem, just like all modern software security issues.
* Bitcoin's encryption algorithms are open-source and peer-reviewed. If there were any vulnerabilities discovered in them they would be replaced.
* Bitcoin has major network advantages that make it extremely unlikely that any altcoin competitor will ever be even a fraction of its value.
In the end, no matter what you say, gold cannot be sent economically in arbitrarily sized and accurate amounts almost instantaneously to anywhere in the world with 99.999999% confirmation within an hour, which is means it will never be used as a currency ever again, except perhaps in the event of a total breakdown of society (but just because it might not work in that scenario doesn't mean it's a bad technology. Electric cars are an excellent technology and they wouldn't work in an apocalypse.)

Compare that to Bitcoin where I can have 1-conf within 10 minutes for a fraction of a cent. Every ten minutes I get a new confirmation and the Bitcoin is more irrevocably mine.
And how safe it is to send the gold? I can send a dollar or ten million dollars of Bitcoin and it's just as easy, cheap, fast and secure. And as long as you can get online to send me your public key, you can receive it anywhere, even the ISS. And I can send it to you no matter who you or I am, no matter our politics or whether our governments like us.

Right, I agree with you that embedded Bitcoin wallets are important. But such chips can function just as well as the foundation for the IoT if they don't mine Bitcoin and you just send them Bitcoin to work with from your central wallet. So why would anyone want to buy an uneconomical 21 Inc IoT chip if they can get one that doesn't try and compete with centralised miners? Because unless somehow tiny dispersed chips in everything manage to be more efficient than centralised mining rigs, these chips are just going to cost people money.
21 Inc is specifically marketing its chips on their ability to mine. If they don't mine economically, they won't be desirable (unless people are too stupid to do the maths.) If they're not desirable, people won't be putting 21 Inc chips in their devices, they'll be using other Bitcoin wallet solutions.

I wasn't arguing that was a given, hence why I said "if".
As for Bitcoin vs Netflix, the smart/risky thing to do would have been to bet big on Netflix in 1997 or so when it was just gearing up, before the period where it expanded at the cost of old legacy businesses, before it was even widely understood that a company like Netflix had the potential to expand in this way and that Netflix had the potential to be that company. Now the business landscape is changing/changed and Netflix-style businesses have become the new normal, driving profit margins down, so now I wouldn't recommend investing solely in Netflix. It is a different business phase.
Bitcoin however is a whole different ballgame, right now very much analogous to Netflix circa 1997. Bitcoin is a new entrant into a extremely, almost uniquely stagnant market, and it has massive, Netflix-eclipsing expansion potential. Bitcoin has the potential to grow at the expense of all government-produced currencies including the Dollar, Pound, Euro, Yen, Yuan, as well as gold, silver, and to a lesser extent, property, stocks, and government bonds, among many other assets which people use as savings tools in this age of inflationary fiat currencies.
Similarly, it is not currently widely understood that this potential for expansion is there and that Bitcoin could be the commodity to achieve this expansion. So the potential for extremely large gains exist if you are one of the people who puts the effort in to develop their opinion and make a risky call at a time when Bitcoin is on very few people's radars worldwide.
Crucially, unlike Netflix however, Bitcoin only becomes more attractive to own as more people own it. The endgame of Bitcoin is monopoly or very close to monopoly.

I only imagine a system where nodes request data and offer to pay a small fee for it. There's no inherent limit on the number of nodes in the chain, so there can be a whole series of proxy nodes paying each other.
The limiting factor would be price competition, i.e. everytime a proxy node gets in the middle it has to add a little margin to make profit, so because data-requesters would always be looking for the cheapest provider, that would keep the system efficient.

But you also have to pay to retrieve data from the blockchain, whether you want to run a full node, in which case you may need to incentivise others to send you blocks, or you are doing SPV, in which case you may need to pay to get a full node to send you the validating tx history. So that might outweigh some of the tragedy of the commons in that the your transaction data continues to be potentially useful to others in the future, because it becomes the basis of transactions they want to push to the network.
It is tricky though, you're right. Hopefully with enough focus on efficiency it will become manageable, it would be a shame if Bitcoin failed because it was possible to correctly incentivise the system as it becomes more popular.

Okay I'm imagining that. I'm also imagining that this chip is not competitive with large-scale dedicated miners, and therefore costs more in electricity than it produces in Bitcoin. If 21 Inc's chips really are groundbreakingly efficient, they will be yet more efficient aggregated into large mining centres.


End-users don't care about any of those goals, they care about whether something makes money or not. If it just throws away money they're not going to want it.


Just like all other industries, Bitcoin mining favours economies of scale. Just like it is more economically efficient for a few large corporations to compete in the provision of any other good, it is more efficient for a few large miners to compete in the provision of hashing. Decentralisation is a wild goose chase. Don't let your ideals cloud your rationality.


If that's really you're argument for these chips, that people are willing to throw away money to avoid the psychological pain of having to buy and transmit Bitcoin to their various connected devices, fine. I am sure there are a lot of real and potential companies out there waiting to help people with that process in a way that doesn't involve throwing money out through noncompetitive smallscale mining.

@_date: 2015-03-12 12:53:16
Thanks for the feedback! It's a great opportunity to hone these ideas.
I think the relationship between long-term saving and short-term transacting is symbiotic. Everyone will do both with Bitcoin, just like everyone does both with fiat currently. I think a healthy chain has people doing both, and without both any chain will fail.
I think you're exactly right in noting that (as I think I alluded) an inflation-funded Bitcoin would be vulnerable to market failure when sidechains come on board. If there were two chains available, one with high inflation + low tx fees, the other no inflation + high tx fees, people would hold their savings in the latter and move balances into the former for their transactions, leaving the inflationary chain underfunded and leading to market failure.
Anyway, one of the major points that I'm heading towards is that we need to be able to experiment with these ideas using sidechains. Otherwise it's just educated guessing and there's no way of predicting or determining 100% what is possible, how things could be implemented, how popular they will be, how they will actually work out.
@_date: 2015-03-10 07:14:05


Yes but price should roughly scale with transaction volume. Yes transaction volume can intensify independently as Bitcoin technology matures but, ceteris parabis, the more people that desire and want to use Bitcoin, the more transactions there will be + the more valuable bitcoin becomes. So the rigidity of the block reward is an obstacle to lowering cost per transaction (at least until the fixed block is halved enough times and we can start experimenting with more organic ways to determine and fund the optimal level of network security.)


As you intimated, the majority of mining expense is hashing, in comparison the costs of validating and storing TXs are trivial. Furthermore over time voluntary TX fees will [trend to just paying for the cost of their inclusion]( (in this regard we can probably expect to see competition to lower these costs, as minimal as they will be.) 
So I think overall the prime consideration in making Bitcoin cost-effective is the minimum amount we need to pay for a secure global ledger. And right now are hands are basically tied because Satoshi has already given us a floor on a possible answer (10% of the value of the network per year currently.)
@_date: 2016-05-19 18:30:20
7) What income, Mr. Tax Collector?
@_date: 2015-03-01 15:05:06


My argument was designed to logically demonstrate how, in the absence of a fixed block reward, the basic design of the network will cause voluntary transaction fees to trend to just covering the cost of block-inclusion. It's a logic-based argument, so equations and numbers would just be illustrative; I'm doing this in my spare time so I didn't feel it was worth adding them on for this article. Feel free to read the whole article and, if you have any numbers or equations which would be a problem for my argument, I'm all ears.


Yes, which I mentioned. It doesn't matter how low the cost of inclusion is, the ultimate equilibrium voluntary transaction fee should be equally negligible. There may be a lower bound because miners become apathetic about including transactions when the TX fee is so low, but that in itself supports my argument - the lower bound holds no premium for hashing, it is only enough to convince a miner to include the TX.


Bitcoin without any hashing would be useless. Everyone that I know of agrees on that. So if we agree that some hashing is needed, the question is therefore *how much* and *how do we get it?* Right now we don't have to worry about that because Satoshi gave us some magic numbers (the current fixed block reward x the current price of Bitcoin gives us a monetary incentive which drives a certain level of investment in mining, which produces hashing.) In future we will need an answer. How soon depends on when Satoshi's scheduled block reward first drops below the level of hashing the community considers adequate.  


I think you have things a little backwards here. The absolute level of hashing doesn't matter. Like in all fields, competitive pressure will drive increased efficiency in hashing, so over time at a constant block reward we'd expect hashing difficulty to increase. The thing that really matters is the financial investment required to deploy a majority attack against the network, and measuring hashing power is just a proxy for measuring how expensive such an attack is. How much money does it cost to buy enough rigs to have a majority? The higher the block reward = more money offered to incentivise mining = more money invested in mining = more expensive such an attack is.

Are you talking about the need for a market for payments for relaying blocks and transactions? That's an interesting issue and one I'm interested in as well, but I'm actually focussing this series specifically on the question of incentivising *hashing power.* I think network propagation is an issue where the market may spontaneously form solutions, paying for hashing power however requires most likely as far as I can tell majority support for new consensus rules. That's something where community discussion does matter quite a lot.

@_date: 2015-03-10 06:26:42
Nice article However I'm not sure if I agree with your argument that hashing costs will not increase as transactions scale. As more people adopt Bitcoin the price for Bitcoin must rise, there is no way around it, demand will increase. Because mining is incentivised by the block reward, and the block reward is fixed, the amount the network will pay for security will increase. 
Furthermore, increases in the efficiency of mining equipment will make no difference at all, ultimately miners will buy mining equipment up to the level justified by from a business perspective by the block reward. More efficient hashing will just mean the difficulty will increase but overall financial expense on hashing will match the block reward.

@_date: 2015-10-12 12:35:46
Bitcoin doesn't generate revenue itself. Buying Bitcoin is speculation that demand for Bitcoin may increase significantly in the future, and thus Bitcoin may currently be underpriced. I'll try sum it up.
Economies need monetary commodities. Currently monies in use are divided into national territories. They depend upon inefficient centralised monopolists to control money creation, verification and to a large extent, transmission networks. Due to the inhibition of competition by the monopolists, technological progress in these monies is slow to nonexistent, inhibiting global trade and making life harder in an increasingly mobile, global world. Furthermore all of these currencies are vulnerable to corrupt, short-sighted and fickle political decision-making, so anyone who holds them is at risk of having their wealth diluted at any time my money-printing.
Bitcoin is a free-market open-source currency/currency network that can be used by anyone in the world that offers major technological advantages over fiat currencies. It is also much more resistant to unpredictable inflation and thus a much better inherent store of value. Because anyone who holds Bitcoin has an incentive for it to become more valuable, its popularity can propagate virally where holders promote it among their social circles or find ways to promote it through e.g. business ventures. And as more people use it, it becomes more attractive and more useful, thus making more people likely to consider it. Thus while Bitcoin is a relatively minor feature of the current global economy, it benefits from multiple positive-feedback loops which can lead it to grow very quickly.
If Bitcoin grows in this way then it has the potential to completely supplant all fiat currencies, the result would be a massive increase in its value, the possibilities should interest any savvy investor.

@_date: 2015-10-09 11:00:24
In the short term, you can already get Bitcoin P2P with Mycelium. Sure it's more expensive, but that's the price you pay for enhanced anonymity.
The most important thing is to progressively transfer wealth from fiat currencies to Bitcoin/distributed currencies. That attacks governments firstly through weakenining the impact of their money-creation. Secondly, even Bitcoin that has been obtained through a regulated fiat-BTC node can be progressively anonymised and removed from the control of your government. Much easier to transfer Bitcoin to private wallets, or to an exchange/hosted wallet operating in a low-regulation area of the world. Add in uses of anonymising services and the natural anonymisation as people begin to perform transactions and the money gets mixed around.
I guess the real question is how governments will react if/when Bitcoin starts to take over. Will they demand that anyone who made profit on its value increase pay taxes whenever they "cash out" even if by buying a normal good? Will they request that all Bitcoin transactions be reported? If so, would people comply?

I think if Bitcoin were to succeed to this level, governments everywhere would be struggling and anarchistic political organisation will be growing in power. I don't think governments would be breaking down entirely just yet, I think we can expect that on more of a 50-100 year timescale. But there ability to act recklessly and accumulate debt would be coming under enormous pressure. I would expect their fiat currencies to not be valueless just yet, but they would have sustained serious devaluations and I think they would be fast approaching life-support. Governments could start getting desperate which would accelerate the pace of change.
But more and more, the restrictions, inconvencies and inefficiencies imposed by our current regime of a world split up into centralised state authorities will a) be recognised as pernicious by the average person and b) be challenged and put under stress. The global network of modern, voluntary businesses and social constructs will be strengthening, and Bitcoin will be the glue that increasingly allows this network to smoothly interact, a way to achieve freedom from governments by decoupling from the traditional system of monitored and regulated finance, and a real way for people to vote against government power and for freedom, by shifting their cash savings from fiat to Bitcoin.

The answer is probably that there needs to be a marketplace for buying and selling network services (relaying of blocks and transactions). There's no reason why you personally can't get involved thinking about this issue, coming up with proposals, presenting them to the community, and taking feedback, with the aim of either a) going all the way to the core devs if need be to get changes made in the protocol or b) building some code of your own as a proof of concept.

In a network with no block reward and no constraint on TX fees, where equlibrium TX fees only pay for the costs of block inclusion, there would still be miners competing for these fees, and the more efficient miners would profit the most. But there would be no premium paid for extra hashing, so the difficulty level should be at the lower bound. Miners are competing only for efficiency in block inclusion, not hashing, because there is no profit in hashing.
You are right that the least efficient miners would quit hashing first, but that is always true of the network.

I see sidechains as offering a chance for free-market competition for network architecture, piggybacking on the value of bitcoin itself.  If mining on a sidechain could be done more efficiently than on Bitcoin main, sidechains could compete and attract transactions. Thus innovation can happen in sidechains and then be merged into main if desired, providing the competitive impetus to improve Bitcoin main even if bitcoin itself is the only valued digital token in circulation.
Seems like a big win if it works.

Bitcoin has only two possible outcomes in my opinion: total success or total failure. 
Because the potential gains (per another commenter, &gt;$100,000 per coin, IMO more likely &gt;$1 million) are so enormous, they far outstrip the potential losses. Basically it's like a roulette where you either lose every dollar you put in if it lands on black, or get 100-1000x back if it lands on red. The only questions are:
* What do you judge the ratio of red to black squares to be?
* How much poverty would you be willing to risk if it fails?
* How much are you prepared to sacrifice your current desires for consumption to set aside capital for buying bitcoin? 
The correct answer for how much you should invest is arrived at by combining these three answers. Some people have decided that they are 100% confident that bitcoin will succeed, or they are almost totally confident but willing to risk total bankruptcy, and so they actually go into fiat-denominated debt to buy bitcoin, and severely constrain their consumption, taking a leveraged position. This is extreme, but their gains if bitcoin succeeds will be equally extreme. They will go from being crazies on blogs to part of a new financial über-elite.
This might seem like a hard choice to make, but remember, it's hard for everyone. Everyone in this situation would be tempted into going all-in, whether you have $1000, $50,000, or $50 million. Everyone has the same chance to catapult their life into an utterly alien level of material wealth. The $50-millionaire's eyes are glazed over dreaming of a life with $50-500 billion in wealth. 
Personally, my hope is that it will not take too long for more certainty of bitcoin's future. With every low there is the danger that hope fades and the price keeps sagging. It would be hard to recover from too low a dip. But every time the price rebounds, bitcoin grows stronger, more potent. Right now it is a cub, seen as cute and insignificant. But if it survives, soon it must grows fangs and claws, and its appetites will rise. It will not stay cute for long.
Because I have not been accumulating savings for much time, and because no other investment offers possibilities even remotely as fantastical as bitcoin to elevate my standard of living, I am willing to invest very aggressively, while leaving a fairly small buffer to hedge against failure. If the price rises I intend to proportionally decrease my fiat holdings. The aim would be to have an almost zero fiat stake on the cusp of hyperbitcoinisation. 
If bitcoin would fail I believe/hope it would not hurt me too much, just force me to repeat currently about two years of work. I judge the difference in my prospects in life between ±2 years of work savings to be totally insignificant in comparison to the impact of winning with bitcoin.
Maybe I am minimising the impact it would have on me if I lost my two years of accumulated capital. Anyway that's my reasoning.

If you want to borrow money from people, you have to offer a reason for them to give you their money. That incentive must exceed the incentive offered by simply holding money. So negative interest rates are never going to happen in a monetary economy free of central bank intervention.
Anyway, this is getting silly. People are always going to want to borrow money, lenders are going to want a return on their loan, the market will determine pricing. Expectations of deflation will be factored in. It's really not that complicated.

You would still see lending in the form of venture capital. Even a mortgage for a house can be a good investment if the borrower expects to turn a profit from avoiding rental repayments. The only difference would be the threshold of expected return required to take out a loan. Even if the market rate for a loan of let's say $1 million was 20% including deflation, there would still be investment prospects out there with higher expected returns. Sure, not as many as if the rate was 5% incl. deflation, but loans would still occur.

I like your optimism and imagination, but just to point out, when people save money through a cheaper service, they have to do something with the money they saved, so they will either buy or save/invest with that money. Therefore their total consumption stays constant unless they decide to increase their saving profile. However because the government targets almost all consumption and saving activities for taxation the taxation profile is only diversified, not reduced.
I.e. the easiest situation for the government would be if there was one employer for all people in society and one service provider. That would make taxation very easy. The more services people use and the more distributed their income sources become, the more complex taxation becomes. But the overall wealth of individuals doesn't inherently change as their consumption profile diversifies.
Totally agree that services like Uber are a serious challenge to government power, but I think what we're seeing is a consequence of the democratisation of cheap technology and the inevitable consequence that innovation by the masses outstrips government usage of that technology. Corrupt government power mostly just incentivises people to compete to wield that power, whereas almost everyone can benefit from innovating to help fight for freedom.

1. The banking system is an unstable cartel centered on control of the printing presses... *exactly* what Bitcoin is intended to disrupt... why you would use that as a counterexample?? Try another industry where free market conditions actually prevail, like for instance supermarkets. In most countries I know of there are just a few, often just two major players, something you seem to suspect would lead to "centralisation" and extortion of consumers, yet in actuality the competition between them results in razor-thin margins and primarily benefits consumers. 
2. I think you are a) underestimating the ability of the world to compete effectively with China and b) rehashing "yellow menace" racism here, but... China will make more money by letting Chinese miners mine than by trying to sieze control of the network and damaging the value of the currency. The incentives of the bitcoin system are designed to function at any scale, even the scale of nation states. If you don't believe me then I think you may need to educate yourself more about bitcoin.
3. I'm not sure what you intend by the term cryptocurrency, but a distributed currency like Bitcoin is absolutely new. All previous attempts to make free market currencies were centralised currencies owned by corporations, who folded at the first touch from jealous and suspicious nation state. Bitcoin is a genuinely new phenomenon and any comparisons are silly.
4. Ultimately it's largely irrelevant whether 10 or 10,000 people are core devs. If miners don't like the latest version, they won't run it, so the devs have to be confident they can get a majority of the network to run their latest changes. And the miners care about the maintaining the value of bitcoin and the value of the network, because if either of those are damaged their businesses will be destroyed. So ultimately the core devs are forced to write code that enhances the usability and attractiveness of bitcoin to normal people like you or me, because people will only use bitcoin, unlike fiat currencies, if it is actually attractive and beneficial to them.
5. The world has no need for multiple arbitrary sources of digital scarcity, so I don't expect anything to be able to effectively compete with bitcoin as a scarce token. However once the value of the coinbase becomes overshadowed by TX-fees, we can expect pegged sidechains to enable the emergence of multiple networks competing to process payments as efficiently as possible. The ultimate token will always be bitcoin but there is plenty of space for competition in processing technology.
I think you are struggling to understand the fundamental difference here between fiat, which is a monopolist product which has been hijacked by people with guns, and Bitcoin, which is a genuinely free market product which must be attractive to be accepted. No one will ever force the world to adopt Bitcoin at gunpoint, so Bitcoin can only succeed by being genuinely useful and desirable to the people who might choose to hold and use it. I know that after a lifetime of being forced to swallow shitty monopolist products it is hard to perceive and imagine just how well free markets work, but trust me, this is a gamechanger.

I'm actually a little confused, I can't quite work out with most of what you're saying whether you're asking me why a) in the current status quo transactions should pay fees higher than the lowest price miners will accept or b) in my proposed regimen Txs would pay anything higher than the network-determined minimum reward fee?
To answer the first interpretation, that is exactly the problem I've defined and which we've been discussing. In the absence of any requirement to pay towards an additional fund for network security, Tx fees will trend to the equilibrium price of paying a miner for the cost of validating and including the Tx, and will not fund security. We need transactions to pay an additional fee for a minimum block reward to fund security. 
My argument is about how the size of the block reward should be determined (I say democratic voting) and how it should be paid (I argue for a separate fee additional to Tx fees, which the miner of the current block cannot access.) So just to be clear there would be TWO fees - the normal Tx fee we have today, which the miner of the current block has, and an additional fee to fund the block reward for subsequent blocks, which the miner of that block *cannot* access. If the block reward was based on the KB size of the block, then the miner would not include Txs that did not pay the fee, or could only include them if other Txs had overpaid proportionally.
To answer the second interpretation:
1) The network will have agreed that blocks that do not satisfy the block reward gathering requirement will not be valid. So if a miner puts together a block which does not meet the current fee per kB requirement, other nodes will reject it.
2) People who think the network hashrate is too low or high (ie the network is under or overpaying for security) will be able to use the fee paid for the block reward to vote for their opinion. This means some people will overpay the fee. Some large entities with a strong interest in the health of the Bitcoin network (e.g. large corporations, Bitpay, Coinbase, et al) will conceivably pay significantly more than they need to, perhaps making transactions which only pay towards the reward. This system should have the same resilience as the Bitcoin network itself, most participants will be honest and vote for a fee which is optimal (i.e. enough security without overpaying), and even if one or more participants try to "crash" the system, other honest voters will act to counter their votes, and ultimately the attacker will just waste money which goes towards the support of the network.
Note that because some actors will overpay the reward, this will allow miners to accept some Txs which do not pay towards the reward.


There is no reason why the reward gathered in block n needs to be paid out 100% in block n+1. The reward could be paid out in lots of 10% from n+1...n+10, or 1% from n+1...n+100, or in any possible mathematical arrangement you like. Regardless, the chance of solving any given block is purely based on one's share of the network hashrate, and whether a miner has just solved a block or not it doesn't make a difference (like how flipping a tails does not make the next coinflip more likely to be tails.) So even if the reward is paid out in block n+1, unless there is some detail of how mining works I'm not familiar with, overall the mean block rewards are still being distributed evenly proportional to share of hashing power.
Additionally, the incentive will still remain for miners to include as many Txs as possible in the current block, as long as those Txs pay them a fee which equals or exceeds the cost of including the Tx.
Really appreciate your comments and critique by the way :)

As I mentioned, Bitcoin can offer a "safe harbour" - not complete protection to firms which displease the government, but because states cannot stop Bitcoin, it provides opportunities which attract firms to try and enter these different markets. Among other things there is some protection in numbers, and it also helps for these firms that they are not directly competing with the  government by trying to declare their tokens inherently value, but just offering representations of an existing commodity.
In general, the whole point of Bitcoin is to take away these prerogatives from governments, and that is a slow process, Bitcoin is just the thin end of the wedge, we also need a lot of businesses pushing the limits of what governments will accept, as well as popular dissatisfaction with government actions and subsequent resistance.
So I would say that this objection is not a deal-breaker, especially looking forward in a Bitcoin-success scenario, where governments suffer a lot of damage as their debasement revenues and their control over financial systems are progressively destroyed.


Companies going into this market would definitely want to challenge such a point in court. Why is what they do any different from the government issuing untraceable physical currency? It isn't, so government attempts to crack down on it are hypocritical. One cannot expect long-term democratic support for hypocritical government behaviour.


Anyone who wants to use Bitcoin for serious amount of money or for non-state-authorised activities would not be interested in relatively expensive representative tokens. This idea is primarily targeted for day-to-day financial activities for people who are highly accustomed to physical currency.
Furthermore, even if you did have problems with redeeming your coins, laundering would be dead simple, just sell your coins to someone who has a clean record. People who want to launder "dirty" money are a) not stupid and b) highly motivated. They will find lots of ways.


It's good that people are experimenting with forms of circulatable stored private keys, but ultimately there will always be a serious validation problem with such tokens limiting their usefulness for a simple physical currency alternative. A business which might issue such tokens could never guarantee they would honour the stated values if the private keys were secretly extracted (this is impossible, because the only way for an honest user to discover tampering is to break the tampering seals, and then how can it be proved who spent from the private key?)
With a representative token issued by a firm, redeemability is guaranteed by the firm, and validation is the same question as we have with current fiat tokens: does this look like a genuine token? If they are genuine, or look genuine enough, the firm will honour it, and then it is the firm's problem to make sure their tokens are hard to counterfeit.
@_date: 2015-02-18 13:30:26


Right, so that wouldn't work then. I didn't think of that. I think either a fee per Kb, or again the original idea of a simple minimum block reward, this should work if there are separate transaction streams, one to the miner of the current block, and one to pay the reward for the child block.


No, transaction fees do *not* pay for network security. Miners should be willing to accept any transaction whose fee equals or exceeds the price of including it. So over time the equilibrium transaction fee will equal this cost and nothing more. Therefore there must be some additional forced fee requirement to pay for network security. At the moment the forced fee is inflation. In the future, because Bitcoin assumes a fixed monetary base, we need some other way to enforce fees for network security. It has to happen.

@_date: 2015-02-01 16:15:24
That's not how a free market works. People compete to earn the rewards of mining by investing and developing mining infrastructure. Using cheap energy is a cost-saving exercise, just like the firms that compete to produce aluminium cans introducing new machinery which shaves 0.6 of a gram off the amount of alu needed for a can.
Fundamentally the amount of resources that will be invested into mining companies will match (with a small profit margin) the reward offered by mining. At the moment because the reward is relatively fixed and the price relatively volatile, mining investment is not very well matched to the actual value of the network. In the future, if Bitcoin succeeds, and once TX fees take over as the primary component of mining rewards (and subject to refinement of how fees work) we can hope for a network which very efficiently rewards its securers.

Um, I don't? That's why I didn't say there wouldn't be any, I said it would be impractical. Which I would argue it is in 99% of situations today. Anyway it's not really relevant, I'm just defining conditions for an analysis, an exercise you seem to struggle with...


1) We've never had a currency like Bitcoin.
2) People aren't perfect, and change is never instant, which is why it's best to speak of general trends. Note that Darwin didn't say "species are perfectly adapted," he said "species tend to adapt over time." 
3) We still have monopolist nation states :)


Have you actually read these? The natural competition of firms inevitably wipes out the first set (from "dumping" to "absorption" of competitor) completely. They're mostly just rehashes of cartelism, which has *mathematically* been proven to be unstable. And the second set (from "subsidies" to "quotas") are all *direct consequences* of government intervention. No interfering social institutions indeed! Good one mate!

What you said. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:23:54


The part you're quoting from is a thought experiment where everyone has agreed to pay a premium on the fee. I didn't say that this is likely, or practicable, or desirable, I just used it to show that, even if the system somehow got into such an improbable state, natural incentives would quickly reduce it to equilibrium fee cost. 


Did you even read the whole article? I note that point several times! I think if you paid attention you would have realised that the quoted transaction fee is a mutually-agreed upon value that is *higher* than the equilibrium (cost-covering) tx fee (because as mentioned it's part of a hypothetical scenario.)  I show how even given such a starting point, the result is unstable, and fees will decrease. 


Exactly. What I demonstrated is that in a system of purely voluntary network funding through fees, fees will trend to just covering the cost of including transactions, and there will be no premium for hashing, and thus no security.
As I mentioned, this is the first in a series of intended posts, so this article just focuses on a scenario of purely voluntary fees. It's important to refute this idea because it is such a common refrain in the community. The subsequent articles will round out the analysis by looking at other different possible methods for funding security. I hope if you choose to read them you will be a little clearer that it is possible to describe a hypothetical scenario for the purposes of refuting or finding weaknesses with it, without necessarily endorsing it :)

Gold is scarce in the sense that a king cannot simply decree it into existence, it requires ever-increasing human time and effort to extract gold from the ground. In contrast with fiat currency it is trivially easy to make as much of it as you want. Both gold and bitcoin are much better than fiat, bitcoin has major advantages over gold in other areas as a store of value and functional currency.

Highlights the long-term need for a marketplace of node services to ensure a healthy, sustainable p2p network. If nodes pay/are paid to receive/send eg block and tx data, then there would be no issue with pseudonodes, the pseudonodes would still need to get the data from somewhere, so even if they are paid for providing data they still have to pay the true node in turn.

I think it's a mistake to imagine bitcoin foreign bank accounts being anything like fiat bank accounts. If one country (eg the USA) is successful in regulating the activities of locally-based bitbanks, then that will give a bid edge to foreign competitors, and there's no possible way even today for a country that can barely control local *businesses* to prevent *people* from preferring unregulated overseas services, especially when the transferred token has no respect whatsoever for international trade controls and cannotly possibly be prevented from crossing borders.
Even today pretty much anyone around the world can open a Coinbase account and deposit and withdraw bitcoin from and to anywhere in the world. They have identity requirements which last I checked are providing a name and email. Give a fake one if you want. You'll ask what'll happen when the USG puts pressure on Coinbase? Well, Coinbase will either move to a more lenient jurisdiction or be outcompeted by a competitor in said jurisidiction.
I share your concerns about dangers of APTs and dying. For APTs I would say we'll just have to rely on development of systems built from the ground up to generate and handle private keys securely. Imagine a Trezor-esque module built into a smartphone. Or a trezor-chip for your Ara phone. Open-source will be critical here to ensure the highest standard of securitisation. For dying, I think we'll have to look into secret sharing for seeds. And I wouldn't worry so much about extortion, keep a low profile I guess, rich people today have equal problems with extortion and they get around it. Multi-sig should help.
There are lots of solutions out there, at the end of the day the solution isn't and is never going to be a small elite of old white men holding the keys to the kingdom.

Nice, good luck with it! For what it's worth, I (and many others) absolutely do not believe that the world has to collapse or the global economy implode in some sort of Mad Max scenario for Bitcoin to take over as the world money and people to stop using fiat. I believe that Bitcoin's growth can be part of an in general smooth and positive trend in global politics, as people organically develop a preference for a money that is open-source, constantly evolving, programmable, extremely cheap and fast to store and send, and virtually debasement-proof, versus fiat currencies, which are technologically stagnant, expensive and imprecise to transact in, and always highly vulnerable to volatile debasement.
The result would just mean that governments lose a major source of revenue and control, encouraging much more accountable and hopefully reduced governments. This would be a big positive for the world, the only people who will lose out are those who make a career out of profiting off of strong centralised government. Normal honest people will benefit.

No. I would like to take a look at this idea in a future post though I think.


I have some ideas on that one :)


There's always a cost, even if it's microscopic. My argument is that voluntary fees paid directly to the miner of the relevant block will always trend towards equalling this cost and no more. 


No one stays in business in the long run by doing unprofitable things, but yeah, like I said, miners cannot exert any upwards price pressure on tx fees beyond rejecting txs which do not cover the cost for them of including the tx.

The optimal, mutually-satisfactory and desired outcome of a decentralised, perfectly democratic competition between competing arbitrarily scarce tokens is the elevation of one token to preeminence.

There is a world of difference between Paypal (a centralised corporation inherently vulnerable to state coercion) and bitcoin (a distributed network run by miners around the world). You can't regulate a global network protocol run on open-source code. It would require a global coalition between every single state actor to force miners to run their fork of the bitcoin protocol. For a variety of reasons, never, ever, ever going to happen. Governments just aren't that smart or that responsive. They are dinosaurs and they are dying.

I don't think you understand lending. Deflation is really irrelevant because interest stacks on top of it. E.g. if I am going to borrow some money at interest so I can buy industrial goods with the money, I need to be sure that the eventually I can earn back enough money to pay back the loan. If the price of money is increasing, then I have to try and factor that into my calculations about whether I should take the loan or not. So if the deflation rate is 3% and the interest rate I can get for a loan is 10%, then I need to be confident the venture will make at least a 13% return.

Pretty wrong. Each bitcoin TX is just a list of inputs and outputs which must be equal. There is no accounting for "which Satoshis went to which addresses." Furthermore coin mixing will make these histories completely meaningless.

I think you are a little mixed up on how efficiency gains will play out here. If there is cheaper energy in Iceland, yes, people will move there, but then they will wind up using more of that energy. Fundamentally mining firms will spend as much money as they have to to remain competitive, which inevitably winds up being almost the reward they receive from mining. They might pay less for some resources because they've moved to more efficient forms of them, but they will then either buy more of that resource (increased power consumption for more ASICs) or buy more of something else (more Silicon Valley engineers to optimise their systems.)
Do you see?

1. Bitcoin banks will serve global markets. I'd like to see how much luck your jealous spouses will have when your Bitcoin bank is in (let's say) Mongolia, and they're in (let's say) Argentina.
2. If Apple can design their phones so that they physically cannot decrypt a phone without the AppleID password, then Bitcoin bank accounts can be designed which physically cannot be spent from without the 2FA/password/etc. authorisation.
3. Many of these problems will get better anyway - the power of nation states will continue to weaken as the world moves to Bitcoin, and their control over money printing and the financial system evaporates. The nation states remaining (if any) in the aftermath will be shadows of their current power.
Furthermore, let's not forget why Bitcoin is great: individuals like you who desire the highest level of personal control can achieve that, and no one will ever be able to stop you, while solutions that cater to you will only get better and better. At the same time services which work for the everyman will *still* improve on the current bank system, and will help to grow the userbase of Bitcoin, which we all benefit from.

1) Speculation smoothes out market fluctuations, creating more stable prices. It's been given a nasty name but it's a healthy part of any economy.
2) In the environment where a) money supply is fixed and b) theft is impractical, those who waste their resources suffer and those who use them wisely prosper. Those who fall prey to emotions and contribute to bubbles suffer and those who remain level-headed prosper. Ceteris parabis, over time there is natural selection for intelligent economic behaviour.
It's only in an environment where large social institutions exert coercive power over populations that these feedbacks are decoupled and dysfunctional economic behaviours persist. I don't think you understand just how extremely our societies are distorted by these factors.
@_date: 2015-02-07 13:25:00
1. The future is bitcoin, not fiat. Fiat currencies will die due to the overwhelming incentives of all actors in society other than governments to prefer bitcoin. So any issues involving fiat &lt;=&gt; bitcoin transfers are purely temporary, the only chokepoints that nation states can still police effectively. Once the world has transitioned to bitcoin as the sole arbitrarily valued scarce token, the game is up.
2. No, it can't. Banning coin mixing will be similar to banning torrenting, i.e., absurdbly impractical. Even if you ignored the fact that it would boil down to a government needing to exercise direct violent coercion over massive sections of the popualce (impossible) the practice of trying to tie bitcoin addresses to individuals would be so fallible the enterprise would be completely laughable.
3. As I said, bitcoin will undermine the power of entities like the USG. It will create irresistible incentives for countries to defect from the USG cartel, something you have alluded to. If the USG can barely stop people using torrent sites with servers in Sweden in 2015, how is it supposed to stop people from using bitcoin wallets with automatic mixing running on servers hosted in (low-orbit balloons, satellites, mesh networks, whatever) in 2035?
Violent authority has been losing power for a long time. One of the big reasons is that on average human beings are generous and caring, and so any organisation whose business is suppression inevitably becomes dominated by lousy people. Those people are unimaginative and can never match the creativity and innovation of the principled masses, so they always wind up depending upon crude tools of suppression, like guns.
Money supply is the last crutch of these assumed authorities, the last way they can maintain control without having to directly confront their citizenries. Once their printing presses are rendered useless, governments have no other options than a direct battle to maintain control. No matter how powerful they seem today, they have no chance whatsoever of winning this fight.

Okay. So:
Firstly, you implied that Bitcoin network security is derived from the creation of new bitcoin. This is actually false. Hashing power proportional to network value (i.e. price) is what provides security. You are likely confused because currently, nodes are rewarded (i.e. incentivised) for commiting hashing power to the network by the creation of receiving newly created coins. However note that in the future nodes will be incentivised through transaction fees (and likely other fees for network services.)
Secondly, you implied that the value of fiat currency is secured through the creation of new fiat currency. Again, this is false. Fiat currency would remain just as valuable, and would actually become worth more, if all printing stopped immediately. The true "protector" of fiat "network security" are the militarised nation states who guard their monopoly over the right to print money, hunting for and prosecuting private actors who try and usurp this right (i.e. "counterfeiters"). You can understand this by imagining what would happen if no one would be punished or deterred in any way from printing their own fiat currency. Because this would be an extremely profitable enterprise, multiple firms would quickly enter the marketplace, printing as much money as they could. This would quickly devalue all existing tokens of the fiat, and within short order the currency would be worthless.
Now naturally it costs a lot of money to pay for all these people with guns and all the various people who try and discover counterfeiting and all the various efforts required to hunt down and deter would-be counterfeiters. You might even note that nation states use the money they create in part to fund these militarised components (which would be a better comparison to the funding of Bitcoin nodes through coinbase rewards). 
I am not saying these direct costs are as high as the price the Bitcoin network pays its miners, but I wanted you to see that the fiat "network" also requires ongoing expenses to maintain its "security".

2) Regardless, seriously? Your average constable maybe doesn't carry a firearm, of course we're talking about someone who's combat trained and probably carrying at the very least a baton and mace, and will exert violence against you if you resist them. And if they want to they can carry firearms, of course if they have any real worry about being able to exert force on you there's be armed offender units with full combat gear, ranged sniper support and submachine guns. Oh and you know there's also the military. They have some guns I believe.
3) Britain and Britain's well-behaved colonies often do have police forces that don't commonly carry weapons. The reason they don't need to is that they have strict controls on firearm possession by non-state agents and docile populations who submit to this power disparity.

1. If the reward was a percentage of input value or transaction data size, then making more transactions would increase the size of the reward. The miner doing the upvoting wouldn't just get the reward back, it would go to whoever mined the next block.
2. You could separate the transaction fee which goes to the miner from the fee to pay for the block reward. Miners who forfeit a down-vote containing transaction would therefore be forfeiting their own fees. The incentive would be stronger to accept the transactions because the overall impact on the miner of the reward decrease would be outweighed by the value of those transactions.
@_date: 2015-02-08 07:04:59
I don't understand this idea. If you're using bitcoin as an intermediary, you can incur exchange fees on both ends of the transaction, and you STILL have the problem that unless currency flows are exactly equal, eventually you will need to actually swap Fiat A for Fiat B. If we're transferring, let's say AUD into EUD, then effectively our transfer service is doing this: buying AUD off of us (which they hold) for bitcoin, then selling that bitcoin for EUD (which they give to us). If the demand for AUD-&gt;EUD is higher than EUD-&gt;AUD, the exchange provider will build up a surplus of AUD. Eventually those AUD need to be directly swapped for EUD, which means we're back at the same antiquated exchange mechanisms. Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:22:30
As the other commenter pointed out, we're unlikely to hit $5 million in the 25-era.
However you've raised a very important point. Because the block reward algorithm is completely set in stone, the amount the network pays for security fluctuates in lockstep with the price. For example at the moment the network pays 10% of its value p/a to fund security. You could argue that this is a good or a bad thing.

Our current system of monies is a hangover from an epoch of authority by divine right. We might for the most part have gotten rid of kings and queens, but the "democratic" nation states that replaced them have largely inherited or come to assume the same prerogatives and failure points. 
The most important of these prerogatives has been the right to monopolise the printing presses, criminalising free market monies. Because of the critical value of money to economies, this power is the greatest any political actor can possess, the lynchpin to the continued survival and dominance of nation states. "With great power comes great responsibility", and all governments have been seduced into abusing this power and responsibility, at the expense of the wealth and wellbeing of their citizenries. It is only due to the insidious and dispersed nature of this damage, the complicity of citizenries in both demanding and being seduced by illusions of economic free lunches and easy fixes, and the difficulty of composing a solution to the problem, that governments have not been overthrown for these abuses.
Bitcoin is a breath of fresh air to the status quo. It is a solution to this problem, a single token the entire world can settle upon, which is immune to the political pressures and dangers which inevitably destroy centralised currencies. It is a guaranteed scarce commodity, which people will actually want to hold, unlike fiat currency, which people are constantly trying to flee from with bonds, stocks, and housing (creating useless, damaging economic distortions in the markets for these assets). Technologically it is almost infinitely superior and infinitely more future-ready than any fiat currency will ever be. Because it belongs to no one and everyone, anyone who chooses to hold it has an incentive to support and improve it. In contrast, fiat currencies only benefit the governments who control the printing presses.
The world only needs one arbitrarily overvalued scarce token, and Bitcoin has the momentum, the community, the network-effect, and the brand to be that token. It offers a sound, functional money, and an end to destructive government control are something which will benefit everyone on Earth, so the incentives motivating people to support and value Bitcoin are overwhelming.
The crowd is smarter than any government bureau. We are moving away from epochs of top-down control and distortion of economies, into an era of ever-increasing liberty, away from an era which corruptible government architects ostensibly "managed" and "cured" economic ills, to a time of flexible, organically developed and consensual systems. Bitcoin is a critical piece of that transition, because by adopting it we cut off governments from their ability to shield themselves from their dysfunction by endlessly printing more money. Bitcoin is the beginning of the end for the useless and destructive reign of government.

Yes it is.


No, for all of the reasons I gave above. One is the legacy offshoot of violent authoritarianism, the other is a free market product run as a distributed network. They're worlds apart.


Because centralisation (really just another word for *specialisation*) can proceed until there are only two effective competitive entities in a marketplace and the marketplace functions just fine. Centralisation is a feature of healthy free markets but centralisation != coercive monopoly. They're completely different phenomena.


They shut down cryptographically-bashed digital currencies which were issued by private corporations. They could shut down these companies by sending people with guns to their offices. They can't "shut down" Bitcoin because it is an open protocol run on a network of computers across the entire world, secured by a massive amount of computing power which scales to match the value of the network. Again, we're talking about oranges and apples.


The only attack that means anything is 51% dominance of the network. And the incentives of Bitcoin ensure that any entity that attempts such an attack will always be seduced into simply using the computing power it gains to mine.

I define network security as a sufficiently high difficulty level to make it so costly for an attacker to subvert transactions that most users are satisfied with the time required for confirmation of day-to-day transactions. Currently the coinbase reward attracts competitive hashing power, fulfilling this need. As noted by Satoshi, the coinbase will decrease. What will replace it? Satoshi suggested transaction fees. I started this series of posts because voluntary transaction fees (Satoshi's implied solution) won't work and the community needs to think of what to do instead.

Even if the majority of people wind up holding coins with bitcoin banks, much of the benefits of Bitcoin will still be realised. 
Firstly, as long as banks are just building services on top of the core protocol, and the core remains decentralised and incorruptible, and money supply remains capped, no government will be able to take over the network, and thus we will avoid the principle vulnerability of fiat systems  - that people respond to bank failures by agitating for political oversight and "universal" insurance of bank deposits. Instead people will be forced to realise the importance of researching and monitoring one's choice of bank, because there will be no way to force wider society to socialise bank losses. This will ensure a properly competitive market for bank services where banks with poor security or reckless lending will go out of business, and awareness of the risks of losing one's money will force people to choose carefully.
Secondly, the core architectural features of the network will enable much more secure and technologically advanced banks than ever before.
@_date: 2015-02-07 10:33:42
Nope. You underestimate how much governments benefit from controlling the printing press. They can always print enough money to cover deficits, always print enough to fund any new scheme they want, and they hold the true nuclear option - destruction of the currency - as a threat to keep populations in line.
This power is the heart of modern governments. Without it they have no options for retaining control other than direct violent confrontation. This is a non-starter, simply because governments will never be as powerful, as innovative, as committed, as principled, as resilient nor as flexible as whole populations.
I expect it to be a mortal wound when they lose the printing press. Maybe not straight away, but eventually. Governments have been weakening for a long time, and the end is approaching.

You clearly don't understand Bitcoin...
1) Those "Bitcoin enthusiasts" are some of the world's most successful and cutting edge people. If you'd actually watched the whole video they give several very helpful hints as to the value potential of Bitcoin. Writing it off as a "circlejerk" is dumb. Watch the whole video ffs.
2) You don't understand mining difficulty at all. You honestly have no idea what you're talking about. Difficulty scales with hashing power. Hashing power follows price. So when the price goes down, as now, hashing power will drop, and so will difficulty. Because the incentive to subvert the network is also proportional to value, there is no impact on network security.
3) Re: dishonesty - sorry mate but every gold rush attracts crooks. There were people in California in the gold rush then running around trying anything to get some gold. People pretending to be immigration officers and tricking Chinese miners out of gold they had spent years accumulating. None of that hurt the value of gold (because it was a *product* of gold's desirability). Similarly, none of that will hurt Bitcoin. It's like saying a band will never be successful because they have too many groupies and imitators (because they're already successful.) It makes no sense.
4) Um... having never myself talked about "whales"... maybe you should ask those questions to someone who has? Anyway if I would have to hazard a guess, the difference here is that: bitcoin is easy for anyone to buy. It's been about as easy for anyone to acquire since the value was a few cents per coin. So anyone has the opportunity to benefit by being smart and getting in early. Yes, if you have more money to start out you can buy more, but everyone has exactly the same risk and potential return for every dollar they put in. This is an investment potential which will reward the smart, the brave, the forward-thinking, and *especially* those who truly believe in freedom.
If I were you I wouldn't worry about ups and downs, buy as much as you can, aim to never sell, keep putting your spare money into it, and never sell. There is no reason to ever sell bitcoin. Just hold it indefinitely and you will do very nicely.

Governments get away with it by raising taxes, fudging the books, obscuring cause and effect, and, for the coup de grace, printing money.

1) Blacklisting or ID requirements like you describe could only ever be implemented in off-chain bitcoin banks like Coinbase. They are completely antithetical to the ethos and architecture of bitcoin, and will never be implemented in the protocol. Even if someone tried, the miners would never accept it. So governments could only hope to "tame" bitcoin like this if they could somehow unite to force every single miner in the entire world to run their fork. Never going to happen.
2) Coin mixing will make it impossible to pinpoint specific wallet balances for blacklisting.
3) The only effect that an authority can hope to have by enforcing onerous regulations within its jurisdiction will be to ensure that all bitcoin businesses within its borders are competitively disadvantaged. See for example Coinjar. An Australian business, they relocated to the UK immediately after the Australian govt. announced a 10% GST on all bitcoin purchases. They moved to the UK because that jurisdiction is more favourable towards open bitcoin innovation. If they had to, they will move again.
4) The nature of bitcoin businesses will be global, we will have bitcoin wallet providers from competing from Argentina from providers from Mongolia. The only reason we have problems at the moment is the world transitioning from fiat, which is dominated by regional authorities, into bitcoin, which never can be.
Governments couldn't ban or control bittorrent, only hamper it, and they can't ban or control bitcoin.

1) Mining centralisation is a non-issue. Like all other industries we will probably wind up with a few major players, businesses with hundreds of thousands of bitcoins invested who compete at ultra-efficient scale with each other. This is the most efficient market outcome, observed in countless instances, it has worked fine in the past and will work equally fine for bitcoin.
2) If you're so worried about monoculture among the devs, why not get involved submitting push requests to the protocol? I doubt you will though because again it takes a lot of investment in time and effort to learn and get up to speed and start contributing usefully. So naturally again we will see a relatively small number of people actively contributing (as in all open source projects) - people who for whatever reason can justify what is in effect high-profile volunteer work.
3) Similarly, why not start an alternative bitcoin foundation to solicit donations and distribute funds to your preferred developers? Again, I doubt you will, because the barrier to entry for a new comer is pretty huge and the added value they can offer is pretty minimal.

Like I said, it depends upon your evaluation of the odds. You think there's a 1:35 chance of winning. I think the chance is actually better than that. No worries, each to his own.
I would like to point out that even with 1:35 odds, if you accept the probability of a 100-1000x "payout," then it is still a good bet. For each dollar wagered you would expect on average a 65-965 dollar payout.

You always run the risk of not buying back in before a big price rise, and with Bitcoin it's hard to say when and how quickly that rise will happen. The likely price of bitcoin post-moon is so many orders of magnitude higher than today I personally think it's smarter just to sit tight and play it safe.

The eye can only see what the mind is prepared to accept. If you cannot see the economic destruction wrought by nation states, or that the lynchpin of their power is their monoply over monies, then I am sorry for you.

The current range of awesome, mostly-free internet services available to the entire world is the result of hundreds of companies doing everything in their power to capture users for themselves over the last ~30 years. Why demonise something that always benefits the consumer in the end?

This has nothing to do with whether we should use the core network to settle small payments. That's a separate issue. Arbitrarily restricting the rate of transactions processed to try and get a sufficient block reward is a hack, and will *always* be a hack. How many transactions do you allow? How do you change the amount allowed if people want more or less hashing power?
We secure the network by paying the miners, so we should focus on building a mechanism to ensure they are paid. Trying to mix in the issue of limiting transactions is confusing completely separate issues.

Why should a government steal retirement funds et al when they can just print more cash and steal everyone's money without anyone noticing

The system of militarised entities that prevents non-state fiat creation is pretty expensive, both in direct and indirect costs... if it were to stop functioning your fiat would be worthless within weeks if not days.

It's useful to go back to basics here. The aim of economic activity is not just to make everyone busy, but to let each person use the resources available to them to obtain the greatest possible improvement in the circumstances of their existence.
Reckless, incorrectly incentivised lending create economic bubbles. Careless lenders throw too much money into ventures with poor prospects, leading to resources being actively *wasted*. And when I mean wasted, I really mean wasted. If you built a bunch of office blocks that no one uses because, fundamentally, you are part of a system which knows that the government will save you with the printing press when you fuck up, you've wasted energy, raw materials, and human time and effort. Most of those inputs will never be recouped. You've only been saved personally from the direct consequences of your actions because the government impoverished everyone proportional to your losses to save your balance sheet.
What would actually happen if Bitcoin (or any fixed supply money) supplanted fiat currencies is that frivolous and wasteful economic activity would decrease, replaced by smart investments. People would realise, when governments were unable to rescue failed policies with the printing press, that central decision-makers were not creators of wealth but destroyers. Economic activity would not decrease, it would become smarter, more efficient, and more beneficial, for everyone capable and willing to take advantage of opportunities, leading to a greater and smoother increase in prosperity than ever before experienced.

The SNI is a group of friends. Calling Michael Daniel's "boss" is stupid. 
Anyway it's lampooning the practice of lashing out at bitcoin-holders for being "greedy" or "hoarding" by drawing the correct historical precedent to how the exact same stupid things were said about successful Jewish businessmen.
If you don't have a taste for satire and irony then you will struggle to understand or enjoy the SNI.

You might, though I doubt it, be right. Even if you are, I don't think it's particularly important. Why? Well, Bitcoin will probably become the world's money (i.e. the single arbitrary token of digital scarcity that people collectively choose to value. Once this happens, people will give up trying to compete with it by producing and marketing rival sources of digital scarcity. Then it gets interesting. People will start using pegged sidechains to convert bitcoin into other tokens (all backed by bitcoin,) with which they can test hypotheses about more reliable way to secure a transaction ledger. What I see coming is ultimately a web of pegged chains, all inheriting their fundamental scarcity from the bitcoin blockchain, creating a free market in which the most effective ideas for processing and securing transaction history will prevail. That way we can have all the benefits of a scarce token without the drawbacks of a lack of competition. Cake = eaten.

Nothing is free. The security of a public distributed ledger is not free either. The question is really how much you would find reasonable to pay. Considering that this is a system which we might reasonably desire to support *an entire planet's worth of financial transactions and account balances,* I think it's actually quite a bargain.
Edit: and luckily, because ultimately the price paid to support the ecosystem will be determined by TX fees, and because the code is open-source, we have the opportunity, as a community, to iterate and find the most favourable balance between security and cost.
@_date: 2015-02-20 01:11:33


1. I think there would be a large number of people, including many large entities, who *would* care about network security, would be willing to put their money where their mouth is, and counteract those who just want cheap fees. Look at what happened after [Heartbleed]( for instance. 
2. If the network is processing a lot of transactions, fees would probably still be very small, so a lot of users would probably be content with the current fee and not vote it down.
3. Popular wallets might not even expose this functionality to users (or hide it in settings, and we all know how many people stick with default settings...) and instead make decisions on behalf of their userbase. 
4. People who want to downvote the reward are probably going to pay the minimum or below-minimum fee, making their vote less effective.
Anyway until something like this is tried I don't believe we can know for sure what the results would be in terms of user response.


I suspect that Tx fees would actually be quite stable in my scenario. I certainly wouldn't expect large spikes or dips. Regardless, if the blocksize limit was removed, then any Tx that pays below the base fee needs a corresponding Tx paying a premium to allow a miner to include their Tx. The basic dynamic is the same as with a classical Tx fee, if you want more speed and certainty, pay a premium. Otherwise you can trade off cost for the risk of waiting longer or never being confirmed.
On another note it should be possible again to smooth out the results of voting to avoid large spikes or dips.


If two chains are being worked on in parallel, both chains will overwhelmingly receive the same transactions at roughly the same time, and thus the results of voting should be the same for both chains. I don't think block reorgs are a big deal to be honest, at the end of the day if you want to pay a small premium on the reward fee to safeguard against the small risk of a block reorg, you can.


If my analysis is right, the network will not be sustainable in the long run without some big changes to the way hashing power is funded. Ultimately the network will accept a new consensus characteristic if miners can be convinced that it is necessary to do so to preserve the value of their operations, so I don't see that as being a dealbreaker at all. The alternative is outcompetition at the hands a more rationally-designed processing network once sidechains come into play. If I'm right about this issue, then something has to be done, whether it's my idea or not. I think my take is pretty good, I'm sure there are other ways of tackling it, but if you agree with me that something has to be done then the only question is what.


Would they? Miners and full nodes would perform all the real calculations, and the minimum fee and voting result could be included as a trivial amount of extra information in each block (possibly in the block header?) SPV clients already make a trade off between trustlessness and low resource use, why would getting data about the current state of minimum fees be more problematic than verifying Txs without the full blockchain?

There is a lot of altruism in society, but there is also a lot of free-riding. If you sit down and compare systems reliant on altruism to systems reliant on incentivising participants that the former systems are constantly shaky and unstable. Wikipedia for example is always struggling for funding, more editors, etc etc. Leveraging altruism can be powerful (many people believe in the ideal of free information and feel good about creating free wiki articles) but the result never comes easily. You are most often fighting uphill with human nature.
I'm not saying that altruism won't or can't play a role in bolstering and propelling Bitcoin's success. It can and clearly has. I'm saying that pinning one's hopes primarily on altruism is dangerous. Do you really think Bitcoin would have done so well if Satoshi had decided to award miners with likes and karma points instead of a scarce token? I doubt it. In fact the distribution of rewards to nodes is precisely an example of how well a system works when its participants are correctly incentivised, and altruism is *not* relied upon.
We need a stable, reliable economic foundation for Bitcoin's security, and altruism is not that foundation. It is supplementary at best.
