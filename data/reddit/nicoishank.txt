“Hi, I’m Bitcoin! While all you nerds ask the same six generic questions based on different mindsets of investing, I simply DO NOT CARE. I do what I WANT, like RATM, “fuck you I won’t do what you tell me”

I know not to sell all together, that is obvious, but what about selling at highs and buying back at lows? I want to keep it going, definitely. You’ll have helped, at least helped me help myself. I’m in. I wish I could buy music equipment with BTC. Someday....

Robinhood is a low fee app but only 8-10 of major cryptos are available for purchase, including BTC. I use coinbase and have been waiting bit eventually transfer to Robinhood

I was talking about a strategy for me, not bitcoin. Bitcoin gives no fucks and I will apply what I think is best to my future investments with that knowledge

Total noob but trying to stay positive when I read daily discussions and people either act matter of factually about it crashing or complaining about low prices. I set a date in ten years to sell, if I even ever do. I would like to not loose money over ten years. Any thoughts?
@_date: 2019-10-16 23:36:21
Could you elaborate at all? I understand
D the concept but not as much pertaining to BTC?
@_date: 2019-10-16 21:17:06
Why have billions....when you can have millions?

Hey ss794346 I’m trying to get opinions. I have-   .15 BTC, I keep adding to it every so often, nothing I can’t loose. Anyway, I plan to cash out in ten years. Good idea? If more places accept it, I will also just keep it, but any thoughts?

So is there any equation or math period, when people claim it will go &gt;100,000. I’m just about at $200 profit, only 1000 usd invested. I don’t know whether to HODL or sell. These forums seem like this to me: 
Me: I wish I knew what to do with my BTC. 
Reddit. YEAH SAME.

Hoping you are telling the truth, what I can I do for the community due to my faith in BTCs advantages over the USD? Also don’t hate the dollar, but know it has more applicable uses at this time. I can’t wait for the day where I can buy my groceries or pay my mortgage with BTC. And I also laugh because the USD is backed only by the military and US gov assets, is it not? If it is the case isn’t it backed by “nothing,” where BTC is at least backed by data? I’m new but trying to learn.

So if I take the $18k spike and go to the most recent 14k spike, not exact numbers I know I know, it’s clearly a downward trend. what am I missing?
@_date: 2019-09-15 18:09:39
The same people who told me to just set a date and sell then are scared of bears
