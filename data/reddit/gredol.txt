Freelance + Bitcoin = Win
See some of my work here 
@_date: 2014-01-02 13:05:17
Yes, it would be printed 1,2m in diameter and 1cm between lines.
Those lines in the end are meant for writing notes yes.
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:20:07
Maybe, but it has to start somewhere.
@_date: 2014-02-16 00:44:37
Well played Gox 
@_date: 2014-06-09 19:38:00
Smart move :)
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:26:53
I can still resize it and can even print different sizes.
@_date: 2014-12-15 10:29:34
I didn't quit my regular job yet but in my "free" time I do freelance graphic design for bitcoin and since then I never looked back.
See my portfolio here: 
@_date: 2017-03-31 09:43:19

@_date: 2017-09-12 08:01:30
Make sure you generate it on a computer that will never be online again and destroy the printer.
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:28:35
Yep its pretty bad... original chain will have no new blocks for days.
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:38:24

@_date: 2018-02-27 08:34:23

@_date: 2018-07-20 07:43:42
FACT: Bitcoin can and could do everything what every shitcoin do!
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:03:34
Its just a temporary bump like last one from 7.4 to 9k
Then down to 5k
@_date: 2018-04-13 05:49:25
And he was right about 10k in 2017 which he announced I think in 2014?
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:47:33
Cnbc saying we bottomed? That really scares me :(
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:39:59
He is known to crash prices... 
@_date: 2018-04-19 07:54:35
I see a lot of "we bottomed" talk lately and this really scares me.
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:41:10
Sell the news!
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:31:57

@_date: 2015-02-22 17:43:54
I've been accepting btc for over a year and got lots of work from bitcointalk and ofc jobs4bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:56:47

@_date: 2015-10-29 21:41:35

@_date: 2019-05-03 09:57:11
Oldy but goldy
@_date: 2019-05-09 06:26:34
Beside 7k btc he also lost every bit of credibility and respect. RIP
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:49:50
Bitpay will be dead in 3 years
@_date: 2017-06-27 07:54:31
Giving even more power to miners...
