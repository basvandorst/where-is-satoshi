USD can invade or at least nuke BTC
@_date: 2018-09-17 06:26:15
WTF? How is that not common sense?

Spoken like someone who's family worked 2 generations ago. 
*New money* disgusts me

The market cap of USD is higher, which is why the amount of money used to manipulate USD is many multitudes higher.

Thanks :)

Comparing the Bitcoin to the USD and the Bolivar in the same sentence is laughable. 
Do you sincerely believe the USD is manipulated to the same extent as Bitcoin... or would you like to take that back?

Dude.... What is the flavour of your Koolaid? 
@_date: 2018-05-09 17:10:52
That's retarded.... by definition.

Free Markets are much more vulnerable to corruption, influence and abuse.
@_date: 2018-05-06 21:12:29
Why would you think it's OK (or safe for the average person) to depend on a *currency* that's value can be manipulated so easily?

Oh man, this is dark. 8 years ago, I lived with a group of ass holes and I had some **shitty** friends who were (to be kind) abrasive leeches. My desk looked like this. 
This is someone who feels completely worthless and alone. 
It's tempting to call them a slob but if you ever have a roommate or a friend whose desk/room looks like this, ask them if everything is ok, help/make them clean up then watch a movie/show with them. It'll be 90 awkward gross minutes for you but it might be the most important thing that ever happens to them.
Sometimes people need help. It's evil to shit on them instead of helping them. If you can't stand them and are usually loud or rude to them, at least do nothing.

Learning grammar will help you.

You live in an awesome place but the one limitation is that you can only have one car. Why have you not sold the place for bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:18:02
Why not cool?
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:18:51
No, I bought in at 8K and sold out when it dipped back to 8. 
 Bitcoin having a future and it being a legitimate way for me to store my wealth are different things.

He took surviving on the streets as a meth head as far as a *meth*od actor such as himself should.

Buying the store isn't bad.

Then I would switch banks.

The idea that a legitimate bank cannot supply a customer with $3500 is insane. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 06:26:32
This is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-04-20 06:36:09
This looks like breakfast without bacon, eggs, coffee, beans or a sword, **WTF** are you thinking?

Too hostile for someone smoking weed. 
Only 1 language spoken.
Doesn't own more than $10 in crypto. 
Once pooed in a vengeful fashion.

You definitely pooed in a vengeful fashion.

Terrorists and pedos use bitcoin, now North Korea?

Downvoted for not being a Vegeta meme

What if I told you 2019 was bullshit?
