Incentive structure.
I also don't claim to care about whether bitcoin could have prevented this; that's just something you seem to be pushing for, possibly spoiling for a flamewar. All I know is that I personally need a store of wealth to protect against inflation. These are the sorts of the things that socialize losses and privatize gains(so long as you're in bed with government).

Comes down to blockchain size and decentralization. Double the size and you have half the time till LN comes to deal with it. Also, once you double the size and have a bigger blockchain, that is irreversible (at least while maintaining the way bitcoin works right now) and you'll always have a behemoth of a blockchain to synch.
**Don't underestimate how dangerous centralization can be.** 
There are monied institutions and governments that would pounce on bitcoin as soon as it was fundamentally weak and vulnerable. Venezuela showed a clear example of this when it started arresting and jaling bitcoin miners. Their government is weak. Imagine EU, US and China governments deciding that they'd had enough of bitcoin. This has been done before in history when FDR forcibly seized gold from citizens under Executive Order 6102. I use the word seized because he decided what the price was and forced everyone to submit their gold to govt. It is NOT hot air. 
You never know, it is not impossible that this is already the case with all these attacks we're seeing; at the very least and almost as a guarantee, they're learning from Roger exactly what to do to take down a network like BTC and that is why we're desperately in need of layer 2 solutions.
We therefore must ask, of all the properties that bitcoin has and the advantages it has, which ones are more important to preserve and which ones can we afford to temporarily stave off until LN comes?
**Store of wealth vs P2P**
Bitcoin, like gold, is a store of wealth but is also a p2p money transfer solution albeit a poor one at this time. There are better money transfer solutions compared to bitcoin and bitcoin cash; paypal, mpesa mobile money and bank wires do a significantly better job of it than crypto under certain and as a matter of fact, most circumstances. 
What they don't do is store your wealth devoid of govt inflation and large institutions' malpractice as was the case in the 2008 financial crisis. This was indeed one of the fundamental reasons why btc was created by Satoshi in the first place - something bitcoin cash proponents conveniently forget to mention.
All this doesn't take away the fact that BTC will be used as an effective payment mechanism at some point. That is why LN is such an important part of the conversation. It solves this problem. and other similar teams are working to bring this to fruition.

@_date: 2017-12-18 20:34:11
I started replying to you and it became too long so I posted this instead: 
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:17:07
Taxation started out nobly when it was at a minimum and monies collected were used for things that would be hard (but not impossible) to do via the private sector such as; judicial services, defense and law enforcement. When a society introduces collective welfare and healthcare among other things that individuals should be responsible for at the family level, it burdens hard workers and rewards dullards thereby distorting the entire fabric of incentive to be productive in a society. Couple that with unrestricted immigration and a rather flawed Trump makes more sense than 99.9% of all politicians in the establishment - save for people like Ron and Rand.
I'm not even white and stereotypically, based on my demographic, I should want these things i.e. welfare,  immigration, UBI, and all that's insane. This however goes beyond race and comes down to the fact that this is a systematic destruction of western civilization which has demonstrably contributed so much to humanity's progress.
I love Monero so much and I'll be investing soon. Bitcoin however has the largest usage/merchant-acceptance as far as I can tell based on daily volume alone (I'm certain there are other ways to qualify this) combined with decentralization meaning that even if govt were to severely crack down on crypto as a whole, bitcoin would likely still be the most useful and the safest coin. BTC is semi-anonymous and there are ways to make do with just that alone for now. Hopefully with features like atomic swaps coming to fruition alongside the growth of alts like Monero in the future, there can be more options. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:55:49
I absolutely love it. Leonardo does bloody fantastic job. Don't like the real Jordan Belfort though.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:33:19
Hands down the best way to describe BTC as of this moment. It is more ideological and practical than it is anything else. ideological because you have to see the old monetary system for horror-show it is and practical because, P2P already exists and is pretty good as described above! BTC sucks as a competitor for FREQUENT P2P transactions. It excels in edge-case P2P transfers such as cross-border TXs to places where no banking infrastructure is existent among other similar scenarios. For these, LN will solve this problem.
The primary objective and innovation that BTC offers that ALL OTHER traditional monetary systems cannot provide is DECENTRALIZATION. Once we take care of that, everything else follows.

It is both. It is possible to contribute to the bitcoin.org site and indicate which wallets have implemented segwit and that they should be highlighted as being cheaper and faster.
This is a eureka moment. More time and effort should be spent on there and not on here by all and sundry.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:06:53

@_date: 2017-12-21 12:12:50


If they gave 2 shits about speed and capacity, segwit would've been the first thing they did before anything else, like adding new alts, because bitcoin is the largest coin as it is.
There is no logic to their approach except that they clearly have it out for bitcoin and want to destroy it. Anything contrary to this opinion is likely disingenuous or misinformed.
If they did segwit and came back to say, 'nah, this won't cut it even for the short term', then there'd be a warranted conversation in their favor.
Fucke'm. Now they got me riled up.

Good. Now that we've established one needs to communicate with actual words as opposed to telepathy we can have a conversation. You've admitted that you're already using it as a store of value. It is btc's primary use for which you're happy to take advantage of. I go a step further and suggest that that property is so essential it should be protected at all costs. Trying to imagine that a network that has $300b in value(and growing) won't be attacked is rather naive. You should want that above all else.
There is a problem with btc as a payment mode. No one denies that, hence LN. Unless you are against LN (yet even Ver wants it on bch) then I fail to see what the argument is.

Money was used to reward perpetrators of the fraud depicted here. This money was printed out of thin air and debased any currency you yourself might have been holding at the time. 
Bitcoin protects your wealth and promotes a positive incentive structure as opposed to what is shown here: deliberate bad behaviour is rewarded with bailouts. 
If you've watched the movie, you'll notice Mark Baum(Steve Eisman) admits that even he got the wall street guys wrong. He at first thinks they're fools who have no clue what's going to happen; it finally dawns on him that they weren't fools, they were careless because they knew government was going to save them at the taxpayers' expense. Keep in mind he sees the housing crash before it happens and is among the fistful of people in the world who do so.
Now, you might be okay with giving your hard-earned wealth to these scumbags but I'm not. 
For that reason, I'm all in on bitcoin.

I was of the same opinion months back. I believe in free markets (and consequently forks) but not in usurpation. Things like these make regulation look legitimate even though just typing that burned a hole in my stomach. 
You want to fork? Fork. Hey, even Litecoin's a fork and I love it. Heck even call it bitcoin cash if you want to. Just don't try to pass it off as bitcoin. It creates a shitty precedent and I for one cannot stand for it.

That's a whole other debate btc vs bch and the scaling issues. I am however hopeful about 2nd layer offerings - Raiden/LN - and think that they're an evolution... a next step that is inevitable but that has bearable trade-offs. Again, for those that don't like LN and aren't afraid of centralization as a result of big blocks, they can use alternatives and if governments make it impossible to use their alts without their authority and policies(which I think they most definitely will do), btc is always open and they can run back home and be accepted with open arms.

Not certain I agree with you 100%. That's how the problem begins because, so long as banks know that they'll always be bailed out, they won't care about being careful custodians of capital. I prefer a free markets approach where insurers and such take care of such downturns in the market. The banks themselves should promote their products based on how much insurance they've taken on them and customers should self-select into where they feel they're most comfortable. Or, just buy bitcoin.

Isn't this the most obnoxious thing I hear from crypto-detractors! The technology exists because of bitcoin and vice versa. The technology was created to escape the insanity created by these "experts", governments and central banks that are directly responsible for boom-bust cycles caused by their affinity for mal-investment. 
I'm not interested in blockchain without bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Blockchain exists to get rid of these malpractices in the fiat world.

I won't tell you what to do. I can however share how I made my first big purchase.
I'd been dabbling for a while with minimal purchases since late last year. The price was circa $700. I was waiting for some money to come through. During that period, BTC went from $700 to $5000. I bought at $5000 and then China happened. Price dipped to lows of $3500 but I swear I kept calm for two reasons:
- it wasn't ever going to be a perfect time to go in
- I put in money that I didn't care that much if I lost but if I gain, I gain big
Learn what you will from that and decide whether you want to hodl or trade. I'm not good at trading and I do also have a business I run so I just hodl.

There'll be a cash out just as much as there will be a cash out on gold. 
To me, bitcoin is almost like an intergenerational change of wealth. It is how people will hold the bulk of their wealth, only liquidating what is needed for other investment or day to day usage. There is no universal cash out point. That's not how I think of bitcoin and I'm sure many other people agree with me.
What does keeping your wealth in cash mean? Perpetual inflation and depletion of wealth. Bitcoin guarantees the opposite.
Before critiquing bitcoin in this way, always remember why and when it was created. They both matter. It was post 2008 financial crisis, meaning that even these other s%itty financial instruments crash and we on the outside can do nothing about it because we have very little control and insight as to what the hell is going on. With bitcoin, all that changes, we can inspect the actual code, we can see how the money is moving on a realtime basis etc. Such openness and transparency was unprecedented until bitcoin came along.

I always find it fascinating how all other schools apart from the Austrian school define inflation as some enigmatic way in which way the price of things magically rises as opposed to what the Austrian school proposes and what actually happens, which is; an increase in the supply of money in an economy, undertaken by central banks by authority of governments. It is theft. It is unethical. It leads to mal-investment and boom-bust cycles where you end up with the great depression or the 2008 financial crisis.
Bitcoin is the answer to this kind of theft.

Most first time users don't know the difference or anything to do with forks.

IT IS DISINGENUOUS and its creators could be more deliberate about making it clear that bitcoin cash IS NOT bitcoin.

Regardless of that, I think he should get some credit for promoting non-intervention by government on the issue of bitcoin and crypto in general. He will be won over on it being real money just as all detractors will be. We forget sometimes how hard it is for regular people to immediately wrap their brains around the concept of intangible coins whose inner workings are hardly understood by many. It takes getting used to.

Respectfully, it is however controversial that money supply is the problem in the long run. Most economists do try to complicate reality by bringing in components like velocity of money but in essence it comes down to a question of do you believe growth comes from actual productivity or it comes from consumption. You **appear** to subscribe to the latter. 
I also think what matters is who gets the money first once it is 'printed'. Just to show you how corrupt the current system is, **primarily**, bankers are the ones who get the money first and can buy cheap assets before the money trickles down into the rest of the economy i.e. before inflation kicks in. I consider this to be moral bankruptcy. 
The only time I would even begin to consider printing of money (and even then, I still don't think government should have anything to do with money supply or circulation) is if everyone's money could be diluted at the same time. But they of course don't want this. They want to steal from some and give to government/fed selected recipients (this is what leads to malinvestment because it is cheap/free money) in the name of stimulating the economy. 
Austrians have begun to realize that the only way to beat these guys is to start approaching it from an ethical standpoint and this is the case here; it simply isn't ethical to rob from people this way. 
My interest has recently been piqued by Japan's zombie corporations. Japan used to be an economic powerhouse on the rise but that has changed and it is specifically because of this type of behaviour by government and central bank. 
[Check out this link on the same] ( 


They're essentially punishing good actors (producers) by way of inflation and taxation to reward bad actors (failed businesses/banks) by way of tax cuts and undeserved cheap loans. This type of incentive structure is dangerous. 
Velocity of money is absolutely the wrong way to look at things. It is better to embrace reality and examine what the actual problem that is leading to lack of productivity is. Laissez-faire is the fair approach. It is the moral approach.

What's more important, as was the case with Cyprus, is the proliferation of the idea that currency alternatives exist and that bitcoin is the leader in that respect. 
For too long the idea that currency can only be fiat / govt affiliated / issued / regulated has prevailed. Any opportunity to communicate the perils of government involvement in currency issuance, inflation and regulation is welcome in my view. 
People are waking up to inflation and they're running to bitcoin to help them secure their hard earned money from greedy politicians and bankers as was exemplified in the 2008 financial crisis.
Bitcoin is deliberately deflationary and that should always be remembered.

Not everyone, but a lot more than has ever been in history. Message is going round. For the first time ever, people are starting to understand how money works and how government theft works. I have a whole theory on how this is some sort of intergenerational change of wealth but that's a story for another day.
A few months ago, inflation in my country hit 11%. This is atrocious; govt keeps printing money like it means nothing to all of a sudden lose 11% of your holdings' value. Venezuela has also been discussed rather increasingly as a perilous and cautionary tale as regards to what can happen to your country's currency. It is daylight robbery and thanks to the libertarian movement, this has increasingly been discussed on various media platforms. Bitcoin is here to save the day thank goodness. Excessive capital gains tax will now be the thing to worry about in the future. That's where they'll hit crypto hard. 
Again, it is theft because, it is known who gets the newly printed money first - bankers in bed with govt. If you get money first in such a setup before it trickles down to the economy, you get to buy assets at a cheaper rate if you decide to and sell at a later date for undeserved huge gains.

In fact, as BTC rises in value, expect less and less market volatility. A 10% dip at a value of $45,000+ is much much greater than a similar dip percentage-wise at $6K: $4500 vs $600. 
Less so at BTC price of $100K. And at around BTC $1M, for something to change btc price by even something like %0.1, it would really have to be a really impactful thing that is of real consequence even in markets other than BTC. This is where broader macroeconomic and geopolitical factors will truly be a consideration into the pricing of BTC not nonsensical events like Jamie Demon making a disparaging statement.

Risk and reward is the name of the game. It's always been incumbent on users to take personal responsibility of their private keys.

Maybe we should all take a step back and ask why we want a crypto in the first place: Is it because we don't want centralization, is it because we want what the original white paper stated - a P2P currency?


I'm not against any coin (bitcoin or alt). I'm simply for market determinism. Otherwise, when calls for things like regulatory involvement are made [see Samson Mow's tweet], it makes you wonder why not just stick with fiat? They've regulated it like hell and I would assume any legitimate bitcoiner is first and foremost against any form of regulation. Was bitcoin not a sort of statement against legacy banking and fiat currency that led to the great recession '08? 
The point here is to remember the basics of why we're even doing this in the first place. Anything that takes us back to oversight and control by government should be dismissed. Anything that advances separation of currency from government(or any central authority) should be welcome. I think competitiveness increases choice and choice is good.

Yes, and sellers are allowed choice as well. Not just consumers. It's their hardware, their private property. Are they to be imposed upon just because they're the sellers in this scenario? I think not. If you're right about the superiority of your product, you need not worry about competition, just market it and consumers or sellers in your marketplace will make a choice as to whether to participate. That is what capitalism is. Actors act with self-interest and an optimal outcome is attained. If they're wrong as sellers, and you are right about your assertions, then the market will punish them for making a wrong bet and they'll get in line.

100% true. The picture says it all. I've been saying the same thing about this whole private blockchain stuff being pushed by companies like IBM. Nonsense.

Exactly. Volatility will only be quelled when the market cap is so large that a few sellers won't have enough BTC net worth to dent the market if they sell/buy. In essence, the larger the market cap of a crypto, the less the volatility. My bet is that as soon as BTC is at around $500K+, all volatility that is not rooted in real events that truly matter (like a valid security threat) will cease to exist.

You may want to consider that may be 'biological food' &amp; 'organic fabbrics' aren't the best solutions. There is more that goes into making one solution better than the other. Taste and personal preference aren't the only things that consumers will consider when making a purchase that solves their needs in the best way. Other things such as cost come into play. I may prefer something but if by purchasing it I will sabotage my finances disallowing me to live a quality life tomorrow, then by all means, that product is not the best that the market has to offer.

She is so winning in life! These kids will know nothing but crypto; fiat will be so strange they'll ask us, 'Why did you do that to yourselves?' At least that's the hope.

Just HODL till &gt;$50,000
It may be cheap even then

Wow. Wow. Wow. My sympathies about the troubles that Venezuela has been facing lately. It is however encouraging the way crypto just swept in to salvage a situation brought about by a failure by government, fiat and 'social-democracy'. Sometimes I've felt like giving up on how messed up the whole system is but when I read about a real world scenario where power and control has been restored in the hands of the individual as is the case with you and bitcoin, the libertarian in me is reinvigorated.

Government irresponsibility and the common man's sudden realization of it.

I would direct you to some of Satoshi's writings as to the motive for which he invented bitcoin, more specifically point number 3:

Exactly. Insane government debt we all know will be written off at some point and essentially end life as we know it coupled with unending printing of fiat leading to inflation(theft). Fiat will end in the ugliest of ways. It sure won't be pretty.
