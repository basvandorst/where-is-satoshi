In what way am I a karma whore.  Been here for 4years,  rarely post links.  I couldn't care less about karma.
Secondly why is it a fail.  A site which horribly compromised the security of peoples money decides that when it comes back it will charge a subscription fee for the reasonable security they should have had in the first place.
I fail to see either if your points.

Yes.   In the future there may be so much compute that 50btc is not enough to make it worth while to mine.   As that happens and as the bounty goes down, miners will stop including transactions with 0 fee into their blocks.  The transaction fees will naturally settle to a comfortable place between what the customer is willing to pay and what the miners will accept.

No.  You dropped the "h" which is the measure of time.  It isn't 5.86KW but rather 5.86 Kilo-Watt-Hours.   So there 5.86 / 24 hours in a day ==  244.1 Watts to run the card.
Average houshold uses 10,656 kwh per year.  Which is 29.1 kwh per day.

Of course.  Point being that security should not be an upsell but inherent in the system.
Imagine if someone walked into your bank, said they were you and the bank gave them all your money and then proceeded to tell you there would be a $2.99 fee for the tellers check id of people asking for your money.
Just seems absurd to me.

WRONG.  Mining is key to the security of bitcoin.  Too few miner and one entity could gain control of &gt; 51% of the mining capacity.  If that happens they have the power to cause all sorts of havoc, not the least of which is forking the block chain.
An entity which controls a majority of the mining capacity gains the centralized control which bitcoin was created to prevent.
You are right that 200000000 T/hps vs 100G/hps doesn't much matter but diversity in mining is key.  If it dropped too low, someone with even temporary access to large computing power could fork the chain.

Ok.. going to try it out.  BUT doesn't look like there is anyone there to trade with.  We'll see how it goes.
@_date: 2011-06-26 00:09:08
Not all of them.  There are a bunch dumping bitcoin over at tradehill.

This.. Your card is not doing enough mh/Watt to make you cash.   The cards he mentioned probably use about the same electricity as yours but produces ~9x the hashes.
Also, the assumption is that as the difficulty increases, and the actual usage of bitcoin (not just mining) that much more will be made in fees than the 50btc produced in a block.
As I understand it, a mined block of btc is actually doing the work of verifying actual transactions.  In your bitcoin client you have the option of paying a small transaction fee to get it "Processed faster".   Well right now most miners will process any transaction because the money is being made on the 50btc/block found bonus.   When the difficulty is high enough to make this raw mining infeasible, most miners will stop accepting transactions with a 0 fee tied to them.  
At that point anyone who wants to actually have a transaction go through will have to attach a tiny fee to it.  These fees go to the miner or pool who finds the block.
But zeroquest is correct.  If you want to actually make any reasonable bitcoin right now, you should get as many ati cards as you can afford (see the chart he posted) as the difficulty just keeps going up.

I'd like to see native yubikey support as an optional second factor authentication.
@_date: 2011-07-14 17:42:14
Thanks.  I actually didn't intend to imply that you were being evil.   I just dont understand why I have to pay for another fox only ubikey.   Could you please consider supporting regular yubi keys in the future?  Sure it isn't quite as good as a private one but it is a HUge improvement over just a password.  That way those of us who already have one don't have to buy a second one?
@_date: 2011-07-14 03:57:00
Soooooo lame that gox requires you to buy a yubikey from them.   Agreed a custom yubikey that works with only their auth server is a tad more secure but this is the second factor.
Also providing standard yubikey support for those who already own one would still provide elevated security over password alone.  The only explanation is making money... grr.

Look in the sidebar of this reddit.  There is link to a list of hundreds of Marchand who take bitcoin.  He'll you can even pay for a hotel.

Why don't you READ.  ONLY people who had their trades rolled back will get it free.
@_date: 2011-07-31 06:40:22
Very nice.  Though you should make square ones and call them Block Chains.

Two factor authentication does not require a dongle.  Further I'm happy to buy a dongle but that is a one time fee, not a subscription.
@_date: 2011-06-23 19:43:55
Not to mention that I saw the 'free' part but that is only for those who had their trade rolled back.  Everyone else must pay so I deemed the free for some part as irrelevant.
@_date: 2011-06-21 09:05:53
Cool.   I have no problem using tradehills price.

My problem is that bitcoin is worth more that USD to me due to the pain-in-the-ass it is to get them.  Let me explain.  (btw I love them and do spend them)
A lot of people try to sell stuff for BTC equivalent of the USD of the product.   For example, lets say I want to buy an item that sells for $50 on amazon but I want to buy it from a merchant for BTC.
It is not worth paying $50 in BTC to me or even $45 because to get the BTC, I had to transfer $50 to dwolla or directly to an exchange (up to a week wait WTF!!)   And the buy the BTC.   Either that or mine it, also time intesive.
Perhaps I'm the only one who feels this way but I don't think the btc economy is going to take off if merchants keep expecting the USD equivalent payment at that days trading price.
Please tell me why I'm wrong because I really want to be wrong.

Not correct.   Trade hill states:  "$10USD on our end, your bank may charge as well."
It's $10 + your banks fee.

I'm going to tell you why I you are right but also why such laws are wrong.
I sold a mutual fund.  It happen to split the same day and due to a bank error, Citibank deposited 10s of thousands extra into my account which was not mine.   I contacted citibank who assured me all was in order and would not take the money back.   I persisted for several days with the same result.
After about two weeks, they magically took the money back. "Whew" I thought it was over.   No, it was just the beginning of my nightmare.  They reported the extra deposit to the IRS who proceeded to send me a massive tax bill for money I did not have and was never mine.
The IRS refused to even look at the paperwork unless citibank sent a correction.  Citibank does not allow you to talk to their "back office auditors" so I had to log the request with the idiot who answered the phone and wait about 6 weeks to get a written reply.   I spent 18 MONTHS trying to get citi to correct it, each time some faceless accountant would say, NOPE, all is correct.
At this point the IRS is taking action, my wages have been garnished (huge embarrassment at work), my wifes savings account had been siezed etc, etc, etc.
Eventually I was able to show hardship and was assigned an IRS "Taxpayer advocate" (basically an IRS employee paid to be on my side).  After about 20min of actually looking at the paperwork, she saw that not only was the money not mine but the bank had taken it back.  It was finally resolved.
So this is why such laws are bullshit.  If a bank, exchange or what not fucks up and sends people money incorrectly, the law happily allows them to fuck-up the life of the person they sent it to, even if they give it back.  The onus should be on the bank to be responsible for their own errors.   I realize the merits of the law but I am biased.   If you give away your money to someone, too damn bad.
EDIT: BTW I do not think I should have been able to keep that money.  Just pisses me off that I tried for days to give it back and they wouldn't take it.. Then they fucked me bad.
@_date: 2011-06-23 10:23:30
Yes I did.
Can you tell me more about the yubikey and how it can be used for different passwords for each system?   It seems to either need special software or in legacy mode can just type a single static password as a keyboard.
How do you plan to use it?  
@_date: 2011-06-23 04:55:40
One correction it is not the longest chain but the one with the highest total difficulty.

While the theories may hold true.  Mtgox did post that if you get rejected, they just need more info to make sure it is you.  They suggest reapplying with some more info such as account numbers, dates and amounts of money you have transferred in or out.
I find that it is possible they are holding a high standard of proof so someone who hacked your account can't just claim to be you.  Have you submitted info like tito13kfm mentioned in his post?
