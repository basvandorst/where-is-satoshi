Why not stockpile ready for when the currency regains strength?

The tweet says "never have one" so it's wrong, the 20m cities could.

A speculative investment, for me. I'm not a crypto expert but I am somewhat informed when it comes to economics.

What code? You mean password?

Btc supply is fixed. It can be hoarded by whales. It cannot replace the dollar as new supply is needed to enable economic growth, businesses to expand and invest, people to take out a mortgage etc..

My feels when I'm paying loads of buying, exchanging and withdrawal fees on all the crypto exchanges....

You cannot fix the supply of money. What if Jim wants to start a new company, but Bill does too and Bill already borrowed the available money. How would Jim start a business? That's why banks create new money. Economy wouldnt grow without it. 
YouTube video "money as debt" is worth watching.

I guess u could argue they're specifically encouraging people to exchange their bitcoin, assuming they don't have similar such ads for selling other cryptos. Although others could argue its only because bitcoin is the main crypto

You sound confident in btc

Exchanging one crypto for another, or moving it to another wallet, also involves a fee

Did the 2014-15 pattern follow that of the bull run before that? If not, then history suggests history doesn't repeat itself.. ��

Aren't there 21m btc? 
@_date: 2019-03-12 21:08:13
I can't, but maybe explaining why would help you.

Is there a big "convert your litecoin" on the home page, too? (I'm assuming this post is of a main page and not the bitcoin page?) 
@_date: 2019-03-20 23:17:47
That's what I told the misses 
@_date: 2019-09-20 20:11:03
Yes. Yes it is.
