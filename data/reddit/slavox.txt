Just going to add fuel to the conspiracy fire here but if you stole the coins and wanted to cast doubt on mtgox, Use the code (which is public) and pretend to be them.
When Mtgox denies it's them - We all start a hunt after gox because of it being "their code" ?!!?
I hate conspiracy shit, it's most likely just some coins they did have access to that they're setting up for some reason

you don't have to be a redditor for more than 4 minutes to know Japanese and be willing to help...
@_date: 2014-03-03 05:09:26
In this case though anyone could write anything regardless old account or new and none would be the wiser until someone confirms/denies their translation...
As a requirement for trust it doesn't really change the fact that none of us can speak Japanese

Why move them though? He has the private keys so all he has to do is remove them from the gox databases and can move them whenever.
Why send them through the 'gox code' to split if they're all going to him? 200,000 A -&gt; B = Complete

The HODL meme kinda embodies the opposite of what the pizza purchase stands for.
Today should be our black friday. Spending our coins and making it rain on all the vendors who are willing to accept bitcoin.
Spending and using the blockchain is what gives it value.
With the meteoric rise that the HODL crew are on as much as they would like to believe they hold the market up by not selling in reality it isn't them alone. It's people spending and working with bitcoin that gives it this insane price.

Maybe he is blinking out the private key for us to use to extract our coins

Can confirm this gave my correct balances :/

I think the most likely theory is that these coins were not stolen and POSSIBLY marks personal coins - If you're robbing a bank and you miss a couple of gold bars hidden in the corner you're still well off
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:28:26
ahh if the api reports it it's probably just gox...nothing to see here

I agree the speculation should go elsewhere but it impossible to enforce that on a community of this size.
So I figure if this lets a few people rest their hate for awhile
@_date: 2014-03-14 04:48:59
You are correct! All except mtgox

keeps having his post deleted so I am reposting it to see if it is just him:
The post has been undeleted:
**Last attempt to share my conversation as it seems that my comment keeps getting deleted. Cheers**
 
**FINAL UPDATE: Almost full conversation (the japanese Google Translate part didn't get record unfortunately):  - Please excuse the french accent and thank you MtGox!**
 
**My initial reply was deleted, but I managed to get a hold of someone in english. Currently editing the audio to filter out my name.**
 
I like the second song. 9/10. Will live update with more impression.
 
*UPDATE:* The song n°4 is good as well. 8/10. How many more did they plan?
 
*UPDATE:* The song n°6 is very bad. A mix of sauna/8 bits song sped up. 2/10.
 
*UPDATE:* The song n°7 is a minimalist piano song with an 1/2 beat on the background. Catchy. 6/10
 
*UPDATE:* Back to the beginning. After listening to an 19 minute playlist elevator music, I feel relaxed and appeased. Thank you MtGox. I will keep providing live updates.
 
*UPDATE:* A live stream of this wonderful playlist -  Enjoy guys!
 
*UPDATE:* The first song sounds even better the second time you hear it. The saxophone solo always gets to me. 8.5/10
 
*UPDATE:* More information regarding the second song, reminds me of old Soviet Russia park music. 9 to 9.5/10!
 
*UPDATE:* Missed the update on the third song. Skype's lag speed it up giving it a very nice random effect. The songs live and evolve with you! A bit too simple for my taste though, 4/10.
 
*UPDATE:* The complete list (of the 4 first songs, you can complete the playlist with the link above):  - Enjoy!
 
*UPDATE:* The soothing sentiment is disappearing as song n°6 started. Reduced to 2/10.
 
*UPDATE:* In the eventuality the operators do not speak english, I will be using Google Translate voice bot to talk directly to the operator in japanese.
 
*UPDATE:* Despite having prepared  and  and using the bot, a very nice lady replied to my call in english. Some personal information were shared so bear with me while I filter my name out.

I believe the posts have a place on as it has been a major part of bitcoin 
There are likely many people here who never used gox but still read the articles
You will never win downvoting gox posts due to the amount of interest and unless it gets banned here will not catch all of the articles
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:55:46
The balances have not been zeroed - Though unlikely it is still possible gox customers will get some coins returned

This is not @_date: 2015-05-29 08:50:24
IS that actually done though? My understanding is it WAS the sole source for the wallet generation 
I don't see how that would have created the duplicate wallets in the first place?

Dear MtGox Customers,
In the event of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on MtGox's operations and the market, a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users. We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly.
Best regards,
MtGox Team

Sure we can all believe in the end goal of bitcoin but how do you want to get there?
I'd argue that if we continue allowing untrustworthy people to motivate and move us forward we only risk taking longer to reach that end game due to subsequent crashes, scandals and bad press.
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:32:49
Where do you people come from? 
Anyone who looks at his history can see he is slippery. 
Yes he made megaupload, mega and now works on bitcache.
But we must not forget his history and the position he is currently in with legal and financial troubles he may simply be using this as an easy way to make some money and run.


With this example in mind does it not seem plausible that he may be wishing to exploit the unregulated nature of bitcoin and pull in investments and pump the price for his own gain?

The distribution amounts and how it will be handled is currently undecided.
The next creditors meeting is in September which is when we will likely hear more details about the future.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:30:04
I think that's where people are missing the point. He locked in the exact amount required to repay the creditors.
There is no longer a need to sell Bitcoins to pay off creditors so a decision for distribution can be made for the remainder but the important part is that he has secured the yen required to pay back all of the claims. Its a lot better than getting nothing or the mentioned 20% (estimated based on number of btc vs the amount claimed)

Hi Mark,
First off I'm glad you survived all the personal attacks and managed to stay sane and relatively active on reddit and IRC despite all the memes and hatred.
I have had a few questions on my mind for years some of which you may be able to answer here.
1. Who wrote/managed the "Willy bot" &amp; what was it's intended purpose? 
2. Pior to the closing of withdraws at Mt Gox at what point were you aware that the BTC had gone missing? 
3. Chain analysis seems to show that the hacker/hackers were stealing coins for years prior to the final bankruptcy. 
Are you aware of any reason why they simply didn't empty the wallets completely? 
4. Are there other company shareholders who also have claim to this extra BTC? Do they share your opinon that it is the creditors who deserve it?
Despite what people may think Mt Gox helped build and shape this community. It showed people bitcoin had real value when it was just some cool tech. We learnt from Gox and the community is stronger because of it.
Thank you

Payment processors like bitpay actually do a guaranteed conversion as far as I'm aware, you get your USD deposit relative to the price when the product was purchased regardless of changes in the market 
(How much they can cover in situations where it crashes like this is unproven)
@_date: 2013-05-07 06:04:58
For those of you who thought this was a scam - 
I have just received the unit today (Payment was made on 03/05) So 3 working days and they made an order with a supplier in my country and it arrived today :)
Pics: 
To those who are going to STILL say it could be a scam - What more could anyone be asked to prove? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:26:48
also possibly misleading as it's close to bittraders, btctrade etc. I'm not very good with names
@_date: 2013-12-21 12:41:33
I think the eventual aim is that the transaction fees will be enough to sustain the miners
So more transactions = more fees = more supply = more moon

I just had the same call same reasoning given, there are other ways to fund sadly international wire was the easiest 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:19:19
Fair point, But is that really all bitcoin is about? I don't think that's all there is to it, it's easy to forget bitcoin actually has practical uses more than just investment 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:18:15
Closing of trading is a very very weird circumstance what do speculators do when they can't actively control their speculation? They get scared because they know it could and would drop, it's somewhat worrying that mtgox just halts trading without a real explanation as to what they are doing..
That all said everyone should have diverse trading for security reasons
