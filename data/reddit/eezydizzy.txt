ahametals.com leeches off of other sites by copying their articles. It would be better if you posted links to the original articles rather than to your own site, so that the original site gets the traffic.

So, you think it is temporary situation that withdrawals suspended? Why do you think they do it?? What's the point?

Who's going to take? The bank are just talking to much - while the laws about bitcoin are aren't clear, they won't use it widely.

I didn't know that mining cost right now is roughly $44 per transaction!

This is an encouraging statement from the UK government. Bitcoin may be regulated in the uk soon, but is not illegal. I am surprised to see the C of E showing high profile support for bitcoin.

You can't coordenate such big group. Otherwise there would not be any bubble in any market.
And even if you could, then outside people would see it as big market manipulation, since if you can agree to stay at the 1500's, then you can agree to put it back to the 500's and then rise to the 1500's, making a huge profit in the meanwhile.

Coinbase... not coindesk....
Both will coexist as centralized exchanges have venture capital investments and profits to allow them to hire more developers for different features and products and decentralized exchanges will be used by others for security.

i wouldn't be surprised if they talk about it.. it's made tim draper almost a public figure, at least with us people.

I love bitcoin and I use bitcoin everyday but I don't think Bitcoin will replace fiat. Bitcoin will replace with today payment system. We will use bitcoin like using e-mail and internet.

Now that story sound awesome. It's a short story, right? I would definitely read it if I could. Any ETA for the release?

I still haven't seen any details about any wide public release as of yet.   Seriously by the time it is available for the general public, the material is going to be so old...  They probably could have made some good money off of this documentary by releasing it online for $10 through vimeo or something like that

I don't know much about 2011, but in 2010 it was extremely easy to buy Bitcoins. Because the most important exchange at that time (New Liberty Standard) accepted both Paypal and CC (Visa / Master). And you won't believe the exchange rates. It was 1$ = BTC1,309.03.

Bitcoin is not ready for mainstream yet. It is common that emerging technologies are adopted by entrepreneurs and so-called "geeks" first. These are the ones that provide the necessary tools and features that the mainstream needs to join the new technology.
There is no need to worry. We are simply in the earliest stages of adoption.

That's a great idea!

Tim is a smart guy; I've liked him for a couple years. I'm looking forward to when he can speak confidently and knowledgeably on the topic.

I would probably change the fees so that even smaller amounts can be sent without large fees. If bitcoin gets more expensive, you could have to pay several dollars to send one dollar of bitcoin.

Altcoins traditionally fail when some several subsidity reductions occured (coins with shorter lifecycle out there)
A coin cannot exists on transaction fees. Those are merely a security against blockchain spam attacks.
So when mining becomes impossible due to subsidy reduction, and transaction fees cannot compete with altcoins out there, Bitcoin will simply extinct.

Good question! But no one is able to look into the future, as there are a lot of speculators it will grow and fall again and again, but the trend will be positive.

I do believe that "high frequency" or "shortwave" radio, which is what you mean, will play a role in human liberty.

I'd be glad to give you Paypal for your coins with just a 3% exchange fee.  Check my thread over here.  Or you can just go with the strategy that has never failed and HODL
