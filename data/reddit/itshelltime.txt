To give your palm scans, passport, and photo ID's to a stranger you've never met and know nothing about?

wow there have been a lot of attempts to compare writing styles to Satoshi's and I've never seen much merit in them but vinced is convincing.  nobody will ever know.

I never trusted Robocoin's creators from day one. They're dbags
@_date: 2014-10-10 23:39:59
yeah they are creepy...banks follow KYC/AML procedures but no bank requires a palm scan to open an account.  Theres a hidden agenda in my opinion
@_date: 2014-08-12 21:47:23
I think the bot's presence adds a nice touch

Bitcoin is about revolution not about making your lazy, greed driven ass rich.

Bitcoin isnt for you.  
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:41:38
Hey look!  Those guys are FIAT traders and they post the same comments as bitcoiners when scams occur.  And yet buttcoiners would have you believe differently.  Tell me again about how bitcoin users are out of touch with the reality of markets?

Where is the "rule of law" to protect me from opaque secret courts, a private central bank, the patriot act, etc?  I suppose the liberal solution would be to start a peaceful protest, join hands and sing cumbaya my lord until those big mean leaders give in...thats been working reaaall well lately, huh?  Also read: First Amendment.  But that shouldn't be allowed when it threatens the established power amitrite?
@_date: 2014-12-25 23:16:02
Lol yep since I'm a smart investor and only buy what I'm willing to lose I'm not a "true believer".  WSJ is toilet paper.

Yep right after they repeal the Patriot Act and end mass surveilance

Meh he's an irrelevant old bag of bones....I really don't care how much money he made manipulating mega industries like coca cola, he's an uncreative, money grubbing weasel.  His whole life has had no point but to make his own family wealthy pushing garbage like cocacola onto the peasantry. Wow such genius, the hell with having artists, musicians, inventors, scientists, etc as mentors, I'm going to spend my life grubbing over finance...what a rock star.  
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:12:20
The entire "gateway" system is crap.  In addition to fees,  your USD are IMMEDIATELY devalued the second it hits the ripple network because all the gateways are shady and nobody wants to place trust in them.  
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:00:06
Yep you definitely have the condescending tone of a pretentious programmer.  And a statist to boot! 
@_date: 2014-08-16 00:41:20
Lol I've never heard the term crypto-capitalist before.  the author seems to think that crypto-anarchy="anarchy on the internet" but its closer to crypto=hidden and anarchy=no ruler/authority/etc/lookitup. fundamental natural law such as the mathematics employed in cryptographic technology could become the "rulers" but by our modern measurements of government and authority seem hidden and abstract.
  I fail to see what makes investors "hidden"...they are capitalists who happen to be investing in crypto
@_date: 2014-08-21 23:55:22
Sounds like more weasel talk to me
@_date: 2014-12-25 23:12:36
Pretty cool!  Just as long as its not his "savings" address but if hes been onboard since pre $100's I'm sure he knows the ropes :)
@_date: 2014-12-25 21:41:14
Crypto-Anarchy isn't as anti - establishment as it sounds. Nobody ever said bitcoin was anonimoose, it's about putting natural laws (ie: mathematical proofs of concept) above an arbitrary man-made system.  It will absorb governments, not overthrow them.  The strong will always dominate the weak regardless of arbitrary political theories like communism because natural law doesn't give a fuck about man-made fantasy.  TLDR; anything can happen, gov will adapt as needed to changing paradigm.

I am entitled to use the services I deem highest quality and best value.  If one exchange fails on this I simply take my entitled ass somewhere else.  I'll throw coinbase,circle,Bitstamp,etc under the bus the second something better comes along.  Welcome to survival of the fittest.

It must be terrible to hate bitcoin but feel the overwhelming urge to constantly comment on it.  My condolences

Whats not to understand? This sub is riddled with subservient statists who only care about bitcoin because moon money.

SO I am supposed to believe that Satoshi, creator of a "decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system", would leave incriminating personal information on a centralized server that he no longer even uses? Hmmm.  Lets not forget that yesterday this troll got called out for his luke-warm attempts at humor before suddenly "identifying Satoshi"...I highly doubt he has anything of value, but I suppose I'll have to sit back and watch. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:43:21

You can either believe in some shadowy, elusive force like the morons on do, or you can realize that markets fluctuate in price based on investor interest (like real investors do.)  The price is crashing because all of the investors think its crashing.
@_date: 2014-12-31 16:26:49
Everybody be scewin statistics for their own ends.  Buttcoin ignore the 5 years of amazing growth and this sub ignores the fact that resistance is so high at $1100ish that it will take years to move past the bagholder's wall (if ever).
