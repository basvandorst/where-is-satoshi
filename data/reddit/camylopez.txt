Regulations allows them to not hide the reason they are closing accounts.
Have a look at all the australian forex companies and money remiters that get the same treatment for the last few years, and they are regulated.

this is what regulations bring you guys, they can now start to be open about banning crypto.
well done for those that thought regulations would protect them

dude, there are plenty of good traders if you want to sell your coins.
just read the profile of the person you will trade with.
if they have over 3k trades and no negs, your probably in good hands.
someone with an old account and recently changed email with reversible methods and trading in multiple countries, huge red flags.
use your common sense

hahaha, that vid is so totally fake (am an aussie here )
@_date: 2017-02-19 06:45:19
its def aussie, but thats a fake redback/brown snake.
redbacks are smaller than 1cm in length, and they run away.
i been bitten by them, they arent deadly (it looks like a redback spider, but way oversized)
brown snakes are much bigger and i havent seen one with a head like that, and brown snakes are strong and aggressive, no way it would be docile like that.
a fake aussie sense of humor to fool overseas guys :)

how work the goats?

did you read, or you have a comprehension issue? there is a 30 day wait, which is not stealing. 
paypal takes 60 months holds on funds, if they deem it suspicious, and a trader is very well within his right to make his terms.
if the buyer doesnt like it, they should shop elsewhere, or man up and fulfill the requirements.

i dont confuse you with the op, my questions were rhetorical. 
a fool and his money are easily parted, I think we can see who is the real fool in all this. 
you can trade plenty, and still have no idea how the scams work, and your replies to this thread show how inexperienced you are. 
I will spell it out very simply for you.
opp posted on reddit as he was counting on reddit supporters such as yourself, he dont want experienced traders discussing this.
had he posted this on the lbc forum, he would have been made by many experienced traders who are up to date on how these scams work. If he was legit he would have posted on the lbc forum

pshawman isnt GG
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:09:45
It probably isnt even his own money.
You would send someone money, then refuse to fulfill requirements?
On top of that you would cancel the trade?
On top of that you would then refuse to call the police?
Dude, go start trading then maybe you will know what your talking about. 
If your offered 30 days and funds returned, why would you voluntarily cancel that?
Then GG gives money back to a nobody with no proofs, and finds it was stolen?
Traders are there to make business, they dont make it harder than they have to to do their business, what makes it hard is the scammers and fuckwits that try to screw traders over and exploit loopholes.
We have many awesome legit customers, but we also have the filth and thieving scum, and we have to make our own minds up who is who. 
Customers can help us, or they get relegated to scammer.
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:22:05
maybe like me he can communicate with GG.
look my username im also a trader on lbc, we using our real names so nothing to hide
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:33:48
what can I say, its a service industry, and we are at ppls call almost 20 hours a day.
very hard to do the volumes and give 100%, 100% of the time, especially with problem customers who disappear and come back at weird times and expect immediate attention.
I have not many other commitments, but thats not everyone. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:38:01
he isnt my friend ive never met him,  he is my competitor, if anything business would be bigger if he werent there, so there is zero interest why competitors supporting each other. 
Except for people trying to screw us over. 
So your dad relies on medicine to stay alive, and you dont take care on the receipts?  come on, Ive had that excuse used on me as well before, and if my dads life was on the line, i would be taking more care. 
you should try trading yourself, or maybe just go and look at the scammed bankrupt traders. There are more of them than actual traders still in business.

Greenglobal asked if you can post the original and unedited conversation from LBC. On here thanks. For all the world to see....

seems to be very common for people to refuse to believe this is happening, even people who are already familiar with and buy btc.
westpac was all for it one stage, but they are one the worst now
