You went through my account history? Haha that is just beyond pathetic. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:38:41
And who do they sell it to?

Absolutely nothing bullish about it. No matter how many times you tell yourself that. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:40:47
Did you downvote me?
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:27:53
I've been seeing all kind of predictions for years now. Why does that crap keep being posted here? His predictions mean as much as my 10 year old newphew saying 10 or 100.000 by 2018. 
People seriously are downvoting me for not agreeing with me? Seriously?
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:42:57
You don't make any sense. Sorry. 
Amazing how you can't have any discussion here without being downvoted. I sure hope the people doing that are not older than 15. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 13:01:22
So what's the point again of open bazaar?
I love how i'm downvoted for asking a question. Not allowed here i guess. Just do as you're told and don't question anything or you will be silenced!

Coming from someone who goes through someone's history when being told something he doesn't like on a public forum. 
No seriously, it's pathetic and sad as hell. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 16:08:48
But post it here and upvote it to the top when MSM says something positive about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 06:09:57
Been hearing that for 3 years now. 
When exactly will this happen and how do you know?
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:09:20
That's insane. Why is this post completely ignored? Sounds like a good subject to discuss. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 05:00:28
Not sure what's more annoying. The spam or this question getting asked every 30 minutes. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:18:27
Amazing. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 02:43:01
Yes. For instance the 50 people before you who posted the exact same thing. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 09:33:15
You're an internet tough guy like that. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 06:18:20
Yes. Everyone is getting them and you're the 50th person to start a thread about it.

What tsunami?
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:33:23
I was talking about your money when you send it there. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:35:21
Of course not. Why would a financial genius like you and future millionaire do so.  
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:52:57
How do you know?
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:18:21
Aaaaand it's gone!
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:29:20
Surprising. Next thing you're telling me you own bitcoins and think a financial crisis will make you rich. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:37:48
How high were you when you typed this?
@_date: 2016-01-27 22:02:01
Get ready for "Should've used (x) instead". Where x will be the next company to screw you over. You will then be told you're and idiot for using them and should've used (y) instead. 
The only way to not lose your coins is by not using them...ever.
