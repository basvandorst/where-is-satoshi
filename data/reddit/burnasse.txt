Is this really the only problem ? I mean okay Bitcoin is efficient. 
Bitcoin will be efficient even if transactions are slower and you know why ? Because banking system already take few fucking days, that's a shame.
Bitcoin has not been created to be efficient, if you want something efficient you give the control of the entire world supply of money to a single bank, you can't do anything faster to validate the transactions. Is this what we want ?
Bitcoin payments might take few hours, who cares ? Speed has never been the main argument of Bitcoin and will never be (because it can't). 
And again, it's just a matter of time before china modernize its internet and it becomes a non-problem too, like the hard drives. Just be patient.

SG is Société générale yes, not société générale express bank. I didn't know they had an eastern european "version" of SG. I guess things are not good there too...

I agree with you so much... I mean, do the guys against 1MB size realize that the global crash of economy could occur at any day ? What will happen if bitcoin is not ready ?

Well, it probably depends of your agency I don't know... These guys are a real pain in the ass for real. And Kraken.com is considered as a fraudulent website for them.
