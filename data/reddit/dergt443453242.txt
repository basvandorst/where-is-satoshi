could be wrong, but doesn't this really just show the slow steady decline of the market cap over the last few months?

liqpay works.. it's just hard to get your CC verified and the first few times you use it your bank is likely to block the transactionns for 'fraud' - you call up and tell them you really did mean to send money to the ukraine and do it again. Once it's all setup though it works pretty well and is a way to buy btc instantly with a credit card and relatively low fees. If you have a non-USD credit card remember you'll end up paying ~3% credit card foreign exchange fees as well though.

you can use interkassa (instant) or ask btc-e support for a deposit number ( i think this is still manually processed so takes a bit longer) and deposit directly. afaik there are no limits on how much money can be deposited, however I've noticed that large transactions have a greater tendency to be declined by my bank.

the tricky part about registering your card with liqpay is that they will authorize a small test transaction - that never gets billed. somehow you need to get your bank/cc to tell you how much was authorized (probably calling customer services) - it will never show on your statement. It will reduce your available credit temporarily (until the end of the month i think - then it disappears), so you could possibly check your available credit before/after and see the difference.. then enter the amount as 3 digits (without the decimal) on the liqpay CC verification page. Also remember that you need the amount in USD - not whatever other local currency your card might be using.

I think it's just a typo.. should have said 1 to 3 Kenyans and 1 to 9 Tanzanians have a bitcoin wallet :p

They're one of the oldest and most reliable exchanges and afaik have never ripped anyone off - however they operate anonymously so there's no guarantee that they won't just disappear one day.. if that were to happen I'd say your chances of redress through legal means would be roughly 0. Their 'bank account' isn't theirs.. it belongs to a prepaid debit card and other financial service provider.. I don't know what arrangement they have with them, but if things went badly I'm sure it would turn out to be not their (or anyone else you could identify's) fault ;)
