Can we stop saying we are **investing** and say we are **supporting** instead?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:15:28
Thanks I am fine. I am just preparing for the next financial crisis. Cryptocurrencies have been very good to me and save my a** a lot of time. So I try to not focus much on the money but on the community and the tech.
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:54:07
Just read [this one]( There are a lot of approximations! This is not a thorough piece :-(
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:06:14
for example various parameters (difficulty, throughput, block size...). 
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:26:48
I would say: let's define successful first. You have a range of protocols but no one agrees on the security guarantees.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:28:21
Aren't we supposed to go the **S** curve? 
Investing, nowadays, is not supporting when most of the people only look at the chart, don't have the slightest idea about how blockchain really works, look at the devs like their employees, ....

He is smarter than most of the people in the space. He literally gave the key: **don't invest in something you do not understand**. I don't put a cent on coins I don't understand. I actually don't think I am investing but supporting the coins I like or find useful.
It's about time people start to look at other things than the money!

I feel like Hayek would like cryptocurrencies.

Well that will make people understand that it is a long term thing and look at what the tech can bring to their life in the mean time. 
So yeah, today it's red, I lost a *hypothetic* value of my money. So what? I am not a trader, I am not an investor. I am in Bitcoin (and the whole space) for more, way more than just +/-XX%.

I do not see why they would award an economic price to Satoshi.  I mean, seeing the type of laureates and subjects, he chances are insanely low:
@_date: 2019-07-21 10:24:43
I think you forgot to compare the security: what are they based on, do they have some sort of certifications or can we rely on some audits, etc. Those are special purposes devices for this reason.
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:44:15
That's because it was a soft fork. People are supposed to decide what they want to choose. We can't make the upgrade *opt-in* and complain people don't use it more. 
I guess more education is needed.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:52:26
Yes and in it you have the code for the POW that just got attacked. This means you have 2 choices:
a) you keep the same POW algorithm. But the attacker has 51% so you get attacked again.
b) you change the POW. But this means all the miners have to change for CPU/GPU or have to build/buy new asics overnight.
So no we cannot "just" create a new one.
@_date: 2019-07-18 08:59:08
I didn't like the definition of "shitcoin" though.

More scary than the fact that miners are in some countries would be the capability for some countries to create mining power at scale. For instance it should take less resources for China to build more hashrate than we currently have.

Now the question is: how do you make people use it when it can double tomorrow?  The incentives are too high to keep it instead of spending.

I agree those are big numbers but we are in an adversarial environment and it is part of the game to look for the maximum ROI. We have to take in account different scenarios. It could be a state that want to destroy Bitcoin. Or actors who are already in the game like Bitmain who didn't want Segwit to happen on Bitcoin. Or Binance who was debating if they should fork because of the hack.

If your point is to kill Bitcoin , you can just mine empty blocks and frustrated the whole network.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:05:24
Yes it is a lot of money and I don't know how much it should be. Wasted money? Maybe not. It depends on your goal. You could mine , get reward and ROI then screw the network. But we cannot just "create a new Bitcoin the next day".
@_date: 2019-07-30 08:32:33
Of course this make sense as an answer. I don't think of Bitcoin as an investment. I think of it as an entry point to an ecosystem and the value going means I can do more things with it.

I am not optimistic as how cryptocurrencies would answer to war with a country/company/... There are too many attacks points and too little defence, IMHO.

This might be what you are looking for... or not ;-):
and r/Buttcoin if can stand their humour.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:38:18
it depends which attack is discovered:
* If it's about bruteforcing the entire space of keys in a practical way, then you just wiped *ALL* wallets.
* If it's about breaking your public key and assuming it's very practical, I can still try to break your key and submit a transaction with a higher fee etc. 
I don't know which one is worst, hash attacks or elliptic curve crypto attack. Anyway we won't be the only *application* to suffer
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:02:32
Also I am tired a people forgetting that what you pay for is the security of the platform. The value of this system is its usage (i.e. more than just *ponzi-ly* recruiting more newcomers and new  cash): the more usage, the more security.

ahah busted! I was pretty happy when I thought about this. It was supposed a easiest hack with a high reward. But it didn't work and I thought I didn't understand the solution. Well I will look around if any miner accepts it in their broadcast service. There is still a risk that they will keep it for themselves.

@_date: 2019-07-02 09:36:48
I asked that during my PhD interviews... still pad in fiat :-(
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:12:07
A good deal of websites like banks for instance are only secure by TLS. Same for emails (I tried Yahoo, Gmail) or Facebook. As much as I love cryptocurrencies but there are not the most ubiquitous use of cryptography. But this might be the *easier* way to make money once you have an practical attack. Maybe I should work on that instead :-D

So the cool way to do it:
* find a piggybank that you can *assemble* (to not trust the person who put the private key inside)
* put the private key in. For instance you could glue it. It is better than drawing it and scattering it when you open the poor piggy.

Story of my life.I think what is frustrating is that even if you are speaking only about the fiat value of the whole cryptospace, I tell them that I know a wide range of ways to earn crypto. Most of the coins I ever own I earn them and did not buy them. I did through bug bounties, coding, writing etc. 
I tell them it is an ecosystem that give you more capabilities than before.

@_date: 2019-03-01 10:31:45
We don't know what is the level of control they will have. It should prop questions that they are talking to exchanges, unlike JP Morgan.
All in all, I am really curious about they long term vision and why do they need a blockchain at all.

I am going to say that, realistically, they can all pretty much do that. Bitcoin won't your a\*\* for everything.
@_date: 2019-03-25 12:54:18
I really admire the people who do work on bitcoin code. Unfortunately, I feel like I cannot contribute hence why I don't even try to learn. Why? Because
1* the task is technically very complex
2* the process from idea to implementation and usage is very long/hard
3* too much drama because of the interests, the money, the users, the other blockchains...
I could survive in  the space if it is only about &amp; and 2. But personally, I found 3 very scary. I feel like I am always on the verge of annoying someone or being attacked. So yeah I think the people on the front-line are very brave.

Anyway, if I may, latest studies found out that the propagation time might be the real bottleneck and not the parameters like block time and block size. I don't know any study on bch propagation so it might be worth to look at to have a proper comparison between the two.

It would seem like your late husband did the security part of it right but forgot to explain you how to get the money back. 
From what I gather, he used the exchanges, what you called online wallets, just to buy and then transfer the coins out. One quick way to find out if there is money is to look at the withdraw history (all exchanges have that). Then you will know which cryptocurrencies he bought and the addresses.  You can quickly check on explorers ( just google "coin" explorer, like "bitcoin explorer").
Remember, there is no rush If you can deal with the funeral and stuffs using "normal" money. People have been giving you pretty good advices.

maximalism, shitcoin, nocoiner, centralisation, decentralisation, average user...
The list goes on. There is no definition of those terms and they are just used to criticize, generally not in a constructive way. 
I found that very sad. I thought the goal was to change the world...
@_date: 2019-08-22 20:37:17
I  have the same story with my folks. My dad is a former banker so it was easy and hard at the same time. So I thik he got the potential of Bitcoin but had doubt about regulations, rightly so. He felt that regulators could (but not \*should\*) ban it so he got that no one controls it. It was also hard because I had no practical application beyond topping up mobile airtime and hedging against national currency. 
I manage to convince to use it as an hedge so I can say that my mission was a success.
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:56:18
What was the last thing that excited me about Bitcoin? Hmm the 10 year anniversary or the whole activity on lightning and on cryptography.

I think it cost extra, at least in my bank :-(

It seems like you think that Schnorr should be added first but that BLS will come later on. 
I have to admit that I found the aggregation part really exciting. I am currently working on blockchains comparison and hope at some point to compare Bitcoin+Schnorr vs Bitcoin+BLS.
I have not thought of  using both. I don't really see why we would do that and as you say what do you recommend to the users. This is clearly those times when having too many options is bad. 
Btw I thought you would need a hard fork because BLS uses different elliptic curves.
@_date: 2019-08-19 08:37:42
seriously? you mean from the same bank? 
because it transfer generally take 1 day. I saw I could pay more to send an "instant transfer" but it is not worth it.

I will give it a look. thanks.

Everything is slowing going into place. I feel like like what we have been envisioning for some year is very very close to happen. Not moons, lambos and bull. More like a insane general awareness of Bitcoin and more people asking the question: why not?

I think we need to wait for 5 more years to really compare the different coins. The whole ecosystem really boomed like what 5 years ago, right? Then we can judge on achievement and not promises. At this point, it is not even worth looking too much at it. Most people (mainstream) can give more name than Bitcoin. Maybe Ethereum with the whole ICO but I doubt it. I am actually fairly sure Libra would come more often in the list than most coins out there.
So yeah, let's look at this in 5 years! As a space I would bet the top 3 or 5 would be fairly close, unlike today. But my bet for  would be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-18 12:11:33

what matters is not how much you pay on a certain date but whether you can transact cheaply the day you need it. I on my end find exchanges fees very high so I don't withdraw or deposit that often.

I do feel like I need to be *careful* in the way I comment. I do wish discussion were much more open but I do understand that people got tired of arguing. I really do.

@_date: 2019-08-28 11:34:45
That is so dumb. Seriously! The best plan was to let more and more competition because it will bring bigger adoption. Then, when there is a lot more consumers, you can slow down the competition. I mean we are way too early for that.

My on experience: to this day, I don't have many people to speak with about cryptocurrency. Some people are interested in some part of it. Some friends and family put money through me but I cannot speak about everything. This is a reason I changed work to be in the blockchain space but even at work I have not find my "crowd". 
You have to realize not everyone need Bitcoin, blokchain based systems or cryptocurrencies. We have a lot of questions we feel like we have the answer but we it is still a bet. Is it going to be the way people fund their retirement? is it an hedge against financial crisis? does it empower people? is it a real alternative to fiat? I can scream YES to all that but not everyone will listen to me.
Sometimes I come here to find interesting discussion but then it is just about price or meme or some silly debate. So it might be easier to stop speaking about it. Or say: "you don't trust Bitcoin but you trust me so let me do this and we will see in the long run". 
That's my 2 sats ;-)

I think privacy will be increasingly important, specially compared to things like Libra. I am glad Bitcoin is advancing the work on that front. Also when people use lightning, we will have more answers on what layer 2 scaling should like.
I like smart contract, gaming + blockchain, interoperability( I really like the idea of an internet of blockchains). I am not much of a "tokenize everything" person and I still struggle to support consortium/ private blockchains. I like new ways to make people use and earn cryptocurrencies. DeFi(decentralized finance) is interesting, as long as it doesn't just bring wall street in. I hope we find ways to pay artists and other content creators on internet.
So yeah it may seem slow but the whole ecosystem is advancing.

@_date: 2019-02-25 22:51:24
So you first convert your binary number to a decimal number, assuming your calculator can do that.
Then you find the formula of elliptic operations and you compute your public key, that is, a point on the curve. 
Finally you can send that public key to the sender and hopefully they don't mess up the conversion. I am here assuming that you don't do hash computations on your calculator.

This is why they are taking their time. I had money in the DAO and I just assume I lost most of my money (which would have been fine actually with the price rise :-D). I have no money in Parity multisig but I feel like it wouldn't change my view about not forking.

@_date: 2017-11-22 10:45:11
Each blockchain is designed for a purpose and Bitcoin is far from that I would say.
Also Ethereum is good for its own purpose, smart contracts. For value transfer it is too complicated because you might interact with a contract at some point( state trie). 
I want each blokchain to reach its own potential like for privacy you would pick Monero or Zcash.

It's hard to say it doesn't look like a ponzi scheme. I want the good intent to stay the main focus and I am afraid the majority will just make bitcoin a market *yo-yo* with crazier fluctuations.

* I hope the legal system will rely more and more and blockchain proofs like that.  
* I didn't know Hivemind. Looking at it now.
*Too bad for Enigma. It was an awesome concept (my previous company felt they would become our competitor :-D).

The possibilities seems endless... but what have we done so far? I use BTC to send phone refill to my family. Except that, I sent money to wikipedia but that's it for me as for using BTC for something else than trading.

There is since you hope that by connecting to a lot of nodes, enough will tell you the truth.

I don't know if we should have gone segwit + block increase. It seems like a decent compromise for right now in addition to all the other for the longer term. I want to be able to use bitcoin everyday if not the *moon* would be capped. At 1 BTC = $2.000.000 it would be hard to say to people to keep jumping in.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:12:50
I am in the type of user who thinks that the price means nothing!!! Price tag doesn't tell you the intrisic value of a coin ( technical value, ecosystem development, community dynamism, innovation ...)
Btw, economically, if you are a *hodler*, it makes more sense to just keep your coins from before the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:05:34

I just wanted to see if it was worth coming that often here if there was not much for me to learn. I might start considering going on bitcointalk and maybe the mailing list for way later ;-). I might remember wrong but it wasn't like that before the fork. I would stumble upon post from the core team for example. There was always something to learn.

@_date: 2019-02-06 15:40:48
I agree to the idea of using only what you need. Why should you use btc, eth, doge ...? For example to make a donation to wikipedia, I used bitcoin. I don't see the point of using something else for my task. For micro-payment on reddit, I would think to use dogecoin. But now, with lightning taking off, I should reconsider that
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:53:19


I follow quite a few cryptocurrencies now. Bitcoin is still, as an blockchain application, the purest and the simplest to explain/grasp.

@_date: 2017-11-21 15:41:24


People don't usually point to all those extra services than money transfer. They should be build on the top to bitcoin which I don't think needs layer2 yet.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:27:05
I am still reluctant to go push everything to layer 2. I guess that's a bit naive in this age but I can't make my mind about that.
Also, I a fear a bit those punishments and deposit losses. If I would attack, that's where I would start. I would join a channel just when there is a bit of rush on an exchange and try to take advantage of them.
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:50:49
OK lol. you have my upvote for the effort.
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:27:32

You can add phone refill from one place to another(ex: Europe to Africa). It is also nice that there are not only uses related to illegal use.

@_date: 2017-11-22 10:25:13
I think in one comment, someone pointed that there should be more ways to get bitcoin than mining. That would push more people to use it. If not we have to wait for the price to stabilize at an insane level so that storing won't make very much sense, like storing fiat now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:15:00
For once, I will upvote a meme. Tired of them but this is spot on.

@_date: 2019-12-02 16:09:41
You should check first which one is available from the exchange you are buying.  I am not sure the **bc1** is supported by everyone yet, even though it is advancing.
So the **legacy** one is most like supported by everyone. There are questions about security (if you followed the bitcoin vs bitcoin cash fork) but you should not care, for **segwit** address.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:29:32
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:22:29
then they ask you which coin to choose! When you start answer about what is "inside the belly" of the coin they just dismiss you and say "hey this coin went up, then I will just buy this one". 
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:57:28
scary isn't it?
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:29:56
Or if the price gets so high that it stabilized. If the price is only pushed through newcomers arriving and no other economic activity, then it is bound to stabilized. I view bitcoin price more like a logarithmic curve than an exponential one. 
Also if you have more ways to get Bitcoin, it won't bother you to spend some now since you can earn them back tomorrow. People would have a huge cold wallet and a tiny hot wallet for everyday use.
I clearly have no idea how to push the transaction side over the holding side. Maybe segwit and Lightning will make a difference. And I also want a Tesla :-)
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:16:15

You have to admit that the barrier to entry is rather low. You have the insurance that you actually own it and that it is the coin you wanted to buy with minimal trust.  Of course you need to learn a lot before using it but it is worth it and empowering.

I second that. With company pouring more money in there, the pressure will get bigger and we end up on being centralized like the GAFA etc.

What matters is that you generate the address in your ledger so it does not need to be plugged to receive. Your public addresses receive the money not the ledger. The nano let's you spend. For instance, you could generate an address on your ledger and copy it somewhere, save it somewhere, then send your coins from the exchange to it. You don't need the ledger until you want to spend and you can use and explorer to see that the coin went through. Btw *ledger live* does not ask you to plug the nano all the time.


Yes you have to understand that anyone with those words can spend all your coins. If I know you words, I put them on my nano S, and your coin are gone. Important advice is to NEVER EVER put them online or in anything else than your nano.


 Is that all I need to do because I've seen people talking about using different addresses and public and private addresses and I don't know much about it .
That's pretty much it. It i your choice to use a new address but sometimes, with some exchanges it is not convenient because you need validate each address while other exchanges don't.


Very good idea. The wallet on your phone would be your hot wallet while your nano would be your cold wallet.
I can recommend you to explore ledger website and don't hesitate to ask questions in their reddit or even here.
Good luck and be safe.

I think the majority don't see the same issue with the banking system as we do. They might find it slow or expensive but that's usually it. No issue with it's centralization until it's too late generally.
As for your explanations, I generally avoid speaking too specifically about the miners role. I found that it was where I confuse people.
Some applications I like:
* notarization. If the court will start to accept blockchain based proofs that would be awesome. 
* access control. 
* ownership/asset trading and tracking.  
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:12:54
Tx propagation was the bottleneck. We need to study how the improvements impacted it. If this time is negligible compared to the block time, then we could do a various combination of block time and lock size reduction. 
So what I am saying is that we should study the current state of the network before deciding what needs or needs not to be done. It is not just about fees or size, it is about the system.

@_date: 2018-03-18 17:29:51
It might not be a popular idea but I think, looking at the whole ecosystem, a fair price is between $100 and $1000. We have too much uncertainty around the markets (pump and dump, fake volume, tether problem, lack of regulations/audit of exchanges, insider trading, ...). The tech fundamentals vs the usage (I would say that the *real* usage is when people buy/trade non crypto-assets with bitcoin) is not good enough to be worth $10K-$20K.
But who am I to call the market irrational, since the market is *always* right?!

I just disagree on Western Union. It might depend onthe country but if you can send the money online, it is very very fast. Less than 10 minutes.
Also, I don't see why they speak so much about fees since theyare comparing just the speed.
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:28:52
No it is not apples and oranges. Or actually it is since you want to make a fruit salad. 
You have to compare what we want to build and what exist. I receive money from friends with 0 confirmations from an ATM in Montreal. I sent money to family using Western Union and it is comparatively quicker. I mean if the only thing you can compare cryptocurrencies too are cryptocurrencies we won't get anywhere beyond the pet fight *my coin is bigger than yours*.
I agree a lot of things happen behind the scene and those companies are OK loosing a bit of money here and there when it's time for settlement.

@_date: 2018-03-01 16:38:00
I don't want to mix the fees in the discussion of speed because the article didn't compare both properly and should have compare it to paypal.
By 0 confirmation, I meant that I didn't have to wait because it was a friend sending the money and seeing the tx pending was more than enough.
I am wondering if anyone did a proper *speed + fees* comparison. Of course it is not a complete comparison unless you add security in the chart.

Do you realize they is an insane amount of research in economy that went into our monetary system? Keynesian methods might be bad but there is are other *school of thoughts*, other monetary systems around the world. As a currency, Bitcoin i pretty bad because it is not flexible and it set in stone. I am saying, for what we know, we need to be able to move the supply depending on he health of the economy. I know it was over-abused now in the fiat systems but there is a middle ground somewhere. Anyway...
I don't like the way you define *being backed*. Bitcoin is more or less secure by what you mentioned. If you were right, this would set the censorship resistance value but we all know that is not the main reason behind the price.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:42:50
Putting aside Ethereum, I don't think the other ICOs are worth anything really... yet.

Can you PM me more detail? I would like to take a look.
@_date: 2019-09-19 16:02:40
Beyond the whole usability question, the whole point of asymmetrical cryptography is to have a public and a private key. They are supposed to be used differently. So actually, what you want to do is to prove the ownership of the **public** key, not the **private** key, hence the signature. 
So you do not have much choices, either you just give the private key, obviously a very bad idea, either you do some maths operations that the verifier can verify with the public key, which is a signature.
@_date: 2018-07-05 23:44:50

Come to the dark side ....
@_date: 2019-09-10 08:43:11
* the fact that bitcoin does just soft fork and no hardfork. Of course it is a choice that we manage to stick to. But at the same time, I feel like we would be able to clean up some things or "upgrade" in cleaner way.
* related to the previous point, the fact that we did a soft fork for segwit and then  get annoyed by people not using it. that's the point of a soft fork, to let people have the choice. 
* unclear if people want complex smart contract on Bitcoin or not. I feel people don't really want it and I think it is not such a bad thing.
* people are putting unrealistic expectations on lightning for scalability as it is some sort of holy grail and then the work will be done. There are still things to figure out but I like where lightning is going.
* we have some contradictions we don't brag about like "no spec for the bitcoin node, the code is the spec and we want one main implementation" vs "lightning approach is to have multiple clients with a common spec"
* maximalism/minimalism since I am more on the internet of blockchain, interop, atomic swaps etc. side
* too much talk some/often times about price, market cap, %, and very little on the revolution we are starting. I believe we are not really appreciating the change Bitcoin brought. The whitepaper is still one of my favourite research paper.
* the whole "institutionalization of Bitcoin": ETF, futures, options, trading, synthetic product. I found that scary and contradicting the Bitcoin "ethos". It was a "main street" thing and people are wishing for "wall street". I prefer a small growth with much more people than a parabolic one with a few. Strength in the numbers!
 That what I can think of right now. I think it is healthy to be criticize and scrutinize what you really like. That is how we can make it better. Can you share the link from years ago btw?

How would you do that? 
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:50:12
Maybe you are looking at the wrong place to start. I don't think cryptocurrencies tried to solve the general currencies issues. They just focus on disintermediation of a lot of use cases. We have to realize that money is a social construction so Tech alone won't fix anything. 
For example look at the fix supply. Most economist think this is very bad, or not flexible enough, but average people are happy. Why? Because there is more clarity about the amount. So in a sense, what we really want is that users get more control about how our financial system works.
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:13:06
Can we stop with those posts? I mean this is just like shouting *hack me f you can*.
@_date: 2019-09-19 16:10:21
it usually the easier way but not the only one. The way the pasphrase is stored/encrypted can be broken or too old. Before we try to stop GPUs with functions like scrypt, we had to just slow down the CPU attacks. Even for scrypt, you need to use the proper parameters and a secure hash function. Constant battle as usual in security.

@_date: 2019-09-30 08:59:26
I see some comments about how Bitcoin does already smart contracts but I think you all know what we are talking about. And we should be clear, today, that they are not coming to Bitcoin. It is not even a debate at this point. Of course I would prefer a DAI style stablecoin instead of tether. OF course I would love more complex use cases/programs on Bitcoin but we choose to do without. And this is fine. So I agree with Andreas.
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:50:20

@_date: 2018-04-16 15:19:38
Hi, PhD student on blokchain here. So I have a few questions \(I mainly read the tl;dr and skimmed through the paper so I am sure I missed a lot of things\):
* There is this \*idea\* that cryptocurrencies follow a trilemma between scalability, security\(censorship resistance in your work\) and decentralisation\(i think this is the same as your \*trustlessness\*\). Any idea how scalability, which relates to usability, could be taken into account in your study?
* By the way, it would be awesome to have mainstream media write about censorship resistance. It is often overlooked.
* What do you think of incentives that are not financial like how full nodes are not paid to verify or how a miner will continue mining even if it is not profitable for some time? The ideology is the big part of the bitcoin narrative.
* Are you planning to study different consensus type \(like the mention on Ripple\)? Anything you want to share on that?
* How did you decide which model to use for the decentralized network? 
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:37:39

* France reduced taxes for people who already paid huge taxes and now can go from 45% to 35%. This is not most of the people.
* Selling occasionally below 5000€ won't be taxed but it will if you do it too frequently(note: the frequency was not define).
* If you partake in the *ecosystem* like mining, you are taxed as before( not fixed and it depends on your revenue).
All in all, I think they are scaring the average people who want to jump in. [better guide in French](
@_date: 2018-04-18 08:23:59
thanks I will put that on my list ;\-\)

@_date: 2018-04-27 11:46:52
I don't think most of the *non crypto rich* bought that early. Maybe as you say most people are happy about it but I don't think so (still, I may be mistaken and taking my personal situation as the default).

Can you explain why it is not a desirable attribute to have CPU mining edging GPU mining? 
To push it to extreme, would it bother you if smartphones could mine? The idea that average people can contribute to the security is appealing to me. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:09:47

@_date: 2017-07-13 12:40:09
@_date: 2017-07-26 08:16:31
same feeling!
@_date: 2017-07-14 09:57:38
I have a feeling we have a *theory vs practice* debate.
In theory, I want the Blockchain protocol to be as secure as possible, before building apps and services on the top of it. 
In practice, we already have a bunch of users and the majority go through an abstraction layer. 
Good or Bad, I think that the blockchains which abstracts the tech details will hit more the mainstream domain than *pure Bitcoin via Bitcoin Core soft*. Like Steem or Game.
Back to the security of Bitcoin, I think it's not clear who are the targetted users: Average Joe, Geeks, exchanges. However you want to call it, maybe not *product* as something you get on a store and stuff, let's say a box, it has to be secure. Whether you build bigger box on the top or no, I agree that security is important.  But to assess the security of my box, I need to look at it as a whole. The bigger the box, the more likely I run into problems. 
I just get the feeling that the security concerns don't take in account the actual uses (not talking about what we would want). Clearly I might be wrong but since I build secure app, I see those type of issue all the time.
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:59:28
I would say most of the people *dealing* with Bitcoin don't run a node, hence a Bitcoin node. Most users go through exchange and other *user friendly* wallet.

I disagree with stating that secure software goes in opposition with normal ones. That's how you make software that no one uses. It's a lot of trade-offs, to be accurate.

As for the monopolies, this is a very hard one. Except if you have a proposition for IoT chips to mine, I don't see a proper solution for this problem.

I am basing myself on those two research paper:
* 
* 
I am also trying to build a blockchain comparison platform to pinpoint the bottlenecks.
From that , I can say that *it seems* we can do better. Now is it worth it? I think so. I think the advantages are worth it. I do believe Bitcoin would go through such an update without much issue. I understand the risk this represents. But that is what I think on the matter. We need a scientific approach on that, test our hypothesis and assumptions and see what we can improve. If not what the point of doing research?
I sadly think the debate missed the real problems/solutions and became too much about politics. I also wish we could discuss and study the question in a healthy way about that. I am sure I didn't consider everything on advantages/disadvantages. I knew I would get some downvote but I still want to discuss about it.
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:55:28
This might be just me wondering but why isn't there a core version with BIP148 then? I mean seriously!

@_date: 2017-07-21 09:01:52

No one understand anything.
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:35:18

@_date: 2017-07-14 00:58:00
I don't see why since you don't think about security in terms of stack. This usually doesn't work and it's better to look at the product as a whole. This why I think Peter Todd raises valid point but forget to mention that the security hypothesis have to be aligned with how most users interact with Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-05-09 16:08:35
We have to remember there are 3 powers: dev - miners - nodes. Exchanges might be important nodes, but the economic majority is in the hands of the users. They choose which chain has value. There are enough (spin-offs) hardfork chains to remind us of that.

For those who want to check the draft:
Last year, Bitcoin was picked in second position overall and this was a bad choice :-D. This year the lead is pretty insane with Bitcoin. Even if the price remains around 8K and the rest of the stock performs normally, he will win.

You are not the only one. I am running an old version of bitcoin core. Now I haven't decided what to do.

with segwit, it's 11 tx/s.

But Hayek wanted to give it to banks, not back to people.

He has  the right to voice his opinions/ideas. There is an equilibrium of power in Bitcoin that make re-org like that hard to do. So I prefer to have a thorough analysis of the game theory than just burying my head and hope for the best.

I assume like you that the dev read those papers but I haven't read what they think about. The only thing I recall mention is that the information propagation was not the main focus (I think it was on bitcointalk and it was greg or peter. I can find the link If you want). For instance the way block and tx are propagated were improved and I think this significantly raise what Bitcoin can do. But I haven't tested it yet and I haven't seen anyone doing it yet. 
 I am saying "seems" because I am not going to says "is" when we are pondering assumptions. Experts is a very big word, specially for a the little PhD student I am. I do understand the risks and I do understand that the consensus is on your side. 
So changing the parameters does not mean forking necessarily. what do you think about this proposal: set up a network, testnet if you will, where we can benchmark our assumptions? Benchmark it like crazy and pinpoint where we have issue. Then if it sucks, there won't be any more discussions. End of the story and we can focus on other things.

I think the same and I don't think I read a response that I find convincing. Specially after studying block/tx propagation in the network. It seems that increasing the size x4 or equivalently reducing the block time to 2.5 min, is safe.

I am pretty sure I will set up a lightning node mainly to support the network. I have seen some website and service built  on the top of lightning but so far nothing that motivates me to participate. I also do not expect to make any money opening channels.
So yeah, I will take the time to do it but this might not be any time soon.

I thought I was the only one totally lost in the debate !
@_date: 2017-06-13 09:36:52
not of course. Some people like you or me root for the whole crypto-space. So I don't care about the *flippening*.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:13:39
Just because some altcoin (I think we should stop using that word now) does it better doesn't mean Bitcoin doesn't have use cases. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:50:28
I so agree!!
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:36:42
yeah not everyone is a day-to-day trader.
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:45:44
I would use the ledger image: 
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:10:35
also it doesn't say that the price was, overall, going higher! So you are looking at correlation, not cause-effect. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:42:39
sufficient fees? Between a SEPA transfer that cost nothing but takes time, or paypal that is faster and have lower fees, you want people to choose bitcoin which is more complicated and more expensive to use?
I hope we don't need to pay that much for a decent service. Whatever the solution...
@_date: 2017-06-13 09:35:12
Side question: is there any .onion service that let you broadcast your transactions?
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:41:36
The Pandora box is already open. We have more people, enterprise, governments thinking: **"why not?"**
@_date: 2019-05-28 11:51:10
I would say it does not really matter since Bitcoin mature enough on its own.
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:16:38
This is really really crazy.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:11:22
the one I wrote for work and that brings blockchain as a trust party to ehance security. also all the ponzi schemes out there :-)
@_date: 2017-07-11 12:05:02
you are about to get ....

From all your posts I gather you check your addresses online and realize the thieves didn't take the money yet, right?
