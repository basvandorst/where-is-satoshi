It isn't money. It doesn't have all the characteristics of money like portability, fungibility etc.

bip32 is the standard for HD wallets. It has nothing to do with having a different address for each transaction. Even non-deterministic wallets like bitcoin core use a different address per transaction.

1Mb/s is enough to run a node. It doesn't use much bandwidth except during the initial sync.

You can keep using any old addresses in your wallet as long as you like.

What will you do if you live past 80? Not good man. You need to think about living till 100 at least. It's possible today. With medical advances it will be expected in your lifetime.

That is not fair at all. It's a file called release-notes in the project's github repo. Where else did you expect it to be? 
It's also in the forum:

That's actually bigotry. Those same people are fine with high frequency trading on wall street. But if the Chinese do it it's somehow not right.

People will take money. Even bad money. It's called gresham's law. You can look it up.

What happens if you forget the password for the gpg key? Or lose the gpg key?

With 2.0 it's even easier. There is a command line option to provide your own entropy. Type `electrum help` to see it.

Ok but the real question is is getting it right?
@_date: 2015-03-03 09:23:58
Electrum aims to be minimalistic so they are not going to do multiple wallets in one window. You can use file &gt; new/restore to create a new wallet and file &gt; open to open a different wallet.
If you insist on multiple wallets in one window then multibit is a better choice. Their new HD version is dead easy to use too.

You've got that backwards. Bad money drives out good money. People hoard good money and put bad money back into circulation.


The bitcoin block reward changes according to the block count, right? So you can have inflation. The block reward would increase over time to maintain the same relative inflation in money supply.

You are accessing the site via ssl so how could it be tampered with?

What exactly do you mean by smart contracts? If you mean arrangements where one private key is revealed should a certain event occur and that allows one of the parties of the contract to get the funds then we already have that with reality keys. Problem is that it's really really complicated to use. And their fact database is crap. You would need support from application programmers to make it easier to use.
The other type of contract is where you store some data in the blockchain and that is supposed to represent a real world asset or real world contract. This requires enforcement in the real world and that means government.

It sells the software. There used to be boxed editions of RH.
Free download is not a requirement of the GPL. Providing source code is. RH doesn't have a free download except for source RPMs. This is only because by default it doesn't include srpms with its distribution. But if you were to sell the software in source form you wouldn't have to provide free downloads of anything.
CentOS takes the sRPMs and puts together a distro using it. If RH was providing a free download there would be no need for CentOS or scientific linux.

I don't think they have one of those for titcoin.

You don't need the offline wallet to show all the addresses. It will sign transactions nevertheless. I assume you have seen the tutorial about how to sign transactions with the offline wallet? It's linked below for your reference:

Hoard it. What else?

People are buying bitcoin because it is deflationary. So no one who owns bitcoin is going to vote for an inflationary version of it.

What wallet? Different wallets have different mnemonic formats. 
If it's electrum then what version? The current stable 1.9.8 or the beta 2.0?
I'd like to know what operating system you are using as well. Linux, for example, has sha256 which you can use to convert your random input into hex.
@_date: 2015-02-24 14:12:57
No this is proprietory software for which an equally good opensource alternative exists. That's the one I pointed out.
BTW GPL allows you to sell open source software. It's free as in freedom not free as in cost. It's how redhat became a billion dollar company.

Good! It's about time we ended this paper wallet nonsense. Paper wallets are unsafe! All the experts agree. Those with a vested interest like Becker here will obviously not agree!

Mega just got cut off from all fiat processing and bitcoin is their only hope. Doesn't change the fact that consumers are not ready to adopt this currency. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 13:12:09
Pointless move. Anyone who knows about bitcoin also knows about gparted. They also know that most linux distros have parted built into the installer.

No you don't need the private keys. They can generate the private keys on their own devices and circulate their public keys among all the participants. Public keys are not secret. With the public keys you can create the multisig address and everyone can verify that that is the correct address for that set of public keys in that particular order. 
Here is an example:
It uses testnet addresses but the idea is the same.
