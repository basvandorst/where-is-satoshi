I think we just got trolled, but I desperately wanted to believe everything he wrote, you know...because bitcoin.

Then you havent paid attention in class. The total sum of assets is enough to cover all creditors...at least original. Some asshole companies is filing claims to prolong the process...Unknown reasons. But they will probably be dismissed.
Or have something changed lately?

Im stupider!
I read the whitepaper in 2010, thought it was insanely cool, wanted to invest, and sat ready with $500 to do so... got a recipe for purchasing bitcoin online read it ...and thought...meeeeeeeh.... too much. Fuck it.
I think it would be worth around $10 million now. yippi!
Instead I waited a couple of years, bought bitcoin at $500 on mtgox, and then it went belly up and now its stuck in the bankruptcy court case. Maybe it was smart in the end, cuz FORCED hodl \^\^ :D

This is not the info I have got from [mtgoxlegal.com]( \-&gt; the biggest organized group of claimants. Afaik I get 100% of my claim. Can't find the posts about it now, but will come back when I find it.

Its just the best way to invest for most non-pros.
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:13:38
You are right that it made you more money, but its a bad example of investing. I wrote what I did to deter others from the doing the same.
Happy for you though. Wish I had some of that luck :)
@_date: 2019-11-08 23:17:26
I dont understand the point of bitcoin atms. Can someone explain why my phone isnt a million times easier to use to buy bitcoin... *anywhere*
@_date: 2019-11-04 19:52:07
Yeh. You shouldve DCA’ed it
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:38:02
Who in their right mind would buy bitcoin to use it for anything when the market can be manipulated to this extent.
Hodl, whales, sell high buy low is ALL about trading and becoming millionaires on ot, not at all anything to do with actually using the coin for anything.
Early game? When the is the price going to stabilize? it needs to stabilize before people can use it for anything other than a risky investment.  And for it to stabilize people needs to start using it... 
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:44:44
Maybe they could funnel some of that salt into its own product? Good salt is hard to come by these days I heard.
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:43:04
Unicorns are behind bitcoin and dark elves behind btc!!!
Worth discussing?
@_date: 2019-10-21 14:11:49
Wouldnt it be great if our credit companies could block any transaction they saw fit?! 
Wait... uh
@_date: 2019-10-01 17:56:51
I haven't said anything else... I was explaining a concept to someone, albeit faulty, I didnt try to pose any opinion on bitcoin's future.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:17:12
seriously? Crypto is a super sensible and stable investment opportunity...only way is UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT from here!
@_date: 2019-10-01 09:43:11
Thanks for informative answer
@_date: 2019-10-01 09:42:57
How would you double the keyspace of SHA-256?
@_date: 2019-10-19 00:07:53
Fuck you are spending a shit load of money on non-essentils arent you?

So change the encryption algorithm, huh? Well... that doesnt mean that the current wallets will be secure against the brute force, does it?  
Which is the entire point of the discussion...  
I got a better answer as to why brute force isn't terribly relevant to the case by someone else, so thanks for your opinion.
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:24:22
Problem is that upvote brigades fudge the post relevance and therefor has to be modded... sadly
@_date: 2019-08-11 08:24:45
Bitcoiners think this is good for bitcoin? Let alone crypto in general...?

Large shorts has been liquidated because the trader didnt set a proper stop.
Its funny because if you dont set stops you are a retard and want to lose all your money.

The only way to help bitcoin is simply: Ask your vendors, any vendor, to accept bitcoin as payment.

That a tiny exchange grew a bit from day 1 to now.
@_date: 2019-02-21 12:35:08
How on earth is this a valid comparison to bitcoin???
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:02:36
I have a bitcoin!!! It's in the mtgox bankrupcy fund. Yey!
@_date: 2019-02-16 14:17:53
no its total amount, which is around $2,5 million?   
not sure what everyone is cheering about.
@_date: 2019-02-16 18:59:18
Its a shitty manipulative graph that does not at all show the whole picture. That's all. This is how it really is:  
@_date: 2019-10-18 15:52:56
Oh? Your wallet doesnt «support» my currency? Well fuck. Just a second, 1 hour, and Ill buy some of the currencies you do support... wait where did you go?
Crypto needs to focus on usability. NOW!
Nerd money is not good enough.
@_date: 2019-06-19 03:26:11
The hacking of connectu and fake profiles is honestly the only thing I thought was bad here. Getting rid of dead weight in business is a fucking necessity if you want to succeed and grow.
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:06:03
well...automation will throw a wrench in here somewhere. There wont be many jobs at all in the near future.

its a symbol for Jesus. Christians put it on their cars to show Jesus he can hitch a ride with them if he wishes. Usually positioned next to the sticker of a family with 7 children and 4 dogs.

nah...america is real. But its more of a tv-show than a country. 
@_date: 2019-09-15 19:26:26
It wont be for everyone if this focus on price continues
@_date: 2019-09-29 17:50:20
ok? what is wrong with that?
@_date: 2019-09-15 12:10:51
Did satoshi ever write anything about hodling?

A game is a physical object?
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:33:59
Is a computer game physical? No.
Can it be delivered to your door physically? Yes
Ill leave the rest up to you.

In general:
Brute force: testing all possible combinations of encryption key basically. When you try the correct one you know it is.
Quantum computers are good at this problem because they can «test» a lot of these keys simultaneously because of the characteristixs of qubits; they can be both 0 and 1 at any given time.

Tried to run ubunutu and debian linux for my htpc laptop instead of win 10. Never had so much trouble with my computer in my life. Not going to spend hours and hours making something obvious work like it does with winodws.
