the internet doesnt necessarily need these centralized and government infastructures just so happens that it was started this way, we could easily change the internet infastructure through radio waves , blue tooth and wireless technology in a decentralized infrastructure way. it will be harder to cross the planet without the sattelites and undersea cables but no one will be able to stop, isps will be obsolete. it as long as two or more people decide to connect then we have a network data is carried by photon , electricity and radio waves it belongs to the universe and we are all part of the universe. think about that.  and im happy that because of blockchain and DLT people are waking up and moving to this new world. Its not too crazy to think that even infrastructure becomes decentralized too.
