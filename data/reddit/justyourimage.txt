Well you can predict technical disasters to some extend. 
Optional On-Chain scaling solutions (SegWit) and non-trivial Off-Chain scaling solution that will be release god knows when - that in the end 75% of exchanges will just ignore let alone users. Just look at Coin - FCKing - Base.
Now just add ~~Schroedinger~~ Schnorr Signatures being optional too, being released in 2020 or later ...
Yes Lightning might be still useful - for large scale transactions between bigger parties or enthusiastic 1% fans.
You don't even need to do TA, you can see how desperately people are buying into scammy Altcoins that supposedly fix it all, magically with Ponyhorses and Flowers. Not.

If you put your hands on your ears and begin to chant while someone speaks to you it can be certainly not called a misunderstanding.
I'm talking about you, Reuters, Bloomberg and CNBC - you all just put yourself on the same low level. Like sewer level.

Ok fuck you how often do you intend to repost this? I'll keep posting my comment ...
Quoted from Bloomberg with this specifical part removed:


Reuter is worse then Bloomberg, but even Bloomberg is pretty desperate to release news without confirmed sources.

Reuters is even worse then Bloomberg yet people believe its a reputable source.

Well you shouldn't buy when the price has already exploded so you're still good. Monero had an steady but small  increase while that crazy alt-rally so I'd go for it - it has good room for growth. Short, mid and long term. Maybe even explosive growth, but don't take my word for it. DYOR.

Oh wow my friend your whole post sounds so emotionally disturbed that its not even funny anymore. Especially if you're coming from economics. There are things you can't learn - like not bringing emotions in such markets. Money is just as illusional as Bitcoin is - at least the later one can't be endlessly printed like shit since it requires an unproportionally increasing amount of processing power the more there is rolled out. We never left the housing market crash period and the US Dollar is nearly worthless. There's a reason Russia and Asian countries give no shit about US dollars anymore. Bitcoin is certainly the smaller devil of whats happening in this world. Especially if you take into consideration that its borderless and can't even be compared to the dotcom bubble, but who am I talking to? You most likely have your fixed opinion based on your limited point of view and can't dare to look around the edge. After all you could be wrong. Dare you say that.
All you do is spread fear around. Sorry but I'm aware of the risks, I'm just not emotionally driven by it. Bubble, ponzy, greater fools scheme - feel free throwing around examples from the past and superlatives - it won't change a thing.

Under 10k together with many self-proclaimed pro day traders and bitcoinhaters posting about armageddon fully ignoring the upcoming news today and at the start of 2018. Basically any neutral view that involves the market outlook for 2018 besides whats happening right now. Head and shoulder patterns, ponzy schemes, ... yada yada whatnot.

It still amuses me how people think Bitcoin could be compared to a single centralized entity even remotely.
Even if a plethora of exchanges goes down or if Trump or Kim Young Un decides to ban Bitcoin the rest of the world will just fart away at it and it will continue to exist under the tables increasing the price even further (think about the alcohol prohibition)
Even if all miners move away you can just start your own with 2 participants and its up again.
There are a few threats that are very real to Cryptocurrencies but those are certainly not it.

Fine with me if you speculate without looking at what you throw your money at, that also means you're not able to see the whole picture as such you aren't able to make sound decisions. TA is a fraction of it all.
Thats no better then those morons that think they can stick their money into something for years seeing it magically growing without any sweet. But those are often so stupid that it works out anyway UNLESS they give in to the panic and opinions of unkown internet strangers.

Next target will be ETH mark my words. He already posted something scary about it on Twitter. He's certainly not done yet - whatever gives him more money he'll ride that horse.
I wonder why he´s getting refuge in any country.

Thank the people behind s2x and futures that actually made it happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:11:53
No. 
The difference is when it´s not just moving money but planing such things to manipulate the market like removing hashing power and canceling planned forks last minute. Why do you think this post from back in july is so frighteningly accurate (minus it crushing BTC yet) ? 
There is a difference in a trader taking advantage of a situation and one creating this situation artificially with inside information, power and wealth.
It´s called market manipulation and it´s criminal activity that should have consequences (not saying it will ever) no matter how you put it.

So think about those 850.000 bitcoins that went "missing" with Mt. Gox ... thats just a starting point of 6 Billion USD in one hand (and that is said if the person in charge didn't invest them to get more out of it)  if you take that one BTC was worth aprox $7.200 USD just recently.
That might be very well just the doing of a few people that initiated it all by moving such large amounts to slow the network down. Of course more are following now. Its the horde-effect. The mind of masses can be manipulated rather easily if enought are doing the same. Or how do you think ponzy schemes like BCC or even more traditional sects could happen then?
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:33:38
And you think cash (regular and BCH) is a good store of wealth? People are seriously stupid. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:22:32
Bitcoin is different in this regard. Unlike with penny stocks or stocks the coin is bound to pure computation power as such you cannot give out just another penny stock paper if you feel like it.
Also cashing out is not as easy as you think it is. If a lot of people try cashing out the network will become slower as in almost coming to a halt since all transactions are executed by the miners and they don't have endless computation powers. Meaning they prefer those that pay higher fees until it gets to the point of them being ridiculous high and slow as well. Given that there are often limits in place of how much you can cash out per day/week/month will only make matters worse. 
As such an headless mass panic will often be grind to an halt before it even begins. If it comes to exiting the crypto-market as a whole that is.
2018 things will change a lot which will make it hardly predicitable. Speakingly futures for BTC (supposed to launch this december) and technology advancements regarding Off-Chain transactions for example the Lightning Network that takes Miners out of the equation when it comes to swap coins with the same cryptographically base like Bitcoin, LTC, VTC, GRC with minimal fees and way faster transactions.
In my opinion Crypto is no different than anything else. You cannot expect endless growth and staying ahead of the game by mindless holding (think Yahoo shares back in the dot-com-bubble where people expected for them to recover, which they never did).
Some people never learn.
