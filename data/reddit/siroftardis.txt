Great, they only tax me like 5% of my income.

I believe he meant the money he could have had by then if he didn't buy spend Bitcoin on the ring, not the half that she could never access.

Sounds like Latvia. Good thing I left. I work in a tax haven now haha.

Who cares if women are more interested in crypto or not? Seriously. If they want to, they will come. There is nothing stopping them and nothing to be sad about. Not everything has to be 50/50 
I could just as well complain that it is sad that only 1% of ballet dancers are men and we should strive for more inclusive ballet. 
Why feminism and not menism?
Fyi- I am female myself even though my username suggests otherwise. Deal with it.

There is one, but you missed it. It was in February. I think the 23

Here is something to stop the fud. Something that can integrate crypto into our everyday lives: 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:59:54
And this in the main reason that crypto exists. No one can take it away (as long as you don't keep your coins on exchanges).

Also a lot of wallets are empty. I myself created two wallets that I won't ever use as a means of understanding how they work.

Not anymore there aren't. You're welcome.

Mars would have to have a separate cryptocurrency run on mars servers used between martians with a possibility to exchange it to the earth cryptocurrencies

Ah, thanks :) Now I feel a bit foolish. Should have known...

Of course. At least in the way that they currently exist. Blockchain has made them obsolete.

Well, it is good in the way that it has no nationality, therefore conflicts could be avoided between all the different nationalities on earth. A bit like the language esperanto, which helps people communicate without either party feeling subservient or dominant.

I am a user and I do quite like it. Seeing as I don't currently own a computer, mobile apps are my only option and from all the available ones, Revolut offers the most options. It gives me a personal bank account to which I can easily and seamlessly send funds from my primary account in another bank, It lets me convert my money to many other fiat currencies and to bitcoin, etherium and litecoin. I would love to have more varietyin the crypto options, but I don't see any other app allowing me to do so. They even send you your own debit card, so everything you send to your Revolut card, you can still spend when you need to. Even if you only have crypto on it, it will instantly convery the crypto to fiat when you make a purchase. 
There is a complaint from a lot of people that Revolution doesn't give you your own crypto wallet with a piblic/private key, but instead keeps all crypto on an internal server, but it doesn't bother me much, because it makes it easier for people who are new to crypto to not accidentally mess up.
Of course now that I have some more crypto understanding, I would love to find something with access to more different cryptos and the abolity to spend your crypto without having to exchange it for fiat, but there is not yet an app that can do that, so I will probably just have to get a computer eventually.

Had the same thing happen to me with Lloyds bank recently. ~90 pound overdraft plus fees I had no idea about until I got a letter in the mail. Took the card back and had it cut up. Only using revolut now. They are the only ones that haven't let me down yet.
