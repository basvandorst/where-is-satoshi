I bought about a $1000 worth at $115, didn't check the other exchanges and campbx was really high at the time.  Oh well, close enough to $100.  Was trying to get some at $70-$80, but my funds hadn't cleared yet.  
Seeing where it goes Monday.

How safe is this process for creating an offline wallet that I can view with blockchain.info?  
The paper wallet address is generated while offline, then just the public key is viewable from blockchain.info.  Can I make transfers to it if I disconnect from the internet, load priv key temporarily, then reconnect to let transaction through or should I make a new offline wallet for every transaction?

could always mine some litecoin with your gpu, convert it to btc or hold it for a bit.   I've been trading back and forth and making a bit of money.

could still possibly make some mining in a litecoin pool with your gpu, then exchanging for bitcoin.
