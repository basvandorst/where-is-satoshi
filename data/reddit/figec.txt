The point is that the money is likely from businesses that get unfair favorable treatment from their governments.  That is the true scandal.  The money they skimp on when not paying taxes is nothing in compared to what they are fleecing from their own governments.
The outrage is being directed unfairly against the idea of offshore banking when the outrage should be that these politicians are using their elected positions to abuse the trust given to them by the voters to steal from government coffers.

1) Transaction speed will be addressed by Lightning Network and will be faster than (c)ripple.

3) Banks and investment houses started using Bitcoin before Ripple. 
4) Point 4 is really a rehash of point 3. 
5) Transactions per second will be addressed by LN and at millions a second it will make Ripple’s 1,500 tps look like a joke. 
A counter point could be that all of this LN functionality is unproven roadmaps of a layer on top of Bitcoin, but I would counter this shows the strength of Bitcoin in its versatility while remaining remarkably stable as a network protocol.

Debt is money, as I said.  But that debt is not Bitcoin.
The difference with fiat and banking versus Bitcoin and banking, is that with debt and the fractional reserve, the Fed creates US Dollars using that combination (with deposits to member banks used to purchase bonds).   Because you can't loan out bonds, only US Dollars, the system creates US Dollars.  With Bitcoin, it can only be created by mining.  No bank can create Bitcoin through loans, even if it practiced fractional reserve - there is nothing on the other side of the equation to create deposits and issue bonds.

To be fair, the only argument I have with the report is the use of the term "virtual currency" instead of "digital currency."  Otherwise, the report was written appropriately for the target audience (non-technical consumers), with the CFPB's singular purpose of consumer protection, and has fairly laid out the risks.  
The only other argument I can see be made about this report is how this compares to the risk of paper dollars, but I don't think  that would be appropriate for this publication.  That is material more appropriate to compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of each and is not  for this report.

There was a URL link under the displayed address (that was only revealed with another mouse click) that I ultimately used to cut and paste the address to my wallet and discern the amount of Bitcoin to send.
What should have been been two cut and paste actions for an online wallet user turned out to be a click to reveal the address, a right click to open link options from my browser, left click to open a failed browser connection, carefully copy and paste the Bitcoin address from the URL, then carefully copy and paste the BTC amount from the same URL.

I hate to repeat myself: they used "vanish" in the vernacular appropriate to the audience. 
When MF Global collapsed, money in farmers' accounts "vanished."  It didn't actually disappear, as if Corzine burned stacks of cash in his fireplace.  The money instead was moved outside of MF Global to cover its own debts.  From a financial stand point, it vanished. From a technical standpoint, it was taken off book and wired out, almost exactly like what happened at Mt Gox. 
But you are taking the meaning of vanish in the way of "disappearing" because you, like me, are technical. The audience is financial. Vanish to them means removed from an account without a proper explanation, just like with MF Global.

I've worked on Wall Street and at The WSJ (Dow Jones).  Our entire financial system is founded on counter party trust, as it should be. The failure of a major and pioneering exchange/broker/dealer is very much a relevant event to the future of digital currencies.  Events like these force introspection (and hopefully the adoption of new practices after that introspection) and if ignored will interfere with the growth of trust needed to adopt Bitcoin for commerce.  It is right to describe doubt in the future of Bitcoin because of Mt Gox as this is not the same as saying Bitcoin is dead.

This is actually relatively clever.  True, you do have to pay the minimum amount to get you on the blockchain, but you do that once for each use case.

No, there isn't.  The wealth is not the paper.  The wealth is created by people.  The paper is merely a way to track it.
The problem isn't printing paper in and of itself.  It is when the pace of printing paper is faster than the wealth generated.
Consider this simple example.  In a hypothetical world, there are only 100 single credit bills.  In this world, you make 100 chairs.  You sell each chair for 1 credit bill.  When you make your 101st chair, you either "devalue" each chair by around a 1/100th of a credit, or you create 1 credit bill to put in to circulation to help with the transaction.  The net result is the same.  Of course, someone needs to create something in order to trade for that chair.  It's the paper that makes that swap very efficient.
In the practical world, there are loans for the consumers of chairs and any other good.  Loans move money through time: money is given in the present for the promise of generated wealth in the future.  It is easier to account for the time value of money with these loans through inflation than it is when there is deflation (a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow).  Will next year be a good year for the whole economy or will it be a bad year?  What will it be like in the 10th year of that loan?  No one knows.  Writing a loan contract gets complicated and ultimately it is the person loaning the money who has the most risk so no loans would be made (or only really really expensive loans are made).  That's why we are supposed to print money.  Each year you figure out what wealth is generated and you push that money into circulation.  Loans don't need to be recalculated, the one making the loan receives the expected amount of wealth over time and the person taking the loan doesn't have to worry about working extra harder in the future to pay that loan off.
When central banks over print money, they're doing it to tax wealth.  That's a different problem altogether, but it doesn't make the printing of money itself inherently evil.  It has a very useful, and necessary (for contract writers who can't predict the future) use.
How an economy based on Bitcoin would ultimately work when there are no more bitcoins being made is subject of many debates.  I'm not certain how loans would ultimately work, but perhaps it would all be smart contracts by then where the math for wealth generation can be built in.

Here's the problem with deflation.
Consider you take a loan out for $100,000 to buy a house, at 4.4%.  You also earn $50,000 a year, in career with little prospects of promotion, so making the $500 a month payment is pretty easy.  The economy grows at, say, 3% a year.  
Let's say you never get promoted.  In a deflationary economy, your wages must drop over time.  Your wages will go down as either: 1) you take pay cuts or 2) you lose your job and your new job fairly compensates you at the now deflated market rate.  After 10 years, you're now making $41,500.  That $500 mortgage payment is starting to bite.  After 20 years, you're making $32,000 a year.  It's hurting.  You no longer have disposable income.  Your family is hungry.  You have to sell the house.  In the aggregate, this is a disaster for an economy (for an example, look at what *light* deflationary pressure has done to Japan).
Obviously, in this deflationary world, the mortgage would be structured differently so that the monthly payment at year 1 would impact as much as year 20 on your finances.  But figuring that out in a deflationary world is a problem as you can't predict how an economy is going to expand or contract.  Loans then involve much more risk - the bank being the one to bare that risk.  So banks would be less likely to make these loans, and loans are the lifeblood of an economy (because it moves money through time).
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:32:29
No, that's not how it works.  The banks don't "get money for nothing."  The money isn't just created and dropped at their door with a bunch of fat, cigar smoking bankers laughing at how stupid everyone is.
The Fed increases money supply by debits and corresponding credits on double entry account books, with US Treasuries and account credits.  The member banks gain **nothing**, except for transaction fees for servicing these US Treasuries to customers.  They're doing work on behalf of the US government, so they should be compensated for that.  That compensation is, relatively speaking, **minimal.**  Oh, and they also get to stay in business because the work they are doing keeps the monetary system alive, so there's that incentive.
The US government is able to issue these obligations for two reasons: 1) demand for US treasuries  - everyone has faith in the US being able to pay its debts (for now), and 2) the actual wealth generation against which the money supply is being created - people will need to pay taxes on that newly created wealth and that goes to paying off the new debt.
That's how things operate when the monetary supply is managed properly.  The problem is when the US creates much more of the debits and credits than what is needed, and uses these funds in deficit spending (that is to say, spending more than what the new tax revenue off of newly created wealth brought in).
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:57:29
Indeed, you are correct: the same problem exists in an inflationary system as a deflationary system.  What has made the US "special" is the belief that the inflationary system is expertly managed so that loans don't need to account for economic expansion or contraction.
There aren't two kinds of deflation, though.  What you outlined are really just two conditions of a monetary system itself: the supply of the currency and the demand of wealth represented by that currency.
As far as perfect predictions, that too is true: it can't be done.  But the US Fed does a quarterly review to determine what to do with the money supply.  So while they lag, in theory they'll only lag by three months.  In practice, they've done a **relatively** good job when compared to other currencies, which helps make the currency and its associated debt so attractive (coupled by the sheer size of the economy represented by the currency).  It is still making guesses, as you pointed out, which is why the idea of Bitcoin is so appealing as there is no guessing and no opportunity for failure.  The elegance is in the math.
The issue with the deflationary nature of Bitcoin is how to handle loans and it is a tricky issue.  It is trickier than having an inflationary currency that is managed well.  I'm not saying a US Fed managed currency is better, just that it is not evil or corrupt as those in this thread have asserted.  I'm certain it'll be solved and I suspect it will be solved with smart contracts.
To say a US Fed managed inflationary currency is corrupt is wrong.  It's almost like saying using Oxen to plow a field is evil and corrupt because you can use a gasoline tractor to pull a plow.  It's not, it's just terribly inefficient.

Savings in a Bank (or a Savings and Loan) is part of the process to move money through time, which is why you receive interest on your savings: you are giving your money to someone now, with the promise to share in the wealth that is generated later.

The chart you provided shows the amount of money in the supply.  What you fail to show is the corresponding debt, which is how double entry book keeping is done.  The US government took on that debt.
The demand for US Treasuries is not because the Fed is the largest buyer, it is because sovereign nations around the world buy that debt with a voracious appetite.  They do so because they feel the US will always honor it and most international transactions are done in US dollars.  So long as these two things remain facts, there will be healthy demand for US Treasuries.
And I have no idea how to respond to your "Moby Dick" comment.  That's a disconnected word salad, right there.
The quantitative easing by the Fed is not a problem because some banks made money from the transactions involved.  It is a problem because it is not reasonable to expect a small group of people to manage that kind of velocity in the monetary supply.  It's hubris, not corruption.  
We're fans of Bitcoin because it challenges the notion that there should be an overarching authority to manage our money - not simply because they'll steal it, but because it is too big of a job for any single authority to accomplish efficiently.

It feels the same from the holder of the deflationary currency's point of view, but it is not the same.
Whether it is deflationary or inflationary currency wouldn't make a difference in the definition of loan making.  But taking any currency and "stuffing it under the mattress" would not be moving the money (that is to say, the wealth that is described by that money) through time.  A deflationary currency still represents wealth, just an ever increasing amount of wealth over time, assuming it is the monetary system of an expanding economy (side note: bitcoin is not deflationary - it is just assumed to be deflationary as the world economy is expected to always expand).  That wealth is not moved from some point in time in your future.  Most importantly, the holder has no control over how much wealth is added (or removed) over time to the bitcoins under their mattress.  A loan provides an exact amount of wealth in the present, pulled through time from the loan taker's future.
Consider this though experiment: you have a little machine that makes wealth.  Let's say it is a machine that makes the chairs in my previous example.  The machine makes a chair once a month.  But the machine needs some repairs today, repairs equivalent to three chairs.  I can take the wealth to be generated for the next 3 months, move it in time to today, and transfer that wealth to the repairman today.  I do this by taking a loan.  Holding a deflationary currency doesn't help, as I can't wait for the deflationary currency in my pocket to represent enough wealth to exchange for repairs to the machine.
Whether the terms of the loan use an inflationary or deflationary currency is irrelevant to the fact that the loan contract moves the wealth through time.  It is only relevant in HOW the wealth is moved through time (that is to say, the terms of the loan contract), and how the wealth of the contract itself is generated (as a dollar today is worth more to you than a dollar tomorrow).  Don't forget that fact: the loan contract itself generates wealth as it is providing a service in exchange for risk.

They guy that accepted the 10,000 Bitcoins to arrange for two pizzas to be delivered ultimately sold them for $400. The pies cost him less than $25.
The guy that bought the two pies for 10,000 Bitcoins was a prolific miner. He was first to publish GPU miner code.  He pretty much spent all his coins early on.

I explain intrinsic value of Bitcoin as the ability or right to participate in a perfectly accurate and highly accessible accounting ledger.  It is no less tangible than holding a right to the full faith and credit of the government that regulates the most robust economy in the history of the world.  With this right, you enjoy the ability to quickly and perfectly transfer account balances with anyone, anywhere, without relying on a single entity.

This is a big problem, and I suspect the solution is somewhere with Smart Contracts.  So instead of alt coins, perhaps you'd use colored coins.
Edit: to better characterize the problem, the deflationary nature of bitcoin is the obstacle when it's value out paces the return on the investment.  In a traditional loan, if bitcoin's value increases say 5% per year vs. some benchmark asset, you'd need loans to return more than 5%, specifically a percentage at least as large as the opportunity cost of losing use of those coins for the period of the loan.

“Implementing policies” that were never needed in the first place is a bad thing. This “big picture” euphemism is a nice way of saying a select group of people will force what everyone else can do, in contradiction to their free choices.  The ones that win in that scenario are neither the consumer nor the business. 
The internet experience was fine before the net neutrality regime. Innovation and competition will ensure it will only get better.  Consider, as an example, what you can do over LTE today vs. what you were able to do with GPRS, the prevalent wireless data technology when Net Neutrality was first advocated.  You can watch HD movies on the go without your devices ever touching a cable brought to your house, yet “Internet To Your House” is a founding principle of calls for Net Neutrality.  Technology has outpaced the thinking of the select group of people. 
So the real “big picture” is to let businesses fight for your dollars because in the end EVERYONE benefits.

Each institution approaches compliance differently according to their circumstances.  Coinbase cannot behave the same way as a credit union in Des Moines because they are approached differently by regulators, as allowed by law. 
KYC is hard on financial institutions as it makes it more difficult to quantify risk than it was in the 90’s when the rules were fewer, more uniform and clearer.  This ephemeral profiling causes more frequent de-risking, to which apparently you fell victim. 
Coinbase has clear issues with customer support (they suck at it), but it seems they were at least clear with you.

Many of these drugs are cheaper overseas because we subsidize the cost with the prices set in the US as drug companies have to choose between selling drugs with reduced margins overseas due to foreign government price controls, or not selling the drugs there at all.  That is a foreign policy issue, not a pharma industry issue.  Additionally, as there is government regulation on the sale and pricing of some drugs in the US, companies have to make up the margin shortfall in both of these cases by pricing up other drugs in the US.
In this article's case, they can't seem to find symbicort for less than $300.  A quick Google search reveals you can pay around $200 cash, with a discount card, for symbicort by not using your insurance.

The profit margins of the larger pharmas are below expectations (generally, profit margins across all industries should average to be 15%).  The smaller *successful* pharmas that engage in riskier research have much higher margins.  This skews the numbers for the industry as a whole (something like 17%).  What the averages don't take in to account are the negative margins of those smaller companies that go bankrupt following failed lines.

Agreed: Krugman sees the value of American dollars as underpinned by the taxing authority of the government that demands remittance in American dollars.

So as there is no known commercial computer that could compete with the overwhelming hash power of all nodes today, we are safe from this scenario. 
Even if many arm themselves with a super computer, the protocol is designed to readjust the difficulty of mining to ensure blocks are mined every 10 minutes on average. 
However, theoretically a quantum computer can be designed to make mining trivial, so [trivial]( that the protocol wouldn’t be able to adjust difficulty to match. At that point, the integrity of Bitcoin would be in jeopardy. 
Fortunately such a quantum computer is about 15 years away and the groups are [already working]( on changes to adapt.

Good point about Gold - I was only looking at Bitcoin as currency, not a store of value.  That's a big miss.
Repos: repurchase agreements.  A significant portion of M2 are short term accounts, mostly associated with repos.  Repos are a way to get short term liquidity out of a financial instrument, such as a bond.  Business enter into the repo market to prop up their cash accounts for expenses (on one end - on the other it is to squeeze a little more return out of their cash reserve).  The effect on M2 is to create a "frothy" layer of money.  Since Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, (it is my humble opinion) these instruments will not be as in demand in an economy facilitated by Bitcoin, and thus the repo market will be nothing like it is today.

It’s not random. It is based on a specific algorithm. 
But you asked about chances of another wallet creating the same private key.  The numbers are too big to do as to be nearly the same as an impossible event. 
Imagine each **private key** as the size of a sugar cube (a 1 cm^3 sugar cube).  If all the private keys were arranged in a sphere, this sphere would encompass the local ~~group~~ Super Cluster of galaxies (well, not quite all of the ~~Local Group~~ Virgo Super Cluster, but you get the point).
Now of course we don’t use private keys. We use hashes of the associated public keys for addresses in the ledger.  If each hash were a sugar cube, the sphere if centered on the Sun would reach beyond ~~Neptune’s orbit~~ the Kuiper Belt. Much much smaller, but still formidable enough to consider collisions as near enough to impossible to be indistinguishable from impossible. 
EDIT: to put that further into perspective, if all of the addresses today with balances were arranged in a sphere, that sphere would fit on a typical suburban front lawn.

The problem with “the whole world,” is that except for Europe there is no economic equivalent. To squeeze another USA out of Africa, for instance, you’d need 3 Africas.  For China, you’d need all of China, not just 300 million Chinese.   For Japan you need two of them. 
So you need a shockingly unprecedented adoption of technology, economic development and currency to get to $1mm if your time horizon is less than 25 years.   Possible, but not likely. 
Believe me, kid, 25 years flies and progress will happen in unexpected ways. I’m still waiting for my flying car, but am pleasantly surprised with my smartphone.  I also wonder where my 4 day work week is.

Anything is possible, but a $1mm (in 2017 dollars) valuation is not likely before you retire. 
Putting this into perspective, there is around $1 trillion in USD in circulation, and about $9 trillion on deposit in US banks.  Let’s say every US citizen adopts Bitcoin, and lets ignore the rest of the world.   Let’s also assume 20% of all Bitcoin has been lost forever and all Bitcoin has been mined. 
$10 trillion / 16.8 million Bitcoins = $595,238. 
So getting to $1mm you need the equivalent of two USA’s to adopt Bitcoin as their everyday currency.  Possible, but not likely in the next 25 - 50 years.

I replied to another post with this:
*Imagine each private key as the size of a sugar cube (a 1 cm3 sugar cube). If all the private keys were arranged in a sphere, this sphere would encompass the local Super Cluster of galaxies (well, not quite all of the Virgo Super Cluster, but you get the point).*
*Now of course we don’t use private keys. We use hashes of the associated public keys for addresses in the ledger. If each hash were a sugar cube, the sphere if centered on the Sun would reach beyond the Kuiper Belt. Much much smaller, but still formidable enough to consider collisions as near enough to impossible to be indistinguishable from impossible.*
*To put that further into perspective, if all of the addresses today with balances were arranged in a sphere, that sphere would fit on a typical suburban front lawn.*

I’ve been in the business for decades. I’ve met few CTO’s I’d trust doing engineering work, let alone architecture work.  And that’s not their job. It’s even worse for CIO’s. It is tough to find someone who cares enough to keep their personal technical knowledge base relevant enough to create the right vision while possessing C-level business acumen and associated soft skills to steer an organization to the goals needed to realize that vision. 
CTO’s should be leaders first, managers second, businessmen third, infrastructure architects fourth and developers last. 
The most effective CTO’s are executive material leaders who know how to hire the right technical directors and get the best out of them without making then “yes men.”  Very tough to find.   
Too often you get CTO’s who are insecure managers who try to leverage their outdated knowledge in preening before their peers and direct reports.

Some advice I was once told (buy have yet to follow), is to keep a separate account at a bank with which you have NO other accounts and use that exclusively to pay your taxes.  That makes it more difficult to for the IRS to freeze/seize your regular accounts.

I watched the last episode last week. I would describe the series as an emotional roller coaster ride, if that coaster went straight down and ended completely vertically. 
It was one of the best god damn dramatic shows I ever watched.  Louis CK has talents beyond the comedic and this series bares witness to it: story, direction, cinematography (so basic, yet nuanced), and acting.  If the show doesn't win a shit load of awards, there is no justice in art.

To send Bitcoin from yourself to someone, you have to offer a transaction fee to the miners. The average fee right now is over $1 due to high demand and low available transaction bandwidth. 
So for you to buy $1 worth of bitcoins, the person you are buying from has to pay more than that in fees. It's not worth it.

I know one example: Adobe Photoshop.  For all of the (quality) effort that goes in to Gimp, there is nothing quite like Photoshop for professionals.  And it doesn't run natively on Linux, though technically it runs on Unix (OS X).
There's a lot of desktop software out there that is accepted (for better or worse) as de facto industry standards that have no equivalent in Linux.  You might be able to "get the job done" with FOSS, but the expectation in your profession may be that you know the proprietary tool that more often than not is Windows only.  Additionally, this drives what organizations support for the desktop, and often eliminates Linux as an option.
Full disclosure: I've used Unix and Unix-like operating systems since before Linux sprouted from Minix, and built my career around Unix.  I am a Unix bigot and can barely stand Windows but must use it.

I'm acutely aware of the world we live in.  Unlike many others, I have not forgotten the Red menace.  Red China is a powerful enemy.  We already fought one war with them to a draw.  We are in a long cold war with them now.
Snowden had an avenue to take to expose the federal government's abuse of our rights.  There are a ton of proven legal protections afforded to whistle blowers these days.  There are a ton of attorney's chomping at the bit to represent whistle blowers, and obviously, a media that is willing to ensure a fair hearing.  He could have shed light on these abuses without defecting to an enemy that also bitterly remembers the war we fought to a draw.

He disclosed our [activities against China]( on the day Obama met the PRC's new president and revealed how we were spying on, gasp, [Russian and Turkish diplomats](  These details have nothing to do with our 4th amendment rights.  These are things we EXPECT the NSA to be doing.  He's giving away state secrets of activities that do not harm our rights.  Had he contacted an attorney to be a whistleblower, he could have protected our state secrets.  Instead, he wants to be an adversary to his homeland.

I agree.  Buying shares in an ASIC based mining firm is very much like joining a mining pool: the goal of both is to aggregate risk.  I have trouble seeing what is so terrible about corporations taking over the mining effort.  At least the public firms will be forced to be entirely transparent in their management, and open to public investment.
The only downside I can see is that the hobbyist won't make a profit just from his/her garage creations without it being fundamentally novel and the seemingly "easy money" days are over.

That's the root of this controversy: is the government engaging in something that requires a warrant that specifically is tailored to each individual with the same thresholds applied to a garden variety search of their effects.  The government is claiming that it is not as a human being is not listening in on phone calls or actually reading emails.  The government claims that since they are merely using data analytics, that its thresholds for suspicion that allows this kind of activity are much smaller for the public in the aggregate.  They claim that only when their analytics point to specific suspicious activity, the normal thresholds apply to gain access to the content of the data for a human to review.

Precisely: here are three examples of NSA whistleblowers that didn't turn traitor.  Imagine if Snowden picked up the phone to talk to Drake, Binney or Wiebe.  Instead of being a defector, he'd have been just building on the work started by them, adding immensely to his credibility and theirs with his physical evidence.  Snowden would have received broad support politically instead of a turning away many who see him as a traitor.
And don't get me started on what he did to his girlfriend in all of this.  "Oh, hi honey, it's me.  We're breaking up.  It's not you, it's me.  I'm in Hong Kong hoping to start a new life under the protection of the People's Republic of China.  When the feds pick you up and harass you and your family for months on end, just be truthful.

Assuming you're in the US, you could open an account with Coinbase linked to a US bank account.  Then transfer the coins to your Coinbase wallet, and cash them in to your bank account, at a rate that maximizes their daily limits.  
Follow this with a 1040-ES filing and check to the IRS for long term capital gains, and a similar course of action with your state if applicable (due by January 15th, 2014) .  Record this event to include in your April filings.

I agree webwidejosh that it's not worth it to have an always offline machine just for paper wallets.
Offline using your everyday computer would be safe for all practical purposes.  Since it takes little effort to unplug yourself and boot from a USB and print a paper wallet, you might as well do that as opposed to using your everyday computer with the OS you use every day.  The risk compared to the effort of having a special offline computer just isn't there in my opinion.
Off topic, but it is my belief that just about all modern hardware has already been compromised by the Red Chinese, or more accurately, shipped from the factory ready to be compromised.  But right now I wouldn't worry about the Reds going after your Bitcoin wallet.  They're frying bigger fish (with the heads on, of course) with this exploit.

Gold has uses beyond currency. The US dollar has the backing of the most powerful government in history. For Krugman, this is easy to understand. 
The store of value in Bitcoin is the security of its open ledger. Krugman just doesn't see the value in that.  He's too high up in his ivory tower to see it. Any small business owner who has suffered to balance their books would quickly recognize the beauty in that secure open ledger.
