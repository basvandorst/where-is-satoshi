I'm sure we'll so lot of this as Bitcoin becomes more popular.
Get ready for articles suggesting gender pay gap in BTC or how Bitcoin isn't inclusive because they don't have any transgender developers lol (I actually don't know that but whatever)
As for electricity consumption, seems possible to say mining is quite expensive now. But as stated above this is not a death sentence and we could see innovations coming soon (I hope for the sake of profiting not just  "clean energy")
Also, I remember a news from one/two years ago that an Apple datacenter could single-handedly increase Ireland's power demand by almost 10%. Therefore it's not crazy if Bitcoin ever demands hundreds of TWh in my opinion.

Yes where? When you guys say it hit 19k you're talking about specific exchanges right. Like I know each exchange will have their own price vs demand dynamics.

I have spotted Venezuelans more than once in this very subreddit telling the same thing.
