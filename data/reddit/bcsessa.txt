Thanks for the clarification!

No, i know my setup and can tell it to you, I am just asking for startup money. I mentioned that the benefactor could have input just so that they could be a part of their money if they wanted to be.

Thanks! I have visited Duke and I have several friends that go there and it really seems like an amazing place!

It's insane what people do

I am involved with Botball robotics, which I enjoy better than first because it has fully autonomous robots. But that's just my opinion. I play guitar,but not as often as I probably should. I also speedcube, (see [r/cubers]( so I guess that is my quirky thing. Apparently it is very difficult to get in nowadays and grades aren't everything. Any other advice?
I feel as though summer research will help show my passion for physics, as will taking advanced classes, attending lecturers, etc. I have been networking at SMU and UTD (I live in Dallas). The only downside to it all is I am an affluent white male that attends a Christian private school (although I am an atheist). I'm the least diverse thing you can think of. I read somewhere 1 out of 5 Harvard students has family in the 500k+ income bracket (a statistic which I fit). Of course this isn't a automatic pass at all, but does it play any sort of factor?
If I don't get into MIT I really want to attend Duke, does that seem doable?

So I've heard. The best I can do is hope but not get too caught up in one school.

Work hard play hard. Hopefully I get accepted. I want to be a theoretical physicist but I also want to, you know, have fun and shit.

Never knew that about Bexley.
I aspire to attend MIT and go to East campus.I hope I'm not getting myself into anything that bad.

I am currently a sophomore. I am taking junior and senior level courses. I have a 3.8 unweighted, 4.4 weighted. I am doing research this summer in particle physics at a local university and hopefully I will have a paper to submit somewhere. I am also a team leader on an internationally award winning robotics team. And my ACT composite score is a 34 as a sophomore (perfect math and science). How likely is it that I get into MIT?

Haha thanks. I know there are a few rich bitcoiners out there, so I figured what not give it a shot. If you look at the block chain people are transferring 5-10 bitcoins like they are nothing.

MIT has a dorm on campus called Senior Haus that is and I quote "a crack home"... Even nerds need to get off

Granting the CoinCraft A1 is expensive, what about this...
yea...three-quarters of a million is a lot, but isn't that proof there is a profit to be made?
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:01:53
Great idea, but It would never work. Reddit is too widely used... Bitcointalk.org is somewhat better
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:19:18
Sounds a bit like a scam...website? xD
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:46:24
How expensive is it to do that? Where can you learn how?
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:51:12
But if I bought a beefy asic worth a lot of money and one that could say do 1+ th/s, wouldn't that be better and also keep me competitive with everyone else?

Can't you use the hardware for other nonbitcoin currency? Or just sell it to someone?
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:38:02
why? can't you earn money with a miner though? You can make your ROI back in a week (or two) in most cases.
