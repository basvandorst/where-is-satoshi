Most certainly I think this majestic motherfucking art will go a long way in creating your desired look of Investors will bow down to the artist gods for decades to come, their minds awash with possibilities, fed slowly to them through the grace of magic internet money!

Oh, so that makes it okay.
Regardless of the illusion, he still had the intent to have people murdered.
He also sold incredibly dangerous drugs, and regardless of your interpretation or what you want the laws to say, they were extremely illegal.  He went to jail for that.
If you can't go to jail for being a drug kingpin and ordering hits on people, what is jail for?

Waving your hand won't make the problem go away.  Bitcoin _will not survive_ if people refuse to answer important questions about it because they might not like the answers.

What?  Everyone on was adamant that he should *not* be allowed to talk about his 'scam' or w/e (I'm not involved), and now that he isn't, you are still angry?  
Wow.  If there's one thing (amongst the others) turning me off bitcoin, it's seeing the forums and this community.  You guys are hostile and delusional as fuck.
