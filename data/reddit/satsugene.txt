Ugh. I feel like so many problems would be non issues if people followed the simple rule of “Do not speak about someone who is not present, and if someone is present, let them speak for themselves.”

...or in your case, at all. That makes no sense.
There are thousands of points of concern between a user and the network, particularly on a consumer PC running Windows.
That said, a language flaw in C# or the .NET framework that leads directly to decryption and malicious transactions are extremely low on that list of common risks. It would become apparent in many higher visibility applications if the problems were occurring in such a widely used (and abused) codebase.
On a per-application basis, it is far more likely that a given developer mishandled keys, wrote overly verbose logs, used functions beyond their intended purpose, implemented features that users use in an insecure manner, relied on insecure network connections, etc., compared to the risk of there being a flaw that makes all applications using the stock crypto library, or all managed applications inherently unsafe.
All of those very common issues could just as easily exist in any poorly written application written in C (or Java, assembly, or whatever) running on Linux, or in a well written application with a poorly configured or vulnerable OS (or network) or insecure user behaviors.

That bread would be a great with a soft cheese. Nice prawns too.
