I don’t know that. BCH/BTC May win the war, maybe it’s LTC, or some other version of crypto. Bitcoin has marketing on its side at the moment and that’s its only real advantage over the others.
Just out of curiosity - Did you buy the card with bitcoin? What were your fees? How long did the confirmation take?
Right now I see very real issues but only hear about some promising solutions.

Isn’t that what most people are trying to accomplish on this sub

It’s not just Coinbase. This is a huge problem for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:10:30
Prices always vary by exchange. GDAX isn’t always the highest.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:15:13
I appreciate the positivity but don’t you see this as a fundamental problem with bitcoin? It hasn’t scaled well and the backlog is a tremendous issue. The utility it was built for is horrendously slow and expensive as adoption increases. So what is it exactly that attracts value to the currency?

When will we stop hearing “they are working on it”?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:03:12
Yeah it’s odd - but you are locked in at the price. I just got some of my coins delivered today.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:33:14
Yeah but that’s after a massive increase. Don’t get me wrong I love the tech, but the valuation is a bit suspect.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:05:13
For every short there is a long? That’s not how it works.

I looked at the emails they just take 7-10 days
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:34:12
I don’t own any and trade on GDAX :/
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:21:01
I wouldn’t call any of them a scam coin. As it stands today, bitcoin has almost no use outside of its marketed value. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:21:18
I’ve seen posts with high fees to Newegg purchases. But this is all second hand so I’ll take it all with a grain of salt.

I’m not even going to watch.
Shorting is how You are essentially borrowing an existing asset and betting it will go down with the obligation of paying back the asset. So let’s use bitcoin. You’ve had a bitcoin for 3 years and it’s worth $10,000 now (easy math), I borrow said bitcoin betting it will go down and sell it. Price goes to $7500, I buy a bitcoin and give the asset back. I made $2500.
The only long position is after the price goes down/up. If the price goes up and you have to pay back, you lose money.
So thinking they cancel one another out is not the way to go because the price will have already moved one way or the other. 
Do I know how this will effect bitcoin? I don’t. But I doubt this will help your rocket to the moon.
Edited: I was being mean I’m sorry. I’ll go get caffeine now.

Ethereum has one thing going for it. Usefulness. But like any other crypto you can’t predict the value and shouldn’t really use BTC as a benchmark. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:38:43
I like how it’s one or the other to you. Until the LN fairytale becomes reality (and maybe not even then, who knows for sure what the next big thing is) BTC value is pure marketing and no utility. Until this changes, BTC runs a serious risk of devaluing substantially.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:31:39
All good points. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:09:51
That’s also a pretty flimsy argument for its value. There’s no use in a “store of value” when the value fluctuates so wildly.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:46:09
That’s fine. I made money too. I’m just telling you, right now, it’s near useless. The marketing push with continue to make its only use trading for greater amounts of fiat. If that’s your biggest goal for BTC and crypto then you’ve lost sight of the intention of bitcoin and crypto.
That’s the danger.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:21:46
Ok, I see what you’re saying. But I would think that it would still require a tangible purpose. The perception now is “bitcoin is a cutting edge digital currency” once that changes on a large scale, BTC could be in trouble.
Essentially, the store of value relies heavily on its marketed purpose which is not actually very useful.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:54:39
I’m with you. I hope bitcoin figures it out especially the fork with BCH which currently is superior as a currency. I don’t know how to reconcile that though. 
Again bitcoin (BTC) has the name brand and marketing. But what purpose does it serve as a currency?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:12:14
Just out of curiosity, how could it possibly be a store of value? Unless I’m missing something, without utility it’s vapor. But I could be missing something and that’s why I ask the question.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:43:22
That’s a pain in the ass. I assumed it’s because I’m new to Coinbase, is that the case?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:23:05
I was having frames run off screen and all sorts of issues.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:34:09
My main problem is that GDAX isn't suitable for Mobile.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:10:46
Is GDAX more responsive? I’m definitely using this going forward, but I’m curious.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:35:08
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:23:55
Coinbase malfunction?
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:21:20
It seems the app doesn’t update as frequently as the website
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:23:54
Does it take you a week to finally confirm the purchase? Mine's been pending for days. I just want to transfer it out and start using GDAX or some other exchange and get other coins.
