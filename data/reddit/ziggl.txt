I have to admire people who really do invest and take risks on something like this to better their lot in life.  I'm not interested in playing the market and getting more stressed, I just want to participate and have a chance at lucking out.
But then I realize that, in order to eventually have a $ return on your bitcoins, you'd have to watch the market value.  To me, that means I should also do intelligent research and engage in some light speculation.  Unfortunately, for me that also means that I would never be satisfied with my research and would obsess over everything until I eventually make a bad decision (and even if it's the best decision at the time, I'll eventually regret it if a better decision comes along at some point) and quit everything.
I wish I was a hard worker, or that I was just dumber.  If I could work hard I wouldn't miss so many opportunities, if I were dumber I wouldn't see how many opportunities I've missed =/

If having more money would only enable you to gain more possessions, then you're already in a pretty good place in life.
I'm single and I get by, but I could never support a family with any of my current career possibilities.  I guess what's helped me calm down here is that I still probably couldn't support a family even if I had been up on bitcoins since day 1.
