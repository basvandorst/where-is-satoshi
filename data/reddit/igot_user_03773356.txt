I'm also having problems with fiat withdrawals. Have had about USD20K pending since 45 days back. Had posted a thread in BitcoinTalk about this almost a month back:

Another false promise by Rick Day as usual. This time, on claims that the wire transfer has been sent. Funds were never received and Rick refuses to provide proof of transfer.

    Rick, show me proof that the wire has been sent on your end. You were so enthusiastic about showing proof of payment when I first transacted with Igot. Without proof, the conclusion is that you're plain lying and are trying to divert responsibility to the bank.

I had already reported Rick and Igot to the relevant Australian authority in this matter - Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network (ACORN). Am hoping they are actively pursuing this matter.

I feel your pain, thangapandi. Rick again promised last Thursday that the wire transfer had been sent and I've not seen a cent!
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:10:33
Releasing another correspondence in early July with Dan and Rick promising to return me my money. NOT A SINGLE CENT HAS BEEN RETURNED SINCE THEN!












We hope to have this resolved soon.

It's not so simple - I dealt with them solely because I could get a higher price for selling my BTCs. They paid me back for a few transactions, but failed to do so when I traded larger amounts. Rick is running Igot as a confidence scam.

There are loads of victims. You can sight similar comments on reddit, bitcointalk and on igot's twitter and facebook pages. 
If you're lucky, you can still sight the wall of complaints on their facebook page, before they again get scrubbed by igot:

Rick is running Igot as a confidence scam. Believe me - I did do the usual "trickle" transaction test to verify that I could withdraw smaller cash amounts.

 Rick Day (chief conman), most recently promised to pay me all of USD16K that igot owes me by 10 August. As usual, this was a blatant lie and I have not received a single cent. I had already reported igot to the Australian authorities - ACORN and ASICS. 
Fyi, igot owes me the USD16K since 3 May - almost a 100 days ago! You can read about my experience here:

Am publicizing recent email correspondence between Rick and me showing that Rick is a shameless liar. It's been consistently like this since May 2015:

Good for you, thangapandi. But I wouldnt thank them if I were you. They didn't do you a favor, and only caused you anguish.
@_date: 2015-08-12 13:51:41
No point waiting, dude. I have chased them constantly for more than 100 days now. Just do whatever it takes to get your money back. Rick is a crook and Dan is just his puppet.
@_date: 2015-08-12 00:16:12
Dan is part of their elaborate scam. He's there to give a public impression that Igot is addressing people's concerns. But this is all a false front. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 15:15:07
I did report to ACORN a couple of weeks back. Here's their reply:
"your report will be evaluated to establish if this is a criminal offence or a legitimate business that unfortunately is or has gone insolvent.
If it is a criminal offence, your report will be allocated for investigation."
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:18:38
Lucky you... I'm still waiting for mine. How much did Igot owe you?
@_date: 2015-09-05 16:28:26
You probably did not consider that the reason why you got paid is because Rick/Igot is paying you using someone else's money! That's why the others who commented in this thread are saying you are naive.
@_date: 2015-09-10 14:58:19
 I absolutely understand what you are going through. I had created a thread on this exact same experience:
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:23:16
 I'm very surprised that you can still praise Igot even though that scam of a site owed you money for so long. You are encouraging bad behaviour from Rick and his gang of cheats. Most folks would remain outraged even if they received their money back.
