So now imagine you found arbitrage oportunity and exchange hot wallet runs dry, beacuse there are many ppl try to sell on arbitrage. Just dont use exchange account as wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:39:44
You are using same protocol as Testflight app, right ?
@_date: 2014-04-17 10:34:21

@_date: 2014-04-09 13:36:37
Even if they go down you still have privkeys.
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:11:08

@_date: 2014-06-12 21:58:21

@_date: 2014-04-20 16:45:56
DDoS ?
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:50:34
I think that last reports of gox logins from chinese IPs was infact manual indexing ;)
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:12:17
Are you from future, wizard?
@_date: 2014-01-11 15:58:19
You should update:
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:45:40
keep in mind they have no fees unlike bitstmap/btc-e
@_date: 2014-05-05 11:05:54
Get Versocard and install Verso wallet. You can even get it running without ordering card.
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:21:20

@_date: 2014-01-20 18:54:38
Bitsafe is not standalone device. Bitsafe and trezor works in same way.
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:38:10
I dont see that filter option in app.
@_date: 2014-02-15 16:22:01
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:11:50
Hard fork with block reward halving would cause "death spiral"
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:23:07
wallet address and signed message as proof
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:47:25
Not possible, lowest was 615$

@_date: 2014-05-25 21:41:08

@_date: 2014-04-07 09:00:23

@_date: 2014-04-30 08:16:49
Electrum for OSX. VersoCard for iOS
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:48:24

Telling your friends that you became wealthy by accident is not a good idea.
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:11:54
why contacting them via ?
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:22:50

@_date: 2014-04-24 14:03:48
i want to know that too
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:35:33
Something like "lock wallet" could be done instead. So you choose if you can withdraw to everyone or just lock to your wallet address.
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:39:07
mesh network still needs isp to have internet.
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:25:59
Dude its exchange, not wallet.
@_date: 2014-10-07 12:21:33

@_date: 2014-04-15 12:31:50
China FUD was market manipulation, demand is still there, we are going back on track.

Give him loaded paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-15 23:36:11
You just import ur private key into blockchain wallet. Keep in mind that only sending change to NEW cold wallet will make it secure again.
@_date: 2015-01-05 14:01:39
Each new deposit = new address. Think.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:07:33
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:25:35

@_date: 2017-03-18 17:04:52
I think you misunderstood my message. I wish this post to get on frontpage, instead its being downvoted or ignored.
@_date: 2017-03-10 11:26:12
and start "my transaction cost increased" shitstorm 
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:50:34


still not 2-3MB
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:18:42


How is BU fork altcoin, and PoW fork not ? 
You seriously believe what u wrote or you are just paid troll ?
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:34:02


Wont BU HF continue current blockchain ? its hypocrisy
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:37:00


Told u, this community is biased.
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:58:25
Its reasonable, but I think you will get downvoted or deleted.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:13:57
Technically, 2.1 is also in 2-100 range.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:31:38




So will list BTC as altcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:50:05


Because it will create new altcoin. Just like BU HF.
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:10:53
in 2008 bitcoin didnt exist
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:55:04


and what if they dont ?
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:52:33
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:27:04


what is it then?
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:17:12


Yet they failed for at least a year. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:10:40
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:29:00


Full blocks are going to kill bitcoin. Whats worse? Also home nodes doesnt matter in decentralization, mining nodes matter.
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:58:29


Wasnt that HK agreement plan ? Which Core failed to deliver ?
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:11:16


is a bad idea why?
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:08:34
How you lost $3000 in a month, when just month ago price was about 450 ? Seems like weak hands
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:06:00
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:17:14
Theory: you sold and try to lower btc value by spreading propaganda.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:16:17
no, whale miners can afford to mine at loss
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:34:07


Please educate yourself, bitcoin is PoW and you need hashpower. If think you dont need it you chose wrong coin.
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:30:26
1987 or 0.1987 ?
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:23:19
Core scaling proposition failed. Judging by hashrate HF scaling is blocked by SW miners (not the other way around).
BTW I support segwit2x not BU nor UASF.
@_date: 2013-10-03 08:56:12
