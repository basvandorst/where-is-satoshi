I had a account frozen too, I eventually had to abandon it and make a new one, I had several 100 transactions.  I had to send in personal paperwork to prove it was me and they never unfroze it.

Its actually still too high.  I've been burned enough with stocks to have been able to spot the warning signs when everyone was bullish at 1200.  Hedge funds bought into this much lower and can easily manipulate huge up and down swings like they do in the market.  Investors who get burned in stocks have the same mindset that there is unlimited upside, and there is no way this thing can drop this much, its fool proof!  There is always some variable the mass doesn't expect that can tank this thing at any given time.  I've been in the same position with stocks that seemed full proof, and I lost 50% in one day and still seemed confident it was a simple road block.  The next thing I know I'm down 95% because I thought I would be able to make all my money back instead of cutting my loses.  I'm not saying not to invest in this, but be highly cautious not investing anything other than what you can lose.  
tl;dr take profits along the way and don't get greedy

You should be worried, you are down 50% in one of the most volatile investments out there.
