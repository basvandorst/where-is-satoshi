Ok, I'll go ahead and set up an Electrum then.
Thanks again!

Thanks for the quick response!
Who's running Multibit then? I actually got decent support from them last month, so I'm surprised to hear that.
I've /just/ transferred some coin to the Multibit HD.
I'll have a look at Electrum though. Is there a way to transfer the balance from one to the other without having to send the coin through the blockchain?
Is RBF a clear choice to select and set up? And just to clarify - it means that I can choose a low fee, and if it doesn't move, the wallet will cancel the first transaction and put in a new one, with a higher fee instead?
Thanks again!

Thanks for responding - I was just being anxious - the second transaction has now showed up and been confirmed too.
I wouldn't do it again, I just happened to paste the same address without realising it changes automatically (unlike in Multybit, which I was using till now).

Thanks for the more detailed explanation!
I think moving from Multibit (classic!) to Electrum is a game changer, and the fact that you can change the fee even after the transaction is basically all the assurance I needed (and I don't need to do too much, if any, calculations at all!) - I've just been getting SO frustrated with waiting days for coin to move..
Thant link is also quite handy too, but yeah, I won't take the info on there as fact, at least not the timing.
Thanks again for taking the time to help!

Thank you too for responding.
That link has some interesting info, especially considering one of my own transaction (from Multibit, so can't change it) is stuck in the &gt;12 bracket.. :/
And yeah, the Electrum wallet has some really good options, so I'm really glad I took the advice here and switched.

Just came back to say I'm pretty impressed with Electrum so far. While a transaction I made on Multybit yesterday morning still hasn't got a single confirmation, the one I made tonight has already gone through, and with the minimum fee, too.
Not sure why I waited so long to upgrade!
Edit: One more quick question - I may have somehow used the same receiving address for two separate transactions. When I search the blockchain, I only find one of them. Have I accidentally sent my coin in to the void, or will this self correct?
Thanks!
