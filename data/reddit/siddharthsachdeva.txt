��nice one
But wisdom is not just about age
@_date: 2018-08-05 20:23:57
Haven't you seen these kind of posts.
They are kinda famous in here��
@_date: 2018-08-05 19:33:50
�� I do ignore them but when they just came right in front of me, I have to give them a slap
@_date: 2018-08-05 20:23:01
Did I said that I was giving Wisdom on my last post.
What I was doing was just warning about losing money. 
That's it
@_date: 2018-08-05 20:19:51
I think the "Childish" word explains everything
@_date: 2018-08-05 10:24:59
That looks literally impossible because of futures trading.
But anything can happen after 5k 
@_date: 2018-08-05 20:37:41
Here are they.........So finally it breaks 7k and I have been warning you all that it will touch 5k or may even break it but nobody trusted me and actually started criticizing me that I'm arrogant or whatever.
Ever since future got listed on the exchange market is behaving like stocks and we are following the technical analysis I believe it has to touch 5k 
 I am just trying to save your hard earned money and the main proof is that I haven't asked a single penny for my advice so hold your cash in your pocket till bitcoin prices touch 5k and for more details you can check out the video on YouTube (by YoctGeo that bitcoin will go below 5k) 
Good luck you all for your future investment
@_date: 2018-08-05 20:33:24
And the other thing that I heard most " this is going to moon".
Nobody can tell when will it shot up.
Right now we only can say that if bitcoin crossed 12000 then we can hope for next bull run.
Until then keep your money safe in USDT.
And actually I have noticed the drop in usdt market cap which implies that either people are becoming bullish again on cryptocurrencies or they are converting in fiat again
@_date: 2018-08-05 21:06:55
Thank you ������
@_date: 2018-08-05 19:42:09
I think you're telling us about yourself
But "am I right" is interesting thing
Really liked it
@_date: 2018-08-05 19:32:05
So true
@_date: 2019-02-24 02:02:34
 We were already on the roller coaster, it's just we were moving downwards and now we're going to the mooooooonnnn.
Everyone enjoy the  ride.

No I am not acussing anyone, but the thing is if you investing you do for profits and if don't want the profits that's called charity and then you can forget about your money. 
And if you can see that right now bitcoin (hahaha) is also at 4k maybe that is sign from the destiny that repeat the history and become lucky once again. 
P.S. I'm not advising you to sell that's entirely your call.  Infact I want bitcoin to make new highs
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:07:26
But you have lost your gains and I'm literally shocked that you haven't booked your profits yet.
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:59:25
So you are saying that at 400 somebody would have thought 20k and if it's about target than I don't think you wanted to become a billionaire by just investing in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:19:10
Here ''Donating" means throwing away your money as if you have plenty of it and you don't care
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:09:51
We can only wish
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:20:48
Fingers crossed
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:30:26
Check out my youtube channel YoctGeo.
And you will get to know
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:09:12
Me too really want bitcoin to touch new highs 
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:55:44
400k buwahahahaha .
Don't worry I'm also dreaming for million
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:33:53
So! Who is rushing for this sale ��
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:09:41
Most probably true.
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:05:50
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:13:50
That is just an assumption and which we were doing for 10k too.
But I wish that bitcoin touchs 1 million, yet it's nothing more than dream
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:29:21
This post is for those who bought the peak but I think those who are at still in profits can afford one of them but for how long nobody knows and maybe bitcoin touches new high. Anything is possible but as a investor you should book partial profits and stay in the bitcoin game, on the other hand if it doesn't matter that your invested money stays or you Loss then don't even bother to book partial profits because than I believe you'll never be able to book profits even if bitcoin goes a million.
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:32:43
 Otherwise it will go to 1k
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:15:51
Your reply is suggesting that you're donating money to bitcoin. 
I have invested for some return and alot of people others too not like you and you know what telling bitcoin is the future, might be true but on the other hand it's also the way to pump it up
@_date: 2018-07-13 01:26:43
��������just read books as much as possible
@_date: 2018-07-27 16:10:41
Oooohh very lengthy comment but you know what this is gonna happen (the 5000 thing) so just wait and watch and a better advice is that stay away from the market right now, take your money out of it.
Best of luck
You little crypto shit
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:29:14
Good one��.
But actually there are several in my contact��
@_date: 2018-07-23 06:51:27
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:42:33
Actually nobody is because a lot of people now knew that and that is because of my videos just check out and then talk
@_date: 2018-07-13 01:09:29
 Just wait and watch
And actually that is my channel ������
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:59:18
Hey I'm not saying that it can't change our monetary system it is just about investment purpose.
If want to know about changing monetary system then you must see the last video of this channel
@_date: 2018-07-13 07:05:36
So you're a augur fan
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:18:38
Warren Buffett started investing at the age of 13 I think, but a younger kid is now richer than him Mark Zuckerberg.��
So never underestimate anyone by their age just think about how much time somebody would have invested to do a particular thing.
P.S. You must feel lucky that you're chatting with future Billionaire
@_date: 2018-07-27 17:32:19
Time will give you the answers 
Good luck 
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:49:18
Everyone is expert or nobody is, because this is a New space and after couple of decades we're going to find out the right type of analysis and that will still be evolving.
I mean think about stock market, we have so many ways to analyse something, yet we still try hard to find another one which can yield better results.
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:02:17
It can be true as there is no hard rule for it but as you have seen the video there is no support before 5000 and that is actually a strong one but if that breaks the market will completely free fall and we'll have to wait for more positive news for it's rebound until than it will just speculate around 4000 to 7000, but one can earn by trading
@_date: 2018-07-13 07:17:20
I don't know why people just can't see the whole picture, when I said speculate between 4000 - 7000 it means 4000 is support and 7000 is resistance psychological and you should see the video for little bit detailed information and listen talks about how people are thinking right now about the market so don't assume any other thing
@_date: 2018-07-27 17:08:21
Sorry forgot to put the sugar syrup on it but next time I'll do it definitely ����
Truth is always bitter but better
@_date: 2018-07-23 06:50:54
Bull run will do that
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:39:13
You did get me wrong, I'm not telling here that what I am doing, I'm a analyst and that is my job to analyse everything that I'm interested in and you need the proof, that you'll see in few days when it will go 5k or for better understanding why don't you just watch the video
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:48:51
I know there are other assets too like Gold and Silver, but once bitcoin touches 10k we can see a serious rally from there again and that will be the time we can expect it to be 100k
