Forget the 50k, you're not ready to invest that much and will panic sell during a big drop. If this is something you're truly interested in, you need to learn everything about it... you need to understand the technology and it's future. I believe you have to fall in love with Bitcoin in order to weather the storms. You also have to understand that this is experimental tech, no returns can be guaranteed or expected. 
Go down youtube holes, read the bitcoin whitepaper and slowly make buys as you understand the importance of what bitcoin is trying to do.
