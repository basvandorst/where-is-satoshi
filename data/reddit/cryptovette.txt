The price of BTC / and alts will be kept low until wall street has bought what they want. It always works that way. Big money never loses. They have a plan to suppress price and its' working. In the meantime, we can take advantage of that. 30 years of wall street experience tells me that's the way it will go

I did not have the choice to buy extra speed. I purchased on coinbase and transferred to Bittrex. Blockcypher is giving me the stats. Now at 37 minutes with 3 confirmations. I cannot imagine standing at a retail store waiting for these confirmations before my crypto card is approved or my transaction goes through. This is a real world issue.

30 minutes and only 1 confirmation - 6 needed. BTC will never be used for transactional purposes unless this changes. Stellar takes me 5 seconds and I have confirmation. This is not a lie. Just try it. Go ahead and vote me down but it is the truth. BTC MUST improve speed of confirmations. I do not know the answer how to get there but I know this to be true. If it can be used real world the price will increase as applications increase.

Big money wants in. The articles are all over the internet. Andreessen opens new crypto venture fund, etc... But, Wall street will not come in until the price is right. I feel they will orchestrate a huge final drop and it will happen during July. They can't wait to get in, but as usual, the fix must be in to make money for "them". I expect a big second leg washout is on the horizon. My background is as a financial advisor and mortgage banker for 20 years. I know how they work. I left the industry to do social service work because it was so corrupt. That's why I expect this to get even more ugly in the next 30 days. I am sorry, but I really feel convinced this is what we will see.

It's a trap. Watch out IMHO
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:36:16
It may actually be dropping because institutions are planning to buy in. For a while I did not believe that but now I am more convinced than ever. At some point, the bleeding will stop and Bitcoin will regain much of its glory and may surpass old levels. I see that many have it pegged going down into the 4,000's before it rises - if so I wish it would hurry up - this is like pulling out a sliver under the fingernail oh so slowly!

Volume too low to break out. Watching patiently.

Something is up with BANCOR. Its vol has 10 to 100X on many cryptos. It is throwing everything for a loop. I wonder if it was hacked. Just look at the top 50 cryptos right now \- most all are BANCOR exchanged . Does anyone else see this.....

"Avoid all alt coins" I do not understand that line of thinking.

As a former FA, the companies try to protect themselves from recommending investments they are afraid of/ have no knowledge of / or consider risky. Very few Investment firms will allow their FA's to recommend penny stocks (trading under $5.00) unless special exceptions are made. As a result, they can miss it big time - as in BTC!

Back to the 4800's then back up!

You are going to be mad at me - but my gut tells me they are not done. Real capitulation is despair - people running for exits - everyone claiming the market is destroyed. Thats when the whales restack positions and we ride up very quickly. We are not there yet. My guess is a test lower than the one we did earlier this month. No Rhyme or reason - just to shake us from our foundations.

According to Investopedia: What is 'Capitulation'
Capitulation is when investors give up any previous gains in stock prices by selling equities, to get out of the market. Capitulation involves extremely high volume and sharp declines. It also usually involves panic selling. The term is a derived from a military term which refers to surrender.
BREAKING DOWN 'Capitulation'
After capitulation selling, many traders think there are bargain buying opportunities. The belief is that everyone who wants to sell a stock for any reason, including forced selling due to margin calls, has already sold. The price should then, theoretically, reverse or bounce off the lows. In other words, some investors believe that capitulation is the sign of a bottom.
Investors can only identify capitulations after they have occurred. While traders often attempt to anticipate capitulation selling or buying, the reality is that capitulations are outcomes that result from the maximum psychological and financial pain that can be endured by investors before liquidating their positions. (To learn more, see: Profiting From Panic Selling.)
Using Technical Analysis to Identify Capitulations
Capitulations often signal major turning points in the price action of underlying securities and financial instruments. Technical analysts can visually identify capitulation using candlestick charts. Hammer candles often form at the end of a selling frenzy when the lowest price is made, as capitulation sets in and signals a price bottom followed by a reversal bounce on heavy volume. Traders who wanted to sell their positions have done so as panic reached a climax. As fear starts to subside, greed may set in and reverse prices.

I sold ETH yesterday on Coinbase. It said funds would be in my acct by this Saturday - they showed up today! That was a good transaction. What problems are you having?

Capitulation - We are no way near there yet, and I believe thats where we are headed before they stop the games
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:22:13
nope - much lower unfortunately

Only about 8% of Americans own Crypto as of March 2018 according to CNBC. I do not know what the percentage of ownership is for the rest of the world? However, I would say we are all considered "first to the party".
