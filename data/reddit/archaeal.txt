You're posting an extremely vague question on a website called reddit.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:31:23
The value you speak of that is based on perception (or in other words, trust that someone else values it similarly), is actually **extrinsic** value.  I believe that Bitcoin has both intrinsic and extrinsic value.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:45:32
What do you mean by "mining efforts"?
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:55:09
Segwit transactions have a discounted fee, thus clients will tend to prefer them in order to pay a lower fee for a similarly-sized transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:16:21
I think you posted to the wrong sub.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:48:25
Slightly better I suppose?  I mean it's just so inefficient electrically...
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:46:29
Because not many transactions are using segwit yet.  Also, the mempool is still pretty large.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:33:43
Doesn't matter if they are running those nodes.  Core node will function just fine.
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:05:51
Segwit active?  No, not for another ~2 weeks.
Segwit locked-in?  No, but we just passed the lock-in threshold.  It won't actually lock-in until tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:53:17
Depends on the price growth rate...  With a high enough rate you'd never accumulate 1 BTC, even with infinite time.  In other words, yes, there exist infinite series that sum to less than 1.

I thought I saw BCH had some blocks around 3 or 4 MB...no?
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:52:53
And the reason two different mining nodes won't have the same parameters (i.e. the whole block header) is mostly because their coinbase transactions differ (will be paying to different addresses).  
For miners in the same pool, the pool supplies each miner with different "extraNonce" values to work on, so as to keep them hashing differently despite having the same coinbase transaction and even if trying the same nonces.
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:07:48
That address doesn't have any transactions on either Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash.  You didn't successfully send anything to that address (nor has anyone ever).
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:58:46
No, you're incorrect.  The network doesn't decline transactions because two different people are using the same address.  From the network's perspective, it doesn't matter who broadcast the transaction.  It only matters that the transaction is signed and otherwise valid.  Two different people could send valid transactions from the same address, assuming they had signed it with a valid private key.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:36:10
I'm not sure what you are proposing the HF would be...to instantly lower difficulty so as to avoid waiting out a long diff period?
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:40:00
Tehcnically, the obvious assumed risk is faster growth of the blockchain size on disk.  Whether that's an important risk or not is up for debate.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:51:55
Sure it can.  The bitcoin software doesn't care if an address has already been used.  The probability of generating a new address that someone has already been using is so extremely close to zero that it's practically impossible.
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:35:37
It works like this.  For instance, if a large sell order is entered, this often entices other impatient sellers to re-enter their orders at a lower price, below the large sell order (aka "sell wall").  This in turn lowers the market price, and a trader like Spoofy would wait until enough sell orders were entered at prices below his, cancel his sell order, and then buy up all those other orders.  In this way, the sell order was meant to lower the price so they could buy a little cheaper.

Hmm I'd be a bit more careful than that.  Check the cash for counterfeit.  In fact, tell the other party ahead of time that you'll be checking for counterfeit...I've successfully avoided a few bad trades this way.  Also, you can ask the other party to wait with you for at least one confirmation on the blockchain (usually 10 minutes or so).  Honest sellers probably won't mind too much.

This, 100x.

It's surprising that your Electrum isn't showing this transaction...or is it?  I'd suggest you contact Electrum support or ask the users on their subreddit for further help.

Once it's signed, broadcast, propagated, validated, without any 51% or other attack against it, and the network is not being overloaded with transactions, and a sufficient percentage of mining power is including your tx in their candidate blocks...yes, it will almost certainly eventually be confirmed.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:24:27

@_date: 2017-08-10 03:52:46
And yes, there are ways that malware could overwrite an address, for instance altering the clipboard.  Not sure if that's what happened but it's a possibility.  If your Electrum isn't showing the tx, I would highly suspect that either the program is compromised/faulty, or the tx was never actually saved/sent.
Have you asked the buyer at what address he sees his received BTC payment from you?
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:49:01
Not literally zero, but practically zero.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:47:29
A little back-of-the-envelope math shows that this would hold true if Bitcoin maintains roughly an 8.1% price gain every month (154.6% per year).
@_date: 2017-08-10 05:53:55
Maybe just wait a bit longer?  What's the tx hash?  Check what the fees are.  It's not uncommon for confirmations to take hours if fees are low and/or the network is under heavy load.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:49:27
In general, I think waiting out one long diff adjustment period is far preferable to a HF.

I'm not sure I agree that saying "the mempool" vs "the mempools" leads to **tremendous** confusion on the bitcoin subreddit...that seems a bit hyperbolic.
 Sure, maybe some occasional confusion among the less informed.  I suppose we could all start saying "the mempool**s**" and "the blockchain**s**" and "the UTXO set**s**", etc.  I just don't think that plural form is all that important in reducing confusion about bitcoin.  There are enough places to learn what we mean by mempool.

I'm not familiar with greenaddress.  In general, a mnemonic is sufficient, assuming that the wallet you're using is indeed that sort of wallet (i.e. it says something at setup time to that effect).  Furthermore, you can be confident of your backup/restore procedures simply by doing a practice run or two (with a separate wallet/mnemonic ideally containing only a small amount of coins).  Try resetting/wiping/deleting that "test" wallet and then try restoring from just the mnemonic seed.

Nonces are just tried incrementally...some mining software might start at zero, and some might pick a random starting spot.  It is ideal for the mining software to not keep picking random nonces, as they could then be retrying the same nonces multiple times.  This is why mining software increments the nonce for each "guess".
The reason separate mining nodes don't collide with the same hash for the same nonce value (for instance, two miners both guessing nonce=0) is because their candidate block's header has different data.  The merkleRoot is always different, and the timestamp typically varies every few seconds and can differ between miners.
The reason the merkleRoot is always different, even for the same set of non-coinbase transactions, is because the coinbase transaction is paying to a different address for different mining nodes.  So, even if two mining nodes have the exact same set of non-coinbase transactions constructed in a candidate block in the exact same merkle tree order, they can each try nonce=0 and get totally different hashes, because at the very least their coinbase transactions are different (and thus their merkleRoots differ, and thus the candidate block header differs).

Hehe yes, pretty much.

Sure, people are used to with waiting 3-5 business days for various financial transactions using the legacy systems.  Waiting only 100 minutes is still preferable.  Although, if 90% of mining left bitcoin for another coin, Bitcoin would effectively be in the process of dying.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:53:26
Yes, because at the very least the coinbase transaction will be paying to a different address.
@_date: 2017-08-10 05:18:05
Miners can choose which transactions to include in their blocks, maliciously or not.  Generally all valid low fee transactions make it into blocks because all it takes is one honest miner/pool to solve a block with the transaction in it, assuming some 51% attack is not also rejecting blocks containing that transaction.

2. I don't know, I don't know what wallet you're running or what you're trying to do.  Maybe read the docs on your wallet or contact support or their user community.

Higher fees paid, in general, will mean your transaction getting included in a block faster.  Many wallet apps allow you to specify the fee either directly or at preset levels.  If you are going to just be storing, then fees won't matter at all.
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:22:40
The reason some miners jump from mining bitcoin to mining something else is often because they can make more profit mining something else, in terms of bitcoin or dollars or other fiat currency.  For older or less efficient mining hardware, it almost never makes financial sense to mine Bitcoin...instead you would make more bitcoin/dollars by mining ethereum, for instance, and quickly converting your mining rewards to bitcoins or dollars, or whatever your preferred currency is.
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:42:54
Bitcoin's blockchain is protected from all sorts of attacks by having mining be a very computationally expensive task.  Greatly simplifying the cost and complexity of mining blocks would reduce security and break down those protections.  I'm not exactly sure what you're envisioning with "a preexisting mechanism".  If you mean some central node or set of nodes that automatically mine at a capped speed...then you're simply limiting the amount of security that Bitcoin has and centralizing the network.  It is to the network's great advantage to have as much mining power as possible spread across as many independent miners as possible, as this makes many kinds of attacks prohibitively expensive.
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:07:56
That means 50+ blocks have been mined since your transaction was included in a block.

The mempool is the pool of unconfirmed transactions.  This pool exists in every node's memory (RAM), and is in constant flux.  New transactions are added to a node's mempool when they are received from peer nodes, and they are removed from the mempool when the node receives a new valid block containing them.
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:25:18
I'm not sure what you mean in your original comment then...  The difficulty drops to meet the hashrate but you want to see it drop further to match the total hash power?  They are the same thing.  Am I misunderstanding you somehow else?
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:31:48
That's a public address...  If your wallet software doesn't allow you to see the transaction details, then I have to assume it's either broken, not-so-fully-featured, or the transaction actually didn't get broadcast to the network.  Is it possible that the buyer is confused as to what he received?  Do you have his BTC address that you attempted to send to?

The vast majority of governments already allow it, and some have even declared it to be legal currency (i.e. Japan).  Of course, they can always change their minds, but the difficulty in enforcing laws prohibiting bitcoin use could prove to be similar to that of enforcing laws against narcotics.  In other words, a waste of money and time.  Still, it's conceivable that some governments could make it not worth the trouble of using bitcoin.  Luckily, most governments allow you to emigrate!

No, that's pretty unlikely.  It's not like a stock split, where the price is literally cut in half.  This fork is the creation of a new, different asset.  It just happens to be bootstrapping itself off the existing bitcoin blockchain, so some history is shared.  If the value drops, it will be organic market forces, and not something mathematically caused by the fork.

Yes I understand limits but I'm also a software engineer that has read the bitcoin code, have you?  The block reward as defined the software is an integer amount of satoshis.  This integer gets divided by 2 via a right bit shift roughly every 4 years. Thus, once the reward is one satoshi, the next halving takes it to zero.  In fact, the code explicity sets it to zero after 64 halvings, to avoid undefined behavior of right-shifting more than the bit width of the integer.

EDIT: I missed that you asked about wire transfers...the bank has no requirement to report these.  However, the IRS can see any wire transfers happening in the US banking system, so it's likely that large wires will raise some red flags and investigation.  More likely is that the BTC exchanges could soon be required to report significant trading activity to the IRS.

1.  Make sure your router is forwarding the port properly.
2.  Make sure your Bitcoin core is running with -daemon flag.
3.  Make sure you're checking your actual public-facing ip on the binodes site, with the proper port.  In my experience it sometimes doesn't work for my node's ipv6 address, so I usually check my ipv4 (or my node's .onion address).

It depends on where you buy.  On most exchanges, the trades themselves are off-chain (not on the blockchain), their users' balances and transactions are managed in a private database.  However, deposits and withdrawals are on the blockchain, moving to/from wallets.
Buy and sell orders get continually matched up based on the exchange's code, typically the earliest orders that are at the same price get paired and executed for whatever amount of coins they have in common.  It's more complicated than that, but that should give you some idea.

The OP?
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:28:17
The difficulty percentage change is calculated by looking at the amount of time spent mining the blocks since the last retarget (same as the bitcoin code, except for this small off-by-one error mentioned in this post).  Then it compares that amount of time to the *expected* amount of time for those blocks (10 minutes/block, as you mentioned).
So, for example, if we've mined 100 blocks in 1300 minutes (expected to be 1000 minutes), that means we're mining at a 76.9% pace (1000/1300), and thus we would expect difficulty to decrease by 23.1%.  This uses the whole period's blocks mined thus far to extrapolate an estimated time for the rest of the period.
Whether the current 2.8% changes purely depends on how much faster/slower the remaining blocks get mined.  If it continues at the same average pace it has been at for this period, then it will remain at 2.8%.
I'm not sure what you're asking regarding historical data and reasons miners left 10 days ago (though, not that much, it's apparently just a few percent, and that could be partially due to mining luck).
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:59:53
Yes, I'm quite familiar with the code, having worked on altcoins forked from the bitcoin repo.  I thought you were saying that forks happen based on something you saw in the source...your second sentence was rather confusing.  Maybe I misunderstood you?
Fun fact:  there's actually no variable in the code that limits the supply to 21 million (that may have been fake code in the documentary).  The 21m limit actually follows organically from the reward halving schedule built into the code.  There is a MAX_MONEY constant defined as 2.1 quadrillion (21m bitcoin represented as satoshis), but this isn't actually limiting the supply, it's used for other things like checking transaction validity (can't send more than 21m).
EDIT: I'm bad at spelling

With layer 2 tech like lightning, we could easily see several orders of magnitude increase in transaction throughput and fee reduction.  Bitcoin as it is now, yes, it's more useful in large settlements, but that's just due to the current fee situation and tx throughput limits.

I suppose your best bet is to contact Mycelium support
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:38:30
That's the estimate based on the current block rate, since a lot of hashpower has moved over to BCH recently.  However, BCH difficulty will go up in like 12 hours or so, which should bring miners back to BTC, so 19 days is probably too long of an estimate.
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:22:15
Wow, there is so much wrong on that page, I don't know where to start.
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:09:20
Hmm that's odd... Maybe there was a problem connecting to the external api...  I'm in the process of having it actually connect to one of my nodes for faster response.
"Expected" just means that that particular block should have been mined by now, and "unexpected" is the opposite. It's a visual way of showing what the targeted normal pace (10 mins per block) is. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:35:34
But gaming the diff and yoyo-ing with 10 minute moving average of 144 block BCH retarget times smooths out both chains considerably...  It won't be like it currently is, where one chain suffers for days.  If miners jump on BCH, the diff will jump at the next block, and they'll jump on BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:18:25

Yeah, transacting on-chain has been relatively expensive (compared to bitcoin of old) for a while now.  It's not very practical for small amounts, but for large payments, it's quite cheap.  Once things like Lightning network become more available, transacting small amounts of bitcoin very fast very cheaply will likely become the norm again.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:40:45
Interesting idea...  I guess the main problem is that faces change over time, sometimes quite drastically (surgery, accidents, etc).
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:01:11
Yep, that's probably just the time their node received it.  Each block does have a timestamp embedded, but these are not always perfect, as the protocol allows some wiggle room there.
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:48:52
Not sure what your block info source is, but looking at blockchain.info, there were only two blocks at about the same time (483016 and 483017).  It's not that unusual to see this.
The difficulty will adjust at block 483840 (in around 5.5 days).
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:17:44
You can also watch Johoe's mempool chart live, to see how block mining is progressing towards including transactions around your tx's fee rate.  Your tx would be somewhere in the uppermost purple-colored band that represents tx's with 100-120 sat/byte fees: 
 
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:07:00
Well, 70 blocks (roughly 11.7 hours) is currently the upper limit estimated by  but that's just an estimate.  We can't predict how the mempool will change in the coming hours (a function of new transactions being broadcast and the block mining rates).  In the last 12 hours, my node's mempool has increased in size by roughly 50-60%, which explains why your tx is taking a while to get confirmed.
EDIT: latest estimate is now 70 blocks
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:18:43
The mempools are quite backed up at the moment, hence higher fees for now.
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:50:45
Buy from a friend, perhaps?  Almost any online service is going to charge fees of some sort (price markup or percentage based fee).
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:01:13
The common opposition is that increasing the block size limit will double the growth rate of blockchain size on disk, causing more expense in running a full node, and thus possibly decreasing the crucial decentralization of the node network.  Furthermore, with segwit already live on the Bitcoin network, there are scaling solution possibilities that don't hinder decentralization in this way.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:26:41
Yes, it's definitely getting better, but nowhere near perfect.  I guess I'm not sure I'd trust it enough to transact money reliably...  If I scanned someone's face and the software translated that to the wrong pubkey, and then I pressed send...uh oh...  I think it would be better to build tools that are more fail-safe and don't require manual checking of pubkeys.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:36:23
I assumed his idea was that a wallet app and associated service would associate your pubkeys with your "face" keys.  In this way you could receive coins from someone by them simply scanning your face in their wallet app.
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:00:12
I use either GDAX or Gemini, both are exchanges with relatively low fees.  There may be better ones out there.  I'm not sure what coinbase's network fee is at the moment, or whether it allows you to specify your own fee...
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:48:42
Your transaction has a fee rate of 101.229 sat/B, which should cause it to get included in a block sometime within about 65 blocks from the time it was broadcast.  Results may vary.

@_date: 2017-10-27 18:12:56
So anytime someone wants to pay me by scanning my face, I first need to access my private key to trigger a rescan and new pubkey?  Hmm, yeah I dunno, that seems wonky.  But an interesting idea nonetheless.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:48:58
Miners are unanimously "signaling" for segwit, but we are in a difficulty period that has already failed the threshold for segwit lock-in.  So, the current signaling has to be taken with a grain of salt.  In about 12 hours, the signaling actually begins to matter.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:33:17
It's an upgrade that fixes transaction malleability, and provides for smaller transactions, effectively increasing the transaction throughput (effective block size).  There's plenty of articles all about it.
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:18:37
Right but looking at node counts now it's pretty clear that most are Core nodes.  Which is why I've been pushing for people to run UASF nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:39:08
Sure, I agree it's non-newsworthy in general and isn't really worth people's time except for perhaps dumping it for BTC.  I was merely trying to raise the point that having shared history with bitcoin's blockchain is something that ought to be included in describing what BCC is.  Clearly the launch of any random shitcoin doesn't directly concern bitcoin holders, beyond just being something new in the crypto space.  Whereas a coin that forks from bitcoin does concern bitcoin holders, if only because we'll have corresponding BCC because of it.  That's really all I was getting at.

@_date: 2017-07-27 11:07:57
Fire up those UASF nodes!  Miners could stop signaling segwit because most nodes aren't bip91/bip148 enforcing.  The more of these nodes the bigger risk they would take in not signaling.
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:32:03
Its much more concrete than merely sending a message...  it actually rejects non-signaling blocks.

@_date: 2017-07-24 21:38:05
You seem to not comprehend English very well.  I never said non-mining nodes create blocks or build the chain, I simply said that they can refuse to propagate invalid blocks, which has a direct effect on what the consensus becomes as far as what is the longest valid chain.
Anyways, there's no point in further discussion.  You can't understand what I'm saying.

Ah, bummer.  Consider instead running the latest UASF version of Core:
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:04:34
Yes you are correct.  Since there are 5 upcoming signaling  periods the chances are much greater.  Perhaps I'll edit my post to show that data as well.

They'd probably try to hard fork away from the hostile miners.  It could end up being a game of cat and mouse as the hostile miners could then start mining that chain.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:34:18
Yeah, it's possible, but seems very unlikely to me.  The possibility assumes that some already uber-wealthy person or group wants to destroy a relatively tiny thing like Bitcoin.  If they are that wealthy, it's hard to imagine them really caring about a system that is worth a mere ~42 billion dollars and processes only a few transactions per second.  Not only wanting to destroy it, but wanting to spend a ton of money in doing so.  Should the bitcoin network continue to grow a ton, in the future, it becomes even more expensive to attack.  Most likely prohibitively expensive.
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:46:27

First, I'm very sorry that this happened, it's never fun to be scammed.  I hope you find a way to get your bitcoin back.
But what's important here is to identify the problem without emotion clouding things.  As far as I can tell, the problem here is a scammer on EBay and paypal's willingness to take their side.  You could have sold an expensive TV on EBay, buyer receives it but says he didn't, then issues a chargeback...and you'd likely be in the exact same situation.  It really has nothing to do with the fact that it was bitcoin being sold.

Running a UASF node, you would indeed be on the side of the UASF.

I believe Slush allows the individual miners to choose their signal.
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:04:45
Yep, agreed.  The only way to get to that critical threshold is to run a UASF node, hence my urging users to.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:37:15
Have you restarted your node lately?  That ought to get rid of the message.  Also, consider upgrading to the UASF-Segwit:1.0 version.
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:31:31
As others have said, it's probably best to just buy BTC.
With that said, you should also mine if you want to, as this increases decentralization and helps secure the network, even if just a little.  Best of luck!
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:20:49
The UASF version will ignore blocks not signaling for segwit activation.  This helps ensure that come August 1st, the miners can't pull any shenanigans.

How can we know that most nodes aren't running bip91 or bip148?  Because the vast majority of nodes are Core nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:05:57
To say it is opposite in every way is pretty hyperbolic.  There are differences and similarities.  But ultimately, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are something quite novel and we should take care when comparing it to other existing instruments.
Now to your question...how much should/could Bitcoin be worth?  This depends on a multitude of factors, of course.  How will people use Bitcoin?  Will it be used primarily as money?  As a store of value?  As a hedge against capital controls?  As a ledger for timestamping data/titles/etc?  Thus far, it's been a mix.  How many people will use it?  How much fiat will flow into Bitcoin?  What services will be built on top of Bitcoin?  It's akin to the early days of the world wide web...so many gears turning that it's very hard to tell where things will land.
But, if we just consider the singular use case of Bitcoin as money...  It's pretty obvious that Bitcoin could see a massive price increase if even a modest portion of the world begins to use Bitcoin to transact value.  This use case possibility (and similarly the capital control hedge / store of value use cases) is why you see estimates from tens of thousands to millions of dollars per bitcoin in the future.

The scaling debate for BTC will go on even if BCC forks.  I believe the vast majority of users will continue to use BTC.  If adoption increases, BTC will run up against the block size limit again, even with SegWit activated.  We will always need to think about scaling to some degree.

I think it's pretty clear by now that the BIP9 95% threshold stifles the network's ability to reach consensus.
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:15:56
Yeah, that's the choice...  Some people want segwit without the 2x and I suppose that's what they'd do.  Others that want both certainly ought to run BIP91 nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:42:52
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:13:23
Not quite yet.  19 more BIP91 blocks needed.
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:00:49
Not quite...  This code causes all non-segwit-signaling blocks to be rejected (once this period is over).
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:00:58
Miners do start calculating PoW right away once a new block is received.  They don't have to wait for more transactions to arrive or anything like that.  The incentive to include transactions in a block is the optional fee associated with each transaction.  The more fee paying transactions a miner includes in their block, the more they earn.  
Also, when a new block arrives, while the miner's node is validating it, you often see that miner mine on an empty block because while the previous one is being validated they can't yet be sure which transactions in the mempool are still valid.  This allows them to not waste any hashpower during those validations.

@_date: 2017-07-27 12:31:42

TL;DR - in general, people that want to gain bitcoin don't want to destroy bitcoin itself in the process of getting it.
Yes, 51% attacks are a real threat.  One of the obvious deterrents is that mass double spending or other 51% attacks may effectively kill the golden goose, so to speak.  In other words, if you 51% attack in order to steal a ton of bitcoins or double spend, you will most likely cause bitcoin to crash in value, destroying most of the value of what you stole in the first place.  And in the meantime, all that hashpower would have been far better used to simply mine bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:10:26
Yes, either lightning or block size increase or both.  But just as importantly, SegWit fixes transaction malleability.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:33:28
A bitcoin mining USB?  Any mining software essentially uses SHA-256 to try to solve/mine blocks by listening to the bitcoin network (nodes) for blocks and transactions, constructing a candidate block, and hashing it's header until it finds a hash value lower than the difficulty target.
TL;DR - it has hardware/software that can do lots of SHA-256 calculations, and some other bitcoin-related functions that allow it to construct blocks, talk to the network, etc.
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:05:24
Nodes can refuse to propagate invalid blocks or transactions.  If there weren't full nodes to validate blocks, the miners for instance could decide to unilaterally increase their block rewards.  Without non-mining independent full nodes, all the SPV nodes would just blindly go along with it.

@_date: 2017-07-26 02:39:37
Right, because BIP91 only activated a few days ago, there wasn't enough time in this difficulty period to lock-in segwit (they just started signaling).  Next period it will reach the lock-in threshold, ASSUMING miners stick to their signaling.  UASF nodes arguably forced miners to signal for BIP91 and thus segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:53:31

Not just mining, but all transactions from those mined coins.  All transactions.  Do you not see how that is different from a premine?  Who will the initial BCC balances be unfair to?

How are you defining a hard fork vs a copy?
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:39:24
The UASF node actually ignores non-signaling blocks.  This means the node doesn't put them into it's chain.  Enough nodes doing that and the miners will be forced to signal or their blocks won't be valid.
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:44:50
If all of the user nodes ignore those blocks, then those wallets don't consider those blocks to have ever happened.  The miners would essentially be mining on an invalid chain that isn't accepted by the users.  Miners wouldn't be able to claim their block rewards.  This is why full validating nodes are essential to the network.  I think that's about all I have to say, I've wasted enough time trying to get you to understand but alas, no one is perfect.
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:44:31
If a majority somehow start running UASF nodes, miners not signaling will have their blocks ignored.  It wouldn't matter that they aren't running bip91 nodes, the effect now during segwit signaling is the same.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:49:33
Bitcoin Cash is planning to be a fork of Bitcoin.  This means it will be a separate coin that works mostly like bitcoin (but with an increase to the block size to 8 MB), and it will start out having the same blockchain "history" as bitcoin from the time of the fork backwards. 
 This means that if you hold bitcoin now, once BCC forks, you'll also hold the same amount of Bitcoin Cash in the same addresses.  However, once it forks, future blocks will be different from bitcoin's.  
There are things to be careful about during forks (for instance, read about replay attacks).
I hope that helps!  Plenty of articles out there describing it better than I can, but that's a high level overview.

Yeah...all bitcoin holders pre fork will have a correspondimg amount of bcc post fork.   That's quite different from a premine.  A premine is when a coin gets mined by a small set of people before anyone else is allowed to mine.  You can effectively mine bcc now by just mining bitcoin.  Thus, very different from a premine.
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:36:43
If you can, everyone, please run a UASF node to help make sure the miners stay true to their signaling.  They are signaling segwit now but could change their minds once this new period starts in a few hours.  More UASF nodes means more pressure to keep signaling.
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:49:53
It's highly likely, but not 100% certain.
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:33:56
Premined?  No.  Once BCC forks from bitcoin, the BCC coins will have been mined exactly to the same addresses as their corresponding bitcoins were.  Maybe you're not understanding what a fork is?
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:52:45
Less than 95% of miners signal bit 1.

Are you able to see/generate new "receive" addresses on your Ledger Nano S?  You simply need a receive address on your wallet, and go to Gemini and withdraw your coins to that address.

If you called Donald Trump a mushroom, and I disagreed about that, would that mean I'm fine with all his policies and actions?
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:17:35
Yeah, instead I'll just use the current block time average.  Maybe I'll give the chances for various block time averages.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:22:22
How's that?
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:36:36
After 12 hours, a new diff period starts, which means the nodes start counting blocks signaling segwit to see if it locks in during the period (needs at least 1916 blocks in the period of 2016 blocks).  
Will the price rise?  Maybe so.  Maybe not.
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:52:00
Without any full nodes that aren't run by miners/pools, who would keep a check against those nodes altering the rules in the mining pools' favor?  There is an important balance here in the various types of participants being able to fully validate that the rules are being adhered to.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:28:59
Now is the most important time to join UASF!  Especially since it takes days to sync the blockchain and Aug 1 is approaching fast!
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:21:43
And yes, if you're solely out to destroy bitcoin, that's one way to probably do it.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:38:39
Segwit has not yet been activated.  That would happen in a little over 4 weeks assuming the 95% signaling threshold is met during the next difficulty period.
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:07:19
Perhaps create a new paper wallet in a more secure way, and transfer your coins there?
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:35:58
I mean, do your own research, but I would advise your safest bet is to run the UASF client.  I and many others currently do!
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:21:44
Well, to be accurate...it isn't just an altcoin with Bitcoin in its name...  It is a fork of bitcoin and as such will contain bitcoin's blockchain from the fork point going back to the genesis block.  To say it is exactly the same as dogecoin is a bit disingenuous.

coin.dance is indeed a great site, but their BIP91 visualization remains pretty poor.

Here's the latest BIP 148 UASF release of Bitcoin Core (based on v0.14.2).  Starting Tue 01 Aug 2017 00:00:00 UTC, this node will begin rejecting any blocks not signalling for SegWit activation (bit 1).  The node will continue rejecting such blocks until SegWit either locks in, activates, or we pass Wed 15 Nov 2017 00:00:00 UTC.
@_date: 2017-07-23 07:13:57
Assuming you mean bitcoin addresses and not wallets per se, then yes, all of the bitcoin addresses existed from the start (they're just numbers anyhow).  The important thing is that there are a really, really, ridiculously large number of them.  2^160 to be exact.
And in actual wallet software, your second point is pretty much how many of them work, "creating" public/private key pairs as needed.
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:52:59
Hehe, sorry...  Had to log in to work for a bit.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:31:41
I prefer the most effective one in preventing the miners from fucking up the segwit activation.
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:11:21
Mycelium for in-my-pocket use, and Trezor for cold storage.
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:32:20
Reject, ignore, call it what you want.  Full nodes validate blocks and refuse to propagate invalid ones.  This is reason invalid blocks just don't get into the longest valid chain: they don't get propagated by honest nodes.  Without honest full nodes, the system is even more ripe for attacks from centralized miners.  It's just asinine to suggest otherwise.
This is very important in the bitcoin network.  There are all kinds of valid reasons a user might want to run their own full node, which you seem to just be ignoring.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:12:21
I hope you're running the UASF version there!
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:09:49
Hehe wouldn't that be fun...
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:15:09
Or there were much smaller blocks back then.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:46:16
Yeah, I think the issue is that the bit 4 signaling blocks were triggering that message a few days back during the BIP91 periods, and the message just sticks around.
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:39:56
Well, not a certainty, but yeah, close.
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:34:36
Of course it can.  Full nodes receive and transmit blocks to other nodes, as long as they pass validation.
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:06:05
I'm not talking about BIP91 signaling, I'm talking about BIP141 signaling.  And what's to stop them from signaling after August 1st if only a small minority of nodes are enforcing BIP141 signaling (through either BIP91 or BIP148 clients)?  There currently aren't enough nodes of those types to actually reject non-BIP141-signaling blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:51:17
Didn't we just both say that if the vast majority of nodes run UASF/BIP148, then non-signaling blocks get rejected?  I think we agree there, no?
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:06:24
Depends on what timeframe you look at...  Over the last 24 hours, it's something like 65% just based on blocks mined.
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:58:53
How about a volume-weighted average across exchanges like bitcoinaverage.com?
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:03:09
Well wouldn't that be something.  It's too early in the morning for me to do the Poisson calculations for this, but after coffee I probably will.

Ha!  Ok, well $25 is probably fine, then.  ;-)
And kudos for you to investing at a young-ish age.  Personally if I could go back to my teen years, I'd invest WAY more than I did, and with more diversity.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:04:48
Yes, those are certainly important details.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:14:34
EDIT:  sorry, misread your post.  I somehow read it as "We are guaranteed lock in..."
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:23:48
If there were a large majority of nodes running UASF, the network would effectively be rejecting non-signaling blocks.   So if miners stopped signaling for any reason (like the one you mentioned, lack of support in the nodes), they would get their blocks rejected.  Thus, very unlikely that miners would do this and miss out on their block rewards.  The 2x part is months off and they know that.  The here and now of signaling and block rejection is what matters at the moment.  Users can run UASF now and later run BIP91 if they choose.
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:36:33
EDIT:  I've added this.  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:25:13
Only starting Aug 1st though...your blockchain sync won't be any faster.
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:21:13
Yes, the miners can attempt all kinds of attacks.  But the reason they can't get away with doing that is that the existing full nodes will reject those blocks.
Yes, my full node running v0.14.2 UASF-Segwit:1.0 (yes, it's also a wallet) currently rejects such blocks, should it receive them from the network.
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:04:24
I think the main problem with this idea is that you're essentially acting as a trusted third party between the donator and the non-profit, custodially holding coins for them for some reason.  Perhaps a better idea would be to provide guidance for such non-profits on how to set up a wallet and directly accept bitcoin donations.

A:  The search button remains exactly where it was.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:44:39
The reason we sometimes see empty blocks mined quickly is because during the short time that a pool is validating a newly received block from the network, they mine an empty block so as not to waste any hashrate.  This is why empty blocks are typically seen very soon after another block.
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:51:33
Agreed on both points.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:01:54
This is a larger topic.  But essentially it removes several attack vectors as well as paves the way for things like the Lightning network.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:16:53
I've added these numbers.  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:27:04
If their hashrate actually had spiked, then it wasn't as improbable.  It all depends on that.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:28:54
Isn't an empty block just as difficult to find PoW for as a non-empty block?  Sure maybe you gain a tiny edge in block propagation speed...
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:06:12
Something like 130% more on average.  However there are many other important benefits to segwit than just transaction throughput.
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:18:23
I'd agree with that.
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:24:34
Only you can decide if spending a little on fees for a test transaction is worth the peace of mind when it comes to transferring a larger amount.  This isn't absolutely necessary considering you're using fairly tried-and-tested wallet/exchange, but isn't a bad idea. 
 I don't know if Gemini allows you to choose your transaction fee, but if so you could send one with low or zero fees (with the downside of possible longer confirmation times).
Your paper wallet could potentially be compromised if created on a compromised computer.  There could be a software or hardware keylogger, there could be malware that intercepted the paper wallet's private key, etc.  Always best to generate paper wallets on a computer that has never been and never will be connected to the internet or any untrusted network.  Lots of people do this with a bootable linux USB stick that doesn't persist anything on disk.  It's also important, if using a printer, to use a wired one that doesn't store the printed documents in its memory.
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:06:35
I don't use either Ledger or Gemini, but that all sounds correct.  I would check with your wallet manufacturer's guide to be certain.
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:04:04
It's a decent, readily-available-across-coins indicator of the market's general sentiment...decent enough for this site which was more meant to be entertainment than anything else.
I've thought about eventually making a composite index of several metrics like market cap, transaction volume, mining power, etc...and then allow the user to switch between views of the composite index and the individual components.  I guess I've seen some attempts at that for Bitcoin but only a few going across coins (a la coingecko.com).  But yeah, I'll probably focus more on the entertaining aspect of this site if I'm honest.

Larger blocks allow more transactions in them.  More transactions means more fees paid to the miners.
