Your opinions are your opinions. But chargebacks protect consumers from fraud and are one of the main value propositions of companies like visa and american express.

Absolutely- no chargebacks is not a selling point, don't know how this became dogma.

Is there any data on the amount of those transactions that are "tipping"? Bitcoin isn't usable for many things right now i'll bet you the tipping trend has had an impact. 
This is kind of unrelated,I read a story the other day in the paper about brazillians and their spending habits. Brazil had crazy inflation in the early 90's, it became accepted knowledge that the money you have should be spent right away, before prices go up. I think bitcoin has a similar problem. What people do with their money is determined by its usable value. Most people using bitcoin today expect the price to rise. Its  subliminally speculative.

Gold has a long history of value, intrinsic or not. Admitting the inherent worthlessness of bitcoin isn't going to encourage adoption.

To be honest, I'm not an expert and don't want to  embarrass myself with an attempted explanation, but I've definitely read a couple things that have lead me to believe that its very possible, all speculative and hypothetical of course.

...What you just named are services provided by banks. Generally, services fill a need that people are willing to pay for, what some would call a value added proposition. Ever try to borrow money? It takes a lot of infrastructure and people to facilitate the flow of capital and not lose money in the process.

The bitcoin protocol is extremely wasteful of computing power. At present, cost per transaction is around 150 usd, mostly in electricity. This is hidden, as it is given as a reward to the miner. It has the effect of devaluing bitcoin as a whole. Additionally, as the rate of creation decreases mining will become unprofitable and transaction fees will become the norm.

For sure, but thats also what makes banks secure. Everything is easily traceable and logged so that when problems do occur its obvious where the money went and who did it.

I understand the theory, and concede that their is value for some use cases in bitcoin. Money laundering, online gambling, and drug sales are great examples of Bitcoin creating value. As an alternative to the status quo, Bitcoin makes sense. As a mainstream solution, Bitcoin in its current form is inherently wasteful and impractical.

Do you honestly believe you have any idea what you're talking about?
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:36:06
The value that both banks and bitcoin create is through the service they provide to the market. To simply transfer money, bitcoin is inarguably inefficient. Its use requires the consumption of electricity, which has a sunk cost absorbed by its users. It remains to be seen weather the advantages of the bitcoin protocol could trigger the creation of value through use cases like the unbanked which you mention, but its a significant barrier to overcome. Banks conduct the transaction of money itself essentially for free. Banks have costs of course, but also provide a much greater range of services than bitcoin. Branches, tellers, account managers, and trucks all provide distinct services which create legitimate value and carry much greater economic impact than bitcoin's electricity consumption.

Its a broken window fallacy. Its waste.
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:32:04
You don't understand the fallacy. Its a question of measuring the creation of value to society and differentiating it from needless waste. Electricity is a consumable resource whose use in the production of bitcoin creates little economic growth. Compared with other methods of money transfer, bitcoin is extremely wasteful for little benefit. Contrast it with the developed infrastructure of a bank that has employees, real estate, and tangible assets and you'll see that banks create much more value.
