Bad idea. Wait for a concensus.

No. Relax and Stop thinking that way. Both can exist and take different paths. Bitcoin is the first crypto currency. Noone can take its position. Bitcoin is a big system and it will take more time to make decisions.

Where does it say that?

You are less worried about bitcoin failing and more worried about litecoin succeeding.. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:11:54
Bitcoin doesn't need his investment. LOL
@_date: 2017-06-10 08:54:39
OMG. I did not think that way.. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 04:18:20
Why not. Convert to litecoin and transact. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:39:47
This is make or break situation for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:47:57
Why can't be there a scenario when bitcoin will be used for big transactions and litecoin for smaller ones? 
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:56:27
It's Litecoin time. Hedge some with litecoin also.

Nothing will happen. People will wait for more time for BIP148

I agree. But I think, this time after initial down trend, it will eventually reverse the trend because of segwit. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:09:28
Can you please explain?

If anything wrong happens trying do too much to bitcoin then, not just bitcoin, the whole crypto world will crash with it. Central banks win. With this high valuation, bitcoin can't do mistakes... So, please don't talk about dividing bitcoin. Try to see what will bring a concensus with all stakeholders... 
No matter what, there should be one version of bitcoin.

Why?  Do you think Bitcoin should be only existing crypto currency in the world?
