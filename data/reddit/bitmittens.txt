Call it the "cashout value", how much money one would get after subtracting initial investments and taxes.

Can you add a feature you subtract 15% of the USD value for coins held less than a year and another percentage for over a year holds? The 15% is for tax purposes
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:47:23
For the low low premium fee of 25%

I had a similar situation. My account was locked as your account is now, then 2 days later out of thin air it was unlocked again. Hope you get what you already own.

What if I've in the past have hooked up my hardware wallet to parity.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:40:42
How do I know if I am affected?

Because the user willingly gives them the bitcoins under the assumptions that the user will be able to trade or sele  them.

What about trezor?

What wallet?

Coinbase is not a bank.

A global bank, HSBC  has been laundering dirty money and facilitating the financing of terrorist and organized crime. They've been fined already. [source](
That being said I think bitcoin would be easier as long as you don't intend to convert it into fit.

Do you keep any currency online or always store it offline?

@_date: 2017-09-15 16:58:53
I am not bashing them, I just want to make sure I can trust them with all my BTC
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:48:30
what wallet would you recommend?
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:30:36
What good is that if they can get away with it.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:02:35
What about keepkey?
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:44:26
You can call them a "bank", but there are not governed under the same laws as "real" banks, i.e. BoA, Chase, etc.

Did you sell for fiat and then  buy btc or straight sold for btc?
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:16:48
Are the fees good?
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:09:19
Bittrex will require you to provide the same info as coinbase. If coinbase doesn't work, I don't think Bittrex will work either.

Is GDAX a good site to store my money for a while?
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:51:22
congrats on the 150BTC. One day buying a single bitcoin will be absurd because of how high the price is.
