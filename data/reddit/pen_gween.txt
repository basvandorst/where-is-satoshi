as a sex worker that got cut several times by paypal and other banks and now uses crypto and helps other sex workers to open their BTC wallet - I approve
and fuck coinbase.
Tired that everybody loves jerking off to porn, but even when we pay 30% in taxes we can't find a way to get paid.
Thanks bitcoin for everything.

I am in Brazil - so maybe I could try setting up an account - thanks for this!

Thank you for these other options!

Thank you very much! - I thought so, I am still downloading their desktop wallet and its saying "1000 hours to update"  and I couldnt get an address yet - its a shitcoin just to start receiving it.

My fear is that, like their "privacy", they will track how you spend that money - so they will link your data with they already huge database (whatsapp, instagram, facebook) with more ads.
\- Oh I see you are spending your FBcoins in uber and coffee, here are some ads in your instagram about it :)
fuck that.

If i have my coins in a mobile wallet, in a phone always offline, without a chip - is it any different than a ledger and trezor?

In my case its mycelium, the one that is also recommended by bitcoin.org
Ive written my seed in a paper and stored in a safe place - if mycelium stops existing can I recover my btc somewhere else?

Whatever that facebook is in, I am out. - That "crypto" won't have 1% the freedom we have in BTC. Feels more like those coins we buy in videogames than whatever they are trying to push in.

That was me typing down my fanfiction back in high school from a boring day of class into [FF.net]( and realizing it was shorter than i expected.

I started using it when they gave me the option to get paid in BTC, so since them I started reading about and been trying to educate myself about it - and since the option to get paid was via an exchange, I never bothered with offline wallets, reason why I am asking now about it.

They also have no-nos about Sex Work in general. I get some payments in crypto for selling my videos/cam time in BTC and coinbase is a huge NO in our community. There are also reports of banks like Bank of america closing down accounts since FOSTA/SESTA got into action in the USA.
So don't try buying nudes with coinbase, guys.

Not using coinbase, since I do sex work (camming) - they are a no no in our community - but since its a smaller exchange and local (braziliex) and i was thinking today "what if this website suddenly vanished?!" I started to think about it. 
I started holding since last month after i got paid at 6200$ and it spiked, and holding since now - read more about BTC and not sure when I will sell, so probably going to put it into a offline wallet for a while and see what happens.
