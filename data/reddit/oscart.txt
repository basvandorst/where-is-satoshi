of course it does! Go and fork bitcoin already!
@_date: 2016-08-02 13:03:27
bahahah never saw that one
@_date: 2016-08-22 15:24:45
lol this conversation is getting so old. Security first my man.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:05:18
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:50:06
The SOLIDX offering is straight up insured so that could be a factor in which gets launched first
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:30:17
I think this is technically a 'bail in'
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:40:39
i guess you just need good cold storage then ;)
@_date: 2016-08-02 13:03:43
obvious joke
@_date: 2016-04-18 10:15:27
he should start a new coin
@_date: 2016-08-22 14:56:15
you do realise that blocks will inevitably become full
@_date: 2016-04-17 10:56:48
so on the protocol level all of the devs (and dare I say blockstream)
on the user facing side, the mainstream wallet companies - circle, xapo etc
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:29:07
in japanese, probably ;)
@_date: 2016-04-17 21:33:55

@_date: 2016-04-17 10:53:07
what exactly is this barrier to entry you keep talking about? 
@_date: 2016-04-18 10:12:26
the changes he is suggesting for bitcoin (even if they are a good idea) are so massive, they will never happen
@_date: 2016-04-26 14:24:58
pretty sure this is incorrect. The bill still needs to be passed through parliament
@_date: 2016-04-17 21:32:37
1. I do that pretty often
2. Regulation (e.g. Japan &amp; UK) will massively deepen orderbook liquidity
@_date: 2016-04-16 10:10:35
'what is the impact of bitcoin on the economy' is a pretty broad topic. try to narrow it down as possible. maybe choose a specific sector
source:I wrote my masters dissertation on bitcoin and the uk payments sector. Happy to send it for reference if you are interested
@_date: 2015-06-08 07:59:52
maybe he's neither ;)
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:10:30
normal people will feel alot better about using bitcoin if it is regulated
@_date: 2015-06-13 18:01:17
big 4 is a quite a widely used term, and there are lots banks that aren't HSBC or Chinese
@_date: 2015-06-14 18:49:28
sounds like he is :)
@_date: 2015-06-05 12:04:06
1. its not a wall street company, its a bitcoin startup called digital asset holdings
2. she's selling a product (asset tokenization on the bitcoin blockchain) to banks
3. they've been working on it for some time
4. they're not building their own chain
she's not saying the word bitcoin upfront because she understands that most people (especially in finance) switch off as soon as they hear the word. She's selling them on the benefits first, its alot easier to tell people the tokens are bitcoin after they understand all the benefits and potential uses
@_date: 2015-06-05 06:54:34
holy shit
@_date: 2015-06-13 11:05:55
nah it doesnt make sense. the guy is basically arguing that hodling makes it go down...

dude she understands bitcoin

Bitcoin trading platform
@_date: 2015-06-05 13:21:15
its similar to what nasdaq are doing with colored coins. Basically using bitcoins to represent financial assets - stocks, bonds, commodities, derivatives etc
@_date: 2015-06-01 08:03:11
should have been out yesterday no?
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:31:30
no but now you have it and wall street can move in and pump the price
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:03:40
they just dont want to admit they like bitcoin yet ;)
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:00:48
it only applies to businesses based in ny
@_date: 2015-06-05 06:56:40
i'm afraid you're mistaken. she runs digital asset holdings which is a bitcoin company. they're tokenizing assets on the bitcoin blockchain. She's not going around shouting bitcoin because she understands it hasnt got the best reputation at the moment and is getting people to understand slowly
@_date: 2015-06-13 12:14:11
you're an idiot
@_date: 2015-06-04 11:14:35
you know
@_date: 2015-06-04 11:15:36
they won't let it crash. they have enough money to buy all the coins. think about it, bitcoin market cap is only 3 and a bit Billion. its really quite small, especially when you consider that the majority of the coins are not for sale at any price...
@_date: 2015-06-01 08:03:11
should have been out yesterday no?
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:00:11
no they're business people. they understand the need to operate within the law
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:28:23
foreign btc businesses may choose not to take ny customers to save themselves some trouble, but ny law does not apply to places outside ny
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:18:10
yeah retail has been selling
@_date: 2015-06-05 06:57:51
nah she's using the bitcoin chain. The bitcoin chain has 100x more processing power than the whole of google. you can't use some shitty alt for what she's doing
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:49:46
what like bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-04 09:36:05
i meant regulation in a legal sense

can i request that you be able to add funds measured in different currencies? currently the only options are BTC and USD even though I've got my display currency set to GBP. Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:43:51
they're using colored coins

pretty sure he understands it well. He's been working on the reg for over a year &amp; taking submissions from everyone
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:58:29
we don't really have that information
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:39:54

don't really see this as much of a problem. if anything it's a good problem to have..

i take your point about DAOs, i had slock.it in an earlier draft but it got cut for length
@_date: 2015-05-07 11:47:38
but its not seen as a problem with bitcoin

@_date: 2016-03-27 19:58:10
I've been holding bitcoin since early 2013, and following this subreddit closely for the last few years
I'm not at all saying forget about the financial implications of the blockchain. I'm saying that it has a lot of other uses apart from finance which are interesting. Does that make me a heretic?
A lot of people don't care about finance. I'm talking to those people
@_date: 2016-03-27 14:44:52
i would argue that a blockchain does run itself. Obviously it is run by the users, however if you think of the system as a whole (including the community), it runs itself
@_date: 2015-05-21 09:14:56
the idiocy in this thread is amazing

So how can we ever know if the 'community' is in consensus if we don't know what the community is?
@_date: 2016-11-06 21:04:33
or blockchains
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:33:06
i think its fair tho tbh

unfortunately they have imagined wrong ;)

the unwashed masses keep the price up
@_date: 2016-09-24 19:06:02


you are officially an idiot. the two are not at all comparable
I hope your bitcoin fork goes well
@_date: 2016-09-24 10:56:22
actually no, hash rate has been increasing this year - despite price pullbacks. 
Bitcoin is always improving. Do you know how much work the devs are putting into this every day? Segwit v. close to release.
Sure other coins could come that are better but until that day comes, Im all in BTC
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:10:42
Hi Pierre-Marie, any idea of launch date?
@_date: 2016-09-23 10:27:30
explain why it would hard fork
@_date: 2016-09-24 17:23:07
@_date: 2016-09-24 11:12:03
where did you get this date from?
@_date: 2016-09-24 11:43:26
I also follow the milestones and slack. I was told after the scaling conference but this may be out of date
@_date: 2016-09-24 11:09:34
It's not as simple as 1 line of code my man. Changing one line of consensus code has massive implications for the network and also sets a really bad precedent! 
Also segwit has the same effect as a block size increase - but with more benefits. 
Bitcoin blocks were always going to become full at some point. Increasing the block size is a kick the can down the road approach that stores up a lot of problems for later. 
Also, look at the core scaling roadmap. I believe you will find a block size increase in there ;)
@_date: 2016-09-07 10:59:45
thats just marketing. log in now and see if they are still a bitcoin company
@_date: 2016-09-12 10:14:48
bahahaha this is amazing
@_date: 2016-09-07 10:23:13
pretty sure the entire point of Circle is that they use bitcoin as rails
@_date: 2016-09-24 19:43:13
i give in. xt is clearly superior
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:15:09
@_date: 2016-09-24 17:21:37
The community isn't going anywhere my man.
You do realize that the block size limit will inevitably be reached at some point right? You can't just keep raising it for ever
@_date: 2016-09-24 17:26:11
lightening network
@_date: 2016-09-23 10:08:23
for there to be no blocks there would have to be no miners. miners aren't going anywhere. I would say the price would have to go to $0 for all the miners to drop out, but that's not even true - there were miners even before bitcoin had a price
@_date: 2016-09-22 11:49:17
lol ur an idiot
@_date: 2016-09-24 17:24:36
'these people' are ensuring bitcoin remains political
@_date: 2016-09-24 17:26:36
see core scaling roadmap
@_date: 2016-09-23 15:42:56
you havent explained anything. why would a dropping hashrate cause bitcoin to fork?
also why would the hash rate drop?
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:51:55
90000 convenience store owners is pretty good tho
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:38:20
so what happens after all the coins have been mined?
@_date: 2016-10-04 15:44:06
@_date: 2016-10-10 16:28:06
even for cash?

what will happen when the block subsidy goes away?
i'll answer for you. fees.
@_date: 2015-10-24 09:16:14
people are dumb
@_date: 2016-05-23 17:04:02
and has been rejected by the technical community. going on about it on reddit isn't going to change anything
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:15:26
the real satoshi would provide elegant proof, not this messy bs
@_date: 2016-05-23 21:19:14
that's not possible i'm afraid man
@_date: 2016-05-21 07:23:58
all i said was that the hf is in the road map. no more no less.
@_date: 2016-05-23 15:13:55
bitcoin is complex, simple does not necessarily mean good...
@_date: 2016-05-23 20:42:25
i agree about diversity of coins, bitcoin can't be all things to all people
i personally am happy with i'm ok with core's conservative approach to block size, because i think its a longer sighted approach
@_date: 2016-05-23 13:24:01
to be fair it is a technical debate. and i say this as a non coder
@_date: 2016-05-23 15:14:55
10 minute blocks? thats how bitcoin works...
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:13:15
i'll bet you 1$ can we do it with a smart contract?
@_date: 2016-05-23 13:30:08
write some code, g.
@_date: 2016-05-23 17:11:49
i frequent the other bitcoin sub. More devs are backing core.
At the end of the day its the miners who decide, and they have spoken. What u gonna do?
@_date: 2015-10-22 17:55:57
@_date: 2016-05-23 13:05:04

anyone who uses the word 'bankster' immediately loses my attention
@_date: 2016-05-23 15:16:23
but when the block subsidy goes away fees will go up and down according to demand... like they do now
