That burden of proof stuff is way off the mark.  It's true that in the United States legal system criminal claims have a higher burden of proof, but having said that:
**Solvency is not a crime:**  Burdens of proof apply to legal findings.  Whether or not Mt. Gox is solvent (and honestly/more importantly, the extent to which they are solvent - having assets which are 5% short of liabilities is different than having assets 95% short of liabilities) is an objective, factual matter.
The higher burden of proof associated with crimes arises from the fact that the question of law is whether a certain fact pattern fits all of the elements of a crime.  It generally involves coming to decisions about mental states and debatable conduct, not simple factual accounting matters.

But nobody is advocating for the widespread use of gold for repeated small transactions.  The tax implications of buying and selling gold are quite complicated, unless you take the devil-may-care / ship wreck approach.
The headline here misses the real importance - property vs. currency isn't that gigantic a distinction to the average user.  The big news is that the IRS has pondered bitcoin on the tree of woe and has come up with a crapload of guidance, including an ominous final question about penalties for lack of compliance prior to the release of this guidance.

Look, the law is complicated.  People train for years for the profession, largely because the definitions, categories, standards, etc. are *complicated.*
There is no universal definition of money, property, vending machine, or ATM.   There isn't supposed to be, and it's not clever or cute to point out surface level inconsistencies.  The legal definitions of those terms only matters in the context of particular statutes, regulations, administrative decisions, and court cases that address them.  And just as important, they only matter in the specific context and jurisdiction they arise in.  Different countries, states, regulators, and contexts are likely to all have different interpretations and rules for common words.
The law leaves a lot to be desired with respect to simplicity and clarity - nobody will argue with that.  But the law exists and has to be dealt with.  Memes like this oversimplify things and make the community look childish and arrogant.

To add to this, the reason the 10x multiplier comes up (although misused or badly oversimplified by OP) is that the money lent out probably winds up in a bank, where again 10% of it can be kept as a reserve then lent out again.

Suing journalists is a major uphill battle, even if they are wrong.  The legal system affords a lot of protection to the press, because "sue the newspaper" is a common reaction people have to stories they don't like.  If it were easy, it would have a chilling effect on legitimate journalism.

That's... not even close to an accurate description of how the law works.
The laws of the United States apply under very factually specific circumstances based on the parties and the conduct involved.  It's substantially more complicated than whether or not one legal subsidiary of a business entity happens be registered with certain regulators or states.
More importantly, in the realm of international law enforceability means everything.  A country can proclaim jurisdiction over anything it wants, but without extradition treaties and willing counterparties your laws only extends as far as your police force is willing to make house calls.

There will absolutely be a launch date - that's how selling securities works.  You put together a preliminary prospectus and market it to the public.
"Insider trading info" wouldn't apply - insider trading laws apply to the purchase and sale of securities, so it's actually impossible for there to be material non-public information in the context of securities which don't yet exist.
Once they DO exist, all of that info must be disclosed BEFORE the sale - that's what SEC requirements on disclosure are all about.

No - precious metal stores already have dynamic USD pricing.  Even if priced in BTC, there is no reason to expect it would be static.  So if the price of gold remained flat in [currency of choice, let's say USD but I'm not sure where amagi is based] but the price of BTC vs. that currency changed, odds are they would dynamically be adjusting the amount of BTC each unit of precious metal cost.
You can see this phenomena clearly in the U.S. in ETFs that hold foreign securities - the price moves because of exchange rate differences as well as changes in the value of the underlying securities in whatever currency or currencies they are denominated in.

Business insider link to article:  
The formal tax implications of bitcoin are likely to be a nightmare. See here:
**Q-6:**  Does a taxpayer have gain or loss upon an exchange of virtual currency for other property?
**A-6:**  Yes. 
- - - 
Basically, a tax liability will exist any time you buy BTC, BTC appreciates, and then you exchange BTC for (goods / services / currency).  A tax loss will exist any time the opposite is true (i.e. you buy BTC, BTC depreciates, and then you exchange BTC for (goods / services / currency).
That's not surprising to anybody familiar with the tax code, but it's a huge headache for useability - especially if the IRS decides to go after U.S. based exchanges and service providers for records on such things. 
Like all tax rules, it will become a matter of tracking and enforcing.  There are a million tax rules that get ignored, but the IRS will hunt down big pots of money wherever it can find them, and the implications can chill business development.
As a quick example, a consumer might not give a shit about the tax liability from small-scale bitcoin purchases, but McDonalds will think twice before accepting bitcoin if it's going to be burdensome to track the tax consequences of purchases and sales.

Whether or not you agree with the laws, that's always how money laundering statutes have worked.

It is either difficult or impossible to sell less than one share of a security, because of the methods by which securities are tracked and exchanged.
For this reason, stock splits are material different: it's actually more difficult to transact as the price goes up, because there's bigger jumps in purchase and sell decisions. 
Bitcoin does not have this issue, since it is finely dividable. 
While there may ALSO be some psychological impact inherent in the concept of a stock split, it's a different set of circumstances.

There are gray areas an exception, but federal income tax is not one of them.

**Edit:** Feel free to keep downvoting, but my point stands. This comment is 30 minutes old and there haven't been any new trades of reportable size in $GBTC shares. Total volume for today is 301 shares, equivalent to about 30 bitcoins. Lowest ask is $175/share and is just a single share. The market is tiny, illiquid, and presently frozen with a huge bid/ask spread. 
**Edit 2**: Over an hour later, still no new trades.
**Edit 3:** Two and a half hours later, back from lunch, and now I look dumb because this isn't downvoted at all. Oops/thanks! Anyway, volume is up from 301 shares to 389 shares, bid/ask spread now $60/$90 (huge as opposed to titanic), and price looks about the same but still miniscule volume. The top two bids/asks both appear to be from the same two firms, which is interesting. Not sure if they're market making, trading based on customer orders, or something else entirely. 
**Edit 4:** Another two hours pass, and a single additional share has traded (390, up from 389). 
**Edit 5:** Market appears to have closed at 435 shares traded daily volume, or about 43.5 bitcoins worth of shares. If my math and research is right, that's less than one half of one percent of Coinbase's 24-hour volume.

Not true.
If you buy a stock, you are buying a share of ownership of the company, and become a residual claimant of its profits. The price of the stock moves up and down, but your ownership interest in the business venture and the potential for a stream of dividends means that it isn't the case that "if you are making money, someone else is losing money." Bonds are generally the same, as they pay a fixed coupon/interest over the term of the instrument. 
With commodities and currencies, on the other hand, the only way to make money is buy buying low and selling high, which is in fact a zero-sum game. 
That doesn't mean commodities and currencies are unsustainable as investments, but it does mean greater care needs to be taken when deciding to invest. Without profit potential or cash flows, they are very different from stocks and bonds when evaluating them as financial assets. 
Warren Buffet frequently discusses this as his reason for not investing in gold. That doesn't make it correct or an absolute rule, but it's an interesting perspective.

This is incredibly amateurish analysis.  You're comparing the market capitalization of a public company to the supply of a currency. Why, exactly?
And beyond that, you picked Berkshire Hathaway, which is more or less an investment company itself, and in no way related to bitcoin or currency.  You just picked a big number and said "yeah why not!" 
The value of a corporation is related to expectations of its future profitability, the value of bitcoin is a substantially more amorphous concept, but will be pegged to its utility as a store of value and for transaction processing.
Leaving all that aside, you're certainly correct that if bitcoin takes off and gets used by a significant fraction of the global population, the value of each bitcoin will have to dramatically increase.  But the important analysis isn't "what's the most absurdly large number I can think of for bitcoin's total value" but rather "what would it take to get there, what obstacles would be along the way, and when those obstacles come up, how likely is it they will be resolved such that bitcoin - and not some alternative - continues as the primary globally accepted cryptocurrency?"

Such a circlejerk post. It's sad simplifications and low-effort platitudes like this rocket up the front page of Society is already drifting cashless because it's convenient. Everyone likes that. Bitcoin happens to be digital/cashless, but you can't ascribe all of those benefits to bitcoin without realizing how many of them can, do, or will exist for fiat currency as well. 
With respect to control, the banks don't give a shit what you do with your money, but AML/KYC regulations from the government force them to ask questions and often slow things down. It's fine to disagree with those, and fine to push for change, but it's not a conspiracy (or even if it is, it's coming from the government and not the banks). 


This is myopic. To use bitcoin you had to set up a wallet and you are now ALWAYS 100% in charge of your own security. You've traded the risk of identity theft and the hassle of entering numbers or handing over a card for the responsibility of securing your own funds without recourse and keeping up with tech developments to secure your funds.
Fair trade? Maybe. But huge swaths of the population will laugh out loud if you describe the inconvenience of credit card use or try to suggest trading identity theft risks for bitcoin theft risks is the way to go for most or even many people.

Shares of $GBTC that are trading at a premium to the price of bitcoin have no one-year restriction. 
Shares of $GBTC that come with a one year restriction have an identical price to bitcoin (after small fees), there is no premium. 
You're discussing the premium and the one year restriction, and comparing that to a futures contract, but there are no $GBTC shares that both have a premium and are subject to a one year restriction.

That can only happen one time per share. Each person who purchased $GBTC directly form the fund (more than a year ago) can do this, but once that happens, there's nothing left to push the price to equilibrium, as only new holders who paid a premium have shares eligible for trade on the OTC market. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:17:24
Keep in mind that even if everybody who owned GBTC before the OTC trading began sold their shares, you'd just run right into illiquidity again as the new holders waited for their investment to payoff.
Without a robust and timely arbitrage mechanism, this will by definition be a small and illiquid market. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:58:47
It's doubly idiotic because you can but GBTC shares by the truckload for current NAV (so roughly $24) directly from the fund, they're just subject to a lockup period.
So the only coherent thesis for paying a premium for the OTC shares is believing not only that the value you will rise, but that it will rise in less than a year AND you will need or want to sell at that point.

1. Of course, value transmitted is equal to the number of transactions times the market price of bitcoin times the average number of bitcoins per transaction. I can't tell if this graph accounts for bitcoin per transaction, but I can tell you that looking at similar graphs it appears total value transmitted has remained largely flat.
2. Between off-chain transactions and non-economic on-chain transactions (moving coins between your own two wallets as just one example) it's very difficult to extract meaningful information from the number of transactions over time.

Supply is tiny, trading volume is tiny, and there's no structural mechanic for either of those to change. You're seeing people speculate with small sums of money or just making the trade for the novelty.
Many argue that there's at least a one-step arbitrage opportunity in that current holders of $GBTC shares who can sell on the OTC markets can sell their shares OTC at a premium then buy new shares at the net asset value directly from Greyscale, subject to a new 12-month lockup period. While mechanically true, there is no indication that sufficient volume of bids will exist to support the premiums if a long-term holder attempts to cash out at scale. 
@_date: 2015-05-10 16:24:48
The same people who are arguing about blocksize increases could just as easily add inflaction or increase the bitcoin supply in other ways.

I think this is naive. When the first gold ETFs came out, did the price of gold increase by 16.5x? 
It's already possible for anybody to buy bitcoin's online, meaning the ETF will add less utility than other commodity ETFs did. I certainly agree the ETF will make it easier or more direct for some people, but then the next question is, why would they invest in it?
For better or for worse, everyone looks at past performance when evaluating investment decisions - getting into bitcoin won't be an easy sell after 2014's nosedive.
In short, if the ETF launches I could see demand and media attention increasing and the price going up, but a 16.5x increase seems absurd.

What makes you say this? In the U.S., income tax is levied on income from whatever source derived. If you buy a non-U.S. currency and its value appreciates, you will be taxed on your profit. The *mechanics* are slightly different than for gains derived from trading in securities or real property, but the tax obligation isn't materially different. 
I feel like this is something that was lost on a lot of people when the guidance came out. While the IRS put digital currency into "bucket A" instead of "bucket B," the actual tax implications of the two buckets were not ever vastly different. 
As a simple example, forex traders are already paying taxes on their profits...

This headline is a bit overstated - this isn't a steady trend, and there's no reason to expect it to be. Yesterday the volume was a fraction of what it is today, something trivial like 400 shares, down almost 90% from prior days and late last week.
Volume is big again today, but you're looking at an extremely illiquid security that will only have occasional trades of notable size. As long as there are bids at a premium to the net asset value of the bitcoin held by the fund, you will see long-term holders selling to new buyers, if only because they can then buy more directly from the fund or buy bitcoin directly at cost. So those long-term holders can earn money even if they feel like keeping their position, but that's a one-time quasi-arbitrage. There aren't many shares, and each share has an incentive to trade hands once and only once (from long term holder to new buyer) under the current mechanics of the fund. 
But because new shares can't quickly enter the market due to the 12-month lockup period, supply will be *extremely* constrained and the market is going to be illiquid. There's just no way around it given the mechanics of an OTC traded fund like this - it's not like an ETF where supply can expand and everyone who wants a piece of the action can get it without sending the price badly out of alignment with the fund's NAV.
So yes, large lots of shares will move now and then, but celebrating a "new daily volume record" after seeing almost no shares trade yesterday is a bit disingenuous. We're not talking about stably climbing volume or an asset that can be expected to maintain high volume. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:21:26
I mean, there's demand and then there's demand.

That's not completely right. First, capital gains tax rates are often *lower* than the tax rates an individual would pay for ordinary income tax. Let's leave that aside for now though and focus on whether or not a transaction would generate an income tax liability *of any kind.* 
There are *exemptions* for *small* personal transactions that result in gains due to fluctuations in foreign currency, but the default rule absolutely requires income tax to be paid on gains from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. 
So in your zoo example, as long as the gains are relatively small (It's something like $200?), you're correct that you wouldn't owe tax - but it would be because of a narrow exception to the general rule.

(1) I believe that mechanism is no longer available because of SEC concerns. Not being an investor I only have access to the bits and pieces of information scattered around, so I'm only mostly sure of that based on things I've read from second-hand sources though. 
(2) Even if that mechanism were functional, it can't create shares eligible for public trading on the OTC markets. 
(3) That mechanism is what a true ETF uses to maintain price parity, and would allow for very direct coupling of the security and the underlying asset. If the COIN ETF gets off the ground, that will operate that way and it will be great.

A *major* difference is that banks lend money out over long terms while holding short-term demand deposits (i.e. fractional reserve lending). This is not a feature of the bitcoin protocol - the bitcoins are always held by a single address.
You can of course be politically or economically critical of fractional reserve lending. But as a technical matter, ignoring it while looking at clearance times is comparing apples and oranges.

@_date: 2015-08-13 15:01:55


Not true at all. Each financial institution is engaged in significantly different lines of business. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are the two large investment banks that are primarily engaged in traditional investment banking activities (M&amp;A, capital markets, trading, investment advise, etc.) but many of the others - including BofA - have huge amounts of traditional baking activities (checking accounts, savings accounts, home/auto/business loans) that dwarf the size of their investment banking arms on their balance sheets. 
Here's one concrete example: In a recent year, 38% of J.P. Morgan's revenue came from corporate &amp; investment banking and 12% came from asset management. But 43%(!) was consumer &amp; community banking, and 7% was commercial banking. MS and GS will tilt much more heavily to investment banking, but other banks will tilt towards consumer lending.

No it's not. Even once all of the paperwork is done allowing original holders to sell on the public market, the total number of liquid shares will be small. This isn't going to blow open the doors to securities markets.
Most importantly, unlike the proposed ETF, there is no arbitrage mechanic to trade shares for bitcoins or bitcoins for shares. That means if the price of the shares gets high due to liquidity issues, that demand won't spill over to bitcoins via other channels.  
@_date: 2015-04-29 20:14:30
This is *incredibly* misleading - it was misleading as a talking point yesterday, and is doubly misleading as an "article" now. 
(1) There are no GBTC securities for sale on the OTC markets. Zero. You could bid eleventy bazillion dollars for shares that don't exist, and it would be risk free, because *there aren't any shares to buy.* Order books are incredibly dynamic - often algorithmically dynamic - and that goes double for published and public order books. There is no reason to expect shares to trade for that price. 
(2) Eventually, SOME current shareholders MIGHT complete a deposit process that would allow them to trade their shares on the OTC markets. Readers of do not know when this will happen, but for market participants - who are on the phone with one another all day and have experience with DTC timelines, OTC markets, and new securities coming to market, *the first trades will not be a surprise*. They're going to know when there are securities for sale, at which point they will have **no reason** to bid with an enormous premium. Even if they're willing to pay that, there's no reason to let such a bid sit in an orderbook when they could likely get shares much closer to spot/NAV price. 
(3) To expand on that, I have not heard a single compelling reason for GBTC shares to trade for a premium over the bitcoin spot price. Most importantly, institutional investors are entirely capable of buying bitcoin directly, buying shares of GBTC from the fund directly at its NAV (subject to a 12-month lockup period), and entering into more exotic arrangements that you can't get on e-trade but *which are common in the financial industry.* Take gold ETFs as an example: they generally trade at a discount to the spot price of gold, and while they increased the accessibility of gold to many investors, institutional investors had plenty of access to gold, gold futures, and gold derivatives beforehand. Bitcoin isn't that mature, but it's not worlds apart either: GBTC (or the COIN ETF) will *not* be the first, or the only, means of "institutional investors" (however defined) to gain exposure to bitcoin in a compliant fashion. There are huge numbers of other asset classes - commodities, real estate, currencies, etc. - that all kinds of institutional investors have money in, and have had money in long before exchange-traded securities existed as a vehicle for them to do so.
For all of those reasons, "bids" on securities that *don't exist and can't be traded* represent no information about the state of the market or the market to-be. The article has no information in it that can't be gleaned from looking at one OTC market's public order book and running some google searches. 
- - - - -
For more background on GBTC itself, in particular why it is not an ETF and shouldn't be expected to directly impact the bitcoin market to a great degree, see my post [here](
Most importantly, there will be no systematic arbitrage opportunity connecting the GBTC fund and the price of bitcoin itself. Even if the shares trade at a premium, there will be no way for new shares to be purchased without being subject to the 12-month lockup period. If supply gets low, it will just stay low, and the end result will be *illiquidity* not purchase pressure on bitcoin. 
And any potential purchaser of GBTC shares OTC has and will have the option of purchasing shares directly from GBTC subject to the 12-month lockup.
@_date: 2015-04-02 23:48:43


Unlikely that's delaying the government - the ETF is under review by the SEC, a federal regulator. The existence of a state regulatory scheme (Lawsky's bitlicense) is conceptually but not directly related. Of course the uncertainty of regulations like NY's bitlicense might be making the ETF promoters more cautious. 
To answer the OP directly: there is likely back and forth between the SEC, the promoters of the ETF, and their lawyers. It's an ongoing process, not an indefinite hold. All of the novelty surrounding bitcoin itself and a financial product related to bitcoin make the delay unsurprising - the SEC isn't known for its alacrity at the best of times. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 00:04:36
This assumes there's broad demand for shares at a premium (which may be true, I just don't assume it - why would somebody buy OTC at a premium instead of either directly from GBTC or an exchange at market price?). 
Even if that's true, as soon as the shares move from original holders to those who were willing to pay a premium, the liquidity would dry up at that point (until new purchasers had a reason to sell, including but not necessarily limited to the price of bitcoin rising). 
@_date: 2015-04-05 19:16:57
That's... insane. 
First, lawyers don't know everything - one of the most frustrating tasks a lawyer is faced with is getting material information from their client.
Second, lawyers have a role that is generally well functioning even when the client is having trouble *by design*. Fundamentally, corporate counsel provides advice and crafts strategies to comply with laws and minimize the impact of litigation, a job that is *most critical* when the organization is in trouble. The worse things get, the more they might need lawyers, and there is hardly any stigma associated with helping a client out of a tight spot. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 01:16:49
No, you are wrong. What you are describing is how an ETF works. GBTC is not an ETF, and has significant lockup periods for newly issued shares. If it issues new shares, they cannot be sold on the secondary market for 12 months. 
So the part of your process "the AP can sell those GBTC for USD which give him profit" can't happen for 12 months after the part of your process where the AP gets new shares from GBTC.

You're confusing the mechanics for the COIN ETF with the mechanics for the GBTC fund. This fund will be very illiquid - the ONLY shares that can be traded OTC are those already held by investors for a year, meaning a limited market and no arbitrage mechanic for creating more shares and making them available to the public.
More shares can be created and sold directly to investors, but they then need to be held for a year before they can trade on the OTC markets.

Major financial institutions don't earn their profits by buying low and selling high - they earn their profits by charging fees. For their extremely profitable business model, the price of an commodity, currency, or financial instrument is all but irrelevant relative to the transaction volume or investment size associated with it. 
If anything, a high bitcoin price would be to their advantage, as the larger scale of the ecosystem would increase the potential pool of fees and number of participants looking for their services.
As the top comment points out, assuming banks are anti-bitcoin, or even anti-bitcoin price, is naive. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 00:07:02
I'm not really sure what you're asking. The trust engages in buying and selling bitcoin already, that's how it works - but that's restricted to the supply/demand equation between the trust and its investors. GBTC has existed for a year - the attention now is focused on the new OTC market for its shares, which will not include arbitrage mechanisms the way a traditional ETF would.

GBTC can issue shares at roughly the cost of bitcoin to accredited* investors, which will be cheaper than the shares trade on the OTC markets if there is a premium for GBTC vs. underlying BTC value - but once they do, those newly issued shares *cannot* be traded on the OTC market until they have *also* been held for a year. The year holding period makes it no longer arbitrage - the price of BTC and/or the premium for the shares could change significantly during the year between the shares being issued and their being available to trade, so it's not risk-free. 
*I'm using this term loosely here, even though it's a term of art with respect to U.S. securities regulations

In my opinion the biggest boon of bitcoin (not back by a government, decentralized on top of that, and relatively anonymous / untraceable) is also the biggest impediment to its success. 
The "build up" of trust works in the bitcoin economy just like a regular economy. Iterated transactions will make people believe in you.
But unlike in a regular economy, there is no enforcement. So a bad day or a mean streak or a hack or a flare up of greed could make any business decide to "walk away" and grab an armful of bitcoins, likely without repercussion. 
In reading about bitcoin over the past months, I'm seeing a lot of the negatives of human nature on prominent display.

It would not be legal. The income tax is based on income from whatever source derived. 
Just like you can't avoid income taxes by paying employees in pesos, real estate, free tacos, or back massages. 
The capital gains argument wouldn't work, because for something to be a capital gain the income has to be a return on capital. So if you but $1,000 worth of bitcoins and they appreciate to $1,500 or if you invest $1,000 worth of bitcoins in a business and it returns $1,500 worth of bitcoins to you the marginal increase in value would be capital gains, but there would be no way to massage a payroll into being a capital gain.
Hedge funds get away with it because that's where their profits come from. No need to convert to bitcoin.
Obviously the nature of bitcoin would make *lying* to the IRS substantially easier and make detection substantially less likely. But you don't really need a cryptocurrency to perform some good old fashioned tax evasion.
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:00:22
Bitcoin may have a lot going for it in the VC and regulatory space, but it's still missing the most important piece of the puzzle for price: **demand**
Buying goods on the black market represents true demand for bitcoin - it can't really be done any other way. Almost every other non-speculative use case is aspirational, frequently requiring a kind of catch-22 line of reasoning (along the lines of, "Group X will want/use bitcoin once group Y wants/uses bitcoin."). 
Remittance is a good example: the world already has the *technology* for quickly transferring data in a ledger. Currency exchange, financial regulations, and infrastructure issues drive up costs - almost none of which bitcoin directly solves. Of course if everyone already used/wanted/accepted bitcoin it would obliterate Western Union, but as long as the problem is people having fiat A in location X but wanting fiat B in location Y, I struggle to see how bitcoin *as a technology* solves the problem. 
I've been following bitcoin for years now (and own some!), but I'm growing more skeptical of its growth prospects. I see a long speculative phase (that may have been fueled by manipulation) in the rear view mirror with little to fuel robust demand going forward.
Bitcoin is cool, the technology is cool, and it's accomplished a huge amount already - but I see no reason to *expect* a price surge at any point in the future.

Gold is not used as a medium for exchange in markets. It is (by fiat) allowed to be held as tier 1 capital under international banking reserve agreements, which gives it a purpose in the international financial world but does not make it money any more than a 30-year treasury bond or a share of google stock.
It is also used to create bullion products by governments, as best as anyone can tell for nostalgia.

There is not, and will never be, a fully decentralized exchange that interfaces with fiat currencies.

**Context and quick thoughts:**
[I've got a background in securities and am interested in, but still skeptical of, bitcoin]
This will likely have very limited liquidity, and as a consequence, very limited impact on the market. Because *new* shares cannot be publicly issued or traded, the arbitrage mechanism by which a fully approved and operational ETF can maintain price parity with its underlying asset (and also expand and contract supply as necessary) will not be available.
If, hypothetically, lots of people wanted to buy this product to gain exposure to bitcoin, they would just deplete the supply and that would be it - no more bitcoin being bought to create new shares, as would be the case in a traditional ETF (where authorized participants, in theory, could trade lots of shares for BTC or lots of BTC for shares with the operator of the ETF). 
Anybody with the means and interest to acquire exposure to bitcoin already has a menu of options, including just buying bitcoin instead of a fund or security tied to bitcoin. Since this will still involve additional costs and complexity, have limited supply, and not be as readily available as a traditional ETF, I don't think this will have nearly the impact many suspect the ETF will have (I also question how much impact the ETF would have if it went live, but this analysis is focused on comparing this to the ETF).

Bitcoin rising in value is hardly necessary for it to become true competition to other payment systems or gaining popularity! Bitcoin rising in value is only good for people who see it as a form of investment. Ideally it'll just stop somewhere, and stay relatively stable. Its price point is much less important than its stability.

No. You can never have a "decentralized exchange" without a centralized entity at some point in the process before you can have fiat. Colored coins do not change that, "bit USD" does not change that, and local bitcoin trading apps approach changing that but cripple the ability to do it at scale and/or over large distances. 
Only legislation that changes the banking regulatory framework could possibly change that.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:17:14
I think we're mostly saying the same thing. But the more public and important any entity in the chain gets, the more subject to regulation they will become.
As a very easy example, GoogleShareCoin cannot be issued or exchanged in U.S. markets without complying with SEC regulations surrounding the distribution and sale of securities. Dollar coin style instruments will hit similar issues with money transmission and KYC/AML regulations.
Once you have a piece of the chain hit regulation, they have to either stay small to avoid them, or comply with them. And once they comply with them... where is the value in being almost-but-not-quite decentralized?

Bitcoin doesn't really help with this yet, because you still take on fees and risks to transfer between currencies.
Until there is a seamless world where people are willing to hold bitcoin, sending and receiving for free (or low cost/cost subsidized by mining rewards) is only half the battle. 
Currency exchange is risky, and services that do it won't do it for free.

There are lots of exchanges. Many are compliant with all relevant laws. Adding another is mildly good news for the ecosystem, but there's no reason to expect a massive surge in demand just because there's one more way to buy bitcoin.

As long as there are anonymous businesses, there will be exit scams. It's an incredibly high expected-value decision. You literally turn trust and business skill into a bigger mountain of money faster by exit scamming than running good long-term business.

The bank takes on short term debt - most simply, a demand deposit checking or savings account, that theoretically could need to be repaid at any moment. The bank then gives out long-term loans - most simply, a house mortgage paid back over 30 years. The bank pays less interest to short-term depositors than it collects from its long-term borrowers.
There's nothing mystical, magical, or "musical chairs" involved, and you don't even need "a bank" to do something similar. If you hand me ten $10 bills, and in exchange I promise you access whenever you want but I'll pay you 1% interest, then I give $90 out to other people and charge them 3% interest, we're in the exact same spot.
The risk, of course, is a "run on the bank" where you want your $100 back and I can't give it to you because the $90 is still out on loan. The business of banking is managing that risk and earning a profit, and sometimes it goes poorly, which is what the FDIC exists for (note that banks pay premiums for FDIC insurance). In practice, it turns out not everyone needs their money all at once, and there's so value in that business - because there's demand for capital to Do Work (hire workers, improve property, open and fund businesses) and there's an ample supply of capital that people keep for themselves without having the means to evaluate projects and make loans. The bank, ideally, serves the role of compensating people for allocating their capital for other projects and earns money for themselves in the process.
The system has a number of flaws, risks, and weaknesses - plus a checkered past. It's great to engage in healthy debate on those points, but it's oversimplifying and a weak argument to just declare it fraud and musical chairs. If you think the traditional banking system needs reform or even to be redone entirely that's fine, but if you aren't actually engaging with the substance it's just shouting into the wind.

You can't really have a talk about bitcoin, poverty and wealth distribution without looking at the absurd concentration of bitcoin. It's not just satoshi - a small group holds an absurd number of coins, and any major increase in price/adoption will catapault them to riches.

The dollar hasn't lost any ground at all relative to the things you purchase with dollars. That's a very illogical argument.

Bitcoins have value in making it hard to be caught doing illicit things. They don't suddenly make them legal.

**That's not right.** At all. 
It's not right for a host of reasons.
First, you're linking to a rule that has to do with reporting income and paying taxes on self employment income. While BTC's tax status is confusing, it's extremely likely that its reportable as capital gains income, which is a regime totally outside of what you linked.
Second, the item you mentioned has to do with penalties for underpayment in those circumstances and NOT your overall tax liability. There are still tons of ways you could miscalculate the tax and owe more, and no matter what you do the amount of tax you owe won't be changed by simply over-paying for the prior year.

The amount of misinformation being spread in this thread is staggering. 
The FDIC isn't perfect and there's a lot to complain about with respect to the banking system and bank regulations in the united states. 
But just as a PSA - deposit insurance exists and has worked - repeatedly. Banks in this country fail, and depositors do not lose money. The system hasn't changed or been undone. 
It's fine to be nervous about the system in the future, but there is absolutely no indication that deposit insurance in the United States is in jeopardy. 
Even in Cyprus, there was concern that deposit insurance might prove to be illusory - **but those fears proved to be unfounded.** Insured depositors (under the 100,000 Euro limit) didn't lose money, and even depositors over that limit didn't lose their first 100,000 Euros.

The difference is that social networks couldn't interact with one another. You were either on facebook, or myspace, or both, but the worlds were very separate. 
With crypto currencies, exchanges really break down the barriers. An exchange allowing transfers between CloneCoin, Bitcoin, and USDollars makes holding a Clonecoin very nearly as useful as holding a bitcoin. You can send it online, you can either spend it for goods or quickly convert it to something you can spend for goods, it's secure, can be held in cold storage, etc. 
The "network effect" arguments are overly simple, because with cryptocurrencies it is MUCH easier to bootstrap onto an existing network.

There is genuine skepticism and controversy relating to many of the practices surrounding day trading. Many academics (as well as many other traders and finance types) have disdain for technical analysis and a *lot* of the "gospel" that emerges from day traders. 
I'm not here to say it's all hogwash, but it's important to realize that if you learned about economics and trading from within the bitcoin bubble, there's a good chance you're missing a lot of the big picture. At the end of the day, the efficient market hypothesis (in strong or semi-strong form) is damn hard to disprove on anything like a consistent basis. There's strong evidence that either luck pervades over skill, or at least that we have no reliable means of determining when success comes from skill and when it comes from luck.

Honsetly, maybe not until the market is much larger. There's a lot to speculate about - even if you came up with a sophisticated model for BTC's price, it would be subject to wild swings as the probability of future events changed. 
Example: Assume the 'true value' of BTC is $10,000 per coin if it succeeds but $0 if an alternative crypto currency takes over. Say a news event increases the odds of that happening from 1% to 2% - that alone would cause a huge shift in whatever the current price of bitcoin was.

Bubbles "bursting" takes weeks or months in most markets. A few initial surges downward kill the confidence investors/speculators had in the underlying asset to rise indefinitely, but that doesn't mean it falls to zero immediately. 
Of course, bitcoin is very uncertain and gaining popularity and traction - as more services online, more articles get written, etc. the price could certainly rise.

People are giving you a lot of shit, so I want to try and help:


Because NASDAQ is a highly, highly regulated exchange - and in addition to that, it values its reputation in the network of sophisticated commercial participants.
Mt. Gox, as others have noted, is a Japanese business entity that operates in the grey areas of the law. There's a reason it's difficult and slow to get funds to them: because they're operating in the financial wild west, and few legitimate financial institutions were willing to be counter parties with them for that reason. 
As to suing, three points. First, I know fuckall about Japanese law, so this info will be based on some general legal principals.
Second, you might be able to sue for fraud or theft if it turns out something like that happened.
But third, there isn't a general legal theory that an operator of an exchange is liable for losses of participants, even if their technology fails. In a famous similar example, if a shipping company is late delivering a windmill shaft and the grainery loses profits while the windmill is down, the shipping company is generally not liable for those losses. 
You might actually want to contact a Japanese lawyer though. You could potentially get a settlement out of this, depending on how shady they were. It's unlikely and far-fetched, but not impossible.

On the flip side, BTC is a currency, whereas financial assets like stocks and bonds are (while taking on risk of failure) supposed to appreciate and/or pay dividends. 
I won't argue that the financial industry is greedy, but stocks and bonds do, over time and in the aggregate, work as advertised - they give people more money in the future than the instruments cost to buy in the present.

Interest rate swaps, futures, and many other common financial derivatives have been humming along without issue for quite some time. They're a little hard to understand and can certainly be risky when misused, but it is much more complicated than "notional cf reality."

I'm currently working on this thought experiment: 
If anybody could, at any time, start a Bitcoin 2 (or 3, or 4, etc.) which has identical properties to Bitcoin, what makes *this* one special?
It's like if in addition to gold, there were unlimited amount of metals with identical properties but different colors. 
If the answer to "why is bitcoin different than any other crypto currency" is *really* "because we're already using it and it came first" that is worrisomely similar to bubble logic. They say only 21 million BTC can be mined, but in reality it's just 21 million units of this particular crypto currency. A limitless number of units can be created, if I understand it right, they just won't "play" with the originals. 
But they're still a currency, right? So if I start BTC 2, and create an exchange for converting BTC into BTC 2... haven't I just in effect inflated the supply of bitcoins, just with a mild intermediary inconvenience? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:15:32
More importantly, ANY cryptocurrency that can be exchanged with bitcoin is - in some small way - increasing the supply of "crypto currency units."
If I had $100 that I instead want to have in digitized, hard-to-trace, decentralized currency, I can buy bitcoins. or litecoins. 
Fewer businesses accept litecoins. But I can convert them to bitcoins, which means any rise in BTC price *due merely to a constrained supply* should be alleviated.

I suggest you do some research. Banks fail regularly in the U.S. - not that many, but several. The FDIC steps in, generally on a Friday night, and by Monday the banks are re-open and insured depositors are made whole. 
The whole *point* of FDIC insurance is that it removes the incentive for a bank run. And it actually has a proven track record, including during the extreme crunch of the financial crisis.
Is it perfect? No. Does it involve trusting the government, who often is up to no good? Yes. But it's much more trustworthy, and has a much better track record, than is described here.

Sigh. 
Goldman Sachs isn't taking their cut because companies lack the technology to connect with investors, they take their cut because they provide a very valuable service: the business of selling securities to investors, and of briding the trust/risk gap. Underwriting a securities offering is complicated, but not technically. 
Companies already can, and already have, attempted to tap the capital markets without using a bank to underwrite. It usually doesn't work very well.

No matter how effective BTC is, things like this are going to be a massive impediment to widespread adoption. It's complicated and requires careful learning + attention to keep your assets secured. 
While that's feasible, a true *currency* that is widely adopted sort of necessarily must cater to the least common denominator, or have services crop up to help do so...

There's a lot of mistaken reasoning when people compare BTC to other financial transaction systems. 
Credit card fees are expensive... but a big part of the reason is because that fee pays for **security** and **credit.**
If you lose your BTC, they're just gone. Like a stack of cash, vulnerable to hacking, neglect, ignorance, etc. There are no chargebacks in the world of BTC.
And you can only spend BTC you currently poses. A credit card extends a line of credit and a risk that you will fail to repay... and that's not out of the goodness of the bank's heart! 
The "problem" solved by BTC with respect to instantaneous transactions is one solved by computers and digitized bank accounts long ago. The reason financial systems can be slow - and expensive - is because the stakes are high, and because they provide additional layers of services and security - **not** because of technical limitations.

I'd argue that those are great choices to make in step 5. There's nothing wrong with putting a portion of your portfolio into guns/gold/food, possibly even a large amount - but for somebody with no financial literacy, I believe it would be a disservice to START there, especially because those assets already have a lot in common with BTC - and the point of diversification is decreasing the correlation between the assets you hold.

Credit cards also let consumers spend money that they don't have yet. And the consumer protections hurt sellers sometimes, but ALSO make consumers more willing to *engage* with sellers and thus increase the total number of transactions. 
Also, bitpay is solidly in "too good to be true" territory right now. The largest bitcoin exchange was down for 12 hours recently and prices have been swinging violently. SOMEBODY in the consumer &lt;-&gt; bitpay &lt;-&gt; business chain has to have born that risk.

Have you stopped to think about what a bank IS?

Is it a guy with a website and a safe... and if so, how does he interface with OTHER financial institutions and/or postal services to move funds around? 
If you set up an exchange there, what bank account do you use for receiving funds if not your own? If you use another country's banks, there goes your independence...

No. A stock is a unit of ownership in a company that is engaged in business and seeking to turn a profit. 
A bitcoin is some kind of currency, medium of exchange, or store of wealth. Its value relative to goods and services may change over time.
Both are risky, both could pay, both could go bust. But expecting the value of a currency/medium of exchange to increase is fundamentally different from expecting the value of an ownership interest in a business enterprise to increase.

Something about this doesn't sit well with me. I can't quite my finger on it, but it seems exploitative in a way... this project was created in reliance on powerful computers and distributed networks, and the early adopters all stand to profit massively if it is widely adopted. 
To the extent late adopters just didn't know about it, my moral compass doesn't flare up too much. But to the extent you're trying to advance the currency in a region where the technology to participate in mining didn't (and likely still doesn't) exist on a wide scale... I mean, is that right?
Bitcoin's market cap still hovers around a billion dollars. You could spin this as "Hey Africa! We printed a billion dollars then gave it to ourselves. Would you like to buy some? Our fiat is totally better than your government's fiat!"

Bitcoin is revolutionary for a few reasons: its source, the potential for anonymity, the ability to move money back and forth between individuals without a financial institution intermediary, etc.

We know it's not designed to return profits to its owners indefinitely though. 
Financial assets (bonds &amp; stocks) are created to transfer wealth over time. Somebody pays money now in exchange for payments in the future. 
Whatever bitcoin is, it isn't DESIGNED to do that. It's designed as a medium of exchange, or store of wealth, or anti-government something. It's really cool, but it's no more designed to appreciate than a pound sterling, a bar of gold, or a sandwich. Somebody might pay you more for any of those three in the future, but that doesn't make them like stocks.

Cyprus blew up, but cyprus is small and the Euro isn't dead. On the flip side, the U.S. market hit an *all time high* on Friday. 
A lot of the demand for gold came from people worried about their investments in stocks and bonds. To a number of people (and their money) gold is not seen as a reliable appreciating asset, but instead as a safe haven or disaster hedge. So you have two competing forces - a little disaster that might need hedging, and a big run up in the markets that people don't want to be on the sidelines for.

It's only "proven not to work" for assets that reliably have a larger than 0 estimated value; that is the rate at which they will appreciate is uncertain, but the fact of their appreciation is taken for granted. This is not true with bitcoin. You could argue it's not true for stocks or bonds and it wouldn't be a terrible argument, but I think you have to accept that in the modern world an investment in bitcoin has more risk - including complete wipeout - than an investment in stocks or bonds.
"proven not to work" also only means your long term gain is reduced, not that there are no benefits - it can reduce volatility.

It's a small and volatile market. That means a dedicated trader with enough wealth can move the market, not just attempt to profit on its otherwise unrelated movements. 
Information is also distributed less evenly than more sophisticated markets, so some people may have an edge that is less likely to exist elsewhere. 
Finally, the volatility means you can more easily win and lose big. This doesn't necessarily means it's a good thing for traders as a whole, but it does mean any individual trader might see a bigger take (and be more vocal about it) than in calmer seas.

The government does not feel threatened by bitcoin. Basically all of its response thus far has either been motivated by anti-money laundering or consumer protection/anti-fraud sentiment.  
If you truly live below the poverty line, you'll have a negligible tax burden despite living in a country full of infrastructure paid for by other people's tax dollars. 
When you deposit money in a bank, they do indeed loan it out and make slightly more money off of it than you... but they also provide you access, deposit insurance, and often interest. They're not evil, and commercial banks where you deposit money or take out loans are MUCH different animals than the investment banks people get worked up about. 
You also mention bitcoin's low fees... that's a huge oversimplification. There are massive fees and risks associated with obtaining and storing bitcoins. It's a small fee to transfer them from one bitcoin client to the next, but it's a huge gloss on reality if you just ignore the fees and/or risks inherent in actually PURCHASING and STORING those bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-07-05 03:43:26
Incorrect. DCA causes your returns to revert to the mean - basically to move from your EV towards 0. If EV is positive, it reduces your EV - but if EV is negative, it increases it. 
If bitcoin is supplanted by an alternative crypto currency, or if for some reason falls without recovering, then eventual returns will be negative for somebody who invests now and likely/probably less negative for somebody who dollar cost averages. 
Bitcoin MIGHT have a positive expected value - I enjoy watching people debate that fact - but it could easily have a negative expected value. 
That's true of any financial asset, but much more true for bitcoin. As an alternative example, imagine dollar cost averaging into U.S. bonds over 10 years. You'd likely be better with the lump sum, because there's almost a 100% chance the treasury bonds will increase in value. But the scenario where bitcoins do not is much more plausible.

Here's the deal: the regulators aren't a boogey man trying to oppress you - they're government employees hired by officials elected by your peers.
our political process isn't perfect, but AML regulations were primarily motivated by an effort to stamp out behavior society frowns upon, not moustache twirling. 
The gist of AML is "know your customer" regulation. It's designed to stop financial institutions from being able to profit off of illegal activity that others do but claiming ignorance of the illegality. 
Is it perfect? No. Are all illegal/criminal acts worthy of the regulatory state stamping down on them? No. 
But it's childish to get your argument as far as the mind-blowing revelation of "law is a social construct" and then smugly declare AML regs something done "at the whim of the regulators" and it's paranoid to think you might accidentally become a money launderer for "sending bitcoins to your friend."

Greed is fueling this drive, make no mistake about it. People are buying because they expect to be able to sell to somebody else later for a higher price. It's **precisely** what people mean when they talk about things like being fearful when people are greedy.

Have you actually DONE it? Generally when differences like these exist, it's because there are other costs or inconveniences along the way that make it impractical, otherwise it would get arbitraged out almost immediately.

What's happening now is called volatility, not recovery. It's still well under half of its high. The fact that it got to that price meant a lot of people buying and selling, you can't sweep it under the rug because it happened so fast. 
Crashes are also more significant news than whatever happens after them.

Susman is a very, very well known name in legal circles. The firm is nearly without parallel, and they are *very* good at what they do - high-stakes plaintiff's side business litigation, often on a contingent fee basis. 
To give you a real world example - they often pay their associates nearly *double* the (already obscene) market rate of other big corporate law firms via huge end of year bonuses. They only hire top candidates from top schools who have clerked for top federal judges.

The regulations in the capital markets exist for a reason. "hey guys, I promise I'm not going to steal your money, I'm a legitimate business!" didn't work so great. The regulations are focused on disclosure to create a fair playing field for investors and companies seeking to raise capital.
Perfect? Nope. But it's pretty unlikely that there is a large demand for deregulating it, because the regulations *are why people are willing to invest large sums of money.* They know financial statements were audited, they know they'll get ongoing disclosure, they no they'll learn of material developments in the company, and they know they can compare the company to others under the same disclosure regime. 
Lastly, there isn't a *technical* impediment to running some kind of alternate stock exchange with existing technology. You don't need BTC to create "shares" of "stock" for people to trade. It already involves so much trust relative to the entity issuing the shares that there's no benefit to the trustless/distributed nature of BTC as the unit of exchange. 
Colored bitcoins could be interesting for other applications, but I think this is a solution to a problem that doesn't really exist. Love the brainstorming and not trying to be a debbie downer, I just don't think this is the right application.

No, we deserve to be teased for that post getting so many upvotes and cheerleading. 
Investing is not a team sport. Markets do not respond to image macros. 
Each participant should be buying and selling based on their risk tolerance and beliefs. It's utterly absurd to think that the best choice in ANY market is to act like a team or hold together and wait for a price to (rise/fall). All of the strong/weak hand bullshit too - markets move in random walks. You absolutely cannot predict at any point what the best move could be, and the motions aren't tests and they don't create easy opportunities. 
Risk and uncertainty are everywhere.

What you're doing isn't absurd, it's just only partially complete. 
The value of a bitcoin today IS the midpoint between supply and demand. 
It SHOULD be an approximation of the future supply and demand discounted by the probability of reaching that point. 
For example, if you think bitcoin will eventually represent 70 billion worth of currency, then you think it's value WILL equal $6,344 per coin. But right now bitcoins market is badly shunted - almost nobody accepts and spends bitcoin, it's merely a temporary store of value during transactions (through silkroad, via bitpay, etc.) OR a speculative bet on the future value. 
So the current value SHOULD be something like the product of (probability of bitcoin succeeding in the future) and (market cap bitcoin would represent at that point in the future) discounted based on *how long* you think that adoption would take (because cash now has a higher value than cash in the future, for non-deflationary economies). 
You can definitely model a bitcoin's price, but there are enormous numbers of uncertainties, and picking numbers that sound good (like 1%, because how could you get any smaller than 1! or... something...) isn't that meaningful on its own.

Honestly, it's a pretty novel area of the law. 
You have to report as income *gains* in excess of $200 realized from foreign currency exchanges - that seems like the most direct analogue. 
Generally speaking investments are taxed under the capital gains regime, which is itself complicated. The gist is that you pay tax based on the difference between the price you sell at and the price you bought at. 
Of course, if you bought at several different prices, only sell a portion later, etc. stuff can get very, very thorny. 
Generally speaking, short term capital gains (where you've held for less than a year) are taxed as income at your marginal rate, so the more you make the higher you would be taxed. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a more favorable rate - I believe 15%?

Since that looks like a wall of text, here's the **TL;DR:**
1. Sell enough BTC that you aren't psychologically tied to their performance.
2. Invest those BTC in a boring, inexpensive mix of stocks and bonds. I recommend Vanguard Total Stock Market and Vanguard Total Bond Market mutual funds. This is because they're a great and well known STARTING POINT not because they are THE BEST. 
3. Read A Random Walk Down Wall Street. It is not gospel, but it's important information to be *exposed to* at this stage. 
4. Prepare (financially/mentally) to pay taxes on the BTC sold in point 1.
5. Do/research/invest anything and any way you want, but do so from a sounder starting point.

This circle jerk is *madenning.* 
Ben Bernanke probably doesn't think highly of bitcoin, but there is *zero evidence* that he feels threatened by it. 
Assuming that he is is textbook paranoia: believing that higher powers take a deep interest in you and your actions. 
Bitcoin has potential, but right now it's a blip. A fad. A side show. It's simply not on THE GOVERNMENT(TM)'s radar, or the fed's radar, or the dirty banksters' radar.

**No.** It does not mean that at all. You are misreading that text and spreading false information.
*Insured* deposits are up to $250,000 per person, per depository institution. 
The text you posted references **unsecured debt** - which refers to bank bond holders and other lenders, **not** insured depositors. 
Deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit fall into a grey area - while they are not covered by deposit insurance as written, and while you could argue that any deposit in excess of the insurance limit is tantamount to unsecured lending to the bank, historically insurance has often covered those deposits as well, despite not being required, as an assurance measure.

That depends *entirely* on how madoffy the service is. 
Edit to add: they're kind of damned if they do, damned if they don't.
If they DON'T trade the stocks, then they're a scam and will just pay off the early departers with the late comer's money and create fake statements - classic. 
If they DO trade stocks... I can't even begin to describe the world of hurt they're in for. Regulations of brokers are intense, tax consequences of these trades are intense, and trying to get around them by running it out of an individual account through an online broker or something is... laughable.

IPOs generally require an established company. Start ups like this are usually funded through personal investments or venture capital / angel investments. 
To do an IPO requires an enormous amount of disclosure about the company's operating history.

This advice is very misguided. 
Stocks and bonds have fundamentals. They represent an ownership unit in something that is striving to create a future stream of income - profits from business activity (stocks) or promised income (bonds). They are traditional financial assets.
Bitcoins are a CURRENCY and/or a COMMODITY. The future price of those are tied to supply and demand, which are very uncertain, and *not reliably appreciating.* 
If a stock suddenly plummets, there's a decent chance that buying it and holding for the long term will be profitable because the expected direction of the stock is up over time as the business continues to hum along. Now it could be wrong - bankruptcy could be anywhere - but as financial assets, there is an expectation of future growth but an uncertainty of timing and extent.
Not so with bitcoin. You can make arguments for future growth, but they are wildly speculative compared with a business enterprise. And the fundamentals of bitcoin speak to the infrastructure and the technology but NOT to its price. As many are quick to point out, bitcoin 'works' just as well at $10 as at $100 as at $0.05 *as long as there is enough supply to support transaction volume.* A guess as to what transaction volume there will be in the future has massive, massive uncertainty. People could be scared away, alternative cryptocurrencies could come about, the regulatory environment will change, etc. 
"Fundamental analysis" of bitcoin is NOT the same as "fundamental analysis" of other financial assets. It is dangerous to equate the two without further examination.

Individual companies are subject to risk, yes. But a couple of things:
(1) The purpose of a company is to conduct economic activity, grow, profit, and distribute profits to its shareholders. An investment in a company is an investment in its future economic output and growth. You could earn a handsome return just on the dividends even if its "value' stayed flat. And generally speaking, there's a well priced risk premium: the riskier the company you invest in (more leveraged, more speculative, newer, etc.) the more reward you are likely to receive if things go well. Bitcoin is a currency. It only goes up based on the laws of supply and demand, it is not SUPPOSED to increase in value and represents no fundamental economic activity the way stock ownership does.
(2) People who want *safety* in stocks invest in a broadly diversified portfolio. Few people invest large sums in one, or even a handful, of companies. For a few hundred dollars you can buy market index funds that expose you to thousands of companies and their collective economic outputs. 
(3) Stocks are absolutely not thought of as safe investments. Investors looking for safety leave money in banks or purchase bonds (government or otherwise), or else sometimes gold. 
(4) Bitcoin is a very speculative investment. There's so much we don't know - while you can make strong arguments about its strength and likely success, its future is very uncertain. There's no good reason to think it will remain safe long term, but also no reason to assume that it won't.

I mean this in the nicest way possible, but hedge funds are way too smart for this. The stereotypical hedge fund engages in arbitrage that *theoretically* produces returns that have very atypical risk profiles, or are risk free.
One example is convertible bond arbitrage - buying a convertible bond and shorting a company's stock can often produce great yields with a very flat risk profile, but the bonds are illiquid and not available to retail investors.
"Buying bitcoin and hoping it goes up" is not a hedge fund strategy. You may see pooled investment strategies that claim to be investing in bitcoins... but the barrier to calling yourself a "hedge fund" is very low. 
So you might see some pools of money invest in bitcoin, but by and large it's far too speculative to attract large pools of money.

@_date: 2013-04-12 05:32:16
If that's the case, then wouldn't EVERY "transaction" reported on blockchain.info and on listen to bitcoin equal the entire contents of a wallet? 
So if a wallet has 100 coins, and send 1, that would generate a 99 coin transaction and a 1 coin transaction. If it sent 50, it would be two 50 coin transactions. 
I'm not saying you're wrong because I'm neither completely familiar with BTC's functionality nor with how the websites report it. Even if that's the case though, seeing these huge numbers is rare, so it at least means movement in usually dormant wallets, or..?

Bitcoins are nearly useless *right now.* The surge in demand came from people who either (a) anticipated *future* utility of bitcoins would necessitate higher prices or (b) anticipated a rising tide raising all boats, as it were, and being able to turn a profit on the investment. 
The problem is that all of the money that got in due to the line of reasoning in (b) is a self fulfilling prophecy. When people buy *because they expect the price to go up* and it increases the price, it feeds on itself. It works in reverse too though: once people expect the price will fall in the future and sell, *that makes the price go down.* 
Bubbles such as this one can happen in valuable assets with bright futures. 
The future is very uncertain. Once you're in a bad position with a trade, it's impossible to figure out when cutting your losses is smart vs. when holding and hoping for better times is smart.

It's an important distinction, because nothing about bitcoin is revolutionary from a "trade one currency for another" point of view - that has always been heavily regulated due to the potential for money laundering. But there's no evidence that the hammer is going to come down on the currency itself.
To succeed, we either need businesses that aggressively comply with regs - which includes lobbying on the state, federal, and international level - or to come up with alternative paradigms for currency exchange.
