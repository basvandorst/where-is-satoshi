just wanted to share this story to avoid other people to fall in this scam. 
it's easy to get scammed, when you se 4.9 btc for free all your blood drain out to your "&gt;!pocker!&lt;" and start acting less lucid

at that email i replied,  
\[joke\] i agreed but i had to wait my pending payment to reach 5 btc and cashout from their fake website

those 4.9 btc do not real exist, if you deposit the difference you just lose it, becouse their depist addres point who know somewhere else.
they simply stop cashout just fixing withdrawal at 5btc, so when you try the system says, nope you do not have enough funds

ok, i just fixed right now :)
