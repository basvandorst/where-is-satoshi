This bit really got me. How is the govt going to swap their cash for BTC? They will have to use a third party exchange and pay a company a percentage, or create an auction or something -- rather than just take it for free out of their infinite pile of USD. 
Of course they won't pay, it's just interesting that it's hard to even conceive a government having to pay exchange fees to a company rather than a federally owned and regulated bank.

You need to "validate" you bank acct / they send you like 1 cent with a code as the message, it can take a few days.

Yeah, that's why I'm not really too upset -- I understand not having extra auth was stupid. I was running off a brutal password, but that's nothing to a keylogger.

Thanks mate, I'll chuck that info in the police report. I know it's not gonna go anywhere, but it's always good to record this stuff.

I got a virus from Dad's "special" use of the computer. I've just reformatted to Windows 8 which isn't too shabby. 
@_date: 2012-11-01 11:30:35
Only BTC, I play the buy low sell high game, iI had just bought when it bopped down a bit a few days ago. 
@_date: 2012-11-01 11:29:17
Correct.

It was infected through a USB key, I looked closely at it, it had an autorun that spoofed the "click here to open and view files" or whatever in explorer to run a command prompt that launched a java file that was stored in ./$RECYCLER on the USB in a garbage folder. There was a file "a.class" which I believe was the malicious culprit. Malwarebytes found about 6 infections, one of which was apparently a password grabber for web browsers. None of them were keyloggers. 
Now I've reformatted up to Win 8 pro, and am sitting on Avast! free AV. Probably gonna pay for it soon just to get rid of the popups. I'm always happy to pay for something useful. 
Lesson 2: Don't install Java on your windows computer! *Nix only. Too many vulns.

1. Win7 x64 ult
2. yes
3. Firefox with Tor and https everywhere
4. Sophos Enterprise
And yes, I believe it was malware that lead to my downfall.

Support said file a police report and that they can't get my funds back. 
@_date: 2011-10-12 22:15:40
So yeah, it's not just you.

I've got about a hundred. 20 of them are in a wallet, the other ~80 are in MtGox and I'm playing the "buy low - sell high" game with them. Making a bloody killing, two or so BTC a day after fees. I love the volatility.

Possibility of having a dedicated (Live Linux) laptop setup where people can plug in their USB Bitcoin wallets and perform transfers?
@_date: 2011-08-27 07:41:56
There's a chance, in five years either Bitcoin will be dead/close to it OR it will be worth TONS because of our friends at Silk Road who do a great thing for the value of a coin. I'm hoping for the latter ;)
@_date: 2011-09-27 23:14:18
That's alright. But they never seem to have any BTC for sale since the price has gone so low lol. 
When they have stock, they're better than having to pay MTGox fees. 
The cheapest way for me has been to mine them for ages. Been going for about 6 months, massed a few hundred. Don't worry if you're only getting like one every 3 days, it's still 'free' money.

It seems plausible, but there are other places to acquire Silk Road merch. If you head down to the hidden wiki it has a list of about three or four similars, and then if you actually look Tor around there are about 10 or so (that I've seen that seem legit). 
If Silk Road dies, someone would take over.

I watched it. Has nothing to do with the "deep web" but it made its point well.
