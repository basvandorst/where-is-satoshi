Since we are using decimal numbers (eg. 0.0001), I think it's obvious that we are dealing in base 10 here. What I think most metric proponents (those advocating milli/micro/etc) are missing is that we don't commonly use such things when dealing with currencies.
For example, a new car doesn't cost 22 kiloeuros, it costs 22 thousand euros (ie. €22k). Similarly, a mansion doesn't cost 2 megaeuros, it costs 2 million Euros (€2M). 
Everyone knows that k means a thousand and M means a million when talking currency, regardless of whether they understand metric or not. Also, people understand that cents or c (as in century) represent hundredths of a unit.
As such, I personally favor the "bit" proposal (where 1 bit/XBT = 0.000001 BTC), as I think it will continue to make sense as the price tends towards $1M dollars (or whatever price critical mass takes us to).
A new car? 22 thousand bits (22kXBT pending an agreed symbol). A bar of Snickers? 89 bitcents (0.89XBT).
A single, globally recognisable representation between a whole Bitcoin and a Satoshi is needed for mass adoption, not multiple names for different amounts of e^(-something) that only geeks understand because we can't come to some agreement. Something that your common person and financial software could understand would be a nice start.
I don't think its acceptable for people to say "zero dot zero one" or "point oh one" anymore, or having cars costing 0.022-anything, nor do I think there is point waging a metric vs imperial war over currency of all things.
tldr; Decimalisation? Sure, that's worked before and it makes sense. Metric for for lack of a better unit and expecting people who didn't study the sciences in school to understand? Good luck with that.

Try donating some Satoshis to charity to see how quickly a transaction can be seen on the network:
Keep in mind that unconfirmed transactions are exactly that. They don't exist in the ledger until included in a block.
But for smaller transactions, like those at a bar or a restaurant, the flight risk is too small to wait for confirmations. (Hell, they would just leave without paying if that was their intention.)
Especially considering credit card transactions can be charge back weeks later (eg. they take a month to "confirm")

The difficulty of the proof-of-work algirithm is adjusted such that it takes roughly 10 minutes for a lucky miner to solve a block (relative to the network hash rate) and therefore add those transactions within to the blockchain - this is called a confirmation.
The blockchain being a distributed ledger means that everyone works on their own copy, as such it's standard practice to wait a few confirmations to protect against forks (copies of the blockchain that include your transaction but may later be proved to not be legit.)
In short, 3 confirmations means a minimum of 30 minutes or so, assuming you included the recommended fee (otherwise your transaction won't be prioritised, possibly taking hours to be included in a block.)

I can compromise on point 1 of OPs proposal (make "µBit" the official unit of measurement) if you can compromise on point 2 (people will naturally slang the term as "Bit"). Unless we avoid using "bit" in the name entirely, people will colloquially refer to it as one.
Assuming we were to use OPs proposed currency symbol, which I'm not sold on, how would one pronounce µ22k (e.g. $22k is "twenty two thousand dollars")?

Granted, it's unfortunate the metric terminology was already gaining traction before redecimalisation became a topic, and I can see how this could cause confusion if both systems continue to be used.
However, if the decimal place of BTC was simply moved without giving it a new name (as I saw suggested on the mailing list), there would still have been a transition from "old Bitcoins" to "new Bitcoins".
This may be a point we disagree on, but I feel at this stage it would probably be best to drop all the (confusing for newcomers) metric-style conversions, and simply use two things:


Anything else just adds confusion when we could simply move on with ISO standardisation and leave the old system behind without bringing relics of it with us (such as 'mew' and 'you').

Having lived in the UK I would argue that, although aware of millimeters, your average person hardly uses them. For normal use cases, meters and centimeters do just fine.
Even when finer precision is needed, a layperson would rather say something measured 14.3cm over 143mm.
Beyond millimeter precision, one might ask why the fuck you would measure something that minute (outside of science) let alone care that 1000 micrometers makes a millimeter.
But my point is, what does this have to do with *currency*? We can zealot all we want about how 0.001 or 10^-3 of something is imperially known as a metric milli-unit, but people have been taught that currency is represented in pennies and cents since decimalisation took place (with the exception to the Arabic dinar which does use 3 decimal places.)

I feel the point has been missed somewhat here..
The SEC aren't advising against investing in Bitcoin, they are advising against investing in Bitcoin securities.
They are not talking about Mt.Gox (I'm sorry but putting your money in a shitty bank isn't the same as investing, nor are the SEC involved with this), they are talking about the likes of Neo &amp; Bee or the numerous other scams that take place in the Securities section of the bitcointalk forums.
When they mention the facts about Bitcoin being hard to trace, irreversible and lacking central authority, they are trying to say they can't help that you sent your BTC to some company (shares in an unregistered security) and they blatantly scammed you or failed due to incompetence - but without proper financials who would know the difference?
Some people relived the gold rush with AsicMiner, while many others have lost a lot of coin investing in the false promises or get rich quick schemes that some of these stocks promote.
It's funny that people are attracted to Bitcoin because of its decentralized nature and no need for government intervention, yet when they get stung by bad investment decisions within the Bitcoin space they run to the same government agencies seeking regulation.
You win some, you lose some... but only in Bitcoin can you get scammed out of 90% of your coins and still have the same amount of dollars as you started with..

Yes, though I probably made a better argument in [an earlier comment](


Well, let's call it "redecimalisation" then, since people don't seem happy with the current decimal system.
My point, simply put, is:
* the most common decimal systems in use by currencies today have 100 sub-units
* with the exception of Dinar which is split into millimes, these systems don't use metric terminology/prefixes.
See [ISO-4217]( for a list of currencies and their decimal systems.
As for the name ("bit"), I don't really care what it's called though this name will probably have the most traction.

I'm afraid 8 decimal places was a bad choice for metric when 9 decimal places would have made more sense.
People can demonstrate a foot or an inch with accuracy using only their skeletal protrusions but that doesn't mean it's a good way to measure currency.
How about we use metric to measure upward instead to prevent milli vs micro confusion?
Car? 2.2 kSatoshi
Snickers? 89 Satoshis

The way it works is your public key is actually generated by applying a one-way function to your randomly generated private key. So yes, its not only possible (in this direction only) but it's how it was created in the first place.
Not that I would suggest using a brain wallet due to brute forcing concerns, but you can find a public key for a private key using this site and probably others: 
(Obviously, do this with a few throwaway keys to see how that it works. I wouldn't suggest pasting in your real private key for obvious reasons.)

Encryption is two-way by definition, as they have inverse functions to decrypt an encrypted value to get the original value.
You are describing hashing, which by definition cannot be decrypted. It is only possible to find collisions (input values that result in the same hash value).
Sorry for being a pedant, but I hope this helps explain the fundamental difference:

Example: I bought in near the end of May at $125... the price never really went up at all, but instead has been all the way down to $70 since. If I had spent the same amount of cash over 12 equal weekly payments (DCA), I would have 23.17% more BTC. If I had instead only bought enough BTC to meet my weekly target value (VA), I would have 20.19% more BTC.
