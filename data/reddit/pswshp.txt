Thank you!

In every block to mine the random input consists of your own account + the time stamp + the nonce. With the original nonce being 32 bits long, every second your rig had 4 billion hashes to test if their result is lower than the given difficulty level which would mean you succeeded in mining. If your rig was too powerful, you could test all of them faster then a second. In that case you had to wait for the timestamp to change in order to be able to test another 4 billion hashes. It was necessary to wait until the end of the second because otherwise somebody else with a different account could still have been able to succeed in mining within the "current" second where your rig has already finished and in that case you wasted  energy. Of course theoretically a speculative mining was and is possible when you mine with future timestamps.

Mining account would be a special type of account that is accepted by the system to do mining. Like it has been signed by an authority or one of several authorities. It would be necessary becsuse on one hand most people don't care to do it on the other hand non mining accounts would be easier to access.

Then for economical reasons another Bitmain-like company is likely to arise. Since as the mining profit decreases it is only viable to mine with bigger and bigger rigs ie. companies. Of course you may change the mining algo time after time but that yields a general distrust in crypto currencies in the not so tech savy majority.

Interesting! Thanx...

So if Bitmain uses the kill switch they may definitely own over 51% for a few minutes at least once because people mostly haven't patched it yet...

I started this consideration based on that Bitmain is becoming a de-facto authority and then it is better to have an official one whose access would be limited then. But in a paralleel thread my concerns with Bitmain have largely been explained wrong... I also considered a distributed way of granting mining rights ie. mining accounts for example by a rate limited way with a secondary mining mechanism that would forge mining accounts. But that would end up too having an all powerful company forging addresses again and finally owning as many mining rights as necessary to effectively maintain a mining hardware of over 51% block mining capacity --- as far as I get it this is your claim, and it is rather true. Still the meta mining authority together with adjusted block nonces might in fact yield that once a mining account has been mined it remains profitable for most of the time as number of mining rights could have a convergent limit too.

Thanks for all the details!

Does Nakamoto Consensus work without a working blockchain network ie. if Bitcoin were compromised can the community still reach a consensus on a new mining algo or has anything been scheduled for that case yet that the system is still trustworthy?
@_date: 2018-09-13 20:04:13
Except for a random company reaching 51% of the mining capacity? You will soon have to trust them...
@_date: 2018-09-13 20:36:58
How do you cut them off as long as they possess the hardware and only need some new VPN or TOR exits? I'm also curious how a 51% attack can be found out and reversed in praxis? You claim to have a better protocol for p2p decision making than Bitcoin itself...

Okay I wasn't aware that the mining algorithm can be changed without creating a brand new currency.
@_date: 2018-09-14 00:30:44
I agree with your first paragraph's reasoning. About Bitmain's own hashing power as I read somewhere they optimize their shares in selling, pooling and mining which seems fairly logical but I can't personally state it or doubt it.

What is a reorg?
@_date: 2018-12-09 02:16:16
Yeah, my primary question was if there are ways to distribute voting keys, like community detection for example.

Money and reputation have always been inherently exchangeable anyway.
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:01:03
Kind of off topic but relates here: any hints about introducing blockchain based reputation systems? So that no government can intervene on one hand on the other hand there should be several separate reputation lists for different fields of life and all of them containing encrypted references so that anyone can join or leave them and only reveal what is necessary in a particular situation?
