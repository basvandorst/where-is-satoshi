Even if I were generous with my calculations by assuming your node does not use compact blocks / XThin (which about halve the bandwidth requirements, not storage) your numbers are still off by a lot.

You seem to be under the impression that I am angry, which is wrong. I am pointing out that you are wrong about your numbers. If this is only "internet coins" to you then maybe that explains why you can not grasp even fundamental metrics of the system.

I am not hounding you to help me. I already know, and you clearly don't. Look at the fucking charts:
Today it is 149953 MiB, one month ago it was at 144740 MiB, giving a difference of 5213 MiB = 5.09 GiB. This is slightly off from my numbers because block production rate is not constant and there is some overhead with storing the blocks. Stop spreading numbers which are clearly BS.

You can clearly see there are very few. However people there use Bitcoin, often for things like remittance payments.

That site is terrible. Listing services that have *not made any statements* about their support as non supporters is manipulative. Also the list has very few citations. The list is also incorrect, for example it lists Vaultoro as a non supporter, even though Vaultoro is a signatory to the NYA. bitcoin.co.th says "*Our Preferred Choice* A majority of the miners will switch over to using Segwit2X compatible node" but is on the list of non supporters.
If you want to see some better sourced data, you should use 
There it looks like there is more support than rejection of segwit2x, while most companies are still undecided. By node count it doesn't look much though, but I think it is a bit early to call anything.
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:05:21


So everyone who does not share your opinion is controlled by Jihan? That kind of reasoning is just beyond stupid. Do you have to tell that to yourself to be secure about your own opinion?


I guess you never lived in a third world country or know any Bitcoin users from one. I live in Thailand since 2 years and lived in China for 2 years. Both countries have people as poor as that. I know some of them that do use Bitcoin without problem, they use a SPV wallet on their phone. These people usually don't even own a desktop computer. Thinking that any but a handful of them would run a node (doesn't matter if it is Core or btc1) is ridiculous.
To support these people better we should work on ways of making an SPV wallet more secure, but most people, including myself, are fine with the SPV threat model. If you think someone would do a chain reorg attack to affect your transactions, you are quite paranoid. It would have to be quite a big transaction to worry about it, people living on $10 a day likely don't do those.
What people here do notice is that the fees are ridiculous sometimes, and I know a few people who have moved to altcoins because of that.

The current Bitcoin code is a derivative of the original Bitcoin code, sharing a lot of its design. Yes, the code was made cleaner, and there have been things added, but you can't just rewrite stuff and claim that it is yours. That is not how copyright works.

It can definitely still be OSS, so it doesn't have to be closed source. The F in FOSS is a more complex issue though. This might interest you:
There definitely is what is considered FOSS software that includes software patents. This is because some big companies have licensed their patents to **any** software that is licensed under an open source license. I am not sure on the details of only licensing your patents to a specific project as in this case however.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:45:05
No, I am not stupid you imbecile. I just advise people to be careful. Running a node is probably legal since nobody in the US faced legal action for doing so, however running a Lightning Network hub is not the same as running a node. A non-mining node does not transmit value, although it is not so clear with miner nodes, but a Lightning Hub clearly transmits value. The opinion of armchair lawyers without arguments do not change anything.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:45:58


For being a money transmitter you have to transfer value between third parties. Does your node do that? No! Maybe look up what the definition of a money transmitter is before you call other people a moron, prick.


You obviously understood what I said. Our discussion was about nodes, wallets can also be SPV, which are not nodes.


No, it doesn't. Are you saying that a node would require AML/KYC, contradicting what you said before?
In LN hubs will do routing by having funds locked up in many channels. If the hub needs to route your TX then what arrives at the receiver is not your original bitcoin anymore. So in any case, this is differnet than just sending a TX from your wallet or miners including TXs into blocks.
So, yea, conclude from that whatever. I'm not in the mood to argue anymore with rude imbeciles.

Schadenfreude is not something that you are but that you have (source: am German)
Correct would be to say you have Schadenfreude. If you really want to use it as an adjective, you would use schadenfreudig or schadenfroh. You could also anglicize it as schadenfreudy. The adjective form is very uncommon though.
@_date: 2017-09-08 10:09:15
I do all of those and I support 2X. I do not believe in the narrative that a 14% of users activated SegWit through UASF. If it did, then it would be coercion, and not how I think Bitcoin should be governed. The NYA prevented a minority to fork into a chain with almost no hash rate, almost guaranteeing failure. I do believe we should follow through on the NYA, but I am almost sure a new minority chain with almost no hash rate will be created. At that point there will be 3 different chains and the Core version of Bitcoin will need an emergency PoW change hard fork, possibly making it 4 different chains. This situation should be prevented.

According to Adam it should be a landslide win for his side anyway.

Miners *can and do* signal for 2 scaling proposals. Supporting Emergent Consensus does not mean you can not also support NYA. Check the block details on  and note that Slush is the only big miner not having NYA in their Coin Base Text. The number is still wrong though, as F2Pool (IIRC) announced they will not support 2X but are still signalling it.
Edit: Also note that Bitcoin Unlimited as is is compatible with Segwit2x.

While not ideal, anyone can call whatever they want Bitcoin, it is not trademarked, nobody owns the term. The closest we can get is following the definition in the whitepaper. The whitepaper clearly says that Bitcoin is the chain with the most accumulated work.


That is contrary to what the whitepaper says. Miners are the only part of the system that can not be easily attacked as mining requires constant reinvestment. You holding Bitcoin does not require constant reinvestment. You running your node is a laughable expense compared to what miners invest. Holding Bitcoin is very liquid, you can sell your coins anytime, while a miner would be facing huge losses if his investment suddenly became worthless. Therefore it is perfectly reasonable to assume that miners have an incentive to choose what is best for the network. If you want a voice, nobody is stopping you to point your own miner at a pool.


Well, the Sybil resistant poll by Luke isn't any good data either. Excluding huge parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem from voting because they can not complete KYC checks in their countries isn't exactly unbiased. Almost all of Asia (that includes me) can not vote in Luke's poll. Instead if you check out  you can see that they get quite different results and their system is also Sybil resistant.


So, why are those users, with their big "hodlings", not voting on a site like  ? I'm sure you can win easily.

I use two Yubikey NEO and an encrypted USB drive. First I add the key to both of my Yubikeys (which are great since it *can not* be read back). Then I take a screenshot or photo of the QR code and put it on the USB drive. I store my USB drive and backup Yubikey in a secure location. Whenever I need to use 2FA i open the authenticator on my phone and tap the Yubikey to the back (works using NFC) and I get one set of codes.
Of course this works without a Yubikey, just take a photo of the QR code and put it on an encrypted USB drive, store safely. If you use your 2FA device, just go through the USB and add them on another device.
