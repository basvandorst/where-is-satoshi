Guten tag
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:40:49
Duodecimal plz
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:13:02
No, I am not a point. 
My point is that there is more to say than just scream "HODL" willy-nilly to every single sentece written in this subreddit and that it often doen't even make sense, since the person is asking about something completely different from the rich variety of topic and problems about cryptocurrency. It is just a meme now.

Play a record.

Hello, Elon.

@_date: 2017-12-19 19:59:26
of bollocks
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:42:16
This is what I hate. For every interesting, important and well prepared question there is allways the comment that says nothing more than "HODL".
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:48:51
Great. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:40:14
BUT HER EMAILS
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:43:56
For the horde!
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:33:16
I will sell you i5 and 2 grams. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:59:38
HODL, MOON, HODL HODL, MOoon… yeah, get lost, plonkers. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:23:11
Congratulations, mate. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:34:17
What a load of bollocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:25:01
Better check yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:42:24
This is his profit.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:36:13
*looking down from a roof on Central park drinking coffe*  
Sell it all.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:49:47
Anyway, here's wonderwall. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 14:58:39
Yeah, 9… 
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:39:49
He could still very easily troll, couldn't he? There simply wouldn't be anything hidden.
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:05:59
4 8 15 16 23 42?
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:44:15
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:49:34
Yeah, okay, I agree with that, after the bitcoin disappears, it would be good if he would show us the soultion.
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:08:45
Just type'n'try, it's not like there is 480 000 000 combinations.
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:33:51
You forgot the "This is good for bitcoin.".
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:09:51
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:37:31
I will sell you a print of it for 0.004 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:58:51
I'll give you seven. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:54:19
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:56:12
You romantic you. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:55:41
That's a really rubbish piece of advice. I'm sure the price will go back up, but if you are thinking about buying, why should you do it *asap*? It's going down now, just watch the market and wait for a bit, maybe hours, maybe days, but there is no need for rushed decisions. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:26:16
I am higher. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:27:00
Yeah, real fun. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:19:20
Who are these segwit people I should demand?
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:41:53
This is bull-shit.
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:05:41
A pussy with money. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:35:33
He's a redditor. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:42:39
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:04:59
Amazing interview, terrible interviewer.
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:14:34
Hodl does not mean you should not spend them, it means you should not sell them.
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:43:18
23 btc probably. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:13:23
With bitcoin? How does that works?
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:45:59
The USA are a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:38:53
The spike is every time I'm buying. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:21:47
You and your houses.
@_date: 2017-10-15 11:21:33
He would like to take the deal.
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:12:16
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:04:28
Don't die waiting.
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:01:09
*Poor me*
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:42:19
I bought some yesterday.
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:50:42
Hodl does not mean you should not spend them, it means you should not sell them.
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:44:52
He's a jew, innit?
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:51:54
Here we go. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:06:15
I hope he's also a shitposter.
