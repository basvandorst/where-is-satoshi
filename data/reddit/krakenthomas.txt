Please remember that businesses that deal with digital currencies such as Bitcoin are lucrative targets for fraudsters. As such, we take combating fraud on our platform seriously. Our payment partners also require us to to take proactive steps to minimise fraud, and requiring ID Confirmation Photos is part of our strategy to combat fraud. We have found that ID Confirmation Photos are an effective way to curb some forms of fraud and verify the identity of clients.

We have been scaling up support for many months but the growth in demand continues to outpace that. Scaling support takes time. To help see the problem consider this: if you have a support staff of 20 and see a sudden 3x growth in demand, now you need a staff of 60 and have to hire and train 40 more people, which takes time. You can make some support processes more efficient, but that will only take you so far. Slow support response is unacceptable no matter the reason, but we mention the rapid growth just to say that we're up against a difficult scaling problem that's not easy to address quickly.

There was a bank holiday on May 1rst in Germany. All withdrawals initiated from Friday evening on were only issued yesterday. The status changes from Sending about a day after the money went out.

Banks flag us because fraudsters take over people's bank account, send money to Kraken, convert to Bitcoin and try to withdraw it.
