And still does nothing 
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:32:07
its funny given that coincheck state in their security section that bitcoin is stored in cold wallets offline.
which means either they dont do this with the altcoins, or someone at the company with access to the encrypted device is doing the stealing, or they are moving the money for some reason and havent stated why. Maybe they suspected an attack was happening so began moving funds to a backup wallet
nobody knows
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:23:00
they are tracking the transactions on the blockchain.
looks like that much nem did leave the coincheck wallet over a period of 12 - 15 hours I think.
So not sure if its a hack or coincheck had to suddenly move the money for some reason.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:16:35
Sounds like a security attack vector being added.
Bitcoin doesn’t even need to do something like this, the code itself already has the ability to scale if you change it. 
Also, if bitcoin was really still following the white paper this isn’t even necessary. 
This just shows weak as a currency is compared to pretty much all other cryptos who don’t need entire separate networks just to do quick transactions.
The developers turned bitcoin into a store of value so use it like that. Bitcoin as a value store and if you need to actually spend it convert to another crypto and use that to pay.
Decisions have moved bitcoin away from
Possibly ever being s legitimate currency
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:02:54
bitcoin is not a viable currency which is the problem
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:08:25
Enjoy calculating your capital gains and submitting to the IRS for the beer!
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:24:23
we start approaching one world society.
we would in affect have a worldwide currency everyone can use easily and not have to worry about converting from one currency to another.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:14:37
Apple wont go near it.
They like happy customers and given steam dropped it yesterday due to lots of unconfirmed transactions, their fees and how long transaction take and unconfirmed transactions are now well over 200K. 
Apple would not touch this unusable currency as that is what it is right now
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:32:48


because when you use visa, you use fiat which is a currency so works completely differently.
BTC is not deemed a currency so is completely different.
but if you wanna risk getting done for tax evasion then go right ahead!
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:18:16
the problem is also that other cryptocurrencies will be usable before bitcoin is.
so its more likely things like ETH, Ripple or BCH will get picked up before BTC because they actually work quickly for low fees.
Then bitcoin have missed the market
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:19:35
It has long transaction times and stupidly high transaction fees.
You guys even say it’s a store of value over currency right now.
Right now bitcoin is not fit for purpose as a currency. It’s a value store.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:58:39


and thats where i hate that this argument has come
you guys discussed something and you split, that doesnt make other people evil.
the tribalism of crypto currencies is one of the massively shit things about it
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:55:09
not even going to go near lightning on the first version, far too much money that could be lost.
First versions of software always have bugs and security flaws. When bitcoin was cheap fine but now its worth over 10K there is no way im touching it until its road tested for a while and it hits version 2 to know most of the major bugs have been removed.
It also only just hit alpha the other day, its got a long way to go till its released.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:09:27
how was the capital gains tax calculations for those purchases?
I guess back in 2012 you may not have had the same issues with transfer fees and the amount of time but im happy right now to not try and use it as a currency where i can pay almost the same price of the coffee i bought on a transaction fee which might take a few hours to actually be confirmed as legitimate if not days.
there are 91K unconfirmed transactions right now and its only going up
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:19:45
because its the first version that has only just been tested  on mainnet.
It is always the case that you never ever use the first released version of something, especially when it comes to finance because it is bound to have bugs and needs time to mature.
You are not even at the first release yet, just the initial testing in an environment. it still has a long way to being trustworthy and usable.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:44:10
And bitcoin isn’t belittling bcash at all and is a pariah holier than thou subreddit
Both of them are as bad as each other
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:18:49
the number of unconfirmed transactions just reached record highs
its at over 150,000 right now so yea, trying to use bitcoin for doing transactions is going to suck a lot right now
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:17:21
So it sounds like you do a bunch of tax avoidance if you are t declaring anything you do with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:27:50
actually ripple and eth are the way forward
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:10:40
Ecuador people like to diversify and currently bitcoin is an unusable currency?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:37:18
because no one here cares about it being a usable currency
they only care about hodling and the price going up and their memes
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:09:46
But then we have a central DNS registry and the currency isn’t decentralises anymore. You are relying on centralized DNS
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:20:48
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:58:29
which has since been developed on a lot to fix various issues that have emerged.
Bitcoin was also worthless in the beginning so not such a big deal if stuff was not great. when btcs are now worth so much will people want to really risk using a first version of a network where they could lose them if there is a bug undiscovered bug or security flaw?
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:18:11
its what most of the countries are doing right now.
The US does and so does Japan.
They need to figure that out because its stopping it being used as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:48:40
i find it funny because everyone bitched about BCash pumping and dumping yet when bitcoin does it and takes out all the altcoins with it i imagine pump n dumps will suddenly be fine again and lol whats the problem.
because this sub
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:50:59
Because it hasn’t burst
A burst bubble would be way worse than this
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:52:18
Similar to how I’m going to have to rely on big centralized lightning nodes to confirm tabs and add extra attack vectors for hackers by adding a whole 2nd exploitable layer
ETH is obviously not having anywhere near the same issues as bitcoin since it’s already processing more transactions that all other cryptos combined and it’s not breaking a minuscule sweat
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:26:50
not really.
lightning is getting closer but a way off.
other cryptos can process far quicker with less fees than BTC. With all the hype around cryptos right now due to bitcoin, getting on board with being able to accept cryptos by companies will be in business meetings right now.
bitcoin currently not usable as a currency so they will look to the other big ones.
Ripple is proving itself to the banks, ETH is proving itself because it handles so much more transaction traffic than the rest.
BCH is another bitcoin with quick cheap transactions so they may go there as well because it has bitcoin in the name.
Just look at bitcoin right now, its massively stuck with transactions piling into unconfirmed because it cant process anything at the minute in a quick amount of time.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:58:10
Lightning was close 2.5 years ago according to that centralized point of control dev team block chain.
So probably around 5 from now. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:49:23
the dip today was a correction because people realised how fucking unusable bitcoin is as a currency and right now holding bitcoin is pointless.
when it drops 20% in a day you cant even argue its a store of value. People do not want to hold onto a coin they can not use without it taking forever to confirm and having extremely high fee costs. This is why big name firms like steam dropped it as a payment method.
So when you can not use it as a currency and its too volatile to have as a store of value people realise they may as well make their money while they can before it all comes tumbling down.
They will probably wait for all the prices of actually usable altcoins to drop enough to invest in instead.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:58:22
japan is awful at accepting change
business norms are fax and IE still...
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:37:36
I think basically right now, while governments have no idea they are basically going to cash in as much cash as they can (if people actually declare it)
Capital gains on short trading can be a LOT OF MONEY for the government if the trades make millions of dollars.
But for people who aren't going to make those big bucks and actually see it as a convenient way of spending money, its a ball ache to calculate capital gains everytime you buy a cup of coffee and report it.
But if you are someone who is buying and holding to make money, or to use it further down the line, then it makes no difference. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:35:30
because the points they have made are completely valid. why keep pissing off their customers when they have to keep paying absurd transaction fees repeatedly to buy games.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:32:28


is there some slow down, yes
is it not handling over 800K transactions and still not taking around 15 hours to confirm transactions. Yes!
Ripple is the only one being looked at by banks, and is pretty much instant. The fact banks are planning on using it (look at the SBI Exchange whos denomination is ripple early next year) shows they believe and have been shown that it can handle the number of transactions banks handle. So yea its better.
BCH, agreed not many using it but right now it is in a position to handle more transactions more effectively.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:12:29
its partially about the money
mostly a fuck the bankers and bring the people back to the public.
if america was founded today this is what they would introduce as a monetary system
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:57:44
Yes and your income is in bitcoin
And bitcoin is not a currency it’s a property asset and you pay gains on every single transaction
By not doing this you open yourself to a whole world of hurt from the IRS
But hey, if you are willing to risk severe jail time to stick it to the man then go for it
I’m sure your family will love the risk you are taking on ruining all their lives 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:56:03
how was it waiting 20 hours for it to get confirmed?
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:50:22
and that is just as fucking dumb.
IoS has advantages, Android has advantages and arguing is pointless.
However, the difference there is they are well known items that have been in the mainstream knowledge for years so it doens't put people off getting one or the other.
Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash is a new kid on the block which could cost you a LOT OF MONEY if you get it wrong. So its going to keep people away with all the bickering
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:59:08
thats pretty good considering bitcoin is utterly shanked right now
how much was the transaction fee on his part?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:42:31
its coming
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:59:39
bitcoin is not a currency
right now it can not be a currency. its transactions are far to expensive and far too long.
lightning likely will help a bit but that is still extremely far away.
all bitcoin has going for it is the store of value which it was always be, the name and that it was first to market.
Other cryptos will act as a currency much better than bitcoin  but i think bitcoin will act as a store of funds that you leave to make money off.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:20:15
you cant
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:47:46
Getting paid In bitcoin is so fucking dumb
Oh can’t spend it
You would get taxed on every transaction as capital gains
It could be worthless and any moment
It changes value constantly
One of the dumbest things I have heard today
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:28:00
So making bitcoin more centralized via a completely seperate network that introduces more attack vectors is better than making it a bit more centralized using the technology as it currently exists?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:12:30
the fact its not actually usable as a currency?
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:23:37
Or just following a logical way to scale?
Bigger blocks means less blocks 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:28:45
bye bye bubble, time for alts to take over
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:39:12
Or you know, while waiting for a better solution just up the blocksize so you can still actually function as a currency?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:34:49
all completely valid points as to why bitcoin will not be a valid currency for a long while.
its too costly
it takes too long for transactions
it is a value store at most now as its just too much money and time to use effectively at stores. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:47:48
sorry bit lost,
again what is illegal about any of this?
BCH has been poised as a coin that can actually do transactions for low fees and low transaction times.
Bitcoin has been extremely high in transaction fees and transaction times for weeks now and exchanges probably got tired of that shit and now offer BCH.
If you didn't see coinbase offering BCH and seeing that boost BCH you were sorely unaware.
The fact that now bitcoin have reversed their decision on the segwit hard fork now to give them most of the features BCH took on when they split just adds to the fire that bitcoin was behind BCH and BCH did the right thing which is probably making people move over even more.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:51
whats illegal about any of this?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:54:51
you cant even buy stuff with bitcoin right now because it takes far too long to confirm the transaction and by the time it gets confirmed it might not even be worth enough to order what you bought.
bitcoin right now is a piece of trash in terms of being a currency and using it to actually pay for anything.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:54:02
but its not decentralized as it will require big lightning nodes to do it that things have to be routed for.
especially with the fact if its meant to act like an internet for payments meaning there will need to be a DNS of some kind ideally which makes it even more centralized
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:12:02
for the alpha version maybe
an actual release that is good is still WAY off
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:41:10
I’m dead happy
My bitcoin went down but eth ripple and BCH keep going up so I’m still very much fine.
It was about time for a big correction, just surprised the altcoins are still green
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:51:13
well right now it looks like bitcoin is about to take a big correction
people cant price discover properly because it takes so long to do a transaction and the number of transactions are backed up.
some exchanges are suspending trading due to tons of sell orders coming in.
brace yourselves
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:53:26
because the bitcoin network is fucked right now
mempool is skyrocketing, unconfirmed transactions skyrocketing and a huge backlog. you cant price discover because its taking so long for transactions to get processed and now exchanges are stopping trading to allow the whole system time to get through some of the backlog.
i.e. the bitcoin pipeline is currently fucked as its not scalable
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:38:13
but i thought you guys agreed there is no such thing as a fake / spam / bad transaction and all of them are legitimate.
when will this sub stop shifting stances just for convenience
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:17:55
not just bcash
ethereum is way better than bitcoin in its current state and a whole bunch of other coins that can actually handle traffic
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:21:16
and how do you enjoy all your capital gain calculations since its treated as property / assets rather than a currency?
How are the ridiculously absurd transaction fees which on small items can cost as much as the item itself?
How do you like the days for transactions being confirmed (already we are looking at around 91K unconfirmed transactions)
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:39:19
Purely because they aren’t accepted in places yet.
Once ETH BCH get accepted more they will be far more useable as a currency 
That is likely to happen more quickly than the lightning network
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:42:27
Just need to replace IRS with X government entity
The government and banks are still in charge and will get their pound of flesh while they can
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:09:44
why is bitcoin suddenly coming out with all these conspiracy theories and the such
the coin has been crippled for WEEKS 
this is just a market in action and actually wanting to do transactions for sensible prices and times again
There is a reason why suddenly it was announced segwit fork was back on to help with decreasing transaction fees and times because every other coin does not have this problem.
exchanges and people got tired of the shit with bitcoin and moved to stuff that actually can be currently used as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:12:07
and bitcoin becomes like bitcoin cash
are you going to call your own coin trash at that point?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:16:16
Have you ever thought that exchanges finally had enough of the bullshit with bitcoin being unmovable it terms of time and fees
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:53:31
I be fair bitcoin argued about being a store of value once actually doing transactions became a nightmare 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:50:05
but bitcoin isn't meant to be an asset but a currency?
so bitcoin is no longer meant to be a currency but property now to hold money in.
well that sure changed from what this sub was saying a few months ago
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:07:30
there are over 91K unconfirmed transactions right now in Bitcoin and the mempool is starting to rocket up.
It is why bitcoin is an unusable currency.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:06:59
No way is it less than bcash.
How much has been talking about ridiculing the name bcash this week?
How it’s an inferior coin run by evil people?
Most threads have been along this lines in this sub this week.
Thinking that it’s a tiny fraction is laughable
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:16
a bad fork that Bitcoin is now basically copying with the segwit fork its going back to...
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:04
that doesnt really mean anything.
its a milestone proof of concept but the tech is still way too early.
rule of thumb when using a brand new system relating especially to expensive amounts of money. dont use the first version as it will be buggy and riddled with flaws.
test with the first version so you know how to use it, actually start using it on version 2
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:06:48
why is this being a shill?
The transaction problems have plagued bitcoin for weeks and annoyed customers as well as exchanges.
The coinbase listing being a boost was obviously going to happen?
The segwit fork sounds extremely similar to what the BCH fork was. Bigger block size, difficulty reassessment far more often this cant be denied.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:52:21
thats the problem with bitcoin being shit as a currency
transactions are so backed up now and taking forever that there is no point doing anymore until the amount drops
its become literally unusable for new transactions
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:01:03
then how come there are so many threads about transactions taking forever and the number of confirmed transaction skyrocketing to over 200K
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:07:53
So bitcoin is forking to become bitcoin cash basically
So are you all going to call your own coin a shit coin now?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:05:30
i still thinking lightning is actually going to become a centralized mess.
If its meant to end up being like the internet for paying things then you will always end up with big players who own most of the lightning nodes and essentially become like ISPS 
and then to make all this even easier you are going to probably start getting lightning DNS which adds even more centralization.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:52:35
It’s new piece of software that acts as a second layer above bitcoin
It’s a new attack vector people will try to exploit
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:46:31
and it will be MASSIVE
probably take it back down to 10 - 12 K
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:10:31


it shot up a lot in the past few hours.
not the highest its ever been but its growing quite substantially
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:17:34
Because in reality they never are.
For important stuff you use the first version to test with then if you like it start using it proper on the second version
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:46:46
i wouldnt worry about buying bitcoin right now
the whole system is blocked and cant handle the load so youd just be waiting days anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:14:47
And pretty much every other significant country that allows bitcoin transactions does not regard it as a currency.
You have to pay tax on the realized gains
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:41:58
Not really
All my coins are still up around 70% including bitcoin.
Its just a natural healthy correction that was always going to happen 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:40:05
we will see how the alpha does.
bitcoin desperately needs it as it is a pathetic excuse for a currency right now.
just a shame that they had to resort to writing a whole second layer protocol just to make bitcoin usable.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:05:39
Bch is currently down I’m in the hodl game.
Bch has done well recently as well
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:13:07
I did my first crypto investment a week ago today.
My BTC, ETH and BCH are now on my hardware wallet.
i will be putting my ripple in shortly once I confirm some more stuff with my exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:24:37
They can not just tax you for moving it to your wallet. Especially as you can prove the transaction that it was from X exchange to X wallet as you have the address and transaction ID.
Their is required to be a little bit of honesty but that is always required with taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:00:43
this bickering is utterly fucking pathetic.
its this kind of mud slinging between these two that will give cryptocurrencies such a bad name they die.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:26:30
when its actually useable as a currency.
fuck paying and calculating capital gains tax everytime i buy a coffee
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:40:42
looks that way
everything looks like its dropping
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:54:12
Eh I own 0.25 bitcoins in bitcoin cash
0.5 bitcoins in eth
.25 bitcoins
Keeping an eye on bitcoin cash and bitcoin this weekend but hopefully bitcoin cash goes up and after a drop bitcoin does too
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:31:08
I was thinking of buying, but after it dipped it was still up compared to the 24 hours before
I suspect some insider pump and dump happened
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:21:44
Transferring to your own external wallet is fine, that is not a transaction, its a transfer.
my understanding is though any buying / selling with your bitcoin however then becomes a tax event.
Its a pain for making it a usable currency.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:05:34
whats the transaction status?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:54:04
A .sh file you randomly downloaded from the internet
Sounds shady as fuck
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:45:01
I have 0.25 BTC, BCH (0.25 BTC worth) and ETH (0.63BTC worth)
I’m liking this weekend so far
Yes indeed
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:19:51
and its done
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:39:01
i have equal of both so why do i care.
maybe I will ride the BTH high and make a quick couple more bitcoins. Or I could just leave it in both and see what happens
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:40:40


@_date: 2017-11-30 07:02:30
if your exchange diables sales or is down, its pretty tough
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:02:31
well they are not wrong.
you can get a return but i think the return people expect now when they hear of bitcoin (millions of dollars) is going to require significant investment.
if its just to have bitcoin to transact with (Hah due to times and high fees) then its never too mainstream.
if its for making a significant amount of money then yes, its is to mainstrema now
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:34:41
you can mine bitcoin
but you will need a TON of resources to make anywhere near enough money.
You would be better off just putting the electric bills into bitcoin rather than mining
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:10:10
you get taxed on every transaction with it.
So if you transferred it into another crypto, its a transaction where you have to report gains or losses
Sold it back into USD, transaction where you have to report gains or losses
Bought a coffee with it, transaction where you have to report gains or losses
It doesn't matter if when you convert it back to USD and it lives on the exchange, you made a transaction with bitcoin so you have to report gains or losses
Its one of the things holding me back on the using it as a currency. Fuck having to actually calculate all those transactions for tax
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:41:35
Funny that it started dropping when coinbase said it would be offline for 2 hours basically.
All these exchanges are being really suspicious right now
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:00:45
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:50:25
still not there on bitfinex
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:39

In the meantime, I'm sitting here with my 1 Bitcoin I bought split in the following
0.5BTC in Etherium
0.25BTC in BTH
and just enjoying watching the back and forth and price going up.
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:06:33
the constant fighting and talks of civil war and WE ARE THE REAL BITCOIN will as it looks pathetic to anyone thinking of getting into Bticoin
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:33:25
This could be hard to tell though.
For example I bought 1 BTC but on my exchange I could only buy ethereum and BTC with bitcoin.
So for example I now have the equivalent of 1.13 bitcoin 
Of course I guess I don’t really hold 1 bitcoin until I convert those back

I bought 1 BTC yesterday and diverged it into various holdings (0.5BTC in Ethereum and 0.25BTC into BCH)
Already that 1 BTC has become 1.11 BTC!
What is this nano ledger S you speak of? Currently all i do is through the bitflyer exchange so I imagine everything lives there as well?

yea i know it doesn't contain them but im happy to have moved the proof to my hardware wallet straight especially with all the exchange bullshit going on right now.
I understand how public / private key encryption works :D

Poor choice

But the lightning network is such a joke of an idea
The whole point of crypto was the be a self technology not requiring third party tools to Mae it actually work
So you built a third party tool to make it actually work 
Good job

except bitcoin is not instant and cheap to transact with so its dead as a currency

i still love that you have to add a whole new layer of tech to make it work as a currency
this adds more attack vectors for hackers
it adds more complexity to the  whole system
its going to be full of bugs until a few versions up from release
its hilarious that all this is needed just to make bitcoin work like it was meant to

i dunno
bitcoin cash still seems to work pretty well just by upping the block size

and the lightning network brings in points of decentralisation as you are going to have hub lightning nodes that appear which is normal. 
it wont be p2p lightning it will be these lightning nodes that bring centralization.

This was a good piece
it said the benefits
said how it is basically gambling and a speculative place
basically, do you research and dont just jump on the bandwagon. Only invest what you can afford to lose and realise that there is a lot of unregulated bullshit and scams you have to be careful of.
This will be positive overall for the space as it help people hopefully avoid the dumb scammy shit and be more sensible, interested investors making the price of the actual good crypto go up gradually in a sustainable way, bringing it legitimacy.
I was really hoping for Olivercoin though
