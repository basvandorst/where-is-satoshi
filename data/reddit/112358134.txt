I am very glad to see you finally reply here. It is sad that it took so much effort and publicity to get you to reply. But better late than never. We have sent you our BTC address and hope that this issue will be settled soon. I will post here, once it happens.
As a precaution to all your existing customer we will shortly summarise in one sentence what just happened.
Without any prior notice, after several years of stellar partnership, after submitting a very extended KYC, our account was suspended with the reason "internal business/policy decision». We received a reply regarding the release of our BTC several hours ago after this situation became public.
I hope that you will be able to change this approach in the future, so that such situations do not happen again. As for the explanation for your decision it is good to hear it finally and I hope you will be able to do it before account suspension in the future so that both vendors and their customers willl have time to adapt to your decisions.
P.S. Apart from this very strange issue there have been no problems with using CoinGate.

Dear Sidoze,
Sorry to tell you but I am quite sure that the number of 1 star reviews will increase pretty soon to another bar. 
I and the team of website of [cosmicnootropic.com]( have been working with coingate for several years. We managed to get automated unexpired links in emails for payments in BTC so that all orders are marked as paid even is paid several days after creation. It all was very useful for our customers. 
Everything went smoothly and we provided the extensive list of KYC documents to CoinGate just recently until today Coingate simply denied access to the account. And not just that. It did not provide any reason for doing so. It also kept the money of our customers that we did not withdraw. And it even accepted a payment from one of our customer already after it stopped offering access to the website.  
So, I suggest that you try another option because I presume nobody wants to be in a situation when the money is either stolen or access to them denied.
I hope I am wrong but as of now Coingate does seem to be another sad example of a great new type of payment processors that later became fraud :( 
You can see more about CoinGate on our website as we have not yet updated the information on payment. We are very slowly realising what just happened and do not want to believe this. 
Just so that you understand we were onced mentioned on the CoinGate website: [ 
And we also explicitly mentioned how to pay using CoinGate on the website: [
So, guys, think please twice if there is really no alternative to CoinGate.

We just created a detailed post about what has just happened there:

Obviously, we have contacted them several times by now. Even our customers contacted them. 
And no, they did not give us our BTC. There were some delays with withdrawing lately and I have asked them about it but they said it was ok. They also did not reply.
We have been using their service for more than two years. They even featured us on their website, as anybody can see on their website:  
We are not located in the US but of course we also serve American customers, as they can order from us. And we have explicitly said it to CoinGate when they asked 1 or 2 years ago. 
Maybe they don't like what we sell. But we do not know. Because they should tell exactly this and not simply deny access to the account, keep the money and ignore - just look what what they [have sent to us](

Thanks for the reply. Yep, I guess BTC mining is similar to other things in that you need to have interest first so that you can overcome all potential setbacks. I guess, electricity in NYC is not cheap, so it's mostly just for learning for you.

Thx :)

Certainly. Did you doubt about it for a second? :D

OMG, thanks guys. Didn't expect so many comments here. 
But now it is a good place to start.
