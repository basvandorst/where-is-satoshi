I feel you. I've always used coinbase because I don't know that much about Bitcoin... But I tried to buy during the dips at 10k and 15k over the week, and couldn't get through coinbase. It was super annoying and my husband bad similar issues as me... Except none of my attempts got confirmed and it took about two hours for his attempts to go through so he accidentally bought three times the Bitcoin he meant to buy.

I put $20 in every time the value goes down $500, and I'll put $100 in as a bonus at a big enough drop over a few days.

I bought .014 btc in July before the last hard fork on coinbase and there were a lot of posts then saying to get your coin off coinbase before the fork. I ignored them, but now I have even more btc. Are all the posts about getting your coins off coinbase the same nonsense as last time or is there something different going on this time?
I've read a lot of the posts about what segwit2x is and why it's good/bad/the answer to our prayers/a hostile takeover by big banks... And mostly I feel confused. Your post seems totally reasonable and I was just wondering what you think of all the current "get your coins off coinbase" posts right now. I have ETH and LTC too.

I really appreciate your explanation. I'm treating the coins like a better version of the lottery. I put some money in, and tell myself that I'm playing the longest lottery ever. I know that I should spend the time to do my research and be better informed, but it feels hard to find balanced perspectives. Your response was very helpful for me.
