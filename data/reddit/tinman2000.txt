There are several indications that point to Szabo = Nakamoto.
1. There used to be a comment on his bitgold markets blog where he asked if anyone had the coding skills to help him knock up a bitgold prototype. From memory, I’m fairly sure Hal Finney commented in reply. I’ve looked and it appears that this comment thread has since been deleted from his blog.
2. The Satoshi White Paper does not reference any of Szabo’s work. Why not? Szabo laid a lot of foundations, but is not referenced in the White Paper. It’s possible that if Szabo is Satoshi, he didn’t want to reference his own work.
3. Hal Finney coded the Reusable Proof Work part of bitcoin. We know that Szabo and Finney agreed to work on this code together from the original discussion on the blogs mentioned above. We know that the first ever bitcoin transaction was made between Satoshi and Finney. It’s not a stretch to assume that Szabo = Satoshi since both were working with Finney at the same time.
IMO - Szabo was “Satoshi” online presence on forums and such, but Finney did most of the code, based on Szabo’s ideas. In this way bitgold evolved in to bitcoin. Technically one could argue that therefore Satoshi was not one person, but a combination of both Szabo and Finney and maybe others. Therefore, Szabo and Finney were not lying when they denied being Satoshi. Technically neither were, but combined they embodied the mythical creator of bitcoin. Neither could have done it on their own.

Of course it's not real.
This Craig guy is one big sketchy scam-artist from what I can tell. Most of his so-called "companies" don't even appear to operate. For example, an online Bitcoin exchange called "Coin-Exch" - is he for real?? It has no website that I can find. And what kind of name is that? Also he has a Bitcoin Wallet company called "CO1N" which again has no website and isn't operating. Same goes for his Bitcoin Bank and Social Network companies. It's just one big ridiculous scam.

@_date: 2015-12-10 16:16:55
Szabo isn't a coder from what I gather and so he probably doesn't have a deep understanding of the current Bitcoin code. What he excels at is Cryptographic theory and the logic that underpins Bitcoin. In fact, he pretty much wrote the book on a lot of this stuff. He's been out of the picture for a good number of years though.
Also you seem to be forgetting the fact that Szabo might be acting unknowledgeable on some of that stuff in order to throw people off the scent.

1. Sketchy as heck business practices that strongly indicates that he is a scam artist. The administrator report of his failed business makes it pretty clear why the Australian Taxation Office was after him.  - If you look at page 9, there is a description of how Hotwire was funded via bitcoin from Craig, and then used that bitcoin to purchase IP rights from the Wright Family Trust. That trust itself had received the IP from Craig. See here:  - Seems very dodgy. Almost like a bitcoin-powered circular money laundering + tax evasion scheme of some sort.
2. This letter from SGI posted on Craig Wrights website:  - Has been proven a fake:

It seems you don't know the difference between an architecture and a manufacturer or implemention of said architecture. While its true that AMD originally cloned or licensed Intel's x86 designs back in the 1980's, however ever since the 486, their designs have been completely independent of Intel's.
They no longer use Intel designs at all and even use a different instruction set entirely. In the 64 bit era, Intel brought their Itanium instruction set to market first but nobody adopted it. AMD's competing 64 bit instruction set won the war and Intel were forced to be compatible with AMD's designs, which became the defacto 64 bit instruction set.

For domestic transfers, sure, they are cheap or free.
But what if your friend wants to wire money to Germany or India or Australia. Now you are talking about some serious international wiring fees that will cost you a small fortune, especially if you want to send a small amount of $. For example, wiring $10 to Singapore or Europe? Is it cheap, quick or practical? No, not really. It will cost you $20 in fees to wire that $10 and take over a week.
With Bitcoin it will cost you 2 cents to send that $10 anywhere in the world. Oh and it's instant too.

Nick Szabo is American though or at least was based in America in the early 90's. His early postings on the Cypherpunks mailing list were from a netcom.com email address. Back in those days Netcom served the California area almost exclusively and in the days of dial-up, the chances are that he was based in California at this time. 
Netcom started off in San Jose as a service to allow local students access to university networks off-campus, with email addresses in the format of user Netcom soon served 95% of the San Francisco Bay Area.
Of course, it's likely that "Nick Szabo" is also a pseudonym. Possibly, it was the first pseudonym Satoshi ever used. He penned Bitgold under the Szabo name, but for added anonymity he created another layer of mystery with the Satoshi moniker when releasing the Bitcoin white paper.

To the contrary, many things also get cheaper as demand goes up, economies of scale allow mass production of once niche markets. 20 Years ago a PC cost close to £3000. Now a laptop which is many times more powerful can be had for £200. Same goes for LCD HD TV's, Smartphones, Blu-ray players (remember when they £800 a piece and now cost £40??), Internet subscription fees (dialup by the minute) or any other tech you can think of.
 In these examples, demand goes up and price in fact, goes down! Yet we are to believe that bitcoin must keep going up, which defies all the historical examples of mass adoption of technology.

If you default on the loan repayments, how would they get a hold of the bitcoins? They can't seize them from you. And you can't be forced to hand them over.
And that's the reason that nobody is doing this.

Well you keep tweeting about how you wished you had bought $50,000 of BTC when it was $300, but 5 months ago on Reddit when it actually was $300 you were full of doom and gloom about BTC and encouraging people to sell and get out. So I conclude that you're full of shit and don't know the first damn thing about anything.

Don't panic, apparently it's equivalent to about 1 weeks worth of mined coins, so not a large amount in the grand scheme of things.

It creates a fork of Bitcoin, let's called it bitcoin(b). The price of bitcoin(b) starts to drop to zero since nobody will  pay money for newly mined "fake" bitcoins. 
Meanwhile bitcoin(a) and the pools still mining them continue as normal. Eventually the pools who switched to bitcoin(b) will revert back to the true bitcoin, killing off the forked coin. That's why it never happens. It won't work. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:59:12
A couple days ago OP tweeted "BTC: holding for the longest time" and a few days before that he was "HODLER". Then today he was "out of bitcoin" and hoping for a retrace to $400. Strange person.
@_date: 2016-06-20 07:19:59
Bitcoin is irrelevant here.  You need to take this up with your bank. You pre-authorized a third party to deduct funds from your account, in a similar way to how you can add a card to your Amazon or PayPal account. That service got hacked and someone made a charge to your account. Your bank should cover this under fraudulent activities. Like I said, bitcoin is not relevant.

Australia is auctioning off $19m worth of bitcoins today.
Could be something to do with it.
@_date: 2016-06-20 08:41:34
Your definitions of a billion are completely wrong. 100 million is simply 100 million. Not a billion. The standard definition of a billion is 1000 million although in some countries like the UK, 1 million million is also considered a billion. However bitcoin uses the standard US definition which is 1000 million. 
Current market cap of bitcoin is:
$ 11,980,493,282
@_date: 2016-06-18 17:10:12
This is one of the major problems bitcoin still needs to solve before it can go mainstream. Can you imagine people losing their life savings in this way. It's just not foolproof enough. If you put money in a bank, it's still there 5 or 10 or 50 years later, no matter what. With Bitcoin, people are prone to forgetting stuff. There's no password reset function or way to get your money back if you mess up. This is the number 1 reason that will prevent bitcoin going mainstream IMO. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 21:52:51

I would like to think that they would never do that too, but saying they are too public to pull off a scam is very naive.

bitcoinity alerted this as an ATH of the current GBP Exchanges. Since most were only added in 2014 or so.
@_date: 2016-06-17 19:55:31
Yes, pretty much. None of the exchanges, wallets etc would accept those bitcoin(b). Anything mined on that fork would soon be considered worthless since they would be mining 25 per block, but 12.5 real bitcoins is worth a lot more than 25 worthless ones. This is why they continue to mine the true chain.

Most of the time I don't think they are referring to the Bitcoin blockchain specifically. But rather utilising the same technology that Bitcoin uses. This means that they  build their own private in-house blockchain to suit whatever application they are building. I think IBM and some banks are experimenting with this. Since it's private, it's not really a threat to Bitcoin itself.
The "blockchain" has become a tech buzzword that every company loved to throw around in the last couple years without really understanding it IMO.

Bitcoin is at least a 5 year investment or longer. Hold for 10 years, then see where we are. If you were hoping for a short term mega boom, you will almost certainly be disappointed. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 18:25:44
If you mean, increase in supply, can lower the price then yes potentially. Although I believe it is a private auction and they aren't being sold on an exchange. However, it depends on who acquires them and at what price. If they are bought cheap, the buyer could then dump on an exchange which would increase supply slightly. 
However, it's more likely that they will be bought by a bitcoin company IMO to use to boost their own liquidity. Especially if they can purchase under market value, Circle or Coinbase could make a lot of money reselling to customers at a markup.
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:04:08
No, I'm saying there needs to be a solution that's easy and keeps peoples money safe, otherwise the mainstream will simply reject it. Why's that hard to understand? It's not about being responsible or lack thereof, it's about having a solution that doesn't require the user to be a computer scientist.
@_date: 2016-06-18 21:07:00
Actually, the government guarantee an individuals savings against the bank going bust and losing everyone's money (or is it currency?). The reason they can do this, is because they can create fiat out of thin air when required, thus they can replace everyone's money in the event a bank goes bust.
What I'm trying to say is that, to the general public, the mainstream populace of this world: BANK = safe, guaranteed etc. Bitcoin = risky, being hacked, high chance of it getting lost/stolen/missing etc.
Which solution will the public choose? This is why I'm saying, bitcoin **desperately** needs to address this problem!! But keep looking up to the moon with blinkers on, because obviously I'm the only one that can see it's a major obstacle to mainstream adoption! 
How many posts per day are people saying they lost their bitcoin? It's a regular occurrence and everyone in the game right now is supposed to be at least somewhat tech savvy, and yet people are still losing their money on a daily basis. Imagine when mainstream adoption comes and there are people that have to reset their hotmail password on a weekly basis because they can't remember a damn 6 character password. Good luck remembering and safely securing a bitcoin private key or god forbid a 16 word seed! With **NO password reset** functionality! Yes, I really see that taking off! Trust me, I love bitcoin as much as the rest of you. But this is a problem that needs to be fixed.

You don't pay tax on trading secondhand goods. If you're familiar with the good old fashioned Car Boot sale. If you buy something cheap and flip it on ebay a week later for a small profit, do you pay tax on the gains? No, of course nobody does, because it's cash in hand. Bitcoin is pretty much the same thing IMO. Also, if you're trading on an exchange, you're never really going between £ and BTC. Only when you cash out to an actual bank. At which point it just looks like a deposit of some kind.

You threatened them with chargebacks, which you're not entitled to do. You have to file a fraud claim with your bank I believe. It's a different process to a chargeback. Of course they are going to defend themselves if your threaten them with a chargeback duh.
