That sounds really interesting. I've done a little bit of digital marketing on the side for clients back when I freelanced. It's a fascinating field.
I didn't enjoy the series too much up until this one. It's much more open. You basically roam the seas as a pirate. The main story line is there, but you're free to take on side quests or just sail around with your crew and destroy and loot other ships.

Sounds relaxing. I take it you live near a beach? I've dreamed of living near one and doing that.

I'm not that surprised by the number of down votes considering how off topic this is, but hey, I've enjoyed reading everybody's replies so far!

Wow, cool! Those are some impressive looking projects. I believe I've used pineapple.io before.

Cool! Anything exciting you'd like to share? I'm a programmer as well.

I've never been confident or drunk enough to try it, but seems like fun!

Cool, I'm a IT/web app geek as well. Any particular niches really interest you? I find both social networking and financial technology (hence the interest in Bitcoin) really interesting.

How are you redesigning it exactly? Adding new alerts? We use Nagios as well, although I don't have too much experience tinkering with it.

Hah, I obviously have a lot to learn about Nagios! "Inheritance properties" and "templates" are new Nagios terms to me.

I would venture to say that's more likely an exchange moving those Bitcoins than a single person. Either way, seeing these on the Blockchain is always exciting. Cool find.

I totally didn't expect for this to get so many upvotes. I'm really glad it made so many people laugh.

I was watching for $800 as well, probably for the same reason you were. We'll have to wait and see now.
