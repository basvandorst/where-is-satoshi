I’m still waiting.  How’s that analysis going?
I agree it will drop within the next few days, maybe week but your wrong buddy. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:01:00
I prophesize I won’t.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:06:03
Yeah crazy times.  I keep waiting for the drop but it’s been a good stretch recently. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:07:33
Yeah my friend begged me to throw 500 at it when that was 2 bitcoins...my answer was the same “dude it’s already gone up too much, I’m not wasting my money”
Even after today’s crash that’s still massive.

Lol awww.  Don’t worry just repost in a few days :P

Traders gon trade, haters gon hate.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:54:44
Um yeah unless I’m missing something its not dropped yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:26:59
Things like this are the reason I love reddit.  You people are crazy.

Steam stopped accepting bitcoin purely because of the fluctuation. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:18:53
Holy shit what just happened?  
I stopped after about 5...so I can still believe it never ends...
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:01:06
A 5ish percent drop ain’t shit dude.  You said 5 mins too which means you got nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:40:26
So what your saying is you misspoke? We all knew a drop was most likely going to happen in the next few days but you called 5 mins.  
I would change your username to:

Keep one hooker dude.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:52:11
Holy shit I’m not far from being the slightly less flashy version of this post.
New to bitcoin as of about 2 months ago but telling everyone I know about my massive gains.

 Started using cryptonaut yesterday and it’s really sweet.
One thing I like is you can input the amount you purchased and for how much and it will give you profit/loss breakdowns.  Pretty cool.
I think it looks much cleaner than coincap too.

I know every bubble has to burst eventually but personally (and I know this is the same as trying to predict a coin toss) I think we have a while before it dies.  I believe bitcoin has a long term future.  Hopefully we never have a total meltdown that it doesn’t recover from but hopefully the future is bright.
PS what actors?  Not Tom Hardy that guys awesome, he would never lie to me.

I’m in Australia, we smashed 14K today :P
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:52:22
Sadly I’m trying to buy from the one that is listed higher and losing on the difference.  It’s a pretty big difference too!
Oh well it’s not going to make that big a difference in the long run :P
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:16:00
I’m a newbie but as many people on reddit have pointed out we have seen massive drops like this before and always bounced back and then some so hodl like a mofo.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:13:48
Yeah it is I think.  At least I’m viewing it in AUD.  That said I’m viewing both with AUD so still should be about the same.

I hear there is free money to be made in limited edition sneakers!!1!!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:58:10
That’s it, SNODL
Sorry everyone, really sorry.
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:11:50
I’ve been here for years and still haven’t found the normal side of reddit.  Even people doing normal shit are just “normalling” like in 30 Rock.
