Someone with &gt;50% is expected to generate a consecutive chain in private that is longer than what the rest of the network can generate. The 51% pool does this in private, and releases it when it's long enough to reverse anything done in the "public" chain. The 6-confirmation rule is useless in the face of someone with 51% of the hash rate.
So, to answer your question, it's not about any particular number of consecutive blocks that you can find, it's that over the next N blocks (for arbitrary N, like 20), you are expected to generate a private chain longer than the rest of the network.

Please show your work on the lottery question. Let's say the lottery was generating a random number between 1 and a million. You' buy a ticket guessing the number. Are you saying that a person buying one ticket has the roughly the same chance of winning as someone buying 999999 tickets?
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:47:27
What? No they don't... That's the point of hash rate percentage. It gives you better odds at finding the next block. If it wasn't the case, then why bother with all that hash power? Just use a CPU, since you "have the same probability of finding the next block".
Someone with 51% can generate a longer separate chain OVER TIME.  The protocol supports "forks" in the blockchain, so there's nothing preventing two or more conflicting chains. Clients will choose the longer chain as the definitive chain.

We're talking about a double-spend attack, so social structures don't matter here. We're assuming the miner is malicious enough to do this knowing the full consequences. 


The miner still gets the reward when they broadcast their longer chain. The max age is not an issue here, because think about how someone downloading the chain from the first time would react upon seeing 5 year old blocks...


You are wrong. Like in the lottery example, the probability of winning (i.e. finding a block) is the same for any single ticket (i.e. hash rate). But the more tickets you have (i.e. the higher hash rate), the higher the probability of winning vs someone who has less. 


Since I just explained why block-holding can make sense, this isn't a valid explanation anymore, right? By the time people notice, your attack would have worked. 


Not a risk, because you are guaranteed to have the longer chain after some time.


Are you saying that you'd EXPECT someone with higher hashing power to take longer to get 3 blocks in a row? From that progression, would it take even longer if you had 99.9999% of the network to find 3 blocks?
@_date: 2014-01-17 00:26:13
There's a maximum difficulty, so yes, assuming you had some magical device that can find hashes instantly even at maximum difficulty.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:34:34
Well, the key is that the 51% is malicious, so they only build on their own blocks.  Then it's like two cars racing. One averages 51mph, the other 49mph. Maybe in a few minutes, the slower car is ahead by a reasonable probability, but over a few hours, it's very unlikely (poisson distributed) that the slower car is ahead. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:40:58
Why do you think it's 10 minutes only? Why prevents someone for  releasing their private chain after mining for a day? You mention massive risk, but what are the risks, and what causes those risks to occur? 
Probability and odds are two sides of the same coin. You need to clarify how you can change the odds of something but not the probability. In bitcoin mining, the probability of finding the next block is the percent of the hashing rate you control. That's the number that matters, and not individual hashes. If the 51% worked on their own private branch, do you agree that they have higher probability of having a longer chain as time increases compared to the other miners? If no, why? If yes, then since the probability increases with time, you'd agree that it's possible the miner has &gt;99% chance of generating a longer chain within maybe 1000 blocks?
Do you think it's not possible to broadcast a very long chain to replace another chain? If so, what is preventing that from happening? You keep mentioning "next block", but not why  it is significant. Why can't it be 2 blocks? Or 5 blocks?
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:28:13
Well, since you would only be building upon your own chain, the answer is 100%. A better question is, after you have mined 3 blocks, what's are the chances that you have mined a longer chain than the rest of the network?

You create a new address for every buyer, for every transaction.
@_date: 2011-06-03 20:44:23
1. If say 99% of people (weighted by computing power) stopped mining, then it will take 100x as long to solve a block. Since difficulty is meant to make it so that on average, given all the computing power at the time it was raised, it would take 10 minutes to find a block. 100x 10 minutes = 17 hours, and so it'll be a looong time before the current difficulty will be adjusted.
2. When the difficulty is adjusted, the most it can change is either 4x or 1/4. So it will only make it a little easier.
Of course, it's conceivable that the network will have a consensus to decrease the difficulty through an updated client.

It's a single transaction, but there is another issue with having to join lots of transactions. The size will be pretty large, and you'll need to pay a large transaction fee (0.01btc per kB).

Transactions are fully spent. There is no "money left" in a transaction. In this case, it will be:
Inputs: (transaction for 50btc), (transaction for 3btc)
Outputs: (53btc to target address), (2.99btc to a new address to yourself)
Note the missing 0.01 btc. That's a transaction fee. Anything that isn't sent to an output is considered a transaction.

Quickstart guide:
    1. Download guiminer: 
    2. Open guiminer. See the server dropdown? Pick one (other than "solo" and "other"), then click the link to the * website on the right.
    3. Create an account on the pool's website.
    4. Back to guiminer, enter the your username and password.
    5. Select device, which should be your GPU.
    6. Press start mining.
You see, you don't even need the bitcoin client to start mining. Your earnings will just accumulate in the pool's account until you tell it to pay out. Since it'll take most people at least a day to earn even 1btc, you can take that time to learn about how to get paid, what workers are, what a bitcoin address is, and various ways to optimize to get faster hashing speeds.
@_date: 2011-06-22 23:03:17
Thanks, that makes sense. When you say "the second one to arrive", where is it arriving to? Would the transaction actually propagate through the network, or would nodes not forward transaction messages that they think are invalid?
@_date: 2011-05-30 03:00:03
There are parts that I almost never see explained, and one of them is how the network decides which transactions are in a block. (I'm guessing either by transaction time, or by transaction fees+transaction size).
Another thing that I rarely see explained is how transactions fit into this. Essentially, you can consider a block as a summary of some transactions. Each transaction is hashed, and several transactions are hash together using the "merkle tree" that you hear about. The final hash that makes up all the transactions is the merkle hash.
Now, the FIRST transaction in the block is the transaction that gives you the 50BTCs. It's actually a transaction that you make yourself, and that all clients agree with. It's also where the "extranonce" part comes from. When you increment extranonce, you are changing some part of the first transaction. This changes the merkle hash, which is part of the block header.
And finally, a transaction consists of a single input and multiple outputs. The input/outputs are bitcoins addresses, and there's some validation that ensures you can actually  send money from the input transaction. In the case of the 50BTC transaction, the input can be anything. That's the extranonce.
@_date: 2011-06-03 21:21:55
The thing is, no! You just need an address.  When you start up your client (after many months of not running it, for example), the bitcoin client will auto-discover transactions that belong to you.

Having a central bank is not required for frb. It's perfectly reasonable that a bank can have a shared wallet of all deposits, and lend some of that out for interest. There wouldn't be enough bitcoins in the wallet to cover everyone's account, but that fine as long as most depositors do not withdraw all their money.

Banks also cannot create money without removing money. If they give someone a loan, then there's a liability in their balance sheets that at least covers the amount loaned out. 
FRB with bitcoin would be done exactly the same way as private banks would do it (with no central bank). All funds go into a shared wallet (the reserves), with the depositor being guaranteed access to his funds (depositor funds become the bank's liabilities). The bank would lend bitcoins from the shared wallet to borrowers. The balance sheet of liabilities + reserves - loans should equal 0, just like how a bank operates.
So, how is any of that not fractional reserve banking? The bank's reserves &lt; bank's liabilities. If you don't think that is fractional reserve banking, then I'd like to know what you think FRB is.
With a central bank, it only slightly complicates things, because the central bank has the ability to create money, but a central bank is not required for FRB.

One way is to use "importprivkey" of the satoshi client.
A second way is to use blockchain.info wallet to import the private key. (Import/export, import private key).
Both of those ways will make the wallet find the transactions for the corresponding public key. And you can spend that money now with the private key (technical detail which most users do not need to care about. Just spend it you normally would)

1. New blocks contain transactions that have yet to be included in a block.
1. Transactions included in a block are "confirmed" (it's actually stored in the ledger of transactions, rather than floating around the network)
2. Blocks depend on a previous block, so blocks form a chain. 
1. Blocks are hard to generate, so transactions within a block are trustworthy. And since they form a chain, the more blocks there are, the more trustworthy a transaction is.
1. If blocks are never solved, transactions are never confirmed.
1. The incentive for someone to solve a block is the block reward.
1. The incentive for someone to include transactions in that block is the transaction fees.
So solving a block is both good for the network (confirming transactions), and good for the person solving it (the block reward and fees).

I think you want to clarify what you mean by "destroying" the coins. Do you mean completely wiping it out from history? Obviously that can't happen since it's on the internet.
Do you mean that you want to destroy the LINK to future transactions? Then you can use a mixing service, or find a miner willing to swap freshly minted coins with you (for a fee, as you can imagine that they are very rare).
There's no reason why freshly minted coins can't be tainted as well. The government can say "only coins from these miners can be used", then suddenly your "Fresh" coins are tainted.

I've tried looking for it, and my conclusion was that it isn't available from the client, and you'd need to scan the blockchain yourself. The client does the same thing when you do importprivkey. Blockchain.info has a reverse index to do quick lookups of address to transactions.

Splitting it is recommended for anonymity. If they're already in a single address (or coin, which you keep using incorrectly...), you'd need to mix them.

You are not correct at all. There is no "last block" to be mined. If there were no blocks, then no transactions would be confirmed.

The bank wouldn't have to store your bitcoins in an address that belongs to your account. They just store it in a computer database that says how much bitcoins you have. 
Since you and everyone else is very likely to never take out all of their money at the same time, I can lend out some of that to other people. I no longer have the full reserves of everyone's deposits (rather, I'd have a FRACTION of the RESERVES). In return, I pay every depositor a little bit from the profits of me lending out their money.
Suppose suddenly everyone took their money out. I no longer have the full reserves, so I need a bailout. Thankfully, I have been paying insurance to a company just for circumstances like these (along with all banks), and the insurance company DOES store their bitcoins in a less risky way than the bank. That insurance company is able to pay back everyone's deposits.

And you'd know if you were pool mining if you provided a login/password to bitminer.

Can I buy 1 ounce of gold from you for 1 BTC?

Yeah someone said that bitcoins were digital, but then I go on local bitcoins and they expect me to hand over physical cash to get a digital currency? What are these people up to? Why would they say bitcoins are digitally exchanged when I had to use physical money to exchange it?

Then the miners aren't just choosing to exclude a certain address, they're excluding other miners.  Then yes.  But that kind of collusion is more harmful than simply excluding an address.

Fractional reserve banking is possible with bitcoins. Once it enters the bank, it is just numbers, and the bank can lend out bitcoins while still keeping a fraction of the clients reserves for withdrawal as required by law.

You may have a fundamental misunderstanding of probability, or a misunderstanding of how SatoshiDice works. SatoshiDice does not have the future outcomes stored (what you implied by the list of 100 flips). Every outcome is calculated when a transaction is made.

Implying you haven't spent all your USD buying bitcoins so you have no money left to buy when the price falls suddenly
Implying you are willing to sell near the top of the fall so you have money to buy when the price starts rebounding.

It follows that if you could turn any phrase into a 256-bit number, you have a private key, and therefore the public key. SHA256 conveniently turns any phrase into a 256-bit number.
 also has functionality for this. You can check "Wallet Details" and input the smallest valid 256-bit private key: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001

Infinity and infinite are just concepts. They're shorthand for a more comprehensive definitions applied in context. If you want to use infinity as a number, you'll need to define a system of axioms where you could. More realistically, humans have well-defined concepts of infinity that is well accepted in reality, and none of them include how you are using it.

This isn't a discussion on whether or not it's right for the government to have an estate tax. No matter what your opinion on that is, it doesn't mean it's not tax fraud by hiding assets that should have been taxed.
By all means, hide your tax burden if you like. Just don't pretend you're not hiding your tax burden, because you're just lying to yourself.

Minimum target is 1, but the target is not the number of zeros. Hashes can be interpreted as an integer, and the target is saying "hashes at or below this number is a valid block".
You may see references about proof-of-work and "hashcash", and hashcash uses zeros. Bitcoin took the proof-of-work from hashcash and uses just a number rather zeros.
