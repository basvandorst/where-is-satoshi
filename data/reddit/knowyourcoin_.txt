You say “shirts”, as in plural, but I only see a single shirt design...

I heard the CIA use bitcoin to pay mercenaries to do their dirty work

Bitcoin isn’t tangible, so it’s never been limited by the physical constraints that paper money has had to endure it’s entire life.

Cryptocurrency is a huge threat to fiat currency and at the moment these “financial experts” will take any opportunity to create FUD across mainstream platforms.

Well good luck to anyone who was laundering money last week and lost 30% in the dip...

“Patrick K. Mcdonnell and his company Cabbage Tech. Corp., doing business as Coin Drop Markets (CDM).”  When a dude named his company ‘Cabbage Tech’, people might wanna think twice before giving him money...

You get karma by doing good deeds. Like giving up your seat for elderly people or a pregnant woman. Or taking your shopping trolley back to the bay instead of being an a-hole and leaving in the car park. Or holding a door open for someone who has their hands full and would otherwise struggle to open the door on their own. Or just saying please and thank you when you’re at a restaurant because waiters are human beings too. 
Basically, you can earn karma by not being a douchebag in this world.

Over an hour to explain how they work??
That’s almost as long as it takes to process a real transaction...

I wouldn’t be surprised if Warren Buffet actually has Bitcoins. Every time a news article comes out with quotes from him regarding bitcoin the price dips, and then rises back up.

You’re talking about things that have had some sort of corporate greed and/or manipulation involved. That’s why bitcoin was started just after the 2008 crash because people had enough. And that’s why more and more people are behind decentralized commodities and peer2peer earning.

And Bitcoin is +1000%? ��

Three cheers to those who just kept hodling and didn’t let any sharks take their coins for cheap!

Why is it always old blokes with grey hair who go crazy with words like “useless” when they talk about bitcoin... don’t they remember when they were young and older men used to call computers “useless”...

I’m not a religious person, but you gotta have faith in your crypto. If you can’t believe in something you put your hard earned money into, then why even bother?

What if.... people are crashing the Bitcoin price just so they can recycle memes? ����

Imagine if cash was actually replaced by crypto. No more petty cash robberies. Crims are gonna have to go to MIT just to rob a corner store ��

Most important rule of crypto - Don’t ever give out your private keys! Duh

I told this IT sales guy at a Computer store that I wanted to build a mining rig to mine Monero because I saw it had potential on the darknet and figured if more people started using it instead of Bitcoin then XMR prices would go up. At the time XMR was still only about $25. He laughed at me because it was going to end up costing me more in power costs each month than profits made by mining XMR at the rate of $25 per coin. I told him that it would definitely go up at least enough to make me a little profit (but didn’t think it would go up 10x in less than a year) and I even suggested he buy some XMR.
Not sure what that IT Sales guy is doing now, but I’m sure glad I did something crazy and stupid by believing in Monero.

And? You must take your private keys to the grave! Duh
