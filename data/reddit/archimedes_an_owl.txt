What do you mean by that...
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:49:52
I’ll take your money since it’s “meh” to you if you want. Just to help you out ya know
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:42:03
I 100% agree. How long does this first movers advantage last though? It would be better to nip this in the bud before it’s a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:40:52
Obviously I didn’t move it, that’s a huge waste of money. But that was the cost. 
Definitely is not the most secure nor the most anonymous coin out there. It has the best support and attention, sure, but not the best security. 
We are on the same side dude. Can you honestly say you don’t think BTC needs improvement?
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:08:28
I just paid $16 in fees to move $3. Bitcoin has had forever to improve. If we take too long to improve our competition is going to start creeping up. 
I guess my question to all you bitcoin pros is: what can everyone do to help LN happen? What can do do in general to help BTC? Other than making a node (which I’ve done) is there anything? I don’t want to see BTC lose to some alt.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:00:02
PLEASE let this happen
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:07:38
Exactly. Bitcoin is great and has come a long way, but there are a few things it needs to do to really become the undisputed king 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:41:31
WOW MEME CURRENCY������
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:24:23
These are so not funny. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:00:54
Lmfao she’s so stupid!
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:05:32
All in man. 2 years later you don’t wanna regret not putting in that extra $500.
That’s where I’m at right now (except I put in none 2 years ago and now I regret it lol)
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:40:39
@_date: 2017-03-04 06:58:53
God lol what is HODL?
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:14:28
Ahhh... I see haha thank you
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:00:53
Is the hardfork a good thing? (For Bitcoin price, that is)
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:22:21
Damn well thank you for all that. Extremely helpful. 
Are you selling right now and buying back later?
@_date: 2017-03-04 05:10:33
Ah yes that is quite the real fear
@_date: 2017-03-04 06:59:04
Hold on for dear life... Lol never mind
@_date: 2017-03-04 04:41:06
FOMO? And damn nice!
@_date: 2017-03-04 06:49:13
Don't you feel like less prominent crypto currencies are going to die off in the wake of Bitcoin though? I did buy one ethereum though just in case haha
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:11:52
Been reading them, but everyone has different opinions and there isn't really one answer. In case you were wondering your response was not helpful at all.
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:10:34
Thank you so much for this☺️
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:52:49
Thank you for the sell, that's why it went up. Seriously tho why would you sell
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:43:16
Wow very helpful, thank you bunches
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:01:40
Dude link your bank account. I paid only $48 for a $3000 purchase or something. Bank account is significantly cheaper
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:35:52
So I've unfortunately been at work for like 60 hours straight (happens once a year lol, literally the most inconvenient time ever) and have very little idea what is going on now. I know the fork or whatever was supposed to happen today or did and BCC or BCH is being mined at the moment(?). 
If someone could give me a day recap that's super short that would be amazing haha... so sorry all!��
P.s. It was my understanding that when BCC became a thing, it would split from BTC and take some of the value from it (like, hypothetically BTC is at $3,000, the fork happens and BCC is at $200 a piece and then BTC is $3,000-$200, or $2,800. Is this true?
So sorry! Thank you again haha
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:26:55
The memes aren't what I'm excited for about 9000 lol
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:20:33
If you remember, he had a terminal illness so I don't think he had a lot to lose. Again, he made a correct decision, you didn't. Don't hate on him for having balls, believing in bitcoin, and being fucking loaded.
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:32:54
Yeah like I said, some decent points. Maybe. Obviously that was not one of them lol
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:58:43
Hodl onto your butts*
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:34:55
YES YES YES
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:48:05
Dude he probably did a lot of research it's not like he was like "oh bitcoin, seems cool, let me buy lots" 
Either way, who's the stupid one? He has 600k+ and you have...
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:48:07
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:12:47
I never said it was new news. I only just learned that and having been with Coinbase for awhile now I figured I was not the only one who didn’t know
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:23:31
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:16:04
But what about futures? I think this spells doom for btc to be honest...
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:07:06
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:47:00
I hope you keep that mindset when a correction happens. It's pretty scary 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:35:43
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:31:00
Good thing you just told everyone 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:19:28
We all knew it was going up. He's not an idiot
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:48:59
Thank you so so much
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:45:01
Please sticky this
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:28:00
This guy infuriates me to no end 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:35:45
If I had money I’d give you gold lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:47:05
I’ve been paying $0 in fees...
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:54:50
What a fool lol what do you think he’s making them as art?
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:12:20
Why... it was hardly funny/amusing the 2nd time. Please stop 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:22:14
If someone hadn’t made this comment I would have 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:01:30
Repost af
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:00:53
I’m lovin’ life
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:50:18
Blatant repost lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:44:48
Why do you do that
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:09:54
Thank you! Very helpful
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:36:09
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:51:16
Stop this please
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:57:05
Ah okay. Yeah I have like 3 litecoin and .01 bitcoin haha so that isn’t a problem for me, but I can see why you do it (if you have more than me)
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:29:01
Ha thanks I forgot to add the link
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:42:39
Okay, maybe not to you, but to some yes. If everyone didn’t share information they already knew what would happen? Why don’t you leave kid
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:54:57
"this guy is an idiot" 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:53:55
Mmmmmmm nope
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:51:14
So how are they not the same thing? It appears if I do a sell limit at $8900 or a stop loss at $8900 they would both sell my specified amounts? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:21:30
What movie is this
@_date: 2017-04-26 13:03:38
Coinbase is amazing. I'm pretty sure they are one of the more highly suggested sites
@_date: 2017-04-26 12:58:33
Dude call them. Call Amazon. Their customer service is great. They always help me and if you tell them what happened of course they will fix the issue. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:19:55
Also, what is Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:37:34
So is 2x confirmed?
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:08:58
I think you'll like 1 x Silver/Gold Plated Bitcoin Coin Collectible BTC Coin Art Collection Gift Physical  JEF. Add it to your wishlist!
Looks pretty shiny to me man... maybe he saw one of these walking by...
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:05:28
I'd put $9 into btc and $1 into bitcoin cash (bcc) just in case haha. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:00:04
My recent buy from coinbase is finally available in my account... I was about to transfer to my wallet so I had the keys to both. Is it hopeless now? To get BTG?
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:19:09
Is segwit2x happening still??
Also, in a short summary, what would happen if all of the miners stopped mining bitcoin (maybe for a more profitable crypto)? Also, is the problem with BCC still happening where miners switch back and forth between the two? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:45:59
Buy $200 now
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:36:37
Even though it's dead, will there still be a split and a coin created?
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:48:09
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:19:54
When you say that someone can flee their country and access all their money from a wifi hotspot, how could they do that? The only way I see is by having their money on an exchange, is that what you're talking about?
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:40:35
Even though it's dead, will there still be a split and a coin created?
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:34:42
I bought at $1,700 instead of $1,560 and I thought I was a fool
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:12:05
This is how you create a node? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:37:54
Thank you very very much!!
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:15:22
Don't forget about, "guys can we seriously stop posting so much of x related posts?"
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:32:13
How many blocks do we mine per day?
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:08:05
Wow very helpful thank you! And so anyone can make their own node? Do you need any special hardware/software to do so?
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:30:47
That is wrong though. It says it's 5964 but it's $6,040...
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:38:21
Even though it's dead, will there still be a split and a coin created?
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:36:49
It's not happening November 1st??
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:07:36
I'm no average 5 year old
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:11:33
Is one wallet better than the other? I'm currently using a trezor as well, but if the core nodes wallet is better...
Also, the reason why I want to make one is to be a team player. Like most of you (I think I'm still fairly nooby on the nitty gritty bits) I am pro-core so I just want to do my part.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:10:12
And two different coins?
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:37:54
Even though it's dead, will there still be a split and a coin created?
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:12:43
We should be friends 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:36:09
But we aren't getting the segwitx2 coin until November 16th, right?
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:37:43
Even though it's dead, will there still be a split and a coin created?
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:55:31
Yay! Free money for us and Bitcoin treks on!
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:24:53
Didn't he buy 91 coins? ATM that's around $27,000! What an excellent decision
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:05:48
Wow thank you so much for all that! Very very helpful! 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:48:52
What the hell is going on with bitcoin??
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:12:37
91x300. It was essentially 2,300 when I posted that. 300 growth times 91 bitcoins is ~27000
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:44:28
No clue what that means, top level comments. But yeah seriously that's like $4,000 a day����
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:01:04
What does that mean? 
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:01:34
Wow thanks man! 
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:44:45
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:23:05
POKE! Poke af
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:38:38
Heeeellllll no! This is the best thing to watch ever!! All the times I wanted to sell and didn't just makes this show that much better! Congrats all you bitcoin owners!
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:24:59
My limit is $7,500... idk about 300
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:47:18
Anyone wondering about the guy who took all that money out of his house and bought 91 bitcoins? Boy he must be happy right about now 
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:10:28
Yes!! Thank you so much!
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:17:33
For me it's like $6,000/10,000 
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:54:33
authy? What's wrong with the phone number as well?
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:34:51
When will the fork be over? Like when wil I have keys to both my BTC and BCC? 
@_date: 2017-07-04 22:02:19
Gold plated iron
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:43:00
Who? Chie or me? My math is spot on (assuming bitcoin has gone up $300 since he bought it)
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:00:09
You mean log in info and such? Definitely not. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:14:26
Really...? Do you actually think that 
@_date: 2017-06-22 01:41:05
Wow thank you so much! Very helpful! What are you going to do and when?
@_date: 2017-06-17 02:21:53
Wow... this news is REALLY exciting me. Thanks a lot man. Why will segwit cause an initial crash? 
And is there a reason ltc will take off? Or just a guess? I have 12 but if there's an actual reason I will buy more as you suggested haha
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:38:45
So no more anticipated price drops in the near future
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:22:50
Haha seems like a solid strat... I think. Do you think Ltc will take off? Also, why cash out in early July? Thanks a lot haha
@_date: 2017-06-22 01:42:20
I was simply told this by someone which is why I asked. Also, yes, hence the fact I said I would sell earlier than August 1st
@_date: 2017-06-22 01:44:37
Will bitcoin's price plummet August 1st?
Should I sell alt coins as well as my bitcoin on July 10th?
What are you doing? 
Sorry haha:-)
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:12:14
No:,( I know it's vague but it was posted Monday or Sunday and it was about 16 mins long. Thanks everyone though!!
