Nobody's reading that shit and I'm sick of scrolling through that nonsense.

Holy shit!  $10,600.

Dude, I woke up and saw that and my first thought was pull that shit back.
But I didn't.
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:33:58
I didn't either.  Just dumped right in.  No regrets.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:29:14
LOL.  Wheeeee!

If it's the former, it's pretty scary.
And tiresome.

It's that simple.  But be careful.  I found transacting confusing with them.

It's easy to convert to Coinbase Pro.  MUCH lower fees.  I set it up and transfered my coinage in like 5 minutes.
Highly recommended.

F5 Friday!!!!!

It does.  but this weekend is different as it hit hard yesterday.  This weekend will set a base and it will rise from there.  
This go around is much more grounded, IMO.  Much larger and more resistant to major drops.
But watch it closely!  :)

Man, I only bought in late last week.  And it's a significant amount to me.  
What does this mean?
