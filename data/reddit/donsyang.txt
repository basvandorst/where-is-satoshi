Alright thanks
How can i send btc from a ledger if it will not confirm? I cannot adjust the mineds fee do you have any tips?

I have received a lot of private messages to push transactions. It is very busy and fees are getting higher. I am working on the development of a simple site where you can re-broadcast your transaction to the network for free. I pay the api and host myself, if you want you can donate me so that I can realize this even faster. Send me a private message if you want to donate something.
You can also do this yourself at  the disadvantage of this is that only 100 transactions per hour can be pushed.

Your miner fee is very low, it will probably take weeks to confirm your transaction. I will try to push your transaction. PM me for more details

really ridiculous how bittrex deals with her customers. This company must be brought to justice, hire a good lawyer.
