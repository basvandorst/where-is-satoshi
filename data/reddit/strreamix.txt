The whole crypto market was completely overbought with dumb money and it's returning to more realistic values. My 2 cents.

Some serious delusion going on. Hope I'm wrong for your sake.

I don't have 4000$ to hodl. My plan is to make 50$ a day until I can make 4000$ to buy 1 BTC outright. Obviously this may be a longshot, but my questions in the topic remain accurate to my purpose. And if one day it drops and my 4000$ turns to 3700$, I'll sell and cut my 300 losses nbd.
Make no mistake, I want to HODL, I want to badly. Send me 1 BTC and I swear on my life I won't sell it for cash. lol (unless 1 BTC hits 30-50K then I'd have to reconsider). With that joke aside, I'm trying to figure out a way to earn my 1 BTC.

Shouldn't there be more information about x2?
Arent some of you afraid that BTC will be abandoned for B2X if 80% of the hashing power is going to be used on the forked network. I'm surprised there isn't more discussion about this.

For Bittrex I believe you need to turn USD into USDT first.

Like selling the coin for 1$? I don't expect to make a typo or noob mistake. I'm asking realistically in terms of my expectations assuming I do everything correctly.

4 business days for that transfer, much better, thank you. Still wish there was a better way.

I am already verified. Still taking 11 days.
