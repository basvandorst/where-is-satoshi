Why would you not want to buy other products? I think this is silly it's like the btc pizza he didn't lose anything he was going to buy the pizza either way. People are impulsive everyone isn't going to horde their money so they can get x% next year.

Lol toxic culture if you don't feel safe keeping your investment you've already made the huge mistake of investing more than you can afford. Also no one is shaming anyone it's fucking memes untwist your panties.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:47:55
If you're putting rent money into any investment you need to stop. Crypto is highly speculative, and should be treated like penny stocks ATM. In the future it will be more stable but right now the pool is way too small.

Wut there was like a 3 year bear market after mt. Gox I mean yeah it's still uncharted waters but to say it's all been sunshine is ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:21:19
It's easy gambling/manipulated markets. Pump a shitcoin with tons of cash people who don't do any research just see the price going up, and buy then you sell. People are not using these coins so they don't care about the tech.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:35:40
Well good luck timing the market I'll just keep putting in $20 a week instead of buying a scratcher and in 10yrs I'll either have enough for a small vacation or a yacht.
Edit: scratcher is slang for scratch off card
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:55:01
If you think Bitcoin is just "another crypto" you don't understand crypto you also probably don't understand software of tech in general. Bitcoin has the best devs working on it, the best infrastructure, and the best codebase atm. You can't just "spin" this stuff up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:19:10
Awww come on you old geezer don't be so grumpy! I'm sure you're an absolute genius! You understand Bitcoin better than everyone, better than all the geniuses who've spent thousands of hours hacking it together, and building it up. You definitely aren't set in your ways, and arrogantly dismissing new technology because you're close minded, and set in your ways...  I mean that never happens.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:48:33
I was going to type up a parody of your comment with any one of those innovations but you rambled on for way to long lol.
I MEAN
Please don't buy Bitcoin it's going to fail you're completely right there's nothing wrong with Fiat, and the current banking system, crypto is just a bubble please don't invest! All those flaws you pointed out you're so right there's no solution to them! And it'll never work out because Fiat is perfect!
You're absolutely right without regulation how can anything be successful you've opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking! Again please do not buy Bitcoin in fact you should forget about it. Even when you hear it hits a new ath you should steer clear it's never going anywhere I promise!
Do not buy.

@_date: 2017-12-21 12:33:00
Lol supporting "core" has nothing to do with economics it's about understanding open source development which you clearly have no understanding of.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:33:03
You're just regurgitating absolute nonsense. And the way you treat core like a shadowy governing body is just absolutely hilarious. BTW the devs working on Bitcoin are the best in the business, and their scaling solutions are the best being proposed.

Most people cannot write scripts unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:51:27
"it's 100% their fault" implying anyone has 100% control over btc is a fundamental misunderstanding of btc first of all. Second of all their solutions are fantastic but haven't been implented yet due to various power plays by large actors in the community. Calling them incompetent is quite frankly retarded. And if you think they're incompetent get out of crypto my friend because all the altcoins are just waiting to copy btcs solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:14:37
You're not investing more because you lost money, you're investing because you believe in Bitcoin's long term future so having a lower average cost is the optimal strategy. They are not related lol.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:22:28
Yes this is essentially how a lot of early altcoins came about they would just change a couple parameters, and slap a memey name on them
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:47:18
Except absolutely no one would agree to that business model unless it was much cheaper for the average user.

@_date: 2017-12-23 17:28:17
Then how do you not see it coming back to being usable if you have been paying so close attention, and seen the amazing things it's done why are you so skeptical it's scaling solutions will fail, and it won't be as transactable as before?
What is the reasoning behind your pessimism?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:17:17
Yes and scaling solutions have been in the works for years if you think bitcoin is near it's final form you haven't been paying attention to the tech sector for very long.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:27:22

It's possible they would have, but assault is much more mild than assault with deadly weapon, and potentially murder. I know these guys are retarded but it's a much harsher crime. 
Also this was over 7k as I said if the transaction had been 50-100$ I doubt these guys would have risked the jail time.
@_date: 2017-02-18 08:21:03
I'm confused are people actually anti-fiat? That's like being anti gas stove or anti flip phone...
@_date: 2017-02-26 11:03:14
I would say going down $200 overnight probably won't happen unless the price shoots up higher. However btc is still an emerging technology/currency so it's still prone to growth spurts, and crashes.
@_date: 2017-02-20 15:20:51
Wait aren't  all transactions with any currency irreversible without a middleman? If you gave me $20 instead of $10 for a direct service how are you going to reverse that? 
@_date: 2017-02-08 05:12:58
This is the exact opposite of a free market what are you smoking? please pass it. This is textbook collusion to shut out competition. Those pools won't just die the currency will because who will invest in a corrupt crypto?
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:21:58
Woah I diversify your savings man! I know bitcoin is awesome, but there's lots of other good ways too!
@_date: 2017-02-18 09:16:35
I think it's a myth that you want your currency to have intrinsic value that limits what services, and products can be made by adding artificial value to it.

I wouldn't bother talking to anyone who calls trump a fool. He has massive successes in multiple major industries, as well as politically.
To think that's pure luck is insanity.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:41:32
Because they're selling miners control of bitcoin. The majority of nodes, and all talented devs, and actual technical experts agree with core over BU.
@_date: 2017-02-19 10:42:50
They need to or LBC is going to fail. If these pos can get away with this, your system sucks, and people won't use it.

Then I have some water filters, a bridge, and some oils that will solve all their issues!
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:27:28
Do you have any sources backing up that it's an "ugly hack", and what's wrong with the way they co-opt users?
Personally I don't care how much "skin" you have in the game that doesn't make your solution better. I think everyone is screaming for segwit because there seems to be no logical reason behind not activating besides "Blockstream!!!"
And the fact people keep portraying this as segwit vs BU when they are not in actual opposition as far as I know.
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:21:04
Flat earth.

@_date: 2017-03-20 19:13:59
Holy fucking shit you're actually retarded. How do they get rich off of bitcoin? Oh by owning bitcoin, and making it better. 
And they don't have to be saints because it's open source which keeps them honest.
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:25:30
It is though BU is an attempt to sieze control of our money. There is no reason to treat it with civility.

Then you're way to qualified to be acting this ignorant. Even if half of transactions were darknet uses most of that is drugs. Including marijuana which many people believe should be legal. That's a far cry from "half of bitcoin is child pornography."

You seriously think a "professional" investor invests based on shit he sees on reddit.
And you're calling others naive?
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:54:09
I mean if you read the rest of the tweets he states he's against BU
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:25:44
And give all the power to the first billionaire who decides to buy them all up? Fastest way to kill btc.
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:25:25
Except $2 might be coffee for you, but that's a whole days wage in a lot of places. So we need to try to make bitcoin able to handle as many transactions as possible while retaining our other tenants.
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:53:27
Again I am pro-segwit never said otherwise. I completely disagree with your future for bitcoin however, $1, and 1bil can have the same value to someone so they should both be safe in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:02:45


@_date: 2017-03-17 18:47:26
Lmao you are so delusional. They aren't holding onto segwit as a bargaining chip. They think "core" is evil, and want to overthrow them.
I'm suprised most of them can spell segwit. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:36:18
Oh so we should listen to them because it's for their profit? Wow what a great point. A blocksize increase alone would increase centralization, and thus give those miners more control. That's without getting into the EC that BU proposes which would give them a lot more, and could be expanded in the future from what the devs have said.
If all miners cared about was blocksize segwit would of been active months ago.
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:32:51
No !some! core devs are making an emergency plan incase miners go rogue.
But you speak as if core was an entity and not a collective so I can tell you've dranken the BU kool aid.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:46:45
But the vast majority of nodes are, and the most popular wallets are segwit ready? Hmmm weird how only the miners aren't going along with it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:45:38
Both sides are not the same stop with this bullshit. Core is an open source group of volunteers who's only common interest is the prosperity of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:29:31
You said that bitcoin is expects actors to act for "profit maximizing" which is a lot like saying farms expect cows to shit a lot. So I'm not sure what your point was.
You followed this up with condension.
Then you made the point that a strict increase in blocksize does not give miners more control.
I addressed this point.
And attempted to clarify what the debate is actually about.
I put no words in your mouth.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:05:20
So you've never even owned bitcoin yet you judge the entire 18bn market cap to be based in "kiddie porn"... You are living in one delusional world.
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:16:20
4mb (which pretty much no one is suggesting) might be better purely capacity wise than those on its own, but it's also dangerous for the bottom 10% of node operators. It'd also be a hard fork which forces everyone to use it.
Also we're unsure at this point if LN, and other layer 2 solutions would be possible without segwit, but we do know this will delay these solutions by a ton.
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:25:06
I can't imagine an illustration for how far from the point you are.
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:34:59
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:04:17
Except you won't accept their fucking solution. You guys are like a bunch of snot nosed kids(bitcoin unlimited) who refuse to take your medicine (segwit), and then complain you're still sick, and now you want to go into foster care because you're being "mistreated".(ChinaBU)
This analogy makes a lot of sense.
Your analogy is hogwash.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:58:03
Except core developers are all volunteers working on an open source product. Which is inherently a meritocracy.
Roger ver is just untrustworthy.
Stop smearing bitcoin with this bullshit, stop pretending concerns over core are even remotely valid.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:13:33
You're not removing resistance you're removing backwards compatibility for a small blocksize increase. There's no reason for it.
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:36:00
This will be a non-issue it's just a matter of presentation. You won't be paying .01btc for something you'll be paying 10,000 bits or 10mbits (personally not a fan of mbits because they're less intuitive imo)
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:08:06
An etf got denied basically this etf would let people invest in bitcoin using their retirement funds which people speculated would give bitcoin a huge price spike. Price fell, and bounced very fast.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:36:21
Segwit is touted as a short term scaling solution that leads to more long term solutions.
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:58:30
That's their right they're volunteers. If they decided to only argue on reddit all day they are under no obligation to do otherwise.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:32:48
Consensus between nodes, devs, miners, and users. The system is designed so an interest group can't just take control of bitcoin. This is the fundamentally most important aspect of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:02:26
Yes indeed
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:08:25
I can't believe a comment this bad is somehow at the top. Like this is actually incredibly mindblowing. Newsflash the miners don't care about blocksize they're worried LN will steal their business!
IT WAS NEVER ABOUT THE BLOCK SIZE. THEY JUST WANT CONTROL.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:09:51
no he's anti bu read the rest of the tweets
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:33:35
I'm sorry you have reading comprehensive proportional to your non-existant technical understanding. Please keep touting how adding a HF to a SF somehow makes segwit more viable.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:52:43
He was being sarcastic lol good job man. 
edit: This post was not sarcastic.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:55:37
It's funny though
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:46:02
because 20bn is still a very small market cap
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:36:34
Except we already have this in the open source development. BU is trying to circumvent technical scrutiny by experts, and it's getting away with it because the core development team is being painted as evil because 5/~115 developers work in a bitcoin related company. And even these 5 people have contracts specifically allowing them to do what they feel is best for bitcoin.
Welcome to the insanity of the blocksize "debate" (which is not even a debate because segwit, and BU aren't mutually exclusive.)
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:38:22
And they might know nothing. That's the problem with poll's based on meaningless data.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:29:24
No we shouldn't get rid of talented devs for political reasons. It's a good thing they are employed that means they actually have talent!
If they ever submitted code that was specifically in blockstreams interest.
1. It wouldn't get commited
2. another dev would point this out.
Open source development doesn't mean "everyone's unemployed, and unbiased"
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:16:20
No we don't agree on anything. Don't say something so offensive.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:04:56
Then maybe BU should of put a hard consenus number instead of "we can activate this any time, but uhhh maybe at 75%" But of course the BU are imbeciles.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:57:58
Look I don't care about reddit politics can you tell me why they don't want segwit?
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:27:54
Lawl what an absurd statement

Etherium is pretty trash imo, and pretty sketchy with the 72mil pre mine.
Imo the only cryptos that will survive atm are monero, and bitcoin. Monero is the only other crypto that has clear differences (monero is all about privacy) as well as having actual dev support.
Most other altcoins are pretty hollow though.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:53:58
Could you actually make a point or are you going to argue exclusively in memes?

Nope eth and dash pumpers are about to learn this lesson the hard way.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:15:54
They're not masochistic they are power hungry BU offers an alternative that gives them more power. Segwit does not.
And blockstream are not funding bitcoin development. Blockstream is a completely different entity that happens to employ some developers who contribute to the bitcoin protocol.
The only way to "get rid of blockstream" Is to make some rule on who can contribute to bitcoin (currently anybody) which corrupts the open source development.
@_date: 2017-03-15 06:40:28
You're in for a world of hurt if bitcoin fails. Right now bitcoin is daddy to all the alts, and if it does it'll crash the whole market.
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:15:09
There isn't one because core isn't trying to govern bitcoin. Because core is a decentralized group of open source developers.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:47:33
Wow you clearly have no clue about bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:53:14

Misleading title this is only under draft. Hopefully it won't go through.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:10:00
So where was the positive in this? That the price of ETH is going up regardless? Because ETH is benefitting from being 1 of 2 cryptos on one of the largest exchanges.
Also that last line is pretty strange it reads a lot like a threat.
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:07:46
that's not how this works bitcoin has had no technical issue as great as what would of happened if BU was dominant. Core puts security as it's top priority. If bitcoin isn't secure the whole market will crash, and we won't see cryptos for another decade atleast.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:40:30
Blocksize is the least important thing about BU they want to fundamentally change consensus. Not to mention they're fine pushing out buggy unfinished "released" versions.
Attaching a 2mb hard fork would be the most ass backwards thing we could do.  And would not help consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:44:49
I didn't say any of that I'm against BU entirely. But that doesn't mean we should give up on letting 3rd world countries use onchain transactions.
On a final note I can't wait for LN But we're going to need solutions beyond that too.
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:07:40
Segwit makes lightning possible much sooner.

Because safely, and securely implementing Dynamic blocksize would take 2-3 years the very least. Segwit is ready today.

Okay so let me make an analogy that you can understand. It's okay to write to honda "Your cars are not fast enough" It is not useful to write "Your cars are not fast enough, add another cylinder"
It is also not a smart idea then to go support, some yahoo who's promising a 7-cylinder car, and then going around, and tricking 51% of the factories into making this car.
I think most core devs understand usability is an inherent property of really any currency. You can't make an "architectural masterpiece" while ignoring a core aspect.

I didn't imply he was dumb incredibly smart people can have dumb opinions. As you said he's been trashing Fiat which is correct, but he trashed it for the wrong reason. I mean the option you didn't mention is just having your money in Fiat which unfortunately a lot of people do.
I mean I love crypto probably more than the next guy, but gold still seems like a safe long term bet.

We spend a fortune on education. The problem is the government is incompetent, and should not be trusted with the minds of the future.

You shouldn't make broad claims of others being delusional when you're basically just whining. Of course bitcoin is volatile it's emerging tech in an emerging industry. The meme about a 10mil pizza proves no point it's more of a fun fact. If he could of bought the pizza with usd instead he could of bought more btc with the USD.
Stop being so salty.

What? It's a basic investing strategy to buy when something you believe has higher value is going lower... If you buy in during a bull run your profit potential is lower, and the chance you get out before a crash is lower too I believe.
Not a pro or anything though.

Yes I have actually. But bitcoin core doesn't produce a product that user's understand. It's product also doesn't need it's users to understand, they just need it to work, and be reliable.
But core needs technical expertise not user feedback.

Well it's better to say Bitcoin has the most devs working on it, and if we look at output, and breakthroughs Bitcoin still leads the pack so at least in  crypto it's a very safe bet that Bitcoin has the best devs.

The best way to help the lowest people in society is through freedom. Giving them the opportunity to make something of themselves. Higher education is not a magic cure all especially if you're not going for something that will give you skills with real demand. And I don't care if it's prossive if it's progressing to a bad place.

You may not be for open borders but your politicians certainly are. Your state is famous for it's "sanctuary cities". You like to rant about, and insult things that no one is talking about. I mean what even is the second part of your comment? I never said a word about police? How does this relate to anything. If anything the reason police would need unions is because there's not a free market of police stations(and couldn't be). But again no idea how this relates.

Stocks aren't Fiat though eventually there will be a service to buy stocks with crypto. There's also a lot of different ways to put money in the market, so even if the market does well it doesn't necessarily mean you did well.
Gold has infinitely more practical uses today than ever with it's prevalence in technology. Plus human vanity hasn't gone anywhere.

"anti-science folks" lol! Yep you're very rich see how long that lasts when you have an open border, with more welfare, and Medicare. It's a lot easier to squander a fortune than to make one.

Price success in crypto is primarily linked to exchange availability. The biggest being coinbase because of the ease of use, and the reoccurring buy feature.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:50:01
California is an amazing place with multiple huge successes in culture, and industry. As well as being rich in natural resources, and beauty. It should be number  in just about everything. But when you call your cities "sanctuaries" for foreign people, and leave your borders open, and give free stuff to the people. You're cooking up a recipe that no economy can handle.

I'm not twisting anything you said. A lot of people are "stupid" enough to leave money uninvested. Very few people understand the effect inflation has on their money, or anything about investing. I'm not debating gold vs stocks I don't think it's a zero sum game between them where one has to win.
In SHTF scenario maybe initially people don't care about gold because they need water, food, lead, but when things stabilize rare commodities, are going to be more valuable than ever.
Again there's no "winning" here I invest in crypto, stocks, and I'm planning on putting a % in precious metals too.

We'll see if your short term model holds true. Another decade of democratic rule will be enough to reduce the Golden State to dust eitherway.
