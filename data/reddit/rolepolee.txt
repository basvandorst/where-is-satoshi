By no signature do you mean that

From my limited experience, Japan is a cash society. It's common to carry around the equivalent of ~200-300 USD in your wallet at a time. This could be because of the relatively low crime rates, because credit cards are much more difficult to get (maybe just for foreigners), or it's because that's just the way things are. 
It's not rare or odd to drop the equivalent of a 100USD bill to buy a soda at the convenience store. But in the past 18 months living here I've only seen a credit/debit card used for grocery shopping twice. Hell, I don't even have a debit card with my checking account and have never seen a check. 
So why does Japan stray away from credit cards? Many of the uses of credit cards in the United States still have cash options in Japan. When shopping online, many stores offer the option of paying cash on delivery, or paying in advance at a terminal at the convenience store. Utility bills, tickets to events, and even expensive airfares can also be paid this way through partnerships with convenience stores. There's so much potential for bitcoin integration with the systems they have, probably more so than other credit dependent nations, but I don't see the generally risk-adverse Japanese people dropping their cash for BTC.
Let me know if I was unclear or if you have more questions.

You obviously don't watch basketball closely enough if you consider the GSW as struggling.

Honestly, if Bitcoin ever breaks into the Japanese convenience store market it would be huge. But unfortunately I also think Japan will be one of the slower developed nations to adopt Bitcoin on a wide scale.

Thanks for this. I see they take a 5% fee after the project is completely funded and then the funds are disbursed. But couldn't people just post their address/QR code and then people can just check to see how much BTC is in it? Is there something where people/organizations could just post their address and get funds without the in-between?

Ah thanks for pointing that out to me!

It's fine if you're fine with bitcoin being your only investment, meaning you're fine if you happen to lose all your bitcoins or bitcoin's value goes to zero. Not saying that either will happen, but it's smart to diversify your investments.

Because I live abroad and I'm tired of exchange rates, remittance fees, transfer limits, and having to do so much work to a couple numbers over the web. I'm really pushing for the technology and infrastructure to develop even more so I can just change my paycheck to BTC instantly and send it wherever I like.

Wasn't there some wealth distribution analysis that shows Bitcoin's wealth is already less concentrated than the USD.
