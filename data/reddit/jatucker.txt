Lots of evil in the world but government plus banking tops the list.

On the issue of Andreas's supposed implied attack on the Catholic Church, those scientific battles of the late middle ages really amounted to the Church deferring (too much) to the prevailing scientific consensus. The same goes on today in universities and governments, obviously. Andreas's comments didn't upset me in the slightest.

This event was wonderful for me. I was extremely impressed at Beck's thoughtfulness and humility. He seems extremely interested in nonpolitical ways to change the world, and it is apparent that he is developing a love affair with technology. THis is the source of his interest in Bitcoin. Off topic but here is something that really impressed me about him. He is not an intimidating person at all. this is HIGHLY unusual for a person in his person. This is very much to his credit. Just a normal guy with a teachable spirit. That's my strong sense.

When he needed to go, I showed him the men's room.

Can't wait for this!!! See you soon!

romance! This comment is great. Sometimes I see such cynicism around here. My book is more romantic, which is why I sort of dread the idea of redditors reading it. So, thank you for this comment. I like the dream most of all. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:54:06
Probably :)

HEre is a summary of the major themes. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:53:34
First, thanks for this post. Also, I seriously doubt that there is anything new in here re: BTC for anyone on this forum. I do have lots of money theory in here. But the main point of the book is to treat BTC as part of a larger disintermediating trend. Of course I'm happy for anyone to buy it and I don't want to discourage that. Maybe it is good for people you know who do not hang out here. A physical copy is indeed coming, about 130 pages. I'm excited just to have something in hand that discusses these emerging trends and what they mean for politics and social order.

As the publisher of the piece and a friend of the author, I can assure you that she meant this affectionately. She loves loves loves the radicalism of the BTC community. She asked me to change this word and edit the piece for clarity on this point.

It turns that I was wrong on the amount in the movie. I couldn't remember but I was later corrected that it was $50 million. I corrected this on the original version. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:05:25
exactly what we are seeing with crypto
@_date: 2015-07-07 02:14:44
thank you! 
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:09:03
Thank you all for the support. The Embassy is truly hoping for support from the entire crypto community, no exceptions. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:21:16
I'm really curious why you say this. I wrote an article about an important speech and tried to find its most salient part and make it the headline. What is wrong with what I did here, in your view?
@_date: 2015-11-30 03:31:47
wow, this is so wonderful and beautiful. Please spread far and wide because...to get this fully requires an odd combination of both Blockchain knowledge and appreciation of Taylor Swift. Odd combination. Yay Naomi! 
@_date: 2015-11-22 16:55:54
thank you so much for saying this!

It's an amazing piece 
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:35:41
It's a good and patient response, pointless for the target, but good for general education and, yes, modeling how to engage people without being a jerk. 
@_date: 2013-08-20 00:32:15
really outstanding. Lucid, systematic, interesting to read.
@_date: 2013-08-09 20:18:09
thanks. It's always difficult to comment accurately about the situation in other countries. Look how many people in the world believe that the US is the land of the free. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 20:20:39
Would love to and I've pushed for it for a year. LFB is owned by Agora Fin, which in turn is owned by Agora Inc. which has offices in like 50 countries and all parts of this gigantic machinery have a centralized accounting and authentication system and I can honestly say I've never met anyone in those offices. i know from my intermediary that they are working on it but I can also imagine that the complications must be enormous. It is so so much easier for start ups to do this stuff.

This is a very interesting letter. I've learned a few things. I just love how many points of view there are on what makes Bitcoin wonderful. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:36:57
yes yes yes yes!!!!
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:22:57
This exact thing happened to me with 10BTC

Oh, also, I hope that this appearance can get some attention for this conference we are doing in Atlanta with Bitpay and others. It's October 5. if anyone can help get the word out, that would be great. I'm hoping that this event will help mainstream the thing further.

I was very happy that Matt agreed to do the interview at all. Lots of times, interviewers are nervous about topics like this because there is a lot of technical jargon thrown around -- and in this case, you end up juggling three really tricky areas: monetary theory, cryptography, and open source networking. That's a pretty scary brew for people who haven't experienced the money before. In all the talks I've had with people, it is pretty clear who is in and who isn't, and those who are not in are often anxious to move on for fear of getting into a thicket of explanation and discussion they can't really follow or participate in.

I loved his stuff on mining at 26:00. So interesting. And of course yes I would love to talk to any of these wonderful people. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 12:47:12
Thank you all for these wonderful comments! You can't believe how great it makes me feel. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 19:22:55
I'm happy to be corrected. I was impressed at Argentinian apartment renting and home buying sites quoting almost everything in Bitcoin. that's the basis of my comments. 
@_date: 2013-07-19 18:59:35
Totally understand! It's a large company and I can't make accounting and legal do what I want. However, there are people working with them to make it happen. The complications of BTC for large international subscription base legacy companies are...notable. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:14:11
IndieGoGo is not BTC friendly but we tried our best. About 5% from BTC so far. 
@_date: 2013-09-11 03:28:02
Yes, I'm sorry I annoy you. I can only say that I try to be sincere and do my best and share my love of BTC. Thank goodness I'm not the sole spokesman!

I was just so thrilled that Stossel asked the question. This was a huge crowd, dominated by gold bugs, and hardly anyone there had even heard of this digital currency. After the event, LFB ended up selling lots of the Cox book on BTC. In some ways, it was a kind of coming out of Bitcoin among the non-geek libertarian-conservative crowd.
