If it becomes unprofitable, players will leave the market until it becomes profitable again

It should move to the same 8MB that BCH chose, it just won't because that isn't profitable for the people trying to develop off-chain transaction mechanisms

You seem to be missing the point. More people doing it means less profit for the people that were already doing it. Even if they're still making some profit, they're making less than they would have otherwise.
The question was why people don't talk about arbitrage, and the answer is because it means they'll make less money. If you think you're actually making a point, it's because you don't understand that concept.

Exactly. Sometimes I watch transactions on Bitfinex, and you'll see swings of 3-5% in minutes sometimes, and it's not like you can keep holding on if that happens, because it could be the start of a major correction. When bitcoin hit 17.5k and then dropped all the way down to 13k last week comes to mind. Yeah, it mostly came back up, but you can't know it's going to do that.

I saw some trades in the $4030 range
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:57:09
Yeah, I was watching some live trading and there were a few trades that went up to $4030. Cooled off a bit and we're at $3950 right now

Monero might be good as an actual functional wallet since it masks your holdings and dealings.

With typical investments, $10k gives you roughly $400/year in earnings, a whole dollar per day. That is not retirement money in any country, unless you plan on living in a mud hut and having your diet consist of rice cooked in unsanitary water over a wood fire.

This is stupid on so many levels, I honestly wonder if the owner is just trolling people.
Do you leave it in your car and not have your mining equipment running most of the time, or are you lugging your computer in and out of your car every time you're going somewhere, or do you have a multi-kilowatt space heater constantly running in your car while it's in the garage?

What happens when someone if someone figures out how to flip a bit so one of itself is worth zero of itself.
You probably don't get that joke because you need a very high IQ to understand it /s

You're grossly misinformed about what silk road sold. Guns were forbidden. Assassination services were forbidden. Child pornography was forbidden. Anything that could be used 'to harm or defraud others' was forbidden.
And trying to use 'tax evader' as an insult/smear tactic is just silly. The guy ran a website for a variety of illegal goods and made millions. You think if he reported and paid taxes on that shit he wasn't going to get investigated? I mean, he was investigated anyways, but he didn't know that.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:11:24
You could get fake identities, stolen ones wouldn't have been allowed because that falls under the 'defrauds or harms others' category of forbidden items.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:01:00
Silk Road forbade you from selling child pornography, guns, or 'things used to harm or defraud others'. There were and probably are other sites that sold such things, but his point about the sentence being justified because of CP is invalid
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:59:03
Child pornography, assassinations, and anything that involved harming or defauding others was forbidden. Yes, Silk Road sold lots of drugs, but that's nowhere on the same level as what other people seem to believe in this thread.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:24:42
Attempted assassinations were alleged, never proven, so irrelevant to his sentencing. As I've said a couple of times to other people in the thread bringing up the assassination thing again, if he did do it, and that was provable in a court of law beyond a reasonable doubt, a life sentence would probably be reasonable. But it wasn't, and he was sentenced to life in prison for running a website that sold (mostly) drugs.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:43:38
You seem to be coming from a perspective that "the law is the law". The issue isn't what the law is, it's about what's just. If he did attempt to hire hitmen to have people murdered, and there is enough evidence that a prosecutor can prove that beyond a reasonable doubt, then prison for life makes sense. 
The main issue is he wasn't sent to prison for life for supposedly hiring hitmen and wasn't convicted of doing so. He was sent to prison for life for running a market where you could buy and sell almost anything, except child pornography, guns, and a few other things I'm forgetting. Of course the majority of transactions was drugs, and yes it was illegal, and yes the guy deserved to go to prison. But not for life. Those types of sentences should be reserved for murderers, child rapists, maybe a few other categories of criminals depending on circumstances. Not a dude running a tor website where you could buy drugs for bitcoins
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:22:05
I've noticed a lot of people in this thread with suspiciously new reddit accounts making the same BS claims:
- That Silk Road sold child pornography, guns, and assassinations, which it didn't.
- That he hired hitmen to murder multiple people (while possibly true, was never convicted in court, so irrelevant to his sentencing)
And other crap. Yes, for running and making millions off a website that sold hard drugs, including stuff like heroin, fentanyl, meth, etc, the guy deserved to go to prison. But for what he was convicted of, life was not an appropriate punishment. I really hope we see some appeal and reduction in sentence.

Did you lose them? Or were you one of the few people that sold them for less?
