Bitcoin is working fine without institutional acceptence. Remember what Andreas says about these guys. We don't need their permission to do what we are doing, and we don't need their validation now to grow.

This - transfer to GDAX (use your same login credentials from Coinbase - same company). Then get yo shit off the exchange and into a wallet. You don't really own your bitcoin until you control your private keys.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:20:44
"A Bitcoin private key is simply an integer between one and about 1077. This may not seem like much of a selection, but for practical purposes it’s essentially infinite.
If you could process one trillion private keys per second, it would take more than one million times the age of the universe to count them all. Even worse, just enumerating these keys would consume more than the total energy output of the sun for 32 years. This vast keyspace plays a fundamental role in securing the Bitcoin network."

I understand that I don't owe taxes on mutual funds until I sell. But does the IRS get notified when I invest a certain amount in mutual funds? i.e. my 401k invests in mutual funds but that shouldn't flag me for an audit. It seems that crypto is being unfairly scrutinized.

Shouldn't the damages be in Bitcoin, not fiat? If I had 1BTC at the time of the "hacking", I should receive 1BTC back in recovered assets. Any assets Karpeles had (including Bitcoin) should be liquidated - or redistributed - to make Mt. Gox customers whole.

Yes. I had this problem too. I had to contact support (very responsive) and they reset my account so I could add USD to the Cash Card. Then I could buy BTC. 
Ultimately though, this app isn't for me since I can't offload the Bitcoin into cold storage, only sell it.

My buddy is really into it and he started sharing his portfolio numbers with me about a year ago. At the time BTC was at ~$2100 I think. I thought he was having an anti-government, doomsday conspiracy episode and I had a blast making fun of him. 
We were touring Europe earlier this year and he was still sharing his numbers with me, up around $1000. We travelled through Switzerland on their train pass - which excepted Bitcoin. I stopped making fun of him and started listening and asking hard questions.
About a two weeks after that trip I checked BTC on a whim and it had jumped another *$1000*! I called him immediately and begged him to get me on the rollercoaster. Thankfully, he showed me the ropes and I've been hooked - and grateful - to him ever since. It's cliche, but I wish I would have jumped the first time he told me about it!

I think that it's a VERY exciting time for blockchain and bitcoin but, as someone who experienced - and suffered consequences of - the dotcom thud (c. 2001) firsthand, I see a lot of similarities. 
I think BTC is valued too high and we'll see a normalizing after a dramatic - and very long - dip. I also think that taxation will be unfairly weighted towards crypto. New laws (in the U.S.) will not categorize BTC as capital gains, but something else and it will sting the investor at sale time. Lastly, I don't think Satoshi's vision of a peer-to-peer currency will play out quite like he envisioned. It seems it's a vault asset not being used as liquid currency. Why buy day-to-day items with BTC when hodling appears to pay dividends? It would be like buying coffee with a tiny fragment of gold.
The good news is I think most the alt-coins will wither and die. 
Anyway, that's my opinions. Would love to hear constructive feedback where I may be wrong or misinformed.
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:59:19
New technologies have growing pains. When personal checks were young, scams called "paper hanging" demanded that a new FBI unit be dedicated to addressing them - see *Catch Me If You Can.*
When web hosting was in it's infancy server crooks used to charge thousands of dollars for (even slight) data overages. It seems comical now, but it was prevalent.
What happened? It got fixed. How? The market drove the fix organically. If Bitcoin is the next big thing, security measures will be in place that prevents all this stumbling and fog of insecurity. Be extremely careful now. It's your assets, you only have yourself to blame if you don't educate yourself to secure your loot.

Am I taking crazy pills or is he suggesting a "better" cryptocurrency that is coming from a **centralized** server? This third party holds the all the cash from purchases in trust and, gee whiz, promises not to manipulate the books and will even buy your coins at original cost in case - *gasp* - the numbers tank. Moreover, the centralized body holding this fiat wealth does this all at no cost, takes no slice of the pie, does not pre-mine the bittolkens? They just... do this because it's the altruistic thing to do.

I don't understand why we celebrate the establishment giving bitcoin legitimacy. We know it's value.

Count on it.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:29:56
The blockchain technology that Bitcoin utilizes cannot be "shut down". This is a benefit of being decentralized. I don't know where you live but in the U.S. it can be taxed as capital gains when purchased through an reputable exchange; just like the stock market.
As a newbie you can buy real, and authentic Bitcoin directly from Coinbase. 
You should transfer your Bitcoin to an offline wallet - like Ledger Nano - or paper wallet. This is called cold storage where no one can get their hands on your Bitcoin as long as you take precaution to keep them secure.
There is plenty of information on this subreddit about all of these points if you need more details.

@_date: 2017-10-20 02:36:00
You can buy on Coinbase, you can even leave an amount you're comfortable with on Coinbase for a while. No biggie. The downside is you don't have your private keys when stored on an exchange. You need to own your private keys and then you truly have control over your Bitcoin. 
The reason you're hearing negative rhetoric about Coinbase is because there is going to be a fork in November and no one (really) knows what's going to happen. So better to lean on the side of caution and get them off before the fork.
I have Ledger Nano S and paper wallets and they are great for newbies. Lots of info and how-tos already out there, go get it.
