Instead of throwing them in the closet, why not send them off to someone where the electricity is very cheap?

That's actually not very "safe". Imagine this exchange takes place in the US. From the recipient they'll be able to find out the time and location this took place.
Satoshi is a human being bound by time and space, meaning he'd have to get to that time and spot physically. So authorities would be able to find out everybody that is within a certain radius at various times. The people who have the capability of doing something like Bitcoin is maybe 0.1% of the general population. So given a list of 30 million people that were in that city that day (say he does it in NYC) that leaves you with 300,000 people to consider. 
Now you take that 300,000 people and eliminate everybody that you know was not at the location at the time. That's probably another 99.9%. Now you're down to 300 people.
That's a sufficiently small number of people that you can literally go door to door.
So obviously you're not going to be able to make the exchange in a sufficiently developed nation. Ok try meeting up in a nation that doesn't have a lot of surveillance resources. That's not going to work either because those nations don't receive a lot of travel, so it's easy for someone like the US Gov to know who traveled to said country and you'll be starting with a substantially smaller set.
It's actually pretty interesting... if Satoshi never wants to be found out, he/she won't be able to spend his/her coins for a long time, if ever.

Once you have a majority, then what?
Unless you're looking to take down Bitcoin for some political reason, what would be the incentive to screw up the network?

Why do you say that the network will not be quick enough to respond to the change in hashing power from miners leaving? Let's say the hashing power went to 1/100 of what it is now tomorrow at 8AM. How long would it take for the difficulty to adjust?

As the network matures and miner economic incentive moves from getting newly released bitcoins to transaction fees, wouldn't they be incentivized to release larger blocks with more transaction? Of course there's a tradeoff with larger blocks-&gt;lower probability, but the increase of transaction fees will act as a positive force for increasing block size so the increase will happen over time.

Appreciate the response. I responded to that specific point post.
On a more general point I do think that the Bitcoin community in general and the protocol in particular have been open to improvement. I think it's in pretty much everybody's best interest to make sure Bitcoin doesn't undergo catastrophic failure, so if we started getting into real problems, I do think there's enough smart people involved to worth through them - and everybody else is motivated to go along with it.
What other big problems do you see?
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:28:26
There's an alternative that I mentioned that you didn't consider - include more transactions in each block.
As the mining reward lowers the incentive for just getting a block out there diminishes. Instead the transactions in the block matters more and more. In particular, the number of transactions. So yes, right now there's a disincentive for miners to use small block sizes, that is going to be overwhelmed by the incentive to include more transactions to get more transaction fee money.

When you say they're sceptical is this because of actual research they've done into the system and shown systematically how it will break down? If so, would love to see that research.
If such research doesn't exist, then this is just an argument of authority which is pretty lame.
