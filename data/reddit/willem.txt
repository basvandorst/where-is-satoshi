Agreed. This is not the bitcoin I remember. It's different, unwieldy. Feels cumbersome. It feels like Segwit exacerbated the learning curve. I know it's good for the long run, but the seams are bursting now. This feels almost like that 1st "crash" ($30 to $2), only with a weird mix of rally-euphoria. 
It could be worse though; it could be undersubscribed... It's a great time to be building.

Your observation and debunk is exactly right. My comparison is completely wrong. I understand the technical details behind the node differences in this context. 
The point I was trying to make is that we, as engineers, are able to pull arbitrary datapoints from the air to prove points we're trying to make. To the layman (politician/lawyer/joe-soap etc.) it would seem like a valid argument (nodes are nodes right?). But they're really not. It is the very definition of conjecture.
We used to do this thing in debate class where, if you were unable to hold up a valid argument for both sides of a differing opinion during practice, you were disallowed from debating any side of it in competition. From the division of opinions I've seen in this whole debate I conclude that not many people had the same experience growing up.

Without context the 5863 node total means nothing. I provided an example which puts that number of nodes (and its capability) into context.

Nice! Almost 6000 permanent nodes up today. Ignore pre-2014 stats, full-node metrics sucked very hard pre-2013. e.g. It used to count temporary-up nodes as well.

Some ISPs quite literally inject whatever they want over http, which means that the information served over a non-secure link could show incorrect information, or something completely different than what you intend to.
Comcast, for example, has many millions of US subscribers and does this:

This is a valid reason for not moving to guild:
Same thing @ Eligius:
If you don't mine @ Ghash.io, your payout will be x% less (where x is a positive number) because other pools may be blockwithheld against @ scale. 
There are 3 benefits to a large pool which also owns a large amount of hashing power to blockwithhold against competing pools:
1. Your hashrate does not contribute to difficulty increases (you're not submitting blocks).
2. You still get paid for your share submissions (albeit a little less).
3. You're essentially attacking users of the pool you're withholding against. Their payouts are lower, so they're driven elsewhere.
And just in case anyone is wondering: Yes, of course it's technically possible (easy) to blockwithhold against p2pool. Bitcoin (pooled) mining is very very broken at the moment.

I'll give it a go (correct me if I'm wrong).
**Current Bitcoin difficulty**= 40,300,030,328 (
**Total network shares/s:** difficulty/600 (difficulty adjust to find on average a share &gt; difficulty every 600s/10mins)
40,300,030,328/600 = 67166717
**Hashrate**: Shares/s*( 2^32 )
**Getwork**: Older method used by bitcoind for work distribution. Getblocktemplate is the "upgrade" to getwork. I'm surprised getwork is still in use as it's extremely network-heavy (probably explains the high 6% PPS rate).
**Accepted:** If you're mining @ diff1 then any share which is &gt;diff1 is submitted by the mining instance (bfg/cgminer), then either accepted or rejected (see below for reject reasons). Pools generally adjust difficulty pool-side in order for your mining instance to submit an average amount of shares per minute: aka vardiff. If you submit a share with diff=500 and your difficulty is set to 1, your diffaccepted (DiffA) is still only 1 and you still only get paid for diff=1.
**Rejected:** Sum total of the following: stale (received by pool after a block change), duplicate (a share you've already submitted is submitted again), invalid (computed incorrectly) shares.
**Discarded:** When the pool realises that a new block has been found, it sends new work to miners. If the miner gets a notification from the pool to work on new work, it discards the current work (completing unwanted work it is a waste of compute time).
My suggestion would be to run your own (local) pool and set the minimum accepted difficulty to 1. I can help with this if you want. You'll need a linux computer with bitcoind running (and synced), and a couple of minutes to install ckpool (barebones, no db). 10GH/s would mainly generate dust, and most pools don't service dust payouts (costs more to send than the amount sent), they rather wait until a minimum threshold is met.

A note: In the example all the pools mining under the 1MB block size are mining at their set maximum. bitcoind uses 750kB block size as default. See:  (see "max block size" column).
The shown dataset is tiny and anecdotal, but raises a valid point nonetheless. In the example it's safe to assume that no transactional backlog was cleared for at least the full 2 hours. This is the worst kind of bad. I'm a proponent of simply removing the block size limit completely.

I've been keeping a 'technical' eye on both the btc1 and bitcoin-abc repositories.
As I'm a software developer, I tend towards wanting to see software projects succeed. I initially thought, maybe it's a case of a serene duck pedaling hard underneath the surface ( Had a bit of hope when I saw the pull requests had a bit more action than the commits: 
But no, nothing much there either.
My conclusion is that Bitcoin-ABC and BTC1 both have one or more of following properties:
1. Flawless codebases requiring no further developer input.
2. No developer interest.
3. Rules that disallow commits to the the current public codebase.
All permutations of the above resulted in me losing interest in "keeping an eye" on either of these repositories.

Your idea has been niggling me for a few years, I've had the same. The capital outlay for initial development ($10-12M?) shouldn't be an issue, but there's a bridge that requires crossing:
If we can't make the masks free-and-open-source after the initial tape-out (a Fabricator bespoke limitation) it's a problem (no open-source community support). How do we address that? Does the possibility exist for a Fab to say "ok, it's not rocket science - we can release our bespoke sha256 14/16nm library into the wild, for a price"? Or am I barking up (misunderstanding) the incorrect, hardware source tree? To mitigate, is it possible to open source the chip supply-chain? How?
The alternative is starting up an open-source Fab, if we can't figure out how to bridge this gap. That capital outlay (hundreds of M?) is prohibitive at the moment though.

Ah, I digg - you have a specific use-case in mind because you're stating a relative term like "quickly". The video covers unidirectional and bidirectional channels, but it's probably better if you elaborate on exactly which use-case you're thinking about (e.g. daily coffee, gambling, weekly groceries), so I can research and tailor the explanation a bit better. I'm (a developer) in the process of wrapping my head around it at the moment as well, so looking fwd to poking it with a sharp stick in the next few weeks.
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:43:26
I didn't get any "top-up" vibe/option from the video so unless I'm mistaken it wasn't covered. Definitely worth digging into though as I get your concern: e.g. I subscribe to a magazine and pay them monthly off-chain (uni-directional). When that money runs out, I gotta close and re-open another channel (on-chain) to continue getting the sweet sweet mags every month.
Did a bit of googlin' and that turned up these two links:
So I'm asking myself - If we already have H and R (from the vid) and we trust enough to settle off-chain - is there an extension that can be added to that established trust to amend/update the original contract (trust-required), or do we just re-open and recommit on-chain when the subscription expires after, say 1 year (trust-less)? 
Hardcore blockchain theory is hardcore. It certainly isn't practice yet, but definitely worth a deep-technical-dive. Cheers for the food-for-thought!

Then Bixin steps in with an 18.34 BTC block. 
Nice 46.74% fees is nice. I thought these fee-lvls would be the norm at the next halvening. This is an outlier, but in the same ballpark. Interesting...
It's inconsequential to hate on miners who mine empty blocks. It's allowed, and it cannot be disallowed. At this point in time, it's a very real loss for them (and their clients) so they probably didn't do it intentionally.

Not a big fan of when people say bitcoin is deflationary. Supply inflation tending to zero over time does not equal deflation. Does it not make it neither?

I understand what you're saying, but I think you're trying to address the concept of why indie gaming exists (or shouldn't exist?) and this probably isn't the forum for that.
That said, I think you might find different gaming experiences in just that bundle (not just indie gaming as a whole). Some exceprts from reviews I've read:
* Play Offline and choose either a relaxing, zen-like experience, or a challenging and exciting struggle.
* An awkwardly named 'interactive narrative that explores concepts of human rationality and recursive self-improvement', it is both compelling and tedious, an odd experience that I can neither condemn nor recommend.
My take on indie gaming is finding those different experiences and widening my taste for gaming. When you get to our age (thirtysomethings) we evolve the clarity and patience to spend a little bit of time in evolving into gaming connoisseurs, instead of just "gamers". Think of these games as a selection of fine wines. The experience would be worth it in the end.
For me, this bundle represents not just that, but as a long-time redditor I've come to appreciate its recommendations. As a bitcoiner I applaud this initiative and will support it (by buying and playing them) simply because I firmly believe that this value-transfer system is far superior to any other such thing that our civilization has thus far produced.

True. If you ask four players each to pay say $1 to enter a deathmatch (e.g. FPS)...
If you subtract an amount (to the killer) for every time a player dies and the last man standing (or a timer is hit) wins the pot ($4) it could work. This is not pay to play, you're right. If you allow players to pay extra for bigger/better guns (in this context) that's pay to play.

I'm a layman so I'll try answering as layman-y as possible.
The concept of **"proof of work"** stops them. In order to mint new coins you need to come up with the answer to a difficult mathematical question. If you do, you can call those new coins yours. Anyone can verify the answer easily, so they **accept** (acceptance is key for being able to spend them) the newly minted coins as valid, but it's impossible to get to the answer without "doing work". That work is being done with computational power. The current computational power of the bitcoin network is roughly 2-3 times that of the top 500 supercomputers on planet earth, combined. They'd need to match that (and a little more) to "mint" their own coins (and be able to spend them).
I think. If my answer sucks, I'm sure an expert will point it out - those guys are awesome :)
There's a whole bunch of other mathematical and computational mumbo-jumbo that goes along with it, it's all really quite clever, and worth a read. I'll try to shorten/improve/correct the previous paragraph a bit later on.

Think of it like this: every bitcoin address is a representation of a specific private key. Let's say your private key is **RockyLeal123**. Every bitcoin address your client generates represents **RockyLeal123**, which is why you can spend bitcoins sent to those addresses.
What the vanity address generator does is simply look through (randomly I think, but [Piachu]( will be able to give you more specifics as it's his brainchild) millions of valid addresses per second (an algorithm determines validity) for ANY private key. When it finds an address which is valid and matches the characters you give it, it gives you a **new** private key (say: **PoopyPants321**) which is represented by the vanity address. You then have to import that **new** private key into **your** client (in order to spend coins sent to that receiving address).
**The vanity address mining process never touches the bitcoin network. You don't even need the client installed to generate it. No other addresses/keys are ever used/discarded, other than the one which the "mining" process spits out.**
The process is a lot more involved, math/cryptopgraphy mumbo-jumbo and all that and I'm sure there's open documentation on it somewhere, but I think that's how it works.

Only those supported by  as I really cannot be bothered making manual fiat transfers. It probably results me in losing out in many opportunities, but automation is key for me. For example, they recently removed cryptoxchange from the mix, so I did the same. If the exchange does not support coupon or bitcoin withdrawals via API (a prerequisite for automated bitinstant API use), then I don't bother.
Sorry to sound like such a fanboi, but in my opinion Bitinstant is currently a big part of the glue which keeps bitcoin stable (i.e. lesser price volatility than in 2011). As much as I love everyone there, I think it a competitor for bitinstant would stabilize bitcoin further. In my opinion, healthy competition in any tech/financial space is good.

I think the issue with the decimals is that, sure, dollars can be divided to n decimals, but they’re practically (the operative word) worthless beyond the 2nd one, and become more so with inflation. With deflation, the decimals become meaningful because they hold measurable (and useful) value. They become more meaningful wih time, as deflation progresses.
The argument that gold can also be divisble to whatever arbitrary divisible amount really can't hold. Simply because it isn't practical. If I could send you a mote of gold dust from across the globe without fear of losing it, maybe. But I can't.
Practicality is key in currency. Its practical use is to store value.

I think "worthless" is simply the dictionary meaning: Having no real value or use. Bitcoin being worthless would mean that it would have no use and thus demand for it would drop to nil. There are already many existing (and profitably strong) use cases for bitcoin.

Arbitrage trading is awesome as it's a win-win-win-win-win situation. It turns the impatience (intended or otherwise) of a person/bot buying higher than the going rate (or selling lower than the going rate) into profit for the arbitrage trader, the two exchanges as well as the company providing fiat transfers between the exchanges. It's a great stabilizer for the bitcoin price as a whole.
Speaking from the experience of someone who built a bot from scratch (to both learn a new programming language and "do something" bitcoin-y), I can say the experience has been worthwhile. As long as you don't expect to become rich overnight, you're good. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have with this, technical or otherwise.

Don't let modern journalism fool you. The article makes no mention that the authorities have any clue as to whether they're getting "many" or "few". 
The only real data we're able to glean from the article is that (at least) ~0.5% (30/100x60) of all packages delivered in Esperance contain illegal drugs. 
Also, it only mentions that they screen packages - probably most of the drugs are simply being delivered in normal envelopes. The guy who was removed from the equation because their vendor used a parcel to send 1g of cocaine is probably so pissed...

* Yes, I consider my development-time as a zero-cost (hobby) so my expenses are nil. The bot only ever trades when profit is guaranteed.
* Any small amount of capital will do, but you get better rates with higher numbers obviously. For example, the cost of transferring &lt;$100 @ bitinstant is 1.29%, and 0.89% for &gt;$100. Considering this, and trading at a minimum of 2 exchanges, you'll need at least: $150 fiat x 2, $150 worth of btc x2 - so $600 to start would be good, but you can (and should) test your code with tiny amounts - generally the minimum trade allowed is 0.01 BTC. Balance is important. remember with arbitrage you'll be trading the same money over and over again. I've consistently  been able to leverage my capital about 1:12 (that is my investment is $x, my trade volume is $x times 12). This is important, as a lower investment making the same amount as a higher investment is more successful. I'd say making a profit with [very little]( is much more satisfying than making a lot.
* Not everyone can code, I guess. Most people think the arbitrage market is saturated. It isn't.
* I use python on Google App Engine, though I'd like to move over to Java on GAE as the available development tools are better (Eclipse and inline debugging/step-through).
* Much less time-critical than you think. It's not unusual for arbitrage opportunities to remain for several minutes. You don't need high-frequency trading experience to benefit from it. Not saying this won't change in the future, but it hasn't since I started trading in Feb 2012. I can share some actual data with you if you want.

In the author's defense he did use the phrase "monetary gold" and it would seem that he is quite specific on the fact that commodities are the ones holding the actual value.
[By definition]( **A raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold, such as copper or coffee. A useful or valuable thing, such as water or time** bitcoin is not a commodity. Bitcoins are a pure representation of assigned-value (supply/demand), which is why it's so perfect as money. 
Sure, we trade it like a commodity, but we can't eat it or make anything with it, other than use it as value exchange. It's much better than gold/fiat in this sense as it is weightless + indestructible + infinitely divisible + un-counterfeitable. Yay technology/cryptography :) There's that and, as an open protocol, we as software devs can build cool shit on top of it.

1. I didn't say gold is bad, on the contrary I said it's good because it's so crazy useful. The fact that it's used as a store of value (currency) is bad. Who decides (sets) the base value of your proposed currency? If you say "the market" then I totally agree with you.
2. Totally agree. ["Since the agreements of 1971 and 1973, OPEC oil is exclusively quoted in US dollars. This created a permanent demand for dollars on the international exchange markets."]( Should be interesting to see what will happen to the USD value **when** the oil runs out.
3. I try my utmost to not plan for every possible eventuality. I also don't plan for "what if the sun doesn't come up tomorrow". What you're proposing is a "war against reason". Not impossible, sure - I've seen worse things exported from the US.
4. I hear ya - I simply disagree on what your opinion of "down-sides" is.
Also, it's important that you remember that [there are other countries out there]( The US goverment is not the only one. In fact, Bitcoin is 1-0 in terms of goverment acceptance (Finland). You're saying "the point" will never be reached (not a fact), I'm saying "the point" hasn't **yet** been reached (a fact). I paid my taxes (GBP) in bitcoin this month. Sure, I have to convert them to the currency of the local goverment before doing so, but that, for me, is a click of a button. The conversion fee (0.2%) is a claimed expense.

Thanks for the honesty - the rest of the article was a good read so I applaud you for that. Another point of contention: I'm not sure the price of gold halving would have much of an affect on the global economy. Maybe if there were still currencies that were gold-backed, but there really aren't. 
I'd opine that if this were true (e.g. USD was still gold-backed) we probably wouldn't see such a strong emergence of limited-by-design and predictable value stores (currency systems).
@_date: 2012-10-22 11:05:39
1. Using a whole tangible element (Au) as a store of value is bad for our civilization. Gold is really useful, but it's so incredibly expensive (because of speculation) that it could be said that it stumping technological growth.
2. Fear is simply that. Money flows toward value, not away from fear.
3. I'm assuming that you're assuming that the US military will win a fight when pitted against bitcoin? Interesting concept that an army could go up against a protocol or **intangible thing**... In that regard, I predict it will be as successful as its "war on terrorism".
4. Intangibility/virtuality is a good thing (see also 3). You say "flaw", I say "feature". Cool stuff that follows from it is: 
a) (optional) indestructibility (I can destroy mine, if I want to, but not anyone else's).
b) effectively nil-cost storage (compare cost of vaults in banks, Fort Knox etc.)
c) effectively nil-cost usage (compare western union/ paypal money transfers, cost of printing money)
As a protocol we can build cool stuff on top of it. We're barely scratching the surface of its technical possibilities. "Big" players jumping on board really isn't required for success. Success will probably be better defined by adoption of a large number of "small" players.

Don't be silly. Using a vanity address doesn't make other addresses unusable. For example I use: **1SC2BTCkZzrPT6vgwfxn8eNY57b1UBxd6** for [my website]( donation address. This doesn't mean someone can't still use 1SC2BTCwhateverelsegoesintoabitcoinaddress with a different private key for another purpose. Billions of addresses can start with 1SC2BTC. Vanity addresses are not exclusive (like vanity plates on your car). The address mining just spits out the 1st one it finds.
It gets exponentially more difficult the more characters you "mine" for - e.g. getting an address starting with a specific set of 13 characters would require the total hashing output of the current bitcoin network.
For the treasure hunt; You'd have to use more energy than exists in our solar system to accomplish that (33 chars) with current tech (essentially brute-force cracking SHA-256) and it would still take a kazillion years.

I actually tested it, and although the generated code allows changing the data-amount and data-curreny fields, it only updates the visual display of the button - when you click through the price is in the generated value/currency.
You have to use the API to generate a txn, with the amount/current pair - and then use that txnid in the button. You can re-use the txn for multiple payments so you'd have to script one for every product you're selling. The buttons allow for multiple txns to occur on them though.

I'm going to rephrase this sentence to remove the emotionally-laden rhetoric. "According to the Iranian Students' News Agency, Mr Mazloumin and associates had saved the coins to sell at high prices and buy at a lower prices." The two sentences describe the same actions.
Every time I sell a thing I "manipulate" the market price down, every time I buy a thing I "manipulate" the price up. Henceforth I will no longer use the term "saving", I will instead use the term "hoarding". I will call some of my banks today to ask if they can open a hoarding account for me.
EDIT: All the banks offered savings accounts. I can describe their rates as both **abysmal** and **great** - depending on my point-of-view.

Ugh, even with open source solutions out there Apple still manages to make double-spending easy. And how do they try to fix it? Go after the hacker, because he'll obviously be the only one ever to try and hack their payment systems. I think it's time marketing and legal departments GTFO of tech/security, because they are the ones truly screwing things up for the company.

AFAIK BI does not discriminate who uses the bought BTCs, nobody cares (should care) what you do with YOUR money. 
Always be suspicious of anyone who asks "and what are you going to do with it?". Your knee-jerk (and in my opinion: correct) response should always be "go fuck thyself, it's none of your business".

TL;DR: If the few people who own the most bitcoins (~80% not currently in circulation from Ars Technica article) drop all their coins on the market then bitcoin will die.
My opinion: Non-issue  A price drop does not equal a kill, regardless of the size of said price drop (see June/July 2011 bubble pop). 
Unless, of course, I misunderstood the concept of "kill" here. I think the author would do well to define what a "dead" bitcoin protocol is. It would seem that it is when every bitcoin is worth less than a &lt;insert very small amount of USD here/&gt;.

Brilliant, thanks so much for getting back to me. Please let her know that she has full artistic license (use of colour, detail and specific subject(s)) for these creations. I ask only that the wording remain prominent on the slides and the subject be something from the Starcraft universe. I'll PM you my contact details so we can take it from there. Enjoy the wedding and chat soon. Congrats to her brother!
EDIT: Also, if she would like to use the created subjects on her deviantART profile/gallery (without the slide text of course) she's more than welcome to; mostly because I would love to order prints of my first artwork commission. Art is better when it's set free, if she gets any more business from this work, we all win :)
@_date: 2011-05-12 04:57:44
Oh wow, you have a very talented wife. I absolutely love [the ice elemental]( - the clear lines, vivid colours and anime motif fits perfectly with what I'd like to create.
If you two would like to have a look [here's a preview version]( of what I'm creating. I'm talking to someone else for the banner/logo work so I'm looking to fill the steps 1-3 panels with something prettier than just the white text.
This project is self-funded so my budget is limited to about 5.0 BTC per slide (or the equivalent in $, if you can't convince her), more if/when the site has success. There is no rush on delivery as I'd like to launch without these (to get functional/beta testing out of the way). 
If she's interested please let her know that her artwork will of course be fully credited and properly linked. It seems as if she loves her work and we hope to bring more exposure to these talented individuals.
It looks like she's not new to gaming, but if she needs inspiration in the Starcraft 2 context; visit [Blizzard's fan art site](
If you have any feedback on the idea/site/copy itself, I would love to hear from you regardless of whether you choose to go ahead with it.
@_date: 2011-10-13 22:19:14
As long as you're licensed to run the tournaments and their prize money is below $5k it's all good. That said, if Blizzard were to change their EULA to disallow for-money or buy-in tournaments they would essentially kill eSports. The largest SC2 tournament in North America, [MLG]( is a buy-in tournament.

Looks very cool, I like. I decided to go with bespoke-for-Starcraft as it's a great passion of mine. Because it's a game of skill we didn't have to go through the red-tape gambling sites have to submit to, which sped up the process immensely.
We looked @ SC2Ranks and decided to go with our own data-collection direct from the source (battle.net) instead, due to caching issues. The platform does the replay/data collection (for use in research/statistical analysis) for us automatically.

Answer to 1: It's lost forever. Because the currency is divisible to 8 decimals there is no problem. Even if everyone loses all their BTC and only 1 BTC remains, the currency still works fine. Also, if you lose all your BTC, it makes mine worth more, so please forget to back up your wallet.dat :)

I think it's a great idea.
My attempt to help eSports grow: 
It's sort of amazing if you do the math about the potential growth spurt it could initiate; especially with 3 million players who, on average, have decent GPUs.
In its infancy, it's basically a tournament automation platform for Starcraft 2 specifically, which allows sit-and-go style tournaments (similar to online poker). It integrates with the game client by allowing drag&amp;drop match result reporting and automates a bunch of other tedious admin/moderation/refereeing tasks.
We're currently in public alpha testing (got 50 signups on day 1), with a bugfix &amp; feature release coming this weekend.

*The choice is with us still, but the civilization now in jeopardy is all humanity. As the ancient myth makers knew, we are children equally of the earth and the sky.

But we've also acquired compassion for others, love for our children and desire to learn from history and experience, and a great soaring passionate intelligence — the clear tools for our continued survival and prosperity.*

Really really cool, we´re developing this [starcraft 2 tournament web]( and some players have expressed interest in betting on tournament outcomes. We initially thought it might not be a bad idea to implement ourselves, but we´d like to focus on the core development (automation platform and eSports-specific add-ons) as we´re a small team. To compete in the market we´ve had to integrate with already-developed tools to get ahead i.t.o. technology. Do you think you´d be able to put up an API for integration?

It´s ok to mention the zero-cost transaction fees, the "less than  penny" is optional. Come to think of it, if you´d like to make it a little more general, remove the word "penny" completely.

Thank you for the feedback. Yes, wow - that banner font looks horrible now that I look at it... it's illegible and drips of tacky. Changing that to something a little better now...
I've spent so much time in the inner-workings (functional development) of the site that I hardly ever take a step back to just look at it. You're right, it could be much more cohesive. What we went for are pictorials to introduce the 3 main concepts:
1. Bitcoin is used.
2. Tournaments are played.
3. Rewards are earned.
The three steps were (loosely) inspired by the SouthPark underwear gnomes' 4-step business plan.
Did you mean cohesion in terms of colouring or the scene setups for the 3 main slides?

Pooled mining: A certain hashrate guarantees a certain income at any given point in time (see  for current (today) ROI calculations. If you switch on an ASIC machine today, you will get paid tomorrow, guaranteed.


By design, there will be coins left to mine until the year 2140. You should know that ASICs are pretty much the final generation of hardware which our civilization's current technical advancement is capable of producing. It will probably be this way for another decade.


Fair enough. You can offset this risk (running cost) almost completely by running the machine in a country where electricity is free (e.g. Venezuela). Capital investment into a pre-order (pre-trust) is the risk part of the risk/benefit pair here.


Nothing is guaranteed. Everything has risk associated with it. Good companies deliver on their promises. Avalon has, BFL is in-process, ASIC miner runs their own produced machines. Many business models exist. The one which is most sustainable will probably be the most successful.


This has, and always will be, the case. I don't seek to enter into a speculative BTC price debate with you. It bears no fruit. All I know is that the bitcoin protocol (or something similar, but better) is indestructible (distributed, peer2peer) and it will probably exist for as long as human civilization has the internet.
As with all productive debates, it's normally better to be informed about the facts of its topic, before you enter said debate. Some of the statements I made in this post are facts, some are my own opinion. I'll leave it up to you to decide which.
@_date: 2013-03-01 13:18:25
Lost forever and not a problem. Infinite divisibility of any amount of bitcoin means that it can store all past, present and future value that human civilization produces. 
There is no reliable way to determine if any amount of coin was lost, unless you destroyed them yourself; if so: thanks for that - it makes everyone else's holdings more valuable.

Bitcoin as a value store (the function of currency) is capable of storing all human-created wealth: past, present and future. Indefinitely. Someone who "gets into" bitcoin 40 years from now will have "gotten in early" compared to someone who gets in 100 years from now. That's the point.

No. After you click the deposit button you'll be given a reference code which you then use when you make the intl transfer from your own bank account. Bitstamp cannot pull money out of your bank account, you have to send it to them. The reference code means your account will be credited with the money as soon as they receive it from your bank.
@_date: 2013-05-25 13:12:18
There is so much misinformation on your website. The function of XRP is that it is destroyed with use. It was not designed as a value store, people simply use it as such because they have value (and things with value tend to be traded). People try to shoe-horn what they've learnt about bitcoin into ripple, they fail, and they get all cross-eyed and start screaming "scam". 
It's a natural human emotion to fear the unknown and that's fine as well.

Sure, but you losing your money doesn't fuck me over, it helps me (and everyone else). 
Losing any amount of bitcoin does not destroy the value it stored. The value is simply redistributed to all the remaining value-storing bitcoin. We can also assume that this value will tend to zero over time, as better/easier backup/safekeeping services come online.

Dude. Such things are implied, not said. Can you not see the problem with someone saying the words "I'm not a scammer"? What would a scammer say?
I'm not saying you're a scammer, just highlighting why you're going to get laughed at for this comment.
Also, the "can anyone verify the...." bit was for people other than yourself. What you were doing is you're in a room of, say 100 people, and you're selling something. Now someone points at you and asks to the room: "Is this guy a scammer?" and you pipe up and say "I'm not a scammer!". The other 99 people laugh out loud.
A more appropriate response would be "I'm the website owner and I'm happy to answer any questions anyone may have regarding trust or any other topic related to the website".
With irreversible payments it's the onus of the business to cultivate and grow trust. You don't even have to figure out a novel way to get started, just ask a trustworthy person to do a writeup on the experience. But for everyone's sake let me just say that your business model is kinda been-there-done-that with the exception of zero fees.

Editing past transactions is not possible. Doing so will invalidate all information after the edit. Only adding to the ledger (blockchain) is allowed. 
Coincidentally, this allows for some interesting and useful use-cases of the blockchain. E.g. You can absolutely verify that you made a cryptographically signed (impossible to fake) statement on a specific date/time by adding it to the blockchain at that specific date/time. Nobody can change that statement.

:) I actually gave this some thought after saying it.
I live in a country where my taxes get me all sorts of good stuff, health care being one of 'em and military being practically none of it. I can see how Americans and many other countries citizens would be pissed off with their gov for what it's doing and its citizens practicing civil disobedience (not paying taxes).
I would however like to be able to see better where all of it goes, down to the grainiest of details if I so choose. Technically this shouldn't be hard to set up (sort of like a flow-chart of money spent) on top of the bitcoin status-quo, and it doesn't need to be built into the protocol. [Something like this]( - with named nodes. Would work well for charities as well - stuff like public (transparent) accounting.
I guess what I'm trying to say that if if can be shown to governments that bitcoin can be a force for good (e.g. automation of taxation services and other, useful things) then it's another large avenue for adoption, and less friction for growth.

The beauty of bitcoin is that it is open to improvement. If it can be envisaged technically, it can be developed on top of the protocol ([see BIPs]( If not compatible with the protocol (or you're in a rush), you can still develop on top of it. Only then it'll be a service which you have to run.

I'm a South African in Spain. I've used  over the last week to send my parents (in ZA) money for plane tix for them to come visit later this year.
I found it extremely useful to simply send bitcoin to an address, and then less than an hour later they have the equivalent ZAR in their bank account. The fee is 1%, but that's ok, because I simply instruct the exchange to sell them ~1% over the MtGox spot price. And South Africans are buying them at that price :). So, for me at least, transferring money 5000 miles away is free, and pretty much instant.
I totally agree with your take on the taxi example. Cash is King. I've taken my fair share of minibus taxis, but I have to say the last time I had to pay R2 for it (to/from school). That was around 1996. It's interesting that it's now 5x more expensive 17 years later, I guess ~10% annual inflation will do that. Anyhoo, I think the risk/benefit of carrying large (any?) amounts of cash vs. the goverment being able to track your earnings will play a factor in the future. I think they'll be more at risk with thieves seeing their intake than gov, to be honest. In ZA the [$5 wrench attack]( doesn't happen, you're lucky if it's a (free) home-made knopkierie, but more often it's a gun.

I've deposited into it twice from my UK bank account (Natwest), I've never had to give them my banking info (you have to fill in their info into your online banking side when you make the deposit). The bitstamp site gives you the necessary reference numbers, codes and bank account details which your bank will ask you for.

I'll be continuing the conversation with him once things calm down a bit. For me, getting Blizzard/Activision to accept bitcoin, even if it's just a small amount from my side, would be a huge huge deal. Seeds are planted in the strangest places...

I love the blank stares when you (try to) explain to them that their smartphone is singularly powerful enough to generate all the bitcoins in existence. The reason for the current power consumption is because of competition for the production of a valuable resource. If there weren't such competition the entire bitcoin mining network could run on fairy farts and tadpole sneezes alone.
Also, ASICS. I'd like to hear what they have to say about current mints not being bothered about increasing their electric productivity by an order of magnitude in &lt;4 years. So much wasted cotton, plastic, zinc, nickel etc. going into producing old, outdated currencies.

Right. So your argument is that "the existence of rich people who don't squander their money is bad for the economy"?
I have no economic background so I probably shouldn't be debating it. To be perfectly honest I think natural market forces are much better than artificial market forces (printing money at the unpredicatable whim of whomever). That said, I think you're applying oldskool economic theory to 21st century tech. Yes, the dollar is infinitely divisible, but not practically so. Even if only 1 bitcoin were to be the grand total of all bitcoin in circulation it would still have the technical capacity to store all human wealth: past, present and future. It would still be usable as currency by everyone on the planet.
My economic stance? Governments and economists should stop trying to "fix" the global economy and just let it play out naturally.

Thank you for the compliment. I think you'll find many of us hipster bitcoiners (we've been here in since 2009/2010) are predominantly mathematicians or developers, or both. Things have changed a bit this year...
Bitcoin competes in markets which are currently valued in the trillions of USD (e.g. international remittance, online purchases et al.). To do so, its market capitilization *has* to be in the same ballpark. In my opinion, what we're seeing is an adjustment upwards towards that valuation. By design, bitcoin is a perfect value store (the function of currency). It was designed to act as a value store for all human wealth, past, present and future. So that's my take on stability: upward-stability is still stability (just like USD is downward stable by a process called "quantitative easing"). Nothing like it has existed before, so we're very much on the bleeding edge of "value transfer protocol" development. Exciting stuff.
I can easily change *my* BTC to USD at the click of a button. Yes, some exchanges are experiencing issues with granting that liquidity to users simply because they don't have the resources to validate them (for AML legality). Although I certainly agree with you, I consider this a temporary issue, unrelated to the bitcoin protocol itself.
A bit of an open concept but I'll try. For me at least it has been very useful, but I won't make a sweeping statement about it. Merchant adoption is a matter of time really. What percentage of merchants accepted credit cards 4 years after its inception? How many accept them now? What benefits does btc have over credit cards? I've also found that my Euros are utterly useless in most of North America. Bitcoin is, by design, a global "value transfer protocol".
All of this stuff is my opinion only. I've made no attempt to state them as fact. I make no attempt to bring you over to the light side, just a bit of good ol' healthy debate.

The current rate of supply inflation is ~12.22% per annum: ~3600 coins per day /10.75M in existence x 365. This rate exactly halves (from one day to the next) every 4 years. The inflation rate tends to zero in this manner until the year 2140. By design, the supply never deflates - although loss of coins can be construed as deflation.

People are going to give you shit for these never being able to make "your money back", simply because they are butt-sore poopieheads who think they're smarter than everyone.
You see, I did the same thing, sort of. I pre-ordered an Avalon batch  in February for what was then $1500 (~75BTC) and it arrived last Friday. For me, what I did to pay for it was take my fiat directly from my bank account, buy bitcoin with it and pay for the machine. So, for me, my capital investment for ROI calculation is $1500, meaning a ~10-15day ROI. 
What all these butt-sore pooopieheads will tell me is that it'll take much longer to mine the ~75BTC back (about 35-40 days). I say they're fools, because from my point of view the end-to-end $1500 out of bank account, and $1500 back into bank account (+profitable miner) has been achieved. Now the real question is whether/not you should consider the wait time in the ROI as well. Yours is zero, mine was 5 months. 
The butt-sore poopieheads are the ones complaining because they weren't the ones who figured out how to "mine" 1000BTC in 1 day with 330Gh/s, as ASICMINER did with these little beauties. People get trolly when it comes to money, they forget their manners and upbringing. Ignore them, don't feed them.

Bitcoin is not deflationary. The supply inflates to 21 million over time, inflation drops to nil at around 2140, then stops. The supply never deflates.
Bitcoin acts as a value store. Infinitely divisible, it is technically capable of storing all human created value (past, present and future). The increase in value (USD/BTC) which you're confusing with deflation is the current fiat (tending toward value=0) money being "loaded up" into the protocol (exchanging). This will be the case for some time still.
The traditional way of calculating loan percentages will change, sure. As will many things. This can only really be possible when the growth of the economy becomes measureable. What bitcoin does is removes another unknown variable (what will the central banks do?) from this equation. Thus making things much simpler and more stable.

Ok, I should have been more clear. 
By "nothing is guaranteed" I meant "quick profit" (the context you established) is not guaranteed.
What is guaranteed is "some income", where you said "never generate a coin".
**The machines don't guarantee profit, they guarantee income. There's a difference.** Right now they're very profitable, this may not be the case 3 years from now. I can only speak for now mostly because I'm unable to predict the future and/or the USD price of BTC, like everyone on planet earth.

Yep, remember Murphy wrote this in 2002. This was long before publically viewable, virtual, provably fair and anonymous value-transfer was available for use. The proof of payment is no longer a concern as the blockchain is both public and impossible to change.
I've read Bell, but the thing I get stuck on why it wouldn't work is what happens if a target fakes their own death and claims the bounty? If the target then goes public, the validity of subsequent listings would be void.
Nevertheless, sounds like an interesting software development project for a bored developer in a recession... Maybe not Assasination Politics per se, maybe something tamer like "Pie in the face", "Black Eye" or "Paintball to the face" Politics would sit better as a new class of "gambling" software.

It won't :)
Ripple does not enforce repayments, it simply enables lines of credit to be established, so don't extend trust to someone you don't trust.
Conversely, it can also act as a universal coupon system (each exchange has their own implementation which is only good in one place). The example cited in all the explanations is a little basic, I've spent some time with a bit of integration code and it still boggles my mind how ingeneous it really is and how many disparate financial transcactions can be modelled with it - the ripple guys are doing really good work and are very very helpful. This will change the money transfer status-quo and help along the "uploading" of oldskool fiat into bitcoin, in my opinion.

Limited to elec industry unless it becomes a trend I guess. Many people take their lead from pioneers. A pioneer in my mind is someone who can walk the walk indefinitely and prosperously.
I believe sustained growth into an actual competitor using the same profit margins is the best way to make a real statement about real business. I worked in pricing in a professional industry (travel &amp; hospitality IT) a while back, and it needed to be said that Pricing 101: don't slash prices to prove a point. Competitors are frenemies, they need to be. They can't collude, by law, but if you cut one or more throats you should be prepared to get cut as well.
I must say I have no thoughts/opinions on bitspend because I simply don't know about them. EDIT: Ah, right - bitspend would have to automate really well to build a sustainable business. It's a cool idea, but probably won't garner a massive crowd/following.

Not an expert here, but wouldn't it be *electronic* engineering instead? I thought *electrical* engineering pertains to large-scale electric ops for setting up power grids and such. Just don't want the guy to be going for 6 years and then not be able to do it :)
Ugh, I remember a couple of months of an electronics for dummies in my 3rd year of physics. Gates, resisitors, capacitors, bread boards... Calculations never made sense and the diagrams looked like pizza from afar, but the tiny bits all meant something. That shit is hard man.
That said, a hobbyist working hard on it for a year and focusing only on that could probably put together a prototype miner. I'd pay to see a bread board miner in action...

Perfectly true statement. What you forgot to inform everyone about is that Bitcoin actively destroys its direct competitors (those that are backed by computational power). The protocol obviously isn't designed that way, but it's easy for a mining pool to temporarily redirect computational power to any up-and-coming competitor (toward its destruction - see: 51% attack). It happens because people have a tendency to protect their investments. 
Weird (and wonderful) things become possible when you have a distributed supercomputer which is ~4 times more powerful than the top 500 supercomputers on planet earth (combined).
Also, I'm not married to bitcoin so when/if something superior to bitcoin comes along i'll get me some of that as well :)

I agree with you on all accounts. The issue I take with these wasted-energy articles is that they compare it to completely unrelated things. I see no stats on energy consumption of zinc, nickel, cotton and gold (et al) mining operations so the numbers quoted are meaningless (to me). I say this because that's one of the problem spaces in which bitcoin competes (global cash).
As it's all fair game on non-sensical comparisons we could make the statement that "the most powerful single-purpose distributed supercomputing network Human civilization has ever produced currently uses about half the power of the LHC @ CERN". Two cutting-edge, potentially civilization-advancing experiments using less than power than 100k US homes? Wow, that's actually extremely energy efficient. 
The context not mentioned in the article is that there are ~125 million houses in the US, so the energy in question is 36000/125000000, or 0.0288% of US household electricity consumption.

It's resource shortages mostly, after the government pretty much took over whichever companies opposed them poltically. They export the crude oil, and then buy the refined petrol on the open market (after they canned 15000 people working for PDVSA). They then give said refined oil to the people, for practically free (a full tank of gas will cost you about $1). This subsidy extends to other energy provisions as well, bleeding the country dry.
The government mandates a USD&lt;-&gt;VBL exchange rate which is what must be used for importing goods, problem being that it's much lower than the actual (parralel/black market) exrate so the gov has to make up the diffs when companies buy the import good. So now government is involved in the supply of goods, inefficiency and the lack of unlimited value (go figure) leads to a severely limited supply of stuff to buy. Necessary things, like toilet paper and coffee (which the country used to export, but no longer produces).
Add in rampant political craziness and subsequent power vacuum after Chavez's departure and it's a big ol' stew of "the next Zimbabwe".
Bitcoin is a natural evolution under currency pressure. It's adoption in South America is inevitable as a result.

Your guarantee as stated has no validity in this new world.
All that stuff is already taken care of. If you want to run it anonymously (i.e. without fear of reprisal, legal or otherwise) it's prefectly possible by using tech developed by the US Military (see Tor, Silk Road).
The FBI is quite limited in 
1. jusrisdiction 
2. inability to brute-force crack sha256 (as is NSA, CIA and all other entities which use computers which occupy space &amp; time as we know it).
3. the proposed specification is perfectly legal (as stated) - you'll have to deal with lawyers 1st before the FBI will even consider going after it. And then (probably?) also only after getting rid of Hitler/Robert Mugabe equivalents.

Look, all I'm saying is that a bit of dissent and controversy is always good for any concept. We're human and most people on here are open-minded. 
It is fair enough to assume that only irrational thinkers (termed in this post as idiots) need something simple to jog their thinking a bit. This was almost it. The problem is, that most idiots won't read past something which calls them an idiot in the title.

This same question is asked many times a week on the subreddit. That's perfectly fine, especially with the influx of so many new users. The problem with the question is that it is extremely speculative. I guess that's what makes it so fun to post about - it's a great chin-wag because it has no conclusion. 
Therefore, I retract my weariness. Your questions are valid and interesting and everyone should give them serious thought. But they must realise that they are a part of this world and everyone may take steps to mold it into something different, hopefully better.

Bitcoin is a protocol, it has no political agenda. 
The problem isn't with rich people/ banking system having all the money. It's that they got that way by stealing money from other people. Bitcoin prevents this absolutely.

I understand that there are people on this planet that are simply classified as "unmensch". I've met 3 in my entire life, of which you're the 3rd. Though I must say I'm glad I've not actually met you.
That they would go out of their way to (publically) advertise it as such is simply beyond me, as it serves no purpose and earns no profit. You're the first of the 3 who does this. The other two died at early ages of heart problems, and their families were too busy to attend their funerals, or simply could not be bothered.

The major problem with bitcoinstore's approach to it is that they simply see it as a competition of price. It's not just that, and it's naive to think it.
I order from Amazon because of their amazing customer-service, no-nonsense returns policy and quick delivery. Also, zero customs costs when I order from Amazon UK to Spain, with free delivery to Spain on orders over £25. This even though there's now an Amazon.es.
Sure, my example is but one drop in the bucket. But we really should not kid ourselves that bitcoinstore is anywhere near on-par with Amazon's delivery. It isn't. It's latest publicity stunt of taking 0% profit to force the big ones to cave in is silly. Won't work. It's unsustainable and makes the assumption that everyone will just switch because the prices are cheaper. As any marketer will tell you that is complete and utter bullshit.
WTB: Business-minded people who aren't also naive and who realise that setting a new company's profits to nil does not make it compete with a global player. Initiating price-erosion will irritate the big players at best.

I think it would be counterproductive if you were to extend help. Not really sure how it works with ASICs, but I would imagine that (as with most new technology) there's some leeway i.t.o. design and solving the same problem in a different way and sometimes it's these differences which lead to better tech in the long run.

Growing up in South Africa I regularly saw the government increase the repo-rate (base loan/interest rate) to strengthen the currency. The reasoning was that higher interest rates stimulated investment.
What you're saying is that high interest rates are bad, I'm saying they could be good. What an investor would probably say is that it's all relative. e.g. As long as the interest on a loan is more than that which could be earned from holding on to the bitcoin (saving), it's all good for all parties involved (the point of economic engagement). The requirement is stability and predictability so that risk/reward calculations become easier.
