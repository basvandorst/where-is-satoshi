Have you looked at coinmarketcap? Almost every altcoin is green...

To preface my comment let me say I didn't obtain my bitcoin from an exchange so I've never actually had to deal with coinbase/gdax/etc. So my question involves selling bitcoin (an unfathomable idea I know). When you sell on an exchange do you obtain the $ amount of bitcoin at the exact time of sale or do you get the $ amount bitcoin is worth once it finally arrives onto your account/bank account? Essentially if you want to sell at a hypothetical peak will you be guaranteed to get that $ amount immediately? I've tried searching for this info but all I can find is that exchanges take like 3-5 days to transfer $ into your bank account. Thanks so much if you get the time to reply to this comment!

Can someone correct me if my logic is off here: Wallstreet is pumping bitcoin hard to gain an advantage on their short position once futures roll out. Then the whales will dump their coins and rake in the profits if the price tanks. So hypothetically the only way this WONT happen is if the common public/average joe are buying into bitcoin at a high enough rate to cancel out the huge dump offs? Why wouldn't dumping bitcoin at the peak and rebuying after the price correction be a good idea?

Max daily withdrawal amount is $10k with a standard gdax account (which would amount to roughly .6 bitcoin). You have to provide additional bank information/linkedin account to increase the daily max withdrawal amount.

Thank you!!

its pretty sobering when you see a red sell wall drop the price by over $1k in less than a minute

I haven’t used the site in almost 3 years so I’m not sure if that’s still an option or not. But back then you could.

Same. Won a big sports bet on Bovada and cashed out in bitcoin. Been riding the wave ever since. No sports bet will ever match the rush of holding bitcoin during the 2017 run.

can anyone explain why alt coins (bitcoin cash/gold) are going insane right now?

This strategy is increasingly difficult for college graduates with 6 figure student debt and jobs without matching 401Ks. By the time student loans are paid the expenses of the next stage in life begin: house, car, family, etc. Its tough to create a nest egg for investing when it takes you into your 40s to achieve some form of financial freedom.

Another noob here. So I've had bitcoin in a wallet for about a year and I haven't touched it. Does this mean that every time there is a fork I will also then have the same amount in bitcoin cash, segwit2x, etc?

BITCOIN CASH QUESTION: So I am a noob with bitcoin and I heard that if you had bitcoin in a wallet before the fork that means you also have bitcoin cash? I have a few bitcoins in my copay wallet and was wondering how exactly you can get access to bitcoin cash (if this is even possible). Thanks!

My damn OCD keeps costing me money. About a year ago when bitcoin was hovering around $700 I decided to cash out a few bitcoins from online gambling. So instead of leaving to full amount in my wallet I decided to round DOWN to a whole number of bitcoin.....those "scraps" are now worth almost 2X more than the original amount I put into bitcoin :(

Amazing. In your opinion do you think these smaller cryptos have a future? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:16:57
So does the same thing apply to bitcoin gold?
