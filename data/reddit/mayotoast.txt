@_date: 2015-04-08 09:47:11


Wrong subreddit to post according to Aussiehash. Any idea where can i do the next one?
@_date: 2015-04-08 09:07:27
Nope. Non American. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:20:21
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:07:52
Lol nice try 
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:20:21
While waiting for startfruit's confirmation to go through, 
Let's play a game  at 
That way when the last coin holder goes offline, game can still continue and play out when coinholder returns.
@_date: 2015-04-08 09:27:01
Got to go soon. This celebrity had her dance move replicated in a game. There, that should do it.
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:06:07
Fuck the rules I wanna go to bed! 
@_date: 2015-04-08 05:32:25
Answer is a single word

No idea that you are still passing it on. Just set up a account, let me try it out by tipping $1 on you. Not sure if thats the way you do it!
@_date: 2015-04-08 04:04:22
Go on one last try 
@_date: 2015-04-08 05:45:36
Agreed. Look at Phil Zimmerman getting into so much trouble creating pgp. He might be humble but my guess is also to avoid such troubles. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 05:08:22
Wow I should have chosen him. Love that guy
@_date: 2015-04-08 05:07:45
