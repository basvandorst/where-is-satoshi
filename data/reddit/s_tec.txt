They are brokers, rather than exchanges. Unlike an exchange, where you maintain balances in different currencies, these partners will pull dollars straight from your bank account and deposit bitcoins straight to your Airbitz wallet (or vice-versa). We want you to maintain control of your Bitcoins at all times.
On the other hand, these partners are hosted and centralized. That's pretty much the only way to interface with the legacy financial system, unless you want to go the localbitcoins route.

If you go to the "Receive" tab in AirBitz and hit the import button, you can scan the Blockchain private key printouts to load the funds (I'm the guy who wrote that feature into AirBitz).

It does a sweep. Hrm, maybe "import" is the wrong word to be using here.

The funds are stored on your phone, and AirBitz is a backup. If you lose your coins at the same time the backup service goes down, there is not much you can do to get them back.
AirBitz does support paper backups (it's on the wallet screen), but our keys are in a weird non-standard format. The tool to extract the private keys from the backup is  We have plans to port things over to BIP 39 at some point, but it's a big refactor.
In any case, this is better than storing your Bitcoins in a bank like Coinbase. If they go down, you lose everything.

Our notion is that people shouldn't have to worry about backups, and that the reset feature should be enough. We see the backup as more of a power-user thing.

Yes, that's right. The server data is useless without the username and password, and AirBitz doesn't have either of those. We run the password through ~1/2 second of scrypt (adjusted based on phone speed) before using it as an encryption key, so it's pretty hard to brute-force. Faster phones get more security.
We don't have a BIP 39 export yet, since that didn't exist when we did our design, but we do export the BIP 32 entropy as a hex string. That's enough to get you keys back if everything goes down.
I make most of my payments by scanning on-screen QR codes. Most websites provide a payment QR code, and if they don't, I can easily get one using any block-explorer site. To go the other way, I use the "email" button on the AirBitz receive screen.
A PC version would be nice, but we would rather spend our limited resources working on things like multi-sig, better password recovery, BIP 39 export, and so forth.

Hey, I'm the developer who wrote this feature. If you pull our your barcode scanner app, and look at that token, you'll see something like KOB5S7OTUNKQ7DQQ. This is the base32 secret key used to generate the 6-digit codes. If you paste it into your normal Google Authenticator app, you can actually generate the codes yourself.
If you want to make a backup, just save this key somwhere. To restore a backup, just turn the key back into a QR code and scan it.
Source code for the code generatior is here:

If you want to make a backup, just scan that QR code and save it somewhere. To restore, just turn the key back into a QR code and scan it.
The quick &amp; dirty way is webqr.com, although it's obviously not the most secure option. It's obviously better to run software on your own computer.

2fa is only relevant for the first login on a new device. Once the login completes, the app downloads all your data and saves it locally. From that point on, you can log in and send funds without any further assistance from the AirBitz servers. You can try this for yourself by putting your phone in airplane mode and doing a password login.
The 2fa reset would only be an issue if AirBitz goes down *and* you lose your phone simultaneously.
