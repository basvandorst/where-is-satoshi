this should be done on an app though 
user puts 100 - $1000 worth of bitcoin into a wallet that broadcasts 30km in the area "willing to sell at X amount for cash" 
Then other users in the area can opt in to message the seller and arrange meeting at a coffee shop or something. 
Im really suprised people are scaling up ATMs and shit when an app for p2p trading under $2,000 is what MOST people need in their area.
Note: Im a hodler but I would totally throw a few hundred in a wallet from time to time when I could use a few bucks for walking around money. Im sure retailers would use this to sell bitcoin too in cities.

Bitcoin doesnt care what the address holder wants or does with their bitcoin, bitcoin just stores value and allows it to be transferred between two parties without requiring intermediaries. 
You dont have a CEO or administrator to choose whats allowed and what isnt, or who can hold money and who cant. That's how money is supposed to work.

That's more to sell a miner though, I want to know what the average miner earnings 
daily for miners
divided by number of miners (on average, perhaps based on nodes running) for each day
Then you have this floor that miners just stop mining. Some suggest 3k to mine a bitcoin is still possible if you are smart about electricity, meaning bitcoin hitting $2k becomes extremely unlikely.

Banks exist to maximize profit for share holders 
Bitcoin exists to store and transfer "value" between two parties without requiring intermediaries 
Banks will have to continually adapt to the low cost and easier to use solutions bitcoin offers it's holders. Bitcoin doesn't need to adapt to what the banks want it to because different political views want different amounts of control over everyone's money.

The floor for miners cost is around $5k in most areas, so up to the halvening they have to prepare for that to increase to $7-8k to mine a coin... 
If you're planning to hodl more than a couple years, this is an easy buy. There can only be so much chop from the traders, the miners are the ones that NEED to sell bitcoin at certain points or go broke.
You're still sitting pretty (imo) at hodling what you currently have. Buying bitcoin should only revolve on how much dirty fiat we feel like cleaning up during the bottoms.

Bitcoin - anyone with access to the internet can hold and send the currency 
Banks - you need to give them your ID, pay whatever fees they charge to store your money, live in the country (obv), send money to places they agree you are allowed to send your money AND pay the fees (they change) whenever they want. 
Bitcoin - you send the money by having access to the internet (phones are cheap almost everywhere). You hold the money by just accessing the asset however you stored it. 
One requires you to do the things the gatekeepers tell you to do to be allowed in their club. Bitcoin IS similar to that but you can go back to the fiat world in bitcoin easily or into the "crypto" world to get scammed if you want.... bitcoin doesnt care what you do with your bitcoin.

stocks and bonds are valued in fiat though... to not see that fiat is over valued (while being affected by inflation) is to not truly understand bitcoin 
Everything has to go down in value if they need to change the way money and debt are printed, this is almost certainly happening in the 20's....
We are at $250 Trillion in Global Debt. You cannot solve that problem by printing fiat currency. This is the macro problem that very smart economists have said for the last two years will require interest payments higher than the actual debt sooner rather than later. 


His thesis is not BITCOIN SOLVES THIS. The economists at the IMF and World bank do NEED to solve this though. They will probably create a new asset class they try to instill confidence in somehow, whether the masses believe them or not is another thing. 
The gold bugs think its going to be gold, we obviously want it to be bitcoin but the IMF and World Bank are almost certainly going to create something "crypto" to instill confidence in a financial system that is about to take a haircut.

Im arguing that too much debt was created by governments, in addition to the inflation the central bank hides from the holders of national currencies. It is not in the best interest of the holders of money to know what inflation targets are being set, what stocks to pick, which assets to invest in.
Nor is it in their best interest to pay people to tell them what to do with their money. People just want money they can trust, so we arent bartering. Look at the Bolivar or Argentine Peso right now... its insane. 
**The US Dollar has lost 95% of its value since it's creation**
If you havent studied anything based in Austrian Economics then you would not know where I am coming from. Universities like to sell degrees based on Keynes theories that worked 100 years ago for money, they are not working now though and most economists are aware of this. 
They cant instill confidence after this $250 Trillion is "reset." Something needs to take a hit and its not going to be gold or bitcoin 
It will be bonds most likely since the rating agencies are as rigged as the ones that rated CDOs in 2008. Dont even pretend that money is staying the same though, you are just getting left behind by not realizing its going to happen. 
Too many people are poor and want confidence in something, if the central banks can instill that great, if they can't people pick their own money. 
Not letting governments print debt is the first step to sound money for the people though

There is $250 Trillion in Global Debt that needs a solution printing paper money wont solve... 
You should buy gold or bitcoin and understand Austrian Economics before assuming that this money printing that has gone on for 100 years will continue the way has for long. 
The Federal Reserve Bank is the 3rd Central bank of the USA, the first two failed. Banks and the currencies they print historically have failed for many reasons and we are about to run into a currency crisis. Economists have been talking about this openly for 12 months. 


They charge fees to do things that bitcoin has already proven can be done at WAY lower to no cost... 
Banks will have to compete on fees with something like bitcoin. I realize bitcoin isnt the easiest money... Ive sent $200 to China from the US in 10 minutes though.... WAY easier than a bank would do.... they would ask me who the person is, sending branch, routing number, how to spell that chinese name in the different language... 
Bitcoin asks me what address is receiving the bitcoin and sends the person who can access that address the money I wanted to send them. That IS the killer app of bitcoin and I love it. 
Banks now have to convince their customers the fees they charge, which bitcoin proves can be done cheaper, still have to be charged and increase in some cases... how can they do that? Its not a cost to send money or hold money digitally to them, they can only lend money in the future. AND they need to show increased profits to shareholders somehow, that's how the banks work. 
You can't possibly see how maybe its going to be tough for them with bitcoin just EXISTING.... I dont even care about adoption taking 30 years for 1 billion people... the fact it does what it does so cheap and they are so expensive and hard to deal with gives me so much hope for people finally getting sound money. 
I'll hold bitcoin to 0, I really dont give af about the fiat, its so obvious they charge for things for no fucking reason other than "we have a monopoly" lol

To add to this, banks already do this by charging $20 - $50 when sending wires. 
I've sent "money" (bitcoin) to China for $0.00002 fee. Figure out how to wire $200 to someone in China, the names arent in characters we use, the currency conversion to Yuan, the banking system doesn't use routing numbers and identifiers the West uses. 
You can be 5 years old with a cell phone and put a bitcoin wallet on the phone in China and I can send you $200 in few hours, if not minutes. You cant do "address to address" like that with our banking system and never will be able to, they need to track it all for "safety" (lol) 
That alone is something that "some" people find useful over time that grows or they dont. I think its useful and have also sent money "address to address" in Japan, USA, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Germany and UK... I saved tons of transaction fees not going through the banking system 
I know for a fact kids from Asia going to school in the West use bitcoin all the time to transfer money, there arent cheaper ways with low fees available

I'd start a new blockchain with the same protocol the core team is building and securing currently around 2100 
Then some people/miners can move onto the "new" bitcoin (cheaper, less blocks solved, less initial adoption) and some stay on the "old" bitcoin blockchain over the next 100 years with the mining fee solution 
There will be better ideas that what I would do by that time though. 
Heck sometimes I think Nations should start blockchains using the bitcoin protocol and mine a national bitcoin in their country that can be swapped for other national bitcoin currencies OR the bitcoin we all know and love today.

Lots of people saw that $1,000 all time high in 2013 as the beginning of the end....but bitcoin didn't die...
It only gained strength with every block solved...because that's what bitcoin was designed to do. 
If $20,000 actually becomes similar, to the 2013 crash from $1,000, lots of people are going wish they realized what bitcoin was built to do right NOW. It just stores value and allows it to be transferred between two parties without requiring 3rd parties.

Do you know how money works? That money is created when borrowers give money to banks, they get to create more money because they have someone elses money.... its stupid. 
Whereas a system like gold that monarchs and later central bankers used for settlement was in place to make sure that a middleman couldnt get out of line... until Nixon broke the gold standard obviously... we needed it at one point but not before those glorious 80s where bankers oddly became millionaires and billionaires easier every year.... 
Bankers are paid millions/billions to move digits from one ledger to another and pretend this benefits society as a whole. It doesn't benefit society when computers can move the digits between people easily... Thats what bitcoin solves. 
The miners of bitcoin get paid to move bitcoin, while acquiring more bitcoin... which is open source and known to all... so that the middleman isnt needed.  
What happens when the paper money goes away and everything is digitized? Are we supposed to trust the digital ledgers that the banks claim are "good" and kept up? We all know one or two banks are huge ponzis.... Deutsche Bank comes to mind... HSBC and all their drug laundering comes to mind... 
This isn't "tin foil hat" stuff, there's NO REASON to print paper/plastic money and haul it with trucks to cash machines so people can go and access their money from gate keepers in a cartel. 
Its digital already obviously... we dont need a print out of the fucking thing to hand to someone... thats stupid in places where phones are cheap.

Coinbase are scummy because they follow all of the USA regulators draconian laws for users data/tracking, while profiting off "new coin" launches like bcash. Pretty sure there are lawsuits outstanding still about how they pumped bcash or users couldnt access or sell their bcash coins for months after that bitcoin fork.
All exchanges will come under scrutiny for how much their fees are or how much they shill "crypto" bs, Coinbase is one that doesn't appear completely clean to say the least.

An exchange and a bank are similar when buying/selling currencies -- they are taking a fee.

Canada was caught after telling a world bank or imf conference they had been "testing" a crypto -- at least two years ago if not three. That one and Sweden are almost certainly going with crypto, and France announced they are going to have a digital currency a few days ago.

We are moving to second layers and side chains for "payments" over the next decade. Look at lightning network and liquid for two examples, we expect a few competitors to pop up as time goes on. 
Dollars wont matter just like they didn't when bitcoin went from $1000 to $5000 in "value." There are use cases central banks will NEVER EVER believe people just might want, that exclude them and the revolving governments they serve. 
Everyone knows the ponzi that the Fed owns and controls will have to die at some point, or we play the Yuan vs Dollar vs Euro vs Pound game for decades (leaving out tons of currencies obv fighting for "value") 
Most of us convert to dollars as a last resort while we wait for the inevitable lol

NO. Proof of work replicates the mining of gold, USD was tied to gold (for good reason) and removed in the 70's so Nixon could afford to keep bombing Vietnam.

COBOL was created to take the analogue financial system and make it digital 
Bitcoin was created to take the internet and digital "things" into account from the beginning. How would someone create a "store of value," if they were starting from 0 with our existing technology. 
COBOL is how to take a bunch of bullshit IOU's that Keynesian's wrote and make them digital. The debt is $250 Trillion globally remember, those IOU's aren't actually getting paid EVER. 
They are DIFFERENT systems. 
You would need to merge (devalue) the existing currencies on the existing system to 0, over a period, as you increase the usability of the new system (2nd layers, side chains etc). 
You don't move the existing (bad) system on to the new system that is better, the old system dies over a LONG period (possibly a century)

under $500, we really need P2P apps that people can just meet and exchange with no fee, maybe an in app feature of $5 to unlock the first meet then the app is free 
These amounts are tiny but I'd carry $500 or $1,000 in a custodial wallet (hate custodial wallets) if there were people that just wanted to dump the dirty fiat in their city and Im in their area.  
Exchanges and ATM's are just so clueless how irrelevant the smaller amounts need to be to keeping customers in their platform. That dollar or two isn't going to make a dent in their business and its just annoying to the customer more than anything (along with kyc obv)

Bitcoin wasnt made for US citizens with their fancy banking 
Going into 2020 watch the Venezuelans (hopefully) get a currency, Argentina lost 90% of it's spending power with their peso this last decade. 
The Indonesian Rupiah and Indian Rupee have both been worse than shit coins to hold this last decade. Americans dont have these kind of problems with the dollar.

get the mycelium wallet and use the local trader app. It has a 1% fee and lets buyers/sellers message through the bitcoin wallet
If you want to buy or sell you can do it through the app in your store with bitcoiners, not everyone is going to use a bitcoin atm. I just think the fees are really high and the boxes take up a lot of space, some app will pop up as "the one" at some point Im sure and just take over.

People on different platforms will see different propaganda (and be censored differently) as long as these platforms are popular 
There is no solution that works for everyone. You have wealthy groups (including governments) wanting to push different agendas as content throughout facebook, instagram, google, youtube, television and print media. That is where peoples eye balls are and how you get your agenda talked about.

which wallet do you use for your bitcoin to be held in? 
I suggest breadwallet to newbies for small amounts because it is close to stupid proof.
 
Go here 
Enter the bitcoin address you expect to receive bitcoin and see what the miners show on the blockchain for that address. 
There will be confirmations by different miners over a period of time, while the block is solved that your transfer is in.

Why do you want a dollar? You dont control it, you take it cause the government prints it to collect taxes. That is why the Euro exists. It collects European taxes. 
But the Euro (valued against the dollar) is 20 years old and has bailed out 5 European countries banking systems already. Bitcoin has existed 11 years and every bank and government has said its not going to last. 
Do your own reading on what you should value as money but people (all 7 billion) will value what they trust and derive the most value from over time and it is not something governments or banks force people to value.

Why should I only hold my hard earned money for a few months before a central banker decreases it's spending power? 
I should be able to use the money as a "store of value" like gold, which has had relatively the same spending power for centuries


That's less than 3% of the population using that currency daily, what about the rest of the world ? The US looks out for  not the billions globally that use money daily. 


I believe that people will value things that give them easy access to transact (globally) as time goes on. That's it. It could be gold for all I know. I would swap my bitcoin for gold in that scenario. 
I know it wont be a central banks money because open source code can serve everyone equally. People can change digital money if the code changes at any time. 
A central bank has an agenda to collect the governments taxes, that pay interest on the governments debt.....taxes dont pay for anything more than government debt and we all know this

well meetups in most major cities just happen anyways and I always suggest hitting those for p2p purchases. 
Im thinking of doing something where its like yik yak anonymous msging on a "board" in your area/country, an faq for noobs, messaging app and a wallet so exchanges can happen nearby if the users want to share nearby location data. 
The only problem is if the p2p (no kyc) aspect and a crypto messaging board would be enough to draw in customers who are willing to do 1% fee up to $500 - $1000 in trading before the app is zero fees "unlocked" (if that makes sense) 
like its still centralized and has a high cost to make something that scales but dont want users to have lifetime fees like brick and mortar exchanges / ATMs are doing

you arent even trying 
P2P transfers of "value" without requiring intermediaries 
Bank fees suck, paying to have a bank account sucks -- you get to hold bitcoin just by having internet access
Transferring money through a bank/finance company has fees and rules that these companies MUST abide by in order to be the rent seeking bastards they are. Moving digital "things" costs 0, in case music and movie file sharing hadn't made that clear. 
Bitcoin costs less a penny for most of us to send any amount from America to China, to India or Argentina. 
Find a bank that lets you do that without the receivers bank acct number, name, address, purpose of sending the funds. For less than $50 to wire internationally, banks in Asia the systems/languages just do not connect with the west. They can get it done but the fees are insane. 
Bitcoin wants the receivers address and amount, then the miners do the work.

Oh and they didnt make a shit load off of bcash being a fork of bitcoin and not letting customers withdrawal their funds...nope nothing to see there... just trust coinbase and everything will be fine /s 
Not your keys not your coins. 
Just move btc to a wallet exchanges dont control (custodial wallets) for your own piece of mind OR never ever complain about getting robbed by an exchange.
Bitcoin is a decentralized store of value, the protocol allows users to transfer "value" between each other without requiring permission or approval from 3rd parties. You want to trust someone (custodial wallet, bank, exchange) to hold on to the value you have stored, that's your fucking problem, not ours.

Forgot to answer your questions when commenting below :) 


Depends on your risk tolerance, many people want to do 2 confirmations with a stranger (30 mins probably, the chain activity differs obv). Breadwallet shows a conf is coming almost instant when Ive used it, that isn't an actual confirmation though


That's on the business owner to figure out how they want their businesses to buy and sell bitcoin. I would use breadwallet personally and cover customer funds personally, that's 100% not the way other people would want to do it. Hell I would sell bitcoin if people wanted to buy it from my business, probably not even legal in many countries. 


The wallets take the USD rates from the api's offered by exchanges buying and selling. The sender and receiver can open there wallets at the same time to see what $50 is in btc before the transfer. 


not sure what that is, businesses generally can't speculate on a difficult (and rare) currency that others are adopting. 
You have less than 1% of the world owning bitcoin and every business has employees, suppliers, contractors, governments wanting the National currency. It makes sense to only hodl 50% of bitcoin earned and swap the other to fiat for almost EVERY business.
