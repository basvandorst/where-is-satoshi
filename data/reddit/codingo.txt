Not in this manner. Passively and among friends, sure. But in a professional interview and in such a crazy rage? Fuck off mate, doesn't happen every day!
@_date: 2014-08-20 05:49:19


Nor a surprise, really.

Thankfully for an individual to hit the CGT limit you need to transact more than $10,000. A better source then me, can be found [here](

They have somewhat of a history of blocking Bitcoin applications. There's a whole range of reasons, and I certainly think there's a reasonable possibility that they would block them.
@_date: 2014-08-20 11:39:31
No, they have said it's not retrospective (there's a soundcloud link to this elsewhere in this thread)
@_date: 2014-09-03 01:02:57
For now. A lot more likely to be banned if it's competing directly with Google, on a Google product.
@_date: 2014-08-26 11:30:25
It certainly puts a wrench in the works for a lot of charity efforts also. I've been talking with one recently and hope to provide them with some guidance but it looks like they'll be in a difficult position if they try to publish a wallet address and will instead need to do something along the lines of a Wikipedia type approach.

I spoke with Coinjar, but no advice yet. They're apparently releasing a statement on their blog in the coming days once they've had a proper chance to review the rulings.

The full correspondence I received from the ATO was:
From: Bitcoin
Subject: ATO releases guidance on the taxation treatment of bitcoin [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]
Date: Wed, 20 Aug 2014 04:39:10 +0000
Hello everyone,
 
The ATO has just released the guidance paper on the taxation treatment of bitcoin, and a series of draft public rulings. The guidance paper is a simple explanation of the taxation treatment for most common transactions while the public rulings give more involved legal analysis. We are accepting comment on the public rulings. The guidance paper will be updated, if required, once we publish finalised versions of the rulings.
 
Enclosed is a copy of the guidance paper for your reference. It can also be found at  and the draft public rulings can be located using the following links:
 
Income tax:  is Bitcoin a ‘foreign currency’ for the purposes of Division 775 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (ITAA 1997)?
 
Income tax:  is Bitcoin a CGT asset for the purposes of subsection 108-5(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (ITAA 1997)?
 
Income tax:  is Bitcoin trading stock for the purposes of subsection 70-10(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (ITAA 1997)?
 
Fringe benefits tax:  is the provision of Bitcoin by an employer to an employee in respect of their employment a property fringe benefit for the purposes of subsection 136(1) of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986?
 
Goods and services tax: the GST implications of transactions involving bitcoin
 
We have also advised the community via facebook and twitter, with the hashtag 
 
Thank you for your interest in the taxation treatment of crypto-currencies and, for many of you, the contributions that you made in developing the guidance paper and draft rulings. Your expert knowledge and legal analysis, and your willingness to share your knowledge as well as other general information, has helped to produce good advice within the existing legal framework.
 
If you have comments on the draft rulings, please take time to provide the feedback.

Yup. $1 @_date: 2014-09-15 11:22:14
Weird. I got it also (proof:  and only had to provide a postal address. I did ask for it for review purposes though, so maybe I had a totally different form to you?
@_date: 2014-08-20 13:31:41
Apples and oranges. There's a lot more delegation and regulation considerations in traditional sectors then crypto currency also. They both have a number of challenges and difficulties but none of this should impact your priorities for the user - these are technical and business problems, unrelated to the user expectations / experience (which foremost should be protect my money / don't allow others to take my money).
@_date: 2014-08-20 08:58:01


Not too surprising as it likely would have been passed around internally to be resolved breaking the communication loop you had going with support. Still a shame though.
@_date: 2014-08-20 13:58:48
A few points (not shots, just professional opinion):
- You should probably list the program with Crowd Curity more visibly. I don't think it's fair to say this as a reminder when nobody else in the thread just shy of almost a hundred comments mentioned it at all. I think that's a fair indication that this is far beyond public knowledge (at this point, definitely something it looks like you plan to make inroads on).
- Although there are better ways that the original poster should have handled this I think it is fair to say that this is the direct result of poor customer service. I don't think you can entirely blame him given the communication trail. There are certainly far worse ways he could have approached this. That said, I don't condone his going after you personally as this is a company issue, not your issue, regardless of your job title.
Once again, I think people should realize this is a Blockchain issue, not your issue. Once you were aware of this you handled it very professionally and it looks like you will continue to do so - that needs to be something people keep in mind and if the discussion continues it should be about Blockchain making a mistake here, not you.
@_date: 2014-08-20 09:05:22
Maybe at the time of writing, but I wouldn't send something only to that address if you have to dig so hard to find it.
@_date: 2014-08-20 08:49:45
Nice catch, I do wonder if this will be changed though - very positive for individuals.
@_date: 2014-09-09 08:24:50
For one - Because of the amount of coins then under their control and manipulation that would be possible with that
@_date: 2014-09-10 07:07:26
Isn't this just a less featured version of onename.io?
@_date: 2014-08-20 13:42:52
Have you? If you reported a financial issue to a bank that could cause somebody to take another's funds with steps to replicate the issue that were technically sound then there is not only no way it would take four months, but a senior or PR team member would have been assigned the job to control the communications risk. It's not very fair to compare the two as Bitcoin isn't matured to this point as yet, but Banks have very strict policies for these kinds of issues and a critical bug (once again, stating that this would have to have the potential for loss of funds) with the associated PR risk would never be allowed to reach this point.
@_date: 2014-08-20 06:26:33


Very true - I've chosen to take OP at his word here.
@_date: 2014-09-19 05:13:22
Or $3! @_date: 2014-08-20 05:37:32
No, unfortunately not. [Source](
Example 2: bitcoin provided in exchange for goods or services
12. Paul owns a computer shop and is registered for GST. He sells a server for a GST-inclusive price of $7,700 to Ross Co, a building company that is registered for GST. Paul agrees to accept bitcoin from Ross Co in exchange for the server.
13. When Paul lodges his business activity statement, he includes $7,700 for the taxable supply of the server to Ross Co and claims credits of $700 for the acquisition of the bitcoin. When Ross Co lodges its business activity statement, it includes $7,700 for the GST inclusive market value of the bitcoin, and claims credits of $700 for the acquisition of the server.
Example 3: merchant using an intermediary to accept bitcoin in exchange for goods or services
14. Following on from Example 2 above, Paul has an agreement with an intermediary acting as his agent to accept bitcoin in exchange for goods and services. When customers provide bitcoin to the intermediary in exchange for goods and services, Paul pays commission to the intermediary equal to 1% of the price. The intermediary agrees to deposit Australian currency (immediately or within one day) into Paul's nominated bank account. There is no agreement between the customer and the intermediary.
15. Two transactions occur here. First, the customer supplies bitcoin in exchange for the supply of goods and services from Paul as a barter transaction. The GST consequences of this are explained in Example 2. Second, Paul supplies bitcoin to the intermediary (through the transfer of bitcoin from the customer) for Australian currency which is treated as a taxable supply by Paul on which GST is payable. The intermediary provides Paul with taxable services for which the commission is consideration and the intermediary may claim credits for the acquisition of the bitcoin.

Most finance development teams work with SCRUM. If you're doing that and you're taking more then a sprint to fix a high priority bug then your velocities or capacities are completely wrong, you're under resourced, or your product is beyond hope. Regardless - going beyond a two week cycle for a high or critical bug is either a good indication of a very troubled business, or very poor internal practice. If it's not a high priority bug then this at minimum should have been the communication back to the user, but further I would expect some level of explanation back to what looks to be an informed user as to why so as to ease their mind and avoid the public backlash we're seeing here.
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:16:17
Agree, but that was in response to a user who I felt was implying that the process would be worse at a bank. Potentially I misunderstood the intent of his comment, but I think what I said was fair with that in mind.
@_date: 2014-08-20 08:46:38
I agree however I was posting this for the benefit of anybody who may wish to do so for a use case I don't have visibility on
@_date: 2014-08-20 06:17:40
I'm a financial services developer - if there is a bug that can lead to customers losing money which impacts your business with goodwill loss as well as having to reimburse your user base then the 122 day delay would very rarely apply. It  sounds like that's what we have here, which would classify it as a critical bug (a typical SLA would be &lt;8 hours for this). I'm more shocked that they didn't at least communicate with OP better though - if I couldn't resolve the issue in a timely manner I'd be scared about the bug becoming public knowledge and I'd do everything I could to prevent that, including keeping OP informed and in favor.

So easy to say after the fact...
@_date: 2014-08-20 05:21:49
It looks like yes, exchanges will need to charge GST for any Bitcoins sold in Australia however Australian exchanges will not need to be applied to sales for overseas buyers.
Edit: More information ([source](
Example 1: bitcoin exchange transactions
8. Liam carries on a business buying and selling bitcoin (BTC) as an exchange service online in Australia charging a 1% commission on the published exchange rate. Liam is registered for GST.
9. David, who is not registered for GST, uses Liam's online service to exchange 10 BTC to Australian dollars. The exchange rate at the time of the transaction is 1BTC = AUD662. The commission is $66.20. David receives AUD$6,553.80 for his 10 BTC.
10. The following day Karin, who is registered for GST, wishes to purchase 10 BTC from Liam's online service for use in acquiring an asset for her business. The exchange rate is 1BTC = AUD662. Karin acquires the 10 BTC for AUD$6,686.20 plus GST. The GST inclusive amount of AUD$7,354.40 is calculated as follows: 10 BTC x AUD$662, plus AUD$66.20 commission, plus AUD$668.62 GST.
11. Liam records this exchange transaction with Karin and includes the amount in his business activity statement. If Karin's acquisition is wholly for a creditable purpose, Karin may claim input tax credits for the GST she paid on the acquisition of the bitcoin. When Karin later acquires an asset in exchange for bitcoin, she will record the supply of bitcoin as a taxable supply and an equivalent credit may be claimed in respect of her asset acquisition.

If only this was true outside of software circles. I sell my woodworking online and I've been accepting Bitcoin since January - not a single order in Bitcoin. I think it's true if you're in a technical career path but isn't really true outside of it.
@_date: 2015-04-09 12:00:23
 - any thoughts on good ways to make it clearer that I take Bitcoin to appeal to the community better?
