Your UC wallet is stored on your computer, yes? So it can be hacked. Not so with OT.  
OT can do real-time instantaneous microtransactions for something like 1/1,000,000 of a penny, for almost nothing, drawing from bitcoins stored on servers that cannot steal your funds. How can you do this? 
You say "pure bitcoin" as if that's a selling point, but as I understand it there's nothing insecure about off-chain transactions within OT. It's all secure crypto.

One small problem. There is no such thing as satellites because the earth is not a sphere and the earth is not spinning. All communications are ground based. Einstein was wrong about "gravity" and Michelson, Morley and the great Nikola Tesla (how ironic) were right. The earth is surrounded by an aether, not satellites. The scientifically-minded bitcoin crowd should understand this better than anybody: skeptical people should claim to "know" only what can be confirmed by their senses. None of you have ever seen a satellite orbiting the earth but you all assume they exist. Simple spherical trigonometry proves explicitly that the earth cannot be a sphere.

Right now, Bitcoin can handle 7 transactions a second, but let's make that 1,000,000,000 transactions per second. And let's say that everybody uses a new address for every transaction. In this case, 31,557,600,000,000,000 (31 QUADRILLION) new addresses would be used every year. Now, we want the chances of generating a duplicate address to be very small. Let's assume the highest acceptable risk is  1/1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1 IN 1 SEPTILLION). With these parameters, it means that it will be another 4,631,219,222,408,874 years (4 QUADRILLION) before there is a danger of a collision.

The price. Bitcoin could easily double in a year and bring in more people than we think. I've been in bitcoin since early 2011 and have never felt more insecure about the Core team and it's not because of daily FUD from the banker paid shills that I'm convinced have infested all the forums. It's because Core clearly believes bitcoin has already won the crypto race. That is extremely foolish. They have opened attack vectors not having raised the block size two years ago. Now that fees are high miners are raking it in and are not incentivized to move to Segwit. So now we need a price crash to bring them over! This was totally predictable but was ignored. The issue is confidence in the development team from a user perspective and I fear they are losing it.

Off topic but let me ask you: Why can't core guarantee skeptics like Roger Ver that if fees go higher than x in say six month's time or whatever the code will trigger another increase? Is this not possible? After listening to Roger debate Johnny Dilley it seems to me the only real contention is the tx fees and that the skeptics think Segwit isn't enough to prevent more congestion before LN is implemented.

Sorry, but you're just repeating received opinion which is second-hand "knowledge."  Natural science is first-hand knowledge. Basic epistemology. You must demonstrate the superiority of the model *versus a competing model,* but we were never fairly presented with a competing model were we? Wonder why. 
Most people don't understand that Newton just made up the attributes of gravity to make the heliocentric model work. It has never been proven with observable and repeatable experiments *as distinct from* buoyancy and density. Newton claims to have invented the idea early in his life, but he knew that no mathematician of his day would approve his theory, so he invented a whole new branch of mathematics, called fluxions, just to “prove” his theory. This became calculus, a deeply flawed branch of mathematics having to do with so-called “infinitesimals” which have never been observed. Then when Einstein invented a new theory of gravity, he, too, used an obscure branch of mathematics called tensors. It seems that every time there is a theory of gravity, it is mixed up with “fringe” mathematics. Anything that can be manipulated cannot be trusted. And mathematics can be manipulated.﻿
Sounds a lot like u/nullc doesn't it? One bullshit ad hoc rescue after another.

Touché, so lemme just put it in a straight up modus ponens and avoid going down the rabbit hole too far given this is so off topic.   
Modus ponens: 
If p then q,
therefore q
1. If water always finds its level and the earth is covered in water, then the earth is level. 
2. Water *does* always find its level and the earth *is* covered in water. 
3. Therefore the earth is level.
If the premises are true the conclusion *must* be true. So which premise is false?  If I show you a picture of a beach ball covered in water does that invalidate the empirical evidence of repeatable experiments that infallibly show a volume of water without exception finding its own level and never, ever, adhering to the exterior of a shape, or settling convex or concave or on an incline?  Of course not. So why is the answer "yes" if the guy's wearing a bubble suit with a Nasa logo?

Do you think LN requires full blocks to work? I don’t understand why Core is so insistent on full blocks. If LN is useful people will use it whether blocks are full or empty.  Core seems to want to tax people to "incentivize" them to use Blockstream's product. Core (wrongly) predicted a “fee market” and a stable backlog of mempool transactions at full blocks so I’m wondering if they themselves think LN requires full blocks to work. Obviously the more people using LN the better it will work but if they think they can just basically tax on-chain users to get them to use their product they will and should fail. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:55:32

@_date: 2017-08-24 00:08:42
Your point is moot because Segwit alone isn't scaling anyway. And even if it were scaling you're point is moot because Core needs FULL blocks to transition to LN. That's what no one's talking about:  Maxwell's "fee market" is nowhere to be seen. Full blocks are too disruptive to on-chain use. It's that simple. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:12:27


Okay well the better part of seven years of bitcoin running fine with empty blocks and optional fees is empirical evidence (versus speculation and theory) that you are wrong about that. I have found a theme emerge that most Core supporters talk about what 'should be' and most empty blockers talk about what has actually happened in the real world. Just an observation. Seems obvious to me at least that regardless of why fees are going up the chain with the lower fees and faster times is going to win. What difference does it make if LN is the Holy Grail if users never get to use it because they *will not* transition through high on-chain fees and slow conf times? Based the presumption that they can just pick up the L1 users and place them into L2 unicorn land Core seems to have backed themselves into a corner where they need to destroy bitcoin in order save it.

LN will never work as a replacement for on-chain transactions because **working means adopted and therefore LN requires its own network effect.** Real-world L1 users must migrate to LN for it to function. How do you onboard new users to bitcoin if they'll need a couple hundred bucks to open/fund/close a lightning channel? Or when you can only send to people with funded channels? Or when they have to be online to receive funds? If on-chain fees become ~$20/tx to open/close a LN channel (which they will) a 2% transaction fee would require a $1,000 commitment. How is this a scaling solution for bitcoin?  Now I've got to ask my noob to pony up a thousand bucks so I can send him ten? Is that some kind of fucking joke? Considering the above it’s quite understandable why Core would be insistent on a blocksize cap to kickstart lightning’s network effect. But all they’ve accomplished is driving people to altcoins, which is what everyone predicted. Median fees are too high right now this second  Core have utterly failed at their assigned task to scale bitcoin.

Lightning requires its own network effect. You can’t just copy and paste L1 users to L2. Real-world L1 users must migrate to LN for it to function. How do you onboard new users if they'll need a couple hundred bucks to open/fund/close a lightning channel? Or when you can only send to people with funded channels? Or when they have to be online to receive funds? If on-chain fees become ~$20/tx to open/close a LN channel (which they will if blocks remain capped) a 2% transaction fee would require a $1,000 commitment. How is this a scaling solution for bitcoin?  Now I've got to ask my noob to pony up even a couple/five hundred bucks so I can send him five? Is that some kind of joke? Maybe actually learn about this stuff instead of parroting boilerplate talking points!

Because I'm too lazy to write my own response: 


BTW your own link cites Satoshi calling nodes MINERS. The only nodes that count are the mining nodes. All others are RELAY nodes, not "validation" nodes. Call them whatever you want, people will choose the most secure chain as defined by the most hashpower. The core chain will be unusable.

You can make up theoreticals all day long and say consensus is whatever you want but you're ignoring the enormous incentive for economic actors to stay on the same page and choose the safest, cheapest and fastest chain which will be the one with overwhelmingly the most hashpower. It will be incumbent on the miners to act in self-interest and incinerate the minority chain with that hashpower for breaking consensus. Core will fork into another POW and officially become an altcoin with it's own *highly centralized* (lol) hashpower.  Bitcoin is working as designed, like it or not.

Technonarcissist utopia. Call supply whatever you want, but when humans are no longer directly involved in farming it will be the useless humans who will be farmed. So-called fresh produce is already so overhybridized it is harmful to the human body as the sugars are barely recognizable by the pancreas and liver causing all sorts of problems. This is not "wealth." But we count it as "supply." Likewise lawyers.

Same conclusion I've come to. Only thing that makes sense in all of this chaos. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 05:44:07
Yes hybridized fructose is a different sugar. It will look like “fructose” under a microscope but not to the liver which will pass it on to the pancreas which then attaches insulin to metabolize it but usually ends up converted to fat. This overworks the pancreas, feeds candida and exacerbates other problems like diabetes. Heirloom fructose does not require insulin to be metabolized which is why a diabetic can fast on it. If you fast on hybridized you’ll end up like that actor who played Steve Jobs who wound up in the ER with elevated pancreas levels. Yes hybridization occurs in nature but SLOWLY and never for the reasons it is done today, like surviving the shipping, shelf life and aesthetics. All of it is harvested too early before the sugars mature so is no longer alkaline forming in the stomach. It’s all NPK fertilized. It’s a disaster. Grow your own heirloom fruit and you will not be sorry as this is just going to get worse.

Well, when (not if) you get sick some day perhaps you will look into this. Fructose from seeded heirloom fruit does not require insulin to be metabolized. It burns cleaner thatn glucose and goes straight to the cells to produce ATP. If a diabetic fasts on seeded heirloom watermelons he will have zero spike in blood sugar because the test measures insulin not sugar. But he will show a spike if he eats HYBRIDIZED, SEEDLESS watermelon because that sugar is recognized as strange by the liver and pancreas and will attach insulin to it. Here are the problems associated with hybridized fruits. This guy Mercola doesn't understand the difference but he is telling you the problems that result from typical store-bought hybridized fruit, and it's from a real MD so no tinfoil hat!

Ad hoc psychoanalysis: I've heard Gavin state about a dozen times in public that Satoshi left right after Gavin told him he would meet with the CIA. He even referenced it in his recent "Satoshi" post on his ninja blog. He wanted to know if it was true. He wanted *someone* to be Satoshi to clear it up for him, maybe to tell him it wasn't the reason he went underground. He wanted *someone* to be Satoshi to answer all of the questions he had for him. There must've been some motivating reason he abandoned all opsec. From where I sit Gavin is a very sincere guy. It's something along these lines.

Ten percent where'd you get that number? AntPool, bitcoin.com and nChain could make up ~25% of the network. More will follow. They will identify and ignore segwit transactions. Wallets that implement Segwit **WILL** be slower and more expensive. Bitcoin users will therefore choose wallets that ignore Segwit. This is the kind of competition we need in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:57:12

Not an altcoin. It's the same chain, different wallets in two camps: those that support Segwit and those that don't, it's that simple. The people will vote if Segwit is worth the risk. Not for me. I prefer bitcoin the way I've used it the last six years thank you very much. Now that Core will lose the reference client bitcoin will be in much safer hands.

Which is why BIP141 got so much support from miners! Oh, wait....
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:30:25
Miners have prevented Segwit alone because LN is a direct threat to their profits. The market will force Blockstream to come up with a version of LN that is not so disruptive to miners and users or they will and should go bankrupt (likely). 
We can argue theoreticals forever. It’s not about stealing money but blocking pathways. Testnet is not real money so we won’t know until it’s live. Here are some other problems.  


Remember the magic sauce of organic routing is the ability of wallets to open new channels on-the-fly when they can’t find a route. In our original example, Alice went to pay the coffee shop, couldn’t find a route, so her wallet just opened a new channel and kept it open.




Remember back to the original explanation of routing using hashed timelock contracts. Alice’s wallet contacted Bob’s wallet and asked for a hash of a random number (R). Well, Bob basically needs to be online to give that to her. **This is in direct contrast to Bitcoin as it is currently used where the sender and recipient don’t need to be online at the same time. Of course Bob could outsource this function to a third party (which is an ugly solution IMO), but this is just going to create even more pressure to just use a payment hub rather than organic routing.**
 
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:52:43
Untested in the real world is risky. Why should I use it if  I can get cheap and fast transactions without risk with a wallet on the same chain that doesn't support Segwit? What's the benefit?

Bitcoin will grow stronger with competing implementations, not weaker.

Consent much be reached at the core dev level working on the reference client or the fucking thing will fork, get it? This gives the core devs enormous influence. Thank god that fork is finally coming and when successful should and will humiliate the Blockstream/Core devs who’ve mounted a campaign of disinformation against hard forks. Then I can get back to using bitcoin like I have been for the last six years. In May I had a $350 transaction with a $7 fee sit in the mempool for 10 fucking days. When the market sees how Blockstream destroyed themselves by trying to shove a non-opt-in soft fork down the throats of users, more co-operation will result and bitcoin will be a protocol layer supporting several different implementations like TCP-IP supports competing web browsers. This is NOT the case today. 
Please listen to Jeff Garzik for an objective view of segwit :   
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:21:12
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:24:56
Ignore logic at your peril. Segwit capacity does not offer more room until full adoption therefore it will be the slower fork. So the +2x hard fork chain will be faster and have more hash power. Let us trade. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:36:44
But miners can still choose to ignore Segwit blocks. Clients can still choose to not support Segwit. So users and miners will decide whether Segwit is relevant on the network. This is the way it should be.

If Core decides to not merge the 2x part of Segwit2x they will be splitting off from 90% of hashpower. Do you honestly think businesses like Bitpay/Coinbase/Blockchain.info/Shapeshift or whales with 100s of millions are going to choose the chain with less security because they like the devs? The term 'bitcoin' will remain with the chain that everybody uses which will be the chain with the most hashpower because it has the most security. You should have both tokens so just hodl and you will be fine.

The point is that you are opening up attack vectors that do not now exist. You don’t really know whether pathways can and will be blocked until REAL money is at stake. It seems to me the # of potential hops in LN makes it very vulnerable. Not to mention the price of keeping a channel open. Until REAL money is at stake you simply have no idea whether hubs will centralize. 
And another question is: why should miners approve a path to LN when your fundamental business model is to take half their profits? The miners stand to gain much more scaling on chain than scaling with LN. To me LN seems incredibly disruptive to a system that has proven itself to work in the real world.

Ver's main point is that bitcoin's network effect is its most valuable asset and is being taken for granted by core delaying its growth. No one can argue they are not holding up bitcoin's growth. If a state/bank-sponsored actor takes a run a bitcoin and succeeds it will be entirely core's fault. Delaying bitcoin's growth has opportunity cost/risk that is not realized until it happens. They are squeezing bitcoin's first mover advantage for everything it's worth.
