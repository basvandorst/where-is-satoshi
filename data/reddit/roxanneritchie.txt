Let them mock you. That’s what I do.  When we go on vacations with the entire family and my spouse and kids are in the nice hotel, have the nice rental car and aren’t broke the entire trip, all I can do is smile. Meanwhile the rest are in a motel 6 or whatever the cheapest hotel was they can find, constantly complaining how broke they are because their flights were so expensive. 
As people educated in btc, as with many other things, it’s not our responsibility to educate everyone else.  Just do you thing, enjoy the ride and everyone else will catch up eventually (hopefully).  Btc has been good to me. Wish I had got in sooner for sure but I’m not complaining

Don’t worry, most of us have been there. After a while on the rollercoaster, dips like that one won’t even get much of your attention. At least that is my experience.

When I started I put $5 away and once I had about $50 I would buy. I’m better off financially now (due to my job, not btc) but I still save a $20 here and there and buy when I have $100 or so. Might not make sense to buy $5 worth at a time but it def makes sense to save it up until you can buy.
