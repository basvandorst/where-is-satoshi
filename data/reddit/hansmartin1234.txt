No :(
Copy and paste should work, right?

@_date: 2013-11-21 15:47:33
Yeah, but thank you very much!
I appreciate the time you've spent on it!
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:38:05
Yeah. I think i made a typo somewhere but not more than one. So... there are many many options out there
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:18:47
Ähm,  Don't you believe it's my wallet? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:06:14
I got a BTC and a LTC Wallet :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:09:56
i will definitely go there! thanks
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:16:20
Nope! :(

What do you mean with pass?
Edit: Passphrase?
I think one of my thoughts were druing typing that passphrase was: Good that the "22:00" is not part of it so i don't have to think about what to do with numbers.

i think the smiley explains itself 
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:28:43
No, i'm from Germany :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:36:06
Is it legit? Do i get my bitcoins back? Does anyone has experience with it?
but better than having nothing. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:05:55
i'm on it
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:05:47
No, i'm sure there are no full words in there
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:25:08
Yeah, i know it sound weird but somehow i had that thougt. Maybe because of the ":" ? Who knows, i don't unfortunately.

Assuming that i'm going to invest in Bitcoins and will hold them for at least 10 years. How do i hold them safely? In my wallet? What happens if my pc crashes? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:20:20
They can't do that with just the passphrase i think
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:04:03
So that no one can access my wallet, including myself :D .... :'(
