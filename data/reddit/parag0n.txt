Yes. The original paper was titled: 
Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System.
The value come from the fact that its a finite resource produced at a finite rate. Ideally that is suppposed to protect it from inflation and volatility because you cannot simply print or issue more BTC like governments do with fiat money. Every one using Bitcoin as a stock market kind of undermines that idea though.

Look at him, so smart and edgy! Sure correlation doesn't always equal causation (I assume that was your point), but the correlation between income inequality and recession has been well documented and studied.

My comment was not to suggest that Bitcoin comprises the entire economy. That's obviously not true and did not need to be stated. It was to show an example of what happens to AN economy when money is not spent.

This is really not the apples to apples comparison you're making it out to be. As popular as Bitcoin has become it still a fledgling economy and there are not very many ways to spend it. Right now the focus should be on facilitating wider adoption, holding on to it does not help this happen. Bitcoin was meant to be a currency, not an investment. You don't "invest in money" you "invest money".

You mean being a consumer, like the majority Westerners? That really has nothing to do with what currency you use.

Holding on to money and not spending it is not good for an economy. For example the two worst periods for income inequality on record for the United States were 1928 and 2008, just prior the the great depression and the great recession respectively. 
This is relevant because when money is concentrated in the hands of a few people it is ostensibly being hoarded and not being spent as it would if more people were keeping it in circulation. I'm not making any kind of political statement here I'm just illustrating what happens to an economy when money is not spent freely, it collapses. The same will happen to Bitcoin if everyone holds it, except there won't be a bailout. 
Edit: I'm being downvoted by people who obviously just say the word economy without thinking about what that entails. Yes savings is a part of it, but with no spending there is no economy, there's just a bunch of individuals holding onto something, in this case Bitcoin. You all are still looking at Bitcoin from the perspective of a way to invest your dollars, and not as a form of currency. If it doesn't eventually establish itself as the latter it will probably fizzle out at some point.

No I haven't contradicted myself at all, I just didn't think I needed to connect all the dots for you, but apparently I do...
The value of Bitcoin is SUPPOSED to come from the fact that the rate halves every 4 years and the overall number is capped at 21 million BTC. Unfortunately when people only trade it for USD and not for goods and services, its value becomes solely based on how much USD people are willing to pay for it. If the market wakes up tomorrow and decides that your Bitcoin is worth $0, then that's that. Because you can't purchase anything with it, all of that "value" you're holding onto becomes 0. If it was a widely circulated currency like the USD at the end of the day it would always have value because you could always go buy anything you want with it. 
"Store of value" is just another term for investment. You invest in stocks because you think the value could possibly go up. Obviously that is not always the case because the market is dependent on many different factors. It's even worse for Bitcoin because it's not even tied to a companies performance or profitability, without it going into circulation, Bitcoin is just ones and zeros on a networks with no metric for its value besides the fact that everyone agrees to keep trading money for it. Understand?

You still aren't quite getting my point. It's like you're stuck on the notion that Bitcoin will always have it's value defined in terms of USD. If you could buy cars and houses with Bitcoin then the ratio will be defined as the number of cars, houses, bags of chips, etc that you could buy with it, not the number of USD you can trade it for. 
Sure it would have a relative value in terms of USD but if it becomes just as ubiquitous as USD as well as being more valuable why not just spend Bitcoin instead of USD? That's like exchanging all your money to Yen before spending it. It would be pointless as you could just buy whatever it is with USD that are worth a lot more. 
It would make more sense to just get paid in Bitcoin, invest, Bitcoin, and save Bitcoin. Because if all else is equal as far as what you can buy and where you can spend it, then Bitcoin is (theoretically) a superior currency because of its built in inflation protection, anonymity, value, and convenience.

True. I'll concede that is a more accurate description of credit.
@_date: 2014-09-06 14:38:39
Credit is ostensibly just borrowing currency and paying back with interest. Credit card companies can adapt to lend Bitcoin just like USD or any other currency.

Ok then how much is a dollar worth? About 0.77 euro, 105 yen, 0.6 pounds etc. If all we ever do is trade one currency for another then these conversion factors are meaningless unless you just prefer to sit and look at dollar bills instead of yen for some reason. 
The real meaning and value of currencies only emerge when they are used to trade for something useful or desirable like clothes, food, cars, etc. Yes there is a metric that balances one currency against another, but the real measure of its value is how much stuff you can buy with it. That's what a price is. A price is not saying one dollar cost a dollar, or one pound costs 1.6 dollars. Its saying that TV cost $2000 or £1200
