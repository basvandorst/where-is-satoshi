Nope, you must enable live bitcoin transactions through your stripe account before the bitcoin:true flag has any effect. Nice thinking though.

Once again, I'm submitting an idea I've thought of - it might be stupid, I might have overlooked something but let me know what you think. 
The idea is a service would exist to allow a buyer to put BTC into a secure account - which would then perform transactions and hold funds on the receiving users account for up to three days. This would allow both parties to make a protest in the case of something going awry. 
The protest system would need to be unbiased of course, if you have a suggestion, let it be heard. I can imagine transactions having a number of different types, such as trade for physical goods, trade for digital service etc and based on this, the "revoke" power could lie with a different party .

The idea is mainly for original work, though maybe I haven't made that clear. Sort of like if you were playing on the street and somebody threw some money into a hat. 
If you feel like submitting though, feel free to do so.

Cool. Well, how about (and I'm making this public so if anybody want's to get involved they can have the same chance) we give it a week or so and if you're still interested I'll send you a mod invite then?
AS far as signing up bands without knowing it...I don't know how well that would work, from the tippers perspective. I would ask the bands first and say you'll do it on their behalf.

question, as somebody completely new to bitcoin, and the bot, how long does it typically take to verify and do a tip transaction?

Not a bad idea. But what if the people who made a lot of money on the "bubble" there, invested enough to set up a system similar to paypal that worked alongside bitcoin? A simple system that handles analogue currency like paypal but allows these kind of trades? 
There must be enough money owned by enough people who believe in bitcoin to make this work.

If you feel like giving back and growing your customer base has plenty of musicians trying to get started with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-17 11:24:21
Check out , plenty of musicians already happy to accept tips  using the bitcointip bot.
edit: Infact, at the moment, none of us have any bitcoins, so a few tips would go a long way in helping to community grow.

Care to divulge some more? I'm graduating this Summer from Comp Sci and I've an interest in web development. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:24:11
Cool, Thanks!

Hey, check our @_date: 2013-04-12 19:03:28
Awesome in-depth answer, thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-17 11:28:31
Oh OK you got me.
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:37:52
That was exactly my plan. I figured that getting it up and running with a subreddit would be the fastest route to market though.
I had the idea that maybe the bot rounded tips to the nearest US cent and kept the remainder, I don't think people would have a problem with this. 
Would you be interested in helping out?

Ok i, wont ask - but is it against the rules to post about @_date: 2013-04-13 12:20:36
@_date: 2013-04-21 00:12:50
If you suggest a suitable website, I'd be willing to give it a shot. suitable in this sense meaning with an API that allows bots to post from an account and get other info.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:15:14
You are assuming the entire market is as volatile as it has been in the last number of days. surely market volatility has an impact in every other currency too, so how do they get over the problem?
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:53:30
Cool. Best of luck with it. I don't have any BTC to donate, but if I did, I would.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:21:24
I disagree to be honest. Of course people have no obligation but surely enough people will be altruistic enough to give towards the greater good.
Secondly, I think you could be overlooking a great opportunity, there is obviously a demand to trade analogue for digital, as seen over the last few days. BTC trades could be the right device to piggy-back on.
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:38:52
Nice work. What API are you using to get your chart data?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:13:01
Yeah. I'm new to this, so it turns out this is exactly what I'm describing. Why don't they exist in the mainstream for BTC?
Could it be possible to make a distributed escrow service?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:13:43
No I have not but I will check it out! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:01:55
What about the idea in the other comment reply above?
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:45:54
Yeah, I didn't have time to do it yesterday, I suppose the example post should help get the idea across.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:15:50
I don't understand
@_date: 2013-04-20 00:31:55
I have some questions, if somebody does not mind answering:
Is there a limit to the amount of transactions in a block?
Can the same transaction be part of the merkel root of different blocks, with a different combination of other transactions?
Am I equally likely to find a solution hash by including more transactions as continuing with just one transaction?

Thanks! That's my bands new EP. I was actually going to put it up here to see if I could get some tips to pay for printing it.
