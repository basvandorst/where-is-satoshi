Yes. It can be done safely.
You need to just obtain 51% of the hash power and go offline with the public ledger and you can assure nobody else can make transactions as when you post your longer blockchain afterwards it will then happen retroactively and yours will win out thus assuring your transactions are posted first.

What?  You think you can just keep developing stuff until it defies reality?  That doesn't make any sense.
Do you think if we keep developing more efficient engines we will start producing energy as a perpetual motion machine? lol
@_date: 2019-10-27 20:04:40


It can be changed.  It's just code.

The US is in the most prosperous time it has ever been.
Police abuse is at it's lowest it's ever been in America.  You just didn't know about it before because you are ignorant and naive.

@_date: 2019-12-05 17:56:59
More importantly, it is if you want to learn about how it works.  So they just search how btc works.  This study is dumb.
@_date: 2019-12-16 03:57:54

By only mining when it's profitable.
It is that simple.
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:14:13


That has been the case since Satoshi made a 2nd address, approximately 6 days after the genesis block as the 2nd block was mined.
