The only control this central authority has is to regulate the issuance of coins and the refund of gold to/from nations and institutions that have actual gold reserves.  It would be the thing that ensures that the gold is real, accounted for, and not stolen.
You still get many of the goals of a the cryptocurrency movement: money that can't be manufactured, counterfeited, or devalued.  Wars on credit will end.  The would still have full anonymity their transactions, and no particular government could stop you from using them anymore than they can now, although they could choose to not honor their commitment to redeem you in gold for return for the coin.
What you don't get is the whole anarcho-utopia dream that seems the only thing backing bitcoin at this point, or instant wealth if you are already invested in bitcoins.
This is nothing like a gold etf.  This is a global gold based currency that has the advantages of crypto with none of the disadvantages of actual gold coins.

Yes pretty much the idea, except that you don't get your gold in the mail (unless you have to...).  The idea is you'd be able to use it like currency now for buying milk and paying rent, or cash it out in gold.

There are many kinds of banks, but mostly we don't like central (government) banks and large financial services companies.
The central banks are a problem because they print too much money, creating an intrinsic instability in our money system.

Inflation is a consequence of the technology and its application.  It is natural to assume a policy like this given the technology of money as it exists today.  If you can change the tech (that's blockchain), then the policy would also change to reflect that disruption.
Money is just a symbol of real value.  Our current money system has the flaw of being manipulated by counterfeiters and policies that create more money than the increases in real value.  This creates the inflation that we experience.  The money loses value with time and buys less things not because things became harder to make (in fact the opposite is true), but because there are more dollars chasing the goods relative to previous levels.

They could spend their own sovereign wealth (collected from taxes on transactions in the national currency, wherever in the world they happen), but they couldn't spend your own personal wealth, or the wealth of corporations using their coin.  Your own coins would be "paid for" from the national treasury when the coin is distributed as currency.  
The gold itself wont actually move except when nations decide they want it to, but the coin represents a certain amount of it.  This gold can exist in a bank vault or certifiable national repository like fort knox.  Upon certification, a global issuing authority (a UN like thing where nations are represented and actions are in the public eye and scrutiny) then issues coins to those institutions that have gold.  Those actors can then give those coins to the actual owners.  Those owners can then make sidechain currencies for their own national populations, or pay their employees with corporate (usually bank issued) sidechain coins (still backed by gold!), or purchase national sidechain coins from governments with actual gold they hold in their vaults.
It would be 100% premine coin to represent the total of all gold estimated to exist and all that we can reasonably mine in the next 200 years.  Design those coins in fixed amounts to owners of gold, with useful denominations for their intended purpose (large national transfer versus local denominations).
Of course a bad national could steal the gold they claim to have, so verification is necessary, and occasional international physical movement of gold will happen to mitigate risk.  But this is also the kind of thing that armies are there to protect against.  Any actor at that level that steals the gold doesn't deserve the protection of ... everyone else!

People understand bits on computers are memory.  People understand bits are also 12.5 cents.  They also understand that a Bit o Honey is a candy bar, and is not actually honey.
Nobody knows what a satoshi is because its a dude's name, and one who frankly wants to be left alone from what I've read.  It has no meaning outside of bitcoin to relate it to.
A cent is a shortening of some root that means 100.  It makes sense, it has proper context.  the denom name should mean something related to the unit size or the act of dividing.

Internet freedom isn't primarily economic in nature.  It is communication freedom.  It once was too expensive to communicate with people internationally, and difficult without special numbers that kept changing over time.

Blockchain tech will be adopted by big banks and world governments to handle inter-national transfer of wealth (which already happens largely in the vaults of banks in new York, London, Tokyo, etc.)  Sidechains will be adapted/adopted for national issuance of gold backed currencies, but international transfers of sidechain coins will be tightly regulated for purposes of taxation.

I agree with you in theory, but how do you respond to an argument I read a day or so ago, about the ability of a large organization (china was the example) to stage a 51% on bitcoin and destroy it overnight? 
This is what I was thinking about when I said, aha!  the people with money right now will need to start doing hashes.  e.g. all of the banks of the world will need to create hash farms.  We need them to have a vested interest in ensuring the immunity of the network from nuke from orbit.
How do we do that?   By getting the rich to buy into the currency with real gold.
Why gold?  Because its gold.  Everyone has agreed on gold for so long, I don't even question it.  Maybe its wrong but I just assume its right.
Edit: Why gold.  I actually have more strong feelings/reasons/research on this that I am letting on.  Gold works better than wampum and shells, which are more like fiat.  Gold works because it cant be grown in a lab, or at least not yet (economically).  There is a limited amount of it, that isn't changed much by mining anymore.  So it has that (reasonably) limited and authenticable quantity that you want in a symbolic store of value.  It also is desirable for aesthetics, which is a small, but not insignificant (socially) market.  There will always be a demand for gold as jewelry or decoration, not just now but 1000 years from now.  Also, smart rich investors always put some gold in their portfolio as a hedge, and governments and banks of the world already have vast reserves of it, and will expect that gold to have a fair value in any currency they are likely to support from a legislative point of view.

I think you are oversimplifying.  The blockchain is only an historical record, it isn't a useful thing in and of itself.  Without people processing transactions, those bitcoins are literally useless sequences of numbers, no better than dos 1.0 source code.
Any system of currency is one of trust.  Do you trust in dogecoin?  Or any of the other altcoins that have exactly the same mathematical properties as bitcoin?  Until you can control for those similarities, and explain why this crypto-coin is actually better, then you aren't really making a very strong statement about bitcoin, but rather all cryptocoins.
A currency is just a symbol.  If we used seashells, we would have a big problem of counterfeiting.  Gold has special properties that have been discussed time and again in history that make it especially useful as a symbol of wealth, but has some problems as a common token.
Cryptocoins solve the counterfeiting problem once and for all, while maintaining transactional anonymity and can be used for both common tokens and major financial transactions.

American Banks used to have very strict limits on what they could do.  They could hold your money, they could make loans, they could offer checking accounts.  Other sorts of financial activities, like speculating on the market, were separated from consumer debts, ensuring that risk in one sector would not spill into other sectors, creating cascade failures.  This system was abandoned about 20 years ago during a phase of deregulations in response to the savings and loan scandals of the 1980's.  This new system has created the giant banks like Bank of America and Chase, which have grown to proportions disallowed by law.  Then about 10 years ago, they used additional deregulations to allow the creation of a new type of security called the CDO, and allowed themselves into an ethical conflict of interest in which they both sold a product to investors on one side while actively betting against them in other markets.  This nearly bankrupted several European economies, notably Iceland.
Central banks print money to pay debts, stimulate the economy, and bail out these mega banks when their whole scheme failed.  Major insurance companies died (AIG), our securities rating services (Moody's etc) have come under harsh scrutiny for their role, and the whole system nearly collapsed near the end of Bush's second term.
Nobody has been punished, and the problem continues to grow.  These large banks have grown larger, they have not proved solvent, and the structural problem hasn't been addressed.  It is business as usual now, despite the obvious need for massive reform.

Well, verifying the physical gold is part of the processes, outside of the tech to implement the currency.  You would still need proof of work networks, presumably run by the banks and governments themselves since they are the ones with the most coin to protect, although it could be made public as well, and people and other corporations could start transaction processing farms and make coins on transaction fees.
But the ultimate store of value is the gold.  The coins becomes a fixed symbol of it, and the contract is that we can turn them in for actual gold if we want.  So like a gold coin store in America... I could go in spend the digitalcoin I got in Nigerian gold, pay the premium for a collector piece I like.  That gold store then deposits these Nigerian coins into their wallet.  At the end of the month, they go into the bank and convert all these crypto they got in payment into actual gold bars, because, they like gold bars, and take them home and bury them in their yard.  Now the bank consolidates all their Nigerian gold coins, and then transfers ownership of the actual gold Nigeria has in the bank in NYC to itself, and hands those cryptos back to global issuing authority, and gets clean crytpto coins back that they can re-issue.  At some point, the Nigerian account in NYC gets low, so we ask Nigeria to physically transfer some gold from their physical nation to NYC.  If they can't, then it could be that US stops accepting Nigerian bits.

The world keeps its gold reserves in banks and other secure places, and we can't use it as an actual coinage because it doesn't scale and has those problems of counterfeiting dilution and whatnot.
The world trusts the banks to hold that money, because that is their primary (original) purpose in the world and, armies.  I can't see that system every really changing.  It just isn't practical to move actual gold around unless absolutely necessary.
The bitcoin lets us do that virtually, to transfer ownership of actual gold from one actor to another, without it ever leaving the vault of a bank and without the bank's direct involvement in each transaction (except hashing generally).
The trust is in bitcoin protocol.  The banks can be regulated in such ways to ensure that you can redeem bitcoin for gold at your local branch, and the rate of bitcoin/gold will never change.
@_date: 2014-05-02 15:16:09

The centralization is necessary to allocate coins to actual gold owners in proper amounts.  Centralization doesn't mean secrets, this would be in the blockchain ledger and everyone could see it.  The nations of the world would be responsible for ensuring the trust of the central authority, in the way they do with banks and piles of gold now.  There is no other way to accomplish this.  But as far as transaction processing decentralization, that would be handled by any actor who has gold to protect, including banks around the world and individuals.
Premining is necessary because the point of the currency is to represent the fixed amount of earthly gold, not creating some virtual money space in the future.  The money supply would never grow except as transfers of gold from national/bank accounts to the central authority in exchange for the premined central coin.
As time goes on, our productive capacity as society woud increase, meaning that the value of the gold would increase to represent that.  A coin bought today represents a fixed amount of gold, therefore would go up in purchasing power with time.  You would make CD or savings account rates without a savings account.  Your money would be your investment in the future.  Goodbye inflation, hello deflation.

Since there is nothing to prevent the banks and governments of the world from creating their own bitcoin farms now, colluding on a sustained 51% attack to destroy the currency, what shall we do?
"They" already have the "power" and bitcoin can't really take it from them.  They can go nuclear.  We can't.  In addition, they can just outlaw it.  Sure it will survive in the blackmarket like drugs do, but it wont be the great thing it could have been.
You say "Only way to control financial system and assure its ethical and correct in processing is trough math and decentralization and away from powers that have brought us to the point where we are now. "  I think you are correct.  But the problem is the bad money system, not the actors (as human beings) themselves.  Each is acting according to various game theories that well predict nefarious behavior.  Wide adoption of bitcoin protocol makes that far more difficult.  Today, destroying the value of money its just a matter of turning on the printing press.   With wide adoption of bitcoin, that's impossible.
Just some thoughts, not sure if they are right.

Well, it goes way back to the arguments of Aristotle and JP Morgan.  
It can't be economically synthesized, is quite rare, (mostly) non-toxic, can be assayed/measured, is very hard to move in large quantities, it doesn't corrode, it is pretty and easy to use to make jewelry, ornaments, or electronics, and it is easily recognized by everyone from kings to paupers.  It's a cool metal.  So are all the others, but they aren't suitable for other reasons.  Silver is OK for similar reasons to gold, but it corrodes a bit and there is quite a bit more of it.  Other metals can be toxic or radioactive, or in such abundance that nobody wants it.  You can't responsibly go into the bank and ask for a pile of uranium.
But it fails as a common token because of counterfeiting and shaving and cutting it with silver, and tungsten, fucking tungsten.  The cypto version allows virtual gold that cant be counterfeited, can't be cut, cant be shaved, and can't be impersonated by tungsten.  You can focus your assays and weighing to the minimum necessary to support the health of system.
JP said that the only real money is gold.  I like the simplicity of that.

I prefer kilonanobitcoins (KnBTC) over "Bit" because it is easy to understand.  Then you can convert them in your head to microbitcoins (µBTC) anytime you want through the power of math.
It is completely logical and rational.

I am working on an idea because i'm bored.  This seems a good a place as any to post it for feedback.  If you enjoy this kind of thing, please criticize this idea, or if you have heard it before, any linkages would be greatly appreciated.
I just started thinking about bitcoin recently, so please don't hate if I'm late to the party here.
Seperating the Symbol from the Substance
The history of money shows us clearly what is wrong with our current system.  The cost of creating new money is too low for politicians to resist the temptation to fund current projects on the backs of the unborn.  This vicious cycle has an obvious end, when the currency is so worthless that it is abandoned.  This financial disaster awaits a future generation.  And we can now, finally, do something about it.
The solution is the bitcoin protocol.  But it is not, I will argue, in the "BitCoin" currency currently in use.  The primary problem with the current BitCoin currency is that the stakeholders in its success are not the presently wealthy people in society, but rather those early developers and adopters who mined piles of easy coins.  The enormous wealth transfer from people with fiat wealth to those with bitcoin will prevent any serious adoption of BitCoin.  The rich simply will not abandon the present system of fiat currency unless the new crypto currency starts out well planned to properly value real wealth in the world.
Therefore, no matter how broadly adopted BitCoin is becomming, it will ultimately fail.
So how do we rescue bitcoin the protocol, the ethos, and the promise?  
The answer is simple: we create a new cyptocurrency that is specifically designed to represent the real value of the world.  A cryptocurrency based on a real world reserve of actual wealth: Gold.
It would need to be controlled by the wealth holders of society and overseen by the governments of the world.  In this context, bitcoin the protocol is a platform for them to prevent any attempts by anyone else at gaming the system.  Bitcoin the protocol becomes a tool the wealthy can use to ensure that their wealth is... protected!
And the best part of all this is simple: the ethical goals of bitcoin are entirely preserved!  We still get limited currency and a destruction of fiat currency and our global financial system will become so much more efficient.
At first there were gold coins.  This was a problem because one couldn't easily tell if it had been alloyed or shaved or etched down in some way.  So in the USA, we seperated the substance from the symbol, and used paper money backed by a reserve.  This system worked financially.  But politically, when the war bill came due, that system was abandoned our government began printing money to pay its bills.
Returning to the gold standard is now possible with the invention of cryptocurrency.  Banks can be issued coins from a central global mining authority to represent their actual reserves of gold.  The cryptocurrency can be controlled early so that the cost of mining new coins is cost prohibative, if not entirely impossible.

I will hasten to add that I will be very confused when someone doesn't mean 12.5 cents when they refer to bits.
2 bits, 4 bits, 6 bits, a dollar!
OH FUCK.

You're not a General in this scenario.  You aren't deciding the validity of the transaction.
This problem you describe is a different sort, one of a stolen identity.  It is roughly equivalent to someone stealing your RL wallet.  No money system can ultimately solve the problem of your physical security.

The "backing" is a matter of trust in the system as a whole, not just the technology that enables it.

After WWII the nations of the world (except a few, like USA) were bankrupt and destroyed.  In the aftermath, the world agreed to a new system in which the USD would be backed by gold, but other national currencies would not be (they had no gold to back it!), but those other national currencies would be pegged to a fixed conversion rate to the USD that could only be changed by IMF voting.
The problem came when gold prices in the consumer market went up above the conversion rates of those foreign fiat currencies.  So what France started to do was print its Francs, buy USD from other nations, trade it in for Gold from the USA, then sell the gold for its Franks.  Wash, rinse, repeat.
That forced the USA to abandon the Gold Standard system, since France was straight up robbing the US treasury with their fiat currency games.
Now we just back the value of the dollar with a promise.  It isn't much, but it stopped the outflow of the real money (gold) from our central bank.

There will only be 21 million bitcoins ever.  If one were to create a denomination of sub-bitcoin that could represent the order of magnitude difference between 1 US cent and the total global wealth estimate (~300 Trillion USD in 2018), this would require splitting each bitcoin into 10 billion subunits, I think.

How are you going to buy a cup of coffee on the street with bitcoin if you have no physical thing representing, and transacting, the keys you memorized as you walked across the border?
You do you have a physical requirement of some way of interacting with the network to use the address.  Others will want to use plastic.
