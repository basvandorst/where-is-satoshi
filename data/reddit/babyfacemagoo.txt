No, under a liquidation suit in the eyes of the law they are an asset held by Tiabanne, and you will not be getting them back I'm afraid.
Assets must be sold to cover the fiat debts, and Tiabanne / MtGox has considerable fiat debts.

Not necessarily, all it shows is that someone edited the HTML and added a comment to *suggest* it has been.
It could be as simple as a "management buy-out" Where kerpopples agrees to "sell" the company to the employees for a nominal fee of $1 or so.
Or it could be that a few interested parties with a lot of coins at stake have come together and initiated a deal whereby kornpops gets to walk away.
Who knows.
At any rate I don't think it will be an "acquisition" in the traditional sense. Very interested to see what goes up on the site, if anything.

Eh? Who drops $250 million on John Carter when getting your money back relies entirely on 25 million people paying $10 a ticket from the get go... ? Oh yeah, that's right, Disney do.
Producing this type of blockbuster entertainment is a high-risk, high reward business. Who knew if Netflix's big risk with paying $60m for a season of House of Cards would pay off? But they went ahead and did it anyway.
I won't support the "tough shit" business model. It's from the 80s, it's out of date, and quite frankly it stinks. As long as there is an option for me to avoid it, legal or not, I will. 
Bleating about how these poor unfortunate multi-billion-dollar companies might lose a few million here and there if they didn't have the fallback of guaranteed TV subscriptions and DVD sales hardly endears me to you, or their cause. Time Warner could lose $500 million tomorrow, and I still wouldn't care.
I have no interest in supporting them, and if they made some bad TV show that cost $60m and nobody wanted to pay for, then boo-hoo for them, but I just don't care.

Lol. You can't deposit a Bitcoin. It never leaves the Blockchain. So this line is invalid.


This is what you lost if MtGox decided to spend your Bitcoins


They never breached their terms, since there was no clause in their terms forbidding them from using your coins for whatever they want, only that they would keep a record of how many you "had" in your account.
E.G. I have $0, You give me $100, I write on your "account" that you have $100. I spend $60 at Starbucks, your account still says $100, but I only have $40.
Now in the real world, an "account" that says $100 is legally worth $100. You can sue me to get the full $100 back if I only have $40 to give you, and I can be made to pay it. But an "account" that says 100 bitcoins has no such legal standing, since a Bitcoin is not a legally recognised financial instrument.
He can write "we will hold your bitcoins in your account", but that doesn't actually *mean* anything, since Bitcoins can't even *be* in an account anyway, they can only exist in Bitcoin wallets, and even then it's just an abstract representation of your power on the Blockchain. Your MtGox "account" is just an internal ledger for the website to keep track of how much they owe you.

It is absolutely still safe to use, normal users have no issues whatsoever and there is no way anyone can hack coins out of your wallet without gaining complete control over your computer and sending themselves the coins.
This "hack" came about because gox were sending out people's coins, then using automated systems to "verify" that the transaction was successful.
To verify a transaction is completed, a normal user simply looks at their own wallet software and waits for the confirms to show up, or looks on something like blockchain.info to confirm that the transaction was successful.
If I sent you 50BTC to buy something, then you said you never got the coins, it's pretty trivial for me to prove that you did.
What gox were doing was pretty nuts, they were sending out people's withdraws, then looking for the transaction ID to show up on the blockchain. If the transaction ID was rejected, it would never appear on the chain. In that case they would *automatically* re-send the coins, creating a new transaction.
What the hackers figured out was that you can cause a Bitcoin transaction to change its transaction ID, simply by messing with it a tiny amount (in this case adding some leading zeroes to the amount, so 0.2BTC becomes 0000.2BTC, still the same amount but just different enough to alter the transaction ID). 
Still with me so far?
The hack was basically to request a withdraw, listen for the withdraw transaction coming out of gox, change it very slightly then rebroadcast it to the bitcoin network. If the hacker's system was fast enough, and rebroadcast the modified transactions to enough miners quickly enough, it would actually supercede the gox transaction, meaning the gox transaction would never be confirmed, but the hacker's one was.
Then, gox would notice that the transaction ID it created was never confirmed, and automatically send the coins again.
It relied on a few fundamental weaknesses from gox:
- That they would not manually check a transaction failure before reissuing it
- That their automated system relied only on the transaction ID and didn't perform any other secondary checks (eg did that address that I sent those coins to actually get them, were they from me?)
- That the peers Gox was connecting to are slower and fewer than the peers that the attacker was connecting to.
There is of course nothing to stop anyone performing this attack on any implementation of BTC, however the protections against it are really very trivial.
If someone claims not to have received coins you sent them, simply hop on blockchain.info and input the wallet address you sent to. If you can see they did actually get them, they're lying. If you can see that the transaction ID they received the coins under is different to the one you sent them under, then it's likely they are attempting a malleability attack.
Besides which, steps have already been taken by the big mining pools to prevent this stuff from working in the first place.

You're misunderstanding the situation. The DoS started in response to MtGox assfuckery, the DoS could have happened at any time since the vulnerability was discovered in 2011, regardless of whether MtGox decided to draw attention to it or not.
Gox didn't "save" us from this DoS, they in fact caused it. I would not be surprised if the DoS actually originates from a Gox supporter, to try and save face from this utter shambles.
And besides, all the attacker is doing is slowing the network, not disabling it, it's actually a failed DoS.

Not really, all the network needs to do on receipt of bitcoin is prioritise the packets of a given user, it doesn't have to deliver any specific bandwidth or actually improve connection speeds, just attempt to. It's trivial to prove that you've delivered higher priority packets.
As long as people understand that they are paying to support the network and *hopefully* get better connection speeds, then there's no issue there.
The improved network speeds will be as a result of more nodes and exit nodes being created, not as a result of existing nodes increasing their bandwidth.

I believe they also pay Greg Maxwell, who also works for Coinbase and Jeff Garzik, who also works for BitPay, although it's not entirely clear.
With it being a decentralised, open-source project which the founder has mysteriously vanished from, it's not exactly a "normal" job to work on the client / protocol.
But the Foundation is not Bitcoin, it is only a non-profit intended to further Bitcoin as a technology. The foundation could dissolve tommorrow and work would continue on Bitcoin.
Anyone can volunteer their time to the github project, and any company who stands to benefit from stable and working bitcoin features and software can pay for a developer to work on it full time if they want, nobody can stop them, and nobody can force them.
The foundation are helpful, and their existence is a positive thing for Bitcoin, but nobody is beholden to what Gavin or any of them says. it's *our* technology, and we can choose to ignore them if we like, or we can choose to push our own code to the project which totally contradicts what they want.

His mistake is to assume that anonymity is a Libertarian ideal. It isn't.
It's true that most libertarians do hold anonymity dear, but that's not because they're a Libertarian. It's because the current system of oppressive, corporate, data-hungry government makes anonymity a necessary factor in staying free and unimpeded by the state / corporations.
With a truly liberal and liberated government, anonymity is far less necessary. If it doesn't matter if people know who you are and what you're doing, if there's no threat or consequence of being found out for tax evasion, drug dealing, money laundering etc. If the government and law enforcement are no longer this sprawling, bureaucratic mess of interconnected agencies and corporations spread across the globe, then the government, or anyone, knowing where your Bitcoins came from is much less of an issue. 
tl;dr: If we had a government close to the Libertarian ideal, it wouldn't matter if someone knew where your money came from or where you were choosing to spend it, therefore it would not matter that Bitcoins are fully traceable.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:59:36
I don't think it is actually. Something like Mycelium which tracks transaction propagation would easily detect your attempted fake spend.
Obviously if you just accept any string of characters as a valid bitcoin transaction with no checking whatsoever, then you'd be vulnerable, but even a zero-confirmation spend can be pretty confident within a few seconds with some fairly simple methodology.
In order to trick something like Mycelium you'd need a large network of fake bitcoin nodes, and you'd need the person you were scamming to be connected to those nodes, and you'd need them to be set up to respond to your fake transaction at the correct moment. You can't do it with just a cellphone. This seems a lot more difficult than forging money. (albeit a lot less illegal)

Well shucks, Hi Greg :)
I think you do great work, and it's unfair to have the blame laid at your feet for an issue that - as Mark even admits himself in his Forbes interview - could have been avoided completely if they just spent more time developing their wallet software.
I can understand the press release seeking to shift blame. I guess they had to say *something* to let people know why their Bitcoins were being held hostage, and telling the whole truth, that:
*"Sorry guys, we've not kept our custom wallet software up to date with the changes in 0.8, and as a result we've been losing a lot of Bitcoins to fraud recently"*
Would not have gone over very well. Not that what they did say is very much better, but I can see their intentions were to try and play the innocent victim of bad software.
At this point though it seems like we're dangerously close to a battle of egos, you vs. Mark, and Luke-Jr doing what he always does on the sidelines, stirring the pot for no reason.
Mark is clearly the antagonist, as we can all see, and you are just defending your corner.
Adding a non-mutable "MtGoxID" to every transaction seems like a fudge to me, it adds bytes to every transaction and, worse than that, it makes it seem like MtGox are calling the shots as to what changes are made to BTC. 
I'd much rather see the process which verifies the standard txid tightened up to reject mutated transactions. I'm aware that would require a significant change and possibly even a blockchain fork, but I think at this point it's worth it, and you would have very little difficulty convincing the network to accept the change.
Again, this adds credibility to MtGox's claim that bitcoin was at fault, not them, but I think most people will see through that pretty quickly. And once they re-enable withdraws, MtGox will not be an issue anyway, nobody will be touching them again.

Obviously some regulation is necessary, but i re-iterate my point, which is verifiable and demonstrable. Increasing the amount of regulation leads to higher numbers of people willing to ignore it entirely. The severity of the punishment for disobeying regulations appears to have no effect on that fact.
There is a 'sweet spot' whereby it is illegal to commit certain acts and this offers a minimum level of consumer protection. this is desirable. Preventing 'money laundering', as you call it, is overstepping this mark considerably.
One should ask what exactly is money laundering, and why should we care about it? if people have willingly spent money to buy drugs, and the retailer of those drugs wishes to spend that money, what business is it of the bank, or anyone for that matter, to stop them?

Right, because most judges recognise house painting as a common activity, they understand that someone deserves to be paid for that work, and there is precedent in contract law and so on to allow them to make that judgement.
Most judges *don't* understand crypytocurrency, and there is no precedent set in law for private and public keys stored in an anonymous, decentralised, open-source cryptographic blockchain.
You can't say "this guy stole my bitcoins", because you never had anything to begin with. All you really had was some passwords to allow you to make changes to a bit of software. To make matters (legally) worse, nobody *owns* that software, even the original creator of it has vanished. There is no legal owner of it, so there is nobody to sue.
If someone steals your Bitcoins you still have the private keys, they just don't do anything. You haven't really lost anything, especially Bitcoins you stored on Gox, since you never even had the private keys for those in the first place! 
When you sent coins to Gox, what you effectively did was destroy your private keys, which did have value, in exchange for a number on Gox's ledger, which had no value, but which they promised to honor. There's no law forcing them to keep that promise, and they had zero liability if they broke it. It was a pure trust system with the odds stacked heavily in their favour, and they broke your trust. You lose. You get zero.
Now there is precedent for "improper access to systems", "unauthorised distribution of passwords", "unauthorised access of private data" and so on, but it's all fairly shaky and cases involving those subjects tend not to be resolved very well, judges often don't understand the implications and full details of these cases, and often times it's impossible to even really know the truth.
Without any proper legal framework or even a legal definition of what a Bitcoin even *is*, any legal challenges to do with Bitcoin "ownership" will fail. We can't even really define what "ownership" of a Bitcoin is.

I'm not sure if you've been reading the coverage of MtGox over the past few months, but there have been literally hundreds of articles about MtGox on the front page, with hundreds of thousands of comments. There have been dozens of pages-long blog posts and news articles from respected bitcoin advocates and news sites.
You reduce all those millions of lines of text that have been written and commented about MtGox to *'They knew the risks, greedy people'*
That's some serious reductionism going on right there. And I'm not sure you even got it right.
But yes, one of the underlying sentiments *is* that people *did* know the risks. Of course they did. You can't not have.
Every day since April 2013 there have been numerous threads about MtGox, warnings, scam stories, speculation about their solvency, accusations of malpractice, etc. People ignored all of that to get a 20% higher price for their coins compared to BTC-E or Stamp. It's pretty much their own fault for ignoring the obvious.
The only reason people kept money on gox was greed, hoping to day-trade, make arbitrage gains or take advantage of the artificially higher prices there. We have very little sympathy for such people in this community, it's true.

No, what this "mafia" is doing *is* legal, because the laws of the land clearly state that they are supposed to be doing it. That is what "legal" means.
To pretend that these laws are false, and to imply that you can simply make up your own laws and claim that a completely legal act is a crime and describe it as a crime when it is actually provisioned specifically by law is actually asinine.
It makes you sound insane, and it damages whatever argument you are attempting to make.
Now if you want to say that taxation is *tantamount* to extortion, go right ahead. 
You'll still sound like a fucking idiot, because the vast majority of people actually do want to live in a society where we pay taxes, in order to pay for things we want and need in our society, like water, power, sewers and infrastructure. But at least you won't sound like a raving lunatic who has no grasp of reality.

You obviously have never actually run a business using Paypal. If you had, you would know that Paypal not only charges you ~3.5%, but it also issues chargebacks.
All someone has to do to raise a chargeback against you with Paypal is tell Paypal their account was "hacked". Paypal will then open a "Case" against you, and prevent you from doing any further business until the case is "Resolved". Invariably this means you issuing a refund to the person claiming to be "hacked".
It's much the same with Visa, Amex and Mastercard, only with more paperwork and letters (For which they charge you $25 per letter). in the case of Payment cards, it's more likely to be a criminal using a payment card they stole, rather than some snotty kid making up bullshit to Paypal, but the end result to the merchant is the same, they have to issue a refund.
Now, depending on what you're selling, these fraudulent chargebacks might account for as little as 2% or as much as 10% of your overall revenue.
This is a *significant* cost for doing business with cards or Paypal, and must be factored into your profit margin if you want to actually make money from your business. The only way to factor it in is to increase your margin, which 99% of the time means increasing prices to the customer.

Well actually it *is* against Chase's best interest to do that, and people *will* simply switch banks.
However what Chase are betting on is that enough people won't care enough to switch, for them to make money in the short term.
There isn't just one "best interest", there is a short term interest, a medium term interest, and a long term interest.
Losing customers is clearly not in Chase's long-term best interests, but we find, these days, that corporations very seldom care about long-term.
CEOs have a limited tenure, employees work for a few years then move, or stay in one job and then get promoted or shipped out somewhere else. Nobody looks beyond 3-4 years at a big corporation, which is why they will quite happily cannibalize long-term profit for more profit today.
Chase are also probably counting on other big banks doing the same thing, so that there is nowhere else for their customers to go.
Finally, most of their customers will be in Debt, not credit. So they aren't allowed to switch banks.

If nothing happens to Mark, who has misappropriated and "lost" over 600k bitcoins, and nothing is done to enforce him giving back the 200k that he even admitted to having, then really nothing will ever happen to anyone involved in any kind of Bitcoin fraud or theft, anonymous or not.

That's more to do with the fact that the network is being attacked, rather than "problems" in the client.
The client still works perfectly well, but due to the attacks on the network, you sometimes see duplicate transactions for a short while, until 6 confirms have been accepted. The client represents this correctly.

Ebay faces a lot of competiton now. It has managed to defeat it thus far by staying one step ahead. Integrating Bitcoin before anyone else would be another example of that.

Because the companies have to charge you 5-10% MORE in order to accept credit / debit cards, as well as any fees they might tack on at the checkout.
It costs a lot to be able to accept payment cards, and that cost is *always* passed on to the consumer. It costs very little to accept Bitcoin, and the fraud risk is near-zero.
This is why most places that accept Bitcoin offer a discount for using it, it's much cheaper and less risky for them to accept it.

Any random individual can still run a node.
I downloaded about 50TB last year on my home internet connection, mostly streaming HD video, so very little of it was saved. Less than 1% of that was related to Bitcoin in some way.
My internet connection costs me about $50 per month, and the hard drives in my NAS cost about $200 I guess.
It's still very much possible for the average, everyday person to run a full node.
You could run one on a raspberry Pi with a 64GB SD card for less than $100. Bandwidth is not an issue unless you're on dialup or some third world country that imposes traffic caps.

To me this is handled by the selling platform. So in the case of ebay, ebay would take your coins into escrow, and would only release them once the buyer pressed the "finalize" button and agreed the transaction was successful. Much like how SilkRoad worked.
People who received broken TVs could raise the issue with ebay support, who could simply take the funds out of escrow and give them back to the buyer.
No need for Paypal in this scenario (although yes I do realise that ebay and paypal are pretty much the same company now).
I guess Paypal could act as an escrow service for other websites.. So you go to cheaptvs.com, and alongside being able to pay with bitcoin, you can pay with Paypal, and paypal will offer an external escrow / resolution service. Seems like it would be very prone to fraud and deception though.

Agreed, but if I took a *copy* of a car from a dealership without actually setting foot in there, I just digitally downloaded it into my home computer, printed it out and started driving it around, they could not really justify the violence.
Stealing is stealing. Piracy is making an unauthorised copy. Please learn the difference. 
You have no right to prevent me watching a copy of your video that I made using my own computer, my own internet connection and is being displayed on my own TV. If you failed to secure your intellectual property such that people were able to make copies of it without your permission, that's your problem, not mine. Once the initial copy has been made, it belongs to the world.


Not watching, perhaps, but certainly listening:
In September 2012 the RIAA started to sue a whole bunch of people simply for downloading some songs. It generated so much incredibly bad publicity for them that they didn't try it again, but it certainly shows the intent is there.

Why does it? Out of all the issues I've heard everyday users having with Bitcoin, this one is one of the least impactful and easiest to live with.
It's like when email first started to get popular, average schmucks could not figure out what an @ symbol was, or where to put the dots. After a few years of getting used to it, nobody has an issue with email addresses.
A Bitcoin address is arguably simpler than an email address, it just looks weird if you've not seen one before. There's no dots, no dashes, no hyphens or symbols, just a string of letters and numbers. Once you have copied a Bitcoin address to your clipboard, it's very difficult to get it wrong when you paste it in.

Then his work was never worth anything to begin with.
If replicators like that existed, then indeed the premium that people would be able to charge for hand-crafted furniture would disappear, because there would be no advantage to having an "original" compared to a replicated copy.
Now, you appear to be assuming that all the "money, effort and skill" that goes into creating something like a movie is *absolutely worth it*, and the people who made the movie *deserve* to make 10, 20, 100 times their initial investment back.
I don't share your view. I think if someone wants to spend $6 million making an episode of Game of Thrones then let them, who am I to dictate how they spend their money? If they want to charge people to watch it and own copies of it, let them, who am I to tell what do do with the work they've created.
But when it comes to the idea that *my* copies of that work are also their *property*, that is where I disagree. I made the copy, not them. I connected to the internet and told my computer to start creating it. My internet, my computer, my power, my hard drive, *my copy*.
Your guy with the replicator owns the copies, not the creator of the chair, and they are worth whatever people decide they are worth, not some arbitrary figure intended to "recoup the losses" of the initial production plus many times more in profits.
If there's no money in making chairs any more, then the chair maker can't sue people for not buying his chairs.

That's not to say that Hitler was enlightened or reasonable, far from it, he was a murderous tyrant. The point was only to show that Jews have always had enemies throughout history, but ultimately the thing that will kill them as a *concept*, completely *eradicate* them, if you will, will be an enemy from within, not from without. The idea of The Jew will be destroyed entirely by enlightenment from religion and the furtherance of reasoned thought. Eventually, all Jews will have diluted into the global population and simply become part of one of the nebulous concepts of "American", "European", or "Russian".

It's not clear in the slightest. I don't really see how you can draw this conclusion.
Some newspaper in China simply re-hashed the 5th Dec statement from PBOC and said "wooooh you guys, you had better stop accepting prepaid Visa before the 15th, otherwise you're in biiiiig trouble!"
A load of people bought into it and thought it was true, so the BTC price started to fall... 
This has then spooked the card vendors in China, who are already on pretty thin ice with the PBOC anyway, since Chinese use these cards to bypass capital controls and import stuff, which China HATES (Imports bad, exports good, Mao taught them that).
So they don't take much spooking, and they've been spooked enough to stop their relationship with OKCoin and Huobi. BTCCHina didn't accept prepaid cards to begin with I don't think, so they're unaffected.
Nobody knows where the date of the 15th came from, nobody's been able to confirm it, the only source is this one news article. Classic scare tactics and misinformation.

Faster Payments doesn't actually make a payment. The banks simply agree to front their customers the cash while they wait for the actual payments to clear. You could do the same with Bitcoin by accepting 0 confirmation transactions, but you might as well just wait the hour or so for the confirmations.
SEPA might let you transfer money overseas relatively quickly, but it's significantly more expensive than Bitcoin. You get fucked with a transfer fee, a conversion fee, commission and they even fuck you on the forex spread too. Bitcoin is infinitely superior for moving money between currencies and countries, both in terms of transaction times and cost to transact.

You're almost there, but not quite.
If a miner costs $10'000 for 50Ghash @ 1200W
then 2 years later a miner costs $20'000 for 500ghash @ 600W, but the difficulty is 10 times higher and the price is 4 times higher
Then the cost per Ghash has decreased, the Watts per ghash has masively decreased, the hashrate on the network has increased by 10 times, the profitability of mining has roughly doubled, but the overall energy usage of mining has halved.

The films made with multi-million dollar budgets tend to be the worst ones.
I personally would not give a single shit if they stopped making those.
Reservoir Dogs cost $1.5 million to make in 1992. Adjusting for inflation, that's $2.4 million 2013 dollars.
Zach Braff's Kickstarter Campaign raised $3.1 million in crowdfunding in 2013, and resulted in a really charming movie which ended up making a lot of money in international distribution rights and so on.
I really don't see that anything of value would be lost by the big movie studios going under and no more $300 million shitfests like Pirates of the Carribean 3 or The Avengers: Assemble being made.

The retailer would be the cash machine operator in Spain. That's who would have ended up paying, not the bank.
"Consumer protections" are hardly a reason to carry on using USD. If anything, the fact that the bank can arbitrarily remove funds from merchants forces them to operate with higher profit margins and extend larger lines of credit to cover themselves from these losses.
We all end up paying for "Consumer protections" through credit / debit card surcharges and higher prices of goods, even if we have never been stupid enough to give our card details to a fraudster.
I would prefer to see people who are unable to secure their private keys take the hit from fraud and theft, not the merchants. Do you expect your jeans manufacturer to take the hit if someone steals a $20 bill out of your jeans pocket? Of course not.
Of course a proven track record means nothing. On what planet have you been living in the last 15 years? Do you remember 2008? A whole bunch of institutions with proven track records were shown to be nothing more than scamming, gambling, swindling crooks. If you think a bank or a stock broker or a hedge fund or a corporation is somehow trustworthy by virtue of the fact that A: they have a lot of money and B: they've always appeared to be trustworthy up to now, then you're a fool.
The world's economy is *always* teetering on the brink of collapse. That's how modern fiat economies work.

You're wrong, and you're making the same assumption that people like the RIAA and MPAA make when calculating their "money lost to piracy" bullshit figures.
There's no way on earth I would pay $80 for the box set of Game of thrones, even if that was the only way to get it, the internet didn't exist and there was no such thing as a pirate copy.
What most likely would happen is that I would either borrow it from a friend, or a bunch of us would club together $10 or so each and share a single copy, or I simply would not watch it at all until it came out on non-subscription TV.
A pirate download is *not* a lost sale. If I bought every movie and TV show and Game that I pirated over the last year, it would run to tens of thousands of dollars, much more than I make in a year. I pirate because it's there for free, not because I would otherwise be buying it for full price.
I don't *owe* the people who make the videos I watch or the games that I play *anything*. They chose to spend money making it, I didn't force them to. 
It's not like I signed up for a pre-order, promised to pay them when it was finished, then withdrew my order at the last minute. They never would have had my money in the first place, they lose nothing.
Tonnes of people pirating your product simply means you have a good product. These days, the positive word of mouth from piracy is worth way more than it costs in lost sales.
Beatport are expensive because they are selling music for DJs / enthusiasts, not because they can't make money selling to the general public like iTunes. One record will be played out to hundreds maybe thousands of people in the clubs, so they need to front-load the cost to the DJ. It used to be that you got these records on vinyl only, no CDs, from specialist shops and they would charge hundreds for a single, but the understanding was that they were selling to the trade, so it justified the high cost.

However, I do expect my decision to support EZTV, a group of people who share similar views about copyright to mine, to help in some small way. I know they don't make a lot, so anything I give them helps.

Not really no, all you can tell is which Bitcoin addresses they were sent to. You can't necessarily tell who owns those Bitcoin addresses.
If the stolen Bitcoins were subsequently moved to an exchange, *and* you were able to identify which exchange it was based on the wallet address, *and* that exchange co-operated with the investigation, *and* the exchange was able to identify the account used, *and* the person whose account it was used genuine details and not some anonymous alias, then you'd have a *chance* of knowing who it was that stole the coins.
But that's a lot of ifs.
If the person who stole them subsequently moved them to Silkroad and withdrew them again a few days later, there would be zero chance of knowing where they ended up.

Irrelevant to the point I was making. The point is they do not have the required regulatory permissions from their bank to accept customer deposits and withdrawals in the way they are. Their bank is taking a risk in allowing it, because no doubt they will make a shit-ton of money from Kraken.
However, eventually the bank will be unable to resist the pressure from the Fed and will be forced to terminate their agreement, which may include freezing that account. This has happened with every Bitcoin exchange so far that has taken deposits directly from US customers without getting the required permissions, including Gox. 
This isn't a dig at Kraken per se, every exchange that offers direct bank wire deposit is in the same position. It's not clear that it's even legally possible to set up a Bitcoin exchange with all the required regulation, since no exchange has actually managed to do it as yet.
Whether or not they are a willfully fractional reserve is irrelevant. If all of a sudden they cannot access a significant chunk of their capital because it is frozen out, the effect is the same.

I've heard people estimate that he has somewhere between 100k and 200k bitcoins in his personal wallets at this point, legitimately earned through operating profits of his company, or bought very early on when the price was negligible.
If that's true, then I think that, for Mark, stealing is absolutely unnecessary at this point. What he needs is a way to wind down the company and cash out, without going to jail or being killed by some antagonist.
There was a time where MtGox was practically the only exchange going, and the only way for his bitcoins to grow in value or even maintain their value was for Mark to continue to operate it. If he just "took the money and ran", then the price of a Bitcoin would have crashed to zero and made his heist pointless.
Now that there are other exchanges besides gox, the price can remain relatively high even when gox is crashing and burning. This makes the coins that Mark holds still worth something, even if gox closes down tomorrow.
I think he is running the company into the ground so that he can retire on his huge bitcoin hoard, and somehow maintain the value of that hoard or even increase it.
Whether he is doing this consciously or unconsciously is not clear, but the ultimate outcome of all of this is that if gox folds, the lawsuits go away, the criminal charges go away, and his possibly stressful full time job of having to keep putting out fires with their shitty software goes away too.
Maybe the feds are pressuring him to keep it open, because they have their claws into him and are monitoring all of his transactions, and they'd like to be able to keep doing that, and he is doing all he can to sabotage it and make it naturally implode, so that it goes bankrupt and he doesn't look like the one who shut it down?

He apparently doesn't want to, but I will try to.
Bitcoin itself is decentralized, but it is currently traded on two or three main exchanges, Bitstamp, BTC-E and (if you believe their reported order volumes) Huobi. These exchanges are completely centralized.
While there are many other, smaller exchanges, only these three are big enough to affect "the price", and indeed "the price" is typically calculated by taking an average of these three markets.
It's trivial to set up an account on all three exchanges and load each one with, say, 100 million dollars worth of Bitcoin.
Some of the early players in the market / the guys that hacked any of the big exchanges / digital wallets etc have easily that much and more. It's difficult for them to cash out too much without arousing suspicion, and there's only so many drugs you can buy on the dark markets.
So you go into business as a currency manipulator. All you do is set up trading bots (which all three sites accommodate with their APIs) and have them perform particular trades under certain conditions.
Rally looking like it's breaking out? Sell exactly as many coins as it takes to squash it. Price looks like it might be on the slide? Buy up all the weak hands' coins as they flush them away.
You only really need a few million to make this work, and it's trivial for these big players to keep the price stable. They can also trigger massive buys and massive sells, by tipping the market one way or another at a critical point.
Now some of these big players know one another, and they get together and plan big spikes in the price or big dips. It's very easy to make this happen in the Bitcoin market, as most traders are very green, and will simply follow the trend as they see it being painted on the graph. There are also thousands of trade bots which aren't programmed very well, and will follow the herd.
So you simply: 
- Collude with your buddies to keep the price fixed for a few months.
- Once people have a false sense of security, slowly sell off a huge amount of Bitcoin.
- Once you've built up a significant USD balance on the three exchanges, trigger a panic sell by selling a lot of coins very quickly
- Once the price starts to slide on its own, start buying up every coin you can
- Carry on buying at a slow rate until the price stabilises back near where it was.
- ????
- Profit.

The TOS no longer applies once the company is dissolved as part of a liquidation suit. 
Standard liquidation rules will apply: Gather up all assets (including the 200k BTC), sell them all, put all the money in a big pot and pay off creditors in the correct order (Customers last).
Customers who are owed fiat will be paid some of what they are owed, if there is any left after MtGox pays its other creditors.
Customers who are owed BTC will not get anything, unless there is still some fiat left after paying off all the customers with fiat balances, then they might get some token amount (assuming they have a bank account registered with Gox etc).

Any evidence that the 3 websites you posted actually make any money and aren't just massive targets for scammers / hackers?
I do take your point though, it's possible to operate similar services with Bitcoin as it is to Fiat. Banks could carry on offering loans, investments and deposits with Bitcoin, but without the safety net of working with a federally-issued currency, they are taking much more of a risk for the same or less reward.
Providing services for gold isn't all that profitable. It was when the price was continually increasing, but now it's going down a lot of banks are refusing to touch it or have ratcheted up their fees. The same would happen to Bitcoin.


"Hope" doesn't make new banks come into existence. Money does. Shit-tonnes of money. It's very difficult to get enough money to start a new bank, because the existing banks have it all. 
For that reason, new banks *don't* pop up all the time to increase competition to existing banks. The "Free Market" doesn't exist in banking, only collusion and price fixing. Brock wants to give these institutions control over exchanging to and from Bitcoin? Pssh.

No other exchange is inherently "safe", just as no bank is safe and no financial service provider is "safe". The point is that these companies and organisations are "trusted", because of their history of good transactions and respectable conduct, not because it is impossible for them to screw you over.
One could just as easily ask:
"if it can happen to Fannie Mae, is any other mortgage broker safe?"
"if it can happen to Enron, is any other accountancy firm safe?"
"if it can happen to Greek government bonds, is any government bond safe?"
The answer to all of these questions is of course, "no". Nothing is inherently safe, any financial transaction anyone ever enters into carries with it an element of risk.
Clearly for Bitcoin exchanges, the risk is significantly higher than dealing with traditional financial companies, that's why the potential reward is so much higher. 
To imagine Chase bank as "safe" or the Bank of America as "safe" is not very wise.

BTC-E updated their wallet client yesterday to resolve the bug. Took about 1 hour. It was working perfectly before they updated it, but I guess as an exchange they want to be extra sure, so they patched their wallet. I requested an 0.1 BTC withdraw 3 hours ago, it's in my wallet now.
There are still speed issues on the network due the DoS working on miners using outdated clients, but that's not going to go away until the attacker goes away really. Not sure what "working round the clock" will really do to resolve that... Unless we have Bitcoiners in the FBI?

This is not unique to bitcoin. For example if you want to take $20 out of your checking account, if you use your credit card at the tourist ATM at the airport you might have to pay $5, but if you use your debit card at the ATM attached to your bank it's free.

I think you're confused about what Limited Liability actually sets out to do.

@_date: 2014-03-04 17:31:57
Not exactly, no. All you would need is for the software you use to accept bitcoins at the bar to give a simple yes / no based on transaction propagation to trusted nodes. This could be the Mycelium "super nodes",  or maybe a couple of miners the barkeeper has set up in his basement, or maybe both, whatever.
Your cash register, or hand held bitcoin accepting device or whatever could simply turn red for invalid transactions or green once the transaction had successfully propagated to your list of trusted nodes. This doesn't take very long, maybe 30 seconds or so. Quicker if your trusted nodes are all local.
It does require a bit of technical expertise, does require you to mine bitcoin and still doesn't perfectly eliminate risk (What if my miners and the mycelium super nodes have all been compromised!), but I think it's a perfectly fine level of security to use for low-value, low-risk transactions like drinks at a bar.

@_date: 2014-07-11 09:10:43
No it isn't that simple. Bitcoin doesn't make money. 
There is no interest paid, no dividends, no yields, no futures. The only way banks can make money off Bitcoin is either by charging high fees for Bitcoin services (which would be instantly undercut by the Bitcoin community), or by assuming significant risk and investing in Bitcoin directly themselves.
Banks do like money, they like the money they can charge people for their services. Bitcoin makes many of these services redundant, and doesn't offer any profitable alternatives for the banks.
As you say, they're not allowed to muscle in on the only profitable part of Bitcoin, running an exchange.
Banking fees are determined by "The Market" are they? Well that's a good one ;) I suppose "The Market" allows for new startup banks to come along and undercut the existing, established banks, does it? 
And here was me thinking the number of banks was shrinking, not growing. When was the last time a new bank opened and went into competition with existing ones? When was the last time a new credit card provider entered "The Market" to undercut Visa, Mastercard and Amex?
No, in fact Banks collude together to fix fees at a higher price. As do Mastercard, Visa, Amex and *cough* Discover.
Sorry but free market economics don't apply to monopolistic institutions like banks.

Not really. It's illustrative of a misconception about why people run nodes.

Casual users running a full node are in a tiny minority.
Enthusiasts have an incentive to run a node, Miners don't have much of one if they mine in a pool.

Yes, probably.
But when the corporations control the copyright laws and the elites get to decide what counts as "terrorism", then services like these are absolutely required to maintain a free and functional democracy.
"Legitimate" is a word which can be defined by whoever uses it.
You don't get to have true freedom without also supporting the freedoms of others who you might not agree with. People will absolutely use the service for the type of content you describe, but that doesn't make it a bad service. If anything, it simply proves that it is beyond the reach of the elites and the corporations.

I assume from your absolute vehemence and utter blind faith in what's "right" and "fair" that you have coins stuck in Gox?
Sorry bud, there's no legal precedent here. It sucks, but all those coins belong to Gox, and there's nothing you can do to force them to give you them back. They hold fewer coins than they owe people, so there's no fair way to do it.
You can scream until you're blue in the face about how those are *your* funds in *your* account, you can even join one of the various class-action suits against MtGox if you want, it's not going to make any difference.
MtGox was not a bank, it was not a financial institution and it was not bound by any laws which typically govern user account balances and so on. 
In the case that you have fiat money that Gox owes you, there is a good chance that you will get it back as part of the liquidation, but it's likely to take years.
In the case that you have Bitcoins, no way josé. Regardless of the ambiguous and tenuous language in their TOS, the 200k coins they "found" will be sold off in order to pay their very real fiat debts.
You don't own the bitcoins that you "had" on Gox, and you never did.

There are many examples of the NSA installing their own equipment into datacenters of companies they wish to monitor. There are also many examples of the NSA and the FISA court serving gag orders to prevent the company being monitored disclosing it.
This is not really a "what if" question, it's really a "how common is this practice" question. I would imagine that many, many US VPN providers have been approached by the NSA and now have listening equipment in their datacenters, which they are forbidden from talking about and knowing about what they're listening to or how.

That is a very sub-optimal decision. You absolutely should not spend money directly from your savings account.
Finding anywhere paying 4-5% interest in 2014 is pretty incredible, so you're either lying or you've found an amazing deal on a savings account that allows external debits to be made on it. Can I ask where it is?
To be able to spend your money while travelling, the most effective way is to do it is with a credit card with very low international fees. Halifax offer a good one which I use, called "Clarity". There's zero fees for using it, even for withdrawing from ATMs abroad, and they charge no commission on their currency conversions. 
You do of course end up paying a tiny amount on the forex spread when paying in foreign currencies from your GBP balance, but it's less than half a percent, and a damn sight better than any forex spread I've ever seen anywhere else.
When I'm in the US, their ATMs do add fees locally, so I use my clarity card for spending, and for getting cash out I use my Citibank account, which accepts deposits in GBP and converts at almost dead on spot rate to USD. Its just a standard US debit card but registered to me in the UK. So no charge for using Citibank ATMs, which you can find in most places in the US.
In your case, if you want to make an optimal decision, you should be taking the money you want to use out of your high interest account and using it to pay off your Clarity credit card before it acrues any interest, and/or to add funds to your USD Citibank account.

If you say taxes are theft to people *with* elaborating, you still sound ridiculous and insane.
The members of are very Libertarian, and while these ideas are pretty interesting and promising, they are *not* held by the general public.
Pretty much everyone can see that a customs officer taking tens of thousands of dollars away from a nice old lady is bad, and wrong. You will have no difficulty convincing people that government should not be able to seize people's funds simply because they are crossing a border. This is a plus for Bitcoin.
To conflate that idea with the entire concept of taxation is intellectually dishonest and completely at odds with what the vast majority of people think. Most people grudgingly pay their taxes, and pretty much everyone does understand that they are necessary to provide essential government services.
Only a very small fringe of libertarian kooks believe that there should be zero taxation. To try and sell Bitcoin on this idea does far more harm than good in my opinion.

They had been drowning for months. I think they put in limits to how much BTC you were allowed to take out per day. Then any big withdraws which were still under the limit "mysteriously failed", only to be "reset" after a couple of weeks of being ignored by support.
So yeah, even before the complete shutdown of BTC withdraws there were serious problems with moving large amounts of BTC off the exchange. I think if you tried to get your BTC out before June / July last year you could do it.

It's as simple to copy and paste 1EVOEIRBJRE2343987FEOJ as it is to copy and paste MyPaymentName, surely?
Bitcoin addresses look weird and scary to noobs because they're not used to seeing those addresses, but then email addresses and website addresses used to look weird and scary to people who weren't used to seeing them, too. These days nobody thinks twice about it.
Back when phone numbers went from 4 digits to 7 digits people thought nobody would ever be able to remember or use a number that long so they invented that dumb system of replacing numbers with letters on the phone keypad. These days, nobody uses that.
Personally I find Bitcoin addresses beautiful. They're perfect in form and function. And actually, getting one letter wrong due to a typo in a bitcoin address will normally result in an invalid address and it won't send. Getting "OneName" wrong and typing "OneMame" instead might result in a successful payment to someone who is just squatting typos, in the same way that people squat Amazom.com and Foogle.com etc.

Sorry but this argument is entirely invalid. It's not a "Big problem" with Bitcoin, and I'm not even convinced it's a problem whatsoever.
99.9% of US dollars were already "mined" before I was even born, and yet that currency went "mainstream" no problems at all.
A small number of people holding dollars now already have a very large share of the world's total wealth. Bitcoin doesn't entirely solve this issue, but it does redress the balance a little.
Now we have one guy with over 30% of all wealth, and a handful of guys with between 1% and 2%, and a huge number of people with a little. These people are *like us*, geeks, crypto nerds, drug users, cool guys.

PBOC could not give a single shit about social problems caused by borrowed money and gambling. Chinese casinos and gambling houses are the most profitable businesses in China, their whole culture is based around games of chance, winning and losing money. Bitcoin trading as a form of gambling is a perfect fit for Chinese culture.
What PBOC do care about is rich Chinese circumventing capital controls in and out of China.
There is a fixed limit to how much Yuan you are allowed to send outside of China each year, and this helps to keep their import / export ratio strong.
What the rich Chinese want more than anything else is western goods. They want wine and cheese from France, cars from Germany, watches from Switzerland, fur coats from Austria, and so on. They can't buy this stuff directly, because the Chinese govt won't let them send their money overseas. They have to settle for Chinese-produced goods, which tend to be complete crap.
Bitcoin can bypass this by allowing everyday Chinese to buy Bitcoins locally, without sending the Yuan out of China, sending the Bitcoins to BTC-E, and exchanging them for Euros or Dollars. It allows the Chinese a "back channel" for getting their money out of the country. That is why the PBOC are scared.
At the moment the volumes are tiny, so while it's on their radar, they can live with it. There is more illegal USD / Yuan trading going on from paper bags outside the front of the banks by the yellow exchangers than is being conducted in Bitcoin. But over time, as bitcoin's value surges and surges, the PBOC will be forced to take more of an interest.

I think I can go one better.
Gox hadn't gotten around to installing a speedo in their car yet and was using their rev counter and gear ratio to determine their speed, but there was a known issue with the car which meant that gear ratio could be changed by an attacker who wanted them to get a speeding ticked. Gox never read up about the gear ratio problem and assumed that their method of determining speed was correct.
When they got pulled over by the cops and given a speeding ticket which wiped out a lot of their funds, they blamed the car company for not fixing the gear ratio problem and not themselves for failing to install the speedo.
Now they refuse to drive anywhere at all until someone comes and fixes their car for them, so they can carry on driving it by looking at the rev counter and calculating their speed based on what gear they are in...

A little "coin to bitcoin" box at an airport or international ferry terminal seems like it could make a killing. Insert coins via a standard coin mech, print out a QR code for some bitcoins, or transfer them to a specified address...

Of course I have. None of what you're saying makes Bitcoin a bad or less attractive payment method though.
Yes, if you were buying some stuff from a shady retailer who you didn't trust to deliver the goods, Bitcoin would probably be your less preferred option over Paypal and Payment Card.
But for the vast majority of transactions, which you place with companies with a proven history of actually delivering goods, Bitcoin is a great method, and much cheaper for the merchant than accepting Paypal or Payment Card.

Option 2 would appear to be good for those of us holding Bitcoins though. 
"Confidence" in Bitcoin is not tied to Gox any more, has not been for at least 2 years.
Lets say that Bitcoin just shut up shop, Karoffles is dead / missing / whatever and all coins held in gox are basically lost forever because they formatted the servers in one last act of vandalism.
Anyone holding coins anyhwere other than Gox just increased their overall share without doing anything.
@_date: 2014-03-19 13:10:06


Simple. The system continues because even stolen Bitcoins are still Bitcoins.
Money does not become invalid just because it is stolen, despite what the money laundrering laws of the fiat world tell you.
Money is money. If you lose it, or have it taken from you, you lost it. If I take a $20 bill from your wallet, it doesn't magically vanish or disappear, it becomes *my* $20, and I can spend it.
If I steal a million dollars, those are *my* million dollars now. If you wanted to keep them, you should have taken better care of them.
@_date: 2014-06-03 22:35:57
Inside your own country it's a little pointless to send an individual Bitcoin, unless you want to avoid having a transaction that can be tracked back to your bank account for some reason...
If it's someone in your own country, 99 times out of 100 it is cheaper just to do a bank transfer, or hand them cash.
However, if you're talking about a business which accepts money online, say Newegg.com for example, an American website, it's *significantly* cheaper, simpler and lower-risk for them to accept Bitcoin from Americans than it is for them to accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Paypal.
The consumer might not immediately see the benefit of that, as they appear to be charged nothing to use those payment methods, but a business who uses Bitcoin is in a position to charge their customers less for their products, or at least offer a discount for using Bitcoin.

Oh sorry. I thought you were talking USD ATMs charging 5% to withdraw from a fiat bank account.
You're right, the fees are necessary. There's no way to operate within the banking cartels without them,
But nobody would have called Xapo evil, corporate retards if they hadn't offered a product with no fees to begin with, only to change their mind at the last minute.
If they had stated from day one that there would be a $5 monthly fee, and high fees for using the card, people would have shrugged and accepted it.
Honest mistake or not, it makes them look bad. If anything, it makes them look worse than the very banks and institutions they're trying to replace, and no amount of apologizing will fix that.
I guess they realise that, which is why they're staying silent on their blog and on twitter about it.

It is kind of their own fault. The writing has been on the wall for some time now. They chose to ignore it because gox had much higher prices than everywhere else. Which in itself should have been a warning sign.
If you had more BTC than you could reasonably afford to lose tied up in *any* exchange rather than in private, secure wallets, let alone in gox, you only have yourself to blame.
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:29:17
You would not. Since you are posting a loss in Fiat, your company is making a loss, and you don't pay taxes on losses.
Any bitcoin you purchased would be counted as expenses, not stock (since there's nothing to actually hold, it can't be stock or an asset). Any you received as payment would not be counted in your accounting at all.
If you ran a web shop that only accepted Bitcoin, as far as your tax accountant would be concerned, you would simply be sending items to your customers without taking any payment for them. Where would the tax become due? Who would collect it? as far as I'm aware the IRS does not have a bitcoin address to send tax to.
Why do you think companies such as Amazon and StarBucks register themselves in Ireland or The Cayman Islands etc then operate the "main" part of the company at a loss, but pay all of their profits as "management fees" to the Irish / Caymanese company?
If a company operates in US dollars, it has to pay some taxes to the US. If a company operates in Euros in Ireland, it ends up paying taxes to Ireland. 
Bitcoin is not officially recognised as a currency by any government, therefore no taxes can be applied to it in any jurisdiction.

I'm not neccesarily talking about the "big trustworthy names". There are more use-cases for buying stuff than just cooltv.freewebs.com and Amazon.com. Those are the two extremes, there are thousands of little and medium companies in between with good reputations.
For example HumbleBundle, Overstock, Scan.co.uk etc.
By the way, I've worked on the online retail side for a couple of the largest retailers in the world, and while they do get some volume discount on merchant fees for "cardholder not present" transactions, it's nothing like as much of a discount as you think it is. 
It's absolutely not a bargain, and the cost is going up all the time. What can you do about it? Go fuck yourself that's what. Visa and Mastercard have a huge monopoly, so if Visa come to you and say "hey, your merchant fees just went up by another 10%", you can't tell them to go jump, since *not* accepting Visa would be commercial suicide. 
The big retailers are actually opening their own *banks* to get around having to pay merchant fees. That's how big an issue it is. The reasoning goes that if they are actually a bank as well as a retailer, they can charge *themselves* merchant fees. They are being forced into the position of "If you can't beat them, join them". Even then, Visa and Mastercard will still be taking a pretty big cut.
The extra money they have to pump into stuff like fraud prevention and security uses up the money they save by getting a discount merchant fees three times over. Bigger retailer = bigger target for fraud &amp; less able to spot it happening.
So yes, even a huge company with a huge web turnover, the size of Amazon , Walmart or Best Buy could save a *lot* of money by allowing customers to pay with Bitcoin. It would save them having to pump billions into setting themselves up as banks, for one thing.

The question is should the police be concerned about catching criminals or should the banks, and anyone else who handles money?
The implication that my bank, or anyone who wishes to act as a financial intermediary is as accountable for stopping crime as the police are is somewhat laughable.
What money laundering laws attempt to assert is that the proceeds of crime are somehow not permitted to be treated as money. This is not the case. Money is money, wherever it comes from.
We have gone too far in the fight against crime. Money laundering laws are just one example of that.

if i had a botnet and wanted to connect it to storj for profit, which sounds like a pretty good idea, I doubt I would waste my time creating virtual machines on the same host, much less giving all of those virtual machines individual IPs.
Theres no financial incentive for me to pretend that one machine is actually 100, it still has the same amount of diskspace and bandwidth available. But there is an amount of effort required to do that. if youre also talking about giving virtual machines multiple internet ip addresses, that starts to get insanely difficult.

Indeed. Gox very much needs the price of Bitcoin to fall right now, and fall a *lot*, otherwise it cannot pay out to all its customers who are frantically trying to get their money out.
- They tried to crash the price by pretending Bitcoin was broken - fail
- They tried to crash the price by selling 8000 BTC all at once on BTC-E - fail
- Now they try to crash the price by DDOS the entire BTC network. Again fail.
Sooner or later they will just have to admit defeat and tell everyone that they just don't have enough money to cover all their deposits, because over the past few years people have been scamming coins from their hot wallet with this txid trick.

For me it's like an asset. 
Imagine if MtGox was trading gold bars instead of Bitcoins. And you sent them 10 bars of gold, which you immediately sold for dollars, withdrew 50% of the dollars, waited for a price drop, bought back in, but kept some fiat in reserve, and ended up with $3423 and 2.7 gold bars showing on your gox account.
Then gox goes bust, with everyone's fiat in their bank accounts, and with everyone's gold bars in their vault - including the original 10 that you sent them.
Do they have to give you back the $3423? Well maybe, since you effectively sold them the gold you sent in and they still have to pay you for it. And in any case, they haven't physically got possession of those dollars, their bank does. Their bank can be instructed legally by whoever takes over their business as part of the liquidation, there are laws in place and provisions on business bank accounts which allow for that. It's likely that in a liquidation, you would get the dollars owed to you.
The 6.7 gold bars that is on your MtGox ledger, that's much less clear and up for debate. Did you really ever own those, or were they just a number on a database somewhere?
To further complicate matters, a liquidator would not necessarily have the ability, authority or means to access gox's vault and take 6.7 bars out and securely send them to you. It might not even be possible for them to access the vault, it might be made out of ultra-strong titanium or something... Gox might have the vault in a secret location known only to Mark, and Mark might be dead. Or, they might not have the expertise to break down a bar to a 0.7-sized chunk without it losing considerable value. There are a lot of factors that may lead to you not getting what you thought you were owed.
A judge might rule that rather than sending you the gold bars owed to you according to the ledger, they owe you 6.7 bars worth of Dollars, at current market rates. 
Or they might equally rule that you took the risk in leaving the bars under Gox's control, and actually all of those bars in Gox's vault are actually the company's assets, and you don't own any of them. All you *actually* own is an account on Gox's database, backed with promise that the company would send you the value of that account on request, if it were available and they had the resources to fill your request. Something like a promissory note
But yeah, all of this is highly speculative and theoretical at this point. Obviously people who are directly impacted by these decisions will have *very* strong opinions about them. It will be fascinating to see how this all plays out.

I don't think so. I think HBO are more than happy having Game of Thrones as the most downloaded show on earth. They almost seem to wear it as a badge of pride.
The insane amount of money they make from $80 boxsets is well worth a few fans getting huffy and uppity that the series is not available to stream on iTunes or whatever, and they don't have to pay a 30% cut to Apple if they release it on DVD and BluRay only.

Well no, not exactly. "Risk" implies that you accept there is a chance you will not get what you invest back again. There were never any guarantees or assurances that your money was safe. If you thought there were, you were a fool.
It would not be risk if you assume that the other party has all responsibility for your wealth. It was a semi-legal Bitcoin exchange being run out of Japan, not a branch of Chase.
Agreed, Gox "losing" the coins is certainly to blame for the overall losses, but users treating it like a bank are to blame for their personal losses.

Of course it shows the wrong balance, it's showing you the result of a duplicated transaction, created by an attacker. It doesn't know which duplicated transaction is invalid until one gets confirmed, which takes an hour or two, then the correct balance is displayed.
Could the client be modified to ignore duplicated transactions until they were confirmed? Sure. But it's still working as intended.
At most this is a UI bug. Admittedly a severe UI bug that temporarily misrepresents how rich you are, but a UI bug nonetheless.

Not necessarily. If your computer is compromised and the keys that you made into a paper wallet are logged by a wallet stealer etc, then there's no guarantee that the paper wallet is any more secure then a regular one.
The only way to be absolutely certain that your paper wallet is secure is to create the wallet on a fresh install which has never been on the internet, destroy that fresh install and THEN send the coins to that wallet.

However you do completely ignore that it is impossible to send money to 80 people in 80 countries for less, even if you use the most expensive possible exchange services and least favourable rates for Bitcoin, as you have in your example.
I live in the UK and the cheapest way for me to send money to one person outside the UK is £5 flat fee or 0.5%, whichever is higher. So in your example the 80 transactions of £1 would cost me £400, and I would have to perform telephone authorisation with my bank 80 times. It would take me over an hour just to perform the authorisations alone.

I get what you're saying, it is possible for you to fake it and have all the data in one place rather than distributed. I'm just saying nobody will bother to do that. 
I presume storj will pay by number of bytes stored and transferred, not by number of IP addresses and clients on the network. I presume that data will be both encrypted and randomly distributed, and no two distributed chunks will be the same.
In which case, 'Faking it' would be a lot more complex and difficult than just running the client for real, and would be no more profitable. In fact, all the obfuscation would almost certainly slow down transfer speeds, so you'd earn less overall.
A few people might do what you're suggesting 'just because', but I hardly see it as a cause for concern.

Pretty high, unless you're a bank with your own network of ATMs. In that case you can often arrange to share access with the other ATM owners. Their customers get to user your ATMs, your customers get to use theirs, and the costs are more-or-less neutral. What this does is create a kind of "club" of ATM operators, and they are very hostile toward letting others in.


Nope. There are many unavoidable costs built into the system, and the money goes to various participants in the ATM "club". Even if Visa agreed to let you use their network for free, they have complicated contracts and deals already set up with the big banks and other card operators, which you still end up having to pay.


I could tell you, but we'd be here all week. Basically Visa, Mastercard and Amex, along with a consortium of "tier 1" banks, can decide to charge whoever they want whatever they want, on a case-by-case basis.

However, that's not what public notaries do. In the US a notary would not really get involved in a liquidation, and actually in Japan I don't think they even have something like a public notary.
It will be a company of lawyers that specialises in handling funds from liquidations, a "Trustee". The trustee will need to be selected and offer a competitive tender, and this will almost certainly be a percentage of the "other people's money" which they return to the people who it is owed to. 
This is how these companies make their money, by leeching off others, and they aren't particularly cheap.
Given the sums involved I would imagine that $10m would be roughly what they end up getting.
But certainly not $10m upfront and then a percentage on top of that, that's blatant highway robbery. The Sunlot plan is obviously a cynical one intended to maximise payment for the trustee at the expense of the creditors, while offering a glimmer of false hope that Gox will somehow magically reopen.

RackSpace, Azure, AWS can all arbitrarily delete your hosted files for any reason, without telling you why.
They can see which of your files are being accessed, by whom and, if you don't encrypt, they can see the full content as well.
Storj makes it impossible for anyone bar the owner of the private keys to delete or modify the files held. It also distributes the files over multiple hosts in multiple countries with multiple ip homes.
At the cheapest tier, AWS, RackSpace, Azure etc all use single-homed servers. While it is relatively rare for these servers to crash or get DDOS'd, it does happen. Storj minimises the likelyhood that your files will not be available when you need them.
It is the perfect place to store, for example, your Bitcoin wallets.
Since the files hosted cannot be taken down by copyright notices or legal pressure from any world government, it also makes it a perfect place to store pirated files or otherwise sensitive data.

Incorrect. "Most of the money" resides in offshore tax havens such as Switzerland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Belize, The Cayman Islands etc.
You might be implying that the US *economy* is the biggest, and you'd be right. It produces 25% of the worlds profits.
However, very little of that money which passes through the mighty US economy actually stays inside the US. 
The US dollar might be the defacto currency of the oil market and various others, but US banks are certainly not the defacto place to store it. The US is cash-poor, income rich, with *lots* of debt.
What actually happens is that US companies borrow from other, *actually* rich countries like China, Saudi Arabia and so on, then any profits they manage to make after paying interest are syphoned off to the tax havens.
The US is actually broke. The richest poor country in the world.

They are trying their best to make them matter. The Trans-Pacific-Partnership tries to enforce American copyright laws on other countries, extradition treaties perform a similar function.

That's not what Net Neutrality means.
Net Neutrality was a specific bill tabled in the US congress, calling for a law to make US internet companies treat all packets equally, whether those packets originated from Online poker, Netflix, Wikipedia, or their own video streaming services.
This has now been struck down, thanks in part to people like Senator Ted Stevens arguing that the Internet is not a truck and cannot support all the material. It's a series of tubes and sometimes stuff gets stuck in the tubes!
As a result, Comcast (who also runs the main Cable TV service in the US, in direct competition with Netflix) can throttle Netflix traffic, making sure that its users cannot see Netflix in high quality.
They don't have to give any reasoning for this, since there is no Net Neutrality law, they can just do it.

Yes but Lehman Brothers operated in the Fiat economy whereas Gox operates in the Bitcoin economy.
They actually accounted for about 20% of all bitcoin trades worldwide, which would certainly make them "too big to fail" if they were operating in the Fiat economy and had been dealing with 20% of all fiat transactions worldwide.
The point is that with Bitcoin, unlike fiat, there is no central authority to "bail out" its biggest companies, even if they are central to BTC like Gox was.

That would have to be one incredibly forward-thinking trustee...
I would assume the more likely scenario is that the 200k wallet is sold by the trustee to a private buyer, for an amount considerably below its true value.
If the trustee is particularly savvy, it may divide it up into 200 lots of 1000BTC each and sell them in some kind of auction. 
Either way, we will see. It will be certainly very interesting and a world first, since the FBI apparently haven't done anything with the coins they seized from Silkroad yet, and it looks like they may never actually do anything with them.
I'm sure there are plenty of people out there willing to pay $200+ per coin to a trustee for Goxcoins. Enough to allow them to cover all of their Fiat debt and then perhaps starting to look at how to compensate their BTC debtors with what little they have left.
What absolutely is not going to happen is a liquidation trustee signing up to Bitstamp and selling the coins on the open market.

Lets say the idea is a roaring success, and not only all the major US banks but European and Asian banks get in on the act too.
Soon, converting to and from Realcoin becomes the defacto method for cashing in and out of Bitcoin. Fiat Bitcoin exchanges close down due to lack of interest, and change into Realcoin Bitcoin exchanges.
After a year or two of this, then the US Treasury decides that the dollar is inflating too fast, and blames everyone converting their money to Bitcoin, via Realcoin.
They order the banks to stop offering Realcoin services, and the banks comply.

People trusted gox with half a billion dollars because of its good brand name, previous history of good customer support and verified trade history, which left people confident that money going into Gox would come out again.
All of that is now ruined, the brand name is synonymous with failure, the history of good customer support has been torn to shreds, and the verified trade history has this massive "OMG WUT" black hole in it. 
So there is really nothing that Gox has or is, which could possibly earn back the shortfall of $350 million that they need just to break even.

Probably, yeah. But you don't *need* a PIN terminal to accept credit cards. You don't need any kind of terminal at all, in fact. You can take an ink imprint using a manual swiping machine.
Just like you don't *need* anything special to accept Bitcoin. Just a QR code printed on a bit of paper, and a smartphone to check if transactions confirm. If you completely trust your customer, then you don't even need that.
To accept in-person transactions from customers using a debit card and / or a credit cards, using Chip and PIN, you certainly do *need* a lot of different equipment, licenses and bank agreements. All of this costs.
Apparently the ATM they got is zero fee, but they might be being charged to operate it.. Probably. But I'm not sure accepting debit cards would be cheaper, no.
I'm not sure how that's saving the customer hassle at all actually, requiring them to think about what kind of card they are using, is it a Debit card or a Credit card... well it says "VISA" on the front, and I'm in  credit... so...

Of course you should accept a reasonable level of risk. Use Kraken, it's a very low risk site. You most likely won't lose your money if you send them it, then trade it for bitcoins, and you most likely will get your money if you send them bitcoins and ask for a withdrawal.
What I'm advising against is to stupidly use them like a bank / stockbroker and placing $100k+ there to trade on a daily basis for the long term. 
You are pants on head retarded if you leave a significant amount of money entrusted to a company like that, even if they are 100% honest and trustworthy, have the greatest security ever devised and are paragons of the Bitcoin community, they are still unregulated, uninsured against losses and at significant risk of being shut down at any time by the banks and powers that be. The longer you leave a significant amount of funds on there, the higher the chance that you won't be able to get them out again.

Maybe because when they set up the Bitstamp account, they were not under intense pressure from traditionalists, but after they set up the Bitstamp account, their bank is under extreme scrutiny and pressure from actors in the banking industry who are against Bitcoin.

Wrong. The average punter does care about banks having too much power and control. The average punter blames the banks for the 2008 global financial collapse and subsequent recession.
Do they care *enough* to experience a small amount of inconvenience and risk, by using Bitcoin? perhaps not, but these risks and inconveniences are reducing all of the time.
My "pitch" is simply:
*"Bitcoin exists, you can use it to buy things and it is not controlled by the banks or any central entity. If you're curious, come and try it out."*
This is usually enough for most people to at least become somewhat interested.
For most people, this pitch works a lot better, but you need a close and trusted relationship with them:
*"Bitcoin exists, you can use it to buy stuff and it can't be traced. There's websites online where you can buy literally any drug with Bitcoin, it gets posted through your door and is the best quality shit you've ever had."*

It doesn't, but that's what a liquidation suit implies.
What happens during liquidation is that all of the dissolved company's assets are placed into the hands of an appointed trustee, who has responsibility for selling them at the best possible price in the shortest possible time, in order to pay back the people that the dissolved company owes money to.
Since the 200k wallet is pretty much their only asset with any value, then that will be the main thing that the trustee does, sell it and divide up the money.

Problem is if you don't keep all your BTC on an exchange, you miss the action. It takes nearly an hour to xfer BTC on to an exchange from a wallet, much longer if that exchange deliberately delays incoming transactions.
So by the time your BTC gets to the exchange, you've already missed the pump and dump, and your ability to make profit.
Greed is the reason people keep their coins on the exchanges. And for once they have been punished for their greed.

Well to be fair, they said it would be free. So no, you just had to believe what they said. And when they said they had $40M in venture capital, which was confirmed to be true, you might have assumed that would be how they could afford to pay the banking fees, not that they were outright lying about the card being free.


They had $40M in capital. And if I were to get something like this off the ground, I would not advertise a business model that I had no idea of whether or not it could work.
I would not entice customers with a free service then, after I had secured some customers, jack up the fees to well above average market rate.

I've added exactly the required number of variables.
Here are things which can and will change in the next year:
- Bitcoin Price
- Bitcoin Difficulty
- Overall Network Hash Rate
- Cost of mining hardware
- Speed of mining hardware
- Average Energy efficiency of active mining hardware
None of these are directly linked and all can and do change independently of one another.
Two of these variables, total hash rate and average energy efficiency make up the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network.
Total hash rate can be and often is influenced by both bitcoin price and mining hardware cost, but is not always.
Energy efficiency will continually fall as ASIC manufacturers strive to improve performance.
Ultimately, the total energy required to hash Bitcoin will most likely increase, but not proportionally with users or value of Bitcoin, the continual increases in energy efficiency of mining hardware are the main reason for that.

Really? It has a viewership of 6.6 million in the US on HBO alone. Add in International viewers and you're up to well over 15 million, and that's just the people paying for it through cable subscriptions.
They could make a very good profit just charging those people $1 an episode, rather than forcing them to sign up to a 12-month HBO subscription, or similar subscription plan in their own country.
However, when you look at the number of people pirating it, the numbers get fairly staggering. It's estimated that anywhere between another 10 and 50 million people watch Game of Thrones worldwide each week through torrents.
If even 20% of these people paid $1 an episode, they could add another $2M to $10M per episode, putting them well into profit even with the absurd budget you're talking about.

Somewhat correct. While I don't *expect* Kraken to ever halt Bitcoin withdraws in the same way Gox did, it's silly to rule it out.
What if they started trading a million a day, and all of a sudden all of their bank accounts were frozen by the Fed?
Of course they'd have to call a halt to trading, USD deposits and USD withdraws, but do you think the site would remain functional enough for us to log in and withdraw the BTC we had in there?
What if you had traded your BTC to USD and were about to purchase BTC again when they called a halt to trading? You'd be screwed.
Would it be fair on people stuck in USD to allow BTC withdraws but not allow Fiat withdraws?
Would would the contingency plan be in case of catastrophic banking failure?

I agree that in this case forfeited is the same as stolen.
Money laundering is a grey area, I doubt many would see the ultra-libertarian view of "it's just free trade!" as correct. Many activities which require money to be laundered are not in the public good to remain illegal, and many are. So it's an interesting one.
However, there is a significant difference between taxation and extortion. Creating a false equivalency between the two makes Bitcoin supporters look like idiots.
Yeah, we get it, it's kind of the same thing as extortion, because they use force on you if you don't pay your taxes. Yeah, we get it, the government has no real mandate to govern in a state where fewer than half the electorate vote. 
But really, taxes are not extortion in any meaningful sense of the word. 
For someone who has accepted that taxes are necessary for a state to function, and who does not buy into the philosophy of "Destroy the state, we can do a better job of all of this without any formal system of government" - which is most people in the world - this just sounds like the demented ravings of a madman.

The 200k "found" wallet will be sold to pay for the various and significant expenses and debts that MtGox has.
All their servers and so on will also be sold (if they actually own any rather than rent them).
This is really the best outcome to the situation. At least after the 200k coins are finally sold, we can draw a line under gox and trade comfortably in the knowledge that nobody is about to take a giant shit on the market.

Agreed, but if they take 1% more donations because of bitcoin, and the other donations just carry on as they always have, then the bitcoin received is effectively "free" to the organisation. I don't see that they have anything to lose in that scenario by not cashing it in for a few years.

Easiest way is to let someone else handle the protection for you. 
Some simple security best practice for Bitcoin which is *good enough* for 99.9% of users:
- Get an online wallet from Blockchain.info.
- **USE A STRONG PASSWORD THAT YOU'VE NEVER USED ANYWHERE ELSE**
- **Don't** use that password anywhere else. Write it down on a bit of paper which you keep in your actual, physical wallet in your pocket. Don't ever write it anywhere on your computer (other than when you type it into Blockchain.info).
- Buy some coins from Bitstamp / whatever site you want.
- Immediately transfer your coins from Bitstamp / whatever site to your Blockchain.info wallet
- Never look at or export the private keys (The Import / Export Button, don't press it).
- Spend the coins from your Blockchain.info wallet. (Send Money)
Presto. Blockchain.info will keep your coins safe, you don't have to worry about getting into secure apps, 2FA, secure operating systems etc. Basically all the secuirty mumbo jumbo that people on this sub spend hours and hours talking about is fully handled for you, and it's pretty much impossible to hack your coins at this point.
The only weakness is if someone hacks your PC and gets your blockchain password, your coins are gone. But that's pretty much true of any security you could put on your Bitcoins anyway, if your computer gets hacked and someone installed a keylogger or whatever, your coins will be gone. (inb4 convulted "cold storage" methods and paper wallets etc.)
Above all, try not to get your PC hacked.

No, because the accounts don't actually have any BTC in them, just a number. When someone goes to withdraw BTC, they withdraw from the 'hot wallet', and gox keeps track of how much they were supposed to have in their gox account
when people have been complaining that they never got their funds, gox have simply been resetting their gox account back to what it was, without putting coins back into the hot wallet.
so yeah eventually the hot wallet ran dry before it 'should' have and thats when they disabled withdraws (because they ran out of coins)
the reality is that they have much less coins than they thought. not enough to cover everyone's balance probably.

@_date: 2014-08-12 12:49:06


Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
Taxes are collected by public servants, under the direct employ of the government. Tax rates are decided by laws, which are created by the democratic process. Taxation is entirely lawful, in fact a whole section of law is devoted exclusively to taxation, called "Tax Law" or "Tax Code". You can go to court and argue that you paid too much tax, and the tax collector can also take you to court for not paying enough.
Extortion is the act of one party extracting money from another illegally, with the threat of violence, force, blackmail or other negative consequences. Extortion is by definition unlawful. You cannot challenge the amount you paid in extortion legally, nor can your extortioner take you to court to demand you pay more.
You can argue in circles about what the money is used for, the idea of exchanging money with the mafia for "services", etc, but ultimately none of that really matters if you take the position that all governments are corrupt and all public expenditure is worthless, as many Bitcoiners do.
When you break it down with reductionism and reduce it to its most basic premise, Taxation and Extortion are very similar, but with two major differences:
- One is legal and one is illegal
- One can only be collected by a government, one can be collected by anyone.
These two differences alone are enough to warrant there being a different *word* for taxation and extortion, even if you think they are basically the same thing. They are also enough of a reason for people to look at you like a maniac when you try to interchange the two.
@_date: 2014-04-14 14:17:57
No. 
One is saying "We can sell this to you if you want to see it, pay for it please."
The other is saying "You're not allowed to see this unless you pay, we will use violence against you if you watch it without paying".
There's a very big difference.

Here's how I do it:
ME: Hey can I have a Bitcoin address to send you some Bitcoin?
FRIEND: Sure I'll just send it to you on gmail chat. *copy*, *paste*
ME: Thanks. I'll paste in mine too in case you want to send to me sometime. *copy*, *paste*.
It really doesn't have to be any more complex than that, and making it any more "convenient" than four mouse clicks is actually impossible. All you are doing by "innovating" is looking for ways to stop people actually seeing Bitcoin addresses.
I don't really understand what is wrong with Bitcoin addresses. I think they look cool.

Beg pardon? This is how bitcoin is *designed* to be used. The exchanges were never supposed to be where you kept it, it was always supposed to be held on your own PC in your own wallet. 
This is not an admission of failure on bitcoin's part, far from it. If anything, it proves exactly why the design was correct in the first place. You cannot trust others with your wealth.

Because they believe that they can make all the money they lost back again.
Through trading fees alone in the last 2 weeks they probably made quite a bit. We are all aware that it's a drop in the ocean compared with what they owe, but Gox staff will be hoping and praying that they can survive long enough to carry on trading without a bank run.

Perhaps unfair, but yes. This is a classic bait-and-switch tactic. The Bitcoin community has been burned by these many times in the past. Completely changing the nature of the product between Pre-Order and Fulfilment is a sure-fire way to create a toxic *image* of a lying, scamming company, even if that's not the case here. I don't know Wences personally, so I cannot say.
However, one would have hoped that a serious Bitcoin fanatic with the credibility and intelligence that Wences supposedly has, would not advertise a product with completely misleading, or downright false terms.

Calm down there mister truther. I think you're very confused about this. I offer no opinion on whether taxation is "right", I simply wish to correct your ridiculously incorrect use of language.
You're clearly not going to listen to a word I say anyway, so this is all a little pointless, but here goes.
When you talk about something which *isn't* a crime, like taxation, which is actually specifically and expressly *required to happen* by law, and you give it the same name as something which *is* a crime, like extortion, you sound like a moron.
Everyone gets it, we're not idiots. You think the government has no right to take money from people, and you think that they're no better than extortionists, because they use force to get the money. We know.
But when you deliberately and purposely use a word with another meaning, in this case an *opposite* meaning in terms of legality, you sound like a fucking moron. You immediately turn people off from your argument, and mark yourself as someone to be ignored.
It's not clever, it not going to change anyone's mind, it's not an effective way to communicate, and it confuses the point you're trying to make about government and their mandate to govern.
Just don't do it.
Sure, tell people that taxation is wrong, tell people that you think that the government is *basically the same* as the mafia, in that they take money from people by force, but don't simply *replace one word with another and expect people to know or care what you're talking about*.
That's pathetic, that's like using sarcasm in every sentence and expecting people to think you're cool. That's like something a 12 year old would do.
Talking about the world as you would like it to be does not make it so.

Well no, not really. Bank regulators can only shut down misbehaving banks. Bitcoin exchanges are a private enterprise, where bank regulators have zero jurisdiction.
Banks can close the fiat *accounts* of exchanges, and they frequently do, but the exchange can always go and open another one, or start using some other means of funding.
Right now, Bitcoin exchanges are undercutting banks on a number of their highly profitable services. On top of that, they're untouched by the myriad of regulation that banks must comply to. Banks have every reason to be jealous of Bitcoin exchanges, and every reason to want them (and consequently Bitcoin) to fail.
Imagining that these two warring tribes, bankers and Bitcoiners, could ever play nicely together is pure fantasy.
The shift of risk is moving Bitcoin exchange much closer to the purview of the banks and the bank regulators, by transforming it from a barter exchange as it is now, to an "official" financial service.
Not to mention the fees. I mean yeah they'll start low, but pretty quickly it would become cheaper to use credit cards than Bitcoin.

Well the Avalon is a 110nm chip, which is less impressive. Nevertheless the Avalon guys have done amazingly well too.
BFL have massively over-promised. They were naive and foolish in most of their decisions, and to take as many pre-orders as they have is extremely risky and gets peoples hopes up.
Even still, they've produced a working mining ASIC, something many said could not be done. It is an amazing achievement, albeit overshadowed by the delays and relentless optimism.

luke-jr is one of the biggest nerds on the internet and in the market. He is being a little sly here though, since he is *heavily* invested into BTC, he *hates* the idea of LTC.
Scrypt is vastly superior to SHA256, it is over 1000 times more difficult to hash, and is (as yet) ASIC proof.
Oh by the way, Luke-jr is HEAVILY invested into ASICs as well, hence his dislike / distrust of a non-ASIC crypto ;)

1: They will use them themselves. They've said a number of times that 1/3 of the miners they make will be used to mine Bitcoins and not sold.
2: As soon as they start being used in bulk, difficulty will shoot up, and they will be far less profitable.
3: Bitcoin value can go down as well as up.
4: You might be able to mine $100k worth of bitcoins, but try selling them. The price would tank.

He means that Avalon shipped a unit which uses many times more power than it ideally "should", if the PCB was up to spec and the power regulator was decent etc. It appears that their PCB manufacturer has been cutting corners with regard to energy efficiency. This can be said for both BFL and Avalon's PCBs, but Avalon never made any claims for energy efficiency, they just went all out for hashrate.
They are learning the hard way that the Chinese have the lowest cost to manufacture but unless you have your own people on the ground making sure they do it properly, what you get delivered is a pile of shit. I imagine that at least half of their PCBs will be absolute garbage.
"Pulling an Avalon" would appear to be saying "screw it, it works, slap a giant heatsink on it, wire up a 500W PSU and ship it anyway!".
In this case it's probably a good idea, with the difficulty the way it is and the cost per coin so high, I would suggest that all of the early adopters would still quite happily hash with their BFLs even if they drew 1000W and needed to be water-cooled with an aftermarket cooler. However will they be happy in 3 months time when the unit dies and fries the ASIC?
With a broken power regulator and a bad power brick, the BFL unit draws about 190W, significantly more than it should, yet still significantly lower than the Avalon, which draws 440W to produce almost the same hash rate.
While I'm sure a bit of "we're better than the competition" willy-waving comes into it - BFL will no doubt be smarting from being "beaten" to ship by Avalon, and want to brag about their hash-per-watt figures to make up for it - The more serious issue is that the PCB is surely not rated to operate at such a high wattage. 
They may be able to get one up and running and hashing now, but it's unlikely to last more than a few weeks operating at more than 10 times its rated power consumption. The chips themselves seem fine, it's the PCB that is going to be causing the issues.
