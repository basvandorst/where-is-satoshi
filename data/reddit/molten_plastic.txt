2018 The END of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:44:55
By luck I meant, timing the corrections. That's a BIG BALLS type of play. Not in my DNA. I think I'm like...50% Jew. LOL
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:06:10
Completely agree with your entire statement.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:51:33
This is one of the MOST irresponsible things I've seen here. Thankfully, no one reads this shit but the shills.
Giving this kind of advice to people is going to end up ruining people.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:25:00
Wow, you're so cool script kiddie!!
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:31:12
Litecoin, IOTA, XRP. All are better investments than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:22:29
I'm not trying to be. The writing has been on the wall for BTC for quite awhile. I'm very knowledgeable thank you very much. Not an expert by any means, but I know a sinking ship when I see one.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:05:53
I personally just hate BTC, and want to see it dead. So this is great. Just collecting some salt.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:14:22
I don't believe in Bitcoin. It's severely over valued. I believe in cryptocurrency. Mining isn't really viable anymore. Unless you have a mining farm, there's really little point. I never bought a miner, I just hacked around with it on my gaming PC at the time. I MAYBE had 3 or 4 coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:40:46
It has. Game over for btc. Hodl to the basement! Lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:30:29
I didn't buy at all, mined back in zero day and sold it for pennies. I don't want to hear about balls hurting. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:41:59
There's NEVER going to be a 100k lol. BTC won't survive that long bud.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:38:18
Lol ride it to Oblivion douche bag!
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:07:17
There are far better coins out there that actually DO something, that are cheaper, and because of that, have a MUCH higher potential return rate. Bitcoin is a fad. It WILL crash, and all these idiots in here that won't sell, are going to feel as stupid as the people who didn't buy at $1 when they did. The ONLY difference here, is if people were smart, and SOLD before it's all gone.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:37:52
Believe it. I loved the idea of it back when. I just gave up on it. Obviously didn't think it would do what it did. By the time it was 300 a coin, I thought for sure if lose any money I put in, and couldn't afford to lose money. I stand by that same feeling each time. Since then, better coins have come out, and I've invested heavily into them.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:03:24
Scroll to the bottom.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:17:23
Not at all. If you're looking for a little bump, ok. Invest. But if you're going into it thinking you're gonna be a millionaire like everyone in this sub that either mined years ago, or bought a hundred coins when they were three bucks a piece, you're deluding yourself. That's all I'm saying. You need to get on the ground floor of something else, and hope it follows a similar trend. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:35:42
I believe it cryptocurrency, I DON'T believe in Bitcoin. Again, like I said.. You bought in at the hundred dollar mark. Someone buying in right now is never going to see the returns you are, unless they are already rich and can buy a couple hundred bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:33:41
That was NOT my intention. I just wanted people to realize, it's too late to REALLY cash in like so many in this sub. You can still do well, but this is a prime example of needing money to make money.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:26:57
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:24:52
Totally get it. If it were me, and it is, I spent all that money into litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:32:28
No way it hits that much. It can't.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:03:38
Long term holding is exactly what I'm looking to do. What's the deal with this fork?
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:47:43
Which is why I put it into Litecoin. I was able to get just over 19 coins. Much better ROI if it follows the Btc trend.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:57:49
Ahahahaha. Bitcoin, is NEVER going to get anywhere NEAR that. Also, 32k is not allot of money. Not the millions upon millions the morons in here keep promising all the noobs coming in here asking if it's too late. It's too late for millions. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:22:55
And it's going to happen. Bitcoin, has, and always will have the stereotype of being used on silk road etc for nefarious uses. It's a script kiddie thing. It'll get shutdown. Cryptocurrency has its place, Bitcoin is not the answer. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:02:55
I'll be able to buy direct from Coinbase, and right into my Trezor right?
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:17:05
That's what I figured! 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:14:29
Yeah, if they were still $300...I'd agree with you.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:50:57
Bitcoin will never be publicly adopted. When the Bitcoin bubble bursts, dear Lord will it be a bloodbath.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:11:06
Oh, it'll go up. I have no doubt about that. Now is NOT the time to buy little bits though. If the ceiling is as high as everyone says, you need to have a wallet full to really cash in.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:56:17
That'll NEVER happen.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:32:19
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:31:08
That's certainly true. The problem is, there are tons of people in this sub that think it's going to make EVERYONE millionaires. It's not. NOW, is too late for that. Better than the market average right NOW, sure. But when it tanks, it's gonna tank hard.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:32:13
Dunno. I was about to pull the trigger, but the reality is, if you don't have at least A bitcoin, you're not getting rich off this shit. You had to get in early. Sure, you can ride the wave, but take for example, you put in $1,000 right now. And we go BEST case scenario which imho is a LONG shot, that each coin ends up being worth one million per. (Which will never happen) You're only worth 100,000. That's still awesome, but not what some of these other people in here where they'd be worth millions upon millions. 
I think all us late adopters are better off staying off this train, and jumping on one where you can actually make it rich if it pays off. Like Litecoin. It's currently a couple years behind bitcoin in trend, but is ultimately technically better than bitcoin. Not saying it will ever take btc over, or even reach the same levels, but there is a much LARGER chance of greater return on your money.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:05:05
The thing bitcoiners don't realize, is it's TOO LATE for people now. Sure, they can empty their savings account of that $1,000 into bitcoin, but to get an ROI like you guys are preaching will NEVER happen for them. You all got in when it was CENTS per bitcoin, or when it was FREE and anyone could mine them still. Or, worst yet...bought them at $100-300 range. Good for you. You got lucky.
If bitcoin made it to 100,000 a coin, which it won't, that investment would yield about $10,000. Now...that ROI isn't anything to shake a stick at, but that's assuming BEST case, the world went insane for bitcoin, which it won't, they are FAR from moon rides and lambos. The technology behind bitcoin is archaic in crytocurrency terms. BUY XRP FOR THE MARSRIDES!
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:58:45
You're an absolute moron. You're assuming something that JUST. WILL. NOT. HAPPEN.
The point of this whole argument is the money has already been made. From those who bought it when it wasn't worth anything. Anyone who would put in their life savings NOW... Thinking it was going up to 500k a coin, like you morons in here keep honestly telling people, would be devastated when they check back in a couple years and their money is all gone.
Don't worry, I'll be back to collect my fair share of salt. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:22:18
The point is, you are putting it in peoples head it could even GO that high. It can't. The fact that it hit 9k is ILLOGICAL. You got in at a good time. That's GREAT for you. The issue I have with this sub as a whole, is that it feeds misinformation to people thinking they are going to make millions NOW, buy putting their life savings into Bitcoin. That may be THE most irresponsible thing to do. Could they put in a couple hundred bucks, thinking they may double their money? Sure. I wouldn't steer someone away from that idea. But the circle jerking to noobs serves NOONE but those of you that already have a bunch of bitcoins. If those people don't buy into the hype, you guys end up with your dicks in your hands. Once people realize there are FAR better cryptocurrency out there, and by FAR better, I mean LIGHT YEARS ahead of Bitcoin, bitcoin fails.
It's simple. I just hope you guys know when to cut your losses when the inevitable happens.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:00:21
I'm already in the, financially ahead category. Got disposable income, pay everything with cash, no credit. Just built a 30k three car garage in cash. I'm good. I don't need 13k return in ten years. I want hundreds of thousands, a million. Other wise, there isn't enough skin in the game for me.
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:58:05
He's right though. A couple years too late for moonrides and lambos. Maybe a used corolla?
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:57:50
Totally. But really, who has 100k to invest, and into something like this??
Bitcoin is a house of cards. Technically speaking, it's like buying into betamax when Blu Ray are coming out.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:58:33
You think there will be a significant crash? It's too late to get in now, not at 8k a coin. I can only hope. I was one of those people even in 2016 who said man this is a scam. I still feel that way, but if I could buy them at $300, I'd do it knowing I could cash in again.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:19:34
How does one do that? I thought you had to buy a whole coin?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:09:06
That's great for you, most people will lose their shit.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:20:23
Oh, I get it. The more people scrambling to throw their hard earned money at Bitcoin, the more money you guys make propping up a shit cryptocurrency. Enjoy the ride, bitcoin ain't the crypto you should be hitching your investments into.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:47:17
You got lucky as fuck
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:54:05
More like 5k
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:03:04
Great. If you bought ONE coin, you made seven grand. Nothing to sneeze at, but with just that one coin, you're not retiring early like these guys who bought hundreds for a buck a piece bud. I'm not saying you can't make some money on it right now, but it's not going to make you Rich like the early lucky folk.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:39:05
Just ordered a trezor..
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:19:18
Enlighten me oh wise one.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:10:35
Well obviously, I'd be a millionaire right now. That doesn't change the fact that technically speaking, it is the worst of the major cryptos. It's current value is high, there's no argument about it. But the feds will take care of Bitcoin. If not, the people will. Once people learn what cryptocurrency actually is, they won't be investing into Bitcoin. Lol
Tons of people in here are telling people to spread the word on crypto, that's probably the WORST thing for Bitcoin that could ever happen. Once people do the research, they'll invest in things like LTC or if they are establishment types, XRP. Smart money goes into xrp.
