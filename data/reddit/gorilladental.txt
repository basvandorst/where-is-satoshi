We aren't even in the enthusiasm phase, yet. Less than 0.01 percent of adults have bought any. Long way to go. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:25:45
Absolutely agree. They've been great for the true Bitcoin and run a great exchange. Happy for their success.

It just makes sense to have a world currency and store of value that isn't tied to a specific country. 
Bitcoin will serve better as a currency once Lightning is added, but it's real strength now is as a deflationary store of value - something not even gold can match. 
It is also the basis of value and exchange for crypto similar to the way that oil is pegged to the dollar. It's gold 2.0++ and with a market cap of only 7 percent that of gold it seems there is much more room to grow. The Winklevi expect 10 - 20x from here. Beat that with 7 percent returns on stocks in a good year.

Wouldn't the "enthusiasm" phase involve more than .01 percent of adults invested in Bitcoin? I think we on Reddit tend to look inward more than outward to the rest of the world, sometimes. If one bankrupt country switches over to the most decentralized CryptoCurrency there is (Bitcoin) then you would at least have an argument that we're in the enthusiasm phase. Yet, not even most online retailers accept it. We're early. Step away from your screens.

Be sure to activate segwit on that ledger wallet and buy more Bitcoin from a reputable exchange that has segwit and tiniest fees

We aren't even in the enthusiasm phase. People know about it, yes. But, less that a tenth of a percent have actually bought any. Doesn't seem too enthusiastic, yet. Long way ahead. Lots of the best and brightest working on solutions. Decentralized like no other. Longest proven secure chain.

This is great for distribution, too. Instead of everything going to a few top bidders in an auction, it goes back in many smaller amounts to all of the early adopters that had it on mt. Gox

I put my hand upon your hip, when I dip, you dip, we dip
You put your hand upon my hip, when you dip, I dip, we dip
I put my hand upon your hip, when I dip, you dip, we dip
You put yours, and I put mine, and we can dip down low and roll and grind

"But as speculative dynamics disappear from the bitcoin market, the transactional benefits are likely to be the factor that will drive valuation." 
So, you're saying there's a chance!!!

Everything about the Chinese government is control. Monitor. Manage. I could see them copy crypto and implement their own government version of it someday. But, the sooner bitcoin and other cryptos disentangle from that mess the better in the long run.

Yep, I think this is the way that many typical investors will get in, at least at first. After they do more research (assuming they have time or interest), some will likely get their own wallets.
