We are doing it ourselves...why do you think we haven't launched yet ;)...but in all honesty it will take time for the arbitrage gap to close. That's why its best to be a part of our beta early when the gap will be most profitable.

The best way would be to get a bunch of their users asking them through emails and support about whether they accept bitcoin and how we can pay them in bitcoin...then also maybe have a service like BITPAY reach out to them and offer their service. If we make these game companies realize that bitcoins are just another revenue stream for them they will have no reason to not at least start accepting them through a service like bitpay, which turns the bitcoins into dollars automatically.
Another bonus would be the press these gaming companies would get. Anytime a new business announces accepting bitcoins the whole bitcoins news universe kicks out like a hundred articles about it.

first off we bear the risk of any funds lost on our platform, but like you said risk is inherent in any bitcoin venture. We of course won't be keeping all funds at all times at exchanges. Many of our funds will be kept in cold storage until needed. Also as you pointed out not all exchanges are created equal so we will only be using exchanges with a bit of history to them. We will also being distributing our funds to exchanges in varying amounts based on reliability and price at the particular exchange.

The passwords in that field will not actually be used to create your account. Once we go into open beta we will send out emails with information on how to create your account in our system.

none of the passwords will be used to create your account. Once our beta opens anyone who signed up will be sent an email with instructions on creating their first account.

Well if you want to be involved with many different crypto currencies you could invest in our site Crypto Street a [crypto currency exchange]( . We plan to launch in the next few days with crypto in and crypto out at first. We also plan to be US compliant very soon soo look out for that =)
Besides my own project another way to get involved long term is maybe looking into mining the younger alt coins. Such as feather coin and PPC. They all have the potential to grow in value and they are still relatively easy to mine. Litecoin a few months ago was basically being printed like candy and now its worth a few dollars each.
