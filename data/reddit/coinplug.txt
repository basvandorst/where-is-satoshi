The okBitcard won't be redeemed unless the cashier sells it. If someone steals the okBitcard from the convenient store, he won't be able to use it, because the okBitcard is not activated :)

Hey guys, this is Coinplug 
The Bitcoin giftcard(okBitcard) on the video is for distributing purpose. The actual cards look like this
[Click to see the photo](
But you will not be able to find the cards in 7-Eleven YET! We are in the process of distributing the cards to convenient stores.
However, anybody in Korea can buy bitcoins via 24,000 convenient stores in the form of receipt.

In order to buy, first you need to be in Korea :) then go to 7-Eleven and ask for the okBitcard. The cashier will print out a receipt that has the pincode, which you will redeem on the Coinplug's wallet app or web (
Once redeemed, you now have bitcoins :) all you need is a smart phone. No need for registration, bank transfer, trading, etc

For now, you can buy bitcoins via 7-Eleven in the form of a receipt.
Go to any 7-Eleven, ask for okBitcard (the cashier might not be familiar with the term: okBitcard, but it's there)
If the cashier can't find it, tell him or her to click "Service" -&gt; "Cashgate" -&gt; "okBitcard"
The cashier will print out the receipt that has the pincode on it :)
