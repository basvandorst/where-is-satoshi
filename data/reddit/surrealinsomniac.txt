This is great, but the fact that you have a missed call you haven't dealt with bothers me.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but a Bitcoin prohibition would be pretty much impossible to enforce, right? You could pass laws saying retailers and businesses can't accept it, and you could forbid coinbase from accepting USD; but with transactions being executed online and, if necessary, VPN's being pretty affordable, you couldn't effectively stop people in the US from buying, selling, trading, and hodling, right? Idk what the blackmarket scene would look like, but I imagine there is or would still be a way to sell for USD if you needed to.

Is that a Templar chest? It would be really cool if it was.

I mean, that might be the answer to my question right there.

I mean I didn't buy bitcoin because I'm young and very broke and that was honestly a tremendous mistake on my part I will admit that. Other things in my life did prevent me from even thinking about things like that at the time. 
I do get what you're saying, but that still doesn't account for the risk currently involved with BTC. I could definitely see at some point it being held as a new gold standard, but it seems like there's a lot of risk in the foreseeable future. It seems to me the responsible thing to have insurance. 
I guess what I would politely like to know is what makes people so very confident, because I've been lurking in this sub for a while and damn you guys are confident.

You know I don't own any bitcoin, but I completely agree and would gladly fight side by side with all of you for our rights to be upheld.

The more bitcoin rises, the more hysteria will set it, the more the US government will talk about banning it.

Well yeah if I had bought in years ago I would be very pleased. But most people don't see market crashes coming, and historically speaking they can be disastrous for people too heavily invested. Just looking for some insight into the thought process.

Best analogy in there is the drugs, let's avoid comparisons to things that actually should be banned. You're absolutely right though. I don't know too too much about all this, but would it even be possible for the government to fully ban Bitcoin?

Not a bitcoiner, but isn't there a principle in finance about diversifying assets? If you bet too heavily and it crashes you are fucked.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:59:07
That's very insightful, thank you. Is that not a vicious cycle though? According to that line of thought you could never withdraw heavily from your BTC without viewing it as a loss, so all you have is BTC. Not only does that make you vulnerable to market instability, but greatly limits your options.

Yeah that's what I'm saying, except crypto is acquired through the internet, so it would be even harder to stop than a physical commodity like gold. It's pointless.

I'm very interested in cyrptocurrency, especially the technology behind it. Didnt mean to offend, I am genuinely curious.

There's like a 64% chance Zuckerberg is one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.
