Dude, isn't it obvious?
Goldman is going to make a killing taking their commission on sales to institutional whales and then find ways to short the whole crypto sector on the way down.
This is textbook 2005-2008 Goldman and real estate.
Anyone looking to time the market just needs to watch Goldman. They are the baddest great white in the whole ocean.

I know foreign-born CEOs of much larger operations in Japan who aren't much better than him. Mastering keigo is hard, there's a reason Japanese companies make native applicants take keigo exams during the hiring process.

I wouldn't say that. Plenty of foreigners learn their Japanese conversationally first and develop bad habits. Not everyone studied keigo at a collegiate level for years. I wouldn't call it incompetence necessarily. Though to be fair most executives in Japan with less than strong keigo have native speakers (exec assistant) do their talking for them in formal meetings.

Think about what paypal accomplished in their first five years. Compare that to bitcoin today. It's not growing faster than paypal.

Transferwise is the actual answer.

Yeah Fidonet was an amazing community and protocol. I'd love to see a modern take on it.

Except it would kill reddit's ability to monetize via brand-safe advertising. That's the fundamental issue. Reddit has never figured out a way to generate profits at scale without advertising. That's the billion-dollar gorilla in the room keeping all these great ideas from being anything other than nice ideas.

BTW, I work as an executive headhunter in the tech industery. So a big benefit of my job is I get to have confidential interviews with the top brass who are creating all this tech.
The information advantage is massive and you don't want to be buying at a massive information disadvantage.
If you want to follow the smart money in crypto, keep an eye on Goldman. They are about to pump bitcoin to their institutional dumb money clients and then short it as soon as it's gonna pop. They did the same thing with the real estate bubble. That's the smart money to watch.

Can you give me two or three real world examples of technologies doing stuff "better" via blockchain? It all feels like hype to me and anyone touting it has skin in the game and a financial vested interest to tout it. It's multi-level marketing more than transformational tech, as far as I can tell.

I just don't see a trillion dollars worth of improvements coming from it, you know?
I'm old enough to remember stuff like the launch of Amazon.com, Google search... I saw VMware demo'd at Linux Con 1999 in New York. I remember seeing the ipod for the first time. The iphone launch. Hearing about AWS for the first time...
All of those were immediate "holy shit - this is going to be HUGE" moments for me.
I also remember hearing all about bitcoin back in 2010/2011 and thinking it was a cute hobby tech thing like "linux on the desktop." 
The big difference, for me, is because the key stakeholders stand to gain so much financially by contributing to the hype. So it's like the worst of the "linux on the desktop" crowd mixed with Multi-level Marketing.
And the linux on the desktop crowd were just in it for the nerdiness of it. This financial incentive to hype it/drink the kool-aid is a beast unto itself.

Thanks for answering my question honestly.


But the only benefit here from blockchain is a public ledger. Is that really the only advantage blockchain brings to the table? And public ledgers are already a thing (just an example: newsgroups posts are extremely difficult to spoof/remove and that tech has been around for 30+ years)


I'm still having trouble understanding how blockchain offers transformational benefit here. You can already easily keep a secure archive of your data/records on any one of the hundreds of redundant cloud providers or spin up your own personal cloud.
I guess that's my point. The best new companies happened because of developments in tech that allowed things that could have never existed before. (Think about what AWS did for the mobile gaming world - fully elastic capacity for when your app goes viral. Or VMWare/virtualization did for the data center - maximize server capacity to drastically lower real estate &amp; cooling costs.) 
Blockchain doesn't feel nearly transformational for me because I haven't seen the mind-blowing use cases yet.
I'm not writing it off, just saying it's way overhyped due to the nature of speculation/gambling.

Honestly, short of using an information network (which is way too cost prohibitive anyway) I would say two things.
1) Get a diverse and varied spread of news sources. The fake news phenomenon is absolutely real. Reddit is fantastic for the latest news but it skews male, young, American, nerdy and liberal. I read the entirety of The Economist every week which is the best concise source of global news I know. In tech The Information and TechInAsia are excellent as well. The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times are must reads as well if you want to follow the big boys too.
2) Understand where your passions and career intersect and what gives you an information advantage over others. I am sure, for example, there are great opportunities in biotechnology and real estate but I don't know those sectors well enough to make good decisions. That's why I stick to tech. Even a car mechanic is gonna know what car companies are doing before a banker will. That's an information advantage he could exploit if he's careful.
I follow the Warren Buffet method. Methodical thought followed by big confident bets maybe once a year, backed by good fundamentals, that you can hold at least until long term capital gains kicks in.
That's why I bought stuff in the past like Apple, VMware, Nvidia, and Nintendo.
Where I lost money is following hype. I remember taking a bath on Crocs and learning a lot. (No one making rubber sandals should spike like that)

More like 99% of crypto startups/ICOs, dude. The market is full of snake oil salesmen, much more so than traditional businesses.

I sold my bitcoin years ago and made a tidy profit. I think the market has been overvalued ever since it broke $900ish and the fundamentals don't make sense to own most cryptocurrencies. It's like day trading penny stocks on the pink sheets IMO.
I've made great gains on tech companies with solid fundamentals in the past few years. Saw NVIDIA go up over 300% (talk about transformational tech... Saw that coming a mile away!) and Nintendo has made up the bulk of my portfolio (up 200% in ther last 18 months as well).
You can still make good money investing in tech with good business fundamentals. But with crypto, as long as you understand you are trying to time a bubble and cash out before the real dumb money gets caught holding the bag, you'll do just fine.
I envy the ICO pump &amp; dumpers - those guys have balls of steel. I'm too old school to play that game but it's by far the most obvious cash grab in blockchain these days.

I think the vested interest that governments have in shutting it down makes it way too big a target for shut-down. It won't happen overnight, but look what happened to MegaUpload &amp; TPB.
