Talking about crypto will 100% get you laid
@_date: 2019-11-01 01:47:52
Yes you could

Idk why any one would do that. Maybe it's better with proof of burn then to send it to a random non used and not generated address since it in theory would increase the value because of lower supply, but it may as well just give bitcoin a worse reputation. Better to use bitcoins you wont use otherwise for something that's for sure good for bitcoin such as mining or just donating it to some developers

What? I can't believe bitcoin did this! I'm disappointed in btc now, and will now keep all my money in fiat and trust the government not to inflate it and trust the bank not to screw up either

Don't forget to only trade with borrowed money and to sell your kidney on the black market.

You could just make a texturepack so that lava is transparent and scan the qr code

Just more time to buy
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:34:50
I just did, I'm currently waiting for the transaction to confirm so that I can buy more with leverage
Reddit wouldn't let me  comment for 10 minutes so this comment is 10 minutes late

Are you trying to imply that btc is like pre-mined because it's not as popular as fiat yet and that there is not enough not yet mined btc so that every one that currently has no btc but has fiat can have have btc worth same as their fiat compared to current btc holders' btc?  
So every btc holder is supposed to burn their btc so that every one can mine and have equal chance from now on to have a certain amount of btc?
