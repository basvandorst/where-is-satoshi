Umm where is the proof that this is money laundering related?  Also a completely open blockchain is a terrible tool for money laundering.  There are much better options.

Bingo, OP seems confused.  Its not about the inability to convert to other currencies (and out of RMB), its about being able to protect assets and send them "overseas" (or onto the blockchain) where its easier to protect wealth and keep it out of the reach of the Chinese government.  Its the same reason Chinese have bought up so much real estate in the US where there are much better protections of private property, etc.
But definitely some good points OP.

The problem is your knowledge is too limited.  You don't seem to be aware that Chinese citizens are limited to moving 50k USD out of the country per year.  So yes, they may let you open a foreign bank account, but if you put in over 50k in one year, they can punish you.  Yes, they may not stop you right away, but if you get caught later you can get punished.  Because bitcoin is so much easier to hide than a bank account, it is a very effective method of circumventing the capital controls.  Do you see now?
