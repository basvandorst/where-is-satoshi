That wasn't even close to the real dip, but the smartest thing to do is keep buying an affordable amount regardless the price.

I don't know if this site is legit but they sell Zimbabwe and Venezuela's bills.

You can always sell me your cheap bitcoins.

Yeah, I want Bitcoin to raise and become a powerful tool, but I want it to be in a respectable and transparent way, not by hiding every bad thing that happens just like banks have been doing since their creations.

LocalBitcoins supports SegWit? Good shit!

I started at $300 but was too young to afford a good amount so I stopped and sold almost all of them, when I wanted back I thought I was too late everytime it jumped its price. Joined back at $8500 and I'm not planning to stop unless I need money.

Hilarious considering Venezuela's currency is also backed up by oil, see how that turned out.

My plan is to just buy constantly except when it goes down in which I buy a good amount.

Reminds me of the Walter White's situation.
Part-Owner of a growing company, sold his stock for $5k to pay a few months of rent and the company was worth billions of dollars some years later.

Unless you are going to move to an available country yeah.

You can just move it to a cold storage like, once a month?  $30 in fees/month isn't very relevant unless your investment is below 4 digits.

Since October I started tracking every purchase I've made and the prices to be able to calculate the profit I've made so far in my hot storage, it could drop to a negative number and I wouldn't mind at all, I believe in the BTC as a long term currency.
