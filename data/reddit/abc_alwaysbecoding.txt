Ugh, do we really want to go there, lol. I'm a heavy sympathizer, put it that way. I believe that if there is a question *at all* as to whether something should be controlled or regulated, the answer is "no" (so that only things that will clearly benefit from regulation, get regulated). I believe that if there is a question as to whether something consensual should be banned, the answer is always "no." I am very anti-authoritarian. I just have doubts about public services in a libertarian universe.
The best thing the libertarians could ever do would be to fund a movie that plausibly depicts a libertarian society, with as much of the consequences of it thought-out as possible.

[This is what happened when more than one police force was created for the same area.](

Public schools and compulsory education fed by school taxes? I'm onboard with abolishing that, just about. I think we teach kids all wrong.
Drug decriminalization? I'm onboard with that too.
Corporate versions of water, sewer, power, roads, and other infrastructure? I don't think that would work very well. Quality would vary too widely.
And finally, the doozy- Healthcare. We are already seeing when a for-profit healthcare insurance company confronts actual healthcare needs- why ensure someone voluntarily who would almost definitely be a financial loss for the insurer? Sorry, that WILL NOT WORK. PERIOD. We *cannot* expect insurers to just insure you out of the kindness of their coffers, as it were. There is just zero incentive there (other than a certain human sensitivity). It thus takes laws (and perhaps taxes) to ensure these folks get insured, as it were. If you would just leave the sick and uninsured to rot in their sickness, then you're just a cruel and inhumane individual and do not represent the best ideals of our species. (Not only that, such a person cannot even be productive, effectively taking them out of the "voluntary exchange" loop)

sorry, but money is not a reason to kill yourself. find work that doesn't kill you (preferably something you love) and you'll be fine while contributing to society. If he killed himself over BTC it's likely he would have suffered from depression anyway.
If "not making millions" is a reason to kill yourself then we should all just jump off a bridge right now, posthaste.
I got into Bitcoin because it was geeky, not because I wanted to make money. I mined 3,000 BTC in 2012-2013; I sold the vast majority of it prior to the price reaching $1000 in order to diversify into real estate (which ended up making NO money). I did OK, but yeah, damn. Wish I had kept them all.
There was a guy I bought off of in those days; he looked like a drug user. I always felt bad buying them off of him, but now I wonder if he's your brother (or at least, the same type). I'm sorry.
If I had not bought FPGA (and later ASIC) miners from Butterfly Labs and had bought BTC outright instead, I would have had at least 8,000 BTC.

That is a lovely ideal, but in practice people have agendas, and given the flexibility that wording has, how you word things (see: the entire history of Fox News) can bend argument one way or the other (let's call it "the fruit") even if the seed is truth, and for this reason, one's biases should be voluntarily disclaimer'd.

The **problem** is that anyone rational who knows this information **would not even try those drugs.** If they **still** choose to try them to the point of physical dependency, then it is a medical problem that should be treated like any other medical problem, just like any legal addiction like MMORPG addiction, prescription painkiller addiction or whatever. Also, not everyone becomes dependent, it varies by person.


Unfortunately that is impossible, as brain receptor hyperstimulation (as with any neuronal overstimulation) results in adaptation and once you have adapted, withdrawal results in... symptoms, as your body struggles to head back to the new equilibrium.


Sure. One nice thing about drug legalization is that *it enables anyone to actually study them.*


And when the government finally goes sour, *as every government in all of human history has,* this will be the perfect opportunity for them to consolidate their power base, confiscate all registered weapons and commit any atrocity that they wish to, like a metastasized cancer in a crippled immune system. Seriously, have you ever heard of a government that simply stepped down peacefully? If there was ever such a thing, it is the exception, not the rule.
Not to mention, this control has the same problem as all controls, which is that only the law-abiding obey the controls. The non-law-abiding could give a flying fuck and will just 3D-print their weapons in the future. In fact, there would be a gigantic profit to be made due to the illegality. Which unfairly penalizes high-risk-tolerant individuals, because those odds are attractive to them.


That's fine. You're law-abiding and apparently, not very curious about the world and not much of a risk-taker. :P There are many, many people who are not, however. Plenty of people who have tried, said "ok, not for me," and moved on.


Here's the funny thing- if they were legal there WOULD be PLENTY of quality control!


I just killed this argument. Legalization would enable quality control, just like legalization of prostitution would enable STD certification, labor laws being able to enter the prostitution world, prostitutes able to report abuse by pimps or clients to the police, etc. etc.


You're so special. :P I don't do drugs on any kind of a regular basis (unless you count caffeine, alcohol and OTC drugs), but I am pretty sure that 1/3 of the people I know smoke pot semi-regularly or more. Plenty of them drink plenty of alcohol. I went to Cornell (and I'm also a USAF veteran), I know some fairly classy people, and this still holds. I don't judge, and I don't ask. On occasion, I've puffed and passed. :P
Last argument- If we really based the law on what was actually addictive, nicotine, caffeine and alcohol would be even more regulated. Fortunately, the first 2 don't really have serious side effects (nicotine on its own is not that much of a carcinogen, it's the tars which are the main problem there), alcohol on the other hand...

Entrapment is making something illegal and dangerous that should be neither illegal nor dangerous, waiting around until someone makes it less-dangerous by putting it online, and then threatening them with said [provably misguided law]( while pretending to be a snitch. /s
Suppose being gay was still illegal with drastic punishment, and I was law enforcement and suspected you were acting gay. Suppose you weren't just gay, you were like a gay Jesus figure in the gay community, making being gay safer by offering free condoms, etc... As law enforcement, I'd go to a gay bar pretending to be gay (which is lying, basically), catch you in a gay act, and then threaten to ruin you by outing you, then I'd have my buddy come in and offer to "silence" me... for a fee.
And all the while, being gay shouldn't have been fucking illegal in the first place.
Does that sound fucking fair to you? Because it sure doesn't sound fucking fair to me. It sounds like fucking entrapment... no matter what the actual definition is.

[It must.](
That article is a few years old, but basically, it depends on the number of Bitcoin transactions occurring, because if it did not have a value, then it literally couldn't carry the value necessary to perform the transactions it's being used for.
Even more simply, the only way Bitcoin could go to zero again is if all trade using it stops (or if it's somehow fatally cracked, but that's unlikely and outside this discussion).
If you think about it, this makes sense.
What Buffett fails to understand (yes, billionaires can be wrong or ignorant) is that the "basic" value of a Bitcoin DOES have a minimum, though, and is based on its trade velocity.

[Drugs should be legalized because human adults should be personally responsible for their own bodies, and shouldn't need babysitters. Debate here.]( You're better off treating it as a public health problem (same as prostitution, etc.) instead of criminalizing it.
[There are many links to the positive results of Portugal's drug decriminalization changes.]( The evidence is there... Why are we waiting to change based on it?
Anyone can make an untraceable weapon, there's a million guides on the Internet, and soon ([if not already]( you will be able to print them, making the entire question of "should weapons be untraceable?" moot. Not only that, [we have at least one example from history where an unjust confiscation of all registered weapons occurred, with rather dire consequences.]( I actually have mixed feelings on gun control, there are strong arguments for both sides, and there are also individual debates depending on the type of weapon. I actually think we need to invent a cheap, safe way to incapacitate someone at a distance, for some short period of time (tasers are not good enough). Maybe like an electronic flashbang grenade...
The fact that fake ID's are still even possible is only because [the ones in charge are still too stupid to realize that 30-year-old public key cryptography technology can make un-counterfeit-able ID's]( This is the same technology that makes Bitcoins uncounterfeitable.

The only information you can trust is what you see with your own eyes and not what people tell you. If, based on what you understand about it, you think Bitcoin is a cool as hell, original idea that can do some overall-good in the world (and perhaps have the side effect of increasing the value of bitcoins), then get involved (which may take many forms including buying them, mining, trying to build services with bitcoin etc.), because it's probably a reasonably good educated risk at that point.
If not, then don't.
I made a bunch of money mining. I would have made 4 times the amount if I had just bought them outright. Do I sweat it? Nah, because I'm a nerd who loves nerdy shit and that's where the real value comes from in my eyes. But everyone else's eyes are different and important.

You should only need to integration-test with Coinbase directly, VERY infrequently. In your day to day unit test suite you should be stubbing out calls to Coinbase and returning deterministic responses (that would hopefully mirror Coinbase's actual behavior... the validation of that, ON OCCASION, is what your separate, integration test suite is for). For Ruby there's a gem called [VCR]( which basically replays HTTP responses in a test suite, optionally re-validating them every so often.
Only test the code you control, day-to-day. If your code breaks because of someone else's API endpoint behavior change, then that's not really your code's fault (although it still needs to be fixed, obviously). Interfaces between components should rarely change, however.

Do you really think that 100 years from now, anyone is going to give a shit about what 2015'ers called "terrorists"? Hell they might *even* say that the mass killing of Muslims by remote Predator drone bombing was a wasted opportunity to promote mutual growth *at best* (and a "solution via homicidal mania with lasting repercussions" *at worst*). This is not ISIS sympathy, this is simply *not being an insensitive human asshole.* Hopefully we will have all moved beyond all these bullshit distinctions by then, as well as the "religious thinking."
You're woefully misguided if you think that we're not creating more "terrorists" by our policies of "carpet-bomb now and ask questions later". If your argument is that "they" don't give us the same courtesy, I could argue that either they are rational humans who have reasons to be motivated to harm Western entities which are grievances which should be aired, OR that "problem solution by erasure" is not a valid long-term solution. I will not accept the hypothesis that every ISIS person is a certifiably insane individual driven by irrational hatred. (I WOULD say that "religious thinking" is a factor, however.

I think there is a difference between information that should be private and information that is publicly available. I think this is a case of apples and oranges.
There's a qualifier that if some private information becomes available everywhere, it's useless to stop it so it is effectively public information- see, for example, Kim Kardashian shitty-sex tape, or the Ashley Madison data.
Bitcoin is not rocket science, and ALL of its information is available publicly. If I give a terrorist instructions to build a bomb that are also googleable with some minimal effort, do I *really* deserve to be thrown into prison for 11 years? Especially if I'm a young dumb impressionable kid who has not developed any critical thinking skills whatsoever yet and therefore has a high potential of being seduced by radical ideas without realizing the potentially severe consequences?
The part of 18 U.S. Code S 2339B that was apparently violated was "Whoever knowingly provides material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization, or attempts or conspires to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned"...
Showing someone Google search results is apparently providing "material support," which I think is an *extremely* broad definition at best, and a bullshit asinine interpretation at worst.

In this case, who says Apple has to comply with *all future requests of increasing complexity* just because they complied with this one?

It makes it weaker to brute-force.
The physical analogy I can come up with would be for the government to be asking, "instead of making every phone an impenetrable fortress, make it like a very strong safe that could be theoretically drilled through, given enough time/expense/effort." This is literally equivalent to the kind of physical security we have now, which seems to have worked OK for hundreds of years.
Of course a counterargument could be made that adding *any* weakness instantly makes more secure alternatives more valuable.

Surely you've [watched some of the hundreds of people on youtube talking about their observed experiences]( (all in concordance on quite a few details and many of which observed things that were impossible to know in their flatlined state?) and are basing your assessment off of that? Otherwise, you are frankly full of shit right here, sticking your head in the sand. They not only would swear up and down that that is what they observed, they often remark "it was realer than what we know of as 'real'."


I also can't prove to you that I'm not a virgin; that doesn't mean I am. I also can't prove love exists; that doesn't mean it doesn't.


No, magic does not exist. Irrational things do exist however. For example, how do you objectively assess the value of the Mona Lisa? The answer is that you can't, because the price of the Mona Lisa is the highest price that someone would pay based on their *subjective, irrational* evaluation of the value. There is no "Mona Lisa proof" that scientifically shows it to be worth some amount in some currency... you'd always end up needing a human observer/assessor at some point in the process... which is circular reasoning. So, rationality and materialism simply can't explain everything *already*.


Demonstrably false. Your assumption that everything is materialist and deterministic is wishful thinking (and not an optimistic kind, either... it inevitably leads to nihilism).

The drug trade is a consensual one. And without regulation, it's a dangerous one. And without legality, it's a risky one. Despite every measure trying to stop it, and despite all the dangers and risks, *it still exists.* It's time to just legalize it and regulate the shit out of it. It's amazing that we went through all this with Prohibition generations ago, and we still don't fucking get it.
Silk Road made things safer, at least. [Here's an article with a link to a research paper.]( So it's entirely possible that (with all due irony), *Ross Ulbricht may have saved lives.* Read the paper and think about that for a minute- He's in jail for saving lives by making an illegal market safer to operate in. Since the trade was going to happen anyway, you see. Since it is apparently unstoppable.

This is an assertion without evidence.


I never actually bought from them, but yeah I was a bitcoin early adopter. Also, I [linked to a paper which, via the miracle of science and data, **proved that it was safer.**]( You can't counteract evidence by merely stating it's false, lol, you must have counterevidence. Or attack the methodology or the way the data was collected or whatever. What you **can't** do, *in a rational discussion,* is insinuate that the claim is "false" by putting "safer" in "quotes."
Now, to be entirely fair, there were objections to that paper, but they strove to be rational. I see nothing of the sort here. Up the bar, man!


This is bullshit. Silk Road had a rating system and showed reviews by unique usernames. People's reputations were attached to their pseudonyms/usernames. People with more good reviews over time and whose accounts existed longer could therefore charge more. The same exact system Reddit uses with usernames and karma. For example, I can click on your username right now and get a gauge of what you're about and see that you have 1/3 the karma I do, which debatably says something about the "cred" one should attach to either of our statements here lol 
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:51:16
If you don't think eyewitness evidence is evidence, you can take it up with the courts, all of whom recognize it (actually, they [overrate it]( and some reform is needed there, but that doesn't mean it's not evidence).
Do you have an actual counterargument that is not simply a statement of refutation? Perhaps some evidence, or at least a rational argument other than the [proof by assertion fallacy]( to support your position that eyewitness testimony is not "scientific facts"?

Are you fucking serious? If I lose my virginity and can't prove it to anyone, it didn't happen? You're really reaching, here, to justify your worldview.


None of these people, if you actually bothered to read about or watch some of these accounts, described their experience as in any way dreamlike. In fact, "realer than real" is the most common description.


Unless you experience it yourself, or someone you trust has. Or if hundreds of people you don't trust have, if you've read all their accounts, and realize the common elements are statistically-significant. Which I have.


If someone ever believes they actually met Santa Claus, then Santa Claus is real to them. If they then try to tell you Santa is real, and you don't believe it... That's on you. If a hundred or a thousand people try to tell you Santa Claus is real, if you still have no doubt in your mind that they are all full of shit, just because you can't conceive of a way that Santa Claus is possible, then you're severely limiting yourself, that's all I can say.


[Is that so?]( (lol)


You're literally using an appeal to emotion/ad-hominem fallacy here WHILE SUGGESTING *I'M* THE IRRATIONAL ONE. Classy.


Free will is IMHO a prerequisite for any continued existence of consciousness (otherwise, what's the point, anyway? we're just a way for the uncaring universe to divert into low entropy on its inevitable march to infinite entropy?) and that would mean living behavior is not ultimately deterministic.
P.S. Santa IS real... he exists in people's hearts. :P

People also reported [meteoroids]( for hundreds of years, and were made fun of for pretty much that entire time... until we one day realized that not only were they real, but also from space!! And in that case, there was even solid evidence, and STILL people did not believe the stories about "rocks falling from the sky, that's absolutely preposterous!".
So, yeah. That happened.
People were also called out for denying [the aether]( existed, despite all observable evidence pointing to the lack of existence of one.
[Scurvy]( killed millions of people during a time when it was already known that citrus fruit would ward it off, partly because people simply did not believe that such a simple solution would work.

@_date: 2016-09-09 17:29:27


Fair enough- this is "survivorship bias". But do people die every time a drug is taken? I think not. Let's assume that the 100th hit of heroin on average will do you in. That means you can post 99 good reviews of some heroin seller before you cease to exist and complain. :P I'm assuming here that a "bad batch" won't always kill you, of course. Wouldn't exactly be good long-term business to kill off your customers, now, would it?


Sometimes, this technique just "smells bad"- the writing style looks too similar, the positive reviews were all posted around the same time or otherwise arouse suspicion. Also, this doesn't explain any negative reviews which would ostensibly also be posted and cannot be stopped- this is the reason why Amazon, for example, lists both positive and negative reviews even on highly-reviewed products.


You lose ALL the reputation you had up to that point and you will be forced to lower costs or otherwise mitigate the risk of a new seller with no reputation. Ever try to sell something legit on eBay with a new account? Good fucking luck.


While your criticism works on Reddit, I don't think reviews of drug shops count as an "echo chamber".


No, not just that- you've clearly never met someone in person you never met before to do a deal of anything, even legal things... there's additional risk of theft, stabbing, being held up or shot... it's a confrontation. WHICH IS EXACTLY, FOR THE THIRD TIME I'M SAYING THIS, WHAT THE ARTICLE I POSTED STATED.


Yes they [fucking do, according to some of the fucking evidence]( You CANNOT simply claim they don't, out of your ass.

That explanation might work for you but none of the (dozens? hundreds?) of accounts I've read or watched were in any way, shape or form, comparable to the Phosphene phenomenon.
The problem is that unless you are genuinely curious about NDE's, you won't bother to read or watch those accounts, and your flawed uninformed worldview will thus remain intact and unthreatened, just as your insecure ego prefers. (Not just you... Many people.) And so this discussion ends up being like a trial where only the defense has heard all the evidence and the prosecution thinks it doesn't need to even see the evidence because it must be preposterous.

Not sure if you're out of touch, since you've probably been quite busy playing startup CEO, but just to reel you back into the fold a bit...
A year ago I was a huge fan. I literally did many thousands of dollars of business with you, having mined most of my coins between 2011-2014.
This year is an ENTIRELY different story. I can't seem to buy a single bitcoin from you (yes, I tried 4, then 3, then 2, THEN ONE) without the Spanish Inquisition treatment (followed by a rejection of the transaction, *days later!*) My account has had full verification for years now.
I understand that this is all part of AMLKYC compliance, but this does not make it any less onerous, especially considering that Bitcoin itself takes a Honey Badger approach to all this (and this is why the community likes it). And ESPECIALLY given how much business I've done with you in the past. (Seriously. Possibly a hundred thousand fiat dollars or more. PM me for details.)
Lastly, "guilty until proven innocent" is a really shitty way to run a government OR a company. And this philosophy is of course what AMLKYC is based on, all in the name of risk mitigation. But Bitcoin folks despise it, of course. (They're not a risk-averse, authority-respecting sort.)
How about trying a new, radical form of risk mitigation- Trusting your regular customers!
Anyway, despite being a pioneer, your company's extremely strict behavior *of late* has been a HUGE turnoff. It was bad enough that you insisted on private key custody early on (which seems to have been a good decision, *for now,* given all the security issues out there currently).
Hope this is not a shocker. Did you expect NO backlash by going the route you did? There's a reason why one of the April Fools' jokes I saw was "Ben Lawsky joins Coinbase." Because it's entirely plausible.

Well, I AM being honest. They DID email me back in August of last year asking a whole bunch of questions (see: Spanish Inquisition treatment), and I never saw that email as it got de-prioritized by Gmail, but even after I answered all the questions in that email (a few months ago) after a customer support request I made, they have still not allowed purchases by me, of any amount. Maybe NOT answering that email flagged me?? If so, that would be ridiculous, and just further prove my point. I am possibly THE most honest person out there, in this space. I'm a good player, and always have been.

And so I threw kind of a buttload of money at it in early 2012, which was especially crazy because it was my nest-egg and I was in between jobs (although to be honest I had JUST gotten an offer).

The first question back would be, *relative to what?* It's been double where it is now. Relative to its future potential? It might be a steal right now.
If the US Government ever falls (like every government in history has) or the USD ever "trips" (or, say, China dumps its 3 billion USD in reserve on the market all at once to wage economic war), then bitcoin will still be around. In fact, if any world currency falls *at all* (hint: the USD is probably the world's most stable, due to its hegemony, so it's a poor point of comparison), it is extremely likely to gain as a result. It will be around until the Internet falls... My money's on the latter outlasting the former I guess lol
I think that it's sensible for most to own a few, just as a hedge if for no other reason.
But yeah... if you hold a lot of Bitcoin... I also think it's sensible to sell off (I'm sorry, *trade for antiquated pieces of paper that we believe hold value* haha) a few blocks of coins right now, just in case a bus takes out Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn and whatnot.

First undercover cop: "Hi, I just made wearing red shirts punishable with life in prison, and I am threatening to go to the authorities with my photographic evidence that you wore a red shirt"
Second undercover cop: "Hi, I could get rid of that problem for you for some cash, no life in prison, I'd just make it go away, and what's so wrong about wearing a red shirt anyway?"
Do you see the problem yet? Aside from it being entrapment pure and simple. It's exactly the same as if I put you under arrest for resisting a wrongful arrest! Circular reasoning. "It's illegal and dangerous because we made it illegal and dangerous (and not due to actual evidence of its actual danger)"
You're assuming all laws are just and fair. This guy arguably made the drug trade (which is going to keep happening ANYWAY despite ANY amount of illegality) safer for thousands of people. And someone comes along and threatens to expose you putting you in prison for life? What would you resort to? Would you just say "ah fuck it, the jig is up, here, cuff me"?

Its use would have to go down to zero miners (meaning its utility would have to be ENTIRELY supplanted by something else which is better... likely another cryptocurrency... do you see yet where this is going), OR the internet would have to die, for it to die.
So... Assuming that bitcoin, or some other cryptocurrency which entirely supplants its use (and by the way that would be a gradual process, it wouldn't happen all at once), is likely to continue to exist in some form... Which would you put money on lasting longer, Australia or The Internet?

Seriously, they're fucking stupid and nearsighted, but I probably have them to thank, at least in part, for this uptick. [Smell you later, rubble!]( If Russia was smart, they'd realize that cryptocurrencies are a hedge against USD "international de facto currency" hegemony. I mean, Putin is not exactly *in love* with the U.S., right now, right?
This might even make the U.S. a bit friendlier towards The Coin. "If Russia's doing it... we're not going to follow them."
A day will come when some country's fiat will collapse and will be absorbed by crypto/gold/phone cards/buying foreign goods or real estate/whatever else is available that appears to hold value better than the fiat, as it falls. It will happen suddenly, like a bank rush, and at that point, you'll know what's up.

(EDIT: You're right, the negative fee should just be built into the exchange rate, which is based on a belief of where the currencies are going.) That is also where value comes from (belief). And lastly, this is how bitcoin is going to succeed... via a series of imperfectly-managed state currencies, because Bitcoin is the ultimate "fuck you" to shite currency controls, and will sllluuuuurp up their value if they underperform Bitcoin.

Wow... Can you imagine the topsy-turvy world if this came true?
This is also the first time in the history of the world that currencies will compete with each other directly *based on the features of the currency itself*. (Cryptocurrencies are already to some extent competing with *each other* based on this.) Prior to this, it was basically "slow heavy gold vs. every other slow paper fiat currency" and they were traded based on the belief in the economies that used those currencies, as reflected in the value of the currency *only as measured against other equally slow fiat currencies* and not against the utility of the currency itself.
But now we have something which is impossible to counterfeit, impossible to tamper with or regulate, to issue or recall by centralized decree, and for all intents and purposes, impossible to kill.

\* You can replace "censorship" with "over-regulation" or "DRM" or "guilty until proven innocent" in this case.
Since Bitcoin is Net-native, it is performing the same function, essentially.
I'm sick and tired of "good actors" having to endure this sort of shit. I had my own main bank account locked up for an entire month due to completely-legal Bitcoin dealings.

In a sense, it's already been started. It's called "The Internet".
And it's already got a native currency (Bitcoin).
It has its own media (Reddit etc.) and its own opinion. It is a community.
It collects taxes (Internet fees), although those are still in the non-native fiat currency.
It has dual citizenship (you authenticate to the Internet via things like Facebook; you authenticate to the physical state via a difficult-to-confiscate ID or passport).
Does it have decentralized governance?

I tried to buy 8 bitcoins. They rejected the trade.  
Then I went to 4, 2, 1.  
They fucking rejected a purchase of *one bitcoin.*
All the money is traceable. It's connected to a bank with completely traceable cash in the old monetary system. It's not like I showed up with a pile of Benjamins and was trying to buy Bitcoins to "launder" them.
And that's when I told them I'm sorry, but whoever is making them do so for a guy who has done business with them for years can fuck off. I refuse to be guilty until proven innocent.
