Thank you so much. You are an idol of selflessness. I wish you the happiest future!

What if you want to return the item? Probably not easy, is it?

Everyone's concerns so far are pretty silly, it takes 1 second to generate a new deposit address, it's 7 questions long to takes less than 1 minute to answer. Everyone should have a VPN anyways so that's to their detriment if they don't. 
However I will say for research for a university dissertation there is generally a pretty high standard for having a disclosure and privacy consent page before the survey.
In addition, the biggest flaw is that someone has a high incentive to submit multiple responses to increase their chances of winning and therefore any conclusions drawn from this survey are totally invalid.

LOL, what did the bitcoin blockchain even have anything to do with that? It seemed like such an odd thing for him to say. Can anyone explain how it was relevant?

I hear you, my friend!

Lol just as I withdraw all cash from Bitfinex before they stop trading in USA, by buying up the rallying BTC, it tanks. Should have checked Reddit first! Just another day as a BTC trader.

There's no fee for receiving an Amazon gift code, which was an awesome change. They still short change me on my count though, I have tested it a couple of times.

So how does Wirex make money if they don't charge a "fee"?
This seems too good to be true...

Has it been down a lot the past few days? My Coinbase app (Android) has been giving me lots of errors.
Also: Obligatory "I sold at 2800" humblebrag

Better 2800 to 2400 than 10k to 2400. Smaller corrections give me comfort

The steak sandwich at Room 77 was possibly the best burger I've ever had. Amazing! (I think they only make it on Fridays and Saturdays though)

Ah well I figured it out. They don't charge transaction fees but there are other ones.
$1 (or Euro or GBP) per month per card
$17 card issuance fee
Foreign transaction fees around 2.5% (competitive)
ATM fees (around $2.50, way better than the usual $5)
Unfortunately the deal breaker is that they don't support customers in the USA. DARN!
