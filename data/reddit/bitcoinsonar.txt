Interesting talk, provided it's from 2009.  
! He cites 'Tesla'(elon musk) and says that Tesla is decentralized. I didn't know they started with strong decentralization.

How much sales revenue in Bitcoin after one month, and how much per month after one year?
What impact on BTC price?

Her video sounds like a wake-up call i'd say, something like: "if bitcoin doesn't adapt it will die, for real this time, because it doesn't serve the market the best". I know one new answer he see here and there is: "bitcoin is in fact not made for transactions" which is quite weird.

Good news for the 51%attacks network security. This makes the required hash rate for 51% attack &gt;500 PetaH/s from current insiders pools, which is gigantic. For a government or organization to perform this would require to get &gt;1000petah/s since they would start from scratch and from the outside. If they were to use all supercomputers in the world, it would not be sufficient, since they aren't btc-asics (1 Ghash/s &lt;=&gt; 12,700 Gflop/s).  
BUT I don't remember how many billions it would take to get a 1GH/s mining farm and perform the attack (yes I should google it). Maybe just 2 or 3? or more? The question being: who could want to lose x billions.

A significant percentage of the 15millions coins are already lost forever, and over time more and more will be. So at some point either you add one more decimal digit after the current 8 (1satoshi --&gt; 0.1 satoshi), or you raise the supply limit, or bitcoin kinda ends b/c not practical systemically -- but we are far from this point where such a change will be needed (maybe in ten years? maybe only if bitcoin has massive success).  
Besides, making those changes would just require the miners to take the decision according to their interests.

ok I've been fooled by the numbers: CNY represents 96,5% because there aren't trading fees on (most/all) chinese exchanges so coins can freely go frenetically "back and forth" (here also mentioned "wash trading" --market manipulation in which an investor simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments--; and users with bots/ suggested by plus the speculative possibility of intentionally faked numbers.
edit: cryptocompare should maybe correct this on their website because it might fool most people.
edit2: BUT THEN,  
1. what are the actual numbers, where does the "more realistic" Liquidity Base of trading volumes of the CNY traders, where does it stands compared to the rest, e.g. USD and EUR? --and who owns what percent of CNY liquidity ---chinese, us citizens, etc.--  
2. And, the question of the post here remains: what would that mean for bitcoin, i.e. would that be concerning, for whom, for the future of bitcoin, and why.

The two places with biggest volume are HUOBI (24H volume = Ƀ 1,421,764.06) and OkCoin (24H volume = Ƀ 811,748.63 ). So are they related to your statement? --1million bitcoin daily volume seems indeed quite "huge" but not impossible--
@_date: 2016-02-25 22:15:35
the volume I'm quoting is the volume in Bitcoin as stated on cryptocompare (their graph is in btc), so I can't see how the value of CNY/USD relates to the Btc volume here.

so, 1 in a million.. until the consensus decides to raise the code-limited 21M limit, somewhere in the far future (2050?), if bitcoin succeeds, at least gavin said so somewhere on his blog --at least it is not impossible--. because, coins get lost and, 2,1.10^15 token units might still be insufficent for liquidity let say if suddenly the population of humans in the solar system is multiplied by a factor of 100 (because everyone is immortal) and those 900 billions humans are all "rich" because of transhumanism, radical abundance, the "singularity" paradigm and stuff. Although, indeed, bitcoin liquidity can (and will) be infinitely multiplied with sidechains, so raising the limit may probably not be required.
! I am of course not an advocate of raising the limit. thanks

I'd bet on application niche cryptos, created by companies or community for specific uses, but not if the architecture is "centralized" flawed like Steem. Just look at charts and they will tell you at least what is not a good altcoin. Nowadays, there also is an impressive wave of crazy pump-coins, and they all seem to happen since end august for unknown reason, and the cap is flowing from one mega-dump to one-overnight-super-pump: monero to SDC to foldingcoins and back to NAV and BBR and so on: rotation pump-dump is happening.   
But one thing remains certain: the money generally comes back to bitcoin since traders are selling x altcoin to bitcoin for switching between altcoins: the more the merrier I would say.   
Altcoins are good for bitcoin.  
edit: my top 5:  
1. ETH or ETC(programming)  
2. XMR for the hype/niche_value  
3. ripple/factom/the like for certain banks / value of service  
4. dash, since it has been around and they are really obsessed  
5. the bitfinex token cause that was/is quite funny

Bitcoin is solid, but there are competitors for lots of different uses. For example monero has %replaced btc on certain markets. Then you have certain banks and companies that will use somehow-proprietary (but still open) "blockchains", the best example being Ripple, for the purpose of unifying the ledger/transaction intra-and-interbank system - why they don't just use bitcoin I don't know. And there is a % of ripples that are available to public for "decentralized/independent" use to buy, hold, use. Factom is quite similar although a bit more ethereum-like. So then there are application specific tokens and frameworks like ethereum, also providing a currency, so at the code level the txs are made in ether where systems are built with ethereum.
Then some specific use or even companies token; like: synereo for their social network, like: steem for their blog platform; like: bitcrystals for their trading cards mtg-like game and in-game token txs.
There is a lot of niches.   
Currently it is mostly good for bitcoin since bitcoin is generally used as *the inter-coins and reserve currency* for most of those systems and currencies. To become irrelevant, bitcoin would have to be replaced by something that would do better its current function especially the *inter-coin+reserve functions*. And that could be ripple, but unlikely. One thing remains certain is how bitcoin has become less volatile.  
So to answer your question, I'd say the more you dive into the cryptocurrencies world and the more pragmatic you get about bitcoin, the more you hope the miners are gonna accept upgrade that don't seem their best interest short-term and that a fee market is gonna be implemented and you are a bit concerned about the delay of update of the code - and you become bipolar because you know that on the other side, a slow and very secure update mecanism provides for an extremely good security which makes bitcoin's first function which are solidity and immutability (unlike eg ETH).
edit: uh oh downvotes: I forgot I was on r/bitcoin .  but still, Mike Hearn has done much much much more for bitcoin than 99% or more of the people answering this thread. now you can downvote.
@_date: 2016-09-21 21:51:52
Factom and Counterparty, systems that rely on Bitcoin, if successful, might help btc to become more solid. I have the feeling if bitcoin-layered systems and apps don't happen, bitcoin wont happen. But I am confident it as a 50/50 chance. And there will be competitors with corresponding cap value.
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:35:40
They wont if things continue to reverse, especially with chinese exchanges being shut down, the biggest proponents of 2X/Bcash/mempoolSpamming/etc. I think Xapo holds to the NYA because they don't want their reputation/credibility to be diminished if they betray the agreement they signed.

the other asic makers should come up with their own open-source asicboost (segwit compatible), even maybe work together and with free devs, so the current patent-attack on bitcoin can be nullified ; and make it even better than asicboost, so that bitmain is forced to adopt this "better open source asicboost", so then the only reason bitmain would not run segwit would be vengeance/ego.  This patent-attack is the first time in bitcoin history that bitcoin's futrue is so seriously threatened.
Besides, I am surprised bitcoin is not over due to the bitmain monopoly/drama. this is incredibly concerning, as andreas puts it. :-(

What is wrong is to publish this picture on the Internet, especially on this sub, because bitcoin is quite political, and this could be seen as trying to promote a political view with impressionable, helpless kids; teaching about bitcoin on the other hand is fine.

I totally agree, computers, especially the Internet, completely mess with the mind of the developing minds, not to mention the catastrophic effects of screens on myopia. ADHD, memory problem, creativity issues, all down to computers/internet use before proper age. Education about how to use the Internet without becoming a zombie should be a thing. Now, educating about bitcoin or economy is something different that doesn't require a computer at that age.

Really good move from coinbase, given the legal war that is going to happen against bitcoin, esp. in US. Also, her employment maybe has nothing to do with the frozen account. The current frozen account looks more like coherent with the usual coinbase strategy towards "regulators". They know they might be rekt at any given moment.
