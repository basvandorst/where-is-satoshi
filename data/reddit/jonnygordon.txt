I checked with them on site - "Mount Gaux" is how they pronounce it.

Howdy! Reuters reporter Jon Gordon here. Long-time lurker here, but thought I'd sign up to share this and some more of my team's work with the Reddit community.

It stays as USD or Euro in the exchange books. So they may trade with it again later whenever they feel the price is right.

Very cool, CultureShip! Great to hear from a veteran. The baron is doing interesting things in FX still, and I might have a trick up my sleeves for the next bitcoin story that works that in. Take care mate and thanks for the feedback!

No sir, I do not have an account (yet!). I thought about buying one for the story, but I was actually short of yen at the time! Plus it wouldn't have been fair to skip the queue of people waiting to sign up for Mt. Gox at the time!

Hi friends, I'm the Reuters reporter who put this together. 
Fair points here, but just to explain our thinking here. The idea was to to approach this from a mainstream perspective (imagine if your non-techie cousin tried to get into mining - these are the challenges he/she would face). 
We are planning to refine the rig and show that in an updated video piece, but that'll be a few weeks off. And don't worry, I plan on running this for more than 7 days. Need to make that investment cash back, right? ;)
If you have any questions/comments/criticism, feel free to shoot them my way. We are also keen to cover the crypto currency market, so if you have ideas or a hot tip, inbox me.

The guy doing the interview is in fact moi. So, critique duly noted.
TIL who Max Keiser is.

Ah, the Baron's reach is impressive! I can imagine the reception you go then. Today it's clear the world needs more money/payment innovation, whether it's in Bitcoin or another form.

Hilarious! Occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
