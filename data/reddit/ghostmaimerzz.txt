Someone already replied this but I'll say it again. 
Only invest in Bitcoin what you are prepared to lose.

I think there might be issues on the website. 
What worked for me during the 9k dip was using their app to verify and I buy from the app as well.

Buy from coinbase and then transfer all of it to GDAX. It's instant and free and run by the same company.

" However, I don't have experience with transferring big amounts of money, so I can't tell from personal experience."
You and me both haha

There are always ATH's and really no way to make rational decisions to sell at, imo. Lol you got folks who sold at 11k and waiting for the dip. Haha
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:03:24
That's the way to go. Good luck, friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:38:13
That's due to the Korean and Japanese exchanges I believe.

It's important to diversify. Bitcoin and crypto currency in general is an unstable beast. So keep investments in many things but keep it reasonable. 
Only put in what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:37:40
Almost 13k :D
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:03:32
Was having your same issue. Verifying through coinbase app worked for me.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:29:21
I'd be interested in a Discord server, too.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:35:24
That's if your willing to wait the few days of your bank wire/transfer to go through. I rather pay the fees and honestly I can buy the dip faster and already pay off my fee.

Think of the millions you missed out on Apple or Microsoft.. to be honest there was no way you could have predicted it being at what it is right now. So instead of letting the past hurt you think of what you can do today. Bitcoin is very much still in infancy my friend. Take that how you will. Invest wisely.

I hope you're joking haha

Oh wow, congrats! I've invested minimal amounts because I'm a piss poor student but I'm making small amounts with the climb! Any profit is good profit but I'm not confident in other Altcoin tbh.. but I think that's because the research into other crypto scares me. 
Thanks for sharing.

Thanks for your insider information, bud
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:28:40
That's silly. Currency is currency. I'm curious to know how they can tell the difference between income and Bitcoin earnings.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:23:59
But Isn't another company, I think it is CBOE if I'm not mistaken, opening up their own futures on the 10th? Are you not worried about that one?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:28:35
Then I would say go for it. Watch the market to see if it's going up or down at my time of posting. It just hit 13500.

I believe that's the deal with the United States IRS as well. If suddenly all that money is dropped into your account tax-free your going to have someone knocking on your door. I read else where that you risk an audit or even suspicions of money laundering. How true that is, however, I'm not sure..
