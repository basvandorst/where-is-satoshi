Also the difference between your/you're should have been made clear by Mr. Bergstrom

I clearly never said anything about the near-future price movements of Bitcoin... If you hold Bitcoins as an "investment" of sorts, I think it is weak on fundamental grounds. But I don't make any prediction as to what the price will be at any given point in time. It could triple in price in the next few weeks, and I wouldn't suddenly be "wrong". My article had nothing to do with whether you should buy or sell Bitcoins...

I think that you think my article was more negative than it was... Maybe I made it sound that way? When you say "Then you talk about consumer protection. We invented a transfer of value network. That's what we did. We invented electronic cash. Let visa or mastercard handle our escrow if they wish," that is very much my point. After all, I am saying that Satoshi was not taking objection to Visa or Mastercard. He was trying to make online transactions more like cash transactions. 
Further, you assume that I'm somehow against online transactions being more like cash transactions. I'm not. I'm just saying it has limited usefulness. Limited, in the sense that sometimes we prefer Visa or Mastercard. But in no way is that bad. When you argue that my objection is to the way people use cash, that's partially true. But it's very much my point. I'm saying "Bitcoin is good in cases when you would use cash." I then explain when people prefer cash. It isn't to say Bitcoin is bad, just that "this is what it is"
When you say "That's it. That's a lot. But that's it." I think you are actually saying what I'm saying. You seem on the defensive about my article. But really it's saying the same thing. Bitcoin isn't trying to replace Visa or Mastercard. It's trying to act as cash in online form. Which itself has value. But it doesn't mean the world's currencies are about to buckle at their knees, which was my point. 
Ultimately, you seem to be thinking my article was anti-Bitcoin. Rather, it presented a very similar picture of Bitcoin that you present (we very much diverge on the supply issue, but I'm not going there). 
This isn't a "for" or "against" issue. I'm allowed to criticise Bitcoin supporters while being one in my own right. If you think this will displace traditional currency, oust the government, or overthrow traditional payment systems, we disagree. But if you see Bitcoin is a useful innovation in cryptography that might (although I will note many drawbacks in a future article) have potential value, then we're on the same page

Meh, I think you're referring to very traditional sources of media. I would love to see a study on the overall reporting of Bitcoin (favorable/neutral/unfavorable) and connotation, though. But I do think numerous sources (specifically online) have conformed to my statement

I think when I said "most people" I more meant "most people reading this". In which case, I think my audience is less into the traditional BBC/CNN and more into... well, Reddit. 
But yes, point taken. I actually had that line in because it was the intro to my research paper, which criticised two academic papers on Bitcoin... and that's how they portrayed it. You have a point though
@_date: 2014-08-23 21:27:16
I agree 
@_date: 2014-08-24 06:18:52
I will inform my law professors that I don't actually deserve all of the As I have received on research papers. Thanks
@_date: 2014-08-23 21:32:00
Agreed but I don't think that's true of the audience reading this article. But in any event, I concede on that point. I will make sure not to say that in the future. I do appreciate the feedback

Oh I don't say that Satoshi does not have some libertarian views. Plus, Satoshi even says Bitcoin will be interesting to libertarians. 
But I don't think that is fully reflected in Bitcoin's design. I think Satoshi was dealing with problems commonly associated with micropayments. It is reflected in many of the arguments he makes, when matched against earlier writings of others on the topic
@_date: 2014-08-23 21:05:42
So your argument is that Bitcoin cannot possibly be doomed, cannot possibly fail, because... it's p2p? People have to ascribe some value to Bitcoin for it to be capable of transferring value
@_date: 2014-08-23 22:14:56
Right... so the dispute resolution issues?
In any event, if you'd like to inform me of the flaws I missed (believe me, this article was not trying to point out all of the flaws of Bitcoin), feel free to let me know and I can make sure to include the information in a new article later on
@_date: 2015-01-06 04:59:49
As boobooempire points out, you can cash bitcoin out quickly. Stealing doesn't say anything about expectations of future value...

Law degree is not equal to license to practice law. I appreciate the effort though. Maybe that course you cited on college writing had something on drawing conclusions from information? Jumping to "license to practice" from the fact that I receive As from law professors was flawed.
