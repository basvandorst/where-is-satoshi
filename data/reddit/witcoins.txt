Wrong. Many Amish do use electricity (and even the internet!). Not all Amish sects are so strict. Additionally, the Amish are not exempt from laws requiring certain goods they sell to the public (like milk) be refrigerated, so even the most strict Amish sects use electricity to power those refrigerators.

Haha, you are pretty much wrong about all of that.
The internet was created by the US military in conjunction with a handful of US universities. The vast majority of the internet backbone is located in and owned by the US, as are most DNS servers. 
The internet is heavily regulated by the US government. In fact, many other governments got so pissed awhile back that the US wouldn't give *them* more regulatory control. Those countries talked seriously about creating their own internet but those talks never went anywhere.
Much like the GPS system (which was created by the US military and whose satellites are entirely owned and operated by the US), the US could cut off any other country or countries from using the internet if they wished.
Meanwhile you have the countrywide website blacklists by China and Australia that show that any government can censor what their civilians can see.

Man, that sure would beat the USD's "PR department"... oh wait, it doesn't need one. Because it's real money. You're a funny guy, John Ratcliff.
And by "PR department" what you really mean is "someone to put a positive spin on all the negative things that would cause any sane person to run screaming away from bitcoins."


You know what, I agree with you for once. This guy would be perfect for talking to the public about bitcoins:

Hey guys, remember when Apple removed your app and told you to remove certain functionality from it? Do you also remember removing that functionality until Apple accepted the app again and then you secretly added that functionality back in?
Do you really have no idea why they'd kick you off without engaging you first? What they have done seems reasonable to me.
@_date: 2014-03-19 10:36:39


This, if true, would be fucking fantastic. They'd be going after all the little shits like Erik.


This likely is true. Roger fled the US not too long ago to an undisclosed Caribbean island, stating that he had the feeling that someone will be trying to stick him "in a cage" soonish. (My guess is that he used his relationship with Mark Karpeles to withdraw his own bitcoins from Mt. Gox while everyone else was locked out and before Mark announced the theft.)
The problem, though, is that it's impossible to know whether any of this is true since MP has no problem with lying. He's photoshopped screenshots before to make himself look like a much tougher guy than he actually is and I get that same vibe from the last few emails he posted. I doubt he actually sent those. And if he's lying about that, the whole post is dubious at best.

Your dumb tirades are getting longer. How do you type so much nonsense without stopping to think? Do your hands operate independently of your brain?
Between paragraphs of stuff that would be best described as literally retarded (If everyone uses bitcoin then it's valuable! Yay!), you keep throwing out shit that I've perfectly refuted. For some reason you keep stubbornly pushing on with the same wrong bullshit. Like:


No. No one other than you idiots will *ever* think this. While people might have an extra $10, no one is interested in throwing it away. At best, you're asking people to buy an insanely expensive lottery ticket. They'd get better odds and cheaper buy-ins by buying lotto tickets from their local convenience store.
You also keep pulling up the whole check-splitting thing. John, what restaurant do you eat at that won't split your check for you? Are you too dumb to know that they do that or too antisocial to ask your server to do so? You are "solving" a problem that doesn't exist and calling it revolutionary. It is not.


Well, yeah. You know who else doesn't think like you? 99.9999999% of the human population. Do you wonder why these randomly vomited texts of yours never convert anyone? It's because *bitcoins are dumb* and most people are smart enough to see that. I'm sorry that you aren't.

Haha, yet more stupid shit from Erik Voorhees. Yeah, you can live on bitcoin exclusively... because all of your transactions are being converted to USD. You're not paying the IRS with bitcoins here; you're giving your bitcoins to a middleman (who is taking a cut!) who then gives USD to the government. Saying you can pay your taxes with bitcoins is like saying that people who use Bitpay are accepting bitcoins; they're *not*.

I bought my groceries with USD at any grocery store in the US and it was so easy!
For those of you that are interested I'll try to breakdown how the process worked. I picked out shit to buy and brought it to the register. At checkout the cashier rang me up and gave me the total. I slid my credit card through the card reader and signed for the transaction. She said "Great, thanks for shopping with [any grocery store in the US]." 
It was easier than I could have possibly imagined. I will be buying my groceries at [any grocery store in the US] now.

This is terrible but the charity itself should take a lot of the blame. This is an example of why it's fiscally irresponsible for a charity to store funds in bitcoins. They should have stored their funds in real money in a real bank with real insurance.
This charity needs to be thoroughly investigated.

They made their choice and now you can make your choice to not buy their products. The real reason you're upset is that you know that Apple's revenue from bitcoiners is so tiny that they won't give a shit.

Poor me, I have to correctly report and pay taxes like everyone else. It's so much work. This is totally unfair!
*throws tantrum like a two-year-old*
Sorry, guys, you're going to have to grow up and start taking some responsibility. What the IRS has told you to do is not hard or burdensome; you're just being whiny little shits. Personally, I can't wait for the inevitable bitcoiners who will decide to ignore the IRS and get audited.
Edit: And yes, these guidelines *will* stick. You guys seem to think that the IRS doesn't understand how bitcoins work and how much of a "burden" the guidelines are to bitcoiners. I guarantee you that you are wrong, and that is *the entire reason* they've given these guidelines. I assure you they thought long and hard about it.
Edit 2: And after reporting, you should pay the taxes by cashing out that bitcoin I told Rassah to give you. See? You're all good.
Edit 3: This is the second thread in a couple of days where I've seen Reddit user "CruiseMyDoor" being the voice of reason amongst the absolute insanity you guys use on a daily basis. Maybe not all bitcoiners are absolute idiots.

Actually, that's a good example of why people will continue using Paypal instead of bitcoins: Paypal has the extremely vital consumer protection called chargebacks. Bitcoin does not; therefore it is doomed. No customer is going to willingly throw that protection away.

People in general keep not giving a shit about bitcoins regardless of price (or, as you guys call it, "value" -- note the quotation marks) because there's no reason to. Libertarians drive the price of bitcoins up by buying them from each other for steadily increasing amounts. Bitcoins continue being traded among only libertarians and become increasingly worthless even while the price goes up. All bitcoin businesses will continue pricing their wares in USD, constantly changing the price to match the exchange rate on Empty Gox and most will still only accept Bitpay, thus not really accepting bitcoins at all. Libertarians will still have their heads up thier asses and will smugly pontificate on things that they absolutely do not understand, such as money, technology, math, etc.
I feel pretty good about those predictions. It's pretty much a repeat of 2013, after all.
Edit: Oh, I almost forgot: this subreddit will receive new threads daily wherein people complain about all their bitcoins being lost or stolen.

On the first one, uh... you pretty much proved the opposite of what you seem to believe. You've shown that there is likely an *even greater* "wealth" disparity than it first appears, given that the people with the addresses containing the most bitcoins likely also have other addresses, thus having more bitcoins.








You seem too dumb to understand that what I have just quoted *is the problem*. The bitcoin network is a gigantic waste of computer power and electricity. As you stated, it doesn't take much at all to run the bitcoin network yet idiots keep throwing more and more computing power at it because they're clueless morons believing they can get rich quick.
I have a real quick third bitcoin myth to bust:


This is *clearly* false. Proof: this dumb thread. YOU'RE WELCOME.
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:03:28
Hahaha, no. It's the exact opposite. Every time the bitcoin price has plummeted, the drop was halted by the mysterious trading engine lag at Mt. Gox. And by "trading engine lag," I mean someone at Gox likely pulled the plug on their servers so no one could trade at all.
That safety net is now gone. The next time there's a huge price drop, watch out!
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:41:23
There's so many things wrong with that chart that it's hard to know where to begin. Here goes:
1. "Number of transactions" is extremely vague. Without more clarity, it's safe to assume that the majority of those transactions are the buying and selling of bitcoins themselves or people moving their bitcoins from one wallet to another.
2. For their source, they listed themselves. There's a reason you can't list yourself as a source on any kind of research. This makes the entire chart suspect.
3. The vast majority of the transactions (other than the buying and selling of bitcoins) are through Bitpay and Coinbase. These do not count. Those transactions are basically bitcoiners circulating bitcoins among themselves while giving real money to merchants.
4. Even if all of the above were false, that's still an incredibly tiny number of transactions. In order for anyone to take bitcoins seriously as a currency, that number will need to increase by several orders of magnitude. We all know that that won't happen.
5. Even if I were to concede all of those points to you (lol), while the number of transactions is *somewhat* important, it's not the only important thing. The most important thing is bitcoin's volatility. The value of bitcoins will never stabilize; the only thing bitcoins are good for is speculation by idiots. Don't point at Bitpay/Coinbase; businesses using either of those companies are *not* accepting bitcoins. In fact, that Lamborghini dealer made it a point to go to the media to declare that they did not accept bitcoins and did not want bitcoins; all they knew was they received cash for the car.
And while we're on the subject, let's discuss your hypocrisy here. It wasn't too long ago that the number you were pointing to was the bitcoin price on Mt. Gox. You said, and I quote: "Scoreboard!"




Now that the Mt. Gox numbers don't look so good, you've conveniently forgotten that "scoreboard." Moving the goalposts, like you've done with this thread, is disingenous and frankly, dumb. But you're no stranger to that. Keep saying whatever you think sounds best at the time and hoping that no one calls you out on it!

I gotta say, reading this put a smile on my face. That slimy fuck finally got what was coming to him. Any other shady well-known bitcoiners should be very, very afraid by now. Roger Ver is almost certainly next (extradition, motherfucker) and ideally Erik Voorhees would be right behind him but realistically I'd say someone at Bitpay would be nabbed before Erik.
The best thing is that this instantly killed all credibility the Bitcoin Foundation had with the government. I get the feeling that they might revisit those talks and look at them in a different light.

"Under attack?" That's overly dramatic. Jason has known for awhile now that the city wants him to close that Death Swamp for health and safety concerns. And he should. He's not helping anyone with this kind of thing; he's actively hurting both the homeless and the residents of that neighborhood.
It's gotta go, Jason. You are doing a bad thing and you need to stop.

So a site that has had a truly staggering number of scam accusations made against it and also most of the time sells stuff for way more than Newegg or Amazon is now taking play money. Good for you, bitcoiners! You're really going places. Honestly, given TigerDirect's reputation, I'd actually expected them to embrace bitcoins sooner.
And let's be clear here; TigerDirect is not actually accepting bitcoins. There's accepting bitcoins and then there's "accepting bitcoins." The latter means that someone is actually accepting real money and never touches the bitcoins. TigerDirect, like Overstock (and nearly every other company), is "accepting bitcoins."
Now go buy some shit from TigerDirect.

At least you gave them some paper, though. Maybe they can write something on it; that way your gift won't go to waste. Who am I kidding? You probably have written down the private keys and will be taking the bitcoins back since you know they won't be able to do anything with them.

Here's the problem with that statement: if you can't read code yourself or simply don't have the time to pore through every last line of code, you still have to trust *somebody* who *can* do so and says it's all good.

The IRS has told bitcoiners to send them tons of paperwork. Because paperwork *is their fucking job, you moron.* 4000 pages is nothing to them. They want as much paperwork as you can possibly create. In fact, they'll audit you if you *don't* send in that much.

Uh... because the vast majority of people are just fine with credit cards. They are much better than bitcoins in every possible way. But hey, I'm glad that you guys found dying retailers with scores of 1.67 out of 10 (TigerDirect) and 2.33 out of 10 (Overstock) on Reseller Ratings to buy your dumb shit at. If you get ripped off, it's your own damn fault.
Let me ask you something: why do you say things like:


and then follow it with something that isn't true? Do you really think there's some burning desire like this in the public at large? If so, you need to step out of your echo chamber and into the real world. Ask that question to any random person on the street and the only answer you'll get will be the person looking at you like you're dumb as hell. Because you are.
Edit: Real life isn't going to be kind to you people when bitcoin collapses, as it's destined to. You should probably step out of your bubble and work on accepting and dealing with reality immediately instead of coming up with all of this stupid bullshit that simply isn't true no matter how much you wish it to be.

Embarrassment? You embarrass too easily, John. I'm going to laugh very hard at you if it's confirmed that it's him. There's more evidence leaning toward it being him than not.
I have a question, John, and it's been something I've been puzzling about for a few days; hopefully you can enlighten me. I don't understand the name of your site. There can only be three reasons for giving it such a name and I'm not sure which it is. Is it:
1. You don't know the difference between a suppository and a repository. I did check and no, you're not using some arcane definition of the word "suppository" that I simply was not familiar with. There's no way to twist the word into what you seem to think it means.
2. You write your nonsense in the hope that readers will take it and cram it up their asses.
3. You are making some kind of meta-joke that my feeble mind could not ever hope to comprehend. (Not likely.)
Which is it, John? And keep in mind that you're a dirty fucking liar if you say it's the third.

Hey dumbass: they repeatedly warn you because 1) they're not concerned about your money; they're concerned about your usage of their service and 2) you are too fucking dumb to have understood the first warning, or the second, or the third, repeat ad nauseam.


If you're using their services to do these things (and I suspect you are; even *your* dumb ass can't possibly be dumb enough to have gone 100% bitcoins), then you are dead fucking wrong. It *is* their business and they can conduct that business how they please. You don't get full rein over the usage of someone else's property. They can tell you how you may use it and if you don't like it, you can get the fuck out.

Ask John Ratcliff about the bitcoins he's tried to force on me. You people are so delusional that you think that if only someone *tries* using bitcoins, they'll instantly become true believers. This is false. They are valueless and no one with any amount of intelligence wants them.
And, well, frankly... you disgust me, Rassah. Your posts here and on Bitcointalk show that you are one of the sleaziest people I have ever seen. I want nothing from you ever.
So, you have my blessing to give the bitcoin you were going to give to me to Reddit user "paleh0rse" instead.

This lady is an idiot. Her nonsense editorial shows that she understands neither central banking nor bitcoins. A few of her more stupid assertions are:


That's *the exact definition* of "understood by only a few." Believe it or not, most people can't actually read source code.


Indeed. Zero is less than the number of people controlling the USD. Congrats on understanding first-grade math.


This sure is a winning argument. "Yeah, you can get screwed over; no big deal."


So anyone who doesn't want to get ripped off should put a lot more time and effort than necessary for making a simple transaction. Gotcha. And "bad user reviews?" Oh no, not that. No business will ever survive if they get bad user reviews! To trot that out as an example is absurd and, frankly, demonstrates a child's level of knowledge about making transactions.


If you're "losing" money to inflation then you're doing it wrong. You should be investing that money.

1. Nobody ever said there's no inflation. There is inflation and it's a good thing. Deflation is a bad thing.
2. Your examples *aren't what inflation is*. I love how bitcoiners eagerly spout off on topics they don't know shit about.
Edit: Also, lol at "banksters" and "sheeples." Those two "words" are a clear sign that someone doesn't know what he's talking about.
Edit 2: The worst of your examples is the price of gasoline. The price of gasoline is derived from the price of oil, which is set by OPEC. OPEC picks a price point which they feel will make them the most money and then increase/decrease production until it's reached that price.

Congratulations! You have won the prestigious Clueless Bitcoiner of the Day award!


This is because most people understand what you don't seem to: 100x is an unrealistic rate of return. That will not sustain itself and the rate of return will soon be in the negative numbers. 


Then you don't get out much. Ask most people and they will tell you that the lottery is indeed a very stupid thing. Have you ever heard the old saying, "A lottery is a tax on people who are terrible at math."? (Honestly, that applies to bitcoins as well.) 
Most people will also tell you that lotteries are immoral since they prey mostly on the stupid and on the destitute. The vast majority of the people who play the lottery are the people who can least afford it. What I usually see is people who are clearly in rough times financially buying hundreds of dollars' worth of lottery tickets every week. If you don't understand that lotteries are a bad thing then you're stupid or immoral or both.


Haha, what? The lottery is super risky but bitcoins are even more so. There's no fucking way any smart person will ever buy any appreciable amount of bitcoins, just like they won't buy lottery tickets.

You've shown a lot of ignorance all over this thread but this bit of bullshit I just quoted there is my favorite. You clearly don't understand how credit cards work. You don't "lose funds" with a credit card. It's simply not possible. The worst that could possibly happen is that a thief makes charges against your credit limit. Then you simply inform the credit card company that you did not make those purchases and they restore your credit limit. At no point is any of your money even slightly at risk.
You might be thinking of debit cards, but it is extremely stupid to pay for most things with a debit card rather than a credit card. If your parents were using a debit card then the problem is that, well, they're just stupid.
Here's an idea: wait until you are old enough to understand how something works before you criticize it.
@_date: 2014-01-24 05:20:17
Is this really so hard for your bitcoin-addled mind to comprehend? The only consumers who want bitcoins are drug dealers and arms dealers. The number of places accepting bitcoins increasing means absolutely nothing *since no one will spend bitcoins there.*

If you think the county's not going to haul you back into court for a *non*-emergency hearing then you are very naive. The judge simply decided it wasn't an emergency. It will happen soon.
In the meantime, you should probably start working on turning the place into less of a shithole. For starters, you should tear down that ridiculous outhouse that almost certainly wasn't built to code, given that you didn't even bother to get a permit to build it in the first place. And you should clean the place up to the point where it's no longer in danger of causing major illness outbreaks, which is another point the county brought up.

That demolishes the entire premise of your project right there. Doing this means that you will be living off of fiat, and thus your project will be a tremendous failure.

Your problem is that people *do* understand bitcoins and it's plainly clear that bitcoins are terrible and no amount of (frankly, bizarre) marketing can change that. Your product is a dud. I know some of you don't like to hear that since your ideology or money or both are tied up in this cargo culting nonsense, but it is what it is.
You guys seem to think that if someone refuses to use bitcoins, they must not understand them. This is both false and insulting. What you don't seem to be able to grasp is that people can understand something as much as you do and yet come to the opposite opinion. If someone says no to bitcoins, leave them alone.
You guys also seem pretty determined to learn the hard way why current fiscal policy is what it is. And make no mistake; if you have all your money put into bitcoins, then learn you shall. And the teacher, reality, can be a cruel mistress.

What is so hard about this for you dumbasses to comprehend? When something has daily price swings in the double- to triple-digit range, that is not stable. That's extremely unstable. And comparing bitcoins to stocks is disingenuous given that what you're really (dumbly) hoping to accomplish is to replace the USD, not stocks. Look at the USD's price stability. *That* is what stability looks like, not this horseshit. When bitcoin's price gets to *that* level of stability, let me know. Otherwise there's still no reason for anyone to give a shit about your play money.

He even brings up some major issues with bitcoins only to then hand-wave them away without explaining why they're not real issues or what could be done to solve them. *That's because there is no answer to that.*
The guy's just trying to sucker more people into his investment so that he gets more out of it. And you guys are the suckers.

(Neckbeard walks into a store and starts banging his card against the card reader when he checks out. Confused, he then runs his card through the reader backwards. Finally, out of frustration, he throws the card at the cashier, who then comically slips and falls.)
Voiceover: Credit cards are soooooooo hard to use!
(Scene changes to the same neckbeard in front of his computer. He tries typing his credit card number into the proper field on the website he's making his purchase from, but it keeps rejecting the card because he's too dumb to enter the card number correctly. He then falls to the ground and starts having a tantrum.)
Voiceover: There must be a better way!

What percentage of Overstock's sales during that time period were made with bitcoins? All the other numbers you're throwing out are misleading fluff.

Others in this thread have already covered why your mentions of the price are dumb (like you, I could take arbitrary dates and show that the price of bitcoin tanked during that period) so I'm going to ignore those issues and point out these:
1. The whole concept of "antifragility" is complete nonsense and anyone using the term to describe something shows a lack of critical thinking and thus their opinions should be ignored.
2. This: 


is the part that matters. This:


does not matter. The price of bitcoins is set entirely by speculation. Meanwhile, millions of dollars of wealth have completely evaporated from the bitcoin ecosystem in one fell swoop. That should be cause for concern.
You are a disingenuous piece of shit. You pull random, completely unrelated facts and paste them together into a chimera of stupid and hope no one ever calls you out on it. Surprise, most people aren't as dumb as bitcoiners and see right through your stupid shit.

No, the price is *still* too volatile to be useful as a medium of exchange, and even if it wasn't, it would be so again soon enough. When the price is swinging at a maximum of one cent per day and has done so for over a year, then you might have a point.

The biggest problem with this idea is not, as many of you seem to believe, the fact that the government has no reason to sell their bitcoins to someone offering far less money than some other idiots would pay for them and who needs ninety days to scrape the cash together (although that *is* a problem). 
The biggest problem is that the government is required by law to either destroy them or auction them; there is no other option. This guy undoubtedly knows they'd never take his offer and is just trying to gain buzz for his stupid "business."
The thing is, though... there's not really all that much to be gained by auctioning them, either; destroying them by sending them to a black hole address is probably the better option. The few million dollars that the sale would bring is pocket change to the US government.
I will laugh pretty hard if they destroy them. I think that's a good possibility given that the FBI has already established that they love trolling you guys with the whole "324" thing.

You are someone dumb enough to put all his money into lottery tickets and lucky enough that it paid off. Now you're someone dumb enough to take the lottery money he won and put all of it back into lottery tickets.

I've done the same thing many times! Although I chose to send actual money (r/actualmoney) instead of bitcoins. This had the additional bonus over bitcoins of the recipient being able to actually *use* what I sent them! The future is here!

Yeah, that's an even worse plan than accepting bitcoins directly, which is already bad enough. Where do you expect him to scrounge up the tens of millions of dollars in government fees? That's a requirement for an ATM.
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:33:05


Oh, is that all it would take? Why that surely sounds possi... oh wait. How do you propose to get a few hundred million people to purchase bitcoins?
"Hey guys, you hear about this volatile 'currency' you can't buy much with? What if I told you that it would be less volatile if we all bought some? Wouldn't that be great? You're asking why you should buy them when your actual money works fine? Well, um, I mean..."
Literally no one on the planet other than your merry band of libertarian retards gives one shit about the "principles" of bitcoins that you guys are always spouting off. There is no reason for anyone to own bitcoins, and no reasonable person will have anything to do with them. NO ONE.

The ethereum scam (self.Bitcoin)
submitted 4 hours ago* by jratcliff63367
As a software engineer myself I can recognize when someone is throwing out a lot of technobabble as a smokescreen to dazzle nontechnical people into believing there is substance where there is actually only vaporware.
Sadly I have seen far too many startups get away with this hall of mirrors as they consume a pile of VC money.
Let's not ask any hard questions about this amazing "Turing complete" scripting language. Let's just be dazzled by a lot of fast talking tech jargon from teenage developers.
The reality is that most of bitcoin's problems arise not from it being too simple but rather than from it being too complex. The bitcoin protocol and source code is a bit of a mess and anyone who has ever tried to manually parse the blockchain or sign a transaction knows this.
Ethereum is textbook vaporware that is suckering in a bunch of people easily dazzled by technical Mumbo-Jumbo.
You need a Turing complete scripting language in a blockchain like you need a hole in your head.
Ethereum is just another alt-coin pump and dump like all of the rest. And, let's be clear, on hype alone it will make a lot of people very rich; in the short term.
In the long term people will see that it was a hype fueled bubble that solves no particular problem and will stand on the wreckage of Mastercoin, mooncoin, maxcoin, and unobtanium.
Somebody had to say this as a community service if nothing else. And, any comments defending ethereum, must be in the form of a 10,000 line ethereum Turing complete script that runs in an infinite loop producing nothing of value.
EDIT: "Scam" may have been too strong a word. The ethereum people probably believe in their concept but when they communicate it there is an enormous amount of hand waving and the use of buzz words like "Turing complete" which essentially means 'and then magic happens'. They provide no details since they don't think it is necessary. After all, you know, "Turing".
I can think of no use case where a cryptographically secure peer to peer value transmission system would not be better served by hardened, rigid, well defined and enforced protocols versus an arbitrary open ended general purpose programming language.
Look at the chaos caused by the transaction malleability bug simply because Satoshi overlooked the fact that a digital signature could have multiple valid representations.

This thread showcases one of the things I love most about bitcoiners. You guys think up these completely new, elaborate, impractical, expensive and difficult to use technologies that have to be designed, built, shipped, and implemented in order to "solve" problems that are already handled quickly, cheaply, and conveniently by credit cards and the existing fiat financial industry. And at no point do you stop and ask yourself if what you're proposing is completely retarded.

"Automated  and mentions
The  and Mention functions are intended to make communication between users easier, and automating these processes in order to reach many users is considered an abuse of the feature. If you are automatically sending  messages or Mentions to many users, the recipients must request or approve this action in advance. **For example, sending automated  based on keyword searches is not permitted.**"

First off, nice referring to and praising yourself in the third-person to start your nonsense off with.
Now, as for the rest of it... much like with the other screeds you write, I'm still at a loss as to whether you are just extremely stupid or being purposely misleading. You use so many logical fallacies in your arguments that it would be much simpler for me to just say, "keep this related to currency, Eryk," but it's more fun to point them all out (that first paragraph is appeal to authority fallacy, by the way), so...


This logical fallacy is called "appeal to motive."


Was it? Don't make shit up, Eric. Your own damn wiki says otherwise.
'MtGox, called "Mount Gox" or "MTGOX", has been the most widely used bitcoin currency exchange market[1] since it was started.' 


I like how you don't seem to understand figurative language and are trying to pick apart what he's saying by taking every word literally. When you have to resort to that, you don't have much of an argument. This logical fallacy is referred to as "equivocation."


Are you seriously saying that there are no security issues inherent to bitcoins themselves? Are you high?




Notice that you didn't say he was wrong, because he's not.


What? The current inflation rate of the USD has been fixed at 1.2%. Please trot out the "math" you're using to determine your assertion here. Show your work.




Association fallacy.








Appeal to probability fallacy.






Good lord. Let's see...
Straw man fallacy
Appeal to ridicule fallacy
Loaded question fallacy
Moving the goal posts fallacy
Red herring fallacy
False analogy fallacy

I don't know why I'm helping a bitcoiner, but here goes.
The thing about "brain wallets" is that they can be cracked extremely easily. There's actually a brute force bot out there now that cracks nearly every brain wallet shortly after creation and empties them. I think the average brain wallet lasts a few seconds to a few minutes before the bot nabs it.

You are so wrong it's not even funny. Scarcity is one of bitcoin's fatal flaws and one of the reasons it'll never be adopted as a currency or taken seriously at all. An inflexible monetary supply causes an economy to seize up.

Thank God bitcoiners will never get their way on these things. You guys would destroy the entire economy in a matter of months and set society back to the Dark Ages. Fortunately most people have more sense than to ever get caught up in this and things like cryptocurrency.

FOMO (what you're promoting) is absolutely the worst reason to buy/invest in anything. It's based in emotion, not facts or critical thought. This is why the vast majority of people are too smart to do something like that.
And there's nothing to suggest that the price of bitcoins won't continue to crash for the foreseeable future. If people buy bitcoins now based on your stupid advice, what will you tell them when the price drops another 70% and they lose everything? Will *you* make them whole? Highly unlikely since you'll be broke yourself.

People who think inflation is theft are relying on a knee jerk, emotional reaction rather than taking the time to actually understand what inflation is and how it works and why a small amount of inflation is a good thing. Hyperinflation like what Venezuela is going through now is caused by the corrupt government losing proper control of the supply, as well as other countries refusing to trade with them.
Let me ask you something: if the US government has actually destroyed the value of the dollar over the past fifty years as you believe, why is your standard of living so much better than that of people who lived fifty years ago? Why is your life so much more comfortable than theirs? The actual dollar amount of your salary or prices in a store don't reflect actual value. Comparing numbers in dollars between today and any point in the past means absolutely nothing. It's a meaningless comparison. The two numbers have zero relation. It's a fool's game. And if you'd take a moment to actually critically think about that then it would be extremely obvious.
I'd recommend taking the time to learn more about the subjects of money and inflation. There are any number of books and sites that can help you understand this. Maybe start with children's books on the topic and then work your way up.
Unless, you know, you'd rather disregard facts when they don't line up with your worldview. If that's the case, keep preaching to the wind, brother. Like a preacher on a soapbox on a street corner. Maybe some likeminded passersby will stop to listen. The majority will just ignore your obvious wrongness, though.

No, that's not what they're for. Neither of those agencies has any authority over banks.
Why do so many bitcoiners invoke the SEC like it's some all-powerful agency that has authority over everything financial? The SEC has a very narrow, specific jurisdiction. They have no power to tell banks what they can and can't do unless it involves securities.
Edit: Besides which, banks are a business like any other and have the legal right to choose who they do business with. They are allowed to close any account for any or no reason. They even have the right to deny someone an account in the first place. The only exception is if they deny their services to someone specifically because that person is part of a legally protected class like race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts aren't a protected class.

If I wanted to run a bitcoin scam, here's one good possibility: create a "wallet recovery services" "business" and build up a good reputation by recovering people's wallets for them. Then, when I'm highly trusted and receive several wallets with large amounts of bitcoins, I take the bitcoins and disappear. Then I come back a month later with a different name, like Bob's Wallet Recovery Services.
I'm not saying for sure that that's what this guy is doing but if you don't think it seems shady then you're a little too credulous for your own good.

I'm curious... what do you morons think you're doing? You're giving your precious bitcoins to the government in order to post juvenile insults that they will never read. (It could be argued that I'm doing the exact same thing by insulting you idiots in this subreddit, but I'm not dumb enough to give away stuff for the privilege.)
Seriously, they won't read any of your messages because they don't give a shit and don't need to give a shit. You guys are acting like the shutdown of Silk Road was some kind of ideological crusade against bitcoins. It was not. It's called law enforcement doing their damn job by putting away a criminal (I say "a" but there will almost certainly be more arrests coming in the near future.).
As much as you guys like to fantasize otherwise, the government doesn't give a shit about your stupid play money.

I suspect that that's not possible so if you upvote this post, you should also respond, telling me that you upvoted it.
For those of you with multiple Reddit accounts, this is a good opportunity to use all of them. What say you, bitcoiners? Want to make some bitcoins?

Nobody has ever said that spending ceases under a deflationary monetary system but have fun hacking away at those strawmen, I guess.

BitPay isn't the same as someone actually accepting bitcoins themselves. I love how bitcoiners try to get people to accept bitcoins and then suggest BitPay when the inevitable "why would I want fake money?" questions are asked.
Anyone you "convert" like that isn't actually accepting bitcoins, you goobs. They're accepting USD from BitPay. Hell, that Lamborghini store manager went out of his way to state to the press that he didn't take bitcoins and he won't accept bitcoins; all he cared about was the USD from the wire transfer from BitPay.
It's not the same, you retards.
Edit: Also, BitPay is a private company in an unregulated industry. You don't know for a fact that it will even still exist tomorrow. They could do a runner at any time.

Hmm, yes, let's encourage people to blatantly start businesses that are clearly illegal. Any "online casino" that is based in the US and/or accepts US players will find out exactly how much the US government cannot control your site when they seize it from you and throw you in federal prison.

@_date: 2013-10-22 05:04:30
I've pointed out before that you're an idiot but you don't seem to understand that yet so I'm going to point it out again.
You have no clue how government works. The government does not give one shit about the bitcoin exchange rate (or bitcoins themselves, for that matter). What's going to happen is that first of all, the government will be sitting on them for *years* until they have totally fucked DPR and sent him to rot in prison; those bitcoins are, you know, *evidence*. 
After that, who knows. The government doesn't need to register with itself in order to sell something. I would think that that should be obvious but you do seem to know nothing about anything at all. They may sell them at auction or they may throw them into evidence, where they will never be seen again.
What amuses me is that you have so little knowledge about money, governments, and economies that you are just amazed at a single-digit number of millions of dollars. Do you really think the US government gives a shit about such a measly amount? Do you know how much money the government brings in *each hour?* Millions of dollars ain't shit. It's a fucking rounding error to them.
Sorry to squash your fantasies again but you're one of the bigger idiots here and you really need a good dose of reality, not wishful thinking.
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:37:09

Sweet. Now that you're brazenly breaking the law, I hope your local police look into the highly unethical (and probably illegal) shit you've been doing to the homeless. Are you even properly set up as a charity?
Don't act like you give a shit about the homeless. What you are really after is the love and adoration of bitcoiners, and the fact that you always use what you are doing to shill bitcoins proves that. Putting miners in the houses in your swamp? Are you out of your mind?
I hope you get shut down for good over this, I really do. Then maybe the homeless can be helped, not exploited.

You know, all this bitcoiner spergy shit blows my mind. Every time I think I've seen it all, some idiot like you comes and posts something like this. So let's make this interesting.
If anything even remotely like this happens by the end of fall in 2013 AD, I will buy ten bitcoins, give you five and keep the other five for myself, and then come to this subreddit and say, "I've been so foolish that it's beyond belief. Bitcoins are clearly the way of the future and I am a gigantic fucking idiot for not realizing that earlier. Reddit user WhatIsTheAtlas is a genius and I am but a lowly worm. I am now a true believer in bitcoins and only hope that all bitcoiners will forgive my stupidity."
If it doesn't happen (it won't), all you have to do is come to this subreddit and say, "I clearly do not know what I am talking about and should probably rethink this whole bitcoin thing and sell all of my bitcoins while I still have some money left." You can use my wording or come up with your own as long as it's similar to mine. You don't even have to mention my username.
Sound like a fair deal? Do you agree to this? Not agreeing to this will signify that even you don't believe the verbal diarrhea that you just spewed.

Once he's safely rotting away in prison, the government will do what they do with *all* seized property: auction it off.
The government doesn't give one shit about bitcoins and they damn sure don't see bitcoins as money; bitcoins are not money and they know it. They're certainly not going to put them in some shady bitcoin exchange.

"Honestly, I can see that the money pit isn't all that great. But... I don't feel like I truly understand this hole. I mean, I can stand back and observe what it does but the only real way for me to learn anything is to throw some money into that hole myself. Yeah, that's the ticket!"

You're dumb as hell and even *you* know that that's a terrible analogy, and I suspect that your father does as well. Here's a better one for you:
Bitcoin is like an elevator designed by committee by people who believe themselves to be elevator experts because they've ridden in a few. They didn't bother using sane elevator design and decided to throw out the safety measures like emergency brakes and counterweights. If you get into the elevator, regardless of the floor you're on, it immediately (without you pressing any buttons) skyrockets so hard that it bursts through the roof of the building. It will end up crashing down to earth so hard that it will leave a gigantic impact crater. There will be a public monument built on the site and every day people will go to this monument to see the wreckage and comment to each other that this is why you don't let idiots design elevators.

Clue: The US government doesn't give one shit about bitcoins. You guys have this really weird persecution complex but no one is persecuting you. Bitcoins never entered their minds when they took down Silk Road; all they cared about was taking down a criminal - you know, *their job.* Watching you guys start spinning tales about how it was all about the bitcoins is really amusing.
And of course this didn't affect the bitcoin price; the bitcoin price is entirely propped up by speculators. Nothing in the fiat and/or bitcoin worlds can affect the price, other than the speculators leaving, which they will. At some point you guys are going to be in for a rude awakening when your "vast fortunes" disappear overnight.

Ah yes, I forgot bitcoiners don't have the ability to take things in context but instead separate each statement as its own standalone thought with no ties to the statements around it. The entire thing was an answer to the question. Quote the whole damn thing and don't cherry pick.


Are you serious? You honestly think bitcoins can be "wildly successful" because computers are able to constantly change the prices of things? Have you lost your damn mind? As much as bitcoiners seem to like to believe otherwise, people are not computers. People don't give a shit if the price is constantly updated. What they like is to know that the price they pay for something today will be the same as yesterday or tomorrow.

Can't believe I'm going to defend a bitcoin business but here it is:
They didn't rip you off. They owe you nothing. The sale never completed. You, in the eyes of the law, are whole. Ripping you off would be taking the fiat you paid and giving you nothing in return. Any business has the right to refuse a sale like this as long as it's not for a forbidden reason (race, gender, etc.). The course of action open to you is to not be their customer and advise other people against being their customer. That's it.
Without even getting into the hypocrisy of you wanting to take this to court, given bitcoin's anti-government bias, I'll point out that you have no basis for a lawsuit in the first place. None. Sue them and you'll get laughed out of any courtroom in this country.

Frankly, I agree with you about your son's priorities. Bitcoins are an extremely risky gamble *at best* and if you allow him to keep his money in bitcoins he will end up losing most of it.


* Bitcoin's price is extremely volatile because it's basically based on gambling that the price will go up. There is nothing else that moves the price. It is nearly certain that the "value" will drop dramatically very soon.
* They are easily stolen or destroyed. A cursory glance through this subreddit will allow you to read many, many horror stories that have actually happened.
* They will never be the money of the future. There are too many negative attributes. 
* There's no central authority regulating the price and no central authority to insure the bitcoins, like the FDIC or NCUA. If (when) they're stolen, they're gone for good.
* There are no fraud protections like chargebacks.
That's not a complete list; the negatives are so numerous that it wouldn't be realistic to try to post all of them.


He'd have to cash out the same way he bought them, selling them to a random stranger.
Unfortunately, you've stepped into an echo chamber here; nearly everyone who posts here have deluded themselves into thinking they're going to be rich. They're not.
You shouldn't blindly believe anything you read here (including what I wrote). Look around the internet and see what economists and the financial sector think about bitcoins. I would highly advise that you not read any "economist" opinions that anyone here links you to; these people are heavily biased and cherry pick the tiny number of "economists" who echo their own point of view. That's why I'm not going to link you to any myself.
Please do lots and lots of research on this matter and then do what seems sane to you. Your son is at a gigantic risk until he sells his bitcoins.
Edit: The kid telling you that Amazon and others will soon be accepting bitcoins is sheer lunacy; that will never happen. The kid's 15 and very enthusiastic but he hasn't had time to accumulate much financial wisdom.

In the very long line of stupid things you have posted, this is the stupidest (which is saying a lot). Paypal will never have anything to do with bitcoins. Paypal deals with real money. On the day that Paypal announces they accept bitcoins, I promise that I will leave in shame and never bother bitcoiners ever again. But that will never happen. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:34:01
And...? They were correct not to accept it then and still would be correct now.

You should learn the concept of "reading" and how it works. People generally read from left to right or, in some cases, right to left, not vertically and/or diagonally as you seem to believe.
"There what if was a bank?" Well, I guess that makes as much as anything any other bitcoiner has ever said.

Let me tell you something, Rassah: As both you and Roger know, the Bitcoin100 isn't about charity; it's about ideology. If you really cared about charity, you'd donate actual money without all the damn bitcoin strings attached. It's your money and you can do what you want with it but don't blow smoke up everyone's ass that this is somehow about charity. It isn't and you know it.

b) I can guarantee that most of you whiners who actually do own an iPhone are just grumbling and won't actually ever switch.

No, I want to know the exact items he bought so I can do the exact price comparisons. Every time anyone says they bought something from your store for less than Amazon, they've either been confused about how to look at the pricing on Amazon or they've been lying. Your store itself has been caught in that same lie several times so please forgive me if I don't take your word for it.

No. The point he is making is that no one prices anything in bitcoins because they'd have to change the pricing every few minutes. The people who *do* price things in bitcoins base the price on the USD price of bitcoins.

Haha, you guys are retards. No one other than you will ever care about bitcoins, regardless of the price. You seem to be mistaking "price" for "value." There's no utility to be had with bitcoins so the only people you'll ever get to buy bitcoins for $1000 are other bitcoiners.

I have a real, honest to God question for you:


How in the *fuck* do you restock a motherfucking bitcoin? Am I going to see "open box" bitcoin sales going on here?
"Yes sir, as you can see, this bitcoin *has* been taken out of its box but it still works properly. When it was returned to us, we made sure to inspect it very thoroughly and the only damage is purely cosmetic -- it's just a little bit scuffed. Today, since we're friends now and all, I'll let you have it for the bargain rate of 20% off of its current fiat exchange value. No, not the BitStamp exchange rate; are you high? The Mt. Gox exchange rate, of course."

It's hilarious that you people can type all these words about why litecoins are awful (and I agree; they are awful) and yet not understand that the same argument applies toward bitcoins. The world has no need for bitcoins (regardless of the 'reasons' you people have invented) because fiat money is superior.
You people should probably embrace litecoins given that both bitcoins and litecoins will always be irrelevant. You guys are equal.

You're right; bitcoin *is* the perfect lesson. Unfortunately, you don't seem to have learned that lesson. You've learned some facts and then completely failed to put them together properly. Not only that, but by keeping bitcoins, you're doing the exact opposite of what that lesson should have taught you.
Edit: vvvvv Fractional reserve banking is kinda one of the main reasons the world economy is doing so well. It's not surprising at all that bitcoiners don't understand that.

And I can tell you that it's an undeniable fact that bitcoins are awful and will never go anywhere. Your theory is busted. (And don't tell me I have to use bitcoins before I can criticize them; if I see a pile of shit, I can recognize it as shit without having to taste it.)
Like a lot of other bitcoiners, you seem to have this weird superiority complex. You're not superior. Your understanding of money and technology is weak and because of that, you will likely lose all of your money on this stupid bullshit and won't be able to say you weren't warned.

"The US Dollar may be the world's largest digital currency, but only bitcoin (and other crypto-currencies) may claim to be the electronic equivalent of cash."
what does that even fucking mean? The USD IS electronic cash, dumbass. I'm sure the bitcoiners are proud that you are going to be one of the ones leading them into the brave new world... of bankruptcy and/or prison. How you people sleep at night is beyond me.

If this is true then you understand that you shouldn't waste your money on it. Bitcoins are an interesting proof of concept created by someone who never intended it to be an actual, functioning currency. It has been co-opted by a group of autistic man-children who fantasize that it will make them rich *any second now* and/or powerful beyond their wildest dreams. Nothing these people say or do has any relation at all to reality.

90+% of all accounts on Bitcointalk and r/bitcoin are scammers and sockpuppets of scammers who are trying to scam the sockpuppets of the other scammers.

That's not what "backing" means. Gold is backed by nothing, exactly like bitcoins are. Learn what words mean before attempting to intelligently insert them into a conversation and maybe you won't feel so dumb about using them.
(And bitcoiners who go "well, what about gold?" when bitcoin's flaws are pointed out to them are hilarious because gold has been in a bubble for a long ass time. There is no reason the price of gold should be anywhere near it is, and the price is mostly being propped up by libertarian goldbug nutjobs. So yeah, bitcoins are just like gold in a lot of ways... but that's a bad thing.)

Holy fucking shit, you fucking retard. Your terrible arguments always make my brain hurt and I still can't decide whether you are genuinely an idiot or if you just like to mislead people. I suspect it's the latter, but I could be wrong.


What does any of this have to do with anything? Nothing. You're just grandstanding.


Psst... the gold standard and the deflation that accompanied it caused the Great Depression. Getting off the gold standard is what ended it.




No one ever said otherwise. Stop creating strawmen.


This, and the consequences of this are the *entire* argument against deflation. Don't address anything else.


You are wrong. It's a very bad thing and has been proven to be so many times. Deflation slows the economy to a crawl because spending goes way down. This, in turn, causes high unemployment, which slows the economy down even more, ad infinitum. The spiral is a real and nasty thing.


Your definition of "saving" means hoarding. There is a difference. Learn to grasp that difference.


What you call "prudent," experts call "hoarding."


Ah yes, your own personal experience should be extrapolated to the entire world. The man with millions of dollars "worth" of bitcoins isn't concerned about throwing some of them around. Guess what, most bitcoiners don't have millions of dollars worth of bitcoins. Their experience is going to be vastly dissimilar to yours.


What you believe has no bearing on reality.


Nonsense. First off, not all spending is consumption. Second, spending *is* the economy.


This is a disingenuous question because the second part has nothing to do with the first. The price of bitcoins is set purely by speculation. Right now, bitcoin isn't even deflationary; it's experiencing double-digit percentage inflation. It's inflating *much faster* than the dollar. That drives the speculation. And no, no one is saying the price of bitcoins will rise forever. Anyone who believes that it will is a fool. Eventually the ponzi will have run out of new suckers to lure in and will collapse violently.


Ow! Stop hurting my brain, Erik! People don't buy them because they only have "value" to a small number of libertarians. You can't *do* much of anything with them. Most people don't enjoy speculating on volatile commodities.


You. Fucking. Moron. If the price is no longer rising, *it isn't deflating.*


There's a reason anecdotes aren't permissible evidence in court: anecdotes mean nothing. But please, continue.


And...? The number of orders isn't relevant. The only thing that matters is the ratio of bitcoin spenders to total bitcoin users. I don't know about you, but 6,296 *orders* (not spenders) to the hundreds of thousands of (claimed, unsubstantiated) bitcoin users looks pretty grim to me. But then again, you also made the argument that the deflationary spiral doesn't exist because Roger got four orders per hour on the busiest bitcoin shopping day of the year on his pathetic e-shop. That horrible amount of sales (on its *best* day) would put any other business out of commission. The only reason BitcoinStore is still going is because Roger props it up with his own money. Eventually that money is going to run out. Roger knows the site is doing horribly, and that's why he no longer trumpets his sales numbers on the front page of the site.
I understand that the people here fellate you because they need "bitcoin heroes" but your dumb theories don't actually work in the real world. You're just another idiot spouting off about things that he doesn't have the slightest clue about.

I'm going to comment on this again because your comment is *that bad.* The only unjust thing here is the fact that you should be the one with the zero and the kid should have gotten the D. See, at least he turned in a paper that was legible, which is kind of a requirement for any paper. You really expected that teacher to hold your paper up to a mirror and read it that way? Well, bitcoiners are the kind of people who think people should have to trade their real money for fake money so I guess this attitude of yours isn't *entirely* surprising. 
And honestly, this kid's attitude is *kind of* understandable *because he's a kid.* You don't have that excuse. Now I say this under the assumption that the OP actually *is* a kid who turned in a terrible paper and not some dude trolling for tips.

Don't you think that by asking for USD donations instead of bitcoin donations you've already proven that you can't live for ninety days solely off bitcoins before you've even started? Why Kickstarter and not Bitcoinstarter? Don't start your "adventure" off with a lie; go all the way to only funding this through bitcoin.
And then there are your "exceptions." If you have ANY exceptions at all then you cannot live for bitcoin on ninety days. Your project is over. I'm sure you'll be just like the lady from Forbes who dismissed the fact that she was paying for a lot of stuff in USD, though. You'll just coast along somehow twisting what you're actually doing into the claim that you're actually living off bitcoins. No bitcoiner will call you out on this (much like they didn't call Forbes lady out) because they've drunk the Kool-Aid and want to believe in bitcoins so badly that they'll completely ignore any USD you spend and/or explain it away.
I'll just end by noting that calling yourself "brilliant" is extremely arrogant. You need a good dose of humility.

You're just chock full of the shitthatdidn'thappen.txt today, aren't you? The only part of that that is possibly true is the one guy refusing to accept your magic internet money. Most smart people would do the same.
As for your comment below about restaurant checks, you sound like you have never eaten at a restaurant before. The check comes, you ask the waiter/waitress to split it, then each of you pays for his/her portion with cash or a credit card. Your way of doing it adds needless complexity for no benefit.

Serious question: are you trying to help these children or indoctrinate them? Needy people need food or things that can pay for food, like USD or gift cards. What they do not fucking need at all is motherfucking bitcoins. You're not helping these people by giving them bitcoins; you are giving them homework. They do not need (and won't appreciate) homework.
If you end up doing this, I hope you get banned from the school. Fuck you, you fucking shady bitcoin-pushing piece of shit.

You'll go to a pre-trial hearing. Coinbase's lawyers will ask the judge for a summary dismissal and for you to pay Coinbase's legal fees. The judge will do so, and you'll be whisked out of the courtroom before you know what's happened. You know why?

"Why can't people acknowledge that if a particular thing actually happens, then it will have happened?" People don't go out of their way to acknowledge that because *it's common fucking sense.* I mean, seriously? "If the volatility goes away then it won't be volatile anymore." No shit, Sherlock.






This shit right here is the root of your misunderstandings of how money works. These are three extremely stupid assumptions. It would be like if I said, "Let's say every time you spend a bitcoin, a puppy dies." So no, let's not say that those stupid assumptions could be true.
This is a logical fallacy. I hear that bitcoiners like Wikipedia, so read this. This is what you are doing:


The fuck? You're making another stupid assumption. $20 may not be much but flushing it down the toilet isn't something rational people do.


Oh look, another stupid assumption. It won't happen so why incorporate it into your argument?


Because credit cards exist.


Not the agony and inconvenience of using a credit card!


It most certainly is not convenient. You know how many steps you have to go through to get and send bitcoins. No one sane is going to deal with all that, especially when everyone already has credit cards and it takes a whole five seconds to use them. And no, don't say, "Well then, let's assume anyone can get bitcoins immediately at any time." No more stupid assumptions with no basis in reality.


This one never fails to baffle me. I really want to know where bitcoiners eat lunch at where this is a thing. In developed countries, what you do is tell your server that you'd like separate checks. Then the server gives everyone individual checks with each person being billed for only what they ate/drank. Are you guys so antisocial that you can't ask your server to do this for you or what?


And yet it's stupid to do the exact opposite like you're doing. There *is* a meaning behind the saying, "don't count your chickens until they've hatched." You are Senior Chicken Counter, it appears.
Why did I waste all this time writing this and trying to educate someone who seems too dumb to understand any of it? Boredom, I guess. Well, and also so that when you lose all your damn money on this stupid shit, at least someone will have warned you.
And don't try to give me bitcoins or I will punch you through the screen. A fist will literally spring out of your monitor and knock you unconscious.

I'm still debating whether laugh or be upset when bitcoin collapses and all you stupid fucks are forced to turn to the government that you hate and ask for handouts. You are dumb as fuck.

Whatever it is will undoubtedly scar your children for life, much like you giving them their allowance in bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-26 03:12:36
Ahahahahaha, you actually believe this. You're even more deluded than I thought.
As for the teacher, he's wrong about the details but right in general. Instead of trying to prove that bitcoins are a scam, he should just say that they are stupid and then prove it by linking to this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:02:04
You're just dying to be hated by everyone you know, aren't you? (The posts from your "sister" are probably just your own sock puppet trying to make yourself look cool. Sorry, it didn't work.)
@_date: 2013-11-01 03:54:11
Hmm... let's go with the counterexamples: Reddit, WordPress, and Humble Bundle. After being badgered constantly, they added bitcoin support and almost no bitcoiners ever give them bitcoins. It hasn't been worth it for them, and it's not worth it for Wikipedia or any business that's trying to keep their doors open.
@_date: 2013-12-31 22:54:25
"Hey, you know those businesses that we keep harassing to the point that they're sick of us? Let's turn their attitude toward us from annoyance to outright hatred!"

More proof that using bitcoins is much easier than using credit cards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-09 12:33:57
BITCOIN IS IN NO WAY A PONZI SCHEME!
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:58:20
You have an odd definition of "stable." Triple-digit swings on a daily basis is about as far from stable as it gets.
@_date: 2013-06-24 10:17:59
You are fucking retarded.
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:14:52
That guy's dumbass statements ARE IN NO WAY PART OF A PUMP AND DUMP. I actually mean that; since there's no good way to dump bitcoins at this point, this is more of a pump and pump.
But no, really, look at the things the guy said and then tell me with a straight face that he's not attempting a pump and dump. He's going to feel so dumb when he realizes he can't actually cash out.
@_date: 2013-10-14 03:35:13


That's pretty clear; you're into bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:35:40
Haha, yeah, so many people use bitcoins. That "5000%+" metric doesn't matter when one of the bigger bitcoin businesses, BitcoinStore, managed a whopping four sales per hour on "Bitcoin Black Friday." Having that kind of daily sales would put most businesses (that aren't irrationally being propped up by the owner pouring personal funds into them to offset losses) out of business *very* quickly. and that's talking about *average* daily sales, not the peak sales day of the year.
Literally no one but you guys buys anything with bitcoins, and some of you never do. Time for you to get a reality check.
@_date: 2013-10-08 04:28:58
At least one of you people will admit that this is about shilling bitcoins, not the homeless. You're terrible people but at least this one is honest.
@_date: 2013-07-08 10:30:55
No one other than bitcoiners are insanely ignorant about bitcoins. It's a bad idea that is in the process of failing. It's more than a little irritating to see an idiot like you condescending to people who are smarter than you are.
@_date: 2013-08-10 04:34:11


By the way, congrats on somehow managing to insert a carriage return after nearly every word, and sometimes even in the middle of words. Bitcoiner competence shines through once again.
Edit: You're not the brightest so my point may have been lost on you. My point is this: The FDIC and NCUA are things that you may want to look into. My funds are perfectly safe in a bank or credit union whereas you see 10+ posts on this subreddit every day from people who lost all their bitcoins through some mishap, accident, or idiocy. Yeah, your money's much safer in bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-08-04 04:24:57


It's amusing that you actually believe this.
Sorry that I can't respond to everyone given the long timer I seem to be on. (It's probably some kind of Reddit "karma" bullshit but I don't know and don't care enough to find out. (Which seems to be the bitcoiner mantra about everything.)) Yes, I'm using strong language in the hope that one of you will at least think about what you're throwing your money away on. You guys talk about despising the welfare system but that's where nearly all of you are going to end up soon and I highly doubt that any of you are too proud to sign up. And the worst thing is that when that happens, I'll feel too sad for you to continue mocking you.
@_date: 2013-06-16 22:01:26
"This lets them have prices lower than amazon or newegg in most cases."
You people need to quit saying things like this because it's untrue. As far as I can see, Amazon has much lower prices than BitcoinStore the vast majority of the time and the gap will only get wider when BitcoinStore will be forced to raise their prices next month. If you keep saying things like this, at some point you're going to get in trouble for false advertising.
I advise anyone thinking of buying something from this store to do their own price checking on Amazon and come to their own conclusion.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:17:00
Wow, that sure is "a lot" of sales! You sure have shown Amazon the power of bitcoins with your whole four sales per hour. And that's your *peak*. What a fantastically heavily used currency!
You say that the whole purpose of your site is to show Amazon that they need to accept bitcoins because of "all the money they're losing" by not accepting them. Do you really expect them to take you seriously with these anemic sales numbers? Time to close it up, Roger.
@_date: 2013-08-02 10:20:33
Haha, you used "bitcoin," the "currency" of libertarians (the least charitable people in the world) and "altruism" in the same sentence. You're adorable; I want to put you in my pocket and take you home with me.
@_date: 2013-10-04 04:37:31


You guys just like to shit out whatever harebrained thought enters your minds like it's fact, don't you? If the US defaults (it won't, but I'll play into your fantasy scenario here), why the fuck would that make the USD worthless? Please, share your economic wisdom with me.
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:24:01

2. OK, I'll indulge your fantasy that you cashed out and bought a car. Please answer this:
* So... what you're saying is that the only use of bitcoins is to sell them for fiat money. I know you didn't buy that car with bitcoins.
* The bitcoin price is currently going up uP UP with no end in sight! Aren't you foolish for choosing this moment to cash out? I mean, by tomorrow, you'd have been able to buy three of those cars for that same amount of bitcoins! The answer to this is that you know that the only thing driving the price of bitcoins is speculation and it could crash spectacularly at any moment (and eventually will).
* If you cashed out over $10k at once, have fun with your upcoming audit.
You are an idiot and so is anyone else who decides to buy into this stupid shit.
@_date: 2013-09-15 03:15:12
It's run by Roger Ver, who is an ex-con and is, frankly, one of the shadiest people I've ever seen.
So obviously you should go for it!
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:40:21
It's funny that so many of you can recognize this ponzi but still fall for a slightly less obvious ponzi (bitcoins).
7800 fucking bitcoins. The Bitcoindesk ponzi guy only got, what, 40 - 50 bitcoins? Needs to up his game.
@_date: 2013-09-28 03:09:46
Almost like how any criticism of bitcoins gets downvoted in this subforum!
You guys are hilarious; please never change. :)

Hey, there's actually someone smart in this circlejerk subreddit.
@_date: 2013-07-18 10:34:57
The real question is when it'll be back to single digits. The answer is "sooner than you think."
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:23:19
Ah yes, let's use bitcoins to abuse the homeless. Brilliant plan, genius.
@_date: 2013-10-01 10:50:04
You guys are fucking idiots. :)
@_date: 2013-09-26 04:34:41
Ah yes, of course, surely *this* is what will tip the tide in favor of bitcoins! Erik, have you ever considered seeing a psychiatrist? I'd like to believe that you're just crazy instead of being as stupid as you appear to be. I know psychiatrists don't accept bitcoins and all, but you could try cashing out some of those bitcoins you got for SatoshiDice into USD. I really, really think you should do this sooner rather than later or you're only going to spiral further downward into lunacy.
You know what the great thing is? I don't even go looking for your posts; I never need to. I see a stupid thread on Reddit, click on it, and bam! You're already front and center and raving on about some nonsense or other. You really need help.
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:06:16
