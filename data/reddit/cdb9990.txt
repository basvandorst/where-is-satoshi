This is true
@_date: 2019-07-29 21:51:17
I agreee with this. But this is acting to the max.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:38:12
That currency doesn't exist anymore and Zim now uses the US dollar as its main currency . So technically. It'll be worth dollars. 
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:09:25
What a chop
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:57:08
No. You cannot. They're not accepted in Zim. It's worth absolutely nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:19:53
Yeah probably 
@_date: 2018-09-18 09:41:13
Oh. That’s even funnier then
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:41:06
If only Roger Ver didn't have any bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:38:23
@_date: 2018-09-18 09:24:45
Fuck China. Bitcoin doesn’t need China. Neither do we. Can’t believe how everyone relies on China so much. 
Getting tired of China now. If they don’t want bitcoin they can shut the fuck up and move on with their “blockchain only” ideology.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:41:50
This is nasty bro. Sharks everywhere 
@_date: 2018-09-14 21:12:10
No bro. No.

@_date: 2018-09-18 11:47:14
That’s gonna be even more bloodshed. Oh no hahaha. BTC to $200

@_date: 2018-08-15 07:49:19
No I just mean. Keep out the trash. I.e people who just want to take advantage of the pumping and even better people who do not understand what the fuck bitcoin is but blindly hand over their money to buy some. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:01:54
No it doesn’t mean that. You’re lost. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 21:13:58

@_date: 2018-08-15 00:03:46
Yes. The ETF Idea is a big fuck up. Keep it decentralized. Keep it real!
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:03:20
Geez that sucks. But I know what you mean. Can’t you pay bills with crypto is aus now? Or was that fake news. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 22:19:11
And doge. Sorry dogethereum. What nonsense
@_date: 2018-08-28 13:41:10
Probably but not because it’s “computationally expensive” but because of “manipulation”
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:33:29
I'm too stupid to understand this. Please enlighten me

@_date: 2019-03-16 06:40:13

@_date: 2019-11-06 15:48:52
He is either delusional or a genius. But so are all of us.
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:29:56
Lol I love roger. He is probably bipolar. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:51:01
Obviously this is fake news. 
@_date: 2019-11-22 19:41:56
Yup. Another way to dump the price.
@_date: 2018-10-22 20:10:58
No. It won’t change anything for the better. So stop talking shit 
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:59:01

@_date: 2018-10-06 08:16:56
����‍♂️ 
He is just upset nobody believes he is Satoshi. What a douche. 
The crypto space is becoming a joke because of these spoilt brats. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 04:27:55
Nice overlook on it all. You could be right, but we’ll have to wait and see. Think there are still many years left before bitcoin shines again 
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:02:29
No gents. Litecoin. Faster. Cheaper. Better...
@_date: 2018-06-30 15:53:43

No other way around! It's going down to 3300
@_date: 2019-12-06 14:34:51
I suppose. Was a good 2 /3 guess so far. Futures have fucked us. We won’t see 20k again. Sorry guys.
@_date: 2019-06-13 08:23:56

THIS... Only truth here
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:58:31
 I don't know who or what to believe anymore. How can we prove this?
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:48:49
Um. HSBC. GOLDMAN SACHS. HELLO. TRILLIONS. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:29:00
Lies. Shut down this website.  It might be ver. Lol
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:48:18
Wtf. We fucked. Oh well. Guess I'll be moving everything to cold storage and forgetting about crypto. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:37:48
Guys. I don't think your average Joe panic selling would even make a huge dent in btc prices. It's obviously the banksters work. Just HODL. They want cheap coin so they can manipulate it more in the future. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 21:48:51
How is crypto up? It's gone down tremendously in the last 3 days. Get real man 
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:37:42
Is this not because of the bch saga?
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:01:54
Hope it goes up soon. This pain in my loins hurts. Bought yesterday and saw a 10% drop this morning. That hurts. Lol
But this is crypto
@_date: 2018-11-12 22:10:46
Do you think the bankers care if you lose your pensions?
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:05:19
No I think he is just a spoilt man child. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:21:17
It doesn’t make sense as futures are essentially paper trades where no bitcoin is actually traded although it affects price and I think that’s all it does. Affect price
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:05:24
Lol. They’re trying too hard now. STFU
@_date: 2018-11-29 06:44:50
And down we go...
@_date: 2018-11-06 19:44:54
Cool find
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:33:54
@_date: 2018-11-13 08:14:53
It's so easy for them to create a SHORT ETF. do you honestly think that futures don't affect BTC price as much as it has? Really? Have you seen what happened to Gold, silver, coffee, virtually everything. It's so manipulated. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:27:28
Just buy dude. It's 200$. Not 2000! Make sure you don't need it though 
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:33:13
Cool. Coinbase charged you a 9.99% fee. Lol 
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:51:11
Or flash salebecause they know something we don't?
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:57:54
Yeah give it a few day s though man. This has been horrible. We might go down a bit more. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:31:50
I wouldn't buy this shit. Israelis have a habit on keeping tabs on people. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:07:17
Yeah but they develop the devices and software for these governments. They're huge in surveillance man 
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:37:02
When we hit 15k i would say this is legit
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:32:32
Just do the calçs, bro
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:08:22
Of course he sold his bitcoin man! Lol 
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:42:21
Noooooooooooo now we are fucked
@_date: 2018-11-30 10:19:13
@_date: 2018-11-29 11:21:24
I can. Back when I listened to MSm telling us its a ponzi. Now I'm a believer though. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:32:20
I think you can pay via debit card on coinbasemy man 
@_date: 2018-11-12 22:12:14
If over inflated "fake" PE goes down this is a good thing too. Banksters will use it against us. Watch. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 22:08:37
We don't need an ETF. Futures already fucked us. Just like they fucked everything else in this world. People don't want to fucking wake up.
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:28:10
You will not even mine 1 btc in 5 years using a browser and cpu or gpu. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 10:19:57
You think he deleted his account and some one made a new account 
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:29:55
Blah blah.  
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:11:46
OP means it's time to dive. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 12:46:38
Coinbase wants to charge a €18 fee on a €450 purchase via credit card. They fucking crazy. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:34:03
Fuck the fucking ETFs bro! We don't need them!
@_date: 2018-11-30 10:14:55
Don't know? Maybe he got hacked 
@_date: 2018-11-12 22:32:54
This is not good. What is they point. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:07:04
Maybe we'll be able to mine btc in a few weeks on our dell i5 laptops. I hope so. Haha
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:51:25
Well when I saw the fees I didn’t buy. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:54:44
Um. Maybe, I dunno. You could? Since you came up with the idea 
@_date: 2019-01-02 12:16:41
Lol. Don’t be a moron. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:02:50
What about Chinese new year man. People need to buy food and fire crackers for that day. They only have btc to pay with. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 07:57:26
I don't think so. Anyway that line can be drawn in shop many ways 
@_date: 2019-01-01 16:36:57
Well we’re not all from us and don’t have awesome options out there. 
I think the lowest fee I can get is 1%. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:10:46
How do you know if "most whales have dumped"?
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:37:47

@_date: 2017-09-30 23:11:34
Awesome. Shit in the US is so expensive. Lol! You must all move to africa!
@_date: 2017-09-23 06:07:39
Na. Mining not worth it. Just buy coins instead of the rig dude 
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:03:53
Just means buy more. Whenever Goldman says sell it means you must but. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 13:25:21
Yeah. I didn't finish school. You didn't grow up. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:48:18

The world will explode and we'll all be dead
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:40:02
It's not that amazing  dude. Damp squib.
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:53:42
Lies. Credit card doesn't charge anything to anyone. 
Maybe a monthly fee. That's all
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:00:10
Agreed. This post is kinda pointless in a way...
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:12:18
No bro. This will not happen soon. Don't be a clown. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:35:42
Omg in South Africa it’s about $1,5 for 95 unleaded

Just calm down my dogg! 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:01:03
Because then you should go and join the banksters
@_date: 2019-01-02 12:43:24
I said €18. Euros! That’s $20 or more. That’s insane. 
I said don’t be a moron because bitcoin is not going to 300k. Never 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:59:49
More coin. 
Trust the bankers. A lot of people are getting fired at JP Morgan this weekend. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:25:18
Maybe if you have the cash lol 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:30:10
If Goldman says sell. You must buy!

I agree with you bro. I think they’re the ones who bought in December and are offloading now. Slowly. 
They’re clever as fuck. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:12:40
I thought he was a holder. Now after the crash he apparently sold. Fuck these guys are Bullshit.  I say sell when they say buy. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:09:59
Haha. Tell a guy who is down 80% not to sell man. People don't have control...
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:59:49

Trust the bankers. A lot of people are getting fired at JP Morgan this weekend. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:50:20
Yeah I’m sure at some point in our lives we all thought about it. Don’t think it should be about money though at all!!
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:34:02
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:27:12
The FUD will not stop until Wall Street owns 20 million BTC. Coz right now they can't really manipulate too much. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:26:54
I thought he loved crypto. Wtf
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:33:17
Why 12000. You won't get there without going down again. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:50:36
Haha this is great 
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:48:48
This is just fud. Maybe not. But it is really bad news for crypto. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:55:38
Oh yeah. Time to short 
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:32:00

@_date: 2017-09-01 10:48:38
What a pumper. Thinks we are stupid. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:22:27
Bro. How do we (the normal folk) perform atomic Swaps.
Exchanges are afraid because they will lose exchanging charges/fees. So they'll lose business. That's why they're Afraid. But we still need to the change Fiat to crypto.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:39:18

@_date: 2017-10-04 21:36:31
Roger Ver is a big fanatic. Type of guy that would kill bitcoin haters if he could and justify it by saying they're liars..lol

@_date: 2017-10-01 06:06:08
Beer here is cheap when compared to anywhere in the world. Maybe $2 a pint.. And we have the biggest brewery in the world. Or used to be and is now bought over.

Hmm interesting. You didn't answer the question. But maybe you did...
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:03:26
Dude. I honestly don’t want to spread FUD. but ever since CME bitcoin futures launched its been a one way street. So much more manipulation. I will also keep buying. But I don’t think we will see ath for a very long time.
@_date: 2019-09-30 20:31:49
Please enable 2FA. That’s all from me.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:55:26
Won’t happen now bro. It’s over for another year
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:53:23
It's possible. Although I think these last few months have definitely had a psychological effect on holders. 
@_date: 2019-09-23 09:06:02
This is it. I just hope we can overcome this.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:55:58

Articles like this just make me buy more 
@_date: 2018-04-01 22:17:28
Not true. People have internet. Just don't think they care about bitcoin. They're more interested in buying a meal for the day. 
Only the rich but bitcoin.  To get their money out of Africa 
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:07:14
