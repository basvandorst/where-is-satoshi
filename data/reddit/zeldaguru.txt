Yeah, I would've gone that route if it was a Linux host, but it's BSD for now.
The alternative was jails, but I didn't feel like setting up all the toolchains to build everything for BSD and took the lazy VM way.
Once I run into performance issues, I'll consider switching; though I'd prefer a situation where BTC is so valuable that I could run the nodes on their own hardware in my personal data-center.
Thanks for the thoughts, though.

Not to be picky, but you can't claim that both BU and no one says no scaling options should be made beyond blocksize limit increases.
Sure, 'infinite' blocksizes might be it's demonstrably bad *IF* blocks are constantly being filled beyond what economic nodes can support; I still don't see anyone claiming to want to do that. It seems that the economics of the situation handles it (usually in the form of orphan blocks and social pressure).

Woah woah woah. Chill out. 
First, I own on both chains.
Second, I'm not going to just give out my personal info just to satisfy your curiosity. I don't really care if an anon redditor believes me and I don't really care to be DDoS'd again for running certain software.
Third, I don't close a blind eye to tech just because of dogma.
Fourth, as I originally mentioned, thin blocks takes care of a lot of the bandwidth issues; so no, it's not really prohibitive to run that many nodes on a home connection.
Fifth, I don't have gigabit fiber yet, but I can say that this is all running behind a 300/20 connection, not throttled but w/ QoS so it doesn't cause latency *IF* it manages to saturate my connection, which it currently doesn't.

I'd like to see them talk about governments' ability to regulate, tax, and freeze assets, particularly for on-chain vs off-chain solutions.

As I said previously, it runs stripped down Debian VMs so it's just a beautiful bash-colored console. Second to that, it's a headless machine.
I never claimed my case/hardware was typical, just that it wasn't as expensive as OP tried to claim. In my line of work, a $1500 machine is dirt cheap, even for personal use. It would seem that someone who has been in Bitcoin for a while could easily afford it by now as it is up 4x just since the beginning of this year.
 
Realistically, I don't expect the typical user to run any bitcoin node (as per the white paper), much less 4 of them.

So we are just supposed to ignore that Compact/Thin Blocks exists? 
Even if you want to argue that Thin Blocks is bad, surely Core's Compact Blocks (BIP152) solves the propagation situation for blocksize limits that are many multiples higher than the 1MB limit?
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:05:00
It's not. 4MB is the worst case max size where transactions are heavy in signatures (or are being crafted to fill the signature space). Expected average segwit block size is between 1.7MB - 2.1MB.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:28:32
I'm not confused, you've completely ignored what I said and went partially in an orthogonal direction. My only conjecture was that no one is saying that raising the blocksize limit is the only thing that should/could happen.
I read the paper when it came out. Does it not bother you that your source says IBLT would allow for dramatic increases in the blocksize limit? Compact blocks confers those benefits.

I actually run 4 nodes (Core, BU, Classic, ABC) in separate VMs using spare resources on my $1500 home NAS; it's really nowhere near as resource intensive as you want to claim.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:05:57
current load average: 4.10 7.60 6.70
A NAS is just what the machine is currently used for, which is why I gave a dollar amount. The hardware itself is mostly repurposed datacenter parts. 24 core Xeon, 40gb ram, 30TB of WD Reds using ZFS (those were new but I got them for a steal). 
Each VM is using about 4-15% cpu, depending on when blocks come in. The VMs themselves run bare Debian.

Curious. I'm not saying you are wrong, but at what point yesterday (8/24) were you waiting for 2 hours on a BCH transaction? It started pushing &gt;20 blocks/hr a couple of hours before midnight that day.

Self-evident truth about infinity is not really a great point...
I've yet to see anyone (who wasn't trolling) say that only the blocksize limit should be increased and no further improvements should be made. Link me if you have proof otherwise.

:O  Thanks friend! I hope your cable works out.
I find that mobile Trezor use (even just futzing about) is a good way to encourage people to ask what's going on, which naturally leads to spreading the Good Bitcoin News. I've gotten friends/family in this way.

I do exactly this with my Nexus 6p. This OTG cable works for me:

I believe you mean addresses not wallets, as that is what the fees are paid on. Address reuse has been a no-no for a while for privacy reasons for both the sender and receiver.
