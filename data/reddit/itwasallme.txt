It’s roger ver behind this, if his willing to abuses admin powers on sites and lookup certain customers information to win a argument on the Internet back then for 50bucks lol.
If his that low, how low you think he go to win bigger arguments.

I didnt throw all my bitcoin cash in the bin, good to make money with the pump and dump. Its the boost t o the pocket.
But i dont favor in the long run coins that trick people, try to attack and steal branding of other coins.
That is toxic. The more people who see these wars, is what going to be the end of crypto market to the public.
Bitcoin cash should show some dignity and earn its reputation by what it has to offer then run after the shadows of bitcoin.

Im invested in both, btc more but bitcoin cash need to stop deception and bias.
Get a new name and a new .com site instead of trying to confuse new users, show what you can achieve instead of looking towards bitcoin to get some attention.
Your setting the crypto world of many coins a step back playing these kid games.
