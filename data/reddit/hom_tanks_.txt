i didn't mean that. i don't think he has an extreme opinion JUST because it differs from a lot of other bitcoin enthusiasts.
i just wanted to say that he has an pretty extreme standpoint (wanting to abolish the state) and while many bitcoin enthusiasts will not agree with him, i still think people like him are important for crypto and for getting us to discuss.

While not everyone should be that extreme in his opinions and missions, we definitely need someone like him in the spectrum. we need to discuss those things even though not everyone might agree with him.
and we need developments like the dark wallet even though many people might never use it. just to spark important discussions about bitcoin and crypto.

Here we go (it's not super accurate but i tried to maintain the original meaning):
*As media experts we know: It's Christmas time again. It's charity time again. So Christmas is coming soon and for 2 to 3 weeks we should think about the people we don't give a shit about for the rest of the year.*
*Africa... the magical country south of Europe. But the children in Africa don't have anything. Especially now, at Christmas time. We can change that.*
*ZDF Neo supports the charity "Bitcoins for Africa". Join us. Help Africa.*
*... can we put some different clothes on both children? So it looks a little more authentic?...*
*You can make a difference. Help us. Support "Bitcoins for Africa". Scan the QR Code appearing on your screen and transfer your bitcoins for Africa to our digital wallet.*
*Do you.. do you know what a QR-code is? Bitcoin for Africa... support us.*
*Here children: This is for you. These are bitcoins... for you. Take it.* 
etc. etc.

Get a 5$ VPS from  and set it up using this tutorial: 
you should be running a full node in a matter of minutes. well, excluding the time it takes to download the blockchain of course. 
In the future 20GB SSD might not be enough for the blockchain, but it's enough for now.
