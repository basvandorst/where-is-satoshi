Don't invest money you can't afford to lose in bitcoin. This is my "math" 
Not exactly scientific I'll admit, but I've done fairly well with it so far.

An issue for now, but eventually everyone will just be using BTC directly. No need for conversion either way then. Those who hold their coins until that time will do much better than those who held dollars.
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:32:52
Given that bitcoin is global and decentralized, any government attempting to restrict the use of bitcoin would likely only be harming itself. I can imagine such a campaign being even less effective ultimately than the war on drugs or on p2p sharing.

Pretty sure what you're describing was Bitcoin, but you can start another chain if you like.

BTC is to GOLD as LTC is to PYRITE; BTC is to MSFT as LTC is to IPET.

You are correct. I think it is likely the price will fall to $7 before any more meaningful rise occurs. Just speculating in a speculation thread.

If your child is kidnapped by terrorists and you pay the ransom, you are guilty of funding a terrorist organization. If the bank is aware, they may be complicit. Of course IANAL.

Just my intuition. I called the top of the first bubble at $32, and unfortunately just missed cashing out big. Called the bottom at $3, and did pick up some cheap coin there. The actual bottom was about $1.80 I think. I called the top of this bubble at $44. Obviously underestimated somewhat.
This is the first public prediction I've made, and it likely won't be realized for a number of months. Feel free to ignore it, I may well be spectacularly wrong. Long term I am still bullish, but on the order of 6+ years.

Your VM is always at the mercy of the host OS, so you're not adding security by doing this. At best a VM will prevent a security breach from reaching the host.

One would hope, but I don't think the law is known for being particularly flexible. [Section 83.03b]( seems to only require knowledge.
@_date: 2013-09-30 00:42:44
This seems like a really good deal, but I only have 3BTC. Obviously the ROI is much better if you send the 5BTC, if someone can loan me the extra 2BTC, I will pass back 50% of the profit! NO RISK!

You are thinking way too small. Here's what you should do:
1. Sell your house and all your posessions.
2. Sell your children into slavery.
3. Murder your parents to collect the insurance money.
4. Get as many credit cards as you can.
5. Put it all into Bitcoin.
Soon you will be living like a king.

Trading is a zero-sum sum game, so the average will be twice the negative fee of the particular exchange. Good luck.

Anybody with a brain knows you're better off just buying as much as you can and holding forever.

First you need to tell us why you think bitcoin would need actual anonymity to gain traction.

I'm buying as much as I can, as everyone would be well advised to do.
