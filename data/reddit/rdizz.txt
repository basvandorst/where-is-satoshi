outstanding, i love stories like this
@_date: 2014-02-24 13:11:36
I have had them in there since they were less than $80. I did split up my funds into other places but gox had most of it. 
I remember hearing there was a little drama with them a while back but thought nothing of it, until recently when I found out what was really going on, and by then it was too late to get it back. 
I should have known better than to store online but it's too late now and I must pay for my stupidity. I have no expectation that I will ever see my bitcoins again.

So there is still a small chance I will get my money back?
@_date: 2015-10-18 10:28:56
ouch.  Sometimes when I hear stories like that I feel the kind of sympathy I have for people who have suffered the a death of a loved one. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 06:32:31
Well I will admit that it was not an amazing act, it wasn't bad enogh for me to stop watching before the end. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:40:30
it is, these "investors" piss me off. Buy bitcoins and use them for the purpose they were created not to try and make a quick buck.

@_date: 2013-11-11 03:12:39
me too, im still buying though
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:05:06
selling now or any time within the next 6 months is going to be a bad idea. HOLD FAST. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:23:29
scroll down this page and on the right side you will come to a link for bitcointip. everything is in there
@_date: 2013-08-26 22:27:15
Well I called out this one about 3 months ago and got downvoted like a champion. Anyway this is still a good sign for the future of btc

I bought 2 btc when they were about $12 and didnt really know what to do with them but I really liked the concept of bitcoins so I ended up leaving them in the US mtgox. I watched them die a little and kind of gave up on btc just hoping one day they would crack $30. I would look every few months at my account that had hardly changed. Then today by chance I saw this thread burried way down my FP feed here and thought "No fucking way, this has  to be a april fools joke" 
So I checked my MtGox account and bam there are my 2btc chilling for $105 each
Even though its not a bad amount im still kicking myself that I never bought more. 
Thank you Bitcoins and I honestly hope you change tbe world.
also I kind of hope they drop below $30 agakn so I can buy up! am I an asshole? ,)

yeah I support Bitcoin and its idea (been around since they were $10) and I like reddit but this sub is fucked up. Is there a place I can go where all the non investors can hang out and actually talk about the currency and its uses and places to spend it?
This place is a cancer to the currency. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:34:50


I had no idea? can you provide a link or something about that? 
I have no conficts with either from FF or scripts running on them. Seems normal and safe otherwise.
edit: I did a search and found out, thanks I did not know.

While this looks bad wouldn't this be bitcoin business suicide for any merchant that used it because no one (with half a brain) will get on board with them and exclude them from trading? 
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:19:11
there is an Australian isp now accepting btc
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:28:07
While that is cool, the title of this thread is totally misleading. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:40:12
So why don't we all reply with something positive to get that comment pushed down?
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:41:01
I just have to say this, You all just need to fucking relax. This is social economics 101, we will always have enemies and people against bitcoin try their hardest to ruin the system and our way of doing things. Even if this coin validation made it onto the market it's up to us, the users to control how big it would get. 
Which is nowhere because for bitcoin merchants it would be business suicide to take it on board. No one would support that business and would never spend btc at a place that uses such a destructive system, plus the business would get a instant bad reputation for using it.  It's bizzare that people even thought coin validation had a chance. 
The value of btc and its uses are on the constant rise and will continue without doubt. People are still buying like crazy all over the world before it becomes too expensive and the btc market is exploding in China.  
Downvote me all you want, I copped it from you guys 6 months ago for saying similar things but I was correct. We run this as a collective,  it is how it works. The future of bitcoin is completely in our hands, no single man or company will have the ability to control it unless we all let them.

Amazing generosity. Good to see people using bitcoins for somethig other than eazy access online gold. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 05:51:14
