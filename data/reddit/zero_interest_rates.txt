[Bitcoin's "Metcalfe's Law" relationship between market cap and the square of the number of transactions](
@_date: 2015-12-26 18:01:24


That's not what he said... at all.  Here's what he said:  
*"Go read Satoshi's first announcement of Bitcoin on the cryptography list. The very first question ever is about scalability and he states quite clearly that he thought about it extensively and it would never be an issue in practice. He uses Visa as an example to illustrate his point.
Now go read the Lightning white paper. They also use Visa as an example and state that Bitcoin cannot scale. They directly contradict Satoshi on literally the first Bitcoin topic ever discussed.
So I am not speaking for Satoshi in my post above: I am pointing out that he strongly disagreed with Poon &amp; Dryja's reasoning right from day one.
As you can see above, Joseph uses the same language some of the other Bitcoin Core folks use ... they like to say "our understanding is much better now". They do not like to explain exactly what this "better understanding" actually is, given that computers haven't got any slower. They just assert that it could never work. That's unfortunate."*  
You can agree or not, but saying he said "Satoshi was against it" is a little offbase, isn't it?
@_date: 2015-12-24 14:04:02


yup, we've had all of this too... Gox, Cryptsy (soon), etc.  The thing is, here, no bailouts allowed.  
@_date: 2015-12-24 14:35:07




that's why, isn't it?

That is cool.  I'm sorry I've dismissed you.  My concerns were everyone that posted a good tweet ending up posting it here too.

WHOA!  I used this website, but it seems to fluctuate all over the place:    
Watch for some minutes and it goes up and down like crazy.  
Agree with everything you say.

yeah that's why everyone hates block-stream bro
@_date: 2016-02-21 16:54:24
We're now around ~80% full; what happens when we get to %110?  
* Posts about tx not processing 
* Posts about "where is my bitcoin? Did I lose all the money?"
* After a while, posts saying the system is broken.  
* Probably a crash in price, like the Gox disasters---but now the problem isn't some stupid exchange, it's the protocol, it's bitcoin itself.  
I feel the pain *will be* very, very high; and people will be selling all the way through the hardfork threat.

I'll give you a hint:  
i) look at the number of followers  
ii) look at who submitted this 
@_date: 2016-02-21 20:44:12
which, in my perspective, means a panic bigger than mtgox is probably coming...

BitcoinXT isn't there
@_date: 2015-09-14 16:46:11
Same here, /. in 2010.  Then taught a class the very same day, reading the wikipedia and /. article.  People thought I was nuts.  
Then left it out of my radar for some months.  But dolar parity came; the $30+ bubble came, then price collapsed; then wired went full retard and proclaimed the death of bitcoin.  
I had such a visceral response to wired's article I started buying---large scale, that very same day.  I had GPU mined 13 for a while and already understood it.  From there to buy it outright was a smooth transition.  
You know what?  I think I should give some to slashdot.  
@_date: 2015-09-29 17:09:39
nope, perhaps because Google had a product.
@_date: 2015-09-20 12:53:53
Much more, as you'd at least have to mine 6 *consecutive* blocks 
@_date: 2015-09-17 14:50:59
nope, the opposite.   Unclear wording, yes; but you got the point.
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:18:31
And I suppose you don't even know what super-exponential growth is, but that's OK.  
You must be new here.

I really really hated that obituary... it was my visceral response to it that made me start buying...
@_date: 2015-09-29 17:15:52
their product was already kicking altavista, askjeeve's, etcs, ass by 2000
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:55:55
They did not?  Then save the prior art, perhaps stamp it to the blockchain, and give it to the community when patent challenge time arrives.  For now... they did all of it...  
Fucking coinbase robbers...
@_date: 2015-09-20 13:57:02
Awesome; thanks!
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:23:44
We have BIP 101 ready and compiled.   
Let's get the community back together again. 
Let's let the network effects in.  
Let's have organic growth again.  
Fuck blockstream and censorship.
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:25:22
It's very interesting that they are going directly to the core-devs of the 2 major chains, isn't it?  
Is that done, by, say, xapo.com?  
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:01:14
yeah; twitter is great for free speech.
@_date: 2015-09-29 17:14:01
How can people paranoid about decentralization become so complacent regarding this centralization of devs?  
@_date: 2015-09-20 13:01:21
@_date: 2015-09-29 02:52:15
Szabo wants a settlement network for big money.  
Hmm.. great... until you understand that without network effects and Metcalfe's law, there will never be big organic growth in value.  People on the long tail will drop out and feel scammed.  
That's not what Satoshi intended, is it?  
I expect to be downvoted to oblivion, if not banned...
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:39:11
Because their product is selling like hotcakes?  Oh yeah they never made a single sale--maybe because they have no product to sell.
The question you must ask is why doesn't xapo, coinbase, 21, or bitpay do the same?  Why is blockstream going for this centralization of devs?  
@_date: 2015-09-23 11:40:58
there never will be
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:43:25
I've taken a look...  but just what am I supposed to be seeing?  
The fact that there's clearly prior art to all their bullshit?  I guess threads like these wouldn't be needed if were to come clean on his BS.  
And Oh....  I can't be bought.  I have way too much btc at stake already--and that's why I support BIP 101.
Fuck coinbase and fuck @_date: 2015-09-29 17:07:07
nope, Twitter is really great; check out the new guy in there just today, 
@_date: 2015-09-29 06:40:53


nice way to put it.
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:51:42


Yes, it is, and these douchebags need to be challenged in court.  
Not that these particular patents would ever stand on their merits, though, there is such an enormous amount of prior art that all that coinbase has to offer is a fucking joke.  And **yes**, I am indeed writing this for the **investors in coinbase** to see how much they have fucked up believing in these douchebags.

* LN doesn't exist; so far it's vaporware;  
* LN needs a hardfork &amp; a solution to tx-malleability;   
* LN is brought to you by a corp, rather like paypal, and is likely to see the same problems;   
* Security is **hard**; we need years of LN running to have some trust on it.  Remember when anyone could spend anyone else's bitcoin?  **Security is hard.**

@_date: 2015-10-03 16:10:15
well, I see one side censoring debate and the other side taking the heat; pretty easy to decide here, especially when the ones the the heat are going along the original vision from satoshi that I signed up for.
