Don't think you'll find many pro traders just doing bitcoin. 1) its unregulated 2. Its relative low liquidity. 3. Its not mainstream.
I trade BTC, but it is just one market of a few I am in (indexes and currencies much more so).
In time am sure this will change though.

Its not bad, nor is it any riskier than being long ( provided you use correct risk control strategies). It is a trading direction that you can enter and risk control with a loss exit (just the same as a long position).
How do you sell something you don't own? Essentially you are borrowing it from another party. Just think of buying and selling in reverse order that is short selling. It is a normal market transaction.

Buy and hold is investing. Bots are usually short term trading and more risky. They are different. Take a small part of your bitcoin stash and investigate bots. cryptotrader.org is worth a look, lots of different bots and exchanges, plus build your own bot capability.

I would say everybody fears of personal responsibility, and Bitcoin supporters are not different from Bitcoin skeptics here. We all strive to safety and stability, and that's very human. I would argue that, opposite to the fear of responsibility stand the fear of authority..  
However, the example of reaching an understanding with your dad is a good one when each of you overcomes some barrier and goes beyond your comfort zone in some way. Bitcoin is indeed a wonderful invention, but it's not a solution to everything. At least not now.
