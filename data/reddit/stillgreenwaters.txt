There was a post over on the forum earlier from guy who had discovered the server the attack was launched from in vietnam. He had taken the database by a mysql injection and a list of usernames or emails or something. I think they deleted it because I went to have a look for it again I couldn't find it.

It wasn't anything else. I've read some other posts about people having problems with similar cards and coming to the same conclusion. pci-e 1 slots should be compatible with pci-2.1 cards and most are but a few are not.

can you tell me how check how much money flowed through the deposit address they gave me or would that process be very complicated?

Cheers, that was easy. Another quick question if you don't mind. Would it be at all possible to get the wallet with the deposit address they used for me? I would like to be able to own that address as it is an early one.

I didn't see it. I figure I'll try and pick up an old mobo too if I see one going cheap. Which one worked out for you?

The bios is up to date. [Other]( people have the same problem. It's not the PSU and a bios update won't fix it. They just aren't compatible. It might be that the board uses an nvidia chipset. I'm just wondering if anyone has any ATI card that works with it. There might be one.
