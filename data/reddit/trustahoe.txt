Well it makes transactions for this year much easier.
Especially as LN gets implemented, I was happy to see my 1.5 BTC move in 15 minutes for a 10 dollar fee.
Improvements are coming on the number 1 cryptocurrency. BTC doesnt have any major competitors other than ETH. Which IMO, is a fantastic crypto that I'd be okay with growing.
No IOTA/TRON/DOGE/shitcoin pump and dump.

That's the value of Bitcoin. A hedge against fiat currency.

I think about the inevitable distribution of bitcoin amongst the population. 
I bought years ago and want to HODL all of my bitcoin, but I need the money for some life investment. Will be selling almost 25% and I hope to stick and not sell until 100k and 1m/coin. Those were my two goals. 
Guess my point is, we are all here because many people lost their bitcoin masses.

Honestly got lucky picking a great profession and SO. 
But this doesnt answer the question. HODL. Duh? At least when I bought crypto, you bought it to trade with each other, not back to USD. The fact that USD has obtained crazy value for it, that's a benefit these new people are seeing.

Just another alt coin, a particularly bad one when things like Ethereum and Ripple have significantly more support/infrastructure.

Anyway, hard forks suck. You are talking to a person with multiple bitcoin stuck in exchanges without access to bitcoin cash

I took a half day yesterday to figure out how to convert Bitcoin Cash to anything (from coinbase).
Thank god I didnt give up, sold at 4,000 to some noobs/idiots.

hit the send button on coinbase. That lets you send crypto.
No opinion on those wallets.
Getting alt coins requires bitcoin or ethereum. Go on an exchange, polonix and binance are popular.
If you go with wallets, you could use shapeshift, but i had a bad experience with high fees on that. I'm still profitable though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:22:16
After another bitcoin Hard Fork, new bitcoin owners were fooled into an Alt-Coin pump and dump scheme. These bitcoin forks are dubbed 'shitcoins'.
As a result, when coinbase allowed access to 'shitcoins' for 4,000, people sold like crazy, which created massive chaos amongst things like insider trading and loss of faith in coinbase.
Due to the shitcoin, the user thinks trust for digital currency has been lost.
HODL folks.

Curious thoughts if


Do I need a cash Emergency Fund?


At 10% APR, should I be paying off credit card debt or waiting for bitcoin to go up? Its only a 100-200$ a month fee, but bitcoin has traditionally done better than 10% a year.
So I have 150k, 20k credit card debt. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:18:59
Why is this so hard for people to understand?
Also, back in my day(libertarian bitcoin dominance), you bought bitcoin to trade for people accepting bitcoin. Not USD.
Sure we did the USD estimation, but you wanted the bitcoin, not the USD.
It seems the other way around right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:43:36

Bitcoin cash is just another alt coin.
Ethereum and ripple are doing bitcoin cash better than bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:46:08
The problem is the forks are outdated.
Bitcoin is rare, the 100 forks are not rare.
Alt coins are not rare, but they do exactly what bitcoin was intended to do. I keep my bitcoin because its the first and its rare. We hope that solutions make moving crypto's gold cheaper, but the future for quick transactions will be in alt coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:00:56
Why? Litecoin is going to have the same problems as bitcoin with log jams.
Ethereum and other alts actually have leadership. Litecoin is leaderless.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:59:57

Here are a vast number of reasons why:








Idk, I feel like I can come up with more reasons. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:37:18
I did this the moment coinbase gave me access to my BCash. 
Unfortuantly had to turn to litecoin since ethereum was at risk of getting jammed.
Changed to litecoin asap and got out at 4k! Was a heck of a 2 hour frantic figure it out situation, but made an extra few thousand!

@_date: 2017-12-15 00:02:12
Opposite story:
Phone broke, 2 step didn't work.
Locked out of account
Needed money to pay credit card.
20% interest on credit card.
OMG 20% interest on credit card....
Bitcoin goes from 7000 to 16000.
So that paid for the interest...
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:32:46
During the Coinbase BCH dump, I wanted to sell at 4k but coinbase restricted sales for the first day.
I took my BCH wallet and shapeshifted 3BCH it to LTC at 4k. 
The bad news is that LTC dropped 25% vs bitcoin, and I will never trust alt coins to hold value again. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:08:36
This person doesnt do anything with their life.

When you own one, the ratio never changes. With USD it does. With gold it slightly does.
Sure a mutual fund has more value, but you are charged fees on mutual funds.

I easily will say Bitcoin. I'm curious if you think any fiat is better despite it constantly performing worse.

I dont disagree. All Cryptocurrency is a zero sum, which is why this alt-coin mania will cause much pain.
However, Bitcoin is significantly better than Fiat because of inflation. Between the US, Venezuela, Zimbabwae, South Korea, someone is printing more money. People have figured out Bitcoin is scarce, and Fiat is not.
This drives the value up compared to Fiat.
