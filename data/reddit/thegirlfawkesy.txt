Yes guys, being friendly to girls is why bitcoin isn't mainstream yet. Clearly further male to female friendliness is the key to adoption...

There is already a new subreddit in the works that abides by the reddit rules and has many many prominent regulars as mods. It will be unveiled in a few days if we can't make any progress with the alpha-mods

They can change their minds, they could have allowed us to exist with new moderation/principles or they could choose to ban a new subreddit even if it wasn't operated by the same people nor had any referrals. 
They did and they have. Reddit mods run reddit and they have every right to decide that the new GGB will not exist. While the new GGB didn't break the rules they stated were violated in the old one, they just banned it a moment ago and they have every right to do so, this is their house. 
In regards to the remaining comments, at the time of the initial message I had literally zero idea why it had been banned. The ban message suggested it was possibly automatically performed. 
I wrote in a playful fun way simply because I wasn't too concerned with there being a problem. I wasn't being passive aggressive, I was honestly just joking around and writing in a fun style as is the general climate of the site. 
If you had managed to read the new subreddit before it was banned it was stated all over the place that there would be no referrals, that it would be modded by well known members of the community, and that once it was set up properly I was going to hand it off to other people to run it. There was no intent on breaking any rules or backsliding at all. We made it quite clear that was not going to happen and offered a new degree of transparency along with my apologies for what I had previously done wrong. 
Its unfortunate that we won't have the opportunity to do things better in the future but that's the choice of Reddit's admins and they have every right to do that. I have no complaints or issues with this at all. I expected it might even happen. This is their house and they set the rules.

It has a similar name, currently its accessible only to the mods. It will be made public once its ready. We're not going to have this blow up in our faces again, there will be a lot more democracy in how it's run.

Thank you Yorrick, I think "smart tramp" suits me just fine.

I don't think I've ever claimed that my posts on GGB made me classy. To be honest I find it as a nice outlet for the kind of behavior I fantasize about in real life but can't actually do due to having to behave in a classy way 99% of the time in my life. 
As I've said before you are clearly not a fellow of infinite jest Yorrick.

Please do. Please.

I'm hoping that the alpha-mods smile upon it rather than smite it due to the changes that have been made. Once everything is all set up again I'll be stepping down as one of the mods as was their wishes.

I'm not a victim at all. I screwed up as a mod and they banned us. Simple as that. Totally my fault. 
I'm hoping now that everything has been changed and fixed that does not carry over to a totally new group of mods and people who will be running it.
