Andreas is a smart guy but I seriously doubt you need the government or secret infiltrators to come in to create different factions in this community. All you need is a healthy dose of Ego and the refusal to listen to the other side.  
BTC will probably be overtaken by new efficient tech because it's impossible to use. Andreas wants to say how it's going to help all the starving people in Africa have bank access. Meanwhile, even with the fastest computers I can't get BTC to an exchange quickly without paying an enormous fee. How the hell are they gonna use this technology to buy rice in a village somewhere?

The human mind is finally starting to see that divisions between people via nations, economies, religions, ethnicities, etc creates endless conflict. Bitcoin is only the inevitable result of the human mind thinking beyond these artificial and long standing divisions. It is not the cause, but rather the effect of that shift in perception.

I would like to see a service where someone can tip an artist, and after the tip is collected, the artist can have a URL automatically sent to the tipper. The URL might be a "Thank you!, come join my facebook page!" or, a link to their blog, Youtube clips, amazon product page, etc. 
It would give artists more incentive to use changetip/bitcoin and changetip could also be used to buy other products from the artist.

I don't mind at all if they think the blockchain is separate from bitcoin. In fact, to try and correct the misunderstanding is simply aiming a gun at our own feet.

Even better are the dreams where it spikes suddenly to 3k and you can't get into your exchange to sell a few. Then it plunges way down to the 50s and you can't buy any either. I have those once every few months.

I've been through a few bubbles with BTC. Had orders set all the way down to 900 friday, most got filled. I'm very bullish long term, but short term I think we may have another test of 1000. Just holding right now and waiting for dips. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 01:58:16
up now
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:23:53
Not laughing, buying
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:25:13
I'm in the same boat - I made sure I put orders in at $800 just to be sure. I hope they are still there just in case
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:51:48
hope you also had (have) some limit orders below 1100. Already went below that on GDAX this am.
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:44:23
I thought I controlled it. When I buy, the price goes down - when I sell, it goes up. They should interview me about it. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:22:32

Actually, that is exactly what happened yesterday. The ETF was shot down and the fearful newbies sold off. Veterans became greedy and bought. There are many more veterens now. I'm sure many newbies bought back as they saw the recovery and won't make the same mistake again. The bull run isn't over at all.   
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:08:44
GDAX down and Coinbase too, just great
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:48:17
sorry, I don't think there are sell stops on Gemini, that's on GDAX. But to buy at 1000, set a limit order there for the amount of BTC you want. You have to have enough USD on the exchange for the limit order. Good Luck!

He doesn't understand the bigger idea of decentralization through computer technologies. Bitcoin and the whole decentralization movement will only grow from now on. The IOT will be the big change. Older people in comfy, salaried positions aren't going to see this so easily. Doesn't matter though, these ideas won't die. 
For the Record, BTC price was around $240 at the time. Just about the bottom of the current bull market.

The naysayers on this forum have to remember that gold has been going down with all the financial crises while the Honeybadger has been going up.

@_date: 2015-07-27 21:56:28
No difference at all in theory, but when I pay bills with a credit card (which is damn often) I have the satisfaction of knowing that I'm buying btc as well. It just feels different. Also, because I buy btc more frequently through the app, the fluctuations in price are not so problematic. I like it, others maybe not. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 15:28:06
The Nasdaq exchange is interested in using bitcoin. Is it that far fetched to think large banks don't notice that?

You have enormous subconscious societal beliefs about money and ownership being challenged by Bitcoin. You can't expect people to move into B right away by saying "this is better for you". If that were possible, you could tell a depressed person "just think happy thoughts - it's better for you". Subconscious beliefs take time to change most of the time - especially on a societal level.

I think B has a more than decent chance at succeeding, but when you lose half your savings over a year, pulling the trigger on larger buys is psychologically difficult. However, I do love my lawnmower app. I bought at least $100 worth through that since the 220's and will continue to buy more that way....

@_date: 2015-07-27 21:09:10
Yeah, it rounds up the spare change on your cc card, multiples it up to 5x if you like, and then deposits the btc into your lawnmower wallet on coinbase. For me, it's a far easier way to collect btc and somewhat easier to swallow bills like my insane health insurance.

Add some more zeros and get used to it
@_date: 2015-07-05 16:17:05
The price will move either way. A NO vote would send others in fragile economies to consider buying btc as hedge against future capital controls. A YES vote would mean the Greeks will have money from the banks to spend on btc and keep away from the future default. Honeybadger will eat well regardless.

Advertisers pay lots of money to Madison ave to get their products in front of people on TV and the internet.

I'd rather bitcoin payments go to people who are going to hold bitcoin, or sell less for fiat. The bitpay merchants just dump bitcoin for dollars, thus keeping the price down. 
Bitcoin may not go to mega corporations, but individuals like myself who offer large discounts for bitcoin payments and hold bitcoin for savings. If it becomes the little man's payment system, I'm all for it.

that's true, but if a band makes 50 dollars in tips from bitcoin, can they use that towards a trip purchase on expedia? I don't think so. it's either pay everything in BTC or pay everything with paypal or CC card. 
That's why I'd like to see virtual coupons. I could buy a trip with a CC card, but then use a virtual coupon (from bitcoin tips) for a discount. It's not a bad way to get people interested in more bit tips.

Maybe local bitcoins could add a service like this? Pay cash plus a premium for safely delivering bitcoin to the ransomware. I'm sure many people don't want to have a bitcoin wallet, learn to send it, etc. They just want the files back. Could be a nice service through local bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-11 00:14:41
Right now I think we're in wave 4 (retracement wave), if we drop to 1500 -1700, that could be a good area for the beginning of wave 5. But hey, let's see what happens. I don't think 3000 was the end of the current market cycle. I think we at least get to 5000 after the drama is over this fall.

In the future, there will be a way to buy an acre of farmable land with bitcoin and also have the title legally handed over with proof in the blockchain. All the legalities will be at the touch of a button, with no international lawyers needed and there will be worldwide consensus that this piece of land now belongs to X. So is that more valuable than an acre of farmable land? Probably in the future, yes.

If there were a service which converted bits into virtual coupons, then tipping bits would be more useful. Bands are always buying more gear, needing hotels, needing gas, etc. Bitcoin could help with all that for a start.

Absolutely. Micropayments is also the answer to get more people spending. I'm hesitant to spend $5000 for something with bitcoin right now because I'm betting the same amount of BTC will be worth $6000 within the year. However, the difference between 50 and 60 cents makes no difference to most sane people. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:13:30
This may be a stupid question, but could a payment business be built around this? In other words, you pay some online service which pays the hacker for you, you don't have to buy bitcoins - they have them and send them for you for an extra 10 percent?
