Why be interested when most of it is scams?
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:14:00
Whau big boy trade.
Respect ��
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:16:46
Best place is in your wallet. It never lies though it may hurt a little bit today. No worries just HODL til 2020
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:11:23
No the babs like new lambo cars if not I don't get the arse ��
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:45:08

OMG welcome to crypto world 
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:03:32
Nice feature.
I have jaxx it doesn't have that features but I still love it 
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:12:07
I have been buying long time last at $4000 in October but I also bought some today. I think it is a good time to buy because, get real dudes you will never manage to buy at the rock lowest time. And yes it may go further down than today but so what? Just buy and Go with the flow and HODL ��
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:28:33
Same shit Mr perfect Say no more 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:59:12
Say no more just do it looser. Get rich or go home to mummy ��
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:17:59
Why what's the problem? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:53:59
No way it's been very stable today 
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:07:36
Why get so excited already. 
The launch isn't before Q2 2018 at the earliest and for iPhone iOS not before Q3 2018.
That's  if everything is going as planned which does not normally happen.
This is just a stupid teaser to raise the sale.
Yes I  got  one. Love it but hate to wait 6-8 month til I can connect it to my iPhone X
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:39:20
Did you receive that information in the kindergarten while counting your weekly pocket money?
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:30:25
Sorry I meant 12 words so you are alright 
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:59:30
There is no new big "investors" only private people using their tiny cash. The investors are still waiting and have not yet left the stock market. But when they get on the sky is the limit 
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:52:43
Of course they will get it back. They didn't do it on purpose it was a computer foul that can happen any exchange. They are all shit when something goes wrong so relax. Coinbase is just as good as other exchanges 
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:27:27
Send to Gdax
Owners are the same 
Best and easy way to do it 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:42:18
If you like to yeah why not it's up to you if you want. Isn't that what you prefer Since you asked.
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:05:09
Good luck 
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:09:06
So you know everything? Start reading then you maybe learn something 
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:41:52
That's true if you dear.
I don't dear though I love cash in my pocket 
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:35:49
It is the sender that decide the speed not both or the receiver.
I don't know how fast 
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:56:26
Smart doing just HODL it through the waves 
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:35:26
Significant is mathematical like zero in profits 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:41:35
I have a 12.5 Bitcoin I bought in 2015 do you think that this is the best time  to sell it now? �� I didn't sell in December because I thought  it would go higher and now I am afraid that it is all going to crash ��
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:41:49
Assets like bitcoin should not be used by chi so I don't think so 
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:09:33
I thought that this was a forum for discussion not a playroom for kindergarten. But I am probably wrong it seems like 
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:29:57
Google is your friend 
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:22:10
Nice 
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:05:25
You don't win bitcoin its a scam how can you believe in it?
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:52:20
Everyone and believe that they are dead right as usual 
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:18:35
Just go for it you will soon find out how rich you get �� BTW if you read statistics you see that 90% is pump &amp; guess what ��
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:37:17
I use jaxx for daily use and Ledger NanoS for bigger amounts as that is safer but not convenient for daily trading 
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:29:30
OMG I am really happy we didn't sign up for the European union.
That saved our country for a lot of problems.
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:56:09
Don't think so. Why should they?
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:39:06
So what about Chinese new year?
It's really moving fast forward now 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:23:07
Be cool just HODL and Go with the flow. Cash out 2020 and buy your lambo 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:36:13
I just love to HODL and dream of 2020 $95.000 and then I cash out my lambo dream. Let's dream on dudes to the end of the sky ����
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:09:40
It might happen if you dream hard enough 
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:54:59
The Chinese people just like the rest of the world spend money on big days like new year and Christmas. Did you spend money last Christmas? Look at the history, every single Chinese New Year the last 5 year the price has dropped, so will happen in a few days also. But probably not any significant due to the bloodbath we just have emerged from. It will probably just be like a normal day in the world of Bitcoin. ����
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:34:44
Up and down it goes like usual. And "everybody" knows that it will hit the bottom or sky any time 
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:39:55
How is that possible when the price last 24H has been $ 8029 - $ 8864 and when did you hit between that �� and you already sold? Or is it just "paper" money?
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:59:30
Read that some lost their cash.
Probably deserve it.
Many lambo dreamers got bit in the arse due to greed and borrowed fiat.
Just HODL or get out of the game.
 
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:41:23
Ok I'm sorry. Just go in to the trading business 
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:54:56
Please get real you don't know what you are doing and talking about. Pull out you will lose your hard savings in this game. Start reading a bit before you enter the crypto world or you may get burned ��
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:47:30
You are right l am not funny I am definitely serious. So how old are you may I ask?
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:38:16
WTF is happening. Not again this is never ending.I want my lambo. Please rise so I can go shopping. I give up l go and hang myself 
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:46:03
Amen ��
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:10:27
You are dead right - sell new the dip is coming 
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:45:36
This is the crypto life. Don't think its anything to do about it. Just ignore them they are just kidding 
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:52:45
Why bother to daytrade when it is safer and more to gain by hodl.
I just don't get it when bitcon is known to be volatile.
You will never manage to buy at peaks anyway 
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:00:38
Just another scam 
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:06:38
Sorry I didn't know I am fool 
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:23:46
Sure the world is full of fools.

I love being a Norwegian citizens and paying my taxes to get all the benefits we have compared to all other countries. 
Norway is the best country to live!

@_date: 2018-02-04 16:56:39
That's normal the market is following Bitcoin if it goes up all coins go up and down. Just chill out  Hodl and Go with the flow j

@_date: 2018-02-10 19:45:14
This is all just bulshit all the talk about bear and bull market. Because NOBODY understand ANYTHING about the blockchain crypto market simply because this is all new to everyone. Its just as Mr Buffet is said time over time : I don't understand anything about what the heck that crypto things is......so guys just get on or get lost Go with the flow and stop all this stupid trying of making a analysis, because there is nothing to analyze �� get real 
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:32:23
So how much are you gonna buy big boy?
.01000000 BTC?
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:13:22
Time that people learn but sadly they will not.
The "investors" are too greedy with their eyes closed and pockets open 
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:47:31
Yes sorry my English 
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:57:55
Because every Asian new year the price has gone down but so what you won't hit the ground floor anyway so just buy now 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:47:50
Why is the bitcoin so little volatile today. Is it quiet before the bloodbath is starting due to Chinese new year?
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:24:36
Just another classic scam.
Just go ahead and get your new cash balance to cry of.
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:20:26
No way. 
Too expensive 
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:18:09
Oh yeah what about the gas?
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:51:48
Why do you spam the forum with this shit 
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:00:18
Yeah I grow up pretty bad and I am dreaming of getting really rich by buying coins 
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:43:54
Don't think it is over yet. I'm sure it will still go further down before it stabilize and then slowly raise again to a new all high ��
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:41:43
Your hopes are your dreams 
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:29:50
The bear is back again its starting to go down. The dip is on. Yippee glad I sold 2 hours ago now I am buying back. Just love the game. Let's make the move and get the lambo or maybe I have to settle down with a pair of shoes?
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:34:31
Yes there is my mum told me that I would be really rich when I grow up 
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:25:20
This place is a kindergarten for kids just dreaming with no clue what they are talking about so just take it for what it is.
Say no more 
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:38:15
Like it has been doing every day this year ��
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:33:11
What also is great with jaxx is that you have ShapeShift so you can easily convert to some different coins 
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:31:31
You can mine to 2041.
Its not possible to mine it all before that time.
So what's the problem?
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:17:16
The "investors" won't learn they're blindfolded with their pockets wide and just waiting to get rich and buy the lambo 
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:33:48
That's the way to do it ��
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:25:09
Ups its happening its turned around going down again. Will it hit $5000?
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:07:20
No problem you have the seed (24words) so you can loose your coldwallet (recommend jazz.io) or what ever you just connect to the internet and you are back in business 
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:40:50
Welcome to the world of crypto where everyone is lying and everyone gets rich.
There is no losers in the crypto world 
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:48:46
Make a good guess.
How is it possible to know that.
Welcome to crypto world.
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:56:27
In teori yes but you won't hit the pikes when it is so volatile 
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:04:42
You can buy my domain. Its for sale fuckingbitcoin.com. How much can I get for it??
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:45:56
Thats when my HODL ends and I decided to cash out or keep on HODL for another two years 
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:23:50
Whow a lot of people who are experts on bitcoin with expert experience in this forum. Tell me how to get the knowledge of the blockchain technology? I'm lost 
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:39:29

The good old whales are pumping and all the morons are jumping on the horse because now they are gone get fng rich.

@_date: 2018-02-09 22:46:34
No difference but you go minus due mining fee 
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:54:08
Its not free you have to do your duty and pay taxes.
Remember that while counting the fiat 
@_date: 2018-04-02 10:18:03
That's what I call HODL...
Say no more...
