I don't think the widget is right man 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:10:05
Sure did. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:03:23
I should have been more clear, hedge funds dumped in drove it up , community investors that have been in took some profits
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:53:55
Not totally, its a definite possibility.
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:19:35
Im new to the remind me guys,  never got so many of them
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:52:26
I agree, I changed my position a little. since 3 am lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:54:46
Yeah I saw that , I think Merkle took it down
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:52:25
Its definitely parabolic at the moment
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:11:51
No kidding right 
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:46:58
Thats why I like forcast sites I like to see how accurate they are.  Its fun. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:33:33
Everyone is talking about the most recent forecast that are coming out.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:40:04
Likely will see parabolic growth until DEC 20th, slight dip, then resurgence
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:17:11
11k by Christmas would be awesome, but economically unlikely unless that's what everyone buys for Christmas, actually that's what my 7-year-old is now getting. Thanks for the gift idea!!
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:56:41
I think you will see some profit taking if it does to send it slightly lower temporarily. Either way it's exciting movement.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:29:05
Hey I said it wasnt impossible. im rooting for it just trying to be reserved too. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:08:29
Now you know 3 people lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:27:42
You must be a better trader then. I only funded an entire ICO on trading.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:01:03
Look at 3am -3:40 profits taken. Rebound than horizontal.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:07:18
Where 's yours?
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:14:35
You can find it here   But be aware this is exactly that, a forecast.It can be wrong in many ways.I would not make any investment decisions solely on a graph like this. It highlights a best-case scenario in my opinion and doesn't take into account real-world variances and situations that could immediately change the forecast. Do your research check many forecasts. look at the real movement of the market, read the news, check political announcements, tech journals and speak with as many people as you can before making any buys off a forecast chart like this. They can be exciting to see them predict this type of parabolic movement. Be educated and don't take risks you can afford. Have fun!

I use 5 different charts, I try to show the simplest form for people with general experience. Like I said 3 am - 3:40. there was a small sell-off that's why I'm awake. Just keeping an eye on it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:10:50
No not all  , seen quite a few dips , just dont think its will happen again past 7 , just an opinion. If it does ill buy more. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:27:07
pretty cool though
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:27:32
Thanks Mowron
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:52:49

@_date: 2017-11-27 11:20:49
All I was saying
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:38:33
I don't have that on CoinBase or Gdax, so weird. I have the high of 8968. I'll  post screenshot
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:41:20
Thats pretty cool I havent used that remind me before. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:14:51
I use a few just thought their charts were interesting today, thank you though good tip.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:07:14
I see it hitting the resistance point of 10K taking a small dip, and rebounding towards 12K by the end of January.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:47:59
I posted the 1 minute on my page, I'm still not seeing over 9. I WANT TO SEE IT 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:01:55
NO no hedge funds taking profit
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:37:14
Were cool lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:51:14
I think the days of buying BTC in the sub 7k range are long gone.
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:40:38
This is the greatest. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:29:35
I dont claim to be an expert man. I have fun with it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:47:42
I think Bittrex's Chart is a little bit of a stretch, stating its going to hit 9k by 11pm tonight, but we will see. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:46:07
There was just a small sell off on Gdax that took it down a little , I kind of thought that might happen , but shoot I want to see it hit 9k I just bought more. lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:16:12
Average daily swing is 1-3%  5 % isn't impossible but that was the point of the post, that's what they are forecasting.
