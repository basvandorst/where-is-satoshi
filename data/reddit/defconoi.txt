Upvoted, only buy Bitcoin, don't use it to purchase anything with the fee until they fix the fees.

I believe we are headed towards a long down trend.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:32:35
that is why I chose a low enough stop loss, I believe if it drops to 7k, it could drop considerably more, I'll be alerted and then open my trading platform to re-enter lower.

Different buyers and sellers on each exchange, they can push the price higher or lower depending on the demand and will of the seller and buyer market.  Each exchange will eventually even up in price when people do arbitrage and buy cheaper coins at one exchange and sell them higher at another.

no, it gets sent to shift financial directly and instantly
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:48:27
Its not dropping, just more people happen to be selling today.  Once more people get around the learning curve of buying bitcoin the price may go up again.  Expect 3-5k drops in the coming days, if you can't stomach it, sell and buy stocks
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:19:39

Just having some Bitcoin and the ability to spend it while being here from the beginning is priceless, everyone that knows me knows I've been in this game forever.   I'm not rich, I bought and sold Bitcoin throughout the years and even lived off of mining it, one of the best experiences of my life.

it is because if you need to sell some bitcoin, sending to BTC-E will not be timely, also people need to know so they wont panic even more
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:40:41
I've held Bitcoin since 2011, I have never seen such a bad wave of news, I suspect the price will drop even more.  The Tiger Direct &amp; Overstock news was not enough to encourage adoption and a price rise, instead we have seen a steady and slightly increasing downtrend.  This downtrend should continue until possibly after the Seized Silk road coins get auctioned off and all the bad news passes and we see some great innovation in the Bitcoin realm.  I would suggest being very cautious buying into Bitcoin right now, every time I have initiated a buy order I have lost USD even after increasing BTC holdings with a corresponding buy order.  I tried to trade out of this, im considering holding USD until this price stabilizes to a new low and user adoption may increase.  I would not tell grandmom to buy bitcoins to invest during this downtrend...
@_date: 2014-02-09 08:10:08
Great time to buy IMHO 
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:28:06
I just bought more, keep panicing ppl , Bitcoin does this then makes you cry after u sell, I've learned the hard way to not sell, and buy on dips.
@_date: 2014-04-01 22:18:08
This is an awesome idea that I've had too, imagine loading your Coinbase account by buying a gift card or prepaid card at CVS or Walmart or convenience stores that carry gift cards.  They already have steam cards, PayPal reload cards and other cards of this nature, doing this would allow Bitcoin accessibility to everyone.
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:37:44
accept that regulators wont let it happen without getting their hands wet to get a cut, maybe it can be pushed where casino's could apply for a license to be able to do so.  In the perfect world though, casino's should have the freedom to accept any payment they want without interference.

@_date: 2014-01-05 18:55:29
Possibly because allot of miners dropped off the network because of the increasing hash rate, also maybe they were Chinese based nodes?  We'd need more info on the location of the dropped nodes to be sure.
@_date: 2014-01-28 02:30:07
Coinbase is great, the verification process sucks though and waiting a week for bitcoins is insane.  I'd like to see getting Bitcoin at every convenience store and western union location or Walmart become a possibility.  I think discounts for using Bitcoin would help move adoption forward.  Tiger direct and overstock offer no discounts and no incentive for people to change.

I propose an idea for Blockchain.info to be able to link bitcoin addresses to email addresses or phone numbers like a Domain name system. All people should have to do is type in someone's email or phone number, even address and have the Bitcoin's sent to the registered bitcoin address. Of course this would need security implemented and verification so that nobody but the owner could change this information, I propose being able to do this by signing a message and adding that message to the blockchain for verification, its simple yet elegant. I already know with Blockchain you can send bitcoins via email, text, facebook, but adding this feature would greatly improve security by now allowing someone who can intercept those messages to steal your Bitcoin, let me know what you think. This is one of many ideas I have and hope to see implemented in the future

a few weeks ago when the price was averaging in the 800's we saw some stability but during that time we were slightly in a downtrend that sped up and spiraled into what it is today.  I think the price needs to drop a bit more and we may need to see a stable price of maybe 550 for a month with a gradual increase for the price to continue to rise.  With this we will need some major backers of bitcoin, like paypal, the post office, maybe a few governments accepting it or changing their stance.  As it stands this downtrend will continue, Tiger Direct and overstock was not enough good news it seems

The 21 Million BTC limit
One somewhat controversial property of Bitcoin is its fixed currency supply. There are currently 25 BTC being generated every 10 minutes, and this amount cuts in half every four years. All in all, there will never be more than 21 million BTC in existence. On the other hand, each bitcoin can be split into 100 million pieces (called “satoshis”), so it will not become difficult to use Bitcoin if its value goes up the same way it would become problematic to trade with dollars if each penny was enough to buy a car. Thus, all in all, the total number of currency units that will ever exist stands at 2,100,000,000,000,000: 2.1 quadrillion, or about 250.899. In choosing this figure, Satoshi was much luckier, or wiser, than most people realize. First of all, the number is considerably less than 264 – 1, the largest integer that can be stored in a standard integer on a computer – go above that, and the integers wrap around to zero like an odometer.
Second, however, there is another, lower threshold that the total satoshi count manages to fall just below: the largest possible integer that can be exactly represented in floating point format. Integers are not the only kind of number that computers can store; to handle decimal numbers, computers use a format known as floating point representation. Floating point representation is essentially a binary version of scientific notation. For example, here are some values that you may be familiar with if you studied any physics:
Mass of the Earth: 5.972 * 1024 kg
Mass of the Sun: 1.989 * 1030 kg
Speed of light: 2.998 * 108 m/s
One lightyear: 9.460 * 1015 m
Mass of a proton: 1.672 * 10-27 kg
Planck length: 1.616 * 10-35 m
Notice how scientific notation allows you to express all of these values with reasonable accuracy despite their wildly varying scales. Floating point notation is essentially scientific notation in binary; when you store the number 9.625, your computer stores “1.001101 * 1011” (or rather, it stores 01000000 00100011 01000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000, which is the same thing in high-precision serialized form). In this high-precision form, the “significand” (the part that’s not the exponent) has 52 bits. What this means is that high-precision (more precisely, “double precision”) floating point numbers are good enough to exactly store integers up to 253, but not higher – if you go higher, you start lopping off digits at the end. Bitcoin’s 250.9 satoshis are, in exponential terms, just below this maximum.
Why do we care about floating point values if we have integers? Because many higher-level programming languages (eg. Javascript) do not expose the low-level “floating point” and “integer representations”, instead providing the programmer with only the concept of “number” – represented in floating point form, of course. If Satoshi had chosen 210 million instead of 21 million, Bitcoin programming in many languages would be considerably harder than it is today.
Note that Stefan Thomas in his BitcoinJS library did not take advantage of this, so that library uses a specialized “big number” object instead of a plain number to store transaction output values. When asked about this, Thomas replied that he realized that using regular numbers was possible, but BitcoinJS needed to include the “big number” library regardless, since elliptic curve arithmetic requires numbers up to 2512, so the choice was arbitrary. My own BitcoinJS fork (which also adds other improvements) does use plain numbers to store the number of satoshis, a decision motivated largely by the desire to be compatible with external sources of transaction output data such as sx and pybitcointools.

Funny how 30 minutes after she paid with coinbase my payment went through.  I guess its hit and miss with coinbase, and that's unacceptable for payments that are needed fast

When bitcoin is as stable as the dollar then it can be used as savings.  People are not going to store their money on something that continually devalues and is volatile.  Until the day comes when mass hackings and mass adoption happens to the point where bitcoin isn't so volatile then it can be a contender against the fucked up central banking system.   Logically bitcoin is having a hard time right now, there has been lots of good news but those few big hacks are more news worthy and more people see the bad news, bad news isn't good news when it comes to $.

All I've seen is a sustained down trend and absolutely no upward indications, all downward momentum is related to unbearable bad news.  Until this trend changes and levels out for maybe 3 months we could possibly see a reversal.  Allot of my friends that are early adopters are almost all bailing.  Be careful out there guys, if u see it go up a bit, its not a buy signal.  I recommend selling if u have a big investment, if u have a small one, ride it if u dare.

Blocks by definition increase the size of the Blockchain.  All the 8mb size is is a limit that would be used anyways.

It's easiest, and if you think about it all your personal info is already accessible for a price anyways.  Odds are they have it or could get it.  lol
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:17:53
Big blocks dont increase the size of the blockchain at all, the size is adaptive up to 8mb.  So if there is few transactions it could be 2mb or less.  It just allows more transactions to process in less time/blocks.

I think any way you analyze it though, bitcoin should gain in value, the recent news reports may push big players in the Bitcoin realm and should even further bitcoin's value and legitimacy.  I bought over 40 bitcoins at $20 and held them, reinvested them through the years.  Since being an early adopter and watching charts over the years I see there is no real basis for the price to crash.  Common sense and the facts lead me to believe todays market price is a bargain compared to what it may be imminently.

I believe I found one of Satoshi's active wallets:
Satoshi is a defender of generating a new bitcoin address for every transaction, I am sure all these are satoshi's, a few of the 2009 blocks have recent transactions like:

Most recent transaction:

I think what we could do is create bitcoin donation addresses for all nonprofits.  Accept donations for them and then when they choose to accept them we can verify that the coins directly to them.  I propose that we do not take any percentage for this service out of individual transactions to nonprofits, but allow people to donate to the people who run the service if they choose.  I've been thinking of doing this myself but don't have as much time or web design skills as I like.  It would take a team of reputable members to process verification of nonprofits for them to receive their funds or, we could automate the process and donate it to them to USD.  Id like to see coin base or mtgox or a exchange do this at no cost.  What do you think?
@_date: 2013-02-24 00:10:15

well considering that there was a huge DDOS on MtGox, all these micro transactions could have been from normal accounts and looked like a flood because Mt Gox's API was unresponsive, you can't deny though that the lag caused by the DDOS caused a massive panic, people need to get it out of their head it was Mt Gox's API at issue.  It was a combination of DDOS, viral panicing and thousands of people logging into to mt Gox initiating trading with people F5F5F5F5ing repetitively, not to mention a epicly large influx of transaction's to people's wallets from the blockchain could have added to that lag as well, because it could have ate up a lil bandwidth and CPU time.  Lots of factors here, not just an API issue.

Also, a note to the newbies: Dont sell if you see a large sell order when Mt Gox is lagged, just wait it out, and hold.  100% of the time in the past the price bounces right back, if you sell or buy or do anything you'll probably end up losing with the lag

they are combining high frequency trading with DDOS, and causing a panic, causing people to log in and buy/sell rapidly, causing even more lag and panic.  I think mtgox should limit the amount of high frequency trading maybe after 20 fast trades, but even then someone could open up multiple accounts to spam the market

@_date: 2013-03-07 21:19:55
until we reach 1 Billion market cap, consider yourself an early adopter, we are currently just getting world wide acceptance and most people are just hearing about bitcoin now, there is allot more awareness of it now than ever, its a good time, get in now while its too late and the price goes up, I dont forsee bitcoin going below 34, I think thats around the bottom right now and we should see steady growth above 40, investing a small amount and holding for the ride seems like a good idea, get your feet wet first, when u feel comfortable in the price buy more.  Try and buy low and hold, dont make trades based on emotion or others just freaking out, allot of the people whom say buy buy buy, sell sell sell and the sort are relatively new adopters and arent used to the swing in price, if you get in, expect large price swings, dips and highs, initially until we get a higher market cap these swings and dips from a few 1000 in btc transactions will be less because it wont effect the market as much, this happened last night, and people got freaked out, mostly people who just got in and they decided to sell and a few people who hoarded old coins cashed out which lowered the price to allow newer people to buy in at a cheap price, a few more sell offs happened and people got too excited, mt gox got overloaded and eventially caught up then the price stabilized.  Buy in low, and right now the price still can be considered low, especially since we got so much attention right now

i have to agree, this is not good news at all, what they will end up doing is regulating/taxing bitcoin-&gt;USD conversion at exchange sites.  I sure hope some bitcoin exchanges go underground and on Tor and mail cash, bank deposits are a pretty bad idea, especially if they can monitor the transactions and regulate them and eventually tax them.

Totally wrong, I did some extensive research over the years and have pinned him down to two different people by doing writing analysis.  One thing I can tell you is he has multiple identities that he uses online, he was very upset about wikileaks using bitcoin and that he still communicates to this day on irc and bitcointalk.  To be honest I'm afraid of knowing who he is, he is nothing what you think he is, he is very private and we should respect that.  It is dangerous for him to be known, for him to be found is easy, chat logs, host names, nick names.  I'm honestly surprised why he hasn't been found yet.  All the news articals about finding who he is are all way off.  Maybe there is something about his past that would make him look bad being the creator of bitcoin?  Its better to leave him faceless until he reveals himself when it is safe to do so.  His life is in our hands, do not reveal his identity!

@_date: 2013-11-27 06:49:07
They sure have the tools at their disposal to find him even if they haven't already, they could compel any service he used to provide personal identifying information such as IP addresses or use PRISM bypassing all of that.  I'm sure they have data to identify him with certainty
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:01:17
^ I agree, while I'm glade Satoshi started it all, he ultimately ended up giving up Bitcoin because of Wikileaks and other issues... and passed the Torch on to many other developers that transformed and improved Bitcoin, today its allot different than what it was.  I hope someday though the Bitcoins he mined are put to good use, maybe for charity and to help better mankind. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 13:10:14
Yes very, they are reputable and even have their address listed
@_date: 2013-03-06 05:54:16
Buy some bitcoin because mining with current hardware is not profitable.  Buying bitcoin is profitable as the cost of bitcoin rises.

what you should do is go through all these early blocks and parse which ones had recent transactions, they could be satoshi
@_date: 2013-12-15 04:55:20
the more this gets pushed down slowely, I have a feeling the price is going to moon shot up

Your computer probably had a key logger installed or you had a weak password that was known or guessable.  Your funds are only as secure as you are.
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:53:26
Oh shit lol
@_date: 2013-05-21 17:36:54
also, they havnt even sold 5000 full shares yet to secure a board seat(havelock), so no, it has a ways to go yet
@_date: 2013-05-14 15:30:41
Use Havelock its easier, sign up and deposit 1btc to your deposit address than order units and hold them, every wed you'll get dividends and hopefully increases in share price
@_date: 2013-04-26 03:16:10
2 factor auth disables them from downloading your wallet enable it now

only do this if you disclose this information and get the customers signature, im quite sure you'll end up in jail quick as shit, I do pc repair myself and would never do such a thing
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:25:30
there is definately high frequency trading, but the thing is, whoever is spamming .01 amount trades is also ddosing their servers so its a combination of the two, including people trying to react to the fast trades, its a bad combination, so its best not to add to the lag and attack and just wait it out
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:36:56
We are stars!
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:07:33
edit: transfer them to bitfloor, then do a free ach withdrawal 
@_date: 2013-12-29 17:16:46
I'll test this today for you ☺
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:30:01
There are plenty of ways to fix this, make the second password mandatory to decrypt the wallet.  There are plenty of other creative ways to secure the wallet,even a pattern lock that isn't susceptible to keylogging.  Passwords in plaintext or arguing for it is idiotic and an advertisement for Android malware creators to steal your money.

I know why it was cancelled, they probably didnt have enough bitcoin at the price we bought it at, and it was dirt cheap, instead of wasting 7 business days in bank transfers they could have cancelled the order as soon as I placed it

I will be buying some stuff this weekend, I hope more people do as well, would be nice if we can at least do 75% of the target or more.  Bitcoin needs bitcoinstore, right now its the best bitcoin got.  There are others but they have nowhere near the selection that this site has.  Let's buy a few things at least to keep them busy.
@_date: 2013-03-12 05:14:20
I'd have to agree as well, my post wasnt thought through enough, maybe instead of that, maybe just a link to the bitcoin.org page for more detailed info.

Actually it won't when there is a much larger market cap where a few thousand doesn't effect the price as much
@_date: 2013-03-11 16:18:16
eh, well I could see the market taking a hit when we see headlines of "Largest Bitcoin Store shut down because _____" but anyways, he took a large gamble in making an agreement with them that is so large.  He maybe needs to up his advertisement a bit and give better shipping rates.  But I do plan on buying some products off bitcoinstore to support him.  Unfortunately the bitcoin gets converted right to USD and doesnt really help the market as a whole though...

just do it with some extra money laying around that you call play money, I did it and made thousands from hundreds, but thats my experience, who knows what the future may bring, but its looking good so far
@_date: 2013-02-17 05:45:17
I doubt we'd go to 100 in a month but right now currently I believe bitcoin is less volatile and more stable since it is gathering more widespread adoption and acceptance.  I have a good sum of money in bit coin that I recently deposited.  I see nothing in the news or any reason bit coin would lose value.  I feel safer with bitcoin than my money in the bank currently.
@_date: 2013-05-22 03:22:55
if I were you, i'd save up, buy a few passthough shares in asicminer and maybe some asic chips in a group buy and get a diy asic

apparently its easier to open a chinese bank account than I thought: 
Hong Kong has less restrictions than Mainland china:
Opening a bank account in Hong Kong is very straightforward, much more so than in the US, UK or Europe. To open a bank account in Hong Kong all you require is ID and proof of address. It is not necessary to be resident in Hong Kong or have a work visa in Hong Kong and it’s perfectly possible for a tourist to open a bank account in the city.
For those with an address in Hong Kong you need to provide proof of address, such as a utility bill or official government communication. Non residents need to also provide one of these documents from their home country address. The bank will then post a letter to that address which you must furnish at the bank to open the account. Accepted forms of ID are passport or Hong Kong Identity Card.
HSBC, Hang Seng and Standard Chartered are all popular with expats in Hong Kong. Be aware that not all bank employees are fully up to speed on their own bank regulations and may not know exactly what documents you’re required to provide. Expats don’t often open bank accounts in Fanling. It’s best to head to the larger branches in Central where you will find English speaking staff and managers more used to the specific needs of expats.
There are also branches of most major, international banks in the city, although not all offer private banking services, those that do include Bank of America, Citibank and Deutsche Bank.

I think it's time for us to create a foundation that we can directly donate bitcoin to any non-profit organization and that it is converted free to USD to them, but make it aware to each organization/non-profit that the funds came from bitcoin and have a short bit explaining why they should officially take bitcoin donations from their website

On top of that satoshi mined thousands of coins that have never been spent, and who knows how many lost wallets their are, also there is only a little over 12 million in existence so far.
Edit satoshi has 1814400 BTC , and 1148800 BTC has never been spent (63%).   So its quite possible those 1.1 million coins satiahi has will never be spent or are lost forever.

I also think the sky is the limit at this point and we need to do our part in spreading bitcoin as well
@_date: 2013-05-14 13:55:57
The best place to buy right now is Coinbase or dwolla +campbx The best exchange?  Campbx, mtgox, and its probably a good idea to spread funds evenly across more exchanges for arbitrage opportunities.

Also havelockinvestments.com is cheap as well, possibly cheaper at .0161 btc a share.  I wish there was more press about this a month ago, this seems smarter than keeping btc in my wallet right now, their future seems good as well considering they have 200+ terrahashes ready to deploy.

in that thread there is pictures of 130+ boxes of chips that was posted a month ago, they have answered support questions regarding their assembled miners but have not answered any question regarding the chips, they will not confirm/deny shipment and will not confirm/deny they have the chips, plan on shipping the chips or possible other issues.  The fact that they have not logged in to Bitcointalk and answered emails, phone calls and pretty much dropped off the grid is suspect and suspicious.  With Millions of dollars at play you'd think they would have the common courtesy to at least confirm that they will be shipping the chips "someday".  At least BFL lets customers know nothing has shipped and tells their customers to stfu.  Something is obviously very wrong.

I believe coinbase, bitpay, zipbit all automatically convert the usd to btc price for you and when someone pays, you'll get the usd amount, you wont really have to change any pricing since its all done for you through these merchants plugins I believe.  No idea why there is a price hike since merchant fees are cheaper than paypal and other merchants, I think they are just trying to get as much profit as they can.  Right now Mega.co.nz is making big news for being very secure private and now accepting bitcoin, I highly suggest allowing people to create their own key for backups and possibly a android/ios app that allows mobile bitcoin/cc payment or in-app billing through android.  I say, try it out, im sure lots of us on here will throw some btc your way just for trying something new, as long as you provide a great service and experience.  Most of us on here arent really paranoid, allot of us are investors.

oh to answer your question on who else can read it, any root app or app that exploits your device to gain root, also there are probably ways for a non-root app to access this file indirectly that we have not discovered yet, so be careful and take my advice

The best way to send bitcoin through eBay is through certified registered priority mail with signature confirmation, I recently did this and the guy never picked up the goods because a signature is required. After a week or two sitting at the post office it will be shipped back, if its not accepted its considered abandoned and its eligible for seller protection and your funds won't be reversed.

I see it continuing to fall right now, but if you bought in higher than me, id try my damnedest to hold on.  I dont see it dropping much more, so selling and scooping up more coins could be a bad move, best to stay in and ride it out, if it gets super cheap buy with whatever u got

I think we could still use bitcoin even on Mars, even with a delay what we could do is split the blockchain and every day at a certain time or interval all the transactions could be uploaded to earth as well as downloaded and verified.  I believe people would have a mars address and a earth address and if you send money to the mars address it will take time to get there.  Basically it would kinda have to be forked or mod'd for this but I think it would be solved by then in some way

I doubt it will go lower, people are starting to realize they made a mistake selling because of some stupid script kid wannabee hacker froze mt gox, and bitfloor by flooding it with packets when they should have kept buying.  We would be in the 300's today.  Can't believe anyone sold over lag.

What ID be interested in is creative ways to defend against this, I think if we all mined from all our devices at the same time we could pose a good defense.  Either that or a certain way to blacklist the attacker, but that power could be used against legit miners...  Any ideas?
@_date: 2013-05-21 17:48:46
here is a smart thing to do:
There is arbitrage opportunities between havelock, btct.co, and bitfunder.  When one is high, sell high, transfer btc to other lower exchange, buy low, and repeat.
Also sometimes you can double dip dividends, when one exchange gets dividends transfer to another that hasnt got them yet and you'll get dividends x2.  Right now its too early to sell, but if you do, try the arbitrage opportunities to keep the btc in the shares and acquire more shares for more profits

I think its motivated more by interest.  Logically I think investing in bitcoin may be smarter than investing in other things.  Bitcoin has value and its purposes and uses are great.  As more people look into it we will see the price soar, after all its deflationary and meant to increase in value against deflation.

this is the wrong additude, this is causing bitcoin to be more volatile and is causing widespread panic, and keeping away larger investors, it isnt good for the future of bitcoin.  Ultimately you buy bitcoins cheap but the attacks continue and the coins dont increase in value because on ongoing attacks, this needs to be resolved or bitcoin will cease to increase in value and decline and result in a bad investment

every weekend we see a drop, usually fridays, then mon-tue people's friday paychecks/deposits clear and are available at mtgox mon-tue.  This dip is no different than any other week, it was however a good opportunity to sell at lets say 79 and buy back in now.  Right now I'd be buying back in if I had cashed out because then you'd have more coins.  Its a good time to buy because right now its low.
@_date: 2013-03-02 17:50:11
i've bought all my coins from btcquick.com they charge about 7 percent and the more coins you buy the fee lowers.  Sometimes I get my coins within an hr there, or sometimes a day or two depending on when I order, but when I email support they tend to be very helpful and expedite my order if asked, but I am considering ziggap for larger bitcoin purchases

yea, dwave is supposedly going to start selling quantum computers to corporations, im thinking NASA and the NSA are probably ahead of them in technology, probably lockheed martin.  What we should do is start talking about more secure signature/encryption than we currently have then send our coins to the new address for better protection against future attacks.  the nsa gotta be putting big money into quantum right now because of terrorist's using encryption to hide their communication, there is valuable intel every day lost because they can't crack it.  And quantum computers are the only hope they have.  As the bitcoin market cap increases so does the risk for attacks because there is an even bigger reward.  There are many hackers that hack for money to find bugs, hack bitcoin and you could eventually be very rich

they need to remove that from the market
@_date: 2013-03-04 16:53:30
in theory you could allow the card to be loaded with a moneypak to buy bitcoins easier, and the credit card backend could function as a full fledged bitcoin wallet like blockchain.info

add an SSL cert, and i'll use this, also can you provide any details on the security you use?  Is it zero knowledge ie: you cannot hack accounts?
@_date: 2013-02-23 01:44:15
Yes it should become official with its official bitcoin currency, and internet freedom based laws.  I think there needs to be a internet bill of rights, and one of those rights is being able to pay for things anonymously and without big corporate companies charging outrageous fees.

I think the ideal price per asicminer share is 5btc, I think between 2-3btc is a stable price, this company isnt that well known yet and their dividends are stable, steady and increasing with the hardware sales and should also increase in a week or two with them solo mining, so honestly it seems to me that its heavily undervalued right now, especially since they hash at 30% of the network and have 200+TH ready to deploy to maintain their hash percentage when avalon and bfl finish shipping
@_date: 2013-03-05 22:03:34
As long as new services add btc with the market hype and it continues we should see some stability.  Let's push vendors to discount bitcoin purchases, no tax, no 4% transaction charge.  So in theory they can lower prices almost 10%
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:50:08
something really fucked up happened to me, I saw the drop, transferred a few coins to bitfloor, it never confirmed, the transaction cancelled and never hit the block chain, I would have sold at 240, bought back in at 60, but blockchain.info fucked up my transaction somehow, and I even payed with a fee, today it doesnt even look like the transaction took place.  Guess i'll be using bitcoin-qt
@_date: 2013-02-18 21:37:49
could many ultra high giga hash users kill bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:51:05
honestly, its a little late for the price to drop significantly, even if it does(which it just dropped 7 dollars as I type this) there is going to be a very large cash infusion the next 3 days because banks open and the exchanges will get allot of fiat deposit's, the price should stabilize today probably above 140 and almost reach 200 if not surpass it by wednesday.  Thats my prediction, based on what usually happens, but I dont know nothing, im a computer tech who has been watching bitcoin 24/7 for the past 3 months
edit: also to note, its not really a drop for today unless it drops below 144, which it was yesterday, so as long as we are above that, in my eyes were still in the positive, so dont panic lol
@_date: 2013-02-21 06:55:18
I too trust bitcoin, and it seems allot of people are as well, bitcoin is far more predictable than fiat currencies
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:03:21
Secure your coins now, there might not be a drop this weekend
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:09:43

if people are letting lag cause a panic, they are freaking crazy, some script kiddies with thousands of virus infected pc's are packeting the exchanges to overload them and cause a panic, why do what they want?  Why not just keep the price stable, screw that script kiddies, they dont know how to hack, they just know how to DDOS because they are unable to do anything else
@_date: 2013-04-25 01:06:49
Nice site, I was looking forward to an android app with better charts

the exchanges are definitely getting attacked, money isnt at risk, ddos just floors the server and it cant process requests, or uses all their bandwidth, kinda like your gf watching netflix while you pwn ppl at quakelive
@_date: 2013-05-21 16:16:47
if you want to pay a premium and want bitcoin quick for convenience btcquick.com is very good, coinbase is great too, with low fee's but you gotta wait 3-4 business days

Why is this on the verge?
@_date: 2013-05-15 04:50:31
dont cash out, wait to see if it drops and buy in, it will likely rise again

Maybe he is .04 short for a purchase
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:17:02
I dont really care if you think im dumb or not, i've held bitcoin a long time, and I have not incurred any losses on my base investment, I got more at the bottom, and I plan on getting much more because, its beyond my gut feeling bitcoin is highly undervalued right now
edit: oh and my all in, is what I can afford to lose right now, for potential future profits
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:01:18
not necessarily, lets say I can buy 1 btc now at coinbase's current price of 615.40 if your verified for instant btc, send that to btc china and sell for almost 300 in profit, personally if I had a few grand or any money at all this is what I'd be doing, BFL screwed me and I put all my BTC in miners that are taking 6+ months to ship, I'd sell right now on btc china and buy back with a credit card even with a 7% fee from btcquick or coinbase
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:07:52
Don't game the market right now, we don't know for sure if there will be sell offs or buy ins.  Allot of people are waiting to buy in and we got some good momentum on the charts.  I don't see it falling any time soon.  If you sell you'll probably lose potential money especially if your planning on buying right back in.  Hold for now.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:23:00
because its now higher than it was :) just watch charts live 24/7 you'll be able to make good guesses I guess 
@_date: 2013-02-26 05:31:29

@_date: 2013-03-07 00:19:32
Not a crash just a few big sells
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:56:18
I agree, I think restaurants are screwing their employee's by passing on what they should be paid on to the customers.  In iceland and a bunch of other european countries they pay their wait staff a good hourly/monthly wage and they dont like to accept tips because in some countries its rude.  Its ridiculous that people have to tip at all if you think about it.
I tip in USD but in general I think tipping should be done away with and waiters should be payed based on how busy the restaurant is, or a percentage of sales that day if anything
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:16:48
I think someone is intentially trying to bring the price down due to all the small sells
@_date: 2013-03-05 20:17:28
Were getting big news msm reporting right now, allot of people will be buying and price will rise, buy and hold even if it dips a few bucks, its likely it will go above 45 soonish

its not crashing lol, we were at 144 yesterday, were still in the positive and should stabilize before there is a large cash infusion for the next 3-4 days, its a little too late for the price to crash, so dont freak out lol
@_date: 2013-03-04 17:03:14

@_date: 2013-03-03 01:13:12
I too am suspicious of this, im not too sure if this is a good idea or not, in theory, the US  government  could confiscate these coins locked up and wreak havok on the bitcoin community.  This seems hella shady and a very very bad idea.  I'll probably be switching exchanges, imagine if the US govt took over an exchange and took all our coins...  I feel as if bitcoin is gonna tank over this, and this sounds like good news initially, but bad news overall, I say keep bitcoin exchanges and infrastructure overseas or on the tor network,  I see dangerous times ahead...

Sure go ahead fill out the form and sue for damages in late shipment and violating the law in not giving you an option for refund.  Small claims cases are cheap and easy, go to your local magistrate, fill out the complaint form and damage assessment, and pay a small fee or file in forma pauperis if you cannot afford to file.  I advise everyone who has been mislead and scammed by the company to fill out my form and then lodge your own small claims case.  I'll also be investigating a class action suit if enough people fill this form out, so let people know.

I am an ex blackhat hacker, I dont really hack anymore, but there is allot of benefits to the High frequency trading combined with a DDOS for the hacker himself, first of all, he enjoys seeing you guys panic because of his actions and feels powerful, and continues to do it and also profit from it, and when you guys panic and log into mt gox it causes even more lag, congrats your making the script kiddies win and get cheap coins

Also imagine the effect of charging small business 4% and then a state tax of 6%.  Right there is 10% of their potential profits.  It doesn't make sense to me anyone uses PayPal and have expensive merchant accounts in stores.  I know some small business owners who own shops, they pay 4% on top of taxes.  Bitcoin absolutely needs to gain more awareness.  The benefits of it will save jobs and save lives, not just save money.

hoping we fall is extremely negative, honestly, if it falls or keeps falling people will seriously and positively not take bitcoin seriously, we need to hoard and hold on to our coins, spend them within the bitcoin economy, it is not smart to sell out so early since this is technically still in early adoption phase.  If we let it fall again, it only proves that the people who criticize bitcoin for high volitility and instability are right.

Its a ripoff, it would be cheaper to buy hardware, 20gh/s will not make you any money with the terrahash miners that are coming dec-feb.  It would probably be smarter to invest in the currency at this point.  Anything more than $10 a gig a hash is too expensive, blackarrow and cointerra are selling GH/s for less than $2 a gigahash.  Also if your smart stay away from cex.io as well

he's just bullshitting in hopes people sell so he can buy in cheap.  Anyways it would be cool if people did announce big cash outs before hand so people would understand the price drop and wouldnt induce a selloff.  It would actually make the price rise back to normal because people would understand the price drop and buy in cheaper
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:26:29
invest anything you can, buy in low, and sell high, but dont sell if its probable that the price will go higher then you'll be stuck at a loss trying to buy back in.  Right now is a good time to buy, mon-wed it will be too late and you'll be buying in at a premium price

The government doesn't need to ban bitcoins to stop crime, I'm sure the NSA and FBI have a list of people who are being watched closely, cispa and the new six strikes policy give the government allot of access and these criminals are bound to slip up.  They find a package with drugs or illegal contents in the mail service and then surveil the building.  Simple as that.  Even if they used a VPN they are still human and can be tracked and found.  A payment system isn't going to really change much, now if they banned vpns and Tor then we can really worry.  But yea bitcoin isn't the problem its the people.  And in due time they will get caught.  Bitcoin and all the security in the world won't help.

no, we need a better solution see: 
  
my solution would be that they need 100+ servers on different Gigabit links that route Mt Gox's price information and allow trading to be uneffected.  The Api needs to be revamped and abusers should have their IP blocked, Mt Gox also needs to be accessible on many different IP's even if their main site gets hit.  I say talk to the guys at thepiratebay, nobody can shut them down

From page: 
The Libertarian Party of Canada, a registered federal political party, is now accepting donations in Bitcoin (BTC).
WireService.ca Press Release - March 22, 2013 - The Libertarian Party is now accepting donations in Bitcoin (BTC) (1). The most significant advantages of Bitcoin are that the amount of Bitcoin is finite (2), and the software is open source (meaning anyone can read and understand exactly how the software works). Consequently, the amount of Bitcoin cannot be expanded -all current day government currencies are expanding their currency. Expanding currency, also called 'quantitative easing' or 'inflation' is the worst way that government makes money - the other two are through taxes and borrowing. Inflation hurts lower income families the most. The Bank of Canada is continually expanding the supply of Canadian dollars and the Canadian dollar is continually losing value. As the dollar is devalued, the price of goods and services tend to go up, resulting in an insidious tax on the productive working citizen.
The Libertarian Party supports the freedom of any individual or group to own gold or any other commodity of exchange, as well as the right to produce coinage and issue currency (3). Bitcoin is an option that Canadians should be free to use in financial exchanges, free from all governmental regulatory meddling.
The Libertarian Party must follow Elections Canada rules in order to maintain party status. For this reason, we currently only except donations under $20 CAD. Please learn more at libertarian.ca/bitcoin-donations

@_date: 2013-04-07 17:05:34
yup, someone is trying again to lower the price by rapid small trades at every penny, also to note, there is nothing to worry about regarding a crash or need to panic, for us to crash even to yesterdays price, there would have to be 9349 BTC Sold, which is around 1.5 million dollars, so just since 10pm last night we've had over 1.5 million dollars of bitcoin bought, so the price shouldnt crash below 145
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:27:31
that would have been a great opportunity for day traders that sold at 75 but I doubt we'll see much dips in the future after we get past these walls

You could sell bit coins privately, cash out via ordering cash on bitmit, ACH deposit to a prepaid CC without your name on it, western union, buy a money pak.  Lots of ways to avoid taxes, but its illegal and do it at your own risk

@_date: 2013-04-13 18:37:10
yes of course they could limit HFT, but then people will be complaining, Mt Gox still profits off of HFT as well, they are working on their api to optimize it, but it just isnt HFT that is causing the extreme lag, its a combination of factors, there is many ways they can mitigate the issues, it will take time, but eventually they will be almost invulnerable to attack.  The good thing about all this is, is that Mt Gox is strengthening their service, making it more secure, and also knows what to expect in the future and can further prevent these issues from happening.

I doubt 51% of miners will agree to this, as a miner I won't be running software that blacklists coins. The only modifications to bitcoin could be scalability improvements anything else like giving a person control to blacklist coins is absurd.

Going to retire the GPUs, buy asicminer shares and buy Avalon chips for diy asics.  But I think the asicminer shares will become more profitable by the time I get the asics.  Litecoin mining is also an option but since litecoin prices are so cheap its not really worth it to mine them 
@_date: 2013-05-14 13:51:55
I was reading aboout miners selling their old GPUs and hardware just to buy these stocks, and asked about if I should buy asics or stocks in the mining subreddit and people told me its probably more profitable to buy stocks than wait for our bitcoin to depreciate waiting on a asic 3mo from now, I got tired of waiting, considering cancelling my BFL orders to buy more of this stock
@_date: 2013-02-21 15:49:04
You can use btcpak and buy prepaid credit cards on bitmit as well, any other ways that are faster than bank transfer?
@_date: 2013-03-17 19:28:22
this was probably done by a 3 letter agency, if nothing is done this could very well be the end

Uh you could grind shredded money down and counterfeit it, I'm sure I'm not the first with the idea
@_date: 2013-02-22 16:38:42
I wouldnt spend the money on a new video card, if I had the money I'd buy an asic, because it will end up costing you with a video card, at least with the asic, even ordering late you should get your money back for what you paid and a few bucks every day
@_date: 2013-03-04 00:01:06

@_date: 2013-03-16 15:12:05
I have an idea how this happened, if you purchased a private key from lets say btcquick or elsewhere and didnt send the coin to your wallet address its possible someone else had that private key for the 1.5 btc.  Other than that a different ip wouldnt show up if someone is logging in through your ip.  For now on use 2 factor auth and send keys to your wallet address, change all passwords and use two passwords

24 days ago, our additudes were on the up and UP and hope and news about bitcoin was going viral, bitcoin didnt crash to 0, if anything it was a big correction to before we all got easter money to buy coins, and had to pay taxes yesterday.  Bitcoin's value will continue to rise.  So, think of it as, we went back in time 1 month ago, and forget all the lag and panic that happened.  Get back in while the price is still low, it wont stay this low forever.  
Count the candles if you have to, each one represents a day, thats all, just 24 days, less than a month

This is a great idea, I think we also should suggest different payment processors, like coinbase, zipbit, mtgox, bitpay to them as well, business owners dont necessarily have the time to investigate that much, but if you do almost all the work for them, showing them how easy it is to start accepting payments they will probably more inclined to support bitcoin payments.  Also, if bitcoin is accepted at any business, I think there should be a link to purchase bitcoins to use as payment.

Even if there was worry you could split up your coins in multiple addresses for extra safety.  Keep an offline wallet as well.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:06:28
You'll see price rise to 100 by end of the year :-)
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:54:41
Yes contact Coinbase, maybe they will return the favor if you return it, if not is the right thing to do

Wish I could transfer my domain from name.com to name cheap free

I think people should wait until 40-50 to sell at the least, wonder if there are any rich people that will prop up the price to any sell off like facebook did? anyways, 50 dollars a coin sounds much more appealing than 30, I personally think, if you like bitcoin, you stay in, dont sell out, there is lots more potential profit to be made at the current price and rate of increase

Dude u have no freaking clue what ddos is do you, they are syn back and ICMP flooding mt gox

here is the predicted dividends and past dividends per share and some neat graphs, star it 
@_date: 2013-05-04 15:42:07
the price is obsurd 10 of these for over $2000 and only 3ghs
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:05:46
I doubt 51% of miners will agree to this, as a miner I won't be running software that blacklists coins.  The only modifications to bitcoin could be scalability improvements anything else like giving a person control to blacklist coins is absurd.
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:03:07
Let them laugh while we fill our pockets, by the time they change their mind it will be too late for them to profit from bitcoin
@_date: 2013-03-08 17:56:57
seems like 45-50 is where allot of people want to cash out, dont know why they wont wait for the price to gradually rise and make even more? guess people are getting impatient with there old coins lol
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:32:22
yea, as there is more volume, a few million wont even effect the price if enough people switch to bitcoin, what is needed is mass adoption
@_date: 2013-05-26 00:04:18
nope ;\
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:40:09
even so, I wonder if we can follow his change or transactions to other active wallets, this wallet address was one of the top 10 bitcoin addresses
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:23:56
I have no idea?  lol at least I'm security conscious and don't want or need other apps reading my passwords.  By having it plain text you need to trust all apps on your device and that is impossible to trust them with certainty.  Even an app dev could get hacked and someone could push a app update which Android autoupdates that could steal this data and send it to the attacker.  Besides I did the community a good service since most people who use the app don't know it's stored in plain text.  The password should be encrypted client side at least with the second password.

Very doubtful, they will regulate it and tax it If they can
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:03:59
There should be an incentive to be a node like peercoin, its the only thing about peercoin I found interesting.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:18:40
Coinbase.com or wire transfer to an exchange like campbx.com
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:01:21
it may indeed take something like this for him to understand right and wrong lol
@_date: 2013-02-17 15:26:36
The creator of bitcoin would make the perfect ama IMHO :-)
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:47:24
Soon ddos won't effect the exchanges, hope blockchain.info switches to prolexic as well.
@_date: 2013-04-29 00:50:54
All this would take is just one or two banks or credit unions that are pro bitcoin
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:39:42
Hopefully people hold and we see 100
@_date: 2013-04-02 22:53:53
I can vouch for bitfloor being a good place, either wire transfer or deposit at bank of America to bit floor, if u deposit it will be available within 30 minutes (usually) I've seen it as fast as 5 minutes
@_date: 2013-02-26 17:49:21
Bank deposit receipts from bitcoin should work just fine
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:20:22
Script kiddies who can't hack that use premade exploits and botnet code ddossed the exchanges to induce fear to rebuy low after they sold high and triple up on coins
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:06:16
An awful lot of media attention and large buy ins, but it will probably drop a little but not as much as we hope since its gone up so high this time
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:01:06
Wtf is this lying bullshit
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:59:18
transfering bitcoin is instant, it may confirm in 10 min or less with a decent tx fee attached, so you can sell immediately, transfer those funds to you.  If you have funds available just buy coins at current market price on coinbase with Credit card or BTCquick or other quicker methods and repeat, send btc to btc china and sell, make profit
@_date: 2013-03-23 05:31:22
I think TV advertising campaigns would be a great way to increase bitcoins worth and get allot of people talking.  Surely we have a few millionaires and will have many many more.  I want to see bitcoin go viral
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:27:02
Be happy the price dips a bit so people can buy more cheaper and cause price to gain even more :-)
@_date: 2013-03-15 14:32:11
now we need a decentralized encrypted and anonymous social network: 
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:22:18
Down for me, yes coins are safe
@_date: 2013-02-17 21:18:10
Bitcoin is a privacy tool and investment tool.
@_date: 2013-03-20 02:19:44
Btcquick.com allows credit card payments and you can order western union online to ziggap.com
@_date: 2013-02-18 21:33:24
this is how I feel as well, I feel as if I own a stock/part of the internet revolution, paper/physical money is history, bitcoin is the currency of the future
@_date: 2013-02-16 00:28:17
oh yea, thanks for tipping my awesome comment, your awesome btw
@_date: 2013-03-05 19:53:47
very well written article, loving all the attention
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:33:07
damn, dude why the fuck would a hacker want to bring bitcoin down so bad? continuously dossing is ruining bitcoin and his chances the price will go up
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:22:51
fuck mt gox, hate their goddamn exchange, we need a peer 2 peer exchange now
@_date: 2013-02-26 17:04:47
In think seals with clubs does this
