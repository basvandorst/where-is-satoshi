Wow, ok thank you all so much for your advice! I think I’m going to play it safe and keep my money where it is. 
I might buy in each payday what I can afford and see where it goes from there, I’m never going to get rich from this but I’m really enjoying learning more about finance etc from it all. And of course the thrill/ memes! 
Thanks again!

See this is what tempts me. I have a grand total of £50 worth in Coinbase just now and watching it fluctuate is so exciting! God... I make myself sound like a kid at Christmas with my measly amount, it’s still exciting to be a part of though! 
I’m going to add little bits in when I can and hope for a dip at some point to buy in a bit more, thanks for your advice!

Thanks, I will listen to all this advice and play it safe!

I don’t rely on this money for anything, so technically I could afford to lose it. But I think it would be too much of a disappointment to have to start saving from square one again! I’m getting caught up in the hype, thanks for your advice!

Yeah, I don’t think I’m in a position to be taking big risks like this! Thanks for your time :)

I think things are a bit different for us in the U.K., I’m getting caught up in the reddit hype (as usual) thanks for your advice!

If I ever have a significant amount I will certainly transfer to a wallet! Thank you
