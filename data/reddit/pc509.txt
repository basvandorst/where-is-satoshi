My son has my private keys and knows how to use them. I trust him with it. If I go, he's got full control of them. 
If I didn't give them to him, yea they'd be lost. I guess they could get into my wallet and send them to himself... But, without the key, wallet, password... They are gone.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:26:38
Very true. However, many people do. And they are hurting the platform as a whole. Even if you don't use them, they are still causing problems. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:44:12
Yes, it can be. Although it's not mining BTC direct, Nicehash, Awesome Miner, Mining Pool Hub, etc. are bringing in profits. Take away the cost of electricity, and it's all profit if you have the rigs already. 
Take some old rigs, some old GPU's (or newer), and set to mine. Even if it's $5 a day, that $5 a day is profit. 
Going with an ASIC miner (Antminer S9, I believe is one of the better ones these days) and free power, it's worth it. I used to use Slushpool back when CPU/GPU mining was a thing. Just need to pay for the rig and wait for the break even point. Depends on how much you want to invest up front and then wait for the break even point. Which will come sooner as there is no electricity cost.

What if I had the brilliant idea of moving to a Segwit wallet, then waiting for the low transaction fee to finally process and go into that wallet, only to find out Coinbase doesn't support Segwit... I heard Bitstamp does, so I'm working on an account there now. :) 
I keep learning more and more all the time. Usually from dumbass mistakes (Red Forman should have called me a dumbass a dozen times this week related to Bitcoin shit). 
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:26:48
Yes, you did. How much did you lose? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:58:34
I used a low fee and it took a few hours. As long as it's made but not confirmed, it'll go through. It won't ship (you get an email saying that it's been made but not confirmed) until it's confirmed, though. 
Works fine. I have upgraded several computers using Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:59:16
To protect you from yourself. You're not smart enough, but they are. 
If I'm blocked from spending my own money on something, I'll take my business elsewhere. Thankfully for Bitcoin (and other coins), I'm able to spend them on whatever I want, whenever I want, wherever I want (if accepted, of course!). There isn't some Bitcoin Manager sitting at a desk saying "No. I don't think they should spend their Bitcoin on that GPU. Deny.". 
Thank you, Big Brother. I think we got this. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:14:29
Yea. I know there are people like that out there. I'm still starting slow, but learning a lot! Most of the people have been extremely helpful, and will help out a lot. It's a great community. Some a-holes, but overall it's great. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:54:48
I'm far from knowledgeable, but I just sit back and wait. That HODL mantra comes in handy. That, and the text from the cover of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy - "Don't Panic". 
I read the posts from people that seem to have a clue on reddit and Twitter. Others that are very negative about cryptocurrency are usually not good people to listen to. Be cautious, but confident and hopeful for success. Don't bail at the first sign of a dip. 
I'm still learning, and by listening to good people here, Twitter, other places, I'm learning good information and not FUD. Usually, when I head FUD, a week or two later it's proven wrong or was an overreaction to something. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:39:40
Damn, I just looked at this last week and it was MUCH smaller. Pretty awesome to see it grow over time and seeing it from the start.

@_date: 2017-12-30 03:48:22
I gave my keys to my son. He's about the only one that can figure out how to use them if he needed to. 
I like the idea of giving them to someone you can trust, and that will know how to use them in case something happens. Otherwise, it's just a piece of paper with weird words and/or some instructions that they may not understand. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:42:53
Some are in it for different reasons. Some want the easy money, some are interested in the technology, some are interested in the financial aspect, others are in it for the decentralized, accountable nature of it. 
Lots of reasons, and I don't think any of them are wrong.

For both the happy and the sad price fluctuations. Sometimes, you have some great gains, and other times some miserable losses. 
HODL for the long term. If it's an investment, you're in it for the long run. If you're a day trader, yes you're doing it wrong (and didn't do enough research). But, for long term investing, a $300 loss is nothing. 
I need a new pair of pants at least once a week these days.

14,342. Holiday weekend, so I don't think it'll rise too much as exchanges will be harder pressed to gain funds due to banking hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:04:55
Quick question, and I think I'm right - if more people adopt Segwit wallets and process more Segwit transactions, that will improve the network overall, lowering transaction fee's for non-Segwit wallets as well, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:46:22
I like this a lot! :) Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:24:59
I used my word key to make a private key and imported it into Electrum. Sent something at a MUCH lower fee. I wish I would have known this a few weeks ago (bought something for $90, paid $75 in fees). I'm still learning, and I'm learning from my shitty mistakes! :)

He wants her to learn the skills and spelling that he never did in college. She's just making cool collages in school about the different colleges she wants to attend. :) (I'm not serious, just trying to make a joke. I'm sure HODL_Out is a fine, smart dude!). 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:07:51
Damn. I dare you to send me some Bitcoin. :) 
All joking aside (unless you're really generous, then what's a joke?!), that was awesome. :D 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:18:52
We were all the newbies at one point. Educate those that come in, like you did with me. I'm still a newb, but at least I am learning. I think that should be the goal with those posts. It's not a get rich scheme (although for some it has been exactly that). Teach them the technology so they can appreciate that. Well, some will. :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:25:00
What is going on!? 
This is insane! Those that took the advice to HODL are having a great time right now! Look at the posts from the "OMG CRASH!" a week or so ago. Some people sitting back and enjoying the ride and others panic selling. :D

As a guy that has gone through depression, it can be talked about. It's just that it's "man up. Be a man. Just get over it." instead of any actual helping. What sucks is that you WANT to get over it and feel better. It needs a lot more attention and for people to take it serious. I think the "Be a man, get over it" makes it worse. They are putting you down when they say that, and it really doesn't help at all. 
I went to therapy. I wasn't suicidal (I couldn't do that...), but I was in a bad place. She really helped me through it and helped me feel a lot better about myself. If you're in a bad spot, seek help. It's out there, and it can make a big difference. I just wish it was more accepted instead of being seen as a weakness...

If you're 6K down, you're essentially day trading. Buy for the long term. Look at the charts. Up, down, up, up, down, up, up, up, down... Over the long term, you'll be up. There are times when it takes almost a year to recover, but it does and it increases a lot more from there. 
There is a saying around here with 4 letters. It's pretty cliche lately, but it still holds true. Take that advice, and you'll do good. Sell when you're ahead 6K if you're worried. It may be 3 months from now, it may be 2 years from now. Of course, there is also the possibility of losing it all. Hopefully, you didn't invest what you weren't willing to lose. I'm optimistic, but being real - it's still a very volatile digital currency.

What is the fee to send from my non-Segwit wallet to a newly created Segwit wallet? I created the Segwit one, but I'm waiting for fees to drop to send anything to it. I am going to start up with Gemini, though. At least I can start using the new wallet and keep the other one around until I can get things switched over. 
Unless there is an easy way with low fees to send from my non-Segwit to my Segwit that I'm missing...
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:07:02
Because it is a currency. Eventually, it gained the attention that people wanted, and that brought the people in that saw it as a currency and less of a technology. That's what the goal was. The technology side of it is great, and I'm learning more and more each day. But, if the end goal was to just create the technology without the currency aspect, I would have said you were right. But, it created a currency and that has succeeded and it does have value. Some are still in it for the technology aspect, but other have come in for the currency aspect. Both are needed for cryptocurrency to be successful.

Here in Oregon (USA), we had a tulip festival. There's a few pics out there with a similar windmill ( and some of lightning (cannot find pic, might have been on Facebook). I was thinking this painting was in response to that, but it really doesn't sound like it. Just amazing coincidence! 
Very well done painting!

It's what beer enthusiasts do. What I drink and enjoy is good. What you drink and enjoy is piss. 
Fuck all if you get into homebrewing, though. Everything is piss except for some highly customized recipe, full grain using pH balanced mineral free water from the aquifer of a lost land that has been deemed holy by a priest from the holy land. 
Heineken is good beer. It's not great, but I sure as hell am not going to dump it down the drain. I'm going to drink it. And probably enjoy it. :)

I've gotten to the point where these panic sells are just yawn inducing. Just sitting back and holding feels good. 
Patience. I'll probably buy the dip, but even if I don't. I'll survive. 
I feel like The Dude. Just laying back and saying "Whatever, man.". Bitcoin really completes the room.

Uneducated on it. I was the same way. The more I learn, the more relaxed I get about things. For some, it's like day trading. For me, it's the long haul. It's a fun journey so far.

Question about the fees. I sent .017 via Bitpay to Newegg using my Mycelium wallet on Friday using low priority. The transaction fee was .009 BTC, nearly $80. Now, I know this wasn't normal, but I'm wondering why. Am I using a shitty wallet? 
I'm turned off from spending my BTC, but I'm still fine with holding for a while. I'm trying to get my kids into it, too, and they want to. Just want to make sure I get them started right. 
Just need some clarification, make sure I'm not getting ripped off somewhere (the Bitpay fee was very reasonable, around $3.; the network transaction fee was the outrageous amount). 
Any suggestions? 
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:00:05

I am hoping for this. eBay is huge, it'd be a huge boost for Bitcoin. But, like last Fall, I feel it will put a lot of pressure on it. It will need LN to be successful.
This is great news, though! I just hope they do it right, and it helps Bitcoin rather than be something that fights against it.

Just the train station at night when I was there. Everywhere I went in Europe felt super safe with a strong police and military presence. 
The night train to Venice was absolutely amazing after hearing horror stories. Met a couple great people there and talked most of the night. It was awesome. 
Vienna was super safe. Just at the train station that night there were some people that weren't too great. One guy wanted got pretty upset and almost wanted to fight because (from what I could gather) thought I had his documents in a book my son was reading (Sherlock Holmes). 
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:54:25
That's awesome. I really love seeing Bitcoin becoming more of a big deal. Even if some people are thinking of it as a "quick lambo" or whatever. At least it's getting out there and after that initial get rich quick reaction is over, they'll know more about it and hopefully know more about the technology and tell others about it. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:24:25
Oh yes. A physical coin. It’s neat but has no value. I’m good with that.

I was just there last week (posted a pic, too!). I bought a physical Bitcoin coin (just for shits and giggles). Only cash, no cards... I asked if I could pay by Bitcoin... uh... sure. :) 
That was such a fun place. Of course, there was also a news gal on the fountain topless doing interviews with people. That was pretty cool, too. :) 
Vienna was a great place to visit. Really cool. Careful around the train station during the evening. It's true what they say - the freaks come out at night.
