What event will you be covering in Brussels?

What happens if someone doesn't pay you back?
Do you lose everything, give the guy a negative evaluation and that's it or is there some form of insurrance?

Now that S.DICE is gone, who's still using MPEX anyway?
Is there any valuable stock which is listed there?
@_date: 2013-02-27 10:16:53
Can't wait for Bitcoin to appear in Portlandia.

This is not science, it's photoshopping 2 graphs wich have very little in common.
@_date: 2013-05-24 13:03:05
I would also like a bitcoin-based cafepress clone.

SEPA transfer, but with mtgox it was for really small amounts
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:24:01
Herd behavior, panic selling, mt gox lag because of ddos.

Hello, fellow belgian.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:52:12
You could try bitcoin-24, bitstamp, bitcoin.de.
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:12:59
I'd love to buy bitcoin-shaped muffins.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:26:06
It's a good way to learn herd behavior in finance.
@_date: 2013-02-24 11:14:25
Unfortunately, I think that unless you write a proper explanation, that paper will get thrown away.

The only reason people use MPEX is because it was one of the first 'reliable' stock exchanges and because of Satoshi Dice, which is listed there. 
Now that there are other options available for companies wanting to go public in bitcoins, MPEX' influence will lessen I guess. (+ the fact that S.DICE seems to be underperforming) 
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:47:26


This. Now what do you think happens when you and a lot of other users do the same?
@_date: 2013-02-27 10:14:32
I guess that with a £995 price tag, this conference only caters to bitcoin early adopters.
@_date: 2013-08-18 19:51:11
just made an order too!
@_date: 2013-02-25 13:37:25
But these losses could be compensated by the influx of new players. Simple advertising scheme.
@_date: 2013-08-29 13:58:38
if the coins are old enough, perhaps the priority is already high enough

Does anyone know if it's a decision coming from the Dutch branch manager, or if it's coming from Takeaway.com's general management?
@_date: 2013-06-05 11:59:36
You should read further, they talk about that in the article.
@_date: 2013-03-27 08:16:08
You'd have more luck getting this implemented on Duck Duck Go than on Google.

Electrum is easy and fast to set up.

Government or not, they aren't above the law.

I don't get why people still bother to read business insider.
Most of their articles are shitty link baits with almost the same content as buzzfeed and other crap sites like that. Most of them aren't even business related.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:35:51
I have received money from mtgox and bitcoin-24.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:45:48
deal extreme
@_date: 2013-03-14 11:01:53
Yep, that was a lot of different peoples idea.

Hi Ovid,
I've been following some of your posts on several Perl related websites. Funny to stumble upon you on the bitcoin subreddit.
I'm guessing you built this website with Perl. If so, are you by any chance making some parts of the source code open-source?
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:20:57
bitcoin-24 used to be fast and all, but apparently for the last days the admin is overwhelmed by new users :-/
@_date: 2013-06-05 11:14:17
1 @ 10 BTC
@_date: 2013-05-24 15:11:56
400$ for 336 MH/s? The prospective buyer would be better of buying ASICMINER shares or simply buying and holding bitcoins if he doesn't have any yet.
@_date: 2013-07-31 07:04:45
Same here.
It's the only company with which I never had any problems.

This is a nice idea, but I'm wondering: will you place all customer order manually? Or have you guys created a script of some sort which will automatically buy items at specified URLs by filling forms and so on?
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:25:46
Do you have a source regarding this?
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:42:09
You should buy your own chinese restaurant.
@_date: 2013-06-07 05:29:20
of course
@_date: 2013-05-31 12:16:52
This looks nice. Make it a keychain and sell it and I'll buy one.
@_date: 2013-11-07 11:09:16
so many bitcoins... but obviously not enough to buy a decent camera :)
@_date: 2013-08-29 14:42:04
what if there are only 4 ppl playing when it's the next turn?
@_date: 2013-07-11 15:07:09
Are you open sourcing the code?
