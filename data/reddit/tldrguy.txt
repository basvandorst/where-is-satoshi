HODL! You won’t regret.
@_date: 2019-10-01 15:13:15
In what way I’m helping the network?
@_date: 2019-02-15 15:48:44
2017 to 2019 isn’t 3 years but 2. 
@_date: 2019-09-30 12:27:03
Thanks.  Can you elaborate on the fourth option?
@_date: 2019-09-30 22:52:37
Thanks I really want to learn to work with bitcoin cli
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:16:15
I don’t want to use the wallet, I want the full node for two things:
- help to secure the network by participating in consensus
- validate my own transactions

One could say that looking to the past 2000 years there’s enough proof that “facecoin” would win over bitcoin in the long run.

True! The way he explains how human beings work, how they behave and how it relates to bitcoin is eloquent and brilliant.

Whoa thanks, lot’s a material to go trough
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:22:11
Thanks for the explanation, I guess I’ll try running an electrum server. Did you follow any tutorial specific?

@_date: 2019-09-30 15:22:59

@_date: 2019-09-30 11:18:43
