If the fed collapses, and the dollar collapses, will America collapse? Might this have been the plan all along?

If you sell now, you definitely lose. If you wait to sell and it drops more and then you sell, you lose more. If you wait to sell and it goes up, you might even gain some profit. Unless you absolutely need the money to eat, I wouldn't sell right now. Wait at least a month and you're likely to see some profit on your original investment depending on the price you bought in at.

Thanks. I'm aware of gdax, I was planning to trade on their platform and spent the last two weeks studying in preparation. I was waiting until I had a good knowledge base before dipping my toes in, but I guess now I have to wait 4-6 weeks. I'm really bummed out about it but I guess its not my time yet........

what coins are out there that were actually generated fairly, as you put it?
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:02:19
Hey, do you know why I was able to buy coins previously without the i.d.? I may try another way if there's some type of loophole or something.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:08:38
Thanks for the help. I tried several times uploading my temporary paper id to both gdax and coinbase, and every other currency exchange with no luck. I tried opening multiple accounts on coinbase to see if I could buy again using a bank account buy unfortunately my account is already linked and I can't unlink it because I have a transaction pending. It looks like im screwed for now unless I make a new bank account or if I try to get someone else to buy it for me

Does anyone else think this is weird?  First Target, now Walmart?
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:59:20
No but in 6 months the price should hopefully look much different
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:23:51
where do you think it will go from here?
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:42:50
Thats tough luck for anyone who bought at that point,but like I said, at this point in the game, you only lose if you sell. Bitcoin is almost guaranteed to bounce back, you're only guaranteed to lose if you sell now.  
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:32:55
Thanks for the info, I appreciate your input. I've been employing the same strategy and have been making small gains here and there, increasing my position size and cashing out small amounts to help with bills. I have been semi successful and I'm gaining valueable experience but I'm always looking for something new to learn or new info to acquire. All help is appreciated. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:04:43
if you place a limit order at the market price it will charge you as a market order, not sure if that was the case in your situation but it happens sometimes

I didn't understand what OP was trying to say, I just knew it had something to do with coinbase being late to adopt segwit addresses. Given all the rumors about this sub, I think I understand.  The Naysayers were wrong and bitcoin is moving forward to prove them so? I'm still not entierly sure honestly.....
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:18:22

@_date: 2018-02-02 02:33:20
Are you going to sell again to maintain the pattern?
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:40:23
Think long term. My advice to you right now, forget about crypto for now. Think of your money in it as a long lost memory. Come back in about 6 months
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:15:49
Thats good to know, I'll definately work that into my strategy. I generally track all of my trades, the amount purchased for what price and the cost in USD, then once sold the amount sold for what price and the cost in USD, with a side note for the total profit or loss from that trade.  I'm low on cash right now so when I make profitable trades, I'll take 50% and send it to my bank account and reinvest the other 50%. To note, I only increase my position using profits from previous trades and its only increased if I can buy back in at a lower price. It has been working so far, but i'm always looking for improvements.

I did get caught in the bull trap at 16k. Now im waiting for the rebound. I'm not playing with lunch money so I don't sweat it but the point is to at least have a general understanding of how this works. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:02:02
Nice ludens! You must be a kojima fan?  What do you think about survive releasing in a few weeks?
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:15:19
Relax. Take a break, smoke some weed, have sex, play some pocket pool....just take it easy. If you hold strong, you will see better days. Its not so bad, I bought in around 96500 2 or 3 times right before i watched it dip into the 8/s.......whatever, no big deal right its still only up about 1000% from last year?
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:06:34
I'm in the same boat, just remember, people didn't become wealthy without taking risks first. If you do enough research, a calculated risk is not so risky....
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:19:28
I wouldn't say cynical, more like seeing through the fog/smoke and connecting the dots/putting two and two together
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:18:13
Of course you know the writer of the article had to shill the other 5 coins he invested in
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:03:11
You laugh but I saw the dip from 20k before it happened with enough time to sell for a nice profit. I'm still new but I'm at least aware enough to see what is happening and have enough foresight to see certain moves before they happen. I'm not 100%, but its literally not rocket science.  -edit bitcoin went down to 8k, its working.  I don't know about you but I was waiting for this and I bought several times today. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:15:21
Sell when its high, buy when its low......profit?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:09:16
I hope you're right because I have similiar thoughts.

They conveniently kept 100 btc due to "technical issues"
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:36:13
Its more likely to hit 10k before it goes back to 8. Save your fud until after 10k at least!
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:05:20
how long do you think until we hit 4k? I don't see it happening, my guess is we might go to 6k but it doesn't seem likely at all and I think we go back to 15 before we see 6k anytime soon. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:02:46
I think its likely somebody saw some potential in holding the coins long term. They'll probably get lost in red tape somewhere and pocketed at some point, i don't have a lot of trust in government employees considering the huge amounts of fiat that have mysteriously disappeared over the decades. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:30:13
This is exactly what I was about to say. There's a big announcement coming on Tuesday that's going to be bullish for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:58:19
Ah....i'm still new to this, I need to build some calluses on my hands no worries
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:30:07
Op lost 35% because they decided to sell, I think a lot of people are going to want to kick themselves if the market decides to do a reversal in the next few days. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:12:45
Bad move. Not a pro but I would suggest to train your pimp hand and keep it strong for a tighter grip on your hold next time. You should have been buying instead of selling. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:43:54
I don't think so...but I could be wrong. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:18:38
I think it needs to go down some more before it comes back up. Possibly to the 7-8k levels, but I hope I'm wrong. In any case, the sooner we drop to those levels the faster we can go back up.....at least thats how i think it works. Somebody show me the way. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:08:48
The faster we hit 7k the faster we can go back to 15k......i hope.

" It doesn't matter if the credit card charges 24.99% interest and 5% cash advance fee." 
I think its a great time to buy, but at the same time, that is bad advice. In the unlikely event that bitcoin fizzles out, those people will find themselves in a hole. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:05:48
Thanks! Very nice post. I learned a lot from it and cleared some smoke in relation to BCH. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:16:11
I think this is signaling the beginning of a "change in perspective". If someone brings up the "bubble chart", this would mark the beginning of the "institutional investor" phase. People scream that there have been institutional investors here all along, and while there may have been a few here and there of their own accord, we haven't seen anything like what is about to happen, which would be bitcoin adoption by wallstreet on a massive scale. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:56:22
way ahead of you
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:59:46
It really comes down to perspective. Think about it like this. If you sell today, you can have some money for food, but it will be much less that what you originally had. But lets say you wait a whole month and it goes up to 17k, if you sell then, you don't lose so much. Now lets say you weren't playing with lunch/rent money and it didn't matter how long you had to wait, if you don't need to sell, you lose nothing. Were this some other asset you'd have a point but its almost guaranteed that bitcoin hits 20k by the end of the year. If you truly understand the technology, this dip is a good time to buy. It might go lower than this, but thats why you don't play with lunch or rent money. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:14:10

some people come on here and take trolls literally when they say "buy high, sell low"
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:26:44
I think this might be the start of the next bull run back up to 20k.  We might hit a few bumps along the way but its my humble opinion the price will rise consistently over the next few weeks. We may or may not go back up to 20k soon but we will definitely get closer than where we are now. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:37:13
There is another chart that shows we're at the bottom before it shoots up to a new ATH. My point is, anyone can bring up a chart and throw around baseless claims. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:03:52
Exactly. "Hey guys! Check out these new coins!, they're definitely the future! Everyone invest in Skynet Coin and MarkoftheBeast 666 Coin! You can't lose! Unlimited Potential!"
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:55:00
I didn't explain that because its highly unlikely, and if it happens their's not much you can do anyway and you will lose regardless. If you think thats going to happen its best not to invest. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:19:28
Its not necessarily bad. Its a great price to buy in, it just depends on how you look at it. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:11:46
The FUD is real
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:53:21
I still have a lot to learn but it comes down to your risk management. I know it gets said a lot but only play with what you're willilng to lose. You're right, there's no predictions in this, just gauging probability and taking a calculated risk. There should be a new meme around here, Always Take Profits/ATP

you only lose if you sell. If you need that money to eat or pay rent, you shouldn't be playing with it. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:03:46
Its not that simple to explain. I've spent the last several months studying this deeply, and still have a long way to go. I could not possibly explain it to you on a reddit post even if I tried. My advice is to study market cycles in correlation with other cycles and how certain things affect the markets, dow theory, trading concepts, identifying patterns, etc. there is a lot to learn.....even if you're not interested in day trading, those are the tools that help you to see what is going on. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:40:28
It won't indefinitely, but you said it yourself, it works until it doesn't. Train yourself to watch for when its working and when its not.

The tether fud could easily be just pure fud and only extreme noobs are still falling for it. The Dow crashing on a friday signifies potential further losses on the next open, it seems possible that as investors pull their money out of the falling stock market, they may look for other avenues to invest. Bitcoin at 10k is a much more attractive product than bitcoin at 20k. Think about it.....
