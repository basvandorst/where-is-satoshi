No, I'm not that dense, I understand your logic. He might lose on a potential gain, sure. But he is only risking $2 at this moment.

If he doesn't get it back, he still only lost $2.

it's two dollars

Yeah, I mean we're kind of arguing semantics at this point.
For the price of .0017 btc to go from $1 to, let's say, $50 in four years, 1 btc would need to be worth ~$30,000. I think that's pretty close to a best case scenario for btc, and even then he's only "losing" $50, which is chump change.

Great. Me neither. I'd really LIKE to trust btc more and believe that it will be more mainstream as a currency in four years like you say, but I don't see much in the way of concrete trends that suggest this is going to happen. Obviously parts of the media attack btc left and right, but even beyond that, it seems like the very psyche of the btc user is wrong. It is treated as an investment, not as a currency, by most. How is this mindset going to change? People are always so fretful about the price in USD that I just really don't see anything to suggest it can be adopted in any mainstream way.


Can you provide any evidence that causes you to feel this way? Or is this purely faith?

Do you trust BTC more than USD? If so, why? I'm not downvoting you btw
