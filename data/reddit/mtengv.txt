Yea that article is very outdated. Every service here is state-owned and while some bigger private companies like Polar still manage to survive this madness, the majority of our productive sector is crumbling because it is publicly owned and the government destroyed everything it touched, that's why now we have "Clap" boxes, which are essentially pre-filled boxes with imported products that the government itself is importing, with goods that can easily be produced here with the businesses and thousands of hectares productive land they manage to destroy over the years. Even the article you linked talks about the famous incident with PDVAL containers, and the decomposition of tonnes and tonnes of imported stuff that we shouldn't had to import in the first place. Sadly, the recent minimum wage rise was the last straw for a lot of smaller businesses and even bigger companies like Pirelli, which recently left around 700 people unemployed since they couldn't afford to pay them all.
And by the way, even if some businesses may appear to be "privately" owned, a lot of them are owned by people with close ties with the government. There's a lot of shady stuff here that you will rarely see in the media unfortunately. Sorry for the rant by the way.

Oh sorry, when I said "here" I meant Venezuela.

Lol, literally everyone here can do what they want except messing with the government. That's why we are such a violent country, it is complete anarchy.

I don't know where you get this figure from. But as a venezuelan I tell you it is completely false.

Venezuelan here, "hardcore" US sanctions against Venezuela itself only started after Guaido took the interim presidency, before that sanctions were targeted to specific individuals that contributed to this disaster I'm living. You have no idea how much money the people in the government have stolen since Chávez arrived, just take a look at the state of our electrical infraestructure, considering we had the same issues back in 2009-2010 and they spent ~5000 million US$ to "solve it":
• Almost every thermoelectric plant is paralyzed (Planta Centro, Josefa Camejo, Termozulia I, II &amp; III, Tacoa, Pedro Camejo, etc)
• They never finished hydroelectric plant Tocoma, considering they promised it would start operating in 2013 (Odebrecht business btw).
• Guri dam is our last hope, and I believe some turbines are paralyzed.
There is much more to it of course (like buying some shady "generators" from Cuba that no one knows where they are). Now they claim blackouts are because of some cyber-electromagnetic attack or a fucking  sniper, c'mon...
Sorry for the rant but to say that the disaster we are living in this hell is US fault is completely ignorant considering the amounts of money they have amassed in these 20 years.
Side note: US was our biggest oil buyer up until sanctions earlier this year.
