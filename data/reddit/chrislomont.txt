Good point, well supported with evidence, and tracks reality well /s
Being ignorant is not a problem, if one learns once presented with information. It takes being willfully ignorant to not learn once presented with an accurate explanation.
Just for even more fun, here is federal receipts as % of GDP, from 1945 through 2014 [1]. From 1952 through 2014, it only dropped below 15% during the recent recession (three years), and is fairly constant for the past 70+ years.
Next up, typing into google "is comparing household income to government debt reasonable", you find right away that it is not, and for the reasons I pointed out. For example, the Fed can simply buy up debt if needed; households do not have that option to effectively wipe off the debt as needed.
The simple understanding gained from a household is wholly inadequate for understanding central banking. This is econ 101, which usually covers this during the course, to stop people from thinking it's equivalent.
Congratulations,. You, sir, win the double dip of stubborn ignorance for the day.

"Oh come on now....."
Govt income tracks about 20% of GDP. 
And pretending it's a household budget is a horrible analogy, since US debts are denominated in a currency the US controls, and the can do various things if needed to deal with it that a household simply cannot do to deal with debt.
It's always amusing to see the economic literacy in the BitCoin forums :)

Only for idiots that hold their wealth in cash, which no one does. 
On the plus side central banks provide more stability than under non-fiat, provide less volatility, and better buffer against recessions. Read up on the history of recessions before and after various countries changed to central banking. This smoother economic climate allows businesses to plan more accurately, lowering margins on production since there are less currency risks, and the resulting massive wealth does benefit everyone through lower costs and more productivity.

It is around 1/3 of what it once was. Is this also a sign of increased demand?
You're on a higher plane of delusion my friend :)
