credit unions seem to be less concerned with crypto currencies and exchanges.

So far the only thing I saw was a Tweet. Is there any reliable source confirming this ?

just a friendly reminder here, moving that sum into Coinbase/GDAX will definitively put you on the IRS radar, so make sure you track your profits and losses and any other trade you do for your tax report.

if you are living in US keep your eye on the upcoming tax reform, they might demand from you annual reports with your taxes describing your gains from EACH trade.... yes, each !

You don't need to plug the HD out, just use a Linux Live USB to access the content of your disk. It will require some efforts, specially if you are not familiar with it, but it's pretty simple and easy, try googling around and on youtube, there are plenty of material explaining how to do it.

I call this the 'Gollum effect'. These kids think that this whole cryptocurrency thing is like picking a soccer team, "mine is better than yours". In the end they all loose money doing that and blame to other "teams" for some elaborate plot.

I'm curious... How do you buy 20 million in digital coins in a span of hours ? I mean, I normally go to Coinbase or wherever, add my credit card there and press the buy button. Some people even reported here in the past that their banks complained about "large" transactions, locking their accounts, so I was just wondering, how do you complete transactions like that ?

Coinbase auth system is broken, I wrote about it a few months ago
