I'm not sure I agree. 
I didn't have a bitfinex account after they switched to bitgo, but if the 2FA was a passthrough from the bitfinex site to bitgo's, it must mean that someone was able to install server side malicious code at bitfinex that not only captured the private key on the bitfinex side, but was also somehow able to bypass the 2FA and convince Bitgo to sign too, but en masse (Authy for me, not sure what they had in place). 
You could capture a 2FA code entered by the user, but they expire every 30 seconds. If I was bitgo, this would seem like a pretty strong limit on the ability to perpetrate mass fraud. 
I want to know how the 2FA was bypassed. It could have been a pretty elaborate hack. The vulnerability could have been with any of the parties - including the 2FA provider, or some combination of them. I feel more facts need to be known first before calling people 'fucking incompetent' etc.

As a poster below points out, all the early blocks (Satoshi's coins) are pay-to-pubkey, meaning they are vulnerable without spending. That's a big canary in the coal mine.

b) you don't have to "write" to Bitgo to have the security restrictions lifted. You log into their site with 2FA, and you can modify the policies directly. 
I don't get the sense that the people bashing Bitgo in this subreddit have actually ever used them to administer large amounts of bitcoin. You don't "call" or "write" bitgo to change policy, you log in and can do it yourself.
The obvious, least complicated answer is, Bitfinex had set their Bitgo security settings very low, and had no aggregated controls in place. 
The other least complicated answer is, Bitgo didn't have the ability to put security settings / daily limits over thousands of individual wallets, but Bitfinex would have known this as it would be obvious during implementation, and proceeded anyway.
My guess is it actually is on Bitfinex. Sorry.

Even without heuristics or velocity limits, having a second company signing, one with different security, employees, and infrastructure greatly increases security.

Why should it be harder than that? At some point there has to be the ability to change the settings. You can put procedural controls anywhere, but at some point you have to be able to change the settings. The question is if bitfinex was able to change the settings by themselves, which is likely the case, and would have been known from day 1 of the implementation. Without knowing the facts, it's inappropriate to spout off calling people incompetent like this. You are being reckless, people work at these companies and have their income tied to them, and a lot of people lost money as well.

I'm not trolling.  The 10mm auto is a superior handgun round overall.  
9mm has *objectively* causes much less tissue damage and has less penetration than the 10mm.  With bullets designed for full house 10mm auto loads (165gr Gold Dot or barnes bullets), 10mm auto hits are devastating to targets and have enough energy to cause tissue damage with their energy dump, not just the permanent wound channel of the bullet.
Also, statistically if you don't hit an intruder with the first 2-3 rounds, you typically don't hit them at all because the intruder gets behind cover.  Cover, you know the thing that the 10mm auto will blast right through vs. the 9mm...  Read up on real-life shooting incidents, not mall ninja zombie fantasies.   
So yeah, go buy a real handgun caliber and stop repeating the same BS about glocks and 9mm.

I'm sorry, can you repeat the double negative for me?  The modern JHP 9mm is not less functional than the 10mm?  So the 9mm is as functional as the 10mm?  
That's ridiculous.  10mm auto is between .357 magnum and .41 magnum in power level, but works in a semi-auto pistol.  9mm has LESS THAN HALF THE ENERGY of the 10mm auto round.  The 10mm auto has tons of case capacity for powder.  In a longer barrel handgun with a light bullet you are starting to get hydraulic wounding from the energy dump.

The original post didn't mention BIP-62 once.
I would say the OP's points stand. Seg-wit is an over-engineered, expensive and slow to implement solution to the basic problems of native bitcoin scaling, and the terms "hard" and "soft" fork are being used to manipulate what changes do and do not make it into the protocol based on politics and personal benefit.
Transaction malleability was used as a convenient excuse during Mt. Gox when anyone who wasn't a moron knew there was no way it could have caused the loss of 850k coins through customer service transaction search social engineering. Now transaction malleability is presented as some dire issue in need of a fix? Transaction malleability is a non-issue being used to manipulate opinion, just like 'hard' and 'soft' forks.
Can you respond to those points and not strawmen?

Copay for IOS uses Bitpay BWS/Insight servers, which are hosted by Bitpay. Bitpay is a money transmitter and is required by law to turn over any and all information to law enforcement whenever they ask. Advocating Copay over breadwallet because of BIP75 privacy concerns is about the dumbest thing I've ever heard. breadwallet is fine. If you are a privacy nut, install a local wallet on a secure machine and take measures to connect securely.

All modern forms of money exist in more than one place at the same time. This is true regardless of who "owns" it. 
One doesn't "send" money to a place, unless you are talking about mailing physical cash or keys/numbers to control an account. 
You transfer assets to an account or address that is controlled by someone who just happens to be living in a different place. The boundaries aren't real. Money is borderless, unique information. People exist in places, money exists inside of protocols running on networks.

What is this, a Copay commercial?
Copay is made by Bitpay. Bitpay is a money transmitter and is heavily regulated.
Breadwallet is a software development company that makes mobile wallets and is not subject to regulation.
Recommending migrating from breadwallet to Copay because of BIP75 makes absolutely no sense. If anything, find a wallet offered by a company that isn't required by law to wiretap its customers and report that to officials without a subpoena. Bitpay has done a lot for bitcoin, but they aren't the company I would choose if I was a hard core privacy advocate, regardless of whether Copay is open source. Still communicates with BWS and Insight, those are centralized. Breadwallet is not centralized.
Also, this BIP75 thing is overblown, also I think we need to take a very close look at the people promoting the FUD and if that makes them money somehow, maybe because they collect a paycheck from the competition?

This isn't complete bullshit at all. Bitcoin trades on multiple exchanges in many Countries. It's also easy to "take delivery" of your holdings by moving it to a wallet outside of the exchange where you purchased it.
When you trade precious metals, the major markets don't allow you to easily take delivery of the physical asset, and the price is literally fixed every morning by major banks. It's not a conspiracy theory that these banks collude to manipulate the price of gold and keep it artificially low, [it's been proven in court, DB broke from the pack and settled.]( 
[Here's a great video from Bloomberg on what's happening.](
Being able to take delivery of bitcoin quickly makes it impossible to rig prices as is done with gold and silver. If bitcoin ever grows to a market cap where it actually threatens fiat currency, expect the delivery of the asset to become heavily restricted and regulated, and expect the trading of paper versions of bitcoin like GBTC or the Winklevii's vapor-ETF to become easier and tax favorable vs. options to take delivery of bitcoin directly.

I know what you mean, but I also can tell you don't know about credit card fraud. 
Thieves will run 1,000 stolen credit cards through for small amounts, 900 have chargebacks, 100 don't notice, then the thieves will run a much bigger charge on the 100 that didn't notice. Or they will continue to make small charges against that 100.
Bitcoin + credit cards is a lethal combination. The only businesses that do it and survive either allow very small amounts with high KYC, offer it as a form of "overdraft protection", or charge extremely high fees. 
Even then they risk losing their merchant processing and have to find processors that do large amounts of "good" volume to bring their chargeback rates overall under 1-2%.
These guys are charging a 50% fee. That means that most of their "customers" stole financial information and are defrauding people. Credit card thieves don't care if they are paying $900 for a BTC that should cost $600. It's not their money.

1) Do not let this person touch the computer or otherwise tamper with evidence. Whoever this person is probably wants free publicity first, and to help you second. Also, it's entirely possible that your brother was smart and had other private keys or wallet.dat files stashed on the computer that you don't know about. Letting some stranger access the device is incredibly foolish and reckless. E.g. was true/veracrypt installed too? Are there file containers that are encrypted? Is there another partition on the drive you don't see because of the boot order in the BIOS? Does the device contain data necessary to access encrypted data stored elsewhere? You don't know, and probably don't know what I'm writing, so don't let a stranger touch the device!
2) Don't access the computer yourself either!
3) Talk to a lawyer FIRST. Have the lawyer tell YOU the proper way to collect digital forensic evidence based on the jurisdiction that applies to the crime.
4) Based on 3, then you can have the right expert handle the evidence in a manner that won't cause issues when and if the matter becomes a civil or possibly criminal matter.
Don't touch the evidence. Tell your parents not to either. Talk to a lawyer. 
With all of the above said, the address(es) that the friend sent the bitcoin to are the key here. This is can be an open and shut case assuming a) you can prove the friend accessed the computer b) the bitcoin was transferred during that interval and extra credit for c) the bitcoin was transferred to an exchange account that will be tied to the friend when served with a subpoena. 
C isn't even necessary if you can prove a and b. Don't let some c-list celebrity handle the evidence so they can tweet about it and boost their "klout" score. Talk to an attorney first and find out how to handle digital forensic evidence without weakening your case.

Um... except that the overwhelming majority of tax money is redistributed through public sector jobs to the middle class, and the overwhelming majority of money created through central bank inflation is either allocated to public programs that are overwhelmingly used to pay middle class salaries, or are kept by banks as profits that overwhelmingly are paid to employees at those banks who earn... middle class salaries.
Taxation and inflation are wealth redistribution mechanisms, but most of that wealth redistribution is used to create the middle class.
In a financial / economic system with no wealth redistribution via taxation and stealth taxation from inflation, the underclass, i.e. those who are unable or unwilling to provide any value, starve. Without a means to tax or otherwise provide a "safety net", society quickly decays into anarchy and revolution as those in the underclass rise up against their "oppressors" (i.e., anyone who is adding value and earning money in the free market). 
There's a grand total of one example of anarchy that didn't decay into despotism or revolution, and it's a tiny, homogenous monoculture.
This view of "the way money is supposed to work" is myopic. I ask anyone to provide me real data on a system of government and economics that worked in a fully free and open model like this that did NOT collapse into anarchy and then violent/non-violent revolution that ended with despotism or another form of government other than anarchy.

I know it's deeply flawed, but ignoring the need for wealth redistribution and assuming that the new "rich" will be philanthropic and give away their wealth to those in need to a degree sufficient to prevent a revolution is just plain nonsense. Every major empire has fallen because the divide between rich and poor grew too large, regardless of whether or not that divide was "fair" in any individual's opinion. If you look at the calculus of very large numbers of people and how they interact societally given different economic conditions, history is crystal clear. There's a need for wealth redistribution and a greater good, because, well, to offer some conjecture, human beings operate mostly on their evolutionary instincts, which tend to cause tribe-like loyalties and xenophobia. Humans have to be conditioned to be comfortable with cultures and ethnicities that aren't "like theirs", and most people are still pretty primitive. Those of us who are conditioned to accept different cultures and ethnicities don't see the world from the perspective of those who were not conditioned this way, which creates a really dangerous bias and tendency to project a naive, globalist view in areas where it doesn't fit. See the neo-liberal Eurozone, conceived by the spoiled rich. One of the worst strains of this naivety is the theory that if the current power structures in place today weren't there, the world would magically be a utopia; when, in fact, others would just take power.

The 'fluctuations' are a scare tactic. 
Bitcoin has a small market capitalization.
Market capitalization is the value of a unit of an asset times all units outstanding.
A stock, bond, commodity, or anything else with a smaller market capitalization can easily be moved in price.
If there are ten units of an asset, and they are worth $10 each, The entire asset is worth $100 at market value today. It would take very little money to move the value of that asset up or down, simply by buying or selling small amounts.
If there are 4 trillion units of an asset worth $1 each, then it takes a massive amount of buying or selling to move the value of that asset a tiny bit.
In the second example, M0 US money supply, the asset is so big and valuable, you, probably without realizing it, value all other assets using it as a measurement system.
If you receive your paychecks in USD, and your savings is in USD, you are exposed to the volatility and currency risk of USD.
While the USD is stable, it's perplexing to me that people are unable to think about investing agnostic to the underlying currency, and are completely blind to the volatiilty and currency risk of the unit of account used to denominate their investments.
If your payroll and savings are in USD, EUR, or another currency, that underlying currency carries risk. You should diversify your assets not just outside of any specific region's assets, but out of a specific underlying currency as well.
This is why precious metals and now bitcoin are such great investment classes. They are uncorrelated and many times inversely correlated to fiat currencies, which are used to value almost every other type of investment asset, and in the cases of all but physical commodities with delivery, real estate directly owned or otherwise accounted for as 'real', or tangible investments, directly add to the underlying risk of the asset.
If a currency goes bust, guess what happens to the companies that use that currency to do business, and store most of their cash in that currency? Guess what happens to bonds which are debt due in that currency?
This seems so basic. Why isn't this taught in school, perhaps along with critical thinking?

Nice advertisement for Trustpilot. I didn't use them before, and that's especially not going to change after this sleezy post.

[Here, I will cite myself.](
I downloaded the adjusted close for the US Dollar Index (valued against a basket of other currencies) vs. GBTC, the bitcoin investment trust ETF, and looked for correlation.
The R-Squared between the US dollar index and the GBTC fund is 0.0027.  For reference, R-squared values typically range from 0.01 to 1, with 1 (or 100%) being perfectly correlated and 0 being uncorrelated.
0.27% is extremely uncorrelated. There's your proof.

A bitcoin miner running version 0.8.0 created a large block (at height 225,430) that is incompatible with earlier versions of Bitcoin. We rolled back before 0.8.0. It was not backwards compatible, so 0.8.0 created a hard fork. and others are wrong and are making their case around 0.7, when the issue from 0.8.0.

Don't keep money you need to spend in USD in bitcoin. Don't keep money you intend to save or spend in bitcoin in USD.

That's hearsay. Literally.

No, that was a hard fork in 2010. Hard forks are where different protocol rules cause a 'fork' with two different versions of bitcoin's history.
It's not a political term, it means exactly the above and is what happened in 2010. 
It makes me angry to see people creating so much muddy water around soft vs. hard forks. Hard forks are fine if you plan for them. They are what you do when you need to make a change to the rules of the protocol.
A hard fork containing a config change, like max_block_size and a limit on transaction size will introduce WAY less work for users and businesses than SegWit, for example. Soft vs. Hard fork simply describes the nature of what the change will or won't do to the network. The nature of the change itself determines the collateral damage and/or amount of work required to support that specific change.
Again, tired of seeing the water muddied around these words. Please stop making them political. Thanks.

The DAO and a spaghetti coded PHP exchange aren't the same thing, at least we can agree on that, correct (the point)?
