you'd be better off asking in where the mods/users aren't emotional 12-year-olds for the most part

lol want people to not downvote posts criticizing btc? Not gonna happen here. There is for mature and memeless discussion
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:09:27
1. How do you know Ver is behind it? (seems like a lie to me)
2. What promises?
3. What is the current blocksize limit?
4. What are the 2 lies?
You've made no intelligent criticisms of this video and you sound very angry just because someone is criticizing BTC
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:57:56
that's why we have for mature and reasonable discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:05:01
can you explain please. I'm really confused with your point
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:23:30
if they find out a whole subreddit just witch-hunted the survey to downplay bcash, it will be ignored
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:11:02
Oh so balances shown right now aren't really there anymore?
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:47:38
This has been asked 100 times. Use search function 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:46:37
Then why the hell are you asking us if you've already made up your mind? Get outta here
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:15:47

There is a stickied post on this sub with info for new people. Why didn't you look at that?
Get an electrum wallet, write down your seed and hide the paper somewhere safe. Forget about day trading.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:55:40
ok 5-10 sat/B but have to wait 30 hours to confirm
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:26:36

Will be fixed in LN. BTC at this point is not ready to be used as a day-to-day currency. You can always manually lower your fee to whatever you want, it will confirm eventually.

smaller fees but you aren't guaranteed to buy/sell at current price. gdax is like a stock exchange thing. coinbase is just click to buy/sell but has higher fees
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:13:58
That's a deal breaker for me
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:23:44
keep it on ffs
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:24:07
why are you still giving this coin attention? just forget about it

not for long. One bitcoin transaction now uses as much energy as your house in a week
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:23:10
but you miss out on selling forked coins
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:49:46
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:01:59

@_date: 2017-12-03 04:10:01
go to coinbase, make an account, enter bank routing number and account number, buy bitcoin.
deposit USD on gdax (using coinbase account) using an ACH transfer. gdax has lower fees

You'd probably get better answers on mining and other crypto subs
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:59:20
you can set your own fee in electrum.
here's a fee estimate:
I usually set a super low fee (12 sat/byte) and it takes like 12 hours to confirm

yeah that's what I'm looking for: advice
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:57:54
why? I'm just wondering how banks would handle very large cash deposits. Calm down there's no way I could hack anything just by knowing a RANGE of the amount
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:38:26
yes because Roberts made a typo and BUTT made a joke about his typo. Are you even reading these comments?

you should let them know, not us. You're preaching to the choir here
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:51:28
is there a website I can check to see the current fee/time to confirm ratio? Like "at this hour if you set to *x* sat/byte then it will confirm in *y* minutes?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:56:15
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:14:59

GDAX. You'll have to link bank info but fees are very small/zero if you buy on the exchange (select a limit buy)

@_date: 2017-11-26 14:40:34

Again, still haven't gotten a yes or a no.

not really. Are you not preserving 100% of the testicle (cutting it off at 90% and keeping the tube connecting the testicle to the body in the nutsack)?
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:32:08
how are you gonna deposit it into your bank? Small deposits over time or what?
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:43:12
you mean the 12 word seed right? and thanks
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:25:34
many factors, no one knows 100% why. We're in the holiday season with more people getting interested in BTC. That's at least a small factor
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:01:31

@_date: 2017-11-29 01:39:21
wouldn't you want to converse with people who like the 10k price shitposting rather to people who both like and hate it? The stickied thread is literally just for you guys

Oh I love the one Vegeta meme. Even the five. But 20? 50? nah. I guess you're right though, it is a big milestone. I just hope the front page of the subreddit looks semi-informational tomorrow. 
And tell me, when did I get into bitcoin again?
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:28:20
does that bitcoin cash currency also work this way? Would it also have this problem if this many people used it?
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:30:28
