My servers are located in an industrial park and that was the monthly usage before I started there.

Oh ok, my bad.

Net income is about $1100 at the moment, but back in December my net was about $30,000

Not unless bitcoin skyrockets and stays there for a month or two. Right now the difficulty is killing me
@_date: 2018-05-17 04:38:40
I started with 3 AntMiner s9’s and 9 T9’s. I have about 27 btc servers now and 4 dash servers (but they’re pretty worthless).
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:21:45
Yeah I’d be a whole lot wealthier right now.
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:43:58
I’ve got an air intake hole, with a fan to blow it from the hot room into an attic space and a larger fan to remove the hot air from the attic space.
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:16:21
Lol I would have a whole other rack if the market wasn’t in a correction right now :’)
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:42:04
Bitcoin died
@_date: 2018-05-16 23:32:00
True, but it was pretty fun making $1100+ every day. Now I can barely pay my electricity and might have to shut my servers down.
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:31:38
@_date: 2018-05-17 13:08:23
Around $2700-$3500 XD
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:19:18
About $25,000. I started off with 12 servers and slowly worked my way up to 25.
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:01:12
Hell I’ll try and sell them in the next few months for $150-200 a piece. I’m still trying to hold on to them though. They’re just not paying the rent (or the electricity).
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:03:09
It’s possible to start from the very bottom and work your way up, it may take a few months though. But servers are cheaper than ever right now so it’s a pretty good time to get into mining (if the price will go up soon). There’s hope, but it will just take a little bit longer.
@_date: 2018-05-29 20:42:53
I use Bitcoin.com pool. Some pools pay better than others, but I like the automatic switch from BTC to BCH. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:50:51
It does, although, I would wait for the market to go back up. I might have to shut them down because I can barely pay for my electricity at the moment.
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:14:08
I don’t have my hard wallet with me at the moment, but I’ve made about $110,000 in the past year of mining.
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:41:53
I’d be deaf if that was in my house lol. I have a separate office space close to my house.
@_date: 2018-05-29 20:54:46
Well actually I have a whole load of fire hazards in the hot room, so no worries there. And there are plenty of cottonwood dust bunnies lying around. (I’m thinking of making my own clothing line)
@_date: 2018-05-29 20:52:55
Take cold air in through the front of the servers and push the hot air outside
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:27:17
Yeah I’m actually about to have to shut down myself, I’m only making about $900-$1,200 profit a month. (Certainly not what I’m used to) I’d like to keep them up for as long as I possibly can, but the minute that number reaches $0 I’m switching them off...
@_date: 2018-05-29 12:14:37
It’s fluctuates around 315-340 TH/s
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:59:12
Wow! I believe that my electricity is only 9-12 cents a kW
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:47:04
Sorry, my mistake. Server is a slang word that I started using. I have a separate ‘office’ that’s in an industrial park. It has 2nd phase power. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:49:06
That’s interesting I might have to look into those, I’m getting very tired of dealing with BitMain’s customer service.

I got a loan from a family member and was able to pay them back after 5-6 months of mining.

You might want to run your first 10 or so in your house until you can afford rent at an office space or an industrial park. (My rent is only about $925)
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:39:27
These are my statements from a couple of months ago, but nothing has really changed.
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:55:51
Actually all of the servers that are disconnected in the picture are the dash servers. The rest are BTC/BCH miners
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:12:33
Yeah in some places, in others not so much. I still need to fill that bottom rack up though.
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:58:31
I made my initial investment back in 4 month when I started. And December was a very good month for mining; at 350 Th/s I was making close to $1100 a day. Now I’m only making about $200 a day, but it’s still enough to pay for rent, electricity, and a little bit on the side.
When BitMain released the D3 they destroyed the mining market for dash. Whereas before it was released mining calculators were saying you could make about $1600 monthly with one.
@_date: 2019-03-27 18:08:04
You’re setup reminds me a lot of [mine]( when I had it.
@_date: 2018-06-09 01:01:58
Yes, very much so. It would be considered more of a long term investment with a high risk at the current moment.
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:14:52
Idk, it’s the third street down from the overpass, just before it starts to get sketchy. I don’t really go to Dallas that much, I live closer to Fort Worth .
@_date: 2018-06-09 00:57:55
It’s 2 phase electricity in an industrial park, but I do have breakers flipping all of the time. Oddly enough it’s not the breakers that the miners use. . .

I paid about $1,300 for T9’s back in mid 2017. Of course that’s when the difficulty was low and the price was high, it should take you about 9 months for that thing to pay itself off. I only make a little over $80 (gross) per month per server atm. So I’d say that’s a bad deal considering where the market is at right now.
