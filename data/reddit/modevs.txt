I would expect that to be a good thing, being overwhelmed with offers of things you can purchase with your crypto. 
Eventually the topic would just detach into its own sub for that specific purpose (presuming there isn't one already).

Presuming you read the article your definition of nothing special and mine vary widely. 
It sounds like he led one hell of a life and is just trying to exist in peace now.

I'd encourage you to do your own digging (it's not hard). 
In a nutshell they've been accused by waves of businesses that claim they received phone calls encouraging them to advertise on Yelp so the salespeople can help them out in vague and review-related ways, and then seeing more negative reviews show in place of their positive reviews when they didn't cough up the advertising money.
This seems to vaguely revolve around their fraud filtering algorithm, which supposedly has been reviewed independently by some folks at the Harvard Business School. For what it's worth, I'm less than impressed with that "study". I feel a true third party review would be up in their server logs and phone calls on an unadulterated basis as is warranted if Yelp really wanted to dispel all these allegations.
Yelp for their part has claimed repeatedly ([this AMA thread]( is relevant) they don't do this sort of thing both on their blog and to media but what I think makes many people suspicious is the sort of pliable doublespeak they often use in their replies and in court where they've argued something along the lines of "even if we did that it wouldn't be illegal.". 
All said, all the bad press has made me decide to permanently stay away from that company in every capacity possible -- a concept i'm sure a review site is well aware of.
