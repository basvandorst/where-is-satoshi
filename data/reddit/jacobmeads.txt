If that is the case, what do you expect the appropriate fee to be?

I feel this is a bit short-sighted, is this not an issue that should be dealt with once if possible? At the least in a way that makes bitcoin economically sound after going through a few halvings.
Personally I dont think I am alone in thinking that $1.85 per transaction is far too high

Exactly, and who now can into the future and say that 1mb, 20mb or 4gb is enough. 
The longer bitcoin is around the harder it is to get consensus for a hard fork it seems. 
Something like BIP100 where the limit can be changed without another hard fork seems like a better solution

If bitcoin undergoes strong growth and adoption takes off then the security of the network should also grow with it. Lets say we have a lightning protocol up and running, and most transactions take place here, does this not reduce the transactions on the blockchain and thus reduce the reward available to miners, thus reducing the security of the network?
100 million transactions a day on the blockchain with a 10cent fee each is huge incentive for miners, especially if this can continue to grow
240,000 transactions with a $5 fee is attractive, but has an inverse relationship with growth, isnt growth what we want for bitcoin?

I suppose one could do the same thing with an online store, say amazon stores a private key and requests payment, as long as the payment is headed to the correct address and the wallet can find the corresponding order though some amazon api? then the payment goes through.

As for
3) I'm not sure how it would be implemented, but basically to make sure the amount on the bill is what they are trying to debit.
2) When you set up the direct debit, the company would provide an address to make payment, this signature would mean that the funds can only be withdrawn to this address, making the company accountable.
In this example i used a utility company, as the holder of ther wallet, you would have to decide if you trust this company enough to set up the direct debt, if they are a large well established company this shouldn't be a problem, if not, then paying manually is probably a better option.
The limit per month is a great idea, I should have thought of that.
