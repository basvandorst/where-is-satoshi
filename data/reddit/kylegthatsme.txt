This reply is a beacon of intellectual light in a dark subreddit. 
Thank you.

I predict extreme volatility with limited liquidity. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:42:23
I thought it would pop. Of course I did not know any number though. 
Spoiler alert: The market will go stagnant and than suddenly the people making those huge transactions on the exchanges will sell off coordinately. Than the exchanges will freeze, as they always do, and the small fish get slaughtered.  
Keep telling yourselves that you will just wait for it to drop some then sell, those opportunities are like unicorns... 
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:16:57
I guess your assumptions are true, not entirely applicable though. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:02:33
I would bet that not even half of the "bets" made on the stock market are that it will go up. 
Anyone with any experience in equity trading will tell you that money can be made by any movement. See puts, straddles, short selling, condors, butterflies.. to name a few.

I disagree. 
From the article:
"So there is a fixed supply of a commodity and a demand for that commodity (is it downward sloping? Probably not because speculation can easily overwhelm the use of bitcoins as anonymous payment method). A perfectly inelastic supply curve with a volatile demand curve is a recipe for wide price fluctuations of bitcoins in USD. If one takes chapter 17 of the General Theory, the bitcoin is an asset with no income (q = 0), no liquidity premium (l = 0), some carrying cost (c &gt; 0, because one needs a computer and electricity to use them, even if in physical forms), and an expected capital gain or loss (a &lt; &gt; 0), so their expected rate of return is:
Rbc = abc – cbc
Put simply, Bitcoins are purely speculative assets. There are websites that help calculate if mining bitcoins is expected to be profitable, but, as one website notes: “Extrapolating bitcoin difficulty or price is pure voodoo.”"

Asic miners will always be profitable after the initial cost. I don't think what your saying accounts for the hash rate increase from product generation to generation.  the next gen from bfl and fnc are x100 timers faster. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:13:38
Over Speculation.

You cannot compare Cyprus to the growth rate of a much larger nation pre-internet.
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:48:01
lololol every stock pays dividends huh??
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:07:58
All Asic miners cost nearly nothing to run. I know that personally. What would happen to the devices that you said will disapear? Not trying to be a dick but i think you are totally wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:10:35
Is this not because gold mining is luck related, you could find no gold. 
btc is different in that you are just providing a proof of work. Using pooled mining, of course, as an example.
Either way it is a VERY interesting point.  
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:01:42
The traffic has to come in and out
Exchange = traffic. Considering how much hardware is required for other large exchanges and how so many of you think BTC is going to the moon, the traffic would be outrageous... 
They do not have the infrastructure to handle the traffic of a potential global market. Their best case scenario would be for the proposed exchange to outgrow their capabilities. 
FYI I have a MS in Computer Science and I work everyday in the field of "large networks"
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:04:35
for a second time you missed the "well thought out" portion. 
you are applying a trivial universal statement in attempt to refute a well thought out argument. 
for example, from the article:
"This digital so-called money will not be used to facilitate exchange. Nobody is going to be getting rid of an asset that has moved from $2 to $1,000 in one year in order to buy pizzas. People want to hang onto it, refusing to sell, in the hopes that it will go to $2,000. This is the classic mark of Ponzi scheme psychology. People do not buy the investment for the benefits that the investment provides as an investment, in other words, because it is a capital asset. They buy it only because it has gone up in price. They expect this to continue."
That seems rediculioisly true to me. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:47:32
Can you only make calls? No puts?
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:18:40
Screenshots. . . Why create a new account to tell us this?
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:43:51
Every single one of you is buying BTC for profit, not for their use as currency. Be honest with yourselves. New buyers will not see the profit incentive that the current holders did due to the intense price spike. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:40:07
Mining would require way less infrastructure. I am speaking in terms of the required large scale network for the exchange to use. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:22:33
I am also TOTALLY lost as to what he is asking. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:51:59
Well if you need a tv you picked an odd currency to buy it with. If you would of went TV shopping last night you could of got 10% more tv. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:32:07
I can agree to that but i still think your "5 gh and under will be turned off" is wishful thinking. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:25:39
I thought this was the most truly informed opinion I have heard yet. 
Best Part:
"One may note that what gives value to bitcoins is not that there are redeemable in dollars. They are not redeemable (their quantity can’t be reduced by converting them into something else). What gives them value is that people are willing to pay a lot of dollars for them (or tulips if you see where I am going with this: people are trading virtual tulips that grow out of thin air and never die).
The structure of the payment system, not bitcoins, is actually what makes the bitcoin project so successful."
Bitcoin is starting to remind me of collateralized debt obligations. Maybe it has something to do with all the amateurs calling it "fool proof". 
Most of you are forgetting that there most be cohesion between the current monetary system and the bitcoin utopia you all are predicting. 
My advise to all of you, get out now! This is coming from someone who has a MS in computer science and the previous :) owner of ~50 BTC. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:48:10
Better yet! Go on ebay and buy my mining equipment! You could be be a millionaire!!! 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:31:02
I got some great mining hardware on ebay!!! You will be a MILLIONAIRE when BTC reaches 1,000,000!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:23:07
I have some mining equipment on ebay you might be interested in. :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:11:02
Pics or shens. sorry. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:37:34
I have heard of others having  a hard time moving in and out  that quickly. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:48:27
Why do you WANT to buy a tv with bitcoins? 
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:41:10
change your passwords to everything and reinstall os. if you are using linux its very easy. 
better safe than sorry.
btw your title was really confusing. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:52:28
I like it. I like it a LOT. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:56:55
"Why don't financial writers compare facebook or twitter stock to tulips?"
I am sorry but if the answer to this question is not immediately evident to you, you should not be "investing" in anything.  
" If twitter went under tomorrow they would have almost no physical assets and your stock would be worthless."
Twitter most certainly has assets. You can look that up ya kno? :)
Its great you are interested in BTC but keep reading man. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:30:03
I have never seen gold move 40% in a day
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:51:14
That does not address how it is NOT a Ponzi scheme. You attempted to break down one sentence with an absurd universal statement. 
I said, "Well thought out"
I don't necessarily think it is or isn't but was more interested in hearing the counter argument.  
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:40:37
I doubt they have the infrastructure to be a "hub" of anything. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:18:57
It seems to me that the opposite is true. Think credit card companies. 
I don't know though, I just think that there will always be a way to charge a little extra.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:14:39
Yep. Greed. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:10:21
This shows that bitcoin is not going to get rid of "fees".
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:45:49
The internet gods favor you. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:20:55
What you are saying is logically true if not for the raw scale difference in both hash rate and distribution numbers from generation to generation. Your nuts if you think the difficulty is going down.. Its designed not to. Read the original paper.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:36:25
Doesn't the person buying the miner use it?
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:37:18
It would be interesting if someone were to post a well thought out counter argument to this. Seriously what in there is specifically wrong?
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:49:52
I predict extreme volatility and very very very limited liquidity until it trickles down to its true value... 
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:21:45
I placed my bets a long time ago. IMO the pop happened. The fireworks are over. 
I think the new infrastructure is a result of the sudden price movement and not a result of the true value in the system.  What you are saying is a cause/correlation thing. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:07:17
Where are you getting transactions filled that quickly?
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:16:46
Be careful. Before you buy anything ask yourself what if i just bought coins. What price would you buy a bfn 8gh jalapeno for? just wondering 
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:10:36
Could you not just buy coin instead of rigs. That 5gh for x dollars will only mine y coins. I think with &lt; x dollarsyou can get  &gt; y coins just buying. Difficulty could increase less rapidly but at the current difficulty most 5-8gh rigs won't mine their value. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:49:16
Sorry, but I don't understand what you are saying. Assets in the ground as in gold not mined? Or as in the value is "in the ground"?
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:31:22
I remember when i was 15 and thought i had market timing down too. Good luck. With that mindset you will tickle profits 
until you get hosed.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:06:02
Or this: 
"Bitcoins are not increasing the division of labor. They are bought on the basis that somebody can get into a game of musical chairs. Instead of running out of chairs, leaving one person the great winter, the promoters started with a given number of chairs, and then they hoped that lots would come and bid on the chairs. "If we issue it, they will come." This took place. The promoters creators are now very rich, as measured in dollars."
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:11:26
look at the view count. 
seems oddly low. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:49:05
"The market is literally valuing their gold assets in the ground at 0, which is insane."
I don't see how this is true.
