What are the main differences between FPGA and ASIC and what would scale better? Also, why are ASCIs in "limbo?"

Silk road staff and $80 million.

It doesn't make sense for these ASIC manufacturers to even sell their products. I'd keep them for myself as well.
Anyway, the 7970x3 seems easy enough to do. Can you not go for x4?

Awesome thanks for the info! It currently seems better to invest $10,000 USD in mining equipment than buying $10,000 USD worth of bitcoins, if you mine for a year. 17x better in fact, if I'm not misunderstanding this. Is bitcoin currently over priced? I'd assume these differences would have a smaller spread.
edit: I didn't factor in the increasing difficulty in my calculations. Yeah, that changes everything given the changes over the past few months. No way you can make money mining.

Is it possible to get a hold of these Avalon  Or all they all sold out?
edit: Well, they seem to be out of stock.

I'm assuming some of the mining software will allow you to set up clusters (for multi box set ups). Is this the case?

Why are you spamming all of the reddit posts related to this, with the same comment?

Do you need an active internet connection to mine? Or only once in a while to upload mined blocks (I'm a compsci, but I haven't read into bitcoin since the original paper a few years back. I'm assuming you mine blocks)?
