The key is faith.  Faith that your money will still have value tomorrow.  Not "whether you can pay taxes with it".  People are waking up to the fact that inflation and hyperinflation are not natural and are being done deliberately.  They're beginning to understand that they are being robbed.  Bitcoin's future is far from certain, but at least the world finally has a way to keep central bankers' hands out of their pockets.

Unfortunately, this also means there's a chance they'll screw up and leave you holding something worthless.

What would be considered a large donation?  I think the changetip limit is $25 right now.  Hopefully you wouldn't get into trouble accepting a bunch of small tips.

Not a bad idea, but what i had in mind was a charity that has never accepted bitcoin.  Who could ignore hundreds of dollars worth of bitcoin donations?  Certainly they'd do some investigating at least.  They might even decide to start accepting bitcoin on their websites.  Thus facilitating additional bitcoin advertising to all the regular dollar donors.

I'm curious as to the reasons why it's increasing in value so rapidly.  How are you using it?  I assumed it was still mostly unheard of.  Who accepts it?

I hope you're right.  I think bitcoin is certainly the greatest challenge they've seen in centuries, but the banks hold more sway over government force than anybody.  This is going to get very interesting.

Right, because of all those companies who desperately want their customers to die in a fire.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:23:35
A massive drop in price is what we need.  I honestly think that's the only thing that will force the hand of the miners.  When mining becomes unprofitable, they'll be forced to reconsider the status quo.  
Then again, a price drop might also convince Core that they need to deliver a true compromise that includes a hard fork.  I think it's too late to coordinate a safe one though.  
@_date: 2019-03-14 01:49:54
Is it though?  Wouldn't the government have to admit that their money was garbage first?

Most of it is money leaving Bitcoin and going to Ethereum.  It'll probably continue until segwit/lightning are up and functioning in production.

Nope, pure speculation at this point.  Still, another Gox is bound to happen again someday.  I just hope everyone remembers to be careful about leaving large amounts of cypto on exchanges.
