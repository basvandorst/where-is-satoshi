Now you are comparing a psychologically addictive crutch with a 50 year-old counterculture behind it and mass use by 40% of everyone in the Western World and 10% of everyone in Asia to bitcoin.
You can't sell bitcoins for cash on the street then walk 20ft into a store and buy some food in a transaction that is virtually untraceable except by video cameras or informants.
What are you doing right now, dude? Get real.

You're not routing any bitcoins around the ban in any way that will be able to take on the big banks. Stop deluding yourself. If other nations follow suit, bitcoins gross value will be horribly diminished. It may be wise to sell a certain amount of your coins if you believe other nations will follow suit.
Moves like the one China made prevent bitcoin from getting into the hands of normal people, which is where you are going to get your uber-returns. How can you act like this is a good thing? It's just insane. Insane.

Your words are confident enough to convince me.

I understand that where there's a will, there's a way, but to act like this kind of network will make even 1% of the original gain bitcoin stood to make in China is delusional.
This is a terrible thing for bitcoin in terms of its future valuation. What kind of mental gymnastics are people pulling to try and convince themselves that ~1.2 billion possible bitcoiners being reduced to ~.01 billion bitcoiners is a good thing?
WE WANT THIS IN THE HANDS OF ORDINARY PEOPLE, WE WANT IT EVERYWHERE.

People still use bank accounts and *credit* in a *huge* way. It really boils down to that. Too much risk for the average Chinese person to try and get around it. Unless ofc they have bribed the right people; China is notoriously corrupt.

I don't think anyone knows China, to be honest; not even China.
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:28:10
Those things are not happening in China. Sorry.

I'm not well educated enough on this to refute your point on the altcoin issue. 
My primary point here is that China definitely has the means to freeze the bank accounts of the vast majority of people who are trading in bitcoin and giving them lengthy prison sentences. Perhaps long-term there will be an upside, but I don't see missing out on ~1 billion people and the world's fastest growing economy as a good thing for bitcoin's valuation within the next 20 years. People are talking like we're already 30 years in the future and you can bump smart-watches and exchange coins in some quantum-secure-cloud database.
The average person in China is lucky to have online banking and a mobile phone with 3g wi-fi. They aren't as sophisticated as you, and they are highly unlikely to react how you think they are going to, seeing as you are implanting your advanced knowledge into their unknowing minds. They are seriously 10-20 years behind you.
Too many coins are about to go public. I fear bitcoin's days are numbered. I'm just trying to come in here with a dose of reality. If the Chinese government makes it illegal, 99% of miners/users are going to stop doing their thing, and the world's fastest growing economy will pass on bitcoin.

You're trying to be validly contrarian and failing miserably.
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:44:40
People are such fools.
If China is serious about this, all they have to do is immediately freeze the assets of all those who are found to be dealing in bitcoins and throw them in jail for 5 years for "Subversion of the Wonderful People's Economy."
If they are serious, it's dead in the water. Count China as a loss. Stop the mental gymnastics. Don't let greed make you delusional.

The world sans ~1 billion people, though.
