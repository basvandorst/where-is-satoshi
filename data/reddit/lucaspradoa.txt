Gavin, while both you and Andreas Antonopoulos always mention "regulatory clarity", I feel that you might have different perspectives on what that would be exactly. Andreas made his position quite clear at the Canadian Senate. Can you explain what kind of regulation you believe Bitcoin could actually benefit from?

Andreas fucking Antonopolous  "doesn't really seem to genuinely understand the technical issues &amp; details of bitcoin" oh well if HE doesn't I really have no damn clue who does

Not necessarily. It will *probably* crash after this huge wave but it aways comes back stronger. So you could loose money in the short term but then get it all back in a year or so.
