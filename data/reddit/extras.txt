I'm with you, coinbase is the way to go for me too.

I still have to say "don't feed the bears". While you are correct in saying that you are buying processing from another user a good business operator would reinvest their profits into more GHs, adding more processing to GHash.
I think they've proven to be good business owners, with terrible ethics relating to double spends.

There are still penalties for breaking their laws. You also can't advertise your business by any other means than word-of-mouth, so getting new customers would be a major hastle. The crypto market is still a very limited segment of the population, certainly not anything that a small business owner could sustain themselves on.

I'll take that action. 
Is there currently a bitcoin escrow service that could be used for this?

Seriously. They may not be who they once were but they are a solid company with a ton of extremely valuable intellectual property. 
When 90% of the fortune 100 runs on your architecture you have very little to fear.

Like playing horseshoes with hand grenades. AWS is almost impossible for the beginning web developer.

That's the reason I'm here! 
I fiddled with it before, thinking of coming back now. My wallet is currently 151 weeks out of date...

Typically such actions lead to a correction. We'll see.

I can't emphasise this video enough to show how bitcoin works:

Setup a wallet and follow the guide below!

Keepass, and I actually prefer it.
Open source or nothing.

No problem at all! Feel free to post or PM me with any questions about it.
You don't necessarily need to set up the full software wallet either. I do run the Bitcoin-QT client on my desktop, but I use the [Bitcoin Wallet Android app]( on my phone.

By the way, thanks for the stats. Honestly that's why I'm using your pool.

A crash at this point doesn't seem plausible. It has gained far too much attention and legitimacy in the last week. 
This drove up spending, and has led to a correction. I don't think "crash" is the right word.

The bitcoin transactions I have done have occurred almost sub-second. Getting them added to the blockchain and confirmed, yeah that can take a few minutes.
I don't really see it being such a huge problem right now. I suppose one could make a wallet application to allow double spending, but then you would need to run from one bitcoin merchant to another in less than the amount of time it takes to be added to the chain, correct?
