The politics of bitcoin is the politics of radical neutrality. I think this is a meta politics because it enables existence of all first-order political positions simultaneously without bias, even those which are at odds with each other.
Radical neutrality can have political bias built on top of it, just like centralization and transaction reversibility and regulation can be layered on top of bitcoin as an additive. 
Importantly, the opposite is not true. 
You cannot get back to decentralization or nonreversibility once you have centralization and reversibility.
This is why it is so important and fundamental to preserve Bitcoin's core design principals. They are provably fundamental because they cannot be built from their alternatives.
This is also why we need to fix pure anonymity - we can add identities in a higher layer but once we forego anonymity we cannot get it back. Same for fungibility.

Bitcoin is not an attempt to solve the problem of untrustworthy operators, just to remove barriers to being forced to use them.

OK but I think the strongest form of this argument is that any statement that provides certainty about the imposition or omission of regulations would have fixed the problem.
What this implies is that it is the *expectation* of onerous regulations that are expensive to comply with and even more expensive not to comply with which is the root problem. At least in the US.
It's worth noting that, in many other countries in the world, there is not such fear, uncertainty and doubt about the govt reaction, even when there is no explicit ruling on Bitcoin's regulatory status.

The ASIC vs general purpose arms race will never end so long as the financial rewards for better hardware exceed the cost of custom designs.
What proof of work algorithm design is becoming is a search for a formal, programmatic description of the full capabilities of general purpose computers. It is easier said than done. The PC benchmarks are unsuitable because there is no quick way to verify the work.
What we should hope to see is POW that matches the machine profiles we want to see built for the mass market. This will maximize the opportunity for broad based mining populations as well as fuel the technology growth.

I don't have convincing amounts of numeric data about compliance costs that I can share if that's what you were after.
I am claiming that screening criminal activity takes a superlinear investment to comply, as a function of the number of parties and the transaction throughput value. What happens in large banks as they comply with AML legislation is that they apply an increasingly broad strategy of data mining based on rules and ad hoc requests from law enforcement. Depending on the rule category, they have compliance response deadlines measured in hours or days.
This is still workable while the number of "financial institutions" are small (i.e. hundreds or thousands) but the larger the operation, the more people who have access to this financial surveillance (as the AML compliance departments in banks swell), multiplied by the proliferation of independent transaction brokers (i.e. all of us) the less reliable and more expensive this is. Theoretically it can work but in practice privacy is completely lost and every additional party to the surveillance process is an additional risk factor for mistakes, fraud and corruption.
Regulation at the point of a third party who bears some kind of risk proportional to the value of the transaction (or themselves becomes a risk) is always going to result in a proportional transaction cost as they share the amortised cost of that risk with the transacting parties (plus profit). 
Bitcoin does not involve third-party or counterparty risk in the most elemental transactions, therefore at that granularity there is a cost basis that is fixed independently of the value being transacted and is therefore scalable to larger numbers of parties who do not need to be trusted.

Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures calls this "megatrend" the *replacement of hierarchies by networks*. 
It is very much found in nature, like ant colonies, because the scalability comes at a much lower per unit expansion cost and it requires low collaborative cohesion if the incentives are aligned.

I understand that was a joke but... math:
Current hash rate is about 78PH/s. (7.8e16)
Estimate of Google machine: Intel quad core xeon E5530  @ 2.40GHz can do 7138070 H/s
7.8e16 / 7138070 = 1.09e10
So Google would need 10 Billion machines just to get to 50% of today's hash power and I doubt they have even that many machines, let alone it being 0.0001% of their capacity.
edit: quick search suggests Google has closer to 1-2 million servers.

They can hold Dorian while requesting real Satoshi signs a given message but that could have been enabled by Dorian by setting up the temporary ability for a conspirator to sign as Satoshi.
Real Satoshi will not agree to something that could compromise his identity, so asynchronous communication is almost certainly required.
Also, if Dorian is not Satoshi then why would he go through this elaborate exercise? Would he have faith in a benefit to himself?

That is true for Bitcoin, but actually large transactions cost the card company more than small ones because there is a percentile risk of fraud. The fraud impact is proportional to the size of the transaction so therefore the cost basis of the insurance against this risk must be proportional.
This is why zero trust scales better than any system with third-party risk.

Except if you're going to make paper wallets you may also wish to keep your private keys off the internet which means NOT using a website to generate the codes. 
Maybe it's paranoid, but I would recommend USB booting an offline machine from a trusted linux distribution, load the single HTML file which contains the paper wallet software and print over USB (not wifi) on an offline printer. This ensures your private key never goes online or onto a device that can leak your private key to an online attacker.

By a difference in fundamental definitions I meant the definitions of words. You and I have ironically hit exactly this problem. When you read "fundamental definitions" you thought I meant propositions (things that are accepted to be true or not). In my mind I was trying to convey the necessity of using words to mean the same things. It doesn't matter if "blue for me is green for you" as long as when you say sky I understand you to mean the stuff you see when we go outside and look up, and not mistake it for some kind of vodka.
You then go on at length to point out that the problems that I list are not impossible to overcome. This is absolutely correct, however this is not to say that the effort required is worth it. 
The colloquial phrase "agree to disagree" does not require that all these things are impossible to overcome, just to acknowledge that the practical matter of finding 100% alignment in them is understood to be a gap that ultimately is not fruitful to attempt to bridge. 
Agreeing to disagree is not a full assault on predicate logic such that paradoxes run riot and the universe implodes (note my use of [tone]( ) it just means we accept a lack of agreement whatever the root cause.
Indeed I'm starting to get the strong impression that you and I can agree completely, if only we can discover each others meaning, to merge our [ontologies]( I'm guessing this could take a very large number of words, so forgive me if I do not insist on debating with you and suggest that we too "agree to disagree".

The importance of broad-based mining populations is that the possibility of collusion is lower and the corrupting influence of concentrated power (e.g. Governments) is less likely when there are more individuals mining.
Remember too, the protocol is only developed if it is implemented AND the miners run it. Fewer miners with bigger operations each have a greater influence over the version of the protocol that confirm transactions. 
It's an important kind of jury selection and we don't want it too heavily biased.

You are right in that Ant colonies have a centralized point of failure but the rest of your points are just analogies to human royalty. The individuals act independently and the colony-wide behaviour emerges from their aggregate activity.
This can be replicated in computer simulations without a queen.

This is very challenging and unsettling for most people. It seems like people know this is true but they hesitate to revolt.
This is why bitcoin early-middle adoption will gain traction but only in combination with solid, convenient execution. 
We need the bitcoin equivalents of Google, Netscape, Amazon and iTunes to ensure that this heavy disruption has reliable brands that provide tangible value.
I see loads of self interested entrepreneurs all scurrying to fill this void. What the community can do is call bullshit when there are scams or poor performers.
Personally I think the many shortcomings of Bitcoin today are rightly called screaming opportunities and plenty will get rich on them. 
Until these problems are fixed you all have a chance to get your BTC cheap.

There are plenty of incentives to implement such things. It's safe to assume that nobody has a shortcut yet. 
The design of proof of work algorithms is precisely the task of remaining out of reach of shortcuts. 
It's an arms race, not set and forget.

You could expect to gain from investing in the transaction pipeline which feeds Bitcoin's fundamental value.
You would also be in the best position to optimize your bitcoin acquisition workflow to reduce fees. Your options here are growing.
It's all investment but on longer timeframes.

I disagree. The security of this blockchain implementation is supported by proof of work sufficiently expensive to replicate that high transaction values are safe. The block reward connects the price of mining to the value of mining. 
Obviously there is a lot of speculation and adoption effects on top of that.
I can't believe in much security value on a blockchain unless there is a corresponding proof of work system and mining economy tied to it. The scale of that economy is intimately tied to the value of the currency used to denominate it.

How did you get to that conclusion?
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:12:38
Hardware wallets are not general-purpose computers. You cannot install custom software on them, therefore, malware cannot be installed on them. 
Obviously that's the theory and I think all systems can be broken in principle, but without an open method to install arbitrary code, the barrier to exploit is waaay higher.

Hierarchies have a maximally efficient operating range. Consider a surgical team. If it's small and the head surgeon is like a dictator, it is a remarkably effective way of magnifying the concentrated expertise of the leader.
I think it's fair to say democracy is less efficient than dictatorship, but the benefits are that it is less susceptible to corruption and the tradeoff is considered worth it.

Bitcoin address collision is 2^160 because the public address is not only sha256 hashed, but then ripemd hashed at 160 bits.

The wall implies that only incremental improvements in performance will come, as opposed to transformative leaps in hash rate achieved by successive hardware mining paradigms: CPU and GPU.

Well.. in the short term it costs them nothing. 
In the medium term I think their success depends on how well they adapt to the massive technological efficiency boost that is about to happen around them. 
They should ask newspapers, retail stores, record labels and movie studios how well being wrong about the internet worked for them.

Unfortunately this doesn't help me much at all. I can see how talent pickers gain. They spot future popularity and profit on coin price growth. 
Following your example, nobody will see the deathmetal coin growth except people who already filter by deathmetal unless deathmetal is the most popular genre.
While you have translated "popularity" into an equity, you still have the curation and discovery problems. You're still solving those problems with a single score and human categorisation.

My concern is that Dorian exhibits moments of uncanny coherence and comprehension at odds with the statement about "bitcoin the company". His position seems to rely on sustained high ignorance of the subject matter that has upturned his life. 
It just invokes alarm bells in my head.
His vocabulary includes some particular words e.g. "divulge", "implied" and I while it's obvious his speech is inconsistent with Real Satoshi's writing, the strong evidence of trolling (e.g. the Russian) makes me doubt his current media persona. 
How deep does the trolling go?
Leah's story also has a few interesting features including quotes from the brother about Dorian's infuriating personality and a prediction of his resolute denial. These descriptors are incredibly consistent with the theory that Dorian is Real Satoshi.
After all, if you want to stay secret just imagine that you are eventually found - what defense can you make then? The most believable one is that you are not hiding therefore you are not the guy with the secret. Not to mention the lack of conspicuous riches.
It's hard to fault this strategy, even if it's high sophistication fails the [Occam's Razor]( test.
Defense in depth indeed.

The signature is not a full solution. Real Satoshi needs to do something to get Dorian off the hook but I can't think what he could possibly do that could not be attributed to Dorian by a biased sceptic.

It seems binary, like it is either total privacy or total surveillance. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 23:55:55
I'm betting it signs the transaction, then encrypts that to send over sms. So the encryption is for privacy but the transaction integrity is maintained by bitcoin's transaction protocol. Decrypting and broadcasting transactions is a cheap service to provide.

Good recap.
Is it really known that there is no real individual person, Satoshi? If he exists perhaps his absence from current Bitcoin discussion means he doesn't want to be found (or he is dead/coma etc).
Or is this considered totally implausible and much more likely he Satoshi was an alias?
