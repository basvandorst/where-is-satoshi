That's only for FDIC insured accounts. Safety deposit deposit boxes are not included and FDIC insurance does not protect the loss of value of cash assets to inflation (some would consider inflation to be theft by a different means).


All institutions are required to follow property abandonment law. For-profit or non-profit makes no difference. Also, property in safety deposit boxes are still susceptible to civil asset forfeiture. Police need not convict you of a crime to seize your property, they only need a court order and the property is immediately seized. Even if they wrongfully accuse you of something, they can still keep your property. Property does not have rights like people do. You're property is guilty until proven innocent. 


I'm not sure what size of city you live in but the credit unions in my town will probably see hundreds or even thousands of customers in a given day. The tellers won't know your name unless you go out of your way to chat with them. Also, let's hope they do call you. If not, you're screwed.
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:42:53
Great idea considering those currencies generally have higher than normal inflation rates. I don't blame them for wanting to protect their wealth.
How can we help these guys out? I think 3rd world adoption of bitcoin is critical to the long-term success of bitcoin and it should be easier to get them on board considering their currency is extremely weak.

Well, hopefully you store nothing of value in it.

What he is saying is he can't be charged of the specific crime of money laundering. If bitcoin is not money then it can't be money laundering. It has to be called something else.
@_date: 2014-04-15 07:39:01
We need not ask them. The companies will come flocking to bitcoin if enough people are using it. They're greedy like all the rest.
@_date: 2014-04-15 07:32:21
Completely agree. 
Last year I was selling my college books so I offered them for sale on my college campus's facebook textbook group. People could either buy with fiat and pay full price or they could pay with bitcoin and get 20% discount. Sure got a discussion going about what bitcoin was etc. Also, yes I did end up selling them to another student for bitcoin!
Also kind of strange, many of my accounting/finance teachers have heard about bitcoin. Unfortunately most are skeptical of it. I personally don't bother to argue with them. Most academics are resistant to new ideas, even when the new idea is proven successful in the market place.

and the buy signal? when everyone starts complaining about low prices?
Honestly though, it would be a pretty interesting to do some research on this. Maybe, pull keywords from reddit posts and then compare those to the price movements. The data might actually be useful for short-term trades.
@_date: 2014-04-03 06:43:00
What I do is sell stuff and offer 10% discount if paid in bitcoin. You'll get a bunch of idiots trying to buy the item from you at the discount price but wanting to pay with cash. I tell them no because of the risk of getting robbed with cash, lol!
Also works great if you buy/sell on facebook. I was offering 20% discount if paid in bitcoin when I was selling my college textbooks!
and yup, I did actually find people to buy the books with bitcoin. Worked great!
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:34:47


The point I'm trying to make is that the decision is no longer up to the courts. The power gets transferred to the individual. The debts will only be paid IF the borrower agrees to pay it. Under the current system, the lender can go to the courts to attempt to get repayment (asset seizure, garnishment etc). Sure, they could still threaten imprisonment but when you realize that it costs 50k per annum to incarcerate someone then you will soon realize that they can't put everyone in jail. 


Thanks to bitcoin all of those are now choices you CAN make that you did not have. The ethics of it is a different argument. Sure, people should pay debts which they voluntarily entered into but what about when someone feels their rights and property are being unjustly violated. Bitcoin allows them to make the CHOICE to resist such injustices.
@_date: 2014-04-12 05:07:50


Of course, bitcoin doesn't stop everything. The key word you used was legitimate. Obviously, if you have some sort of lean/garnishment by IRS then you should pay it. Of course, that's assuming said individual is ethical. As we all know, some people will be ethical and others won't. 
If you are working for a legitimate business then they will happily comply with all IRS/government garnishments.


In terms of bitcoin, if the IRS has your private key then you don't actually own those bitcoins. Hence the reason securing your private keys to your bitcoins as being a top priority. Also I would strongly advise against paying in excess withholding to the IRS for obvious reasons.
@_date: 2014-04-02 00:05:17
What I don't get is if bitcoin is a stupid pointless scam as the anti-bitcoin people say, then why do they fell so threatened by it?
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:15:30
I'm sure there is a law somewhere in the books about it. They don't call it CRIMINAL law for nothing.
@_date: 2014-03-31 05:36:13
My point exactly. You have to jump through so many hoops to actually renounce it that is is practically impossible.  The only people who actually do it are the very dedicated. You make it sound like you just walk into some embassy, sign some papers and you are done. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 18:52:55


That sounds logical but in reality, the idea will need to be tested in a real world setting. The idea might not be a practical for traditional kickstarter type ideas but it might be useful for other unconventional ideas.
What I figure is that the projects will be smaller in value and reputation will be critical. 
There is not much to lose by developing the idea so it ends up being a net win for society, even if the project ends up being a flop. You never know, the idea could spawn a new wave of independent entrepreneurs.
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:55:22
There are other ways to dispute the transaction even with transaction. Remember, ebay knows that the buyer is 1,000% more important than the seller.
@_date: 2014-05-17 19:02:54


Yup and that is up to the bitcoin community to prevent by educating people on why centralized institutions should not be trusted. Satoshi merely built the technology, it is up to us to determine how to use it. I also might add that the same dilemma occurs with every technology. Do we use nuclear technologies to generate massive amounts of electricity or do we use it to build weapons of mass destruction etc.

@_date: 2014-04-15 07:26:57
Could also be about getting people in the store to begin with. If you have a $25 gift card, some people are going to go into the store and buy $50 worth of stuff. For companies to maximize their profits they must think at the margins which starts by getting people in the store in the first place. I know the places like CVS and Walgreens give away low-value items for free using coupons and rewards cards. Why? Because they know people are going to impluse buy and that's where they will make their money. They still get out ahead even with lots of people going into the store just for the freebie items.
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:01:29
Kinda figured. So, let's say I buy the card, wait the 5 days and it comes in the mail. Then I immediately go to to walmart to use it. Do you think the cards will be denied at checkout?
He does offer escrow so worse case scenario i dispute the transaction.
EDIT: I checked feedback, he has mixed reviews. Some saying it didn't work and they got refund and other people saying it worked. Overall, looks like scammer though.

I agree and believe it or not, the IRS coming out and stating how bitcoin should be taxed is actually a good thing. Why? because for businesses and large investors it adds certainty. Now they know that they can invest large sums of money into bitcoin and as long as they pay according to the IRS guidelines they will be good. Prior to the announcement, no one really knew how to treat bitcoin in terms of taxes. Uncertainty translate into risk for businesses and large investors. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 22:45:51
exahash sounds like a lot. Is there any way you can help to picture how fast that is? It is kinda like saying that the universe  is 11,000,000,000,000 light years across. Hard to wrap your mind around it.
@_date: 2014-05-12 03:43:40


Still, it proves absolutely nothing to show that he will be unbiased regarding economics. It just proves he knows a lot about economics. 


It was biased towards Keynesian theories and failed to even mention the other schools of economic thought. The book is presented as a text on macroeconomics but it ends up being just one sided. An unbiased book would talk about the various schools of thought and would allow the student to use critical thinking to weigh which theory is best. The text presents everything as absolute truth. 
If you read a wikipedia article on whatever economic topic and compare it to the same topic in the textbook you can really see how much the book is biased. Wikipedia will explain a certain economic concept by giving each school's explanation of it. [for example, read this article about the great depression]( You can clearly see the article explaining the causes of the great depression based on various schools. The textbook I listed will only explain it based on Keynesian theory. Blatantly biased.
@_date: 2014-04-04 05:50:58
Where do I find the AML codes?
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:22:15
Yes exactly. At the end of the day, honest sellers will be rewarded (with good reputation) and scammers/bad business people will be punished with bad reputation. The net effect is huge incentives to play fairly.

Fiat is just a technology that is used in our modern age. All technologies will eventually be replaced by superior technology. The idea that fiat will never be replaced is laughable because the history of money will show you that the form  money has always been disrupted by some superior technology.


It could happen, you just need the right government that is opposed to the west. Using a cryptocurrency would be a major slap in the face to western fiat currencies.


It's called foreign exchange. Bitcoins can always be sold on the open market to get whatever form of money you need.


Oh really? Just because corporations aren't using it now doesn't mean they won't ever use it in the future.


and that means bitcoin won't EVER be stable in the future?
@_date: 2014-05-12 06:21:53

I'm an accounting major so this type of stuff is a huge can of worms to say the least in terms of an audit. First off, they have to be able to identify that you, 'own' the coins. Then a basis needs to established (how much did you pay for the coins in the first place?) and how much you sold the coins for. 
My guess is that for a few years, the whole tax thing is going to be purely on good faith. If you don't pay, you probably won't get audited and if you do get audited, it won't be over your bitcoin transactions. Of course, if you are buying/selling lots of bitcoins and using the traditional banking system then then that might raise red flags.
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:07:45
selling what?

No, it is important because the fact of the matter is that bitcoin has and always will be associated with the ability to protect your wealth from confiscation. Bitcoin is a technology that is going to change people's behaviors and that's an important topic to be discussed. 


Some amount? It could easily be used to hide ALL wealth.
Going forward, I wouldn't be surprised to see more people hiding their wealth in bitcoin. It will be increasingly utilized by drug dealers, cartels, individuals who live on the fringes of society and others who don't want their wealth confiscated by traditional financial system confiscation methods.

Yup and the bigger irony is that the NSA is supposedly operating in the USA's best interest. By the NSA not notifying the proper developers to fix the bug they were putting millions of americans at risk and they were putting the USA financial system at risk of full collapse. Exploiting the bug for intelligence instead of reporting it to be fixed clearly shows that the NSA is a national security THREAT. 
Just imagine if hackers used this exploit to steal massive databases of information containing SSN, names, DOB, banking information etc and then used all this information all at once in a massive attack. 
[here is an article where organized hackers stole 45 million from ATMs in a few hours](
Now think of that attack but if they had all credit card numbers and other personal information. They might be able to steal so much that the banks would have to shut down the traditional payment processing networks to prevent further damage. Something to think about.
@_date: 2014-05-12 06:13:27
Yeah, I wonder how it works over there. I wonder what happens if someone is passing fake US notes. US would have such a hard time tracking the source of it and who knows if the secret service would even do anything. 
I would just laugh my ass off if USD in Zimbabwe fell into hyperinflation because someone figured out how to mass print fake USD. I've heard that certain fake USD notes are so good that only a professional can distinguish them.

Absolutely. For anyone who had had medical bills, loads of credit card debt, lawsuits, and other people coming after their assets then they will know the value of bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-04-12 08:09:17


Bingo. I know hackers these days are getting more sophisticated. They know to maximize the return on their assets (stolen information) they need to do some sort of coordinated effort to exploit the information as fast as possible. Some unknown group might be plotting such an event as we speak.

and I think this is another very important [graph to look at]( Gold is sold as a, "rare" metal but in reality, we get better and better every decade at finding it.

As far as I know, there are no currencies/commodity monies where the production is following geometric decay.

It puts the power back in the individual's hands. Compared to the traditional system, that's a HUGE shift in power. It goes from the government having absolute control to a complete reversal where the individual now has absolute control. 
Just imagine the individual who has millions in bitcoins and has millions in debts that need to be repaid by court order. That person's lenders are shit out of luck to say the least.

No the problem is believing the idea that the national currency should be used for some sort of economic planning tool. The currency should be used to facilitate trade, that's it. The fed's policy should be to maintain inflation at +/- 1% of 0% inflation.
The reason it is a problem is that the fed can also create problems if they are not setting interest rates at the real (unknown) market rate. If they don't set it at the real market rate then we end up getting booms and busts as people respond to interest rates. It only works good when the fed is able to accurately predict what the interest rate should be. Based on the history of the fed, they have a very poor track record of doing so. They often keep the interest rate for low for far too long.
@_date: 2014-04-16 04:31:42

Another way to look at it is by thinking about what bitcoin is replacing: traditional money. Just think of the resources that go into operating banks, printing money, producing coins (mining, extraction, refining of the metals).
