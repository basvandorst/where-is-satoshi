You can't exchange 0.001 of an iphone for goods or services, though.

I bought $600 btc at 
$12,030 today! All I could with my coinbase limits. Worst thing that can happen is I lose 100% of what I can afford to. Not playing with rent money here :)
Good luck to you

I'm with ya! My girlfriend is talking about putting some money in, too :)

I do that when I can, but they cap me at $750/week. They also charge a pretty big fee for doing so whereas a bank transfer to USD wallet --&gt; crypto is WAY cheaper. Free for LTC and $12 for $5000 BTC whereas it's closer to $40 for $1000 BTC via coinbase.

You can only deposit $x/week into coinbase. I've hit my limit on deposits and purchases, so I can't :)

I put $15k between LTC, ETH, BTC and XRP over the last week. I'm down $3-4k in the last 24 hours.
Do I care? Nope. Did I know what I was getting into? Yep. Am I worried? Nope. Do I wish I bought in today vs last week? Sure, of course. But that's not really possible. As a newbie, it's been a real pain in the ass to convert USD to anything. I've never had to work harder to throw money at something before between the exchanges not accepting new people to verification, 6-10 day long bank transfers, weekly coinbase caps, etc.
Point is there's a huge future for all of this stuff, IMO. It's fun to stare at the ticker and ride the emotional roller coaster of your portfolio fluctuating more on a daily basis than a U.S stock portfolio does in a year, but this isn't a 24/7 upward trend. I bought at a shitty time if you're looking at 2 weeks as your timeline.
I'm betting in 5 years I'll look back and laugh at how silly being down $3,000 in a night made me feel.
Pointless post, but just wanted to throw my opinion out there.
Good luck all.

My opinion should mean absolutely nothing when it comes to your money. I have no qualifications you should care about; I'm playing with my own money, not investing for you.

I'll send ya a beer if I'm rich; you send me one if I'm poor. Deal?

It's a place called Surf Brother's Teriyaki in Encinitas, CA. I thought it was pretty neat to see it; I just poked the machine and it brought up a camera asking me to scan my QR code.
I can only imagine they accept BitCoin if they have the machine there.

pants remain unsoiled. Not super stoked, but I have all of my coins locked up in my ledger wallet that's not getting touched for a few years as originally planned. I also ended up putting considerably more cash in over the last month and a half; added DENT, ADA, cV, DBC, PRL, TEL, and a few ICOs. Feeling the pain across every coin this last week :)
I bought some mining hardware and have been getting into that for the time being, it's a fun little hobby and gives me some coin to play around with that doesn't involve putting any more USD in. I am 100% hard capped on how much $ I will spend on this stuff now.

I have an equal amount of cash in the financial sector. Not the best week I've had but I'm not stocking up on Ramen yet
