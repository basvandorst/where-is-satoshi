I think ours is one of two businesses in all of Seattle that is listed with Yelp accepting bitcoin. I was on the phone with my assigned Yelp account manager 2 months ago asking for an attributes button. He said he talked to the developers and they couldn't do it. Then, mysteriously it is available. This is great!

"too simplistic" is not an argument for or against an idea.
Fractional reserve banking is possible with Bitcoin, only the losses for failure cannot be socialized by the state.
I think that discovering a "why" to care about something is much more important than learning "what" to think.

"I don't know if it's Stockholm Syndrome or what, but everybody I talk to out here is saying that Bitcoin is the next big thing.." Um...never heard that take before. I'm into it because reason and evidence support it's mass adoption not because I'm hoping to not be killed by it.

Inflation *is* money creation. Sometimes an increase in prices results from that process but not always. 
Money creation by a central planning authority is wholly different than mining gold, bitcoin, lending capital or investing time. The latter examples are the result of land, labor &amp; capital investment (wealth production) or constraint and delay of consumption (saving/lending).  
If the costs of debasing the currency are never realized by those who wish to spend it, then the self-regulating counterforce of self-interest is subverted.

I don't know. But it seems there are plenty of historical examples of banks issuing currency based on reserves. I can't think of any reason why banks couldn't issue their own currency (could be crypto too of course) based on a Bitcoin reserve and at any time redeemable in Bitcoin. Pretty easy to audit and to lend out at interest. The interest rate would reflect the price discovery between those who were willing to delay consumption in exchange for the premium people would be willing to pay for access to capital. Simple right?
