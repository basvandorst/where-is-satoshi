decent price hopefully we don't go too much further down I personally am in the red holding. I highly recommend keeping some money on hand in case if it drops alot more then you can buy cheap coins but make sure you do not overspend. the 666 price is good hold it obviously. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 00:28:48
That is fucked dude.  Do you have any proof of purchases etc anything beyond his word that they are your coins? Just store them on coinbase if it isn't too many and in the meantime spend your free time researching for yourself what to do.
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:47:08
I will probably get downvoted but I have had much worse shit happen to me and I didn't get 20 thousand dollars? Am I missing something what happened to him he got media attention for a couple days like celebrities get 24/7? Did he get injured or something? But on another note if people donated this money they felt he deserved it, so it should be his.
Still though wtf 20k.

That made me laugh. If we do have a welcoming committee it should be a sit down with Chris Hansen. I am not saying bitcoiner's are into cp or anything just a nice sitdown asking for what reason are you here? to troll, buy coins to use on dp web sites etc. pump and dumper?

Point out how much the fee's are as well you have to pay 1% to buy and 1% to sell it add's up if you plan on day trading and making multiple transactions a day. I am looking at all my past fee's kinda hurts but i'm so in the clear so I am happy.
edit: you should encourage him to do chores or small jobs for usd so he can buy more btc better than day trading. Especially if he is feeling bullish.
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:50:06
This is what is so hard to explain (well actually easy to explain but they do not believe) to most people they just do not seem to be able to comprehend that it goes from usd to btc to usd in a matter of minutes.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:00:43
Jeez I wish I could post something where I can get a bunch of free bitcoins.(  (Broke adult over here).
@_date: 2013-09-30 17:45:53
Not allowed to ask questions here? I stated I just purchased my first bitcoin a few days ago.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:35:42
Bitcoin will be amazing for you and your customers. It is so freaking simple comparatively.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:27:56
He should just sell with a 6% fee attached since he only has so many limit the amount one can buy so you have time to rebuy at lows plus keep them wanting more.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:28:29
Yeah I realized that when I just signed up, thanks.

How are you going to use one of my favorite shows, to make fun of one of my favorite coins? 
Please watch more Upright it is the best.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:07:27
Pretty sure it is how Coinbase and Bitpay automatically convert it into usd for you I am sure you can just log in and set how much you want to keep as usd versus btc. The transfer of money would just be in btc then bitpay or coinbase will do the converting for you and for better rates than banks do for converting currencies and transactions. That being said the employer can pay via Bitcoin but the worker can intermediately cash it into usd at that set rate or just keep the btc I am guessing most would choose a mixture of usd and btc.
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:46:55
So what is going on with Gox they are trading at the same price as Bitstamp. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:29:57
Buy some amazon gift cards on gyft.com with bitcoins and buy a new computer on amazon.
Also you will have to pay capital gains tax if you turn it back into usd so that is why you should buy the computer with the btc directly.
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:24:38
If I drive by any subway from now on I will stop in and ask if they accept Bitcoin, if not I will say you should and walk out like a freaking G.

I love amazon and amazon loves me. I also love bitcoin very interesting proposal.
Edit: So I am using my amazon account with my amazon credit card to purchase the item, then you pay me in Bitcoin? So there is the Benefit of credit card points and being able to buy bitcoins with a credit card. I definitely will be downloading this app. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:34:15
Coinbase is perfect takes a week for the first month but you can get instant after the month if you link a credit card. I live in the USA so good for USA USD

He could just replenish his btc whenever he deposits on your site but then he would have to have the money to do so.

This site is nice as an addition to a few others.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:00:08
Seriously gox went up maybe 30 usd after hearing but lets not talk about the 200 usd in the last 2 days right? Because all this increase is because of the US hearing right because The US controls the whole fucking world right?

silkroad was also used as a coin tumbler I have heard from other posts. People would just send the coins to silkroad (silkroad tumbled all coins I think once deposited) then to a new address.

When you buy one you might want to convert it to LTC or some alt coin so you can have more shares possibly more return. ltc is 23$ a share or coin right now.
