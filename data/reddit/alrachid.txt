Those pesky fees, I tell ya.

I want to see bitcoin have a $10k floor and a new ceiling!

The money goes to a bitcoin withdrawal address when I want it too. You can make a coinbase account then send bitcoin to these websites.  No I don't believe they will just scam me because there have been many videos of people withdrawing. Of course these are risky and you never know what will happen.

Lol, my couch pulls out, but bitcoiners dont.

I love dip.

Lol... You are hilarious. You come in here with this bad attitude trying to trash talk one of my income streams by pointing out obvious things that have helped me gain but are not the limit of my gains. I can hardly even believe that you are being serious because you seem like a troll. You say I have my head up my ass, but again in your most recent comment you basically insist that ICO's are free money, just like you trying to say that I did nothing to earn my money. I think it is you my friend that has your head so far up your ass that you are looking out your mouth.

All of these are extremely high risk. Anytime you hand bitcoin to someone else you never really know if you will get it back. With that being considered, this has been out for 4+ months and is paying very well which is why I was comfortable depositing money. It is by no means a safe investment. Rather, its a risky, exciting investment and I thought I would share. I recently started investing in ICOs also. Follow if you enjoy! Thanks!

My progress with various lending platforms like Bitconnect, Chain Group, Regal Coin as well as the current progress with the ICO's that I am invested in or trying to become invested in. This is a documentation of my own journey for the purpose of education for others. Thank you for watching!

I do not really yet, I just started making videos of my cryptocurrency journey. I also invest in risky programs, ICOs, and trading, or "gambling" as some folks call it.  
Poloniex has plenty of problems though, but overall I have made a good amount there.

Lol. Ok. I know I am an amateur. And if I can make money I guess the whole world can make money. I understand nothing according to your analysis. And understanding nothing has brought me 2 free bitcoins. $20k for FREE! POVERTY IS SOLVED because money is free now and takes no knowledge and understanding, right? Did you know there is more than 1 way to trade? And thousands of different "trading strategies?" I am sure you knew that since you are a mfin' professional. Tell me how my 5x from ICO's in 30 days is doing something wrong also. Tell me how I am going to lose money when all the HODLers hold through the correct and I dont. You can kindly suck my big toe. You seem to know my life and my knowledge based on a couple minutes of video from my 3rd week of making videos. Have a good day. Im going to continue gambling on up trends because POVERTY IS SOLVED! MONEY IS FREE!

Xbot would have been a great one to be in since day 1. That's for sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:21:37
I turned .005 into 2 full bitcoins at one point. Anything is possible! Be determined and do your research!

Altcoins as their satoshis each rise and fall.

Ok, you can call it what you want. I gambled back and forth and turned $100 to $10,000. I don't care if it's called cat jumping, because of it I don't have to work for other people. I open a trade, I close a trade, and I profit or lose.... um as far as I know that is what traders do.  
If I were to HODL my original investment I would have about $500 instead of the $10,000+ that I have because of my "gambling." I sit and "gamble" all day while other people are "working."

I think you have to do what Facebook, Google, Apple, etc... do. Offshore accounts or something like that? If they can do it, we can too?!? Equality for all!

Yes, I have had many bad experiences there but more good than bad. The thing is, no one goes to write a review when they are happy, they wait until something goes wrong and then they do a review. I have lost money because of some of their glitches but I still keep a few k there for good opportunity days.

How the hell can a bar go bankrupt? I am in Wisconsin and we have bars on every corner and they make so much money. Even the bars out in the country survive. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:22:15
I never thought about it like that but yup, thats exactly how it went. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:14:11
Its hard to say, I don't like to make suggestions because my choices have to do with personal research. I hope that my video can be a starting point but I suggest you do extra reading and only invest where you are comfortable and understand the risk. Hope you have success!

The government wants to garnish at least 20% of whatever you make on whatever you do. They might be a little upset if they can't "tax" bitcoin and enough people are using it.
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:30:11
It will recover, but not tonight.... you see, it takes the people a while to catch on. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:28:46
We are seeing what was meant to happen..... the BTC Cash money is flowing into the market cap of BTC... by design, naturally. Muahahahaha

Thank you for this post! It's sad that people will stoop as low as paid Google ads to steal. There must be so much work to be done to cover your tracks. Theft is theft and its illegal even if the product is unregulated! Everyone report the phishing ad!
