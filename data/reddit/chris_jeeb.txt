Same. Coinbase and Coinsquare were almost instantly confirmed. Coinmama took about 4 hours today. I was tweaking so hard... but I had patience. Now I will be sure to send a decent mining fee instead of shitting my pantaloons for hours

Yep �� I’ve been using it on iOS for over a year now. No issues.

BRD for me. Open source and connected directly to the blockchain. Can also delete the app and keep your 12 word seed safe and make it a cold wallet too.

Surprised the two posters before you that were edging their little nubs hoping to be the first to post about this “dump” didn’t post this gif. Looks like you’ve done it mate

No doubt BRD is safer than Coinbase. You do not own your bitcoin if they are still on an exchange (see Quadriga). 
The bigger question, and I’ve tried posting this in the BRD subreddit, is BRD really equally as good as the hardware? Personally, I love BRD. Easy to use and access. If I have all the security on my iPhone (passcode on iPhone, passcode and fingerprint in BRD) I have to imagine this is as safe as a hardware, where I’d be worried if I lost it, or if it got damaged or if I lose the 24 word seed. I’ve also toyed with the fact that you can delete the BRD app, while keeping your seed secure somewhere and it acts essentially as cold storage. 
Can someone explain the security difference between BRD and a hardware wallet?

I do not have all the technical jargon, but in normal speak, they operate off of a protocol that you can use with another wallet that uses that same protocol. It’s is also completely decentralized and connected directly to blockchain, so you are really in control of your bitcoin/keys. But if they do go out of business, just find another wallet that would be compatible, and use your 12 word seed there to recover wallet

Whenever there’s a “crash” or “bull run” it’s like the Asperger Olympics in here to see who can post the quickest. Points on creativity, you could have just posted a graph or the rollercoaster in reverse.

Your story is awesome, but how many times are you going to post it? Third time I've seen it. Kind of ruins the story when it keeps getting posted for publicity.
