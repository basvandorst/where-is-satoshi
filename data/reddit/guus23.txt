They stated that for 2018 40B of XRP will be locked in in escrow, when that happen they cannot dump it. Thus, this wil happen this month. What are your thoughts about that?

you are seriously the first one who get me doubt my investments in XRP
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:21:19
Too much effort, can you tell what happen instead?:)

haha it is indeed a coin designed for banks. It provides a solution to inefficient cross-bank transfers. Bitcoin is a different project indeed

Authenticator should be enough right?

Interesting post. So youre stating that you shouldnot add new long position on the market right now? I just add a new long position on bitcoin, you think that is not a good idea?

How much % of your salary goes to crypto monthly? Iam curious
@_date: 2018-10-30 08:19:35
50% on nano, 50% on exchange

The more people say this, the less chance it will happen
@_date: 2018-10-28 18:03:20

Very bad comparison. In the future banks do not have cash also so whats the point?
@_date: 2019-01-21 08:07:46
With that said, it makes me wonder what "new" people will buy bitcoin if there will be a next bull run. Last December I remember that friends and people I know, who normally never invest in anything other than beers, start to invest in crypto.
My question/point is, are there any more new people left to enter this market if there is a next bullrun?

now i feel stupid i read your whole comment
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:41:11
Youre still dreaming

People are dumping tether
@_date: 2019-01-30 12:38:11
No not in the light of the other comparisons that are very accurate. 
This is just a very dumb comparison
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:03:04
Hahahahah
