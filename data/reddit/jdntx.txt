I've been waiting for a month for ID verification on Gemini.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:43:54
Congrats on the find, and welcome to the community!
It's a bit of a drawn out process, depending on where you live.
If you're in the USA, you're going to need to find a currency exchange (I use [Gemini Exchange]( fwiw). You'll sign up, send over some identity verification documents, wait, and wait.
You'll have to wait, for real. Verification takes a long time at many exchanges these days due to the high volume of new users and the legal requirements for verification in USA.
Once you're verified, you ought to be able to link up your bank information. Whichever exchange you choose should have instructions for this. From there, once the account is linked up. you'll be able to freely trade between your bank and your exchange of choice. Sell your BTCs and enjoy that sweet victory.
That being said, here is my REAL advice to you, new blood: HODL on to your bitcoins. You didn't need them up until now, and their value inflated orders of magnitude more than if you had kept it anywhere else.
Keep your cryptocurrency in a secure wallet, and ride this baby out with the rest of us.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:11:04
That's just kinda how USA financial laws work. You'd get the same treatment at any of the online investment firms such as Vanguard of Charles Schwab. 
You don't HAVE to exchange it into USD now, or ever.
Get a secure wallet and keep it safe until you can't resist cashing it out.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bitcoin. The value is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the profits will go over a typical user’s head. There’s also Satoshi's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate revolutionary nature of this currency, to realise that it's not just valuable- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Bitcoin truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the value in Bitcoin's existential catchphrase “To the moon!”, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Satoshi Nakamoto’s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer monitors. What fools.. how I pity them. ��
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Bitcoin tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ��

That's the kind of personal responsibility I would only subject someone to if they were put here to live by choice. 
Since none of us asked to be born into this world, I don't hold people to that level of responsibility. Furthermore, I suspect it would be more economical to allow someone to pursue their passion than it would be to deal with the costs of fitting a round peg into a square hole.
My example was silly, but maybe I could pick a better one: Making a living as a talented musician is intensely difficult. I don't think someone should be punished if their only talent, and their only source of joy was making music. (something that's ultimately "useless" in an objective sense.)

How much control do you think BFL Josh actually has over what the company does with its units? Maybe he's lying, or maybe he's just been given false info. 
Evidence of lying would have to involve evidence that he is willfully telling untruths, otherwise he might just be sorely mistaken, and taking other people at the company at their word (probably a mistake too).
Is BFL shady? Sure, but that's not enough to be proof of anything other than their PR department being a total disaster.

I didn't mean to imply that it's trivial to crack encryption. Personally, I'd have held onto that hard disk until I found a way to get those BTCs into my own wallet.
I'd even be willing to bet that the password is stored in plain text somewhere on the very same hard drive.

As the difficulty increases, BTC will become more rare, and the price will increase according to the whims of the free market.

What I'm assuming is that the original user (dumb enough to forget about the BTC on the drive) probably uses the same password they use to sign into most every website they log onto.
It's probably WAY less than 15 characters long, and I would be willing to bet it uses only alphanumerics, and not choosing from a full set of unicode characters.
A-Z and 0-9
If your password is shorter than 10 characters, brute force is certainly an option.

There is no anonymity on the internet. Any illusions of it are just that; illusions.
There's ALWAYS someone out there who can find you, find out who you are, can find out what you're doing with your computer.
You cannot create a system designed to disseminate information and expect it to do anything other than that.

Actually I misread something.
When restoring your Trezor One wallet, the seed phrase must be typed in on a computer (risk of keylogging, etc)
The Trezor T skirts this by including the ability to enter your seed via a touch screen on the device itself.

There is no individual opinion on Bitcoin that actually matters. Nobody knows what the price will be, but it might be safe to assume it won't stay at the current level forever.
@_date: 2013-08-24 19:06:06
Really, because I find it more moronic for you to assume that any of us give a shit about your lack of purchase.

did they really promise? or are you taking their (poor, lazy, insert adjective of choice) estimates and turning them into promises in your mind?
I understand that they've been performing poorly,  but to say they promised you something, implies that a company is even capable of making a "promise".
They can pledge, endeavor, etc. But never promise.

Ordered my Jala in february, it arrived over a week ago, and it's well on its way to paying for itself. 
Never mind the likelihood that the BTC will go up in value between now and then as the mining difficulty rises.
@_date: 2013-09-17 22:34:12
You have an awkward definition of "better" if it doesn't include the ability to purchase said asics. 
@_date: 2013-09-03 18:41:32
I mine because I believe in BTC. (edit: and I want to help it succeed)
At current difficulty, my miner would have paid for itself in about a month (I just hooked it up the other day).
Granted, the difficulty will increase before I hit that mark, but also potentially so would the value of the Bitcoin.
Or later on. Many of us believe that BTC could be worth a _lot_ more in the future.
@_date: 2013-07-16 22:30:34

I am connected to BFL. I ordered a Jalapeno and I'm still waiting on it.
Unlike you guys, I don't feel the urge to constantly bitch, because I _knew what I was getting into_.
@_date: 2013-09-10 23:30:49
Simple: Mt.Gox still has almost 2x the volume of trade as the next competitor, BitStamp.

Are you seriously so paranoid that you can't handle some guy on the internet calling you out on it?
I don't work for BFL you fucking moron.
@_date: 2013-07-01 21:16:18
It's no "problem" for bitcoin.
The only people who have problems with the wild price fluctuations are the speculative traders, and maybe vendors who accept BTC.
@_date: 2013-10-20 19:53:51
You are definitely being foolish. 
They're still the highest volume trader of anything out there.
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:57:45
People are hating on BFL and have the nerve to do it on their own forum. And they're somehow surprised at the ban? A lot of these folks will blame anything but their own piss poor attitude.

Anyways, this post is _really_ about people who continue to mine despite difficulty increases and decreases in profitability.
I'd like to try and figure out what reasons, other than monetary ones, there are for people to spend their resources supporting the bitcoin infrastructure.

But Bitcoin doesn't depend on investors, new users or much of anything else. Bitcoin depends on the P2P software.

A lot of the reason people are likely using MT.Gox is precisely the account verification. 
If you've got a lot of real world money tied up in the BTC system, it might be wise at this point to go ahead and let the government know about it.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:50:49
That's privileged information, sorry.
I ordered the miner in February, if that gives you any concept of the value of BTC between then and now.

Short of having a BFL employee sworn in and taken to court, you're not going to get any sort of "honest" communication from them.
To assume any of their estimates are accurate at this point, is completely foolish.
@_date: 2013-06-30 18:06:00
Isn't it just slightly possible, that someone at Mt Gox got their account hijacked?
They could be using a legit account to try and phish users.
@_date: 2013-09-11 00:35:41
Nowhere did anyone at BFL say "I promise you..."
about anything. Now, if you ask me if they're failing to meet our (and likely their own) expectations, then yeah they've definitely failed. and their communication on the matter is not helping matters either.
Even with all of the problems they've had, I would still rank BFL over most of the competition.
@_date: 2013-07-15 18:25:13
Obviously you have never looked at the sheer volume of trade that happens on the site?
@_date: 2013-09-18 00:43:27
Really, because to everybody else you probably seem pretty paranoid. 
@_date: 2013-09-10 23:38:01
according to... what site?
That one shows Gox clearly ahead, though bitstamp has not updated in a day or so (probably an API bug)
@_date: 2013-07-09 18:31:45
You could always design and build your own ASIC unit.
@_date: 2013-09-18 00:47:36
Now, I would be among the first to admit that BFL handled this whole thing poorly. However, it's important to remember that ineptitude does not equal scam.

True enough, if you're only selling the vape stuff and not the *ahem* more illicit uses of vapes, you'd probably be better off on your own website.
