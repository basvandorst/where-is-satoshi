User wrote about "a rogue transaction", but probably wanted to refer to two transactions (1EZWmoprRtrrSacoBTMKDPuBK6tcByWjzw)
The source of a "rogue transaction" is the same as his withdrawal address (172zFkCUwMY6AxmgK84fWH2TyL4ifLjhSH)
He has a total betting profit on our website, not a loss.
There is no way to know "1EZWmoprRtrrSacoBTMKDPuBK6tcByWjzw" belongs to 999dice yet. Both outputs at the time of this writing are still unspent and in a hot wallet. The only way to know is if you own the account.
Two support messages were received from the user:

Hi. Today this transaction appeared in my bitcoin wallet that I do not recognise: (
I NEVER deposited 0.4 BTC into your site, and I hope you understand my frustration that I was credited, and this amount is not even in my 999dice account.
Could I please request your review of this unauthorised transaction, and I would request that you return  0.4 BTC to 18iTmMLKYq7itTXGeMCKohC3mYFpcpupGq.
I assure you this transaction has nothing to do with me, as I was not even at my computer at this time (and I live alone so it couldn't have been anyone else in my home), and am frustrated that my money has somehow ended up with you even though I specifically stopped gambling recently after a long struggle with a gambling addiction. I don't want anything to do with 999dice, though I appreciate the work that has gone into making this service.
Yours Faithfully, MK

Yo dude, I wrote to you last night about a rogue transaction from my wallet to your site.
I have written up the details here: 
Occasionally, communication patterns like this from a user indicate an attempt to eventually extort coins, but in this case I think the user might just be... confused. Immediately after his first small deposit, he sent this to the chat rooms:
Can anyone explain why there is an unregognised transfer on the blockchain attached to my deposit to this site?
I made a small deposit on this site, why is there a 0.019 transaction too? MODS? 
In any case, the deposits he referred to were just withdrawn again back to his own wallet.
