LOL... On it's way out for years?
You have no idea what is happening in the Javascript world.
NodeJS is more popular than ever.

I tried to write it 'simple' because I have no idea who I'm talking about. I have my own web agency and have a little over 5 year of experience in web development.
I might not know exactly know how Bitcoin works purely line by line but I know enough from the tech to talk about it.
And I also know for a fact that a lot of business and clients what to get into this. And Bitcoin has nothing to offer for them. Except maybe colored coins but you can hang colored coins on practical any other blockchain.
So before you go judge someone I suggest you take a hard look at yourself. I'm mearely trying to help and spread information.

You know what would be far superior. Not needing fiat all together. ;-)

This is why I think Bitcoin will never scale up and reach the masses. Look at it!! Ain’t nobody gonna understand that. By the time you get this userfriendly Bitcoin will already be passed by  Ethereum or Dash or even Bitcoin Cash. We need a company that can make this work. Look at the treasury from Dash. They got some money to throw at it to improve it. We dont have that. We meet more developers, collaborate!!!!!

I agree, I don't understand all these 'Wow my X sat/byte transaction just cleared in Y minutes'.
Dude... Nothing changed, the network just isn't as busy as it was. Thats it. Nothing more. There is still a fucking problem

They work with  for the whole KYC procedure. Works with SEPA deposits/withdraws
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:04:26
KYC procedure is something that can't be 'decentralized'. And it releates to the thread because you asked how the fiat part works.
1 . You walk through the KYC procedur via an external party. Went rather smooth.
2. You link the KYC profile to your EUR token wallet.
3. You can now send/receive fiat to the DEX exchange.

They aren't. They have an official partnership with VISA. So they are the only one not affected. It appears that this is the uppercut that Kris was talking about
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:13:18
In short, this will be the only debit card available. VISA is blocking all other cards issued through WaveCrest.
Monaco is the only one left standing. INSANE!!!!

Lisk is actually a solid block chain project. Allows the creation of your own side-chain for your business development backed up the security from the main chain. Look it up, site is old btw, they are rebranding end of February with a ton of new information.

A lot of reasons:
- It uses a completely different technology. Everything is Javascript based. Almost all web applications use Javascript right now. All the tooling &amp; SDK's are Javascript based so the entry level for developers is super super low.
- PoS
- Bitcoin is meant to be good at one thing and that is value transfer and/or store of value
- Technology of Bitcoin right now is old. But it's working. It's easier to start over when creating a whole new product than to just plug into something that is not meant to be used like that.
- Rootstock is soooo overrated lol

I love DEX from the Waves Platform tbh. It offers the most populair pairs and it has a fiat gateway
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:00:17
It's true. GDAX is owned by Coinbase

More miners don't do anything.

Renting, train, airport, taxi omg I would find a way.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:39:35
I would be freaking leaving instantly. What the fuck
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:26:22
It has improved a lot since their new trading engine.
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:12:05
I would actually say that Ethereum is the Petroleum of our days tbh. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:20:29
Dear god.... are you not over that yet? This thing is huge and offers to disrupt a lot more than the currencies.
@_date: 2018-07-22 15:41:42
You still have to open and close a channel. That's like asking somebody to pay up a full month wage to open up a bank account...
@_date: 2018-07-22 15:35:51
Even using Bitcoin is impossible for these people. The fees will destroy them
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:45:43
At this moment. There were periods of months where the fees would be unpayable for these people
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:38:15
Still have to open a channel thou... Which will cost you the same network fee.
