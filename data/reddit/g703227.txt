Yes, I guess a few lucky people saw it for what it really was, however, I feel the majority will fall into the trap.

Great question, and I have no idea.  If you're suggesting that I said that, read closer.  I said if they end up on might lead them to a bch exchange.

Even though such phones will be a hit if crypto takes off.  I personally would never use such a feature, because chances are high that big manufacturers such as Samsung will make their built in hard\-wallet closed sourced.

Atomic swaps is another one.  A decentralized application of performing atomic swaps uses smart contracts.

What I meant was more local.  For example the US government.  What is stopping them from saying to all US mortgage providers, all real-estate companies, all car (re)sellers, that from today, it is illegal for them to accept bitcoin as payment?
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:16:22
How about banning just in the US, then US using it's military force to force other countries to ban it too?

I agree.  It should be Bitcoin \(BTC\).  Also, the lawsuit should probably include something about r/btc.  r/btc is mainly about bch, yet they seem to be using the Bitcoin \(btc\) ticker to the advantage of bch.  Which is exceptionally misleading.
You can imagine how misleading that is, people search for bitcoin, they might type in btc after realizing that bitcoin's ticker is btc, and they end up at r/btc which misleadingly takes them to a bch exchange, and they end up buying bch without realizing it, when they were after bitcoin \(btc\).
EDIT: If the above is not clear, I will rephrase:  if they end up on which is mostly about bch, might lead them to a bch exchange.  Which would be misleading and deceptive.

Or maybe the Chinese government instead could say "any business found to be accepting bitcoin as payment will be shutdown"?  All I am saying is, the US government has been able ban gold in the past for it's citizens (which still blows my mind), why can't the US government ban bitcoin for US businesses, which will mean that US citizens will not be able to buy normal things such as cars, houses etc with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:04:55


That is basically what I meant, why is the US government not doing that?  If all merchants are forbidden from accepting bitcoin, will that not make bitcoin worthless?  As no one will be able to spend it for anything unless it's P2P, which is still difficult, for example, buying a house P2P style in US still means you have to get registered centrally as the new owner.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:12:26


Exactly, the people who keep saying "they can't ban math", might as well be saying that the government cannot ban gold because the government cannot ban owning metals!  They still banned gold not that long ago.

I whole heartedly disagree.  IMO, bitcoin has value because:
1. It is the first and most secure form of transferring value around the global without having to rely on a 3rd party.  It cannot be stopped by banks and/or governments.  See what is happening in countries like Venezuela.
2. It has value is because unlike fiat, bitcoin increases in value overtime because it cannot be printed the way fiat can be printed at will.  Which explains why fiat such as USD has lost 98% of its value ever since it was created.  
3. My current favourite reason is the fact that unlike fiat which was not designed for the digital world, bitcoin can be used to software bots without having to rely on a 3rd party.
I do agree with some of what you have said, and I can see your perspective as an ex banker with 16 years of experience.  However, what I am seeing is that fiat can only be used by around 4 billion people.  Bitcoin allows software to be added to that 4 billion userbase.  In effect making software almost become entities which can earn money for themselves and/or buy stuff for themselves.  Which makes a 4 billion userbase seem very very small in an IoT financial system.  Fiat will not be able to enter the IoT future financial economy.
So, I feel the people who cannot see that fiat is not designed for the digital world and cryptocurrencies are, are the ones who think bitcoin needs to replace fiat.  It doesn't need to replace fiat (although that would be good).  Bitcoin has made a new financial economy possible which has a larger and faster growing userbase than fiat has.    Bitcoin/crypto-currencies currently have a possible userbase of 24 billion IoT devices.  IoT devices are growing a lot faster than the human population is growing.
Even if bitcoin does not replace fiat for humans, it doesn't really matter because fiat cannot practically enter the impractical and cumbersome in the digital world making it entry into the imminent digital IoT based financial system impractical and unrealistic.

Doesn't look dead to me.
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:06:47
That doesn't really mean anything.
Quick search shows the following:
2013-04-12 to 2013-08-04 had a 98% trading volume drop when the value was about $100, then the price went up.
2013-12-06 to 2014-05-18 had a 99% trading volume drop when the value was around $450, then the price went up.
these 2 examples were very quick searches, I'm sure if I put more time into it, I could find more such trading volume drops followed by big value increases.

What trading volume collapse?  See image below:

Multisig might be useful here.  Or maybe even a time locked smart contract!  I'd definitely do this if time locked smart contracts were used, as in, time lock the given amount of bitcoin for 1 year to be automatically returned.

I should correct myself, bots are possible with fiat but they are very very cumbersome.  It was a nightmare for me to create a bank merchant account, before PayPal would allow me to create a PayPal developer account, just so I could use PayPal's api to get a bot to do fiat transactions before crypto was developed in 2008 (or was it 2009?).  From a software engineers perspective, this is the most exciting aspect of crypto.  Others may disagree or see different aspects which they find exciting, but for me personally, it's all about DAO's, IoT devices, software bot's, and to a lesser extent, the human acceptance of crypto as a replacement for fiat.
It's the main reason why I think crypto does not need to replace fiat (although that would be an added benefit for crypto), because crypto has a huge advantage over fiat when it comes to DAO's, IoT devices, software bot's etc.  Crypto allows these things to become entities which can transact with money by themselves, without having to be associated to a person.  No human association means no human ID is needed, no merchant bank account is needed which can only be open with human ID, no paypal developer account is need which can only be opened by using human ID.  And even after all that, it's still slow and cumbersome and unrealistic for second based micro-payments.
In comes crypto, changes all that, DAO's have now become possible, Bot's no longer need human association to create merchant bank accounts and paypal developer accounts.  This is so much better now for so many reasons.
Another reason why fiat is cumbersome for such tasks is because fiat is not programmable money.  You can make fiat "seem" programmable by using 3rd party services such as PayPal api's, but again, it's so cumbersome.  Crypto-currency is programmable, no 3rd party needed, it can be programmed directly and in decentralised form, so no need to trust any 3rd party at any time.
In essence, software to create DAO's, IoT devices, Bot's now have the ability to have their own bank account, no ID needed, and no 3rd party needed.  These bank accounts are called a decentralized crypto wallet.  
It's a lot to explain in a reddit post and I can't do the implications of such things any justice here, so maybe this 4 minute video linked below will help?
Here is another very short overview:
To be honest, even these videos are not doing the concepts any justice at all.
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:23:35
I appreciate the good luck wishes.  There are many reason's why I am not concerned.
1. I am a software engineer, so I "think" I understand that bitcoin is not just about it's value, even though I feel the value will end up going up in the long run,  I guess the equivalent of an electrical engineer when electricity was invented.  What can be done with a decentralized ledger blows my mind.  Probably how electrical engineers felt when electricity was new.  I bet the guy who invented electricity never imagined an Android or an iPhone.
2. This price increase and price drop in terms of percentages are not the highest percentage increase/decrease.  It's actually fairly average compared to the percentage swings from the past.
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:14:45
You're right, the people who create these things (dao's, iot's etc) will want to profit from this in the end.  They will have to decide to convert it all to fiat as and when they make profit, or they could convert to fiat as and when needed, or they could work with percentages, that would be totally up to them.
For me specifically, if I create a successful bot which earns itself a lot of crypto, I would split those earnings/profits between property, shares, precious metals, leave some in crypto, and a percentage to fiat.  But that's just me.  Others would be free to do as they wish.
I do agree with you, bitcoin price volatility is too impractical for day to day human usage for buying groceries for example.  My point is, these price fluctuations don't make any difference to these DAO's IoT's etc being created, some already exist.  I'm working on one myself, and it's so liberating that I can do this without having to worry about splashing out my ID to even more 3rd databases just itching to be hacked.
I have no idea if bitcoin will ever become stable for day to day human usage.  People still do it though, usually means they scan in a QR code, and it subtracts a certain amount of bitcoin from there account based on the current market rate.  Time will tell I guess, if crypto will become the worlds reserve currency.  I wish it does, but I have no idea if it every will (plus, although it would be nice, I don't feel that it is important for crypto's future to replace fiat).  Such a goal in my mind is a small and insignificant goal, and the future of crypto is so much bigger than that.  At the moment, I personally see it as shares or digital gold even (something which the 2nd layer lightning network might change).  You have this asset in the background, sell it when you can take profit if you need to buy something which can't be bought directly with bitcoin.
For me being in the west where the USD does not have wild swings in it's price makes fiat the better option to buy my groceries.  However, for people in other countries like Venezuela, bitcoin is a better option for them than their countries fiat currency.
With that in mind, plus the fact that there will only ever by 21 million bitcoins, plus the fact that cryptos have created new independent workers aka DAO's, IoT's, Bots etc added to value earners to the current human population, makes me believe that the average trend of crypto-currencies over the long run will continue to go up, and I completely understand there will be large price swings along the way.

I agree the price swings are wild, but the average direction is up, and up is the only direction the price can continue to go given that adoption is increasing with IoT's, DAO's, DAC's, DAPP's, Bots etc, and the supply will never go beyond 21 million.
@_date: 2018-07-02 08:12:12
Each to there own I guess.  I see the future turning towards DAO's, where centralized companies will become more and more rare.  When I say future, I mean the distant future, I don't mean tomorrow.

Middleman type jobs which includes "banks", as banks are nothing but middlemen, will have a hard time surviving in the future.  
I'm sure you'll disagree, and you have every right to disagree.  Unfortunately, disagreeing will not change the direction the future is heading towards.
