No this is my meme account I've been here for the longest. I'm 24 work in real estate and have been trading for 4 years and met some big investors because of my job. Dont lecture me on what you think you know of trading or my life when you have "sk8er" in your name like you're 15 and dont even invest in anything besides cryptos or look into them.

If you're talking about penny stocks then yeah that's all blackjack and some shit is a straight up gamble. But if you look into options/futures for example you see theres multiple strategies and even ways to hedge your investment. You cant buy the ups or downs or both simultaneously like you can options and that's where the leverage kicks in. If you day traded bitcoin I could see your argument but most of you dont even have the funds to trade actively or ambition to learn.

It's not reserved for anyone that's just a perception you have in your mind blocking you from trying to learn or make money. Anyone with $2,000 can use leverage on Robin hood it's pretty cheap to use too. You dont even need $100 to buy an option and those by nature leverage themselves. I.e) you buy an option contract for $30 it can be worth $60+ by the end of the day on a 4-5% move on a regular safe stock. You can even buy the opposite direction just in case and then sell the other, you cant do that in blackjack.
