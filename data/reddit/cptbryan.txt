With any luck.

It's a scam, brother. Stay away from it. It's just a dirty scam, propagated by a few guys who are trying to get rich quick off predatory market practices.

As a huge believer in the decentralized part of crypto, this scares me that one man can damage it like this. As far as I am concerned, non decentralized crypto is as vulnerable to abuse as fiat. This needs to be fixed somehow.

Second time in a week these guys cost me a tremendous amount of money. Done with them.

There is a special place in Hell for Roger Ver and his cronies. Hodl on brothers. That's all we can do. *We will recover.* That is a historical fact.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:34:33
It's not. It's a dirty scam.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:30:46
Coinbase is garbage. Utter trash. They are the most unreliable service, and they charge a premium price for it. I hope their adoption of Bitcoin Trash comes back to bite them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:07:30
Right. But I did click the button, and because of the exchsnges fault, my ordee wasn't filled. This wouldn't be as big an issue if there wasnt fees.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:41:08
Thanks for the headsup. He actually mentioned that to me, and I figured it wouldn't go through, but it did and I was surprised.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:54:14
Sounds about right.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:03:46
BTC core has always recovered in the face of these types of attacks. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:35:02
Be careful, the Statists will come, and in greater numbers.

I wouldn't say frequent. I believe there was to be a correction, and I've been holding coins for a while and that was good sell out point for me. I am not day trading or anything, just was looking to sell out some of the coins I was holding at an ATH.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:58:05


Yet people still defend Bitcoin Trash for some reason. I've spent a good part of this evening trying to combat that level of idiocy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:38
I got back in  Hodl on brother. Not much else to do. Go watch TV or play a game. The *worst* thing you can do is panic sell. That's what these scammers want you to do. It will come back. This isn't the first, and won't be the last attack. *This will* recover. *We will* recover.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:25:20
Yes. Do not listen to the hype. This will not last. Ride it and make the most you can while it does. The market *will* stabilize.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:49:32
When I have my coins ready to buy, at my price target, and the exchange goes down gor several minutes until the price has dumped significantly. Not to mention that I have paid premium fees on Coinbase. Customers should *never* lose money because of your company.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:16
While I understand your point, all we have to go on is historical performance data, and in this case seems to be correct, as the price is gradually climbing back.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:24:16
Evidently you are just looking to have a wise crack reply instead of a legitimate discussion, and I choose to end this conversation.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:31:14
Hodl on brother, this ain't over. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:25:49
I haven't said Coinbase should be gone. I am saying that if they expect to continue to run a profitable business, they need to improve their infrastructure. This isn't some small time operation. This is a multi million dollar corporation that needs to have the infrastructure to handle these kinds of loads.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:14:33
I most certainly do not rely on them only. However, they are the ones I *was* using as I had my bank account and debit card connected to them, whereas some of the other exchanges I use won't allow me to have my funds available immediately.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:28:44
That brings me extreme pleasure as well.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:43:36
They cost me a lot of money yesterday. You don't cost your customers money. *Especially* when they are paying premium prices for transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:42:48
Local here, might have to swing by there to support them.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:00:50
Ah. My mistake. Have an upvote fellow liberty lover. We are a rare breed on Reddit.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:12:55
Which is why they are where they are to begin with.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:36:38
Pick one.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:26:53
This. I am getting downvoted to Hell and back on other subs for even mentioning this.
P.S. Libertarian here.

That thumbnail is awesome.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:45:41
Lol. What a statist dirt sack. Don't worry, Paul. It's coming back, and with a vengence.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:03:55
Not for us who bought in when it hit below $5600.
