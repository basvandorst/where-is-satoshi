"It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed" - Jamie Dimon
Is Jamie inciting violence?

Because Bitcoin is like having cash. Those 20 million millionaires have most of their wealth tied up in traditional assets / investments. These aren't attractive to criminals because they can be easily tracked and transactions can be reversed.

I don't care

I'm keeping options open with regard to work. I have learned that I need some structure otherwise I descend into drinking or spending too much. I'm looking at buying a business just to keep myself occupied.
I quit my job because I obviously no longer needed the money. Beyond that, I increasing found it impossible to relate to any of my coworkers who had mounting debts and never had any money to spare.

No, it's a real threat with Bitcoin. I expect there will be a lot more cases of Bitcoiners being targeted.
You have no idea how many friends and family have straight up asked me to give them money. Others have made a joke that I should give them some. Behind every joke there's some truth.

No. It would create even more problems.

I'm looking into it. For now I travel and avoid social media and all my old friends and family. It probably comes across as snobbish.

This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I told my relatives I was in Bitcoin  back in 2013. 
But to be honest I'm not sure the news wouldn't have got out anyway. When my net worth went over 10 million, the first thing I did was quit my job then went traveling around the world. Those two things were enough to alienate my (financially poor) family, and enough for them to ask a lot of questions. 
When you get rich these things will change in your life:
1. Unless you really love your job you'll probably quit within a few months. 
2. You will upgrade your house / car / boat ... etc.
3. International holidays.
4. Buy expensive toys. 
All the above will be enough to give it away that you're wealthy. And if you've ever told anyone anything about Bitcoin/Crypto, they'll put it together really quick. Then you'll be the target for a home invasion.

I'm looking into overseas countries. I might buy citizenship in Malta.
