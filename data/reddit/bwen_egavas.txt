Well one of the beauty of bitcoin is that you dont really need a third party to process payments for you.
Its quite easy for anyone to setup a wallet and start processing bitcoin payments in no time at all.
@_date: 2014-01-13 16:13:15
Essentially its used as a way to Scale the difficulty for "finding" a block. So if more Hashing power gets on the network bitcoin adjust the difficulty "automaticly" to ensure there is always 1 block every 10 minutes.

With enough expertise it is somewhat easy to sell your bitcoin in real time. Most BTC exchangers offer an API for your account and using that with your private wallet to put them on sale on your exchanger after 6 confirmations is not THAT complicated.

It might not be the ideal solution but maybe keeping a certain % of sales in bitcoins for refunds is your key solution. You know how many refunds you do in a month and generaly know how much you should put aside. And even then I dont think everyone is going to rush and start paying only in bitcoins. So that is an even less % to put aside.
I understand its an additional risk for the company, but it can also be a benefice. Goes up or down. 
If it does go down then is the lost of greater than the gain you are getting by avoiding third party money exchangers ?
@_date: 2014-01-06 12:39:15
I agree with veryshiny.
One of the point of bitcoin is to decentralize money and avoid the "middle man". Using a hosted wallet service does exactly that: You have someone ELSE in control of your money.
Hosted wallet service centralize the use of bitcoin which imo goes against of the core belief of bitcoin itself.
I am not saying i'm against it. If people want to use those service go right ahead. But I like the option of not using it. If hosted service goes down or some authorities put pressure on that hoster it wont effect me   :)

You are right, my comment was hasty and deprived of logic. I just dont like LN.
@_date: 2016-03-07 11:38:12
I disagree, the whole point is to hold bitcoin yourself. Or better yet to use bitcoin as a currency not an investment medium. Bitcoin imo is a CURRENCY and it should be used for transactions not for long term holding. So when I see a new service all about investment for bitcoin... Yeah I think its bad.
@_date: 2016-03-09 10:49:12
It does, remember that guy that bumped into you? Thats right...
@_date: 2016-03-07 12:37:03
I totally agree. As long as the "service" does not require modifying the core of bitcoin to work, I believe many different layers will popup on top of bitcoin to accommodate various type of people. All I am saying is that I feel like it is encouraging people to use bitcoin as an investment rather than a currency. Which to me is "bad" for the long term.

If they are not ALL stored on bitcoin's blockchain then they are NOT bitcoins.


Have to rely on them but dont have to trust them? How did that make sense for ya? I have to trust them to stay up when a DDOS is launched against them. I have to trust their infrastructure to be able to scale. Trust &amp; rely go hand in hand i'd think.
@_date: 2016-03-07 12:29:51
I agree with you, it is a currency. As long as I can use bitcoin as a currency other entities can create their little layers on top of it and I dont care. I'm a strong believer that bitcoin should stay a decentralized ledger which everyone can contribute to without asking permission to  (or going through) any third party.

I wouldnt say worthless. You can always make little wallets with smaller amounts and print the private keys as QRCodes. Then even if the power goes out for awhile you can still use bitcoin as barter exchanging QRCodes on papers. Like it was mentioned, trust is involved.
But seriously we are not talking apocalyptic scenarios, I dont think. We are talking about a financial crisis.
@_date: 2015-08-21 12:21:09
Why wouldnt they just use bitcoin as a currency instead of an investment ? Aka: trade their bitcoins for supplies. In a crisis people might not want worthless paper money.

I think that the average person is used to be hand held and if they mess up (which they usually do) the current system is there to "save" them from themselves.
With bitcoin they are responsible to whatever happens to their money. Most are not ready for this. They are too used to have recourse with the banks and credit card companies.
With great power comes great responsibilities.
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:36:36
I wouldnt worry too much, one of the strong point of bitcoin is that its decentralized and thus no one controls it. If a Government or any private entity starts something they are going to want control over it and make profit. Hence why bitcoin will always prevail.
@_date: 2016-02-13 16:36:55
The whole point of bitcoin is that you can transfer money to anyone WITHOUT ASKING a third party.

My advice is start very small and have fun with it. Go through an exchange and transfer 100$, move smaller amounts to different kind of wallets: Online, Cold storage (offline), Semi-online. There is no SILVER bullet, take the one that you feel comfortable with. If you want to secure your cash its up to YOU, no one else.
@_date: 2018-03-03 11:07:08
@_date: 2015-09-14 10:11:15
I would use local bitcoins in small amounts. Then its really up to you how you make it cross the borders. Snail mail on a usb drive (while keeping the private key till receiver moves the funds). You could also encrypt the private key with PGP with the receiver' public key and just send it through regular email.  Either way i'd suggest trying, whatever method you chose, in smaller amounts first then increasing it.

As long as it does not affect the bitcoin blockchain, they can do / try anything they want. Its when their software require certain bitcoin core changes (or non-change) in other to work that I have a problem with (*Which i'm not saying its the case with the Lightening network*). Or if they try to force everyone to use said software and prevent everyone from transacting directly with the bitcoin blockchain. Thank you for the information, I really thought it was proprietary. :)

Legalizing bitcoin makes it harder to acquire it since all the exchanges have to comply with various laws. If bitcoin is illegal then the underground that sells bitcoin have to comply with nothing thus easier to sell &amp; buy?

Bitcoin scales superbly! Whatever the amount of transactions a block is always made every 10 minutes (6 confirmations x 10 minutes = 60 minutes = 1 hour) and it is intentionally 10 minutes and should stay that way. The blocks can contain "any" number of transactions and thus is scalable.
The limitation is NOT due to the "Proof of Work". Yes the concept "Proof of Work" is used to attach transactions to a block in the chain. But that is adjustable. We could generate a block every seconds if we wanted to by just scaling down the "Proof of Work" difficulty.




If you know another system that is better suited for micro transactions, let me know which system would let you send $1.00 across the world without any charges or transaction fees.

The safest way to store bitcoin imo is with Bitcoin Armory wallet.
Install the client, create wallet, print its paper backup, then make the wallet you just created on your machine a watch-only wallet (thus destroying the private key and the posibility to transfer bitcoins from that wallet).
If you ever want to sign transactions for your wallet you can restore your paper backup on your machine and send out bitcoins and then make it watch-only again.
its the best for "computer illiterates" imo.
For the tech savvy I would suggest a bit more lengthy with multiple wallets (long term &amp; short term). Where the short term is on your internet machine and the long term never touchs the net (Sign offline transaction on a cold machine).

For long term wallet (Which I almost never move money) I have a simple paper backup from the bitcoin-armory secured somewhere. The private key is not on any computer and I just send my recurring investments to my wallet address.
For my short term I also have a paper backup secured somewhere and a backup of the wallet file on an USB key. At home I just leave it on the computer which is connected to the tubes. Only have funds on there which I dont mind losing.
Highly recommend reading: 
And learning about a paper backup. Forget the cold storage if its too complicated for you. One paper backup then delete the wallet. Its not rocket science. It is a good thing to learn about cold storage to see how to securely (offline) move funds from your long term wallet though.
Advice: Unless you are daily trading I would avoid ALL ONLINE wallets services which are just big bulleyes for hackers. And avoid leaving your bitcoins at the exchanger which is an even bigger bulleyes for hackers.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:28:22
Transaction Fees can be optional. It is an incentive for miners to pick up your transaction and put it on the public ledger.
Most Bitcoin client defaults to 0.0005 they let you change that. Most Web wallet do not let you change the transaction fee.
And I quote 
A transaction may be safely sent without fees if these conditions are met:
* It is smaller than 10,000 bytes.
* All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.
* Its priority is large enough (see the Technical Info section below)

IMO thats exactly what fiat currencies came to be. First it was backed by gold and silver. We had silver and gold certificates (call them IOUs if you want) and eventually the IOUs were printed out of thin air so much that we couldnt back them up with real value anymore and the only thing left to do was to cut all ties with REAL value.
I dont believe in a **debt system** anymore.

I love Armory: 
It recently saved my wallet, I had forgotten my pass phrase (because I made it too complex). All I had to do is restore a paper backup from Armory and ALL my addresses were restored and it let me pick a NEW passphrase for my wallet. :D
And just the fact that I can send money on a monthly basis to essentially a paper backup (no offline storage) for long term saving is just fantastic. :]

Well like I said, for the "computer illiterates" its just easier to install armory and create wallet on the online computer. Download the software, unplug internet cable (or wifi) and then create your wallet. Print paper backup then make it a Watch-only wallet which essentially deleted the private key from the computer. Once this is done you have a perfect long term 101% secured wallet.
Please note that once the wallet is watch-only you will not be able to send out bitcoins from your wallet to the outside. But you will be able to send bitcoins to your wallet no problem. Perfect for Long Term saving.
Then you can have a "Fun" wallet which is a wallet that is always connected to the internet and you just send funds to it for purchases.
NOTE: this is with Armory Bitcoin Client.
