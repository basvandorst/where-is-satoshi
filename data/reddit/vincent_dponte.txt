Yes however almost nobody here can sustain that, just for an example i as a part-time worker and student would need approximately 25$ (or about 0.005 BTC at current price) a month to pay all my expenses and eat 3 times a day.   
The thing is how to get the money and sadly the response is that most people here (including yours truly) just don't get it and therefore have a very hard time with food and almost anything that involves payment of any kind.

A friendly word of caution. No it is NOT the same as in the US, not even close. Also any other venezuelan will be offended by having someone ask why would a person here need 5 times the minimum wage.

Sorry i should clarify.  
Rent = 15$ per month just for a room, internet and a shared bathroom.  
The rest goes to food, and still i would be eating small rations in all 3 meals.  
The minimum wage here is nothing more than a joke, i would advise caution in comparing it with almost any minimum wage in other countries. and no, it is not the minimum to live (here) in any sense or manner. Just my rent is 3 times the minimum.

Then i really hope you are currently living in china and have learned about their history and laws. Since economically they "are" socialist only in name.

Not only sell them, Gold and silver usually have to be hidden here. The GNB (National ""guard"") often times try to steal anything made of valuable metals in claims that those are strategic assets and belong to the government, most times they are successful.  
Also that's is NOT the fault of the US government, nor is this crisis.
