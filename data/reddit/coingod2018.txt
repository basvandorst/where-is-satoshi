Been hearing this since 3 thousand.. if i have noticed something about bitcoin it does not wait for no one. It will probably go back down but it will go straight back up with everyone buying on the dip. If you want profit check out b3 coin it can only go up!!

So think of it like this.. bitcoin has to hit 15k for you to double your money. It WILL happen but can you wait and ride the roller coaster without selling?

Its good and you control the private keys. Just dont lose the private key

I think i was going to buy some years ago but the mt gox hack scared the shit out of me. I was more interested in the hackers than bitcoin i was watching from the sidelines.. now im in the game. I was doing i.t courses and had ubuntu in 2013 bitcoin was staring me right in the face. I was watching videos on bitcoin in 2013 and type in bitcoin now and i see the same videos i watched back then. Rt and max keiser its all coming back to me i need to have a drink aswell

Im buying back at a lower price
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:59:37
What if satoshi sells his coins in 2021? The price will fly down but honestly i still think bitcoin would overcome that.
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:18:12
Buy and hodl
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:30:25
Read the white paper.. when satoshi gets his bitcoins in 2021 if he sells the price will fall back down quick

I remember doing my tafe course in i.t and started researching julian assange, tor, silkroad, this was early 2011 maybe even 2010 and i then found out about bitcoin. I dropped out of my tafe course and learned alot by reasearching online. I had ubuntu and was really into computers. I would code for hours at tafe and hours when i got home. I would also research people like elon musk, bill gates, warren buffet and of course this all led me to satoshi nakamoto and doing research on craig wright and nick szabo and alot of other people. Long story short i never purchased bitcoins in those days and i regret it ALOT. im not making the same mistake twice. I believe in bitcoin and the blockchain. TO THE MOON!!
