The way I think, is a situation with high inflation usually comes with high interest rates. High inflation will erode your money, but high interest rates will compensate for it. And most people don't keep a lot of cash in the mattress.
If you take $1 from 1900, it has lost a lot of value until today. But if you would have earned interest rate from it, I don't think you would have lost much, if anything at all.
There are extreme scenarios, like war and such things, but Bitcoin probably won't help much in that case.

Thanks, it is nice with some more detailed explanation now and then. 
To defend the article, I think the following scenario may be plausible? 
Low interest rates from the central bank may decrease the interest rate for normal people. That may increase the will to invest in something. All other things equal, it should increase the demand for bitcoin. 
I think it is interesting that inflation doesn't seem to increase. It is as if a lot of countries try to undercut each other when it comes to interest rate, but they fail to deprecate the value of their fiat as everyone else is doing the same thing.

If Bitcoin is the best solution, people will use it. If there are better alternatives, people will change. Eventually, the users usually get the best solution. I suppose developers don't really need to update, as there will be other implementations.

A lot of the value of both ether and bitcoin stems from hodlers. The intrsinsic value is still quite low. If you can get a profit just from being a hodler, then it is quite attractive. Switching from POW to POS is kind of a win-win-win; you make profits, the network is more secured and the eletricity goes down.
However, I think the actual rewards from POS are going to be quite low. It is not impossible that you will make more profits lending your currency for margin trade.

This business model is exciting, but is it realistic? A mining chip is very expensive. If the chip+electricity costs more than the bitcoin mined, the solution is more expensive than having devices pre-loaded with bitcoin.
It can be argued that mining chips will become cheaper because of Moore's law, but that doesn't help. If they do, difficulty will increase just as much to compensate for this. We can safely assume that only large scale and highly optimized mining companies will be able to mine with a profit.

No need to go into details. If there is an invention on an altcoin that makes something better for me as a user, then it will be to my advantage if Bitcoin is extended with this improvement.
This is what drives the improvement of most consumer goods in free markets, and there is no reason to think the same principle would not apply to blockchains.
Of course, not all changes on altcoins will match with Bitcoin as there are different design strategies.

I think the article got it wrong. Most central banks want a small and controlled inflation. Almost no one wants high inflation, and here Bitcoin will one day help. But for the moment, Bitcoin inflation (4%) is higher than most fiats.
The argument of the article is that people would be encouraged to change from fiat to bitcoin to get lower inflation. That is currently not the situation in most countries. There are countries with damaging high inflation, but they are not using negative interest rates.

Bitcoin can't explode, the number of transactions are almost at the ceiling. Or are you talking about the price?


That could also be the problem. Most of the value of bitcoin comes from future expectations, not from the current utility. If nothing change, you have to play down your future expectations, which can result in a falling price.

That can't be correct. All normal demand/supply functions show falling demand when price goes up.
However, it is well established that an increased demand will lead to an increased price. If an increased price would also lead to an increased demand as you say, the price function would become unstable, and either tend to infinity or 0.

Supply and demand isn't the amount that was actually traded. Demand is usually used to represent how much is desired by buyers, and supply representants how much the market can offer.

The current HW is not Bitcoin-subsidized, as it would be cheaper without the miner. Electricity is a precious resource in many developing countries, making it improbable in the future that improved HW would make mining profitable. This use case looks unreasonable to me.

Right. But people voting for this doesn't understand the consequences. As a lot of the money is created by the banks, the economy of the society will slow down catastrophically for several years when everyone have to pay back their loans. The credit crunch of 2008 will look like a minor thing.
One consequence could be that the central bank takes over the complete responsibility of the lending market.

You are basing your prediction from a model you describe. The funny thing about economic models is that they really have to include a dependency on itself. That is, if you have a perfect model, and others knows it, everyone can predict in advance what will happen, which in turn will make the model invalid. So the model has to include itself to be valid. That makes them recursive and unstable.
Hence, the model that eventually turns out to be best, can't be the one that a majority believed in.

Possible, but I think this would be a precarious proposition. It would be susceptible to the usual 51% attack. That means that the bank would either have to supply enough hashing power on its own to protect against that, or enlist enough external mining elsewhere. Just like an altcoin.

@_date: 2014-03-29 17:09:37
Interesting comments, and I agree mostly.


Depending on how you see it, it can be argued that the currency issuer (FED) is not the same as the government. In most developed countries, there are rules that prohibit the government from printing new money to cover its own debts. This is an important rule, or there may be hyper inflation as the result. So, it is not unusual that the government has to take loans from the common market.


This is a good point. However, it could be more proper to compare with the case where you lend out your BTC, and get an interest rate for it? Why would you do that? Because you can get an even better yield.
If so, you would get approximately 2% better yield from BTC than from a fiat currency. I do realize that it is not certain that you still get 2% interest rate for BTC. It would be costly for the borrowers. I don't know how the borrowing market will look like, if the BTC becomes ubiquitous.


Agreed. But the situation is a little more complex. It is not the amount of money available, it is the circulation speed of it. If half of the money is moved to cold storage, but the remaining half is used at the double speed, then there will be no price changes. This is an interesting point of Bitcoin today. Still, all things being equal, your point still holds.
Most companies immediately change their bitcoin earnings back into fiat. This means the *transaction speed* is high. That could explain why the price of bitcoin isn't going up much for a while now, despite wider adoption. I think this will change when there is wider bitcoin adoption in the business-to-business economy.


This starts to get really interesting. If the government can't use interest rate to compensate for cycles, what should they do? I am not sure, but I think they will have to save assets in a expanding market, and release assets in a contracting market. In my opinion, they should do this already, but the incentives are not very hard as they can always fall back to using the interest rate instead.
I think there are actual examples where deflationary prices still work, and the is the mobile phone industry, TV sets and computers. If you wait just another year, you will get something better for your money. But still people spend the money.

Dell is good news, which should drive the price up from speculation. But, as you say, if owners of bitcoin start using it through Dell, which will immediately sell them on the market through Coindesk, then there will be a downward pressure on the price.
My guess is that these two things cancel out.

I argue that lending and investing have many similarities. Take at the following scenario: 
1. Banks are limited to lend only invested money.
2. I start a bank. This bank doesn't accept deposits, as they can't be used.
3. However, my bank allows new investors anytime.
4. My bank will also buy back shares from investors anytime they so want.
With this setup, we get the same effect as with a traditional bank using the FRB. Customers investing money in my bank will get interest for their "deposits". It will be called "investments" on the paper, but it will behave just as deposits.

Even if miners migrated elsewhere, restoring a more distributed situation, the problem remains. Because there is currently nothing to prevent this from happening again in the future. And the next time it could be utilized by a malevolent organization.
As long as it can happen theoretically, it is a flaw of Bitcoin.

Actually, it kind of does.
If you go to the bank and request a loan of 100$, a loan be created. In the accounting of the bank, you will see the effects of your loan in two places. The funny thing here is that your 100$ will be added to the deposits account, while a dept from you to the bank is registered. Thus, the accounting is still in balance. This can be done without any third party person depositing money!
So, what happens when you use this "created" money? You pay someone, that has as an account in the same bank. Your money is simply transferred to that other account. Thus, the balance sheet still holds.
The only problem is when you try to withdraw the money from the bank. In effect, you actually transfer it to another bank. This is fine, as long as the withdrawals roughly match the deposits. If withdrawals exceed deposits, it is called a "bank run". That is why the bank is required to have a safety margin.
tl;dr The bank can (and will) create money as long as it is not withdrawn.
Notice also that this is possible when dealing with bitcoins.
Edit: If in doubt, see

If you want to buy something expensive, you either save money until you have what is needed, or you borrow it. In many developed countries, people have high debts. If lending would stop, they all have to pay back the loans before start consumption again. 
This may look like a good thing. However, it may take many years. During that period, people will buy less than usual, which will be detrimental to the economy as it will slow down.
There is also lending in the form of investments. E.g. buying shares of a business. That is a major way to finance business today.

Some people think bitcoin is going to be deflationary. Given a (hypothetical) annual deflation of 4%, and a real interest rate of 3%, the bank would have to use a negative nominal interest rate. That will not happen. A more reasonable nominal interest rate would be at least 1 to 2%. But that would give a lowest real interest rate of 5 to 6%, which is expensive.
If bitcoin gets a dominating role, and assuming it will be deflationary, then my conclusion is that loans are going to be more expensive than today. That could be a big change.

The deposits are always bigger than the loans by a fraction. That fraction is what gives the "Fraction" in FRB.
When it is said that banks create money, it is M1 they create. And M1 includes credits, but not debits.
When it is said banks create money out of "thin air", what they really do is that they create the deposit at the same time as the loan.

I think there are some important factors that drive the price of bitcoin.
* Speculation is unfortunately still the most important. The current state of ever increasing adoption should trigger a new wave of speculations, possible from institutions.
* The speed of bitcoin. Most big vendors immediately change BTC back to fiat. Because of that, the demand for BTC is low.
* When there will be more Business-to-Business, I think vendors are going to keep more of the BTC and use it on their own instead.
There are a couple of unknowns. What will be the next country to "ban" or endorse Bitcoin? Will there be another big failure like MtGox?

But isn't that just how FRB works for fiat money? It is only possible as long as you can only use it to pay someone that has the same bank. The money flow out of the bank is fine as long as the in flow is in correspondence.
Likewise, the bitcoin that is used for FRB never need to be seen on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 10:25:54


It is a common opinion among Bitcoin enthusiasts that FRB is something evil. Fact is, Bitcoin is not going to change whether we have FRB or not, just as you said.
If FRB is forbidden, you will in practice forbid lending of money. That would have huge implications to the society.

I agree that the bank can't get away with low reserves. Especially if Fed is not going to back it up (which currently seems unlikely). But it would not be reasonable to require full reserves. If you do that, the bank can't lend your BTC to anyone else. And if they can't do that, they will never pay you for doing deposits (interest rate).

I wonder if we will see a shift from consumption and investment based on lending, to an economy based on savings? It may be better.

What you describe here is exactly the same how FRB works for dollars. There will be just the same problems. E.g. if people start withdrawing too much money, you will have a "bank run" scenario.
FRB is only possible as long as all created credits stay in the same bank.
In worst case, the situation may be worse with bitcoin, as there doesn't exist regulations the same way the dollar is regulated. That's why things like mtgox can happen.
@_date: 2014-05-18 13:37:53
I don't think the goal is to have an exact increment every year, but rather an increment that match the general growth. That will give a currency that stays stable.
But the situation is more complicated. The general growth is just an average. That means some products will grow cheaper and some will get more expensive with time, anyway.
And then it gets even more complicated if you want to use the money volume to achieve other goals. E.g. fighting recessions or help improve government depths. 
Use of Bitcoin can maybe change this fundamentally.

I suppose there are three factors that directly control inflation? Money supply, production, and velocity of money. Bitcoin is obviously different to fiat money, as there is an eventual cap. But there is another interesting difference, and that is the velocity. I don't have any proof for it, but I think the velocity of BTC is very high. For example, most merchants immediately trades it back to fiat.
That could explain why the price for the BTC doesn't following the growing adoption.

A confirmation takes 10 minutes because quite a lot of computation power is required. If the difficulty would be lower, a confirmation would be faster. Suppose a confirmation would take 5 minutes. That would also make it twice as easy to fake.
Sometimes you see a recommendation to use 3 confirmations, which would take about 30 minutes. With a difficulty that is half as hard, you would need 6 confirmations to get the same level. So it would still take 30 minutes.

Banks are generally allowed to do FRB today. Why wouldn't they be allowed to do that with BTC?
If I deposit my BTC to a bank account, I maybe will prefer a bank that gives me interest. But if the bank can't lend this money to someone else, then they can't pay interest for it.
Of course, there are the usual problems with making sure the bank holds on to a sufficient fraction.

Suppose you forbid FRB. Banks can now only lend money matching their own capital. They can no longer lend money that someone else has deposited. That means that the bank can't use deposits, which in turn means that the bank would not pay any interest on deposits.
Now suppose you are saving to your pension. But saving in a bank will not give you any revenue, you would probably have to pay for the service. Instead, you will have to invest in a stock market. But why would stocks be allowed to give dividends on shares? That is just a similar mechanism as depositing money in a bank, and so it has to be forbidden also.

The loan will immediately go to someone's deposit account, in effect increasing the total deposits. And thus money is created, this is no change!
The amount of money created include all deposits, but is not adjusted for the debt people have to the bank. That is why, according to this definition, a bank can create money.
Creating money will increase the assets of the bank just as much as the liabilities, staying in balance. So the bank doesn't become richer when it creates money.

Sorry for busting your dreams, but it is perfectly possible to create bitcoin out of thin air, and thus do fractional reserve banking.
Instead of paying you 1 bitcoin, I can write a note that I owe you a bitcoin. You can now use this note to pay your own purchases. It works fine as long as people trust notes from me, which in practice is very limited.
However, similar notes from a known bank would have a higher probability of being accepted.

In the short term, anything can happen. The difficulty won't change for a while, and the rewards are down 50%. It is reasonable to expect that no miners are having big profits. That they just about go plus. Halving the income will put 100% of them on the red side, until the next difficulty change.
Question is, will they unplug the equipment to save electricity? In worst case, more than 90% would do that. In practice, they still have an investment in HW, and maybe letting it run will at least compensate for the electricity and some.

I didn't know about that scenario. Isn't it a high risk? If only a minority of the miners follow this strategy, it will fail, and they will lose money. And why would they do it, when a majority has already declared support for the fork?

One solution being used is to let people with "reputation" act as judges. The funny thing is that this reputation is something you have to pay for. The more you pay, the more reputation you get.
When it is time to report the outcome, a random selection of owners of reputation is selected. Any one of these judges not following the majority will be penalized, which would act as an incentive to judge correctly.
Participating as a judge will earn you a profit. The beauty of this is that it is decentralized and anonymous.

As over 90% of all money is created by commercial banks, this money would have to be payed back. That would effectively halt the whole economy of the country completely for many years.
&lt;sarcasm&gt;There may be a solution, which would be to have the central bank provide all the credits instead of the commercial banks. In practice, make all banking business state controlled. It would come naturally, simply nationalize all the banks that goes bankrupt.&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

Suppose I am a miner, and my objective is to prevent the 2 MB fork. To succeed using your strategy, I have to make sure at least 50% of the miners are following this strategy, or it will fail. Preferably, I need 75% to improve the transitional period.
But if 50% of the miners don't want the 2 MB fork, there is a much better strategy, and that is to not vote for this fork at all. This is better as the fork won't happen unless 75% (or so) of the miners agree, with much lower risk.
You must not forget that miners always want to maximize the profit. Your scenario would look bad indeed, and would almost guarantee a steep fall of the Bitcoin price. Miners want stability and safety, so that investors can trust the system.

My example using a note was just an example to show that FRB (fractional reserve banking) is very much possible, even when using Bitcoin. But as you say, that isn't really the interesting case.
The interesting case is how this is done by banks. Suppose I want to buy a car with bitcoin, but don't have the money. I go to a bank (doing business with bitcoin), and ask for credits. The bank creates money the usual way, adding bitcoins to my account, while simultaneously registering a debt from me. Notice that I don't have the money on my private BTC address.
Now I want to pay the car dealer, who is a also customer in the same bank. This is done by transferring money from my account to the account of the car dealer.
This example will be possible as soon as bank starts doing businesses with bitcoins. With the example, I show that Bitcoin doesn't solve the problems stated in the post I first answered.

I may have misunderstood it, but e.g. the discussion in [link]( made me think otherwise. That is, a limited bandwidth leads to higher orphan rates if the block size is increased, which would be a disadvantage for these miners.

This is when the real voting begins. After the hardfork, it is the demand for the coins in the old and new chain that will eventually decide who is the winner.

What definition is that?
What many people doesn't understand, is how consensus defines a blockchain. It is not defined by an organization or a person. The chain with the most work is the winning chain, even if it is the result of a hard fork. It has to be that way for it to be fully decentralized. There can't be someone that has the authority to declare which one is winning, or it would no longer be trustless.

@_date: 2017-03-25 18:50:27


No. It is the valid chain with most work on it, not the longest.
However, a hardfork can change the definition of "valid". In which case it is the users that decide.
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:37:11
That is kind of a circular argument, as it is the same thing as saying that the requirement on a program is the source code.

@_date: 2017-03-20 14:53:04
If one of the chains wins, you don't have to do anything at all (except refraining from doing transactions during the uncertain period).
After there is a clear winner, you will still have your coins on that chain.
If there is no clear winner, you will still have coins on both chains. To play it safe, wait until there is information on how to split the coins.

False signalling is indeed problematic. But remember it is a dangerous weapon to use. BU needs 75% to activate. Suppose 70% wants BU activation. That would not be enough to succeed. Now suppose there is another 5% from false signalling. That would be just what is needed to go beyond the activation limit. After the fork, we assume the false signals no longer supports BU. But given these numbers, BU still has enough miners to become the majority chain.
In effect, the false signalling actively helped the fork to happen.
Take a more extreme example. Suppose 50% signals honestly for BU, and 50% signals falsely. There will be a lot of articles about the near unanimous vote, and exchanges will declare they will switch to the new chain to follow the majority. The same goes for users and wallets.

You missed one important case: What happens with miners not accepting the soft fork?
They will continue producing blocks that do not fulfill the new rule. There are now two cases. If these miners are in a minority, their blocks will be orphaned when the longer chain overwrites them. If these miners are in a majority, there will be a chain split, with UASF on the shorter chain.

On the contrary, the basic idea behind the change is easy to understand.
The value of bitcoin depends on its utility. There are two main utilities today: use as a store of value, and use for payments. However, bitcoin isn't scaling as fast as some would prefer. Because of that, the utility for payments is severely lacking. That is what BU wants to address. They may not do it in a way you prefer, but that is not what you are arguing about.

Ok, i'll try to take it more pedagogically then.
A hardfork enables things that were not allowed previously. They don't have to, but they can be backward compatible (but we know for sure they are not forward compatible). E.g. an increase of maximum block size from 1 to 2MB is such a hardfork. That new SW will accept all old blocks, as well as any new blocks from the old SW. Such a hardfork is thus backward compatible.


They can build blocks on the old chain. So if the old chain overtakes the new chain, the new SW will accept it as valid. Because it is backwards compatible!
Now, a softfork is forwards compatible. They will use the same rules as the old SW, but add a restriction. A typical example (from real life in Bitcoin!) is decreasing the block size limit. All blocks produced by this SW will still be accepted by the old SW.

In game theoretic, that is sometimes called "bribing". Mining Bitcoin costs about $2 million per day. Bribing a majority to follow another  chain would be very costly indeed.

Miners that use the old software (not supporting SW) will produce blocks that are ignored by the new nodes. If the old miners are in majority, they will create the longest chain. That will give you a consensus failure, with two chains and SW on the shorter one.

The objective of the miners is to optimize their profits. No less, no more. Any other expectation, and we have a situation where we have to trust the miners to do the morally right thing. If so, Bitcoin is no longer trustless.
Bitcoin on the other hand, as a system, has the objective to optimize the utility fot the users. It is using game theory to incentivize the miners. If properly constructed, miners optimizing profits will also at the same time optimize utility for the users of Bitcoin. If not, the incentives are incorrectly configured.

Suppose BU has 75% of the mining power, and also suppose that the price of the BU token is 4 times as high, this means that miners remaining on the old chain will continue mining for something like 4x2 weeks, with 1/4 of the profit they would get on the new chain. After 2-3 weeks, the BU chain will fall in difficulty corresponding to the 25% of miners that left. At that point in time, a miner on the old chain will have profits equal to 3/4 * 1/4 = less than 20% of what the would get if they change to the longer chain. And they have to continue like that for more than 5 weeks. It is going to be very costly, and miners in it for the money will probably switch.

The general consensus is that it is not physically possible to restart a chain 6 blocks back in time. Restarting it 475000 blocks back is also impossible.

All your coins will immediately be available on both chains. This might look as a good thing. Twice the number of coins for nothing. But the total value of these coins might be worth less than before the fork. These two set of coins are not fungible.
There are two safe options. Doing nothing, waiting for the dust to settle. It may take a couple of days, no one knows for sure. If the old chain won, everything is as before. If the new chain won, wait to make sure your exchange/wallet/node supports it, and everything is a before again. 
The other safe option is to sell your coins before the fork.
There are going to be people that like to speculate during the fork. Suppose you are confident that one of the chains will win, and the other die out eventually. If so, the coins on the winning chain will eventually get back to the same price as before the fork. Now, if you know what you are doing it is possible to sell the losing coins immediately after the fork to people that are convinced about the opposite outcome.

As for softfork, it is easy to show that the miners are in control. No matter what the users want, the miners have it in control because you can't force the miners.
@_date: 2016-01-20 22:18:07


No, what is that rule?
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:57:59
Well, I agree it is the users that have the final say. If the demand is on one of the chains, this is the token that is going to have a value, and so this is the chain that will make the most profit for mining.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:49:01


Notice that the possible number of transactions will also go down to 1/4 in case of a 75% majority for BU. But the number of transactions on BU can go up, even if the number of blocks for a couple of weeks is down by 25%.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:02:58


These miners believe that this will improve Bitcoin. That means it is not irrational. Sure, they may be wrong, but that is what they believe.
80% node counts doesn't have much impact in this question. That is not enough to stop a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:56:53
Yes, that is the danger of false signalling.
Supposing there is 75% signalling for a hardfork, the following happens:
1. At some point in time, the orphaning of blocks not signalling for BU begins.
2. All miners will start signalling for BU. Some of them falsely.
3. At the day of the hardfork, 100% are signalling for BU. After the hardfork, all miners that used a false signalling will reject big blocks. But as 75% of the miners already supported the fork to begin with, we know that less than 25% are signalling falsely.
4. Miners that signaled falsely for BU now rejects big blocks. But they are a minority, or step one would never happen.
The end result may be that false signalling will encourage the hardfork to succeed.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:29:25
I suppose you mean the SW? That seems to improve the scaling. But I think this is not accepted as good enough by some people.
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:38:42
Congratulations. If you have to trust the miners to do their work, Bitcoin is no longer trustless. If so, it has a problem with the incentive system.
@_date: 2016-01-20 22:25:18
That is where he gets it wrong. Bitcoin has a utility, and as such, there is a demand for it. If there is a demand, and the supply is limited, there will be a value also. That is the basics of economy, you learn it first year when studying economics.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:57:24
I think it is unlikely that there will be an attack in the form where they mine some kind of illegal or otherwise damaging blocks on another chain. This will cost a lot of missed opportunity on mining on the longest chain.
It is much more rational to simply mine on the longest chain, making it more viable by the users. Users care a lot about a safe and usable chain.
@_date: 2016-01-24 07:01:23
The price of bitcoin is very volatile. That means it goes up and down a lot on short notice, although it has improved in stability the last year. A volatile price is good only for traders that want to do frequent buy and sell. For users of bitcoin, a stable price (or stable slow increase) is better. Trading a volatile asset is risky.
Suppose you get your salary in bitcoin, and are planning to buy a TV set. But when you go to the vendor, the price of bitcoin has fallen, and you can no longer buy the TV set. The risk of this happening will keep people away from bitcoin. Sure, it can go up also, but we don't know. Because of this high volatility, many vendors accepting bitcoin prefer not to own any. They sell them for US$ immediately, or whatever local currency.
The top price at almost 1200 US$ is generally believed to be the result of market manipulation. At that time, the majority of trading was done at one exchange, Mt. Gox. I recommend you to buy a small amount now and then, and plan to keep it for several years. Don't try to time the buy and sell, it is only pure luck. Even better, get some bitcoin, and use them. That will help the network grow.

Not as much as I want, and I know others that want more scaling. Maybe you won't find any on this subreddit, but that is no proof.




A change from 1 to 2 MB blocks would enable twice as many transactions per second. That is much more than "no effect".
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:54:25


Agreed. That is why you can't force miners to accept a soft fork. That is why I can't understand why a "User Activated Soft Fork" can work.
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:59:51
That is exactly why it was wrong doing SW as a softfork. It entirely depends on miners to decide. If miners don't want to follow a SF, they can safely ignore it.
Hardforks, on the other hand, is controlled by the users. Doing SW as a hardfork would leave the miners no option.
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:59:11


Lol, funny to read. Actually, Bitcoin is harder regulated than any fiat currency.

With fewer blocks per hour, the number of transactions have to go down correspondingly. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:05:42
You will not know that until after the fork. You can see that on the price on the two tokens, which is indirectly drivern by the demand.
@_date: 2016-01-02 19:25:55
Interesting comparisons, although not always fair. Fair, as in "not the complete truth".


A BTC transaction can be reversed. That is why it is usually recommended to wait 6 blocks for confirmation.


BTC currently has a yearly inflation at about 10% if you look at the number of bitcoin. If you look at the value of bitcoin, which depends on the supply vs demand, it had high inflation 2014, and was deflationary 2015.
 


If you go to a random vendor anywhere in the world, the chance that VISA is accepted is higher than the chance that bitcoin is accepted.

I think the situation will get mote toxic the closer we come to the hardfork.

There is a problem with this. For BU to succeed, they really need a majority of the users, no matter what hash power the miners have when there is a hardfork. If BU doesn't have the users, it will fail, and the current Bitcoin chain will win. But if BU actually have a majority of the users, then there is no meaning with a fork with an updated POW. It will still be a minority chain, and it will probably not be called Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-29 07:20:22
There are solutions used by other blockchains that supports mining of uncles. It seems to work fine, could it be adopted?
I am not sure how to handle the increase of mined bitcoin, as I think the ultimate limit of 21 million is non negotiable.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:10:24
Actually, there is. After a hardfork, the demand from users will determine the price of the tokens. That is the ultimate measure, as it will indirectly control the hash power.
@_date: 2016-06-29 08:18:02
They can't take down Bitcoin. But they can disrupt the ramps needed to get bitcoin. E.g. preventing exchanges from trading. It won't stop Bitcoin, but it will slow down adoption and it will keep legal companies away.
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:32:49
I think attracting new speculators will indirectly drive adoption when they try to use bitcoin. And when they do, the intrinsic value will go up.

If you lend 100$ to me, I'll give you a receipt. You can now use this receipt (IOU) next time you go shopping. Sure, most vendors won't trust a receipt from me, put my friends do. You have now created money! There is no magic or thin air needed. 
Money created by banks have the advantage that it has a wider acceptance. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 23:30:38


I think that is wrong. If you have any significant money, you invest it. Investment profits correlate with inflation. Higher inflation gives higher interest rates.
If you only have insignificant amount of money, the inflation will be insignificant.

And so, your conclusion is wrong.
Still, I agree the use of a hard fork is bad, however it is initialized.
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:34:54


That depends on who you ask.


It seems people doesn't understand how big problem it is when scaling transactions is lagging behind too far. Ultimately, it can kill the business ideas of Bitpay and similar companies.


Now, you are walking on thin ice. You have to define exactly what "Bitcoin" is first, and there is no such definition. At least none that everyone agrees on. My favorite one is based on the white paper. That is, the longest chain. Or even better, the chain with the most work. If BU fails, they will not produce the chain with the most work, so this definition should satisfy everyone.
With that definition, everyone knows exactly what is bitcoin all the time, and there is no need to explain anything.
There can be no official definition of what Bitcoin is, as that would be a form of centralization. So it has to be consensus drivern.


This is very interesting, as the financial sector and law system doesn't know very well how to handle a cryptocurrency. They certainly have a lot to learn and adapt to.
There is the scenario of Ethereum splitting into Eth and Etc. It simply has to accepted that this can happen to any cryptocurrency, and big operations not taking this into account haven't understood how it works.


The future will be interesting. It will be the survival of the fittest.
@_date: 2016-06-28 11:50:34
I can see at least two reason this doesn't work yet:
1. Bitcoin is volatile, even. That makes it a bad asset to use for backing something. Sure, bitcoin has been less volatile than gold for a short time, but that just goes to show that maybe gold isn't a good backer either.
2. The market cap of bitcoin is 10 billion US$. This is not enough to back up any real fiat currency (except possibly some smaller ones).

If it succeeds, it will be very profitable. They will eventually double the profits from transactions.  And a blockchain that can service twice the number of users is also worth twice as much. Which will translate into a higher price of bitcoin. Again, a win for the miners (and the users).

Invested money doesn't matter on the day of the halvening, the only thing that matter is the price of electricity. If the price is too high you would lose less money if you stop mining, compared to continue mining.
Problem is, I suppose, that we don't know very well what the price of electricity is for all miners.

Why would they? It should be the opposite. Doubling the number if transactions benefits everyone. It is a win-win.

Some miners will stay from an ideological point of view. But I think most miners do it for the profits. The change will be on the margin, which could be huge.
E.g. suppose that BCH would give 10% more revenues. If the miner costs corresponds to 90% of the revenue, then a 10% increase would actually double the profits. It will vary  from miner to miner, of course.

If it stabilizes or not, depends on the size of the selfish miners. Take the extreme example that 100% are selfish. That means that all miners will allways choose the same chain. Such a system is by definition not stable.
@_date: 2016-06-29 07:14:30
Of course it is rigged, and it is easy to show.
The main example is how the interest rate is used to control the inflation. The whole purpose of this IS to have it rigged. There are discussions whether inflation is good or not, and whether the control is effective or not, but that is beside the point.
I think the use of the word "rigged" is what makes this poll problematic.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:14:19
If you are talking about issuance rate, then yes, they have the same. Which means a maximum of 21 million coins.
However, because of various technicalities, Bitcoin Cash is currently mined too fast. If that will change, or not, I don't know. Anyway, the issuance rate just now is higher for BCH, but the total maximum remains the same.
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:33:10
Eventually, adoption will have grown to fill all new space, and fees will be back the current level again. If it is so dangerous to do a 2x, we should plan for it already now. To have it all ready when it is needed.

@_date: 2017-08-15 14:28:02
The way I like to see it, is that there are 21 million bitcoin, and has always been. But it wasn't until the first mining started that these bitcoin became available, and could be used.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:39:57
I suppose we can first wait and see. The next difficulty change (300%) is in approx 15 hours. I am afraid that the change will push BCH far out into the non profitable mining territory, and we will again have to rely on contribution from miners not looking for the profit.
Probably, the special fix for difficulty reduction will kick in. However, this is also not good in the long term. BCH will, on average, mine more than one block per 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:36:50
At that point, fees and transaction times will be back to what we have today (supposing adoption has exactly doubled). This may look like no progress at all, but that is not the case. At that time, we will actually serve twice the number of users. The total capacity of Bitcoin will have doubled.
So it is a win from the users point of view. And miners will also be very happy, as they will double the total fees compared to today. That explains why they want SegWit2x.
Finally, hodlers will also be very happy. The reason for this is that a Bitcoin that can handle twice as many users will have its utility doubled. That means that the value of Bitcoin, the blockchain, will double. This will translate into a higher bitcoin price (although it may not be exactly a factor of 2).
It is only amateurs running nodes that will suffer.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:58:09


Agreed. The question then is, how does the hivemind process work?

It grows sub linearly with time, not exponentially.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:14:59


I agree, but that is not the problem here. If we have a case where a significant hashpower switch between the two chains depending on which is more profitable, then block times will also change significantly. E.g. 30% slower blocks on BTC for a period would be damaging.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:35:08
With hard forks, blocks that were valid before the fork would not be valid after the fork. There is no need for the concept of "longest chain" or "most work" here. For example, the POW could be changed, which means comparing longest chain is no longer relevant.
A chain split is when there is a fork where both chains continue to follow the same consensus rules. An orphaned block is an example of a chain split that actually happen now and then. A more severe example of a chain split could be a network compartmentalization, which would merge when the networks come in contact with each other again. An even severe example of a chain split could be a 51% attack with the intent of forcing a chain reorganization so as to wipe a transaction from the history.
@_date: 2017-08-19 07:42:31


But it isn't. The concept is completely ignored, as if there is an agenda to never do it. This could have been started years ago.
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:38:46
That is the argument that bigger blocks increase the risk of being orphaned. But no evidence that the 2x is going to be problematic.
And then, the increased transaction fees will somewhat compensate for the increased orphan risk. 
Edit: found this elsewhere


So I ask again, is there any technical argument? Or is it all just FUD, drive by some hidden agenda?
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:50:13

for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for

about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would

@_date: 2017-08-24 17:27:39
Yes. But mining profitability is given by the price in relation to the difficulty. Even if the price falls, difficulty will eventually catch up, making either chain more profitable than the other.
In the current situation, price of BCH is approx 1/7 of BTC. Yet, we still have the wild swings despite a huge difference in "confidence".
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:01:23
Suppose we start at some kind of equilibrium for the fees. What happens when you double the block weight? 
To begin with, the fee per transaction will fall. The total fees per block maybe falls also. With time and growing adoption, the fees will start climbing again. Eventually, we will be back at the same fee level per transaction. 
At that point, we are servicing twice as many users. Doubling the number of users mean that the total value of the Bitcoin blockchain also has doubled.  
The strain on the network and hw cost for the miners are negligible. They don't care if they can get this massive increase of profits.

My argument is that they will eventually get twice as much fees. And not only that, a higher value of Bitcoin will probably increase the value of a bitcoin, which will give more miner rewards.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:30:35


Nodes in itself adds no security. If you run a node, and if you have your wallet on this node, then it will help you, but no one else.
Of course, a miner not connected to a pool also need to run a node.

BCH currently has 1/8 the difficulty of BTC. If the difficulty falls another 50% in the weekend, it will be at 1/16.
If 100% of the miners switch to BCH, it means they will mine 2016 blocks in 1/16 of the normal time. That would be almost 2 blocks per minute. Not realistic, but theoretically possible.
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:41:58
Maybe you don't know how a blockchain works. Ethereum is based on Proof Of Work, where miners creates new blocks. This is no more centralized than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:32:41
It is the miners that want bigger blocks.
Suppose the current fees are at an equilibrium. Increasing blocksize will certainly decrease the fee per transaction, and maybe also the total fees per block. But everyone expect adoption to continue to grow. Eventually, we are back to the same fee level again (equilibrium). At that point, miner rewards from fees will have grown substantially.
The number of users has also multiplied. That means that the value of Bitcoin as a system has also multiplied. This should lead to a higher value per bitcoin.
From a miner perspective, this is better than technology that  moves transactions offchain. From people running nodes, they may not be happy about this. But that is not a concern of the miners.
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:06:58


Is it really? What do you mean with "security"?


If an economic majority would want to change something, shouldn't that be fine? Not that I ever think a majority would want to remove the 21 million limit, specifically. The miners maybe would like to increase that, but it would never be accepted by the users.
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:34:38
The value depends on the utility (current and future). The utility is usually the ability to send transactions without trust in a third party. Some altcoins have more advanced utility, for example running smart contracts.
It gets complicated as the utility usually grows with a network effect (n\*log(n)). 
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:25:31
Agreed. Problem is, miners are doing what they are expected to be doing: Maximizing profits. Nothing else can ever be expected. That means that the difficulty adjustment algorithm is the real problem here.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:56:41
No need for that. You can verify it at any blockchain explorer. If you are paranoid, use two different explorers.
Yes, if you are doing large amount of transactions. Maybe you are running an exchange, then it is a good idea to run a node.
If I send you money, and you don't trust me, any blockchain explorer is good enough.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:07:40
Any change in price will have no effect, except temporary. If one of the coins fall in value by a factor of 100, difficulty will adjust, and eventually they will again start oscillating between being most profitable to mine.
Profitability is given by the difficulty in relation to the price, not only one of them in isolation.
The problem is inherent with the Bitcoin difficulty update algorithm. Having a period of 2016 doesn't work when there is more than one chain.

While true, you can see it in a different way. Every day, someone has to buy bitcoin for 1800*4000= $7.2 million. That is new money that has to enter the market. New users or speculators have to be found, every day, just to be able to maintain the current price. Halving this can be significant.

How did you come yo that conclusion? For every node you add, there is a chance you add another hop, which means you slow down the network.

This is kind of a ridiculous comment. If the number of bitcoin would have been set to 21 billion instead of 21 million, there would have been no difference. Bitcoin would have worked just as well, with no changes whatsoever (except the position of the decimal point).
It is almost as saying that 1 micro bitcoin is really cheap. Everyone can afford to buy 1 micro bitcoin. That is fantastic!
I remember the old days when some journalists came to the conclusion that  the price of bitcoin was too high. They compared it to dollar or euro, and didn't understand that the number of decimals make it work perfectly anyway.
Another thing that also makes me really annoyed, is when the price of 1 bitcoin is compared to 1 ounce of gold. That is another kind of a completely arbitrary comparison. Why don't they compare to 1 millibitcoin? Why don't the compare with 1 kg gold? Or compare with 0.5 ounce gold? The comparison is just arbitrary.

In pyramid schemes, an increasing inflow of new speculators pay off old users (that gets a profit). In this case, the "new money" is paying the miners, so not really earlier owners.
Still, it can be argued that Bitcoin is a pyramid game. However, Bitcoin has a utility, which makes all the difference. The utility is the possibility to send transactions quickly and safely (to a relatively low price), anywhere in the world.
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:19:13
Sometimes, I get the feeling it is not about helping people. If they withdraw bitcoin from exchanges, it will make it harder to sell them again. Not difficult, just another hurdle. That should lower the supply side, and increase the price.

You just just managed to complain to both sides of the coin.
With positive interest rates and inflation, your money will gradually be worth less (unless you deposit it for interest). That is where you complain about "depreciated 98% during the last century".
With negative interest rates and deflation, your money will become worth more (unless you deposit it for interest). That is where you complain "So to hold their fiat money you now have to pay them".
@_date: 2017-01-04 02:16:50


Why couldn't it?


To some extent, correct. If you plan to buy something, the price can change quite a lot if you delay your purchase.


Using his comparison, gold would also be classified as a pyramid scheme. As bitcoin can also be used, you do not depend on a Greater Fool. You can, although somewhat limited, use bitcoin to buy things. That means the comparison to pyramid schemes fails.


This is correct. A constant influx is needed, or the inflation would constantly decrease the value.


That classifies the article for a member in the obituary list. Thing is, there is a demand, a finite supply, and a utility. Thus it **will** have a value and the conclusion is wrong.

They slow down the network. Every extra node may mean another hop is needed for messages.


Miners will validate blocks anyway. And then, there are no invalid blocks or transactions normally. This only happens in the case of an attack. That means that the functionality as a sink is never used.


A hardfork is risky because it is contentious. It is contentious because it is risky. Now, there is a circular argument here.
It is just as valid to say a hard fork is safe because it is unanimous.  And as it is safe, it is just a protocol upgrade everyone is happy with.

If you have an unconfirmed Tx, it is difficult to speed it up. The best is to use the proper transaction fee right from the start.
However, there is something called [Replace-by-Fee]( It replaces the unconfirmed transaction with a new one, with a higher fee. I have never used that, so I am not sure about the details. I think it is very unusual. My guess is that you need support from your client for this, and you also need access to your private key to be able to sign a new transaction. Running a node probably enables you to do this.
When you got support on the forum, I think he actually looked it up in a blockchain explorer, and found that the confirmation was indeed already complete (included in at least one block). You can test this easily, e.g. at  . Add either the account number (public key) or the transaction ID. See typical example at 
Running your own node enables you to do this without having to trust any third party (i.e. the blockchain explorer). How important is this feature? In principle, very important. In practice, not very important as long as we are talking about small transactions with low risk of someone trying to scam you.
It is very difficult to trick a blockchain explorer. You either need to hack the web page, or (even harder) do a 51% attack with double spending (possibly costing multi millions of US$, maybe even billions).
If you are running an exchange, it is a very good idea to run your own node. You can be sure someone will try to fake a transaction and sell bitcoin before anyone finds out it wasn't a valid transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:47:27


I think that hit the nail on the head. The governance of a blockchain is different to anything else we have seen. It has some similarities to open source, but it is not that simple. While it is simple to clone an open source project and do something productive, forking a blockchain is something completely different.
The Nakamoto Consensus changes all this. In one way, the proper way to  determine exactly what the user want, is simply to hardfork and see what happens. While that is simple in theory, people are not used to it, exchanges are not use to it, and investors are not used to it. They all get very uncertain when there suddenly are two blockchains instead of one.
Eventually, I think that will have to change. It should be easy to hardfork, and it should come naturally. But it will require a complete re-think on the user side.

Not immediately, but with time. We all expect adoption to grow. If it does, fees should eventually be the same per transaction. This is the main assumption that leads to my other conclusions. Of course, this assumption can't be applied an unlimited number of times as there isn't an unlimited number of people in the world. But I think all agree adoption is at a very low level yet, with huge potential to increase.




The utility of doing transactions is the main utility of Bitcoin. Servicing twice the number of users would thus double the utility, which means the value of the blockchain is doubled. It doesn't translate into the price of one bitcoin being exactly doubled, though.

True, there is a 100 block delay. When BCH is super mined the way it is now, it corresponds to a delay of an hour. Not very much, and probably short enough to take the risk. The potential profits are considerable, and I think many miners willingly take this risk.

If we start with two chains at steady 10 min block time, and then one chain get an ever so small increase in profitability, every miner switch to that one. 2016 blocks will be produced  in one week. At that point, this chain will double in difficulty, and all miners will switch back to the other chain (which has had 0 blocks mined). After another week, this chain will have produced 2016 blocks (in a total of two weeks), and remain the more profitable one at the same difficulty. After another week, it will have produced another 2016 blocks, and the difficulty will double. At that point, both chains have similar difficulty, and it is random where the miners switch next. etc...

These fraudulent blocks and transactions will be dropped by the miner, anyway. And they are extremely unusual, so there is no real load change on the network.

The problem with the difficulty adjustments is that they are delayed 2016 blocks. That makes the system inherently unstable. That is a common attribute of both Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash. It is actually a weakness originating in the core Bitcoin. Sure, the developers behind Bitcoin Cash should have foreseen this, it was obvious.
The same may happen with SegWit2x unless someone does something.
The EDA emergency difficulty reduction isn't the root cause, although it makes the problem even worse.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:59:02
The root cause to the problem is the algorithm only updating difficulty every 2016 blocks. That is too slow.

The price will soon level out as it is now. Enabling more transactions will eventually be more profitable to the miners.
At first, the price per transaction will fall. But suppose adoption continues to grow. After a while, the fee per transaction will be back to the same again. At that point, the total fee will have increased.
Miners will profit from enabling of more transactions.

Yes, but it is kind of locally true for a small miner. If you double your hash rate every 4 year, you will be able to continue mining the same amount of bitcoin. At least as long as you remain a "small miner".

So, for the coffee example, I open a payment channel with the coffee shop. I suppose I need to add an amount exactly corresponding to the coffee initially to that payment channel?
Can I add more bitcoin next time I buy a coffee, to the same channel?
Take a new user of bitcoin. Suppose he buys a bitcoin at an exchange. Will the exchange use a payment channel to send that money to the user? I suppose the receiving user then has to close the channel to be able to use the money? (This would be case number 1 above).
Another example: For single transactions, we can expect exactly one blockchain transaction eventually? That is, the vendor will want to use the money for salaries or other costs some time.

That is provably more than bitcoin can currently handle.

The number of transactions peaked a while ago. The total fees also. Only way to increase fees now is to enable more transactions. Initially, the fees will go down as the "supply" goes up, but eventually demand (fees per byte) will be back to the same again. At that point, the profit from fees will approximately double if block size are doubled.
Try to convince miners this is not a good thing...
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:03:14


The profitability ratio between the two chains remains the same until 2016 blocks has been mined on one of them (or the price changes).


Double the hashing power leads to double rewards. No thinning here (until 2016 blocks have been mined, and the difficulty is updated).
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:13:18
Welcome to the world of altcoins. Miners have been switching around between various coins continuously now. That is the normal state, but bitcoin hasn't seen it until now because of being the only one with that specific POW. Miners are not there to push some ideology, they are there to make profits. The currency they get doesn't matter, but maximizing the profits does.

@_date: 2017-01-26 16:47:18


That seems unreasonable to me. If the fees per transaction is reduced by 50%, the volume (adoption) should increase.




No. If more effort is needed for hashing, hash rate will fall and difficulty will adjust.

Why should you run a node? There are a couple of reasons for it. If you mine (not using a pool), then it is obvious. If you are technically interested in how it works, it is also a good thing.
If you are just a hodler, buying pizza now and then, there is no reason to run a node of your own. It helps no one else, and it doesn't help you. Yes, you will be able to verify transaction without depending on a third party, but that isn't important if you just buy pizza. You can easily look it up in some of the blockchain explorers instead.
You do not speed up the network if you add a node. On the contrary, your node will add a load to the network while doing the downloading, and it will insert another hop, potentially delaying messages between other nodes.

If 90% switch now in the weekend, there will be something like one block every minute. It would take 33 hours until the next difficulty change, making BCH unprofitable to mine again. At that point, it is much more profitable to switch back to BTC mining. And so it continues, in an unstable cycle.
Unless the price changes has an effect, of course.
This would be some kind of worst case, which seems unreasonable.

From the perspective of a mining community, yes. But from a game theoretical perspective of individual miners, it is different. An individual anonymous miner that can make substantially more profits would see no problems switching for a while (other than ideological).

And that is the exact reason miners want bigger blocks. They will not get any profits from offchain transactions.  And that will take quite a while. Now is the chance they have to increase the block size, when there is still a demand for more transactions. 


That is exactly what is happening with BU.


You could be right, but I don't think so.
@_date: 2016-11-16 11:35:20
Yes, they are subsidized. When you send a transaction, the miners get a block reward that doesn't come from the user requesting the transaction.

But never more than what is covered by assets. Gold isn't the only asset.


No, they are not. Problem is when people withdraw money faster than the bank an liquidate other assets.
There are also problems if assets fall in value (e.g. customers failing to pay back loans). However, this is a problem even if there isn't a bank run.


There was no limit to what the **central bank** could create. It did not change for commercial banks.


For commercial banks, money is still supported by assets, it is just that the assets are not gold. E.g. it can be mortgage on real estate. For the central banks, the are still assets, even though they do not cover all the created money. You could say that the main asset is the confidence in the state. Certainly, this confidence has been violated frequently, especially in poorly developed countries.


That is because it has no purpose. The important thing is to have a controlled inflation (though how much inflation depends on who you ask).


Banks has a service they support, and they take risks. They get payed for these risks and the  services. Sure, I agree they make too much profits.

You missed the real reasons why miners want 2x blocks.
* Fees will fall initially. With growing adoption, blocks will eventually get full again. After a while, we will be back to the same equilibrium (fees per transaction). At this point, the rewards from transaction fees per block will be twice as high, compared to not implementing the 2x.
* With 2x, Bitcoin can service twice as many users. That means that Bitcoin, as a system, has doubled in value. This means the price of bitcoin should increase substantially. An increased price will benefit miners again.
A 2x has no problems for miners to manage (from the point of view of hard disk and network).

As always when there is a protocol upgrade, you must update your nodes, or there is a risk you will be left out. BitPay provides information on how to do that update. Referring to SW that isn't compatible with the agreement would be really bad.

I think something like 3 transactions per second is possible today. With SW, maybe we can support 5? That isn't enough to enable people to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions. This is making a lot of people unhappy, as they believed in the original vision of electronic cash for everyone. 
I don't know the time plans or details for the LN, but if it works as expected, it could support everyday transactions for everyone. 
Meanwhile, there is a debate whether to increase the blocksize limitation. There are limitations in the Bitcoin protocol that are problematic when the blocks get too big.
My personal opinion is that a small increase, e.g. to 2 or 4 MB, together with the SW would benefit everyone. It would help the adoption grow for a while longer, until other solutions become available.

This doesn't explain anything. The same type of argument can be used the other way.
If the price starts to fall, they need to sell more and more to cover costs, releasing more and more of the funds, causing the price to fall even further. 
Your argument is actually the same as The Greater Fool.

Taking away these coins from the current supply would decrease the supply. All other things equal, the price WILL go up.
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:06:40
It could be that miners prefer an increase in the blocksize, and blocks the SW as a way to show protest. Miners would benefit from a small increase, e.g. 2 to 8 times bigger, so they have an incentive. They will profit from the use of SW, but why stop at that when you can get more?
If the demand grows the same as such a blockchain size change, a factor 8 would give approximately 8 x 0.7 = 5.6 bitcoin per block. That would correspond to 44% increased profits.

I am assuming miners will have more than 90% consensus. That is what the signalling was about.


You can stay with one of the chains and never see any negative replay effects. It will continue to work just as it has always done. The only problem you get from replay is if you try to split your coins and use them on both chains.

I think this has been explained a lot if time, but here we go again:
With 1 MB blocks, adoption will reach a point where fees finds an equilibrium.
With a change to 2 MB blocks, everyone expects fees to initially fall from the previous equilibrium point. How much is unknown, but doesn't matter. 
After that, everyone expects adoption to grow with time. With growing adoption, blocks will start getting full again, and fees will go up again. Eventually, they will reach approximately the same equilibrium. At that point, miners will have doubled the revenue from transaction fees. This is a strong objective for miners to go through the 2x fork (given that it succeeds achieving the majority).
At that point, Bitcoin will service twice as many users as today. Effectively, the value of Bitcoin as a system will have doubled. That is why the change is also attractive to bitcoin holders.

Satoshi Nakamoto created something extraordinary. But I think his background is from the theoretical side, not as a sw engineer. There is no way a professional sw engineer would not begin with a formal sw specification based on the white paper. E.g. unit tests become meaningless without it.

The reader was asked to select one of two options. If it is the case that exactly one of these options is true, then most people would probably select b (Circle won't be used in 5-10 years). From that conclusion, the general question whether Circle will be used in 5-10 years, has the logical conclusion of "no".
However, there are more options than either a or b being true. They can both be true, or both be false. If that is possible, the general question of Circle in 5-10 years may not have the same answer.
This is a school example of the usage of a false dichotomy. I don't know why it was done, probably it is to try to discredit the business of Circle.

This is a known problem for all news. They have to make profits somehow, and people usually refuse to pay for reading articles. Just see how angry comments are about pay walls. One solution is to use ads to pay for the content, but I really don't like it. They litter the web page really badly, and you sometimes have to click through several "next page", just to force you to start the process again. The "war" between ads and ad blockers is interesting. It will probably consume huge amounts of money, if it isn't already.
I think some kind of micro transaction would be the best solution. Many have tried, but not succeeded. It could have been a killer app for Bitcoin even.

We all expect the blocks to be full eventually, and maybe really soon. At that point, fees will be back to the high levels again.

There is a problem, because Bitcoin gets bad reputation. Just see how many investors today avoid using the name "Bitcoin", and instead use "blockchain technology".
I think the current way to select a winner is good. It seems it is rather safe from the point of view of users of bitcoin. Newspaper misunderstanding can however, in worst case, lead to the conclusion that also the blockchain is flawed.
It all boils down to the "decentralized" meme, which means there is no organization in control. This is interpreted, by some, as a weakness as "no one" is in control. But used in the right way, it will instead be a strength. It is a paradigm shift, and it will take time until news reporters understand it.

I think you are wrong here. The mistake you do, is to suppose I will put the money in my wallet, and let time pass. In practice, everyone will either buy something else, in which case it doesn't matter if the money is inflationary, or they will invest it into something that will compensate for inflation.

On the other hand, it is a new paradigm on how to control SW. As Bitcoin is decentralized by design, there also need to be some kind of mechanism to introduce changes. Using the current way to fork is one way to do it.

There are no investments in bitcoin (the currency) if you summarize them all. It is a zero-sum game. That is, if I buy bitcoin for $1000, someone else will sell bitcoin for $1000. The total sum of investment change is zero.
Another example to show this is that it could reach the value of $100,000 simply if there would be fewer that want to sell.

The value of something is determined by the relation between supply and demand. For dollars, one indisputable demand is to pay taxes in the USA. The supply depends on politics, which is regarded as volatile by many.
The supply of bitcoins is well known, however. No politics can change this. In this case, it is the demand that is hard to predict.
If both demand and supply would have been known exactly, it would be possible to compute the price exactly. Both bitcoins and dollars have uncertainties (in demand respectively supply).
Stating that bitcoin has no intrinsic value is meaningless. Stating that it has no intrinsic value for anyone is simply wrong. I think this is where Krugman goes wrong.

I think that is still too complicated. Cheap and instant is the obvious choice. But how should non tech people be able to assess the security?

Whether the Classic team is doing this right or wrong, I don't have enough knowledge, so I have no opinion. I just try to understand what a hard fork means.


By definition, less than 25% (approximately) of the miners will remain with the old consensus rules if Classic "wins". Why would a minority of the miners stay on the old chain? The whole idea of "longest chain" principle is that there is an incentive to follow the longest chain.
I suppose miners could stay on the old chain for political reasons. But that would be a high risk. They are there to make money from mining. Their goal is to maximize profit. Staying on the old chain would be a high risk. Because of that, I believe 100% of the miners are going to switch at the exact time a hard fork happens, and not one block later.
@_date: 2016-02-14 21:23:35
If block size isn't increased, a growing volume of transactions eventually have to be done offchain instead of onchain. If I understand it correctly, LN depends on centralized support?

There is no reason for denying a 100% increase in transactions, 2 MB isn't a problem for anyone. There will be problems somewhere for even bigger blocks, but that still isn't an argument to stop 2MB.

There is a concept of "gas", where you have to pay for computation. If you do this "attack", miners will get very happy as they get a lot of fees.
If the gas price is wrong, which seems to be the case, it is indeed problematic. But it is not fatal for Ethereum. Either the EVM need to be fixed so as to make actual execution cost match the gas price ( [which has already been done]( ), or a hardfork is needed to adjust the gas price.

@_date: 2016-09-26 18:26:12
If you mine 10% of all the blocks, and is the one doing the attack, you would get 10% of all the fees back. That would indeed mitigate the cost of the attack. But I find it unlikely.

Please explain how you arrive to that number. As I understand it, there won't be a switch until at least 75% of the mined blocks accept the new block size. That means at most 25% of the miners will remain on the old protocol.
Your use of "alt coin" is probably not the common one when we are talking about a hard fork where all outputs before the hard fork remain intact. It is a derogative term that will weaken your arguments to some readers.

There is a trend in some fundamental religious circles to base the country laws on religion. But in general, I do agree.
Notice that most developed countries have a central bank semi independent of the state. I think it is a good principle, and the state should try to balance the budget without having any support from the central bank.

But on the other hand, the value of bitcoin depends on the utility. And the utility goes up if number of transactions goes up. I think this effect is bigger, but I can't prove it.
Increasing blocksize will lower the transaction price. That should mostly have an effect on smaller transactions.

The key thing here is that money created by a bank can only be used internally. That is, if you buy a car from someone that deposits the payment on an account in the same bank. Of course, many transactions will in practice go to other banks. That works as long as the outflow is of a similar size as the inflow.
This is the reason a bank run is problematic. If people withdraws 10% of the total bank credits, without paying back on loans, all assets in the bank will be gone.

There is also the problem of hash power. If the total hash power of the new coin is too low, the new blockchain will not be secure. To get good hash power, you need good miner rewards. To get good rewards, you need the network affect with many users.
Good luck.

Exactly, velocity of money if very important when trying to estimate the market cap of bitcoin. The interesting thing is that bitcoin has a very high velocity. E.g. some vendors immediately change back to fiat for every item they sell. There is also discussions about a similar possibility for customers, where they "use fiat", which is transparently changed to bitcoin. This will even further increase the velocity as they don't have to "sit on" any bitcoin.

Suppose I am a consumer. I want to buy a TV set, which has a built-in automated payment for some service I wish to use. There are two different options to chose from: One TV set that mines bitcoin automatically, and one where I have to manually transfer bitcoin to.
If the first option is more expensive, I am going to go for the second one. And the first example can't be used for a while. When I plug it in, it will need some time to mine before I can start using it.
Suppose the first option runs out of bitcoins. It simply doesn't mine enough to pay for the service I want. I would need to manually transfer bitcoin to it, and we have the same drawbacks as the second option.

Why would the bank lend its own money to someone? It wouldn't get interest for it, because you just explained that you have to pay a fee if you want to deposit your money at someone else.

They added something new.


I can prove it. To be able to do something new with this unit, there has to be something that is different. To analyze this, I made a list of what you get:
1. A general computing unit.
2. Network support.
3. A mining chip.
4. A Bitcoin address.
5. The unit has access to the private key for this Bitcoin address.
It is important to understand that there are no bitcoin "on the unit". However, the unit knows the private key that enables it control the Bitcoin address.
The new thing here is item 3, a mining chip. The rest is common technology, e.g. a Raspberry Pi. So the only difference to a common Raspberry Pi is that it can convert electricity to bitcoin, to the address in item 4. There are two ways to get bitcoin to this address. Either use the built-in mining chip, or send it through a transaction. There is a cost associated with using the internal chip (initial price plus electricity), and there is of course a cost when doing a transaction (cost for the bitcoin plus transaction cost).
This means that the only difference between a standard Raspberry Pi and this unit is the cost to get the bitcoin. That means the unit is only interesting if it an provide a lower cost compared to doing a manual transaction. If it can, then you are better off using these mining chips in a mining rig, and the IoT units no longer need the mining chip. If the unit can produce bitcoin for a higher cost than the transfer method, then you will save money if you use a standard Raspberry P and transfer bitcoin on your own to the address.


Problem is, no one has shown any idea what you can do with this unit that you can't do with a standard Raspberry Pi. The difference is how the bitcoin are allocated.
@_date: 2015-09-24 19:13:59


You can do the same thing with a standard Pi. The only difference is the price. That means you can't claim the price doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 19:09:35
You analogy is not good. What we say is that you can get **exactly** the same result, but cheaper without using a mining chip.
@_date: 2015-09-12 06:21:29
I think the theory "Velocity of money" can help explain. Suppose Bitcoin is needed to transfer 1 billion USD/day. If a transaction takes 24 hours, a market cap of bitcoin of 1 billion USD is required. But a more realistic transfer time is 6 confirmations, about 1 hour. If so, a market cap of 1/24=42 million USD is needed to support that transaction volume.
As many vendors immediately get fiat for all trades, it will keep the "velocity" up. Counteracting this are hoarders and speculators, which will slow down the velocity.
If the efficiency of Bitcoin improves (shorter confirmation times used), given the same transaction volume, the counterintuitive result is that the price will fall. Many journalists don't understand this. They regard a falling price as a sign of weakness.
I think the velocity of money from the point of view of Visa is much slower. Several days can be needed for a complete confirmation. Velocity of cash is also slow. It mostly sits inactive in a wallet.
Tl;Dr Incisively, a falling price may indicate success.
@_date: 2015-09-24 05:19:26


It is probably cheaper to simply transfer bitcoin to the address controlled by the platform, than having it mining on its own. If so, the whole idea with a mining chip is wasted.

Please explain, I honestly don't understand. They are adding a mining chip. Name anything you can use this for?

There is a simple solution: Don't sell any coins from the minority chain. If you don't do that, you will not risk anything. There are a couple of scenarios:
1. The minority chain dies out eventually. That means all market cap returns to the majority chain, and your bitcoin retain their value.
2. The majority chain is overtaken, and dies out. The same result as 1, as you still have the minority coins.
3. The minority chain stabilizes after some time, and shows vital signs of continuing as a minority chain indefinitely. If so, you can eventually sell you minority coins and get your full money back.
The only risk is if you want to speculate and gain profits from the fork. You make an educated guess that one of the chains are going to change in proportion to the other, and can thus sell the "other" coins. But that is speculation, and you take the risk if you want to.
@_date: 2015-09-25 08:47:57
GDP is an amount of money transactions. It is not an amount of money located somewhere. It is theoretically possible to have the market cap of bitcoin at $1, and still support 7.5 trillion dollar. You just have to do 7.5 trillion transactions at $1 each.
It is all a question of velocity of money. You can't divide 7.5 trillion with the number of bitcoins and get a value of one bitcoin that way.
@_date: 2015-09-06 00:04:36


What do you mean by "they have"?
To keep it simple, a bank has two kinds of money. The first kind is its own money. This was given by the owners. I think it is this money you mean.
Then there is money from deposits from customers. Lending this money to others is what will create FRB. Suppose we forbid that. That means the bank can't use deposits from customers to anything. That means the bank will not pay any interest for it. It will probably have to charge a fee for the service. The result is that people can no longer get an interest for their savings.
You will probably need to forbid the stock market also, because it is in practice just another way to lend money to someone and get interest for it.

I understand that. Notice that, when you compare these two to each other, the cost of an attack may be higher in POS than in POW, measured in US$.
@_date: 2016-10-01 14:26:37
I think I see what you mean. If there is a hardfork in a POS system, there is no problem of what the miners will do. You don't need to worry about miners choosing sides.
I think the experiences from Ethereum HF shows the same goes for a HF in a POW system. It is the users that decide. If there are users, there will be a value on the token. IF there is a value on the token, there will be an incentive to mine the new chain. Miners are just hired workers. They get payed to do a job, and do not have much to say.
For Bitcoin, it gets complicated. One reason is that it takes over 2000 blocks to change difficulty. That means a fork can become non functional very quickly.
@_date: 2015-09-13 14:19:20
This is one of the brilliant features of Bitcoin. When you get a bank account, obviously someone has to make sure you get a unique number. That requires a central organization, which we don't have on Bitcoin. Instead, the idea is to create the address on your own, based on a random number.
You can create 1 billion of these, nobody will notice any of them on the blockchain until you transfer money to it.
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:13:56


If it isn't profitable, it means there are cheaper ways to get the same thing done. In this case, it is probably cheaper to buy the bitcoin and send them to the IoT that you want to fund.


Exactly. If there are cheaper ways to do it, the other ways will be used instead.
@_date: 2016-10-15 23:11:35
No one trust the miners. You are not supposed to, a blockchain is trustless. The only thing you trust is that they will do what they can to maximize their profits. The trick is to formulate the incentives for the miners in such a way that maximizing their profits will also maximize the utility for the users.
That is what turned out to be wrong in Ethereum. Miners can sometimes make higher profits mining empty blocks, which requires a hardfork to fix.
Incidentally, some bitcoin miners also mines empty blocks now and then.

Only 10% of the gold is actually used industrially. The use of gold in jewelry is a side of effect of gold having high value. E.g. some plastics shines much better than real gold. If gold wouldn't have had high value, it probably wouldn't have been used as much in jewelry.

Given your assumptions, nothing can stop them.
ETC is POW based. The attackers will have to spend electricity to do the attack, but can then go back mining elsewhere.
Now suppose ETC changes to POS. This time, attackers can buy enough etc to do an attack. Maybe they need 30% of all etc to do this (I don't know the exact number). As a result of the attack, they will lose the stake. Compare this with a POW attack, where you only lose the electricity. 
And such an attack on a POS system would probably fail anyway, as it will be detected and can be ignored (although this probably requires a hf).

Fractional Reserve Banking is possible with bitcoin also. That means there can be just as much inflation as with fiat.
The limited number of tps will encourage the use off offchain transactions, which leads to frb.
Example: A bank trading with bitcoin creates an IOU note for a 5 bitcoin, and lends them out to someone. According to the definition, they have now created money, in this case 5 bitcoin. These 5 bitcoin do not need to be on the blockchain to included in the definition of money.
@_date: 2016-10-01 11:28:41
You are certainly right. But, an attack on a system that isn't worth anything will not give you any rewards.
There is exactly the same problem with POW. A low valuation will give low rewards from mining, which means the hash power will be low.
POS have higher incentives for block validators (miners) to behave correctly than POW. If you cheat as a POS miner, you lose your investment (the stake). If you cheat as a POW miner, you don't lose your investment (the mining equipment).
@_date: 2016-10-15 23:30:21
Yes, I haven't looked at the incentives for dynamic block size limits. If done wrong, it could indeed lead to decreased utility for the users.
@_date: 2016-10-22 14:54:40
There is always the case of Tragedy Of The Commons. If there is such strategy possible, and the miner doing this making more profit than others, then it will happen.
You must never trust miners to do anything but maximizing their profits. The incentives must bu such that this maximization leads to exactly what the user of Bitcoin want.
See for example what happened in Ethereum during the spam attacks. It turned out to be too expensive to include transactions, so miners started to mine empty blocks and ignore the mempool.

Actually, there was a fork in the community already before the hardfork. The hf was then used to separate users. From that point of view, the hf was a success.

It worries me a little. I own some bitcoin, so I don't mind if the value goes up. But going up too fast eventually leads to a correction. And something most agree on is that high volatility isn't good. That adds risk, and will prevent "normal business" from keeping a bitcoin position.
Looking at charts for number of transactions per day, they are increasing continuously, but not at all as quickly as the price. So I think a big reason for the current rally is driven by speculation.

Suppose I want to take a loan for buying a car. I go the bank, signs up for a loan, and I get an IOU for 10,000 $. I take this IOU to a car dealer, buys a car with it. The car dealer now goes back to the same bank and deposits the IOU.


Agreed, but this is just as it works today. The question is if you trust the IOU, just as today. The IOU will probably not be in the form of a paper note, but instead be something a third party service will support. Something like VISA.

When publishing essays like this, it can be a good idea to provide a summary and separate the text into named contents. Some effort is required from the reader to walk through it all, and there is a high risk people will give it up if they don't know better what to expect.

Very good explanation. I see this misconception all the time.
Maybe there is one difference. The required number of dollars to move the price from 1300 to 1400 is astronomically higher than moving the price from 13 to 14. That means the general interest in Bitcoin has grown exponentially.

But high volatility is exactly the reason Bitcoin adoption isn't growing as fast as it otherwise would. Many vendors that accepting bitcoin use a service to immediately change into a fiat currency. That means they don't use bitcoin to pay for their own costs, and this breaks the "full circle" that we want to happen.

The real voting power is the price a bitcoin has in a case of a fork. Maybe you are a whale with considerable resources, I don't know. If that is the case, you will actually be able to vote. That is, if you sell and buy, you will move the price. The price is what will pay the miners, and so it will indirectly control the hash power.
If you are just a "coin holder" or only using bitcoin transactions on a small scale to pay for things, your node will change nothing whatsoever, except for yourself. It will have no effect on anyone else.

@_date: 2016-10-27 15:53:56


There was a lot of good arguments in this thread, but this one is wrong.
That is, the effect "too small for it to become a true global currency" doesn't lead to the conclusion that going from 1 to 2 MB makes no difference.
1. To begin with, I  don't think anyone see the possibility of Bitcoin reaching the status of a global currency, at least not on-chain. It is not what all the arguments are about.
2. If increasing the blocksize is wrong, then decreasing the blocksize has to be right.
3. Increasing the blocksize from 1 to 2 MB will enable twice as many transactions as today. That is a 100% improvement. Because of the network effect, the value of Bitcoin can possible grow by more than 100% from that. Calling this "absolutely no difference" is wrong.

There is a simple explanation that may explain the increase in value. Looking at the [Estimated USD Transaction Volumne]( you will find that it has increased a lot recently. To be able to do that, bitcoin need a higher value.
I don't claim this is the perfect explanation, as much depends on estimations. But it is a possible explanation. One thing that can contradict this conclusion is that the historical correlation is low. But I think the historical price movements were mostly driven by speculation (and possibly manipulation), while the price at low $200 is closer to a fundamental value. If so, increased usage should immediately be reflected in increased price.

Good article. There is one thing missing, and that is the incentive to double the block size. If the block size is doubled, it will enable twice as many transactions. That will double the utility, and thus the value of Bitcoin (the blockchain). This may significantly increase the price of bitcoin.
A higher price for bitcoin, and more transaction fees (eventually with increased adoption) will be a double win for miners. I don't think the miners really want to take away control from core, they simply want more revenue. But core wants to scale offchain, which will not benefit the miners.
Doubling the number of transactions will also be a win for the users, making it a win-win.

The supply of bitcoin is not only from mining. Depending on price there will be a supply from other owners. This is easy to understand if you take things to the extreme. E.g. suppose mining would provide no new bitcoin. The price would not go to the infinite.

If you get more profit, it is a strong incitament. On a short term, fees per transaction will go down as there is less competition for block space. I think most people expect adoption to grow, however. Eventually, 2 MB blocks should start to get filled, and fees will start climbing again.
There are also second order effects. An increased number of transactions increases the utility of Bitcoin, which should be reflected in a higher valuation. This will also increase mining profits.

There are a lot of goodies in this interview. I tried to write some of it down from the first 30 minutes. Please add correction if I misunderstood something, or simply got it wrong.
SegWit addresses the following
1. Transaction Malleability
2. Quadratic hashing
3. Blocks are no longer measured as “block size”, but as a “block weight”.
4. Script version number. This opens up the door for much more innovations in the Bitcoin scripting language. The previous method was to use undefined opcodes or opcodes that did nothing.
It also enables a new kind of node: A fully validated copy of the blockchain without the signatures.
SegWit really is a prerequisite for any advanced feature that can be built on Bitcoin, not just second layer solutions. It will enable Schnorr signatures (which reduce the space signatures take quite significantly) which depends on being able to update the script versioning.
11:30 Spam: What is one person's garbage data is another person’s viable application. There are two ways to decide what is what. One is to assign an authority: someone decides what is spam. If developers get the authority to decide this, it gives them a lot of power. The other way is to use the market. You basically say that there is no such thing as spam. There are two types of transactions: One where the issuer believes the transaction is worth the fee, and one where the issuer does not believe it is worth the fee at the current capacity. And then let the market do a price discovery on what is and isn’t viable to carry. You either make decisions with the market, or you you make decisions with authorities.
13:10 SegWit is an architectural change:
1. How transactions are constructed
2. How they are propagated
3. How they are stored
It is a fairly complex change to the architecture. It is important enough to be worth doing. There is absolutely no security difference between a transaction that contains witness inputs or outputs, and a transaction that doesn’t.
18:10 SegWit2x: There is no effective way to force the two parts to be tied together (SegWit + block size increase). SegWit2x is a technical plan wrapped in a governance plan. The governance part says that 80% of us have committed plus some part of the economic activity. It seems it is quite a big part of the economic activity has committed to this roadmap. The same governance model can be implemented in both Core and BTC1. But the only thing that keeps the alliance together is the commitment to that roadmap. The BTC1 repository is the reference implementation, but presumably you may see the same thing implemented by Core.
Is Bitcoin done with hardforks: No.
27:45 SegWit delivers an immediate increase of the block weight to 2 MB, which basically means you can now fit twice as many transactions as long as some of them are transaction spending SegWit scripts (are spending outputs that are SegWit ready). SegWit might give us less in a bytes for bytes scenario if you look at it from a perspective of a block. But that is only if you assume that all nodes will store all things and validate all things as if the only thing that changed was the size. But a simple block size increase would lose out of the ability (listed with SegWit changes) and to have a fully validated node without having to keep the signatures once they are validated, which would allow people to run full nodes on a much smaller footprint. That is a significant change in the economics and the resource requirements running a node. Comparing SegWit with a block size increase byte for byte efficiency isn’t possible. It depends on whether you mean bytes stored or transmitted. I think the benefit across the network will be much better with SegWit than a 2x blocksize increase. The problem is that signatures are used to validate the transactions, but then no longer used. But they are still stored, and use approximately 75% of the storage.
35:20 Should SegWit be implemented as a hardfork instead of a softfork? The idea is for a softfork now, and also a hardfork later on. The really best way to introduce SegWit is to change the architecture of the block header. Right now, the block header has limited space. The header structure has proven to be insufficient to the broader needs of the system. But the change of the block header is a pretty big overhaul. The argument that SegWit is too complex change and a hardfork should be used instead, is problematic as it would also include the big header overhaul. When it was discovered that SegWit could be implemented as a softwork, it brought the time table forward.

If there is a lock in, which seems to be happening now (or at least in the next period of 336 blocks), then it means there is a broad miner consensus for SegWit2x. That means that we will get SegWit, and no chain split in the near future.
SegWit2x also means that the miners say that they agree to a change to 2MB blocks in three months. That will be the next step where there is a risk for a chain split depending on how it actually plays out.
If miners aren't on the same chain, there will effectively be two blockchains. You will have two sets of bitcoin, but it doesn't make you twice as rich as they aren't interchangeable. Such an event can be bad for Bitcoin, and adds a lot of user confusion problems (how to handle the two sets).
Blockchains are a new type of data structure. It is controlled by consensus as their isn't any central authority. And it has to be that way, or they would be vulnerable to external attacks. The disadvantage of not having a central authority is that it can be difficult to follow what changes users really want. Is it changes from the most vocal users, or is it changes from the users that actually use the blockchain?
Some people argue that allowing the blockchain to fork is the best solution. That way, you will eventually see what chain is the winning one, which should (hopefully) represent the users best. There are blockchains that have gone through this process, but Bitcoin has been mostly spared from it. That is one reason why a lot of actors are very uncomfortable with the process.

Blocks signalling for the SegWit2x, i.e. the New York Agreement segwit activation (BIP91), are setting bit4. This shows up as a '1' in the second to last position of the version field. Blocks signalling readiness for BIP141, i.e. regular segwit activation, do so on bit1 which shows up as '2' in the last position of the version field.
That is, you are signalling for SegWit2x. The core client doesn't do this, but the BTC1 client does.

What I am highlighting here, is that there is a discrepancy. In the case of a non controversial hardfork (a.k.a a protocol upgrade), the new coin will replace the old.
In the case of a minor hostile fork, the new coin is lost. 
That means that exchanges have to publicly state in advance which fork they will follow. Which in turn means they have to decide before the economic majority has nominated the winner.

This is a standard rhetoric trick of "False dilemma". If Segwit2x is accepted, you want us to expect other changes, e.g. change of issuance. In reality, a change of issuance has almost no support.


For whatever reason, the developers failed to deliver scalability solutions that satisfy a set of people. Because of that, this set of people now presents their own next step.


This is pure speculation (commonly called FUD). If a clear economic majority follows segwit2x, the status of Bitcoin may be improved.


No, they can't. The economic majority will not allow that. Why would they? Notice, the miners are not the economic majority, it is the real users.
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:22:50
The miners signalling for Segwit2x want bigger blocks. But they had to compromise, and accept SegWit also. There is no reason for them to give up the 2x part now, that it received a super majority. That is, we know at least 80% of the miners want the 2x.

This is rather embarrassing. 


increases the overall value of the currency
So actually, it is the price level of goods, as measured in bitcoin, that has this relationship. Which means the conclusion is exactly backward. 
In my opinion, the Velocity Of Money is an important tool when analyzing currencies. It is much more relevant than the Market Cap. It gets really interesting when you compare ETH with bitcoin. For ETH, money will be locked away in contracts, which will effectively slow down the velocity compared to bitcoin. Of course, coin holders also slow down velocity. The result is that ETH should have a different valuation than bitcoin. Comparing the market caps between these currencies simply isn't relevant. 
Velocity is likewise a major obvious difference between gold and bitcoin. The effect is that the total value of bitcoin probably never will reach the total value of gold.

When measuring the utility of Bitcoin, I mean people using it for p2p payments. How much is the Bitcoin system worth for these people, in total? 


Yes, but that is not a cost that is paid by the users. So it has no effect on the utility (as defined above).


Agreed. But one solution being good doesn't have to mean that other solutions are not good. Scalability is a complicated issue, which will require many steps.
Notice that there already are offchain solutions. E.g. when paying through Coinbase, you have the option to use an account at Coinbase instead of a real transaction. This can probably scale quite high, but has the disadvantage that it is centralized. A little too close to the old banking for many users.


Let's take two extreme cases. A doubling of the block size accompanied by exactly a doubling of number of users. That would, according to my definition, be exactly a doubling of the utility. This example has a linear growth of utility. 
Another extreme case is a doubling of a block size but no change in number of users. That is, all current users can now double the number of transactions they do. In this case, the utility per user will not double, as there is a diminishing return. This example has a sub-linear growth of utility.
In reality, we are going to end up somewhere in between. The day of the change of the block size, adoption will not immediately jump, and utility will mostly tend to the second case. With time, and growing adoption, there will eventually come a point where the level of the fees are back to the same as before the change. At this point, the average number of transactions per user will be back to the same, as it is the same equilibrium. But that means that the number of users has doubled, and we now have case one. If adoption continues to grow, we eventually ends up with a doubling of the utility.

Halving of the mining reward doesn't have to correspond to a halving of the hash power.
Suppose that the rewards goes below the cost of current for miners. Then these miners will either shut down or operate at a loss. They would be better of shutting down. 
If the costs of mining, excluding investments in hw, is less than the rewards for all miners, then there will be no hashing change on the day of the halving.

Yes, just a little. It has been planned for and expected for 8 years.


Bitcoin is trustless. If you say we can't trust miners, Bitcoin is a failed project. But I don't agree. The incentives has to be configured in such a way that miners maximizing their profit will maximize the utility for the users.

In a way, this is somewhat misleading. Take the example of the Ethereum fork into ETH and ETC. You got your ETH back from Coinbase, which was not of the original type. (Eventually, you also got ETC back I believe).
So it is up to Coinbase to declare what fork they are going to follow. I think this is a difficult situation, and the exchanges don't have a good general way to handle it.
The same goes for Poloniex, which also guarantees the "original type" when you lend bitcoin. Whatever that is.

There is no 50% threshold for nodes.

Please explain what this risk is, and how it depends on interest rates. Examples:
Suppose there is deflation. Interest rate is negative (and prices are falling). You will then probably be forced to pay the bank to manage your money. But the value of your money stays the same because of the falling prices.
The opposite case, which is more common, is a state of inflation. You will now get an interest rate that will compensate you for the increasing prices.
In the end, people usually don't keep large amounts of cach at home, and they don't keep large amount of money on the bank account. If you have that "problem", you will invest it somewhere, which will (depending on risk) protect against inflation and deflation.

On the contrary. Miners don't need SegWit, which makes it easier to implement offchain transactions. However, miners need bigger blocks, as that enables more transactions and eventually higher total fees. So the SegWit was a compromise to get the 2x. You can be sure they will push hard for the second step.

Actually, it is already happening. E.g. in Sweden there there is now a service called Swish that support free immediate transfers. It has quickly become very popular. They now plan to extend it for use with vendors. 
With the caveat that they may add fees eventually, foreign transfers isn't supported, and commercial users probably are not supported. As always, there is no free lunch, but I haven't seen the price yet.

We all have some idea what Bitcoin should be used for. I don't say I like the outcome you use as an example, but it would be one case of success. 
There is such a scenario in Ethereum. The definitely most successful use case is as tokens for crowdfunding. Some even call it the first killer app. But it was not what was envisioned originally, and there are critics that say it is wrong.
To some extent, it is possible to adjust the fees so as control what you can do.

There are a couple of factors that determine the price from a demand point of view:
1. The utility of bitcoin to do transactions 
2. The use to store value
3. Pure speculation 
Suppose only  and  stays constant. How the do we expect  to change? Given that we are almost at the limit on number of transactions,  the utility can't increase any more.
The coming halving will affect the supply, however. But I don't think it is a big change. More important, on the short term, is probably speculation (which probably is not going to stay constant). If so, any drastic price increase will be followed by a return to a similar level as today.

The chain tech has already been copied widely, each of them using using something other than the bitcoin currency. However, they are currently small in comparison. For something to replace Bitcoin, it has to add a significant advantage, not just smaller improvements. That is usually called the network effect, where the best solution is the one that is mostly used, not the one that is technically superior.
Some banks and finance organizations are looking into using [private blockchains]( which will not be based on the bitcoin currency. They can be seen as giving some advantages to distributed databases (follow the link for some analysis). I think some will succeed, but I don't think they will compete with Bitcoin.

Instead of simply rejecting the statement, please explain how you see the utility of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-07-05 17:16:05
For bitcoin to increase in price, the demand needs to go up or the supply to go down. The halving will ensure that supply goes down, but it is difficult to compute in advance what that means for the price. It depends on how much of the ether on exchanges are coming from mining.
The demand for bitcoin depends on the utility. Higher utility, and the demand goes up. So the question then is what is utility? I think there are two main areas; using bitcoin as a store of value, and using bitcoin to transfer money.
The attribute to work as a store of value depends on volatility. High volatility means higher risk, which means less appropriate as a store of value. Speculators sometimes like high volatility, but that is not a utility. So I don't think bitcoin as a store of value will improve in the near future.
Using bitcoin for transferring money is probably the main utility. We are at a limit today, but the SegWit should allow for an increase. [One estimate]( seems to indicate 1.6 to 2 times as many transactions as today. If this is correct, when SW is fully utilized, the utility of bitcoin can almost double. If the current price is "correct", then a 100% increase seems to be the limit what is possible.

@_date: 2017-05-29 20:46:58
If you spend any output that was available before the chain split, the transaction will be replayed on both chains. So there are no SegWit addresses to begin with.
The only way to have a transaction that is only valid on one of the chains, is if it includes output from a block reward on that chain.
This problem will persist for all future, but newly minted coins will gradually spread and mix with other unspent output. If the situation persists, the only solution is a hardfork that makes the chains incompatible.

But that was not what the argument was about. I am disputing that Bitcoin is dept-free money. Depending on definition, you could say it is "not dept-based" the way fiat money is. But bankers can still create bitcoins as debt, "out of thin air", as I explained in my example.
It is fully possible that, in the future, the total money (as measured in Bitcoin) can be 10 x 21 millions. Of course, you will never find more than 21 millions on the blockchain, but money is usually defined as including the total amount of credits (e.g. M3).
@_date: 2016-07-11 02:10:15
To get that, either pure speculation is needed, or the utility of bitcoin need to increase. I am not sure how that is going to happen, as the number of transactions are practically maximized.
SegWit should improve the situation somewhat?
Increased speculation increases the volatility, which is only good for day traders.

There are a lot of stories about people doing the same mistake. One way to assess the choice you did, is to see if there is a lesson to be learned from it. To avoid doing the same mistake again. 
But I don't think so. It may be that the price on bitcoin goes up a factor of ten in a few years, but it is uncertain. The value of bitcoin mostly depends on its utility, which is mainly the ability to transfer money. This is near a maximum now, although there plans to address the scalability.

There are some problems with this statement.
* There are enough rewards already for at least 4 years, and probably even longer. Thus, the fees are not needed to increase today to make profit for the miners.
* There is a limit where people will no longer want to pay more for transactions, and the growth will be halted. It might be better to use the current subsidizing to further encourage adoption, possibly an order of magnitude. Then, after that, let the fees increase. That will eventually make an order of magnitude more profits for the miners, and secure the network.

Look it up in [wikipedia]( Notice how the demand curves are falling with price.
One example: Suppose price doubles. Buyers can now only buy half as many bitcoin, and so the demand has fallen by 50%.
Another example: If price goes up, a higher proportion may now think the bitcoin is overpriced, and stay away from buying. Thus, demand falls.
If demand would have gone up with price, you would get an unstable self referencing infinite increase. To reach an equilibrium, the supply curve and demand curve has to  cross each other.
There is the secondary effect I mentioned, which is usually called a "shift in demand". This results from pure speculation, and is very volatile. Adoption of bitcoin (actually using it) does not really depend on the price, as long as the price is high enough to support the transactions.

I only know how it works in Sweden, but I suppose it is similar elsewhere. There is a requirement that banks must have a minimum liquidity and a maximum liquidity. They achieve that by borrowing from, or lending to the central bank.

It seems to be a common practice to fire up nodes just to "support the network" or to vote for something. These nodes have no users, unless you also actually use your node for transactions. These nodes are useless. 


I didn't recommend anyone to store their bitcoin on an exchange. I recommended exchanges to run their own nodes.


True, the slowdown may be small. But adding nodes doesn't help anything (unless, of course, it is used for something).


So, the still open question is, will nodes without users or mining help the network in any way? I can't see how.

The banker is the one taking the risk, which has a cost. Also important is the future value of money.
If we would know there is no risk, and would know the exact fv of the money, no banker would be needed. The process could be entirely automated. But that is rarely the case.
I think the banks have it too easy making profits. Most of it, they do from things we would rather circumvent. This is where Bitcoin will shine. But we are still going to need to borrow money, so we won't get rid of Fractional Reserve Money mechanisms.

A caveat: running a node with no mining and no users helps no one. It just slows down the network, even if it is minimal.

Tokens with no intrinsic value are rather meaningless. They only serve to prove that you participated in something. E.g. for some other blockchain you can get one "Unicorn" token for  every 2.4 ether you donate.
Of all the ICO tokens I have looked into, most have served some purpose, and thus have some intrinsic value (utility).
If there is no utility other than pure speculation, a buyer relies on a greater fool to be able to sell with profits. That is by definition a Ponzi scheme.

The higher the interest rate, the more incentive there is to save money. I think you got it backwards.
Example: Suppose you own a house, and have taken a loan for it. With higher interest rates, you get less money to spend every month, which has to be taken from a consumption. That means a higher interest lowers the speed of money. And vice versa.

The value of Bitcoin, the system, is the ability to do safe transactions. And some other services, like storing attached data (Proof Of Existence).
Indirectly, "safe" depends on difficulty, which depends on the  price of bitcoin, which depends on the utility, which again is transactions (and mostly future expected transaction capacity). If transactions is disregarded as a utility, Bitcoin will revert to a Ponzi Scheme.

Don't blame the central banks. They have a mission from the state to achieve an inflation at a specified level. One of the few ways a central bank have to increase the inflation when it is too low is to lower the interest rates.

Only the politicians can change this requirement.

The miner stake a high amount of money, which is locked in for 4 months. Then he bets on what block is to be considered "finalized". A bock with 2/3 of the bets (of the complete stake) is considered secure.
If you change your mind (try to rewrite), you lose your whole stake. Compared to POW, it is as if your whole mining farm burned down. And then, you need a majority of all stake to do the rewrite, so it will become prohibitively expensive.

I may have misunderstood your post, but I think you meant to say that vendors will be sorry if they decline to accept bitcoin, and it then turns out the price goes up a factor of 10.
As vendors usually keep very little of the bitcoin, if any, they will make no profit from an increased price.
Admittedly, a huge increase in adoption may be negative for vendors that stay behind.

It depends on what definition you use, and there are more than one. [Miriam-Webster]( has the following definitions:
* the money that a country uses : a specific kind of money
* something that is used as money

The second one is clearly matched by Bitcoin, and the third one to some degree. The first one is for fiat money.

You forgot the mining rewards. Newly minted coins leads to a significant downward pressure.
There are also speculators going short. They borrow bitcoin, sell them, and hope the price will fall. 
Finally, everyone is going to sell eventually, no matter what you here in these forums. Unless of course they die or throw away their keys. The time to sell varies from person to person. 


This is a common attribute with Ponzi Scheme.

Every node is connected to approx 8 other nodes. If you add a node there is a chance it will be inserted between nodes that actually do something. E.g. between two miners. If that happens, information propagation will slow down. To take an extreme example: Adding 8 times as many nodes as there are today, would on average add one extra hop for all traffic.


You don't need that. Miners will validate the transactions. It doesn't matter if another node does it or not. The important thing is that the miner does it, as they create the new blocks.


No, it adds nothing. It only slows down the network. Unless it has users, of course. E.g. an exchange is a user with a lot of traffic, they will have use of a node. And blockchain explorers also. But if you have no users and no mining, there is no use for it.

You will have the same problem, even if it is your own currency. If you manage to increase inflation to 50%, as an example, your current debts will obviously melt away quickly. However, taking new loans will force you to pay a rent that is higher than the inflation, which would be above 50% in this case.
The required interest rate will probably become even higher if the lenders suspect you are going to do the same trick again. Just the suspicion that a president plans to print the nation out of dept may incur an increase in interest rate. That is why it may be detrimental of Trump to claim he can print as much as needed, even if that wouldn't happen.

Why not? What is the problem with that? Or the proper question is probably, how will Bitcoin become vulnerable in such a scenario?
I suppose we are talking about exchanges, miners, light client support and various blockchain explorers? And other "heavy" users, e.g. institutions with a lot of on-chain trading.
If you want to ensure that any small computer shall be able to run a full node, you will cripple on-chain scalability. Most of these are passive nodes anyway, not helping the network.

Interesting thing is that the network effect from transactions grows by the square of the number of users, but the network effect for coin holders grows linear with the number of users (which is not a network effect really).

The same people often say that there is no intrinsic value. But this is mostly a meaningless name. Better is to use the concept of Utility. If something has a utility to someone, it also has a value to that person. In this case, it is the possibility of transactions that is the utility.

It is a good question, but there is a good answer! 
If you look at a dividend bearing asset, you can estimate a future price depending on the expected dividend per share and risk. Given such a price, you can estimate the market value of the company. It would be unreasonable to expect a market cap that is much higher or lower.
For a cryptocurrency, there are no dividends, and so you can't compute a reasonable market value in the same way.
Another example: suppose Bitcoin is only used for its ability to do transactions. The price per bitcoin need to be high enough to support the transaction demand. (E.g. a price of $1 per million bitcoin would not allow high transaction value throughput.) Now, if a coin holder starts buying up these bitcoin, the remaining bitcoin would increase in value correspondingly to continue supporting the transaction volume. When 50% of all bitcoin has been bought (taken out of circulation), the total value of the remaining bitcoin would still be the same as the original total value. In effect, the market cap would have doubled, and it will be impossible to buy all bitcoin. That is not the same dynamics shares in a company would have.
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:53:58

Using bitcoin as a store of value is certainly a use case. But bitcoin isn't a good store of value, as the volatility is high. That means the risk is high.
To invest in bitcoin is a speculation that the price will one day go up. Which again depends on the utility. Speculation in itself isn't a utility.

Current inflation in US is 2-2.5%. If you live in the US, your purchase power decrease by 2% per year. This is not considered a high inflation by most economists. This can change,of course, but that is what it is just now. I doubt 2% is enough an incentive to drive people into Bitcoin. Trading fees and transaction fees can eat up just more than one year of inflation. And then, Bitcoin is a poor store of value because of the high volatility.
@_date: 2017-06-18 03:22:46
