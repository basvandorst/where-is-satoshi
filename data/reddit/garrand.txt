That is a different question. Hyperinflation does not necessarily mean a collapse is imminent (although it would be extremely difficult to stave it off).
But the answer is the same - if it's a major world currency that is entrenched in the global economy, then the world economy is likely to collapse, meaning your money isn't worth anything anymore. Nobody cares about bits of paper (or Bitcoin) when they're looking for food and water.

There's no reason to believe that the USD and Bitcoin are mutually exclusive. 
There's growing evidence that the dollar *could* collapse, *if* the Fed continues printing money out of their ass ad infinitum, but frankly at some point other countries would put pressure on us to not kill the dollar because of their investments here.
Bitcoin won't die unless one of three things happens - something better is created, a giant gaping security hole is found and exploited, or the vast majority of people lose/never gain faith in it.
It's harder for the USD to rise in value than Bitcoin simply because it's inflationary, but it could (since value is all relative anyway) fall against Bitcoin slower than other currencies.

The United States dollar has virtual forms and is fractionally reserved, but it is not a virtual currency. Bitcoin is a virtual currency, just like Linden Dollars or Turbine Points or WoW gold. Bitcoin exists entirely online on the blockchain (no, your physical coins or paper wallets are not Bitcoins, they merely provide information needed to access them). It is certainly an alternative currency to the US Dollar, which was the point I made over a month ago in reference to this post:


As Bitcoin isn't a US Dollar, it is not Legal Tender within the US. In regards to credit cards as used within the United States, the only thing that would "make those dollars not legal tender" is if they weren't dollars or were being used in a location that does not require the US Dollar to be recognized as such.

If you a business owner in the United States, you are legally forced to accept the United States Dollar as repayment of *debt*. You can put reasonable restrictions upon that acceptance, such as "No checks" or "No bills over $20," but you must accept dollars. Can you refuse CC's? Yes you can.
We're not confused. Bitcoins are not Legal Tender (in the US). No other currency except the United States Dollar is "Legal Tender" in the US. That does not mean other currencies cannot be used, but they do not have that status. You are right that it does not make those dollars not Legal Tender, because *they are still dollars*. Credit cards are not virtual currencies. That example cannot be applied to Bitcoins or other virtual currencies, because they are not dollars. I think you are confused in thinking that CC's are virtual currencies, they are not, they are payment systems for whatever currency the customer and the merchant agreed upon. (in this case, the CC company pays the merchant with the understanding that you will pay them that amount plus any applicable fees).

Because they need taxes to function. I know anarchy is kind of a thing here, but most people don't want anarchy, so the government is going to need some form of taxation to operate. That's the compelling interest of the government to be able to regulate any currency that operates within sovereign borders (yes, this is a digital, borderless currency, but you still need to purchase real physical things with it from real, physical businesses.).
It's not *impossible* to regulate Bitcoin. It may be extremely invasive, but it's not impossible.

If people lose faith in Bitcoin's value as a currency or faith in the network, it becomes useless. If people lose faith in Gold's value as a currency (or store of wealth in countries where it is not a currency), it can still be used. This is their argument, that it will always have at least some use and therefore value. The same can not be said about Bitcoin. Gold having a higher perceived value than lead does not eliminate the fact that gold does indeed have inherent value.
If someone is going to use one of these absurd or fantastical arguments then I can also point out that we might, as a society, get rid of money or the notion of property completely one day. In that scenario, *gold still has a use and therefore value*, while financial instruments do not. The only scenario in which gold has no value is a scenario in which we discover that it's extremely hazardous to our health to be anywhere near it, and that it has become completely useless as a conductor, or thermal insulator, or EM-radiation shield. That would take a (figurative) quantum leap in our understanding of physics. The only thing that it would take to render Bitcoin useless is a loss of faith.

Democracy will always fail because it relies upon collective will, yet the way anarcho-capitalism realizes itself, in your view of the world, is through a collective society that organizes itself into zones of "law-sets?"
These two concepts are mutually exclusive - either collectivism can work, meaning democratic forms of government will not "always self-destruct," or it cannot work, meaning that democracy won't work, but neither will anarcho-capitalism. Either communities can work or they can't, which is a matter of opinion, but they can't fail only when you don't agree with what they have done, yet not fail when they suddenly support your idea of what society should be.

A community that works together works collectively. A community that decides they don't agree on laws becomes a set of people that live close to each other, but not a community. If everyone who produces a particular product that you NEED (such as *clean* water) decide that they won't sell to you because you aren't, say, paying them 10x what everyone else has to pay because they don't like you, you have no authority to appeal to.

I'm sorry you don't understand basic math. You also ignore the long history of the dollar up to that point and pretend that Bitcoin has the same history, not to mention the fact that I can actually use dollars everywhere, so volatility *now* is not the same as volatility when the currency is still trying to establish itself. But you knew that already.
@_date: 2013-08-23 06:31:37
If you cannot find anyone willing to accept your Bitcoin for any good or service, it is worthless as a currency. If you cannot find anyone willing to accept your Dollar for any good or service, it is worthless as a currency. It does not matter what other properties the Bitcoin or Dollar might have - at that point they do not function as currency.
"Their value as money" is part of the valuation of what I will give you in exchange, I.E., it's already counted. If I know the paper money you give me today will vanish tomorrow because of inferior paper quality/ink or whatever, I will not accept it.
Part of the current valuation of Bitcoin is the fact that acceptance at major merchants that people use every single day has not happened on a massive scale, yet. If it had, it would be worth well over $121 (the price on Gox as of this moment). The reason not everyone has bought into it yet (which would send the price per coin soaring) has played a part in determining the current value. It's already built-in to the price.
Basically, what I've stated is what is true with currency. I understand your point - that, for example, it is advantageous to carry the Dollar around as opposed to some other form of currency as everyone in the United States (and the vast majority of countries that I am likely to visit) accepts it. But that in and of itself is part of the value of the Dollar. It's already built-in. Confidence (or lack thereof) in the future of a currency already plays a role in the "price" of a currency. If everyone on the planet believed that the United States is going to collapse tomorrow, the Dollar would be worth nothing today.

If there are an infinite amount of virtual currencies you will end up confusing merchants and *most* users as they try to figure out which ones are legitimate (because not all will be on the up and up) and which ones aren't, which leads to people throwing up their hands and saying "Fuck it, I'm going back to something I think is stable (traditional fiat currency)." That's human nature.
Since that would be undesirable, there is an incentive to limit the amount of competing currencies. Is there an incentive to increase the amount of currencies above a handful? Possibly, as that would lend legitimacy to the concept of a crypto/digital currency/decentralized currency. What happens if people decide this other currency is better? People that hold onto Bitcoins dump them, causing more people to dump, etc etc. Bitcoin crashes as this new currency rises.
The question begins again, though - what if someone creates another currency? Eventually people will try to "get ahead" of the "inevitable crash" and the speed of this cycle accelerates. Eventually you get to the point where business' want something that is stable and can be banked (heh) on to be there a week from now. Where does that lead them? Traditional fiat currency which has a long history of being there.

Like any currency, it's worth whatever people are offering for it. No more, no less. If the market thinks it's worth more, it will go up, and if not, it will go down.
There is no intrinsic value in Bitcoin (unless you're willing to accept a circular argument), just like there is no intrinsic value in FIAT. The market will determine the value.
Converting from one currency to another before then converting to a third currency can sometimes yield good results, but this takes money (you lose money by using currency exchanges) and time (it is not instant).

Infinite divisibility removes the deflationary aspect of the currency, the same aspect that many point to as a "positive." If the currency can be manipulated at will, it holds no significant advantage over fiat.
"But I can transfer a BTC quickly and with very low cost!" You can already transfer Fiat quickly, so the only difference is cost. You're paying for insurance against fraud, BTC offers none, so that's why the cost of the transaction is so low. Do you believe that companies which have been proposed as a way to offset the risk of fraud are going to perform their services for free? *IF* these companies start to appear and gain enough use to convince people that they won't vanish tomorrow, and *IF* their prices are competitive with the traditional institutions, then BTC has a clear advantage. We aren't there yet.
Hoarding will force the currency to change, which will get people wondering what the difference really is, which hurts the long-term viability of BTC. If there is no clear advantage, then the risk of converting to BTC is too high. BTC cannot survive a concentration of wealth anymore than any other currency can. This is why the Dollar will fail in the future if current policies continue.
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:37:04
You are looking at the price of BTC compared to another currency. If you are looking at it in terms of, for example, USD, then you are looking at it in terms of an investment and not as a currency.
This is also true for the Euro, for example. The difference between a Euro or Dollar, and a Bitcoin, is that I can spend the former for goods and essential services directly. I cannot pay for taxes, student loans, rent or mortgage payments, utilities or food with bitcoins (the services that offer food delivery for bitcoins are transfering BTC to real currencies and using that to buy food - and are accepting the risk that BTC isn't a pump and dump).
There is a hard limit to the number of coins in existence. Right now, it is divisible to 8 decimal places. That means that as more people enter the system, each individual unit of currency is worth more. Unless you are advocating population control or that humanity will eventually stop expanding its population, this cannot be avoided. If you advocate the changing of protocol to allow more than 8 decimal places, you are implying that the underlying currency is not something that I can trust moreso than Fiat since the parameters can change at will. If it is no different than Fiat, why switch?

It was April and it is now November. It's hard to prove that downtimes were true DDOS attacks (we're taking their word for it) and not simply exchanges not being prepared to handle massive (relative to their normal stats at the time) data transmissions. You still obtain Bitcoins the same way you used to, only the number of businesses has increased. There is still confusion (the market does not know what the future will hold) in regards to regulation. Traders know that it was only the exchange that was taken down, not all the users of that exchange (meaning, the demand is still there and other exchanges have already formed).
Hashing power has gone up, which is fairly significant to the security of the network. The number of businesses has increased, but it is impossible to know *how* much, and how many others might have stopped accepting Bitcoin for whatever reason.

It seems our definitions of state are different then, because if you do not divorce yourself from a society then you are living within the rules of that society. If you agree to a transaction with another person, you are in a form of government that demands consensus with regards to that other person (since you both agreed upon the transaction). Enforcement powers would rest with the stronger of the two individuals. Government can be as small as you and I entering into an agreement.

"Oh, so exchanges could just arbitrarily decide to take my coins whenever they wanted and there is no recourse for me?"

The two are not equivalent or relevant to each other at all. A slave owner is not an elected official, you have no choice in who your owner is. I'm sorry but your analogy is ridiculous. If you insist on using it, then think of it this way - slaves who wanted to benefit from slavery should not have rebelled against their owners. "But that's disgusting!" Of course it is, that sort of decision is repugnant - it's also the result of the free market, since there was no regulation over slavery in many states. I didn't want to turn this into a free market bash, but you leave me no choice if you insist on using it.

I am not confusing anything. The way the network works means that the coins are not the OP's anymore. Bitcoin is distinctly different from traditional currency in this fashion.
It is not theft in the legal sense if the law does not recognize it as so. It doesn't matter what you or I think about it, it matters what the law thinks about it. *Could* precedent be developed? Sure, as I even said, but it's not there right now. And how can you now say "Well okay we'll have to bring the judges in" if the law is, as you claimed, irrelevant?

How would you be uncertain though if all the information is right there at your fingertips?
What I'm getting at is a profession is more than simply knowledge, and a huge DIY revolution in the way which you suggested would result in an awful lot of people dying or suing each other for harm done. "But we could sign a contract saying I'm not responsible!" Many states don't allow you to sign away those sorts of rights, so you're still screwed there. Even in the ones that will, you're still saddled with huge legal fees fighting the case.

To downplay these very real, actualized (these have all happened, this isn't a theoretical security flaw) problems with the currency is to try to sell the public on an idea without telling them exactly what they are getting into.
The Register is well-known for tongue-in-cheek titles and regular readers don't take them seriously.

I do not know, nor is it germane to the topic at hand, which is whether or not crypto-currencies should be recognized as a right.
I do not have to have a right to do something to be allowed to do something, however. I do not have a *right* to take the drug known as caffeine, yet the government has no law saying that such use is illegal, therefore I can drink caffeine. Whether the use of the dollar is a right or not means very little, because the government has not outlawed it, so I may use it. Let's say it is a right though - so? Again, we're talking about crypto-currencies, not the US Dollar. Let's say it isn't a right - so? The US government has not outlawed the use of the dollar (and has recognized its legitimacy as legal tender since the government accepts it as payment for taxes).
I do not know if it is a right, but it is explicitly allowed by the United States for US debt via [*31 USC Section 5103 - Legal Tender*]( I am unaware of such status existing for Bitcoin specifically yet, or crypto/math-based currencies in general.

The global, fiat-based economy could collapse in a day. Bitcoin could collapse in a day or even hours. We live in Interesting Times.

But it might be too late for the party that was wronged by a tainted judgment to do anything about it, depending on what the punishment was.

Orders these large are, more often than not, not real and merely there to create the illusion of a ceiling or floor for inexperienced traders. If you have a sell order up for 100, and I put up a 30,000 BTC sell order  you might think "Well shit, I'll never move my coins unless I undercut him..." and price your coins under 95 if you want to sell them. You re-list under 95, other people re-list under you, the price starts going down as more and more buy orders start to be filled by the descending undercut-war. This could possibly lead to a crash if the market is spooked easily. Eventually I scoop your cheaper coins, then remove my sell order and let the price slowly climb again. Now then, I probably don't do this unless I bought in for like 90 or less because there is a chance someone obliterates my sell-wall with a huge injection of fiat and starts to send prices soaring.

Right now those conditions do not exist. Since most people still need other currency to live, they need to convert BTC to their currency of choice. Exchanges assume the risk that BTC will not collapse overnight - they provide fiat currency to holders of BTC in exchange for said BTC. They need some incentive to assume this risk - either ideological (requiring them to have some other source of income that will pay for the costs of running an exchange), or monetary by charging fees for this service. There are apparently not enough people willing to use the ideological incentive, therefore we have monetized exchanges such as Gox.
There is no widely-known, widely-accepted free exchange yet because nobody who was willing to accept the ideological incentive has grown large enough to be recognized. However, technically, any single person can be an exchange in and of themselves - as said by Ilsensine, his/her friend assumed the risk that BTC would not collapse by trading their fiat for Ilsensine's BTC.

If Bitcoin is held by a bank though, they aren't going to do it for free. They might do it for less than traditional currencies because Bitcoin is easier to transfer, but the cost of transactions isn't in actually sending data (which costs pennies, if that) but in following the regulations surrounding the transaction, so the "advantage" of Bitcoin might not actually exist in this scenario.
I should have clarified that I meant large merchants though, they use banks.

Users of Bitcoins support miners, since without miners there is no Bitcoin network. Bitcoin miners processed transactions of Silk Road.

With Bitcoin, I can't force a reverse of a transaction.

Why would they care? It is, in theory, a currency. It doesn't matter how high or low it goes relative to another currency, insofar as what they will do with it is concerned.

Because Bitcoin is a currency, in theory. A stable price is good for a currency. There is no reason it cannot gain widespread adoption at $200, $100, $500, or any other particular figure. Some people say that the price *must* increase if more people start using it. Some people don't understand how currencies work, apparently.
But you don't care about the value as a currency. You proved it by quoting a price in dollars, and not saying "I will be able to buy X with one Bitcoin in the future." The more people think that Bitcoin is just an investment vehicle, the faster the currency fails.
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:21:24
Unfortunately by the time they have slept on it, it could vanish. This is not a stable currency that will not fall unless The World Ends, this is something that can plummet in minutes on bad news from governments/business'. Maybe in 5 years Bitcoin can be something that you can sleep on without worrying that you might lose everything, but it isn't there yet. Most people realize this, and are cashing out till there's more certainty from the business and regulatory world. This is not like the first crash years ago, or the one earlier this year.

It's honestly too early to tell if it's OH GOD SKY FALLING EVERYONE'S DOOMED or not. If the price is stable over the next few months, it will gain legitimacy as a currency. If not, it will probably be viewed forever as a speculative investment. It's a fun experiment to watch nonetheless!

You do indeed have the right to privacy and the right to free speech. As such Congress, thanks to Wickard, could use the Commerce Clause to tell a multi-state business (or a business that affects commerce in another state) that they can't deny you the ability to purchase goods or services from them strictly for your choice of clothing (since there could be a moral imperative and you should be free to travel wherever you wish, which might be hampered if say, no restaurants or inn's wished to do business with you).
If you grant the use of alternative currencies the status of a RIGHT, such a precedent would apply to it as well (if you were denied the ability to purchase food or shelter during travel, that could encourage you to not travel, impacting interstate commerce). Business' would be forced to accept the currency and the resulting overhead costs associated with it, even if in their estimation the financial gain would not be worth it. This is the exact opposite of a free-market solution that Bitcoin is frequently touted as.

It's an alternative to a bank in a very specific manner. At a bank, I can safely store my money to protect it from thieves (even if it's stolen, it's federally insured) or disasters that are more likely to happen at my home than the bank (fire, flood, misplaced, eaten by insects in the attic). And again, it's federally insured, so if a disaster of that nature *does* happen at the bank I'm not ruined. 
What is the risk of storing at a bank? Loss of purchasing power due to inflation because it's just sitting there doing nothing. Bank run on every single bank in the world that deals with dollars all at once.
Alternatively, I could "store" my purchasing power in Bitcoin. This eliminates the risk of a reduction in purchasing power due to inflation, and a bank run (the concept does not apply to Bitcoins).
What are the risks? Bitcoin crashes (extremely unlikely to occur in the near future with the dollar) while I'm asleep. Someone beats me with a $5 wrench to steal my wallet access information. Wallet could be lost (forget brainwallet info, paper wallet can be physically lost). Bitcoin doesn't crash, but is still devauled due to a huge dump of coins or loss of confidence.
It is an alternative to a bank. It just might not be a *great* alternative to a bank.

Proponents of Bitcoin claim it to be a currency. A currency that has shown an ability to fluctuate that much, that quickly, is not a very stable currency.
You can't ignore the drop anymore than you can ignore the rise. It happened. It wasn't a mirage. That was his point. If we're still at ~110-150 a year from now, then focusing on such a crazy swing would be silly (just as trying to focus on that short period where it was worth one cent would be today, it's clearly worth more than that), but we aren't there yet. The price is barely above the general trend, so the sudden spike and swings in price could be a simple market correction, but there is no way to tell if such a sequence of events will happen again, so all we have to look at is the past... which isn't very stable *right now*.

The thing is there was no reason to *expect* it to not fade off, because there was no history. No, people did not "know" that it would take off, they thought it might and decided to invest.
If you play Russian Roulette and win, that doesn't mean you made a great decision. "Well it worked, so it was a good decision" is a pretty poor investment strategy, and there are going to be a lot more people who lose their ass with the ups and downs of Bitcoin than those who actually generate wealth from it. There's a lot of groupthink on this sub though. I wonder how many people realize that the amount of people who own Bitcoin AND post in this sub is very small compared to the majority who are just looking to leech money from lucky investors.
It will be hilarious though if, in ten years, Bitcoin has taken off and turns into exactly what people wanted to get away from - a centralization of *wealth* into the hands of a few. People will be crying out about how it's unfair and blah blah, when they just don't want to admit that it's not monetary systems that are flawed, it's human greed.

Because the blockchain does not, and that is all that matters to the Bitcoin network. Either the network agrees with you or it doesn't, but it is the arbiter. The point is that it is not a perfect system, this is one of the problems right now with Bitcoin. It can be solved, but right now, those are not the OP's coins to the only entity that matters.


It is *completely* relevant. Especially when considering matters of due process. You must have legal standing in order to obtain legal a judgment that forces a person to do something they are not willing to do. That's the whole point of the law. Who forces this thief to send the coins back? What if they say "Fuck you, I refuse to send the coins back" and leave the OP twisting in the wind? What crime have they committed if there is no legal precedent? You and I agree this was theft - but theft in *legal* terms is a different entity. There must be legal precedent or there can be no enforceable judgment granted.

Your non-silkroad related transaction still uses miners that support it, or the next silkroad that the general public has not heard about yet. If the actions of a government forever taint people that use their currency for anything, then the actions of the network forever taint people that use bitcoin for anything.
The original quote implied that the person didn't kill a kid in Iraq because Bitcoin was used instead of the USD. Ignoring the fact that you have no idea what the Bitcoins you've had (other than those you've minted yourself) were *really* being used for, the quote implies that if I use a USD, I kill a kid, but if I use a Bitcoin, I don't. Did that person really mean that? Probably not, so they shouldn't have said it. War isn't the only thing the government pays for, just like drugs aren't the only thing Bitcoin has paid for.
My dollar transaction does not directly murder innocent people, just like your bitcoin transaction does not directly enable illegal goods and services to be bought. If you want to link the USD siphoning off money to fund war as a basis for his claim, then you can't disassociate the Bitcoin network from its darker uses. Just because there isn't a head crony over the network doesn't mean that the network can't also be used for the wrong things.
Eventually (if it has not already happened), governments will be able to trace the physical locations of miners. If it's connected to the internet, it can be traced, there are no perfect security systems. If a large population of miners that themselves are not SR/next thing users are on the network, it allows the SR/next thing users to stop mining and reduce the chance that they will be caught (reduces the number of machines connected to the network). This increases the anonymity and security of the illegitimate market. Miners therefore directly benefit that market.
My taxes benefit a government that then oversees Bad Things. Your Bitcoin transactions benefit a network that then oversees Bad Things. These are equivalent. We can even stop them the same way! I can vote my government out of power just as a Bitcoin user can vote a blockchain out of "power" (I.E., get enough support to do so).

Either you have it or you don't. People have been waiting past the 20 day limit they agreed to when they deposited the money.

There isn't any, but Bitcoiners will try to tell you the intrinsic value is in the storage of wealth or some other nonsense (ignoring that if nobody accepts it in the future there isn't any value in that either). It, like the Dollar, is only valuable if people think that it's valuable.

It was an experimental currency that had no promise of sticking around. If you believed the general public would buy into it before something better came along, then you invested in it. If you didn't, you didn't. It isn't any more complicated than that.
Even today, there is no guarantee that Bitcoin will be the future, just like there is no guarantee that any other currency including the USD will be the future.

If governments begin to control Bitcoin, it destroys one of the original goals of the currency - to be unregulated. If one goal is destroyed, what prevents the other goals from being destroyed? People will stay away from Bitcoin since at that point it offers very, very little over a more traditional currency, and at the same time, is accepted at FAR less businesses.
What I'm getting at is this is not a plan to control, but to destroy it. If, one by one, the benefits of Bitcoin are erased, then there is no point to the currency anymore.

Your title says you want the use of crypto-currencies to be deemed a right. Is that a dramatization?
In fact a company cannot turn away business in certain instances such as the Heart of Atlanta motel case, the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress can force a business to accept customers they do not wish to accept. That precedent could easily cover the use of alternative currencies.
In your edited reply you state a right does not equal compulsion, and that is correct. However, if a customer wished to use bitcoin and a business did not want accept it, that business would (unless it is completely and utterly isolated with little to no influence on interstate commerce) be forced to accept it anyway, if the use of bitcoin were a *right* granted by the government.

If I can't buy groceries, or pay my utilities, or buy a house, or pay taxes, or pay loans, or buy insurance, or pay a roofer/plumber/electrician etc, it's worthless to *me*.
There's not much unique about me, but there's *nothing* unique about the situation I just described. The fed likes control over monetary supply and use, and therefore if Bitcoin were ever in a position to allow me to do the things I just described, they would crash all confidence in it (even if the currency itself is sound, it relies on trust, and most people do not trust it now nor would they trust it after a major crash).

You stated that it is not corruption to refuse to sell a product to someone. I agree that, in and of itself, the decision to sell a product is one that cannot be forced upon you.
But, you then went on to state that you can single people out for any reason you wish. If, say, people decide that they don't like person X because person X has laws that ban language historically used for racial discrimination from being uttered on their property, they could say "We agree to place a stone wall all around the outside of that property, but not touching it, and ban anyone or anything from crossing the wall. We will also sever any land-line that would otherwise service the property with electricity." They could literally close you off from the world and force you to change your law. Imagine if they do this before you construct anything that would allow you to live off the grid, and now you cannot obtain materials to do so.
Now maybe there are certain laws for which that would be an appropriate means of action. But because the person doesn't like offensive speech? Ah, but Free Speech should be protected, you might say! I would agree. Okay, then let's replace the law barring that sort of speech with one that said "On my property, no one shall be allowed to wear the color red on any part of their person." So now it's okay to close this person off from the world because they don't like the color red?
Are these actions likely to occur? No, but they *could*. And if they did, what recourse would there be?

I do not know Coinbase's intentions - I don't work there nor am I privy to their internal conversations. But when the same problem comes up again, and again, and again, I have to assume one of three things is occurring.
1) Coinbase is regularly screwing customers, and are probably only "fixing" problems when those problems are aired in public (I.E. a Reddit post).
2) Coinbase is incompetent and cannot maintain the necessary liquidity or reserve to meet demand while at the same time not coming right out and saying this.
3) There is a conspiracy to ruin their image. I doubt this one much more than the other two because the negative effect of being caught could eviscerate a competing exchange's level of public trust in their service, which then kills the exchange. Yes, I know Coinbase isn't an exchange, but it competes with them for the same customer - people looking to buy Bitcoins.

It's also funny to see people whine about "the free market" when they don't understand that the world itself is a free market. You can do whatever you have the ability to enforce, be it through laws, money, or physical force. The world really does operate under the free market principle.

They aren't his/her bitcoins, they have not been since they left his/her wallet according to the network, the only arbiter that matters. Morally? Yeah, u/CoinTrade was screwed, assuming the story is correct. This was theft. It sucks.
But this is the wild west of currency. There is no legal recourse unless CoinTrade's country of residency recognizes first that Bitcoins are a currency, and second have outlawed the theft of said currency (usually already in place to protect recognized currencies). If it's America, there must be a federal law in place (assuming this theft took place across state and/or international lines) or recognition by SCOTUS/the federal circuit CoinTrade resides in that Bitcoin is a currency and falls under the same protections that other currencies enjoy. If it's the 5th Circuit (Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas) then the recent news of a federal judge declaring that Bitcoin is a currency might give him/her some legal ground to stand on.

The act of mining Bitcoin does not make a Bitcoin valuable. If nobody accepts Bitcoin in exchange for something, that means Bitcoin is worthless. Something is only worth whatever the highest bidder is willing to give you for it. No bidders means no value, unless your entity has an inherent value (such as an apple which you can eat).
Some people put forth the argument that Bitcoins are still worth something because they are proof of work. What work? Proof of transactions of Bitcoins? That's a circular argument.

This would in effect create Bitcoins out of nothing, which would erase one "strength" of the currency. What happened with the fork is eventually the majority of users rejected one of the blocks and therefore it was eliminated.

Living standards have increased over the long term with the currencies we have now. It can happen in either type of currency.
I'd like to see a market where people are comfortable with the idea of Dotcom-like bubbles being something that just happens with revolutionary technologies. People were scared of that though, and so we ended up with what you have today, regulations that simply introduce different types of bubbles =/
I'm not sure I would buy the argument of Bitcoin being inflationary since there will be a finite amount of coins "minted" - yes, by altering the protocol, you can extend the divisions of a single coin continuously, but that introduces a whole new set of problems (namely, why use a currency that is as easy to manipulate as fiat if the idea of the currency is to get away from easily manipulatable fiat currencies).

It could. Nobody knows for sure what the currency of tomorrow will look like.
It could be a cryptocurrency. It could be fiat. It could be something we haven't thought of before. It might not even exist if society deems money to be unnecessary (not likely any time soon). If I had to pick what I thought would last longer, Bitcoin or fiat, I would go with fiat because it's backed with real physical force, whereas Bitcoin is backed by the trust that more than 50% of the network does not decide to steal everything from the remaining portion of the network.
It's a grand experiment and encouraging to see public solutions attempting to solve complex, long-standing problems.

Because it's new. Word gets out about this, people start asking "Well hell, if I can just spend this thing over and over, what's to prevent me from doing it all the time?"
The answer is frighteningly, "Nothing." So what happens when a merchant looks at his wallet, sees +50 BTC, then looks at his wallet after the blockchain updates and sees that the blockchain didn't agree with him so he's out 50 BTC? He could delay the delivery of product/service till confirmation is acquired, but now you're asking the buyer to put his trust in a vendor, and there will be vendors who will screw buyers. They will take BTC and run, and when enough people find out about them they will simply vanish and start up again somewhere else since you can't trace them.
This isn't the only vulnerability with the system, it's just one of the ones gaining exposure.

Every miner is responsible for supporting silk road, because their machines are, at least, partly responsible for transactions that take place on silk road (to the same extent that pacifist Americans are responsible for killing that kid in Iraq). Every non-miner that still uses Bitcoins relies on miners to process their transactions, thus, supporting silk road.
That's the line of reasoning being used here. It's absurd, because I don't support the killing of human beings any more than the average Bitcoin user supports assassinations and drug deals that were bought via silk road.

The only thing that happens there is the volatility moves from one business to another. Someone will get stuck with the huge risk. Again, this is how you go out of business.
Whoever the end assumer of risk is, they also assume that Bitcoin will become stable before they become insolvent (as they have to pay for goods and services unable to be bought with Bitcoins).

But you're not better than that (as a whole, not you specifically), there are many Bitcoin bugs who would do the exact same thing that the 1% would do. They do not care who gets hurt, as long as it isn't them (even if they're too blinded by greed to realize that it hurts them too).

TL;DR - UL is *used* by authorities as a way of determining if particular goods or services meet a set of standards that those authorities have come up with. If you cannot get them to sign off on it, your product or service isn't going to be approved by those authorities. UL isn't used for everything under the sun, but when they are, they do not have to be there to enforce anything because the people requesting their help are going to be the ones enforcing the underlying approval/disapproval.

If they mine, then hoard, then sell you machines to give you increased share of future coins, then watch the price go slowly upward (because they have you thinking that's all it will ever do, increase), then sell all of their btc, they've just made money off of you twice.
There is NO incentive for them to not do this, because there is no guarantee another vendor won't do it first. If there were guarantees that no vendor anywhere would do this then it would make sense to continue selling ~~tulips~~ mining machines to users to make continued profits.
Also, one of the stated goals of Bitcoin is to get away from a system where a few people control a large majority of the wealth. So to do this, they want to create a system where a few people (early adopters) control a large majority of the wealth. Brilliant.

I do not believe the two are equal. A slave had a choice to attempt to escape to another country or the North, at the risk of death for themselves and their family, or stay and accept their circumstances. A terrible choice either way.
A citizen can change their ruling class, they need not eliminate the position. Yes, you actually can vote other people into office (go to your primaries). Oh, yes, it's incredibly difficult to unseat those that the rich back, but if enough people are truly ready for new leadership, they will vote for it. They can also influence their leaders to change the manner in which the community funds (taxes) are spent. Occupy didn't work because not enough people believed in it - we believed in it on Reddit (hell, I supported that cause) but the very loud voices here do not reflect the entire country. Wall Street protests didn't work because not enough people believed in it. Vietnam protests worked because enough people believed in them (yes, there were mounting casualties, but why would the military frankly care as long as they could replace soldiers). If we were truly slaves to government that government would have been able to force us to shut up and sit down in this nice little cargo plane over here while they shipped us overseas.
The goods and services you and I enjoy today are impossible without a collective group effort (unless we find a way to completely automate everything and can truly be self-sufficient individuals). Government is that collective group effort. Now, the *form* of that government can change, but to say that *no* government is the best is to say that humanity has arrived at a point where we can solve every single difference in an amicable, reasonable fashion and achieve progress through compromise and complete trust that the other person will actually do what they say they will. I do not believe that day is today.

You put all your extra cash in Bitcoin. Okay, now what? Bitcoin is going to increase in value - why would you ever spend it? If you never spend it, why would merchants ever bother with accepting it? If you never spend it then it is literally worthless.
It's only "easier to stay in Bitcoin" if you can pay bills, buy gas, buy a house, pay rent, buy clothes etc in Bitcoins, which you can't. Since you can't, it isn't "easier to stay in Bitcoin."

Yes, we are greedy, selfish beings. It's served us well for a long time. Do you think the removal of regulation would put you at an advantage compared to those who do this sort of thing every day already? You are not going to be in a better position compared to them, because they aren't going to allow it. If regulation was so good for Wall Street, why would they fight it?

There are no rules to this game, because there is no regulation. This is the Wild West, exactly what people who jumped into Bitcoin signed up for. Nobody is your buddy here. Read *multiple* websites and sources to try and arrive at a picture that approximates the truth, and make your decisions based on that.
The reason you're seeing a ton of up and downvotes right now is that people are trying to manipulate the market. Drowning out opinion which they don't agree with and promoting that which they do is part of the game. So is trying to project an idea onto the market, regardless of what you actually think.

If we already track these things then why would we need to make insider trading legal? If the information is already there, then why take more legal avenues for those looking to right the wrongs off the books?
Insider trading laws are there to force a company/the employees to disclose problems that may lower its perceived worth before they then attempt to make money on the change in worth. Like all man-made laws, they are still broken occasionally because of selfishness. Unless you're advocating the removal of /all/ laws because they don't always work, there is no reason to remove these. If insider trading suddenly became legal, what incentive would there be to not intentionally manipulate the price through what appeared to be "normal" insider trading?

They told you the terms of your purchase when you made it, now you want to cancel that agreement because you're having problems? That's not how a business works.

There would eventually be a need for more as the number of people using bitcoin grow, which in a possible future where bitcoin is the currency of civilization means when the population grows. Eventually the underlying protocol would have to change.

If you honestly think looking up your symptoms on WebMD suddenly replaces *years* of medical research, done by professionals who do that sort of thing for a living, you are naive and going to end up hurting yourself or someone you love.

So the State is responsible for all of the woes corporations brought us, and not the corporations themselves? Listen to what you're saying - businesses are doing everything they can within the existing rules to generate maximum profit, but somehow they will act in a benevolent fashion if those rules ceased to exist? Free market competition will lower prices and the giant corporations that already exist will not buy up whatever competition doesn't agree to price-fix? And when they refuse to sell, those corporations will not all agree to crush the little guy by taking losses in the short term?
There is no bankruptcy without the State, so there is no way to continually create small, competitive businesses that could continually force the big guys to choke themselves, unless you believe that people will sacrifice themselves for the greater good.
How do they start their business, by the way, when the corporations tell their suppliers that they will do business only with suppliers that refuse to sell to the little guy?

Assuming that because *you* don't see a design flaw means there isn't one there that will be discovered later is very arrogant.
Implementations *can* fail, but so can technologies.

This is why Bitcoin isn't going anywhere - you just talked about it in terms of fiat. You aren't the only one. Bitcoiners talk endlessly about gains *relative to fiat* and aren't talking about the currency itself.
"I'm rich!" Why, because you can buy whatever you want in Bitcoin, or because you can transfer it to a useful currency and then buy what you want?
Would anyone be interested in a tulip?

I'm not talking me, I'm talking about him. If he's telling the truth, he knows specifics about the plan that the public does not, specifics that might impact the stock price. I'd rather not see a guy get locked up because of his excitement.

You can do whatever you want if enough people support you. This is true in life as it is with Bitcoin.

Why do you think you will not have hidden manipulation if regulation is removed?
What prevents a business from deliberately cooperating with employees to manipulate their own buying and selling of stock? There is an extreme incentive to collude to make it seem as if the business is better than it really is if the business believes that outsiders will act based upon what they (the outsider) believe is the hidden, juicy details.
Right now, regulation at the very least dissuades casual manipulation, and grants legal recourse to the few who are willing and able to go after offenders. Regulation that is enforced would reduce manipulation to an outlier, providing trust to investors that they can rely on what they are being told the majority of the time. Why is there widespread manipulation today? Because the regulations are not being enforced, not because regulations are present.

There is no incentive to competitively price anything if the rich are already buying these in bulk.
