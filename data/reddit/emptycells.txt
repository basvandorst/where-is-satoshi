LocalBitcoins is another SegWit supporting option.

Also today bitmain opened up orders on a new lot of antminer s9s for which they are only taking bcash.

Ah, buys are disabled too. It must only be available on gdax right now?

I was trying to sell bch on coinbase at under 4k and sells were disabled
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:01:16
It's her bitcoin faucet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:44
It's apparently what you had in bitcoin on coinbase during the fork. 
Selling bch on coinbase is apparently currently disabled. WTH.

Because he can protect a source. No offense, but isn't this obvious?
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:00:13


I did not say this, but I did imply that we might not be able to protect a source.


To an extent I respect your opinion on established journals, but I don't appreciate being talked to like that. Anyhow, so it goes.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:45:15
I'll clarify. Some will believe, but it will be considered rumor. A journalist would provide a better audience.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:43:34
Maybe it could be done safely, but working with a journalist would still most likely be safer. Journalists have some protection from being subpoenaed.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:43:32
It almost sounds good in theory. I don't know that a forum moderator has the ability to protect a source. I personally see parallels between a forum moderator and a journalist, but I have my doubts.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:02:37
You can, but nobody would believe an anonymous poster.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:14:34
It's difficult, but I'm going to assume you really mean what you're saying and are not trolling me...
I did not say that in every instance sources are properly vetted. I truly believe that modern journalism is severely flawed. Would you really believe an anonymous person on here over an established journal?
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:55:56
Yes. Reporters will vet their sources. Established sources tend to have reputations to maintain.

Namecoin also has a limit of 21 million generated coins.

It's not showing up in the subreddit. Apparently the spam filter grabbed it.
@_date: 2012-06-20 04:13:42
It doesn't seem like we're growing much faster than other subreddits near our size. I think that part of the reason for our growth is that reddit is generally more active during the summer.
 
(*edit: I misread the subreddit ranking graph.)

I mostly agree. Although it's hard to say what NASA is capable of with the right tasks and leadership.
My views aren't quite as strong as it may have appeared. I was picking up on the tone of the comment I responded to.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:32:33
This is a good question. Also relevant to people who have lost their Mt. Gox history and therefore cost basis. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:19:25
It's an interesting comment. The antithesis to that argument is that the government is the one spending its own money (the people are ideally the government), while businesses are often the ones spending other people's money (investors and costumers). Neither argument is correct. They are both based on idealistic views.
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:30:04
Get real. Although private industry may do many things better in today's society (especially innovation), the only thing private industry is guaranteed to do better is line their pockets and lobby the government.

The crime he most blatantly plans to commit is theft. He intends to deprive people of Namecoins which are rightfully theirs.
Less obviously, I think he is committing fraud. My knowledge of law is lacking, but the block chain certainly seems like a contract.
@_date: 2011-09-08 04:48:10
They would like to somehow link them to a local commodity. Did you RTA?
@_date: 2011-09-13 14:11:41
The reason people don't often get prosecuted for some computer crimes is because it's usually difficult to do. This guy is apparently planning it with some IT department (I think he implied it was at Apple). If his personality in real life is similar to what comes across on the internet, I wouldn't be surprised if he has acquaintances who are willing (maybe waiting) to turn him in. 
@_date: 2011-07-18 13:27:59
The rules seem overly complicated. 
Why do referral links expire? What is the point of withdrawal fees? Why are withdrawals automatic and at such a low amount? The random payments are very confusing. How often are the random payments sent? Are they just taken from random members' balances? How exactly do random payment chances depend on the sum of deposits? 
I prefer how the [Bitcoin Randomizer]( worked. Everything was much more clearly defined. Unfortunately, they got hacked and the developer seems to have completely abandoned the project.
@_date: 2011-06-29 17:29:16
Poor journalism, indeed. It's just plainly bad writing. If he has a point to make, he should make it. He shouldn't just appeal to an authority.
@_date: 2011-06-25 03:46:26
The post has yesterday's date on it. It confused me. I thought I just hadn't noticed it earlier.

Less miners ≠ less coins mined
@_date: 2011-09-13 13:25:58
Does Bitcoinexpress realize that he's publicly planning on breaking the law? In fact, I believe he is already guilty of conspiracy.
@_date: 2011-07-31 06:53:46
The BUY BUY BUY is rather hard on the eyes :-/
@_date: 2011-07-26 04:49:57
No, I don't believe that it does have any advantages. Ben Laurie seems to not fully grasp bitcoin. One reason I posted this is as yet another example of a bitcoin critic without a valid argument. 
Also, the [linked NPR story]( about Brazil was enjoyable. =)
@_date: 2011-09-13 20:09:57
Ah, but the block chain is a record... And criminal intent can be proven.
Also, I believe there IS a specific exploit involved in the 51% attack.. It has something to do with how Geist Geld was attacked, I guess.
There are potential fixes other than upping the network's hash rate. A fix that was already supposed to be coming is merged mining. Checkpoints can potentially help maintain the integrity of the block chain. 
@_date: 2011-09-13 19:20:15
I'm not mad. Stop projecting your feelings onto me. 
@_date: 2011-07-31 14:02:07
It seems that Mt. Gox was goxxed again.. [Here]( is a thread with more discussion.
The low is currently $2. I've had a couple of transactions rolled back.
Perhaps the huge buy order was put in by Gox as a security implement..?

Sales belong at [@_date: 2011-09-13 20:38:59
Perhaps you weren't asking why I was mad?  What's with the weird punctuation?
@_date: 2011-10-18 17:54:22
What data was made up? Who called him out on it? What are you even referring to? The analysis with the chart is obviously speculation, not data.
I don't see much a personal attack. You are using ad hominem yourself.. *ahem* Not classy. 
@_date: 2011-10-14 15:29:43
I don't see how it could be devastatingly bad. He's just trademarking a word. Also, it's only France. So we can call bitcoins something else on the exchanges in France, people will still know what they are. It seems that this leech is just wasting his time.
@_date: 2011-06-25 16:03:28
Nah, it was GMT. JST is later than GMT, so either way it was the wrong date. It made it look like it was posted less than an hour after the previous post.
@_date: 2011-09-13 19:37:44
I'm not entirely sold on the idea that it's not fraud, but it's interesting to think about. I need to learn more about the specific exploit they plan on using and about potential fixes. Will a restore point be possible? Will the block chain split? 
@_date: 2011-08-01 22:29:37
Now they have 7=)
It looks like they have some interesting movies. I'm downloading one now. If I enjoy the site, I'll donate some BTC.

He wasn't calling "smart" traders "the real criminals." You have a reading comprehension problem.
I haven't seen any reason why Kevin is more suspicious than others who put in .01 bids, but I don't have all of the facts. None of us have all of the facts.
@_date: 2011-06-17 20:38:59
In any case, a little added security could only be a good thing. 
Requiring a pin for transactions, perhaps entered with a mouse, would add another layer of security.
