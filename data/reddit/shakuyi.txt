Have you ever taken a Marketing class? One of the first things they teach you is that an upset customer will tell 9 people and a happy customer will only tell 3.
Have you ever worked in Customer Service?  If yes then you will know the customer is always right.
Businesses need to adjust to the needs of the consumer or they will hear about it, simple as that.

Touchy subject don't forget people have money invested into this, it's not like you are going to be lenient on your bank when they fuck up right?  These companies should be no different.

Found this from a quick Google search...nothing major but companies rethinking their strategy because it didn't work isn't anything new.

The point is that people will complain because their own money is on the line.  If you can't view your wallet, perform a transaction successfully or even have good customer service you should expect a big backlash.  We should not treat them differently for this, money is money regardless of where it is held.  If these companies can't keep up and stop the complaints then they need to rethink their strategy.  This is a critical time for Bitcoin and it should be treated as such, you can't expect the public to adopt the standard when you can't get core functions working properly without complaint.

Nobody said the internet is supposed to be a pretty place.  Many companies make lots of bad decisions and after some online backlash they rethink their strategy.  If you want to take control of the situation learn how it behaves and take it from there.  Don't tell people not to complain because otherwise how will they know their faults?
Backlash is just the nature of the beast, how you handle the backlash and prevent future backlashes is what gets you ahead of the game.  Don't fight it, embrace it.
