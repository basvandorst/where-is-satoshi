But what if the hardware wallet malfunctions. I've had cheap External HDs and Flashdrives that wiped all my information on them just by dropping them, If that were to happen to my Wallet, do I just lose everything or is there another way to access the wallet?

As a aspiring entrepreneur, how exactly do you go about charging people for the work you’ve done? I imagine it must take longer to fix than you actually charge for?
Also just put up a Bitcoin sign, it speaks for itself

Throwing shade here arentcha.. guess everybody interprets a little bit sentence differently eh?
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:19:13
Literally, you can say that about absolutely anything and it still doesn’t mean it’s a good idea.
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:35:09
Do you know of any that don’t?
If you do, advise me cause I would like some recommendations..
@_date: 2018-08-21 23:47:35
I mean, I could...
Not a great idea though..
@_date: 2018-08-31 14:20:59
Hey he stole my idea!
Here’s my address! Send me bitcoin and I will double it in 24 hours through the exact same convoluted process as him!
I GUARANTEE IT...
Seriously though man, have some common sense, a complete stranger isn’t going to go out of their way to save you. You’re going to get hurt because your looking at life through your rose-coloured glasses and will miss all the red flags.. 
don’t do it man.

Without peer-to-peer, do we not just give the wealth and power back to the corrupt institutions who do what they want with it?
Seems like a no-brainer to me.. I’m not buying into another institution, fuck that.

Say you buy some crypto from the exchange (that has your photo identification, email, and possibly logs your IP) using someone’s credit card, against their will, how exactly do you suppose you remain anonymous? 
@_date: 2018-08-03 04:11:17
Ah I didn’t realize you were OP. Whoops!
As far as I’m aware, you cannot buy crypto (with credit cards atleast) without ID. 
If were one were so keen on doing so, one could purchase other online products using the card, and then sell the product for bitcoin.

So what are the consequences for those involved in the fraud / scandal, and how can this be prevented going forward? 
That’s what I want to know, any links would be greatly appreciated.
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:19:01
It’s atleast 2 I know that...
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:21:08
All these answers alone makes me want to exchange for other crypto. I invested money I could afford to lose, if it drops to nothing, ahh well good try atleast I’ve got eggs in different baskets.. but seeing so many dense individuals here makes me wonder if bitcoin has any future at all.. everyone holding here is just here for the investment returns, not the vision; if bitcoin is just going to be bought into by people like those in this subreddit it truly is doomed..
Everything said in r/Bitcoin nowadays makes me convinced this subreddit is definitely full of retarded amateur investors.. what a shame..
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:59:41
Is the trade volume between tether and other cryptocurrencies really that high or is it more of a speculation?
I’d have to imagine that if the possibility for the fraud is there, it’s not unreasonable to think it is indeed happening. I could see it all crashing still, but if bitcoin and other real cryptocurrencies fulfill the vision they have set, with a limited supply and mass integration, it’s value should continue to rise over time and should revolutionize the way we think of currency. The power of crypto is not in its ability to raise in value then be traded in for fiat, it’s power is in its ability to bring down the impossible fiat economy as a whole.
Until the powers that be decide a better currency is one that can be infinitely reproduced; that’s my understanding of crypto atleast..
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:14:02
On a side note though, at what point does fiat ever start to increase in value, and stop inflating enough that it still shows promise in being a significant store of value? 
I think not only will the banks have to bow down, the only way the current system of economics can hold steadfast against bitcoins vision, is by regulation to the nth degree, or creating their own currency with they ability to change the rules whenever they need... otherwise, if bitcoins promise remains, it seems likely that the economic system would move over into a greater store of value; one that does actually return prosperity to the people, rather than that which returns prosperity to those who issue, and therefore, inflate the currency.
Just my two cents. Could be wrong.
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:27:31
I thought ATMs weren’t going to take note of that?
@_date: 2018-07-10 05:54:36
They can if they create their own currency... again..
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:32:41
It seems like this concept is really difficult to grasp for some in this sub.. often by the same people who erroneously believe crypto and bitcoin is the be all to end all when it comes to regulated hyper-inflationary currency.
Currency is currency, any cryptoCurrency can be made in such a way that it inflates (Monero for example) and any currency implemented by the banks can be centralized, regulated, enforced, and ultimately monitored..
The fact of the matter is; If the banks had their way, which they tend to, cryptocurrency would be the same shit, different pile... it’s really not that hard to imagine.

I see cardano is bitcoins workout buddy.. wicked pumps boys..

Wear contacts; gotcha haha
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:38:30
A lot of them were fake anyways.
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:32:48
I’m sure That’s exactly what OP was getting at, it’s hard for most people to truly realize something without having experienced it first hand..
So long as we live in an interest-based economic system, so long will we have to raise debt ceilings and crash markets.
We need an economic system that has incentive not to charge interest.. no idea how that’s gonna work though.

How will they know if you have any if you buy through the Bitcoin ATMs?
