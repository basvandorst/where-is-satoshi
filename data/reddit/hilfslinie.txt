Well, I didnt ask this, and I meant not because they are stupid, but because they dont know anything about this topic. Knowledge is not intelligence
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:42:13
Well then why dont you click twice? xD
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:21:07
It‘s not stupid not to know about a certain topic. Knowledge is not intelligence.
It is stupid tho to invest in something you don‘t know about (but this „article“ gives a false perception on a topic so...)

I don‘t think that in this text is anything that would reveal that it is a scam or you could loose money... well because it‘s a scam
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:14:44
This is what is done way to rare on the internet: changing the own opinion when an other viewpoint comes up. Very respectable!
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:22:48
People shouldnt be scammed in the first place

Wait what... oh...

Seriously, not everything that displays bad news is a conspiracy against bitcoin!
1.	The heist is something big that just happened. So it‘s actual „news“
2.	Bad news get clicked more often. I don‘t know why, but people like to read bad news (just look at the trashiest newspaper in your country)
3.	Why the hell should facebook be against bitcoin? They would risk way too much with this.
4.	the best one: new all time highs are nothing new for bitcoin anymore ;)
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:34:48
Yeah, but shouldnt be bitcoin *better* than gold? ;)

There was a octopus who predicted most of the outgoings in the 2012 football (the real one) world championship.
What I want to say: Everybody can make one or more right guesses, but it never implies that the next one is correct
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:16:42
Explain please?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:08:46
I don‘t think OP means the technical aspect of bitcoin, but the financial
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:22:47
Yeah, I am just a student, so money is very limited ��
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:56:12
Actually, no. What is that?
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:59:12
Yeah, or fall down to 0... I stand by the "traditional" bitcoin. These knockoffs... Not my jam
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:01:17
The lesson i learned: *this* was a opportunity missed. Other investments (could) have failed. 
The lesson (what you probably meant) learnt is: Take an opportunity to buy Bitcoin when granted one
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:47:07
How much did you invest?
