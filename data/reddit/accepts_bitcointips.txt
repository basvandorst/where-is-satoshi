Uuuuugh. My first transaction won't clear until the 9th, so I won't be able to take advantage of this drop. I didn't even know that they did that until now. 
It's 4 AM here so I guess I'm off to sleep as well. Damn it :/

Somebody's on a mission...

I do hope they keep us updated on how, exactly, the plan to sue someone (whose identity they don't know and is impossible to find out) for saying something on the internet.

It's already too late--it's been linked all over this sub recently. In a few days it'll be gg; any intelligent discussion will be drowned out in favor of braindead "TO THE MOON LULZ" comments and there's nothing that can be done to stop it.
I'll have to find somewhere else to lurk...again. Thanks the circlejerk version of @_date: 2013-12-17 04:11:06


They very clearly tell you that it will take a few days to get your coins. Don't be an asshole because things didn't go as you expected.
