Oh okay, guess you don't have to pay the IRS anymore.

Lol it's a public ledger. The govt will just look at where your CB acct withdrew to and track your assets either way.

imo it would be hard to beat the value of bitcoin logos on gameheart maps. i would take that and put it in the capable hands of someone like TB to get the best return.

Let the crypto whales rob us instead.

More like going out of business.

They do that so you can track your own spending. It's not nefarious but the spending report graphs that come in the statements are really useful for personal budgeting. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 02:45:02
It literally is their business if you're using their bank.

I have some bad news for you..
@_date: 2019-08-09 07:49:18
How would you get btc into a 529? There's no etf yet

Everyone compares BTC to the stock market tech bubble all the time.

20k eoy. Institutions are watching retail sentiment real closely. The moment you sell your stack is the moment it'll reverse big time. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 18:13:59
The ticker alone shows they can't take it seriously. I hope Van Eck doesn't do something that stupid if they want people to invest serious money. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:29:48
The btc core blocks are the same pools every time too. Pos is the only viable consensus mechanism 
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:26:57
CSW is doing God's work purging the fake coins from this ecosystem. BCH is a cancer to BTC. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:22:24
Read the white paper

Uncle Sam is coming for you boy.
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:57:08
Just use Abra. It's really good and you can move it to usd way quicker when it's dumping. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 18:56:09
Alright just thirty years to go

I think ETF will get approve and I will be driving green lambos to hot yoga in Hollywood hills. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 21:03:23
He's the idea guy. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 03:13:47
This is great. Ignore the haters, this is something actually useful for people in situations that warrant setting up easy inheritance solutions.
@_date: 2018-11-16 01:51:32
Not the alt coins but btc, ltc, and bch are natively supported. 
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:19:32
If you are willing to let them hold your coins until they allow withdrawal then it's a fine option. They are cheap and reputable.
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:30:07
It is real bitcoin, they have a similar custody setup as coinbase. 
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:56:29
Props for owning up to it bro.
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:42:35
Yeah, it's really not bad. You can transact much quicker than other platforms too if you're into trading crypto. I wouldn't recommend it over coinbase pro for hodling however.
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:48:33
You claimed they are not holding real crypto. I am showing you that your assertion is untrue.
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:52:31
Bro look up the ethics of USD.
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:47:43
Why would bitcoin fail?
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:18:33
It's definitely not sec etf insiders, Bakkt delayed, or the futures market resolving on the same day. It's Craig's fault. 
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:26:22
You can only sell for cash on rh, not withdraw to wallet.
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:09:04
Dude you're thinking too much. Just hodl it and if everyone else does then we will be rich and buy lamboz
