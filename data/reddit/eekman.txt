Try looking at your transaction history in blockchain.info It puts them at todays value. To think i had a million dollars touch my hands for a moment...

I accept your criticism and have edited my post accordingly. Thank you sir.

I think it provides value by artificially increasing transactions, thus further testing the bitcoin concept and the strength of the network. Its not attempting to deceive (at least it appears that way, transaction fees may prove otherwise) 
It's pretty clear its gambling. It's a toy. Bitcoin is beta software. This is just QA testing.

If i wasnt such a crappy day trader id think about doing the same thing. Its hard to be productive at your job when over the weekend you make more than your monthly salary. Its ok though cause I lost 12 bitcoins because Im emotional, change my trading strategy almost daily and love to get steamrolled by the market when I try to short.

Keep in mind that these businesses might be 1 or 2 guys and they arent used to the sudden exponential volume. Ive never had a problem with bitfloor or localtill. They probably just got hammered and have a lot on their plate at the moment. I moved BTC to other sites yesterday and they also took a day to show up when they showed up instantly before. Growing pains. Lets cool our jets a bit.

Bitcoin could be a way of monetizing 'likes' or 'upvotes' 
I should be able to point my smartphone camera at anyone and send them money. Google glass could allow you to simply gesture at anyone then say 'give 1 internets' i want some way to encourage people to be nice randomly.

It freaks me out that a dollar is worth a millibitcoin. Ill be saying that again when a dollar is worth a microbitcoin.

Ive been to zeitgeist meetings. I identify with the philosophy. I also identify with bitcoin. 
Bitcoin makes national borders irrelevant and is not based on debt. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:06:57
Awww missed this round!! Ugh i was hoping for a few more weeks to get the 9 more coins in needed. Hopefully Ill get batch 4 but If anyone is willing to pool funds to spread risk let me know.

Bitcoin isnt a bubble. Its not a stock. Its not a company with clients and profit margins and shareholders. Holders of bitcoin do not get dividend payments. 
Bitcoin is an open-source beta economic experiment. The value of the coin is irrelevant to the idea itself. 
I do hope the minds driving this ship are not destroyed by the emotions behind large amounts of money. Slow and steady boys.

One does not simply cash out of Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-03-08 09:38:07
Yeah its filled with rediculous misinformation I dont have the energy or desire to explain why. 
@_date: 2013-03-02 06:03:52
It may be too late but when I don't want to pay bit instant fees I use bitfloor. They use local till. It requires you to go to a bank of America branch with cash and fill out a deposit slip. Your Money will be in your bitfloor account in 10-15 mins

Did Kim DotCom's tweet do this? Someone just dropped a million dollar transaction

Bitcoin is beta open source software. We are only at Bitcoin 0.8. 
If it were commercial software, it wouldnt be released yet. Even without a reliable infrastructure it still hit highs of $266
Give it time, or become a developer yourself.

This was the most painful thing to me. It would have made a huge difference as Im moving and getting married. 
Had 2k in cash on gox, thought I had an easy arbitrage opportunity with bitfloor, buy 45 BTC, send to bitfloor, 30 min later, fork.....
If I just left it on gox Id have the living room set, and the bedroom set instead of a chair. People who had cash on gox and were awake made a killing.

Are you holding? 
@_date: 2013-03-08 09:58:41
Actually you can fund a bitfloor account in 15 minutes through local till. Its easy cheaper than bitinstant. Its pretty trivial to buy some coins after that. Bitfoor even pays you a small fee if you learn how to place  limit orders. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 06:57:04
Id probably use them again if a major bank had their fisync connection, they are very low cost . Until then Ill just stick with Localtill-bitfloor or coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-03-08 09:41:39
Don't worry about it. Ach verification is slow. They are probably busy. It took a few days for me too. Bitfloor Is a great site. Never had any issues. Local till deposit is fast and cheap. Much easier to fund for me than gox

Sold all 90 earlier in the week at 41. Will rebuy 90 when the price dips to the low 30s. I will invest what I can for the forseeable future. Its too good of an idea.

Ill smoke one in your honor.

Write me a bitcoin trading platform that interfaces with Gox and btc-e and has single file snap-ins to add trading bots.

Bitcoin Is still young. As the software matures it will be harder make a mistake. If you really weren't sure you could set up an escrow transaction. I'm sure as services improve. Some form of transaction insurance will be offered by people.

Is the bid on the opening page still standing? 118.80?

I work in an IT department and I was the only one who saw Bitcoin for what it was. My manager would dig up the hack stories or the blog stories saying it was a pyramid scheme and send me one every few days. I would just casually walk by his office and go BTW Bitcoin at 20. Buy some. I knew this guy has enough for a down payment for a house in the bank. He laughed at me. Id go 25 now, he'd go yah, Ponzi! 40, 50, 70, now 100. He shut up around 90$ Im just trying to help my co-workers. If just one other guy was into it like I was I would have invested much more when it was 11. The negative social signals really hurt my confidence. Mind you, BTC paid for my apartment and my honeymoon, but had I had the confidence earlier in 2012 it would be totally life changing by now.

Pics or it didnt happen.
@_date: 2013-03-12 06:40:00
I dont use them anymore because of the delay, but its not really their fault, they are at the mercy of ACH transfers. Which in itself is a catalyst for the creation of something like bitcoin
