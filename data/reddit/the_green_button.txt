First Diversify don't put all you want to invest into one coin! Second know-one really knows if a coin will go up or down. BTC has only gone up and up (Really i no it said 19K for an hour but it was 5K a month ago and won't go below 12.7K-13K now i'm sure it will go up to 15K by the 31st Jan. I'm trying out XLM as my main alt atm it has a lot of potential but so do load of ALTs

Yes you have an account already though your coinbase account.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:31:56
Use Gdax for now as you also have an account with them though Coinbase (They charge next to no fees). If you want to use a different exchange set up and get verified before you switch over since it can take weeks right now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:24:46
But why? like why are you waiting until you have lost money for sure and then selling how is that your plan?
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:45:27
I just read Bitcoin is down 10.96% on the week, like people are losing their shit because it's down 10.96%. it's been 40% on a month before and rose bigger and bigger than ever.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:56:20
Nah theirs no money in it any more the Russians have taken over.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:47:40
GDAX is free and you already have na account!
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:14:16
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:49:10
Don't Sell HODL i'm guessing you planned on Holding for a while anyway while it rose? Just don't look for 30 days it will be higher than it is now by far 19K maybe not but 14.5K-17K Easy. Then just keep holding until it's at your Moon unless you need than money to live and over invested. Then sell what you need to so that you are ok. Then think about what your willing to risk next time!

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:40:39
You are right time in the market is better than timing the market.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:07:16
Don't suppose you could PM the links you sent please? i'm new and would love to read up as much as i can!  
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:58:00
At least the wall is over and it should stop about now.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:40:06
It’s fee if you use GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:34:04

@_date: 2017-12-28 20:54:08
Buy direct and pay shipping they shipped mine in like 4 days. ( it charges in Euros just work out the exchange with postage it was £75.43
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:58
This SEPA delay is killing me!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:05:35
No the same as before ALT coins being shilled. Goes round and round.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:15
Their will be many days where everyone is screaming and shouting this has happened time and time again. HODL &lt;&lt;&lt; DO that! and try to not look to much at the moment unless you plan to buy more as low as you dare wait.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:30:59
FUD here get your FUD here.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:35:08
Yes but this SEPA delay was scary lucky mine went in this mourning :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:28:26
You can do it fee free on GDAX!!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:35:07
NO! buying the ATH is not recommended. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:14:46
The poor folks who just bought BCash for $9000 this is how stories of people losing their home happen.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:08:41
I'm new too, i'm using Coinbase i think they charge a lot but it's simple and clearly works well. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:46:56
Fuck i bought a little not a lot still happy to watch it go back upppppppp
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:46:47
Hugh buy orders are flying in!!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:32:31
I've done very similar too you but started a little while longer ago than you. I've been 10% down right after starting then 5% up 10% down etc. Currently i'm dealing with going from 80% up to 40% up it's a lot nicer. Just Hold really thats all you need to do now stop looking until January 31st because this up and down won't help you by looking at it it will just annoy you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:20:43
You get to HODL without being able to slip up, when you have it cleared and are up or nearly back to break even don't give in. Maybe meme advice isn't what we should all follow but this is still early days come 2027 you could have increased 5000%. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:45:22
well you can set a "limit" price on Gdax to buy a certain amount only if it falls to a certain price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:19:51
HODL it's time in the market not timing the market. One day hopefully not too late 2018 you will wish you could buy at 18.9K
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:59:20
Now it is?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:16:17
If i invest any more i will. Thanks!     Also....... are Ethereum &amp; Litecoin worth looking into or are they just trying to lure you into buying knock off currency?
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:10:19
