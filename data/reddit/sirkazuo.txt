Second outlier here.  I think bitcoin's only use as a currency is in the drug trade.  Everything else is speculative investing.  If a different currency pops up that becomes the preferred internet drug money, I'd drop BTC in a heartbeat just because the only thing left holding it up would be hopes and dreams.

3 hours and counting!  Mods are asleep.  
Everyone get in here!  
Bitcoin Cash is the true Bitcoin, when Core blocks 2X in November a substantial majority of miners are going to leave Core for Cash, causing the Core network to stagnate and have even higher fees on top of extremely slow block times despite whatever the non-mining user nodes want, causing a chain reaction that hits the mass media and sends everyone scrambling to jump ship except the die-hard small-blockers.

It's deflationary by design.  There is a maximum number of bitcoins that can ever be created.  Once 21 million bitcoins are mined, no more ever come into circulation.  Even if you ignore the variables of world population, interest, etc. you have to accept that losing access to a cryptographically secured wallet is actually quite easy. 
 Hundreds of thousands of bitcoins have been lost already and some non-zero percentage of bitcoins will continue to be lost and removed from circulation every year, reducing the amount of coins available and inducing deflation if demand stays constant.
Honestly this maximum number of bitcoins has always stuck me as a bit like the whole "we will never need more than 4 billion IPv4 addresses" issue.  Perhaps somewhat shortsighted.  But I suppose the option is always there to just refactor and release another 21 million in 50 years or something.  Bitcoin Quantitative Easing.  But then that sort of defeats the whole ethos.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:01:29
Not OP, but for me the fundamental concept of BTC as a currency just doesn't add up long-term.  A currency needs to be slightly inflationary to encourage people to circulate it.  If a "currency" is guaranteed deflationary by design &amp;mdash; that is the value *always* rises &amp;mdash; then no one will want to spend it or invest it or lend it, because why would you spend something that will be worth more tomorrow if you don't have to?  My USD is inflationary so I invest it instead of hoarding it.
Investment and lending are the bread and butter of a functioning modern economy.  If the people and institutions that hold the most wealth are disincentivized to lend it the economy grinds to a halt.  Which means that if BTC is going to stick around it's going to continue to be only as a speculative commodity and payment platform (a la Visa/PayPal/etc.) like it is today, and not as a currency, since the currency shoes *must* be filled by inflationary fiat so long as we still need a functioning monetary economy.
To be clear I think a deflationary currency could be viable if it was the *only* currency choice, because then everyone is locked in to the same background deflation and you could still make even more money by lending/investing.  This is how the usual Austrian economic rebuttal to the problem of deflation works.  In a world where everyone is tied to the same level of deflation, the cycle is closed and it doesn't matter.  But if I have the *choice* to lend/invest USD or BTC, what incentive do I have to lend BTC and save USD?  There is none.  As long as there is an inflationary fiat still in existence and viable (and there always will be) then BTC can never usurp it/them as a true currency.
As a payment platform, blockchain in general is the superstar as Bitcoin in particular doesn't have much that puts it above any other blockchain implementation except the first-mover advantage in that there are more institutions/exchanges built around Bitcoin that allow you to convert and send fiat quickly and easily.  That's not a guarantee of success though mostly because the cost for institutions/exchanges to adopt new cryptos is significantly lower than the cost to start up in the first place.  I'm 50-50 on whether Bitcoin itself sticks around as the payment platform chain of choice for wealth transfers or gets usurped at some point, personally.
So that just leaves speculation, which is the one thing that Bitcoin is undoubtedly the king of, and in which it will probably be the first, last, and only one of its kind.

I do, but I don't bank with a bank.  Not a whole lot though you're right, like half a percent.  Checking account is for extremely stable liquidity though, not for returns.  People take the loss on the APR in order to guarantee their money will be available and easy to access when they need it.  Returns = risk, and I don't want my checking account to be risky at all.  If I kept my rent money in BTC or forex or something and then there was a dip the day I had to pay rent and I came up $600 short, that would be a pretty big problem...  
If you think BTC (or anything) can somehow guarantee great returns *and* great stability and liquidity for your grocery money then I've got a bridge to sell you...

True!  That would probably be the best way to deal with the issue; you'd have to change the denominations that people use but it would still be mathematically sound.  It's not a permanent, forever, infinity solution, because you will eventually reach a point where you have to divide again, and again, and again, until you've got the whole solar system operating on fractions of the few bitcoins that haven't been lost yet.  But I suppose that's a bit of an ambitious time scale to be worrying about.

That's not the same logic at all.  If I am a rich person or a bank and I have lots of wealth and access to *both* USD and BTC, which one do I choose to invest with?  
If I invest in the S&amp;P 500 with BTC, I'm losing a baseline of (let's just say) 6% growth (what BTC would have earned me due to deflation alone, ignoring the massive speculation growth) but gaining 10% from the stock market, so my choice to invest with BTC has netted me a 4% return in total.  You have to lose the 6% growth while your investment is maturing because the S&amp;P 500 doesn't operate in Bitcoin, it operates in Dollars.  This point is crucial.
If I instead choose to invest in the S&amp;P 500 with USD, I'm losing a baseline of -2% growth (what USD would have lost me due to inflation alone) and gaining 10% from the stock market, so my choice to invest with USD has netted me an effective 12% return vs doing nothing.
This is a simplified explanation, but even still it's clear to see that if you have BOTH currencies available to you, USD is obviously the better tool to lend and invest with, so I will lend and invest with my Dollars, and save/hoard my Bitcoins.
Back to that crucial point.  If the whole world was only operating in Bitcoins then none of this would matter at all, because everyone would be on the same level playing field and economic decisions would play out rationally and you could invest in the Bitcoin500 and take back not only your market gains but also your deflation gains once the investment had matured.  But because Bitcoin is not the *only* currency, and every American *must* have Dollars to pay taxes and bills etc. then Bitcoin will never be the smart decision to lend and invest with, which in a bit of circular reasoning, means it can never usurp the Dollar as a currency.

A lender needs a borrower and a borrower needs a lender.  Who in their right mind would take a loan out in BTC knowing that they'd borrow $1,000 today and have to pay back $20,000 next year if they didn't have to?
Deflation is perhaps better for lenders and worse for borrowers, and inflation vice versa, but that's not the point because Bitcoin doesn't exist in its own little bubble apart from fiat.  The point is to consider how the system works where you have one deflationary currency and one inflationary currency that exist side by side.  Bitcoin only works as a currency in a society where it is the *only* currency, and it can't *be* the only currency until it actually works as a currency.

Losses from inflation on the $3k in a checking account is like $3 per month depending on inflation and what interest rate your banking institution pays for deposits in your checking account.
I mean $36/yr is definitely something, but I wouldn't exactly call it "significantly wealth" &amp;mdash; certainly not if you're well enough off to be floating $3k in checking.

You've got it backwards.  Inflation is what you get when you add more money to the supply and prices for things go up, meaning each unit of currency is worth less.
Deflation is what you get when you remove money from the supply (or increase demand for a fixed supply) and each unit of currency is worth more, meaning prices for things tend to go down or stay flat.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:39:56
Absolutely.  That's 95% of what Bitcoin is right now, and probably what it always will be.  
Gold is a commodity investment and it operates much the same way that Bitcoin does as an investment vehicle, except the price of gold tends to be much more stable and returns are often not guaranteed at all.  People invest in gold *because* the price is very stable and probably won't go too far up or down even if their other investments do.  
Real Estate is more similar to Bitcoin in the sense that people expect real estate investments to generally appreciate over time faster than inflation and make them some money, even though there is some risk involved.
As investments go, gold is very safe but not very profitable.  Real estate is reasonably safe, and reasonably profitable.  Bitcoin is extremely profitable, but also extremely unsafe (volatile) so it should be treated as a minority position in most sane investment portfolios depending on your own level of risk aversion (and how young and willing to make potentially bad decisions you are.)

I don't know if you realize it, but what you're implying is that BTC is only viable as a currency if people are forced to use it.  Because if I have a choice between inflationary or deflationary currency, it makes no sense to spend the deflationary currency if I don't have to.

Same as I said to the other guy, this scenario only makes sense in a world where I can *only* spend BTC.
In this world, I can choose to spend BTC or to spend USD to eat or buy a cell phone.  Why should I trade an asset which appreciates over time (BTC) for one that depreciates over time (the cell phone), when I can instead trade a depreciating asset (cash) for it instead?  It just doesn't make sense to spend BTC on goods and services.
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:16:32
The latter.  Imagine you have 10 coins and they're worth $1 each - the market cap is $10.  Someone wants to buy a coin from you, but you don't want to sell.  He offers you $2 instead, so you sell him a coin.  Now the coins are worth $2 each, and the market cap has doubled to $20, even though only $2 was invested in coins during this time.

Because losing a small amount of money to inflation by holding cash is a worthwhile trade in order to maintain liquidity in day to day life.  I could go to a bank every day and deposit my pocket change into an investment account and take it back out again the next morning, but the amount of effort there is obviously not worth it, so I accept the loss.
Anyway, the argument in favor of BTC as a currency only makes sense in a world where BTC is the *only* currency.  If all of my income and savings and investments etc. are in BTC then there's no reason not to spend it and there's no reason to convert it to USD first.  But if I still live in a world where I have both USD and BTC, it doesn't make sense to convert the USD to BTC before spending it (which probably requires converting it back to USD anyway), and it doesn't make sense to spend BTC when I have USD on hand to spend instead.
Basically BTC only works as a currency if you're 100% all-in on BTC, if you have no spare USD left over, because if you do have cash on hand you need to spend that first.  BTC cannot become a successful currency until it is already a successful currency.

After some more recent reading it turns out I was mistaken.  I was mis-remembering research that applied only to flash memory that is *end of life*, which is specifically flash memory that has already reached it's read/write limit (typically 5,000ish for MLC you find on little flash drives and small devices like this).  In that case, after 3-6 months depending on ambient temperature you can expect unpowered flash memory to lose data, however this doesn't apply to *new* flash memory that has not yet reached end of life.  
Much less to worry about, unless you do a lot of read/write activity on the device.  Basically, the more you use it, the more likely it is to die because you left it in a drawer for too long, with the worst case scenario only being in the 3-6 month range.

It's called the 'spot price', and in a small nutshell it's the price at which a commodity can be bought or sold for immediate delivery.  
Each exchange has its own spot price &amp;mdash; though they're usually almost identical due to arbitrage &amp;mdash; and some major players such as [bitpay]( and [coindesk]( have developed more elaborate algorithms to determine the most accurate exchange rate by (essentially) taking an average of all the major exchanges' spot prices.

They are about evenly priced with the ASICMiner 10GH/s blades that have been auctioned off/sold, on the upper end of the auction prices but still equivalent.
They are overpriced compared to BFL units which are not shipping until probably 2014 at the earliest (if ever), and they are overpriced compared to Avalon ASICs which are not shipping in any reasonable numbers, and they are overpriced compared to GPU miners **when** you don't have to pay for electricity.
Personally I live in SoCal and pay $0.21/kWh for electricity, which makes GPUs completely unprofitable when you add in the cost of running the CPU and motherboard to support PCI-e cards plus the cost of cooling the enormous heat they put out.  
A USB ASIC like this one is actually profitable on a daily basis, even if it doesn't ever return its initial cost (which it still might!)  But most importantly, this is the only ASIC device that is actually shipping when you purchase it.
*Edit:  Turns out I actually pay $0.27/kWh at peak, but it's a tiered pricing structure so I currently pay an average of about $0.16/kWh, however any additional wattage I add to my bill (for example by spinning up a new mining rig) is charged at the current highest tier so for the purposes of mining my rate is $0.27/kWh.*

To be fair it is crap math - you're making assumptions about *all* of the data.  90% of the order book might be in the first week, might be in the last week, you can't extrapolate the current rate if you have no idea how many they're doing per day and how many they need to do and what the order book distribution is like.
But with that said, I fully expect they only have one, maybe two guys assembling and packaging devices and maybe one guy shipping them, and I can't fathom that they're doing more than 50 per day during 9-to-5 business hours, so I agree that September will never happen.

I'm not changing my point at all.  Clean drug money is still drug money, but if it's laundered properly then nobody knows it's drug money, so it becomes clean money.  That's the whole point of laundering.
I'm not saying that attorneys won't take drug money on moral principle, it's just that if they get paid with drug money and it comes to light, they'll get that money taken from them at the least, so they go to great lengths to make sure the money they're getting is clean and they won't get in trouble for getting involved in it.

I agree that the curve we're seeing is unsustainable, but I do think ~20-30% is the new norm until back orders of ASIC miners are shipped complete.  Right now people are getting back ordered miners that are no longer going to even break even on purchase price, but they're still bringing them online because hey, they already paid for them so why not?  I suspect that will continue to happen until BFL is shipped complete on pre-orders at least, not to mention all of the existing group buys and pre-orders that have already been paid for at other companies like Avalon and BitFury et al.
As long as people keep placing pre orders and believing in fanciful two-week™ ship dates the difficulty will continue to rise somewhere around this rate of at least 20-25%, at least that's my opinion on the psychology of it.  You have to remember that these are not all informed market players - a *lot* of them are making economic sacrifices just because they like bitcoin.
Edited to add: GPU miners going offline isn't going to make much of a dent in it.  Just look at [the graphs]( - GPU miners only account for the segment under the line before ASICs started coming online.  Even if every last one of them goes offline it will account for less than half of our last difficulty adjustment.

Are you ready for this?  I'm about to drop some insider knowledge on you.  
Manwin uses a Southern Californian company called [Netbilling]( for most if not all of their online payment processing and repeat billing.  Netbilling is itself a white-label of a big payment processing software solution provider known as [Ezic]( - that is to say, they just change the logos on Ezic's software.  (Incidentally, Netbilling serves the prominent majority of all porn sites on the internet for payment processing needs, so they would be the place to target really.)
Manwin would love BTC payment processing because of the lack of charge backs, as charge backs are a huge problem for porn sites owing to the massive amount of fraud going on in that world daily.  With that said, Manwin, Netbilling, and Ezic are all run by old men with little or no skin in the internet business.  They're golfers who employ internet people, and couldn't care less about BTC as long as their accounts keep getting deposits.
You've got a long, long road to walk, but if you attack all three of those vectors at once you might generate some traction.

The number they're shipping now is as near as makes no difference to 0 as far as I'm concerned.  Glad some other guy is getting his unit, but if I can't get one for 6-12 months it doesn't really count.
The first AM auction had blades go for considerably more than these things cost actually.
The USB blockerupter is the only ASIC option shipping now in a quantity that means a buyer can buy one and receive it within a couple weeks to a month, for anyone that doesn't want to spend &gt; $6,000 on a piece of hardware.
It may not return its investment soon, or ever, but there's no real competition in this market segment.

I asked for sources, you provided none, so if you add them all up...
Assumption: AM, Avalon, and BFL are the only people adding hashing power to the network.  
Assumption: AM pays dividends based on fiat hardware sales not converted to BTC.  
Assumption: AM's next dividend will be 0.015.  
Assumption: AM is honest and accurate in their bookkeeping.  
Assumption: AM's only contribution to the network is from hardware sold.  
Assumption: Avalon's only contribution to the network is from chips reported as sold.  
Assumption: Bitfountain isn't just giving loads of ASIC chips to another private subsidiary off the AM books.
The only fact (singular!) you have in your post is AM's last dividend price, and no data at all to link that to anything of value except assumptions!  That's not "math", that's hand-waving.
Clearly you didn't understand what "Sources or you're just making shit up" means.

The price change of BTC makes no difference to mining profitability really for the very reason you stated - even if BTC is suddenly worth $500 next month it doesn't make the mining process any more profitable, it just makes BTC more profitable.

The issue is the economic concept of opportunity cost.  When you spend money to purchase a miner, you're not only losing the money that you spent, you're losing the opportunity to spend that money on something else.  Ergo, when you make the decision to spend money on the miner, you're making that decision with the expectation that you'll make more money back than you put in (unless your motivation is something other than profit of course) and with the expectation that this is the most profitable decision available for the amount of risk you're willing to take.
If I spend money on a miner with the expectation that the future value of a bitcoin will be the source of my profits, I've made a poor economic decision because purchasing bitcoin directly will guarantee I see those profits without any overhead from mining.  If I spend money on a miner with the expectation that the miner and the mining process itself will be the source of my profits, I've made a wise economic decision, because if I spent the money on something else (i.e. Bitcoin currency) I would not have made as much profit.

$/Mh is useful, but so is Mh/W
A 330 MH/s GPU at 200W is roughly equivalent to a 140 MH/s miner if you're paying SoCal rates for electricity.
A 330 MH/s ASIC at .5W is roughly equivalent to... a 330 MH/s miner.
Compare this one stick to roughly 3x 200W 300MH/s GPU miners, once you factor in electricity at the rates I pay.

If the price crashes after you buy currency, you're out of luck.  Makes no difference in the choice between them at the time of purchase.


Almost.  The profit from mining is a function of a lot of things like network difficulty, efficiency, and hashing power. The price can be $0.01 per bitcoin, but if difficulty is so low that you can make 10,000 bitcoins per day then you're making a profit.  The price can be $1000 per bitcoin, but if difficulty is at 1bn and you're making 0.00001 bitcoins per day it probably costs more to run the miner than you're making, at least with current equipment.
Mining will only be better than holding currency when you expect the miner will be able to create more bitcoins than you paid for it.
@_date: 2013-05-29 00:56:12
Yeah, unfortunately.  I would still like to mine and contribute some small amount to the hash power of the network even if it isn't profitable for me though, as long as it doesn't cost me an arm and a leg to operate.  The USB ASIC option makes this actually viable for once, and even if it may not be profitable in the long run at least it won't drain money from me every day.

Actually the second blade auction had one person bid/buy for an amount higher than the current USB costs as well. :p
And my math may be wrong, but the USB is 330 MH/s for 1.99 BTC which comes out to 6.03 BTC per GHash, and the blades are 10GH/s for 49.99BTC, which is 4.99 BTC per GHash.  The difference in cost then is only 1.04 BTC, or roughly 21% more expensive than the blades.
A 21% markup for the convenience of a USB package plus the additional cost of having an entire PCB just for one little ASIC chip does not strike me as too terrible for what it is.  It's clearly not a rack-mounting number-crunching developers-only $15,000 Avalon box designed for immediate ROI and instant free money - it's a convenient, low effort, low heat, low electricity consumer product.

I'm seeing Newegg showing that card for $144.99 after $25.00 rebate, but fair enough, that's still cheaper than I was expecting.
Also, I do own a PC already, but there's two flaws with using my existing PC for mining.  First, my existing PC is a behemoth capable of drawing a massive amount of watts and putting out a massive amount of heat, and running it 24/7 for mining would be prohibitively expensive, as you argue yourself!  "But just run it when you would be using it anyway!" you cry, but I only use my desktop at home like 3-4 hours a day at most on week days, and most of the time for gaming where I'd have the miner turned off anyway.  Having a separate low-power machine to sit in a closet or on the balcony would be ideal.
The other half of it is that saying "oh well just use your existing hardware" in a bare metal cost comparison is an unfair advantage for the GPU.  A computer with a PCI-e slot *is* a requirement for GPU mining, so not including it and lumping it in with a nebulous "other expenses, don't worry about them" category seems a bit disingenuous to me, even if it is the reality in many cases.
Also for the record, my average electricity rate at the moment is about $0.16/kWh due to the way SoCal Edison does tiered pricing, but because any additional wattage I add to my monthly usage at this point would be billed at the tier I'm currently in, the cost of adding a new mining rig for me is currently $0.27/kWh.  And at any rate I live in an apartment so I can't really install a generator or solar PV anyway (though I would do solar, electricity out here is shit expensive the greedy cunts.)

Yeah unfortunately NVidia has not put nearly as much effort into developing the drivers for processing things other than graphics that AMD has.  An equivalent brand new AMD card would hash several times more than the NVidia card, but even the best card that AMD has to offer is not profitable anymore, so don't feel too bad.  The ASIC explosion has made BTC mining a hobby for fun, but definitely no longer for any sort of profit, at least at current values.
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:14:52
I'm not saying it's a guaranteed profit - there's very few things in life that are a guaranteed profit.  But considering it requires zero effort and even if the value tanked and the difficulty skyrocketed you'd still be a productive part of the mining network without the need to run a giant furnace array of GPUs - why wouldn't you want to be a part of that?  
Even if in three months that number drops to -1 cents a day, at $4.57 a day you still made $400 in the meantime, and now you're just helping the network out.  If your estimate of $5 is accurate, it pays for itself in two months.

Show me some numbers.  
People that bought GPUs in 2011 probably did make a profit on average because difficulty was low and flat enough that they were able to make more bitcoin than they paid for the equipment.  I'm not saying mining is never profitable, don't get me wrong.
Have first batch Avalons made more bitcoin than they cost by now?  I'm guessing yes, at least for the very first batch like the one that jgarzik got.  In that case they too were profitable investments, more so than buying currency would have been.

I agree.
If difficulty continues to rise at its current rate, the only profitable miner is one that costs less than 10 cents per MH/s *right now*, and that price has to drop at the same speed that difficulty rises to remain profitable, which currently means 10 cents per MH today, 8 cents in two weeks, 5 cents in two months, etc.  That means anyone that bought a BFL unit even at the original cheap prices will make zero profit unless they get their unit online within the next 3 months.  At current prices BFL units' window for profitability shrinks down to the next month and a half.  
The USB BlockErupter would have to cost $33 or less to be profitable right now, $21 or less to be profitable at this time next month, and so on.
That's not to mention this is completely ignoring the cost of electricity too, this is strictly what the miner is capable of producing in its lifetime due to network difficulty.
Obviously difficulty can't continue to go up 20% every two weeks forever, but as long as it does the price per MH has to continue falling to remain profitable, and right now there are no in-stock profitable miners.

While true, mining won't become profitable when that happens.  As long as there is *any* profit to be made where people have to do nothing at all but plug a computer in, there will be people doing it.  And as long as people are doing it, difficulty will rise, and continue to rise, until there is no longer any profit left in doing it.  
If mining stabilizes one day, it will be at a point very near to where mining nets zero profits.  And in my opinion, it will be slightly into the negative profits, because there will always be some people who are Bitcoin purists who will continue to operate a node for altruistic reasons, and there will always be people operating nodes because they're running a Bitcoin business that necessitates it, and there will always be people operating miners with negative efficiency because their parents or boss or school pays for electricity, and there will always be people with cheaper electricity rates than you.

It actually is completely silent while encrypting, and doesn't affect local OS files, so even if users reported that documents and files on network shares were inaccessible you'd have no quick way of knowing which one of your users machines was the one infected.  
You may have the knowledge of how to do a RAM dump on a hostile program which almost certainly has protections in place and then parse that data to find the 2048-bit encryption key, but that's certainly not a common skill, not by a long shot.  1 in a million, maybe 1 in 10 million, or more.
Of course you should plan to restore anyway because there's no guarantee that it will work, and in a corporate environment with intelligent admins and best-practice backup and restore strategies across 100% of your affected data this is all moot, but that too is pretty rare...

NVidia cards are not too good at BTC mining.

That of course is not counting the cost of electricity.  If you're paying for electricity yourself you will be paying more to the power company than you will be making in BTC unfortunately.

My average cost at the moment is actually about $0.162/kWh due to the tiered pricing structure.  However any additional wattage (for example a new mining rig) would be charged at my current tier, which is $0.27/kWh, so that's my cost for mining purposes but not necessarily for overall living.

Given the constantly and astronomically increasing network hash rate, you will almost certainly never make back the $100 you spent on the miner in the first place.
Difficulty increases roughly every two weeks, and it just went up by 20%.  If we extrapolate using this current trend, this is what your miner will generate:
|Week|BTC Mined|Total  |
|1	|0.0371	|0.0371|
|2	|0.0371	|0.0742|
|3	|0.0297	|0.1039|
|4	|0.0297	|0.1336|
|5	|0.0237	|0.1573|
|6	|0.0237	|0.1810|
|7	|0.0190	|0.2000|
|8	|0.0190	|0.2190|
|9	|0.0152	|0.2342|
|10	|0.0152	|0.2494|
|11	|0.0122	|0.2616|
|12	|0.0122	|0.2737|
Bear in mind this doesn't account for electricity costs either, but I'm guessing if $100 is a large chunk of your paycheck you probably live with family or in a dorm where electricity is free for you anyway.  Anyway as you can no doubt see, if the hash rate continues to increase at its current rate the coins generated will continue to go down and I can tell you that if I extend this to its conclusion, in 146 weeks it will be generating 0 BTC per week and the total coins mined will only be 0.371, which is quite a bit less than the 1.000 paid for it.

GPU miners made a fortune?
How did they make that fortune?  They made it because the value of bitcoin skyrocketed and they had some already.  If you had bought the same amount of bitcoin that they had in 2012, you would have made an even bigger fortune, because you wouldn't have paid for the capital or upkeep on the miners.  
The only point at which buying mining equipment is more profitable than buying currency is when that miner generates more bitcoin than you paid for it, regardless of bitcoin's current value.

Consider the following: Tens of thousands of people placed orders for ASIC mining hardware back in April during the last major news bubble when everyone was running around screaming 'free money'.  Those pre-orders are only now being shipped, and they (BFL mostly, but there are plenty of others) will continue to be shipping very old back-orders for many months to come.
Consider that people make impulsive decisions to pre-order with today's money, because their expected delivery date gives them an imagined profit.  The company doesn't deliver on time, and when they do receive their miner it's no longer profitable as an investment.
But what do they do?  Of course they're still going to bring it online and mine with it, now that they've waited so long for it.  They won't care that it isn't profitable at the moment.  It's an emotional decision, not a logical one.
You're also hinging your argument on the idea that people are logical players and that they'll only mine for a real profit.  What's actually happening is people are mining for an *expected* or *imagined* profit, precisely *because they've done the math wrong*.
Of course you're right that the exponential curve can't last forever, but I suspect it will continue until the industry catches up on all of its back-orders from the last year and supply comes more or less in line with demand.

This is a bad idea in my experience.  I tried it twice - the first time I assumed the check was lost in the mail after two weeks and stopped payment.  The second time the check was cashed after about 2 weeks but nothing was ever posted to my account.  10 days after the check was cashed I finally got through to the support department who credited my account the money and closed the ticket.  My account name and email were printed clearly on the check.

At that price if difficulty continues to rise at its current rate the device will actually be incapable of making back its cost in BTC unless you get it hashing within the next month, making it a complete loss.
The only profitable miner is one that costs less than 10 cents per MHash right now, or 6.5 cents per MHash in a month, etc.  
There is no currently commercially available miner that will turn a profit if bought or pre-ordered today, unless difficulty increases slow drastically, and soon.

That's why I was suggesting a calculator that offers a "profit decline per year" modifier.  That modifier will correctly predict the slope of decline over a year.  The calculator I linked to will help you get the right constant to plug in to one of those other calculators for a given guess of how much each diff increase will be.  For example, if you think difficulty will continue to increase by 30% every 2016 blocks, that calculator I linked will give you roughly 0.00000558.  Plug this number into the "profit decline per year" box and the calculator will correctly estimate your number of days to break even based on the constantly increasing difficulty that you estimated.
It is basically the same thing as TGB's calculator though in the end.

My point was that the tone of the comment strongly lionized the SR establishment as an innocent marketplace which just happened to contain drugs and other state-labeled-contraband as well as everything else one might expect on an open market, but that's a disingenuous picture of things at best.  SR was a market for drugs which occasionally had other things for sale, as evidenced by the fact that the drug section held 95% of their listings and was the default front-page category.
I don't think the fact that it was a drug market challenges the ideals of free trade between consenting adults, I just think that comments like this, taken as a whole, are misguided at best and misleading at worst.  DPR was not a class act, he tried to have people murdered, and I strongly doubt that in the end he was making those decisions for altruistic reasons.  He was protecting himself, and the establishment that made him millions of dollars a year.  That much is debatable, but any look at human nature will show that true martyrs are *exceptionally* rare.
In short, I don't disagree with you - one's opinion of DPR shouldn't affect one's belief in his stated philosophy.  What I disagree with is the belief in the automatic truth of his words and the sainthood that some people are raising him to because of it.  I believe he's dying not for his belief in the right of individual freedom, but for running a worldwide underground drug market, taking profits from it, and conspiring to have people tortured and killed. 
He's not dying for the cause, he's dying for poor decisions, and to ignore that and build him into a martyr may be the best motivation you can ask for in a libertarian movement, but it's ignoring the truth in favor of a captivating fiction.

Their website currently says if you pre-order now your unit will ship in October, and if difficulty continues to rise at its current pace, by mid-October miners will have to cost less than 2.6 cents per mhash to be profitable, and by the end of October that number will be closer to 2 cents exactly, so it will be very close at best.  Not to mention expecting massive distribution to be ready in 2 months when they haven't shipped anything to my knowledge is pretty optimistic.
And that's not even including the cost of electricity at all, that's just what the device can theoretically mine before its hashing power becomes obsolete by the network.  Of course the hashing power of the network almost certainly can't keep increasing at its current rate forever.  The real question is how *long* will it keep increasing at its current rate?  Because if it keeps increasing at its current rate until at least the end of October, KNC miners will be a net loss as well, even with free electricity, as things stand today.

Personally I think their "valid business reasons" for keeping a lid on that is that they're vastly, vastly understaffed for the number of orders they have, and they want to keep the profit margin where it's at.

I agree, and don't forget in your assessment that there are still hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of pre-orders that BFL is shipping and will continue to ship probably for several more months.  People will be bringing those ASICs online *even though* they're not profitable at all, simply because they already paid for them, so why not?
This psychological factor alone will contribute a lot to pushing the network hashrate substantially higher than it is now in my opinion.

You wouldn't buy miners if the price crashed to 0 either though would you?  The price being 0 doesn't affect your decision to buy miners vs currency in that case, does it?

First of all, show me where I can buy a 7850 for $124.  Secondly, I disagree with hedging the price of the 7850 on its estimated CL sale value, since you can never guarantee that the GPU will be resalable or that anyone will actually pay your estimated price when that time comes.  Realistically the cost of a 7850 for mining is more like $180.
So let's take the cost difference between the 2BTC USB (more like 2.2 if you're just buying 1 because of the minimum order and group-buy fees) which at current rates is about $285 and the 7850.  
If we accept your cost for the 7850 at $75, the difference is $210, which would power the 130W card for about 249 days at my current SCE electricity cost ($0.27/kWh).  So that's 138 days of free mining vs. the blockerupter, which would net me about $262 over the cost of the GPU unless difficulty skyrockets in the next 249 days.
If, however, we take the real world cost of the 7850 at $180, and additionally include in our wattage calculation the power requirements for running a motherboard, CPU, ATX PSU, etc. as well as the cooling requirements in my apartment to balance out the several degrees of extra heat produced by running 24/7, we arrive at a cost difference of only $105 (assuming I already have a 24/7 machine to put the GPU in, which we shouldn't.)
If we also include the cost of the equipment needed to run the GPU/ASIC, we come into a much bigger difference - the GPU requires a mobo ($50), CPU ($30), RAM, ($20), and HDD ($10 flash drive) at minimum.  The USB ASIC requires a Raspberry Pi, ($35).  So now your total cost of setting up a GPU miner with a 7850 is $290, and your total cost of setting up a USB ASIC miner is $320.  The difference now is only $30.
The computer setup with the GPU running full tilt uses 130W for the GPU plus a conservative 60W for the rest, plus another conservative 50W in cooling to remove the heat from my apartment which brings you to somewhere around 240W.  Take away the 8W that the RPi + USB would use and your difference there is around 238W
The $30 difference now only lets me operate the GPU machine on "free" electricity for about 19 days, which would net me about -$179 in that time frame.

Man that was an old post haha.  But for the sake of argument, you're explaining *why* the sky is blue, but you're not refuting it.  
Even on another planet with a different gaseous atmosphere the sky would most likely still appear blue, because the most common gasses (nitrogen, oxygen, CO2, methane, hydrogen, etc.) are all around the same molecular size and would scatter blue light more or less the same as our own atmosphere.
If you still want to go all philosophical and say that it's not really blue it just *appears* blue, well, if you accept that then you must accept that *nothing* is really *any color*, all color is just perception, and then the sky can be neither blue nor not-blue, so the bet would be invalid!

Thanks!  I should clarify that it **is** entirely possible that the network power slows its mighty ascent soon enough to make these profitable after a while, but it's a hell of a gamble to make right now (for a tiny reward) in my opinion for two reasons:
1.  Economic psychology.  A huge number of people paid money over a year ago to pre-order miners, back when they were bright-eyed and had big hopes, but when time passes people forget about things and worry less about the profitability of their purchase.  That means there's going to be a ton of new miners just now shipping that are going to go online even though they're not profitable at all.  That means the hash rate will continue to climb *even though* there's nothing for sale that's profitable right now.  This to me is a big indicator that market-ready mining equipment will remain behind the curve of profitability for a while, at least until the elephant in the room, BFL, finishes shipping their back-orders.  And the other reason is:
2.  I forget the other reason.  But my general point is that you probably won't see the network level out in difficulty until the day that there are no more outstanding pre-orders for mining equipment and all of the major players are shipping stocked goods.  And that's not going to happen for a while, probably not until at least 2014.

It takes more effort to set up, has very little user-friendly documentation and few step by step tutorials, it requires a ton of HDD space that will grow unboundedly, it offers no smooth central user interface like the major pools do, it requires additional resources on the host computer, and to the miner whose only interest is profit it offers negligible if any benefits over using an existing pool.

How do you intend to verify identity without something like a linked bank account?
Stolen credit card information will pass AVS, CVV, and *can* pass IP geo-loc tests if the attacker is even moderately clever.  You can block high risk IPs, countries, and country IPs, but there are plenty of US VPNs that they'll use.  Banks don't typically store customer phone numbers, so that can be faked with a small amount of social engineering.  And this isn't even counting the number of people who will use *their own* credit info, smile and verify to your face, and then chargeback on you.

One of the problems I think is the major profitability calculators like the one on bitcoinx give a default value for profitability-decline that's absurd at the current rates.  Bitcoinx's calculator still defaults to .61 profitability decline, when the current average rate of increases over the last quarter suggest a constant much closer to .00008.  Plug that number into the 'profitability decline per year' box and see what your real chance of breaking even is - it's not high right now.
I made [a calculator]( to find a better constant for that profitability decline field, and the .61 number they default to suggests an average difficulty increase of less than 2% per re-adjustment, which is just absurd and misleading.

When you mine you're mining bitcoins, not USD.  Yes, if the exchange rate with USD goes up your BTC are now worth more, but that's a property of the coin, not the mining.  
If you want to gamble that the price of BTC will go up, what is the point in buying mining equipment in the first place?  If you're relying on BTC to be worth more later, just buy and hold BTC and you've realized the exact same profits, no mining required.  The *mining* didn't bring you those profits, ergo the exchange rate is economically irrelevant to the profitability of mining equipment.

Taxes are guaranteed demand for a currency, but that doesn't mean there's no demand for BTC as a decentralized anonymous electronic payment system.
Case in point, any number of anonymous underground goods and services websites that have been running for years with BTC.
I will concede that despite all of the romantic talk here, BTC is not a currency so much as a payment platform.  It has interesting caveats as a payment platform, in that it's not nominally tied to the value of the dollar, but since every good or service bought with BTC *is* tied with its value in USD it's not really a currency and likely never will be.  What it *is* though is an excellent anonymous payment platform.
I will concede that the only real demand for a platform like this comes from people wishing to transact value unattached from their name, ie. those with something to hide.  That may not necessarily mean just drugs and illegal goods, it might also mean services the collector wants to render without paying taxes on (the act of which is also illegal, but the goods might not be) or any other number of reasons which may be legit but most likely are not.
At any rate BTC is not well and truly over and likely won't be for a while, except in its aspirations of being a currency separated from USD.

I haven't seen one unfortunately, but if you're using the [bitcoinx calculator]( if you want to simulate what it will be like if difficulty continues to rise at 20% every two weeks forever, you would need to enter 0.00302231 in the "profitability decline per year" box.
Keep in mind this is assuming a 20% hash rate increase every interval for an entire 12 months, which is probably estimating too high.  Another example would be to say network speed increases at 20% per interval for, say, 6 months (I find this pretty plausible personally) and then increases by 10% per interval for the next 6 months, you could enter 0.01461814.

If you take the average of the last three months of increases (about 22% per increase) that's a roughly .00036131 profitability decline per year, which means that any mining hardware purchased after this coming difficulty increase has to cost less than $48 per GHash and be online and hashing immediately to ever break even, not counting electricity.  
If you instead take the 37% as the new normal increase, that gives a profitability decline per year of about 0.00000007, which means that any mining hardware purchased after the next difficulty jump has to cost less than a staggering $22 per GHash to ever break even, not counting electricity.  (That means USB Block Erupters at $7.25 or lower, hah!)
Of course difficulty could go down, but that seems less likely.

Not really.  Once you adjust for the exchange rate between BTC and your sovereign currency of choice any change in BTC value mined has nothing to do with the mining process.
Whether or not my 10 BTC are worth more tomorrow than today doesn't make the mining process more profitable.  If you bought a 1 BTC USB miner today and BTC rose to $500 tomorrow, you would have a lot more sovereign currency than you started with yes, but not due to mining, only due to the change in BTC value.  If you bought 1 BTC from someone else and held it for a day you would have the exact same profit.  That profit comes from the currency valuation, not the mining process.
@_date: 2013-08-02 22:29:35
The problem is that the network automatically adjusts itself when more people join in and bring more power online.  Every two weeks the network recalculates a 'difficulty' level that makes sure bitcoins continue to be generated only once every 10 minutes or so, even if a lot of hashing power is brought online.
Lately because of the emergence of ASIC miners into the network, the total network hashrate has been jumping by very large amounts, and the difficulty has risen accordingly.  The last jump, almost 2 weeks ago now, was 20% - that means each miner was instantly making 20% less than it was the 2 weeks prior.
If difficulty continues to rise at this rate or faster - and it's a fair guess that it will for some time since there are so many ASIC miner companies still in development and planning to ship and tons of pre-orders left outstanding - you have to calculate that your miners will make at least 20% less every two weeks until the network hashrate evens out or at least slows down.
At the current rate, only miners that cost less than ~8 cents per MHash/s will ever reach a break even point in their lifetime *at all*.  If the difficulty continues to rise so rapidly, returns will continue to diminish so fast that at some point in 3-6 months they will be generating such small amounts of bitcoin that they won't even be worth the electricity it takes to run them.
If you buy a miner right now for the purpose of profit, you will lose your money and you will be disappointed.  There is nothing available at the moment that will even break even, let alone make you a profit.
**tl;dr: No, it's not.**
