The premiere manufacturer of Bitcoin ATM’s has faced headwinds in recent weeks and the problem has only continued, leaving many within the Bitcoin community to predict an end to Robocoin. This has proven a considerable test for CEO founder Jordan Kelley.
People who come across Jordan Kelley might notice his bumptious persona and use of hip slang in his greetings at conferences. In many ways, he fits the bill of a entrepreneurial twenty-something millennial within the tech space, wearing thick black-rimmed glasses, tightly fittings jeans, collared shirts (often unbuttoned to show some skin) and sweaters. Other times he is dressed-to-the-nines in very nice suits.
As late though, Kelley’s company has faced some road bumps that could threaten what he has worked hard to build.
The article goes on to detail Robocoin refund issues, the robocoin 2.0, among other things.

Blake Benthall was arrested last week on suspicions of being the administrator of Silk Road 2.0, the darknet anonymous marketplace which took the place of Silk Road, for which Ross Ulbricht awaits trial on suspicions of running.
While running the website Silk Road 2.0, Benthall, who went by defcon on the website, was also apparently busy playing piano and recording in a studio, while professing his love for Jesus?

Peter Vessenes hasn’t exactly had an easy-go-of-it when it comes to his Bitcoin investments and involvement. Alongside the above-mentioned controversies surrounding Peter, allegations about CoinLab’s involvement in the Bitcoinica debacle have surfaced. When Coinlab made public its lawsuit of Mt. Gox, these two Reddit posts trended.
1. Open Letter to the Bitcoin Foundation: In Light Of Recent Events, Peter Vessenes’ Position As Executive Director Is Surely Now Untenable
2. Peter Vessenes just destroyed the credibility of the Bitcoin Foundation
Other than his involvement in some big disasters, Vessenes doesn’t share the same political views as many bitcoiners, oftentimes applauding government involvement in regulating bitcoin businesses with regulations that benefit “wealthy” players such as himself to the detriment of bitcoiners in lesser financial situations.  
“The U.S. put out guidance recently through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and we’ve been following up on that guidance and crushing bad actors,” Vessenes once said in an interview with CNBC Asia. “We’re seeing a bit of a sweep right now,” he said. “There’s nothing to indicate that good players who are working hard to stay regulated have anything to worry about.”
Despite the controversy, Vessenes has managed to appear on many mainstream news programs to represent the Bitcoin community and advertise his endeavors.  You can see some of his appearances here (in this video, Vessenes does not object to the host’s claim that The Bitcoin Foundation is “the closest thing to an authority” Bitcoin has) and here.
In 2013, as Vessenes’ image as a controversial character was only growing, members at BitcoinTalk held an impromptu survey. “Should Peter Vessenes resign as Executive Director for Bitcoin Foundation?” 72.3% said yes.

The article merely looks at "what's known" which admittedly is not much. But the article does not come to any conclusions...other than the data is inconclusive at best.

In the IB Times and other mainstream press outlets have made contentions  that your “smart” home could be hacked and used to mine bitcoins for a hacker’s benefit. But, considering the enormous amounts of GPU power and ASIC mining chips needed, it is unlucky that “hackers could target your toaster to mine bitcoins.”
As the IBTimes writes,
What is the Internet of Things?
The Internet of Things is a term used to describe interconnected devices, systems and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine communications.
Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, prophesied that appliances connected to the rapidly-growing Internet of Things could be manipulated by hackers to mine cryptocurrencies.
“Cryptocurrencies are interesting as they open up new opportunities [for hackers], like mining,” Hypponen said, speaking at the Slush startup conference in Helsinki on Tuesday (18 November).
“Attacks don’t target the user but the computer itself. Internet of Things devices can be hacked to mine cryptocurrencies and make money.”

Appliances that utilise internet connectivity, like smart toasters and smart refrigerators, present new opportunities for hackers(CC/ IBTimes UK)
Internet of Things devices have already been targeted by hackers to mine cryptocurrencies, but it is difficult to determine whether such practices are currently being carried out unless a security breach is actually detected.
In March Johannes Ullrich, an instructor at the SANS Technology Institute, discovered that a network of CCTV security cameras was infected with a malicious software that was mining dogecoin, the world’s third most valuable cryptocurrency.
While such software does not steal data or private information from users, it can dramatically affect the device’s performance due to the vast amounts of processing power required to mine altcoins.
“The internet really is changing everything but I do wonder where it’s going,” Hypponen said. “We’ve lived through a great revolution.
“It’s brought us so much good – like connectivity, new business and entertainment opportunities – but sometimes it does feel like we’ve built a monster.”
But toasters don’t have that much GPU’s. Just look at the computing power needed to mine bitcoins…

Peer-to-peer network the internet is not. A decentralized ledger the internet is not. A Digital math-based asset the internet is also not…

I thought it was interesting that less than a week after the space ship crashed, he is commenting on bitcoin regulation. A person he employed passed away. That is a big deal.  The mourning period hasn't passed, at least for the family I am sure. 
It just struck me as insensitive.  The post is related to bitcoin just in that he is calling for further regulation. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 07:04:28
could you explain how it is "the internet of money?"
@_date: 2014-11-05 00:15:41
I was thinking, this might dissuade "bitcoiners" from buying spaceship flights - that  he wanted to regulate bitcoin strictly. But then I thought combustible spaceships were probably enough.

I might have edited it a bit while you saw it. I had formatted it wrong...
1. The 7,500 Bitcoin Hard Drive
James Howells threw a hard drive with 7,500 bitcoins on it. He had mined them.
“You know when you put something in the bin, and in your head, say to yourself ‘that’s a bad idea’? I really did have that,” Howells, who works in IT, told the Guardian. “I don’t have an exact date, the only time period I can give – and I’ve been racking my own brains – is between 20 June and 10 August. Probably mid-July”.
When Howells threw the bitcoins away, they were worth £500,000.
“I’ve searched high and low. I’ve tried to retrieve files from all of my USB sticks, from all of my hard drives. I’ve tried everything just in case I had a backup file, or had copied it by accident. And … nothing.”
His visit to the landfill did not go well. “I had a word with one of the guys down there, explained the situation. And he actually took me out in his truck to where the landfill site is, the current ditch they’re working on. It’s about the size of a football field, and he said something from three or four months ago would be about three or four feet down.”
Howells stopped mining and stopped thinking about the bitcoins. “I hadn’t kept up on Bitcoin, I’d been distracted. I’d had a couple of kids since then, I’d been doing the house up, and forgot about it until it was in the news again.”
Howells considered retrieving the hard drive, but “even for the police to find something, they need a team of 15 guys, two diggers, and all the personal protection equipment. So for me to fund that, it’s not possible without the guarantee of money at the end.”
“There’s a pot of gold there for someone … I’m even thinking of registering  It’s available,” he said.
Howell also also set up a Bitcoin wallet for donations in order to recover the hard drive.
“If they were to offer me a share, fair enough,” he said. “If they were to go out and find it for themselves … it’s my mistake throwing the hard drive out, at the end of the day.”
The Newport council said that “obviously, if it was easily retrieved, we’d return it.”
Howell is content with the reality.
“I’m at the point where it’s either laugh about it or cry about it,” Howells says. “Why aren’t I out there with a shovel now? I think I’m just resigned to never being able to find it.”
Howell is still bullish on Bitcoin.
“I still think it’s going to go higher. I just think it’s the next step of the internet, which is why I mined it in the first place. When I first came across it, I knew straight away. We had everything else at the time; Google, Facebook, they were already the market leaders in their areas. The only thing that was missing was an internet.

Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Group founder, has called for tougher bitcoin regulation and taxation laws on the Bitcoin industry in Australia on the heels of one of Virgin Galactic’s spaceships blowing up in the California desert and taking one life.
“Making sure that conversations around this are happening at the highest level will hopefully result in common-sense reforms to areas such as taxation and law enforcement, which will be of real benefit to all concerned,” wrote Sir Richard on Tuesday.

Sorry, man! Getting scammed is the worst. Lots of scammers out there. Good on you for starting a business. It sucks often times, but I think if we stay strong and moral everything will fall into place and you'll make that $1,000 back and millions more. Good luck!

Stock trading, gambling, pornography – these are just a few of the things that could contribute to the so-called “rise and rise” of Bitcoin.
Many of us ask, “What is going to make Bitcoin mainstream?”  One would think it was reasonable to examine these areas and ponder how Bitcoin could improve them.

There has been much attention focused on alt-coins within the crypto-currency space. Despite the mystery that comes along with the alt-coin market as a whole, it is surprisingly simple to create your own alt-coin. And so we’ve compiled this guide.  How difficult is it? One BitcoinTalk user said  “It’s so simple, that I can usually do within 2 hours.”

Saffron Bacchus made Bitcoiners very happy internet participants lately when she launched her new membership site, Bacchus Entertainment.
As she told Redditors:
I think 2015 is going to be huge for bitcoin so I think it’s time to stop getting screwed over by credit companies and just go 100% on bitcoin! :)
What made you interested in making videos?
SB: We realized that there are lot of niche fetishes out there that don’t get a lot of new, high quality content, and we thought it would be fun to make videos for those communities! We love being creative and exploring the different fetishes and aspects of sexuality, and videos are a great way for us to express ourselves!
What’s the most ridiculous experience with a bank you’ve had?
SB: For the longest time we had been depositing the USD cheques we receive from our payment processors and affiliate programs through a local bank (our main bank branch is about an hour away so we have to use one of their partner banks), and the cheques would clear like any other cheque within a few days and we’d have access to the funds. One of these times (on a particularly large deposit of course!), the funds never went through!
We thought maybe it was just taking an unusually long time, but then in the mail we got photocopies of the cheques sent back to us from our bank! So we went into the branch to find out what happened, and apparently we’ve never been supposed to be able to deposit USD cheques through an ATM (even though we’d been doing it forever!), and the cheques had been sent back to each of the respective senders! This was ridiculous, since if they had just sent us back the original cheques we could have re-deposited them elsewhere, but nope, we had to contact each and every company and have them recut the cheques again!
On top of this, apparently the proper procedure is for them to hold the USD funds for 30 BUSINESS DAYS (fucking ridiculous!) and we have to physically deposit them at the branch. After lots of yelling, we just said screw it and cleared out our whole bank account into bitcoin. Oh, and to top it off when we were at the branch they realized that they’d been charging us “only” $4/month in fees instead of the normal $15/month, so that’s nice! Banks need to start dying off already! :)
Have you seen a clear advantage to using Bitcoin?
SB: Absolutely! Even under the best of circumstances, after paying $1000 for the privilege of accepting credit cards, we could only get a maximum of 80% of our sales as the rest would be taken in fees. 80% is even pretty good compared to the 60% we get from most places. With bitcoin we get 100%, instantly, and with no restrictions on where our customer is from. We get quite a few customers from places credit card companies don’t like like Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, the Philippines, etc. and bitcoin is the best way for them to send us money. Add to that the fact that we don’t need to censor our work, and bitcoin is just the best thing ever for us. We can’t wait until everyone is using it! :)
