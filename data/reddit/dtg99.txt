It's really cute that you think this correction is over. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:00:40
This support could be broken still. The 8-9k support I don't think has an even remote chance of being broken though so we are at least very near the bottom.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:12:50
They are insolvent.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:35:28
It will dip to 9k.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:24:20
Singularity reference? Have an upvote. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:27:59
So the same people who became manic due to the media talking up BTC 24/7 are going to panic when they spread FUD. Color me surprised. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:58:45
My price point is ~9k.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:23:55
Correct, higher high is ~15.5k
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:03:47
Hence the reference to Chuck E Cheese tokens
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:32:51
Sweating bullets. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:51:47
Super disturbing, yeah. And the smiley face thing, you may want to tone that down a bit - it's hard to take you seriously. I feel like I'm texting my 10 year old cousin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:58:12
please stop
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:54:07


He literally stated it in his original post. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:13:32
I guess any form of hedging. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:47:57
Will will ignore them while the price tanks and we'll continue to tell everyone to HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:23:11
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR ALL THESE SALES 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:16:19
There's no such thing as hedging in the crypto space at the moment. Yes, there's shuffling around. But if there's a real BTC crash (~50%) all alts will bleed and there's very little you can do outside of moving everything to Tether/fiat. Most people will just hold though. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:19:14
I'm watching buy walls get carved through like butter. It's horrifying. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:20:11
Lol why are you so angry?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:59:32
What if I'm wearing steel mesh gloves? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:04:58
Bitcoin is a literal retard? I disagree.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:32:18
lol grandchildren
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:30:25
Because everyone is in too deep at this point. We need a flippening to happen, we need to move a coin that isn't trash and can actually scale.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:41:08
Calm before the storm. The tether quake is going to be off the Richter scale. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:06:38
If it's indeed a fraud this is correct. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:19:53
We might return to the Vegeta meme
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:58:19
If Coinbase goes away then say goodbye to all the retail money. They have/had a very large hand in the recent surge. To a lot of buyers it's all they use or care to use.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:59:59
Because when you're knee deep in shit you barely notice the guy pissing on your forehead. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:43:37
Lol I don't have 80k in collateral to short and I'm not saying I would short, I own BTC. I can also recognize it's currently shit. This whole "store of value" shtick is overplayed. BTC needs to have utility to thrive not comically long/expensive transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:51:47
I'm safe, I moved everything to tether. I'm rolling in fucking Chuck E Cheese tokens now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:09:42
It's correcting. Don't try to catch a falling knife.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:58:10
I'm ready to buy at 9k.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:42:44
It's not panic selling when you take a profit and buy low. This is sadly the reality of BTC right now. It's merely a speculative asset for people to attempt and make a quick buck on. The transaction fees/speed inhibit it from being utilized as a currency. The insane price fluctuations inhibit it from being utilized as a store of value. I'm sure Wall Street is loving it though.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:03:56
I have no allegiance, I hold different coins at different times.  BTC needs to fix it's shit or it's going to continue to lose market dominance. It's currently sitting at 44% and I don't see that changing anytime soon. I'd like for it to hit ~60% again so it would trigger an alt bloodbath, opening up a buy window but looking at the current transaction speed/fees I don't see it happening anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:37:06
Hoo boy, your post history is disturbing. Seek professional help my dude, being that angry is bound to take years off of your life. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:14:52
I can't tell which side you're shilling for with your posts. That's quite the feat.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:28:54
But you're still up.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:50:52
He's a scammer so either BTC is definitely a scam or he's scamming. There's no middle ground. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:21:57
Why do you keep copy and pasting this throughout various threads? No one has any idea when LN is going to be available.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:25:41
If you always have to tell people not to confuse passion for anger, odds are very good that you have an anger issue. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:44:09
Many, many greater fools were created over the past couple of months. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:29:12
There's zero correlation between being intelligent and being able to discern between someone who is passionate and someone who is an unmitigated douche bag.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:34:02
he said his coins are in cold storage 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:18:10
What makes you think people didn't transfer forked BCH out of coinbaise to dump onto other exchanges already? Also what percentage of BCH is going to be added to the circulating supply?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:48:14
This is fucked. Too much dumb money entered the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:54:16
This was actually going to happen regardless as the 3rd sequence in the EW.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:37:40
We're heading to 9k and my wallet is ready.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:45:29
How? The entire market is tethered to BTC. If BTC tanks it will be an alt bloodbath. You can't hedge in the cryptosphere like you can with stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:43:06
Calling something FUD is meaningless. Figuring out whether or not FUD will impact the market is all that matters.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:02:01
*waves hands*
BCASH BCASH BCASH BCASH
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:37:57
If it drops below the previous low of ~37%, yeah, that'd be some shit.
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:50:21
Lol what?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:33:20
Yeah, I'm out.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:27:01
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:37:57
Congrats man.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:24:42
I'm just here for the mania.
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:23:54
BUY INTO THE DIP AND HODL
