Wow.  Actually not a bad response.

It's not that I don't believe in Bitcoin, and don't see it progressing further... but those are some incredible low-hanging fruit gains that have occurred.  That's all.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:30:07
My point is that money has diminishing marginal utility.  Having enough to survive will provide someone with a greater level of satisfaction than each additional amount after that.  
Therefore, yeah when you get to a certain point you're just wasting resources.

It's like the movie 300 but instead it's 375... trying to hold back the endless waves of thirsty bitcoin bulls.

So will the futures market 'guide' the exchange price like it has for the first 6 hours?  (Can we expect that participants in both markets will trade similarly?)  
Where might we expect some divergence?

You can see there are a large number of orders placed at these round numbers on GDAX for instance.  While it's psychological based, I don't think it has to do with noticing it more.

Only if you purchase at market price; it'll fill the open sell orders at their associated price.  (You could still buy it at the price you wanted...but this will incur a fee.  You would pay more if you were looking to buy 2 BTC but there was only 1 available at the spot price).
You can use limit orders to avoid this by saying you'll buy x amount of BTC at y price.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:08:59
I have held bitcoin since the earlier days, albeit smaller amounts, and even used it to pay for stuff from pioneers that accepted it early.  When 2017 hit I was excited that they were worth $1000.
The rise over the year was quite spectacular to watch, and fun to take part in trading.  The last month or so however, has displayed more irrational exuberance than the entire year up until that point.  
Crazy volatility, a price rise that is greater than exponential, and big financial companies jumping in with their futures contracts soon... even with a fairly high appetite for risk, I can't help but feel skeptical at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:10:59
It's funny, but post-10k and after that insane run up over the last few weeks, I feel more hesitant than at any point previously.

Did you buy in, and pay attention to it briefly here and there?  (traditional HODL method) Or were you actively trading it throughout the dips?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:49:10
Ease of use / many people going there on recommendation for the first time.  I believe the run up has to do with people thinking 'well I can't afford a BTC, but I can afford some LTC'.  Just a theory.

Is anyone else pissed off by the media coverage of Bitcoin?  I had so many family members and friends come crawling out of the woodwork 'hurr hurr I bet you lost a lot of money huh!?' ... 
As a HODL'er since 2014 ... I don't see a correction as the ending of Bitcoin.  The media sure as hell made as big a deal as possible out of the negative price action the last week.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:14:11

I wonder the percentage of people owning bitcoins that are keeping them stored on Coinbase.

They had $11m just to fuck around with earlier.  Can't they just call it quits and go live life?  People who are this greedy really kinda suck.

Would the price freaking drop already? God damn.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:52:46
I've been the fearful in the face of the greedy since we hit 10k.  The fact that there hasn't been any meaningful downward price action is really making me question what I thought I knew about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:29
This is what I'm hoping for

As a car enthusiast, I came to realize today that a Bitcoin is approximately the average price of a Honda S2000.
I'm very amused watching people trade 10 S2000's at a time on GDAX.

Even with modest 5% annual gains that's an income of **$550,000 per year** without touching the principal.
That's roughly 10x the average annual income in one of the wealthiest countries on the planet.

Is anyone else depressed as hell that they didn't go balls to the wall investing in this stuff earlier?  I've been playing with Bitcoin since 2014 but I never put in more than $1,000.  Even then, I sold when I thought I had 'nice profits' relative to what I put in.  
Continually kicking myself for this.
