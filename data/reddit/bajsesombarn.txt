Oh it does do some good, at least we can have a laugh at the tragedy that is the Trump precidency.

You mean 10 000 bitcoin on three pizzas

I don’t get this hype with buying cars, especially new ones. You managed to make a great profit by investing in BTC, and now you want to make the single most bad business deal possible, buying a new car? 
I bought a new Harley in 2011, and sure, it felt great for a year or so, finally having my dream bike, but it quickly loses its charm, and when I finally sold it three years later, I got back half of what I paid for it. 
But what the hell, if you can buy your dream car without taking out a loan, go for it! Just think about how much money you are losing literally the second you sign the papers.

Does it matter? 100 bitcoins at this stage is more than enough to never have to work again and live a good life.

So hey, I heard of bitcoins way too long ago to not have invested yet, and finally I’m starting to think that this is a gret idea. Here’s my conundrum. I recently sold stock for ~$1000 that I will invest in bitcoin asap no matter what.
But I do also have savings of around $8000 that I’ve been saving for a rainy day. At this point I’m thinking fuck it, let’s go all in and buy $6-7000 worth of bitcoins and save the rest for emergencies. Is anyone here going to try to talk me out of it? because I can barely see any reason for not doing it.

Thanks for your input. I've weighed the pros and cons and decided to invest 3000 euros, that's money I can afford to lose should it come to that, so while it's a risk, it not something I can't survive.

Hmm, how are silver tax laws where you live? I bought gold a bunch of years ago because in Sweden where I live there is no tax on gold whatsoever, but on silver there is tax on newly pressed coins and bars.
