Hm, no. but thanks for the input

I checked. No such money, but it would take 7 days to arrive, so I can't be 100% sure that didn't happen yet.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:30:26
but why would they leave $95 and my ETH (far more than my btc balance)
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:54:19
it was caught in the spam filter. back up.
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:30:55
except I did pay. The money was taken from my bank. Why would they take it back?
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:41:10
Good to know, I never knew the specifics about things of that nature. I always thought the bank covered the charge but just over-drafted you so they would end up making money in the end. 
I am assuming it could take up to a week for CB to give my money back. ^^tell ^^me ^^they ^^dont ^^keep ^^it

I didn't delete anything. Edit: Just caught in the spam filter. Its up now.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:38:23
What do you mean? My dashboard says I have $95. Heres the sent message, says it went TO coinbase, dunno what that means if anything.

I got my money back from the bank, basically it was my fault and CB were taking back money they never got because I had CB linked to my savings account when I bought BTC but I didn't have enough money in my savings so the bank took the money that was suppose to go to CB as a penalty, so after 5 days CB took back the amount I originally spent. The bank gave my money back as a "one time courtesy" because I'm not suppose to overdraft on a debit card.

What is a better alternative website? Coinbase is a joke I have the same problem and they don't seem to know what they are doing hard to trust them
Edit: AND gemini won't send me to text to confirm my account...so Im done wit trying to invest in bitcoin it seems sketchy
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:04:48
It is not for the US it looks like

Can someone *please* help me find a website to buy bitcoin on? Coinbase makes me wait 24 hours when I want to add my bank account, except it's been several days and they *still* say I need to wait 24 hours. Gemini just won't send me the verification text, like how is this important function broken? Gdaxs says they can't recognize me as a person and that personal info must be wrong, when it is in fact 100% correct. I even tried a app that's a wallet and you can buy bitcoin, and would you believe it they too can't load past me trying to put in my information. I'm going to tilt out of this fucking universe, its been a week and I still can't find a way to buy bitcoin. I'm convinced it's all just a prank to make people waste their time attempting to buy it, when it doesn't actually exist.
Edit: Tried itbit but I need a document showing proof I own a house. I don't own a house you fucks I just wanna use your services
