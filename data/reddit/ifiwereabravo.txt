Interesting. How does a person accurately track such taxes? How does the government? I’ve not filed taxes with this types of income before. What is the tax rate on this? Does it fall under capital gains?

Well if you had sold at 17 you could buy in again at the dip and profit twice.

You did suffer losses by not selling at market highs and the dip likely isn’t done. Your still taking losses now and you are giving up the ability to buy in at new market lows when the bottom is reached. So your suffering losses twice bot current market price losses and the opportunity cost of unrealized gains. 
Strongly consider selling until bottom is found and rebounds begin.

Well I haven’t done much of it so it shouldn’t be much of an issue at this point.

Why don’t HODLers actually sell and then buy during the dips? The price is fluctuating by thousands of dollars a day. A person who owns even one bitcoin could have turned it into two over the past month and half by doing just that. Holding at all costs is just not a good strategy...period
Sell half at 19k buy back in at 17k with half the money and set up a remainder buy in limit for a “low ball” price of 16k with the plan of reselling when it hits 18250. Rinse and repeat. If HODL errs had followed some steps like this they would be setting themselves up to increase their profit during this dip. 
Alternatively set up a stop loss sell for whole amount shortly below market highs and set up alerts for price changes in 500 increments in order to buy back in same day or a couple days later.
Very little losses felt. Minor daily attention required and depending on the exchange used can be done with zero transaction fees.
