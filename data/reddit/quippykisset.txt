Many of us are in that boat. I don’t even own a car. I don’t even own a house. I pay rent. I live life like a normal person but with way less worry about the future. I even have a job. I mean I get paid like 175 dollars a month. But I love my job. 
As far as cashing out, why would I want to cash out? I’d rather own crypto and live a normal life than try to live like an asshole with a lambo.

The only reason why the USD goes up is because interest rates are going up. 
I’m under the firm belief that central banks around the world would much rather destroy their own currency to support deficits and exports than maintain the integrity of their currency. 
There’s no real currency to defend anymore. It’s just paper. And if they raise interest rates then governments across the board will default. 
They won’t let that happen. 
Japan is already backtracking on its ‘QT’.

I mean most of us here view it as our savings. At least I do. I’ve been here since like 3 years ago. It goes up and down but I never really have had to touch it. Spend it on stuff like purse.io and replace what you spent. It’s a peaceful social revolution. It takes time. Can bitcoin go to zero? Sure. But my hunch is, if computers become powerful enough to break the encryption then as a society we’re pretty close to a post-scarcity economy where we won’t need money anyways. So idk man. You put enough away as a hedge against a really shitty crumbling global economy. You have an insurance policy now. Take care of it. Don’t look at the price. And just live easy knowing whatever happens, you and your family are going to be protected.

I work for the US peace corps and I live here on Java. Bitcoin is HUGE on Bali. Like huge. On Java there's a Ponzi scheme called TrueMoney that's exactly like Bitcoin. But most people just buy 1 gram gold pieces but it's at a huge price increase and you can sell them legit anywhere like at the bank or the post office. Bitcoin is more of a super upper class thing here. Like even though everyone has a smart phone there are only Bitcoin atms in Jakarta or Bandung or Surabaya or Bali. I work at a Muslim high school in West Java and the computer teacher here already had Bitcoin before I got here a year ago. Everyone realizes how fucked the economy is. Bitcoin helps people it's just not the super poor people. It's like the middle upper class and beyond that's really taking use of it. But besides that like poor people here are scraping by just like everywhere else.

Honestly? Most if not all of it is being held on exchanges in cash and we're just waiting for this to bottom out before all this bullshit happens. Then I think before all of this happens a lot of people are going to pull their coins off exchanges before aug 1. The last thing I want is an exchange being able to tell me which coin I can buy or freezing my withdrawals. This leads me to believe that people don't actually want fiat in their bank accounts cause they'll trigger a taxable event. 
I think most people are parked in 'fiat' on bitfinex. No one actually wants cash. Everyone wants more coins.

In my opinion, I feel like apple and other big device creators don't want to create a Bitcoin pay system because it will further drive people out of the fractional reserve banking system. 
The app I have in mind would work exactly like Apple Pay. You would upload X amount of Bitcoin/whatever cryptocurrencies to the wallet and then use your phone as an Apple Pay system and it would pull the cryptocurrency out of your wallet and then convert it into cash and transfer the cash into the stores bank account. 
Then there could be like an opt-in recycle system. Like every time you spend Bitcoin then you would automatically buy more crypto out of a buffer fiat checking account. Like you could keep 1000 dollars in the fiat account and when you get paid, your checking account would only go to 1000 dollars and the rest would be put into Bitcoin and stored on your apps wallet and you could pull it off to keep only like 1000 dollars worth in your crypto app. 
It sounds like a tax nightmare so idk if it'll ever happen. It just sucks paying for all the fees. I'm hoping amazon just ends up taking Bitcoin directly and then all the other retailers will end up taking it too.

@_date: 2017-06-09 10:53:24
I just don't think people understand the amount of people that bought in 2 years ago at 200 and are currently looking at 10x profits at least and with the uasf coming up, it's a guarantee that the price will collapse. Bitcoin doesn't like uncertainty and dates in the future. This is unfortunately a perfect storm. And as goes Bitcoin, so go alts. I bought ethereum for about a dollar in June of 2016. I have moved completely to cash to ride out this storm. Good luck to that guy though.

The bet would be - if the chain splits, you now have two sets of coins, if you dump 1 set and buy more of the other set and that set turns out to be the winning chain, congrats. If you dump 1 set and the other chain wins then you lose. It gets a little more complicated than that but that's about it. I think a lot of people will just end up holding their coins and not making any bets. Or selling before aug.

When there are short time periods where something trades up exponentially and then trades sideways then it time to call it a day. Rinse. Repeat. Get out on the way up. Get in on the way down. It could go to 3k but I know it'll eventually crash to 1000ish eventually and I'll be there.

Tru facts
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:19:46
I sold after the first crash and before the second one to 2,500. I really thought that it would bounce up and then roll over and keep falling. When it rolled over for the third time, it was a gamble between the final roll over into a bear market or find a floor. It only rolled to 2650 and found a floor and punched through previous roll over levels. If we can stay above 2770 on bitfinex. Then I'd say we have more to go at least for a little while but when this finally rolls over because of UASF, it's going to be violent.

Lmao no way
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:04:53
This is the first time in years I haven't worried about the price. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:06:24
It's fucked for now 
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:26:03
Then buy ethereum lol
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:09:36
Sell them
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:26:44
Can confirm. I personally know 3 people that are short thinking the price is going to 1300. They'll buy back if it gets close to 3000. All the short money will flood back eventually. OR we are in fact going back to 1300. No idea lol

@_date: 2017-06-08 14:52:37
Sold all my coins today
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:40:37
I reallllllllllllly doubt we'll get to even 3000. Who knows though. Shit though lol I might have to eat my words. It's at 2844. To be honest though it's 930 at night on a Friday and I'm gunna be super wasted. I can't just be screaming at my computer all night. This shit is wild. I wish the best to you. Bitcoin changed my life
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:18:26
I agree

@_date: 2017-06-09 11:07:53
Lol so if the price collapses I'll win like 500-1000 dollars in Bitcoin. And if the price falls 30 percent I have to pay you like 2k worth of Bitcoin. That doesn't seem fair lol

@_date: 2017-06-07 07:56:10
So it is going to split?
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:20:49
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:11:58
He sold it yesterday though. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:18:01
I have cash sitting on an exchange and I'll trade this as it turns over but this is insane. The Chinese are staring at a 20,000 yuan Bitcoin. The Japanese just cleared 300,000 yen. I just really doubt there's much gas left in this bubble. But it was a good ride. Did you cash out yet?
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:32:40
Still not 3850 on bitfinex lol
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:49:37
I'm saying the price is going to drop way before August 2nd. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:10:26
@_date: 2017-06-12 07:54:31
I sold just under 3000
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:09:01
Main coin is becoming ETH cause BTC will never get its shit together. Fuck Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:01:36
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:42:28
500 for ethereum? Or do you mean 5000 for Bitcoin? Don't get me wrong. I'm in the trenches with you guys. If it looks like either of them are going that high, trust me, I'll be right there with you. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:13:17
I cashed out completely yesterday and ended up making about 12x profits but before I cashed out I bought a little less than 10k worth of gold from JM Bullion because they let you pay in btc but only for orders under 10k.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:11:43
Still want to take the bet?
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:04:00
Send it to an exchange. And convert to fiat. Or jm bullion takes Bitcoin and just buy gold and then pawn the gold. Or keep the fiat on the exchange and when you need chunks of cash, buy Bitcoin and then buy gold. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:13:56
YOU HEARD THE MAN. GTFO
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:36:17
