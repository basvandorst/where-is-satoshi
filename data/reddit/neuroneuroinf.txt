Glad to hear it! For my own part, I plan to use Coinimal again.

You're absolutely right. Thanks!

Thank you, but it looks like I was mistaken. It seems that the problem lies with my understanding of SEPA transfer delays.

Lol. Well, actually my story turned out to be wrong and written by an idiot. Thanks for defending me, though!

I guess SEPA transactions let that happen? I'm not sure. My guess is that it's a wrong negative sign somewhere.
@_date: 2016-06-06 22:11:50
Probably the right call, especially in this case.

Nice article!

Hi Paul, I'm very sorry for the idiotic mistake I just made. Thank you for looking into my case!  It was just an unusual coincidence--the same amount on the same date (in my bank’s records), with the wrong sign. Many apologies again, and I'll be sure not to overreact in the future.
@_date: 2016-06-06 22:10:16
Okay, that's good to know. You're right, I was mistaken. Thank you!
@_date: 2016-06-06 22:13:28
Thanks, but it looks like nothing wrong has actually happen. Just a misunderstanding, which I overreacted to. Nothing foul is afoot here!
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:28:07
I'll do that, thanks. Any ideas on how I can get my bitcoin back? My understanding is that its unrecoverable.
@_date: 2016-10-08 14:22:22
Isn't the idea actually that no one should have control over the computer?
@_date: 2016-10-09 16:28:17
Well, I guess that makes sense. Who does it with Bitcoin?
