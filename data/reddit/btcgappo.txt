However, i will add a timer - if it would be a problem :)
@_date: 2015-12-15 00:17:28
yes :) -&gt; and "virtual petting zoo" - i like that name :D

Of course - this is not serious! However, it should represent a satire of the actual situation... kinda joke...

“its ledger managed by a consortium of businesses”
@_date: 2015-11-08 17:46:06
Yes, simple as that :)
However - if it will be installed in public area (soon/somewhere) passers can be gifted. 
For sure they can buy there own stuff too -&gt; but with BTC only :)
