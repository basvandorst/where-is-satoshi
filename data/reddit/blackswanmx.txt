Hell, Banksters have gone to great lenghts (wars, genocide, etc) to ensure their economic model sustains over centuries... and we come here with a cryptocurrency that relies on: electricity &amp; internet?!

It would actually be great if people from those inflation/economic crisis-affected countries began adopting their own cryptos,  and trading those for Bitcoins, right?

Try localbitcoins.com, you pay a small premium but it's quite easy! Specially if your account is banamex or bancomer
@_date: 2014-04-22 23:57:14
It seems they'll fix this :)

This article appeared on a major Finance &amp; Economics Newspaper last week. Details how Bitcoin adoption is ocurring in Mexico through sites like Mexbt.com (but also CoinCove.com). People will be able to buy BTC at convenience stores "OXXO's" (like US 7-Eleven's).  This is great news! as knowledgeable people will be able to move cash into BTC without paying taxes on Cash-earned income (which is a lot of money from: Taxi Drivers, Street-Taco Vendors, etc, etc, etc,). Hopefully people will educate themselves in BTC to take advantage of this currency, and not be hard hit by recent Tax Reforms impossed by our lame "president".

MexBT isnt open yet, suggested bitcoinplus.mx, or localbitcoins

Poloniex &amp; MintPal?? 
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:57:11
I had no idea there were already threads about that, once I knew about them, thanks to that aggressive comment, went ahead and looked for those. My point is, why waste time being aggressive and deterring new users with such comments?

Tell me something I didnt know.... its obvious they are not compatible. Though I had copied the BTC address instead of the BC address...
@_date: 2014-04-22 22:15:47
Thing is the BC address wont receive the BTC as they are incompatible...
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:44:21
So if BTC will eventually rely on exchanging BTCs, what about using a coin that has been already mined, like BlackCoin?
@_date: 2014-07-15 23:47:28
thats to low, I was expecting Gazillions... well... guess I can live with that.. :)
@_date: 2014-04-22 22:17:47
So yeah, my BTC wallet on the 1st exchange is empty, so it seems they deducted my BTC, and Im pretty sure it will fail the checksum as the receiving address is a BC one. So what the hell will happen here? Is the transaction reversed? as the receiving BC address is incompatible with BTC?
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:36:10
And your "comment" contributes a to healthy discussion on Bitcoin how exactly?? Comments like yours is what is making a lot more people turning theirs heads to Doge &amp; Vertcoin communities. Much more constructive and respectful...

Wow¡ I remember how a slight mention of Bitcoin on the WSJ/Yahoo Finance caused waves of enthusiasm in the community. This... should be huge again¡ :)
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:25:54
Huh, didn't get a flag about it...

Having an encrypted &amp; decentralized count voting/recording system so that each person can vote one time only (one-time-spendable-keys). Everyone should be able to see real-time inmmediate results but none could modify anything?? Not really an expert, just wondering if it be possible...
