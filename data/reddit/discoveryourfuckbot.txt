The news articles on bitcoin are the worst. Every time I type in "bitcoin price" into google there's three articles waiting for me.
 If bitcoin has gone down: "This is why bitcoin is doomed to fail"
If bitcoin has gone up: "This is the future of the world's money and here's why"

That's an important question because, from my understanding, exchanging Crypto for USD for Crypto is taxable. Exchanging crypto for crypto is not.

Maybe you don't/didn't have a significant amount in to worry about capital gains but many people do. If you plan to buy back in there's no good reason to cash out.

I bothered to read one of them on how it was going to fail. The author touted to banks "Do not let people use their accounts to buy cryptocurrency! Do not buy into this!" and then there was a disclaimer at the bottom *this article is not intended to be used as investment advice*

If it's on coinbase there is a send/receive tab that will give you an address to send to your wallet or receive from your wallet. I would bet any other exchange is about the same

Can anyone answer **why**, especially since it's the same company, why is it free on GDAX? Why not just free on coinbase and no GDAX?

It is. BTC is what people think of first when they think of cryptocurrency. The charts almost all parallel each other [on coinbase] right now. So who's leading that wild ride? Bitcoin. If bitcoin starts falling faith is lost not only in bitcoin but all of crypto. Factor in newbies buying the 'guaranteed' rise. Than panicking when BCH gets announced because now "which one should I buy? A split? It's the *real* bitcoin, what??" along with people selling some BTC to try out BCH. So BTC drops quick + the newbies freaking out who bought in while it was skyrocketing = tons of selling going on at once. Which makes BTC go down, and in effect makes other currency go down. Coinbase royally fucked up. This dip is on them. At the same time, they had a little *too much* of the "player base" and it's unfortunate they had so much sway.

I bought in at 7.3k mid november. I would have been stoked to see it at 9k at this time. I checked yesterday and it was 12k. Today over 15k I audibly said "HOLY SHIT"
