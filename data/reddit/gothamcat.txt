Welcome! You can buy less than a full bitcoin you know, right? Right now around $322 = 1 btc = 1,000,000 bits
Some think it's very possible products in the future will be priced in bits, and some sites like changetip already display balance values in bits rather than full bitcoins.
Although no 1 can predict the future, people 3 and 4 years ago had the same doubts about btc being too costly to get into. They were hilariously shortsighted. Good luck, this is a fun hobby !!

I just did. "Free" versus "we'll fuck you" is pretty simple math.

How has he helped anyone? Jumped on the bandwagon of a transformative technology, slowed its acceptance within NYS down by at least a year with a level of uncertainty really not necessary. First draft regs were outright absurd--ten year archive of all transactions, giving fingerprints to the FBI... insanity. He has appeared on TV and panels repeatedly specifically to talk on Bitcoin, so the argument this isn't his focus doesn't really apply either.
What he is doing, at a minimum, introduces new costs for NY consumers and businesses to interact with cryptocurrencies, putting those individuals and companies at significant economic disadvantage vs their competitors in other cities across the US and Europe.
Then he'll ride Bitcoin's coattails to a job as AG one day and what? Soak up the NY Daily News headlines every time he ruins a 20 year old's life over buying some mushrooms off the Silk Road? Some innocent kid who needed something traditional medications weren't giving him--and increasingly PTSD sufferers returning from Afghanistan and Iraq--turn to dark markets for these tools, and people exactly like Lawsky put them in cages for years, turn their lives into unspeakable misery, simply because their drug is not patented and sanctioned by the state. It's appalling. And the masses will applaud this guy all the way to the top. Not me.

Not only that, the claim that USG is the largest holder of bitcoin is factually untrue: Satoshi Nakamoto is.
