Since everything is on a public searchable ledger bitcoin really isn’t as anonymous as some people believe. Sure you’re name isn’t necessarily tied to your wallet, but as soon as you touch that wallet there are methods to track who is accessing it. Now with that being said I’m sure there are some obscure ways to help try and hide who is accessing the wallet. I guess if you were truly concerned about anonymity then you should look into privacy coins.

I’ve never heard of anyone being asked to provide addresses. Not an expert by any means but I’d imagine even in an audit records from the exchange and bank records could show sufficient proof. Good luck

I have found bitcoin.tax to be very helpful. It's free for your first 100 trades I think. Then after that, you have to pay like $40 per year (I think?). They seem to organize pretty well and give pretty detailed instructions on how to import your trades from each exchange. Definintely check them over after you import to make sure everything lines up. Just giving a suggestion based off my experience. I know other on here have found other similar sites that are useful as well.

Link from someone you don't know and they are offering free money? Hard pass

I know nothing about day trading but you're absolutely right about capital gains. People are completely overreacting about this. No one enjoys paying taxes, but it's not like every cent is being stolen from you. Especially when you hold for the long term rate.

Gotcha well at least you have narrowed it down some what. The interesting part to me is that you said you have done something like this before and its gone straight through (Was not aware its a domestic transfer, I think that resolves a lot of headaches on that end). Now when you say it didn't immediately return, are you saying that is has changed since you first posted this?

Haven't heard of that one but this is why I like asking the community. Will check it out. Thanks!

I mean not paying your taxes is not paying your taxes. Obviously the penalties are worse for higher amounts of money, but you still will get fined if you get caught. Ultimately though the choice is yours.

Id say we could either go up or down from here

The Coinbase charge issue was proven to be VISA's fault. Also Gdax is virtually the same company as coinbase, so if you don't want to deal with coinbase I wouldn't recommend Gdax. Good luck.

I agree I was doing some searching and it seems some people have lost some pretty large sums of money due to glitches in the Kraken website. Id hope there support replies to you soon. Do you have any form of documentation of the transactions you can show to them to prove your funds have been lost? I imagine that whenever you can get in contact with them that will help in moving things along.

Supposedly it says you are only giving then certain levels of access. So like on binance when you generate the api key you say that it can only view and not make trades. I personally just went with generating my own csv and importing manually. Seems to be more accurate. Good luck

I have seen before people say that if you receive an overseas wire transfer of more then 5k USD it automatically flags in your bank account and the funds are generally frozen. Some type of fraud law  and it has to be proven to whatever agency would be in charge of investigating these things that you obtained the money legally ( aka you're not some type of drug dealer). I have zero clue how that process would work other then they can freeze the funds just with suspicion. Don't want to jump to conclusions, but I heard of people saying this happens when large amounts of money are withdrawn from the exchanges. Also I'm just trying to think of possibilities if the money isn't showing back up in the exchange. Then again maybe the processing of that much money takes a while. Hopefully someone else who has withdrawn  a decent sized amount of money can tell you about there experience. Maybe contacting your bank would be the next best step? I hope it works out, good luck.

I've had similar experience. Luckily though like you said they reversed it and everything appears to be fine now. But a company as big them in the crypto space shouldn't be having issues like this. I know everybody makes mistakes but when you start screwing with people's money things get dicey real quick.

Couldn't agree more. Once you learn that no one actually knows where the price is going to go next. It's way less stressful and you can actually focus on the more important things whether you're someone who is in it for the money or someone more focused on the industry.

This will forever be the answer to this question lol

That is a pretty common scam. Just delete the text and you will be fine.
