Same guys mouthing this bullshit are the ones putting folks in jail.  Best believe it.

Go open up a bitcoin exchange without licensing and scream all the way to jail that it's not your government putting you there.
These types of comments are absurd.

Man fuck our government.  They are nothing but a bunch of thugs trying to maintain the status quo for the banking elite.  They are just the oligarchy's strong arm.

Not going to happen.  Welcome to America.

It's a way to say I'm an American and it's the government I live under.  It's not like anyone in America has a real choice other than to move.

Well it would be a bit of a witch hunt.  Unfortunately, usually when you say that there are no witches.  In this case, they're flying all around like god damn bats.  :)

I don't personally.  I'd like their fucking heads chopped off.  However, I see your point.

They need to have fear of something.  Future consequences is a good way to start.

This is the dumbest comment I've ever seen get points.  I tell you what, everyone upvoting it, go open up a bitcoin exchange without any licensing and you can scream all the way to jail that it's not "your" government that put you there.
It's disgusting how people attempt to water down a valid point over silliness like this.  Enjoy the points though.

Well perhaps a bit more than that.  I think they should be scared of something personally.  Right now they are not.  It is my opinion that they are hijacking our legal system and making criminals out of decent people or people that at most, went slightly awry of the laws.

Once again...pithy with no argument.  Care to contribute?
