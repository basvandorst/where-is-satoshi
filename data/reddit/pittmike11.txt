I think the website should get taken down and the owners be prosecuted if they're hosting underage prostitutes for sale.  Due to Cody's political affiliation he's already being blasted.  He was planning on taking the 3-d gun appeal all the way to the supreme court, and some articles are already absolving the pimp of any wrong doing.
This sugardaddy site is providing a service people are paying for similar to subscription porn (where the women should be verified of age).  This isn't some hooker on the street.  They need to be investigated and shut down because we all know there are probably several underage prostitutes being passed around that no one is doing anything about.

What happens when the only full nodes are miners who want more block subsidy? Can you fork away from the corrupted network with a bloated chain? 
Who's going to verify the consensus, only the miners?  What about the users and service providers?

If there's an alt out there I can't find it.
ASIC resistance is ironically unfair (hidden ASICs, centralized control over forks, higher value = faster the hidden ASICs come) so tell me a coin where the PoW miners are as developed and distributed as bitcoin I'd say bitcoin has 5+ years on any competitor
PoS is shady too as the coin creators control the chain and don't need much energy to secure the "network" and be rewarded. 
these 2 fundamentals make bitcoin untouchable.  but then you look at that attacks bitcoin endured.  Biggest exchanged hacked mt.gox and we struggled and came back.  Biggest businesses and 90%+ of miners tried to influence consensus with S2X and they failed because the community and developers stood strong together.  I could go on and on but bitcoin is far more than just 10 minute blocks ~1.7mb blocks

Billions of transactions on chain limits how decentralized the network can become.  Consolidating 2nd layer transactions into 1 onchain in a fee market can keep the network decentralized with billions of transactions happening on it.  Even at 1 sat/byte on chain is expensive compared to lightning especially if price rises sub satoshi fees are essential.
