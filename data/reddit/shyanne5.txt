I've heard these reports so many times, it's my personal assumption that they are correct. I've seen many email exchanges backing up these claims. Also, if the reports are correct, the manner in which these "high-risk" cancellations are being conducted is super scummy. Coinbase will wait until the very last minute to cancel, tying up the user's funds; sometimes even cancelling (reversing) after the transaction has been completed!
Then there are the stasi-like interrogations they impose on some, demanding that they submit documents detailing the source of the coins, the funds used to buy them, the purpose of the purchase or sale, the destination of the coins, etc etc etc.
Fuck that.

Cash deposit is safer, cheaper, and easier for a buyer than in-person.
@_date: 2014-09-23 21:52:43
What did you sell it at?
@_date: 2014-09-25 12:11:07
Anyway, they should not be cancelling ANY orders, especially on verified accounts. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:29:58
Localbitcoins recommends that a transaction code be used for in-person trades, rather than their escrow service. His trade started out as in-person.
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:57:06
There are no transaction fees to make a payment through Paypal.
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:01:33
Please be specific. I find it incredulous that any sane person would condone this behavior. Or are you denying that these cancellations are occurring?
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:15:19
And it's my own!

hey, just checked out your profile, and this is the first thing that jumped out at me:
Should you go public when a poker player wont pay a debt?

yes of course you should. they can scam others if you don't make it known that they don't make good on their debts.
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:27:54
For each btc you own, that is.
@_date: 2014-09-24 06:29:26
Buyers on localbitcoins have little-to-nothing to worry about, as long as the coins are in escrow (or they have a code for face-to-face), and they keep receipts, codes, whatever. It's the sellers who are at great risk, because most of the types of transactions are reversible from the fiat side. The cash deposit is safe for the seller, but only if you don't release the coins until the buyer's bank closes for the day. Tellers have been known to reverse cash deposits if it's the same day. Also, tell the buyer to write on the receipt "No refunds or reversals". And "Localbitcoins" "(his and your user name)" and "(transaction  in order to avoid the "middleman scam". And don't release until you've seen the receipt AND see the deposit in your account, AND the buyer's bank has closed. Cash deposit is safer for the seller than face-to-face, for obvious reasons; and also it's remotely possible to run into a fed sting op face-to-face. If a buyer even MENTIONS drugs or any kind of criminal act, cancel the trade immediately. I've never sold there, but I read the forum sometimes.
Other safe options for the seller would be any method by which you can pick up the cash in hand before releasing the coins.
@_date: 2014-09-24 05:47:23
So, no escrow? You completed the transaction outside of localbitcoins? Most face-to-face does not use escrow; they use a transaction code instead, because it's better suited for face-to-face. So I'm thinking that if it started out as face-to-face, you had no escrow. In which case you're screwed. But still submit a fraud report and give the seller his due negative feedback for sure. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 11:08:48
Gee, I didn't realize that I can buy and sell btc with electrum. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:53:37
Holding onto it isn't taking a loss :)
@_date: 2014-09-24 05:40:43
You have to wait 24 hours to complain about a transaction (maybe 48 hours, I forget), but if you file a fraud report, it's much faster.
@_date: 2014-09-25 13:10:13
You can leverage bitcoin at BTCE
@_date: 2014-09-19 16:57:12
I totally agree about not gouging. But the sellers in the forum there have been saying lately that as soon as they put an ad up, BAM, it's gone; no matter the price.
The buyers there are looking for privacy and convenience, and it seems that usually you can find a price no higher than the ATMs.
@_date: 2014-09-25 13:15:14
Does he show proof that they cancelled his buy order after the price tanked?
@_date: 2014-09-22 07:32:41
Maybe he's advertising to the cops that asset forfeiture is futile.
@_date: 2014-09-24 10:46:45
Well, you'd think that we would have heard about a case like that at least once, in response to all these many posts. Surely SOMEone would have spoken up on coinbase's behalf, "Oh no, it happens the other way too!" Probably they wouldn't proactively complain about it, but I've never once heard any mention of it. Not even a shill! lol
@_date: 2014-09-25 12:06:55
Any proof?
@_date: 2014-09-24 05:24:37
Trustworthy? What about the many reports of them constantly cancelling transactions when the price moves in their favor?
I won't touch coinbase.
Also, I've read several posts about how they won't even let you transfer btc from their wallet to your own wallet until you give them extra personal info. Even if you've never dealt with fiat on their site!
They use AML and KYC regulations as an excuse to fuck with your bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-09-25 13:06:18
not gonna click on that. could you please paste here?
@_date: 2014-09-25 13:27:29
LOL, I see. That IS all you got.
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:18:01
People have been complaining to them for years, but they're still doing it.
@_date: 2014-09-23 21:45:19
You're doing it wrong. You have to buy when it plummets.
@_date: 2014-09-23 20:42:11
Yes, I imagine Paypal will still charge the merchants their regular transaction fees; but hopefully a lightbulb will go off, and the merchants will realize they can save a lot of money by accepting btc directly. This could be a great stepping stone for that.
@_date: 2014-09-25 10:38:33
Can you show me a post where the cancellation was in the user's favor?
Look, what it comes down to is this; there is ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE for ANY of these cancellations on a fully verified account! Elsewise, what is the purpose of verification and taking the security risk of giving up all your personal financial info? The fully verified accounts should all be automatically whitelisted. If coinbase wants to change that status, they should notify you ahead of time, "Sorry, you've been blacklisted!"
If this biased so-called "algorithm" that they claim to be applying, is flagging users' buying and selling habits and patterns, for example, then let people know AHEAD of time what the limits and restrictions are. Or at LEAST don't process the transaction in the first place, tying up their funds.
Imagine trading on a futures account, or btce and the like, they execute your order, and it has been filled. They then turn around and tell you the order, which has yielded a nice profit, has been cancelled because you are "high-risk".
I mean, c'mon, they're stealing your trade! Coinbase has already filled your order, because they have guaranteed the price.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:04:20
No, that rule is a different rule. Read PAST that rule statement, and you come to another rule that applies to individuals, that permits them to "delay withdrawals" of their Money Market funds. There is a new SET of rules.
@_date: 2014-09-19 16:11:49
Yep they LOVE it! Here's Bix Weir talking about the rule at 9:20, and about how Wall Street is so happy to get those regulations in before the collapse. "They're bracing for the collapse."
@_date: 2014-09-24 02:58:32
So it would be their way or the highway. Scary.
@_date: 2014-09-25 11:22:35
As I've said before, Coinbase uses AML and KYC regulations as an excuse to fuck with your bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-23 20:33:09
If a merchant that does not now accept btc goes for this, sooner or later they will realize the financial benefit of accepting btc directly.
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:25:02
Also they want everyone to be heavily invested in the stock market when it crashes.
@_date: 2014-09-25 13:19:59
thing is, you don't need to be cancelling orders left and right to comply with AML KYC. It's just their convenient excuse, and peeps are falling for it.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:09:19
This rule is applicable to "times of financial stress". You know, like when you need it most.
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:48:07
You can already buy btc with paypal on localbitcoins, but it's super expensive because the seller risks getting scammed through chargebacks.
@_date: 2014-09-25 18:35:54
hi, i replied to your other comment.
@_date: 2014-09-25 09:59:59
Several that way? As opposed to hundreds, the other way?
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:08:34
I was just wondering if he was a shill. I knew I would be downvoted into oblivion by the shills for starting this thread, but I'm a truth lover.
@_date: 2014-09-19 11:56:16
According to my system, you're being alerted to buy $196 worth of btc right now. (Btce price is $380.)
@_date: 2014-09-24 05:27:09
To op: Use the cash deposit option on localbitcoins to buy btc. It's absolutely safe, secure, easy and convenient.
@_date: 2014-09-24 11:01:22
Yeah, kinda like the day Comex says, "Oops! We can't deliver your gold."
@_date: 2014-09-25 13:17:11
is that all you got? lol
@_date: 2014-09-24 09:28:20
oh wait, he gave you the confirmation code? Sorry, I missed that part. You should be able to get the coins then. I've never done the code thing because, as far as I know, it's only used for in-person. You have to go to the localbitcoins site to find out how to cash in the code! Go to FAQ, go to the forum for information about the code. If the code doesn't work, file a fraud report. It's faster than the regular complaint line; you don't have to wait 48 hours, I think it is.
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:17:18
Dude. You should be buying. According to my system, you have a $560 buy signal per each btc you own. If you own 10 btc, you should now buy $1560 worth of bitcoin. It's a GIFT.
@_date: 2014-09-20 00:17:10
OMG 100 would be perfect.
@_date: 2014-09-24 08:32:24
Go after the crime and the criminal. Leave bitcoin alone. Why should all btc users have to suffer because some criminal somewhere might want to use it?
Not the victimless crimes though, like drugs; leave them alone too.
To take it a step further, should btc sellers, like Charlie Shrem for example, be responsible for all the criminals in the world? I say NO.
@_date: 2014-09-19 16:12:16
@_date: 2014-09-24 06:40:09
Buyers cannot be scammed if the coins are in escrow. It's the sellers that are at risk, because fiat can be reversed.
@_date: 2014-09-25 13:38:40
You're wrong. Coinbase owes people the price at which the order was confirmed, and the settlement of the execution.
@_date: 2014-09-25 18:31:49
hi there. If this were truly anti-fraud protection, why wouldn't they at least try to contact the flagged people, as banks do, and ASK them if they personally made the transaction?
@_date: 2014-09-23 21:48:06
Having said that, even if you may have missed your buy signal, it's probably still signaling.
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:21:43
He's not cutting his losses. He's REALIZING his losses.
@_date: 2014-09-24 08:47:58
Sorry sweetie, I don't know anything about Moneypak. The only advice I can think of at this point is to tell him that you are going to give him SCATHING negative feedback, and you are going to heavily badmouth him as a scumbag scammer ALL OVER the localbitcoin forums. Then do it.
@_date: 2014-09-23 22:52:41
Bitcoin does not have third-world-currency volatility, because it can't be printed out of existence.
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:13:44
Please be specific. What do you disagree with? Do you condone this behavior?
Just one.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:59:20
SOMEthing weird is going on. Localbitcoins is the real criteria for true supply and demand, and the btc there are FLYING off the shelves. It's a sellers' paradise!
@_date: 2014-09-24 09:38:29
Don't tell anyone the code though! Just ask how to cash it in.
@_date: 2014-09-24 08:53:45
If you want to find out about the workings of a moneypak transaction, click on "forum" at the localbitcoins site, and go to the "scams" section. Tell the peeps there exactly what happened. They'll have good advice. Good luck!
