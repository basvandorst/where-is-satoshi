Haha yes, Joe is more of a sensationalist than a real journalist. I still occasionally read his stuff, though.

Eh, whatever.  He's one of those stopped clocks, which allows him to be right twice a day.  And he's good at pointing out those successes to people.
If he thinks it's a "bubble," then I'd like to ask him exactly what he thinks a bitcoin is worth.  And what does he think a gold bar is worth?  And why?  If being truthful, he'd probably say that gold is in a 10,000 year bubble.

Damn. Until now, I actually had some faith in Coinbase's security.
Then again, this guy seems legit, and maybe Facebook's many security failures were out of his control.  Lets hope so.

This is true. All that happens is that the computers on IRS's end run a few quick checks to make sure blanks are filled in and that some basic numbers add up. Right now, I'd bet that those computers think that OP's bitcoins are just stock shares of some corporation named "BITCOIN."

This article is better than most.  Whether eventually proven correct or not, he makes some good points (actually more than 4 points). To summarize them into one point, he simply believes that bitcoin cannot become legit until it becomes legit in the eyes of the financial complex.  
While that would certainly create more widespread adoption, he is incorrect in thinking that it is at all necessary.  Bitcoins will continue to exist just fine, even if only as grey and black market tools.  And even if only for that purpose, $10B in market cap is far smaller than its eventual size will become.  I've seen an estimate that the unregulated grey money economy of the world would has a value of around $1T.

Yep.

And then get completely bailed out by taxpayers, who themselves have no say in the matter.

Neither does he.

He's not *really* running for President, despite any news you might read to the contrary.  He knows he can't win.  He's running to push Hillary to the left on some issues, like Wall Street bailouts, elective wars, and NSA spying.  Save your Bitcoins.  He doesn't need much money for this purpose.

There is no point in voting any more after the Citizens United decision.  All ongoing elections will be won by whichever pol has the most campaign money.  And that will always be a Republican or a Democrat.  There is no realistic path to fix this.

Regulars might appreciate it.

If you didn't sell anything in 2014 then my understanding is that you don't yet have a taxable event.  And to be clear, I also believe that buying an $85 item with bitcoin is in fact the selling of x amount of bitcoin, and then paying cash for the item.  As far as the IRS cares.  These are my beliefs and they may not be correct.

Forbes is increasingly producing these low-quality, click-bait type articles. It's kind of sad, really. While I'm sure that it produces a temporary revenue boost, seems like the damage their brand over time would be greater. Maybe not though. 
@_date: 2013-09-02 17:43:36
Thank you for the good info. However, the distinction has no weight to me. If Forbes slaps their name on it, then they claim it and own it. They aren't a search engine, like Google. Whether they contract for content or hire it directly doesn't mean anything to me, their consumer.

Yes, it is.  Blodget has been around and seen it all.  He's just honestly pointing out the risks as he sees them, and probably holding a significant chuck of Bitcoins himself.  And all these "you're either for us or against us" type posts in r/Bitcoin indicate a lack of financial maturity.  I'm older than most Bitcoiners here in Reddit, and I've seen it too.  I've had a large personal investment (Rule 144 security) go up 3800% only to crash back down to about %250 before I could get out.  To have the first fortune I ever made disappear like that left me crying.  These bubbles are real when you're dealing with something that is as hard to value as Bitcoin.  Some of these r/Bitcoiners are striking back at any mild criticism with Holy fervor, and that is itself a warning sign.

Thank you for sharing.  Your experience is valuable in helping teach others the importance of strong security when large amounts of money are involved.
A lot of emotionally insecure folks here love to smugly blame the victim, and that is unfortunate.  Just ignore them, and learn from what happened.  
BTW, if you are never able to really figure out how it happened, I would wipe all your devices that might have been involved and start anew.  It might simply be Mt Gox's fault, but you may never know.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:22:18
Exactly. All the rest of the worries are just a bunch of hand waving.  Should the governments of the world start making it illegal, that may actually result in *increased* value.  The real risk is that there is an unseen flaw or vulnerability somewhere in the process.  I've researched this enough to stake my Bitcoin flag in the ground, as have others who have much more money to lose than me.  But the risk, although probably small, is still there, and as Bitcoin continues to grow massively, the incentive to cheat it or break it will also grow massively.

First line in the article:
"Inflation is widely reviled as a kind of tax on modern life"
They only say that because it is a tax on modern life. 
Although generally too pernicious to be immediately perceived by most.

I don't think that this matters as much as it did a few years ago.  Android has become far more usable these days, and is I think nearly as simple as an iPhone, especially if you confine yourself to the simple things that most iPhone users do with their phones.  As for the complicated stuff, well, you can't do complicated stuff with an iPhone, so I guess there is no comparison.

Them shunk-shunk machines weren't no bigger den a squirrel. Mmmmm-hm.

Sorry to take so long to reply to you.  My answer is basically that making something illegal increases the scarcity of that thing per unit.  Think of the price of marijuana, an extremely easy-to-grow plant that should be worth something like maybe $1 per ounce once industrial growing techniques are applied, but instead sells for far, far higher than that, because it is illegal.  You also pointed out the gold example.  So that's my simple answer.  But DUALLY, this particular thing, has this neat attribute of being more cheaply and covertly transportable than any other thing of value in the world, ever.  There has never been, and may never be, a better way to conceal the transfer of money.  I'll grant that some other alternative crypto currencies may possibly be even more concealable, but I'll cross that bridge when we get there.  :)
