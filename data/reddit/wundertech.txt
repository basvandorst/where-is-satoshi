Yep. If it is increased too much you'll need a monster connection to sync with the block chain. Because of this the average Joe won't be able to set up a node. Also it doesn't even fix the problem that much. If the currency goes mainstream we are looking at a perhaps 10 orders of magnitude increase in transaction frequency. Increasing the block size is a drop compared to the ocean we need to fix the issue.

If someone has a very large holding of bitcoin, it is possible they can drop it all at once and crash the market. People see the price dropping and panic-sell their holding which would lead to a more widespread crash. Alternatively, people may recognise that it is just a single person selling off, and realise that it is a good opportunity to buy some cheap coins.
I believe as the price goes up, people with large holdings are more likely to sell a part of their holdings, gradually, to prevent bitcoin from taking up a large proportion of their investment portfolio. Once we get to 100k, there probably won't be as many large holdings.

I don't think you will see much coersion between the crypto factions until there is one obvious solution to scalability. If the lightning network is as successful as it is touted to be, then I think you'll see everyone falling in place behind it.

The old adage rings true: don't invest more in btc than you are willing to lose. You're not willing to lose $1m. Are you willing to lose $250k? If so, leave that much in.

This question gets asked more often than any other question.

A zero fee transaction wouldn't be a very effective spam attack seeing as miners pick transactions with the highest fees and process them first.

This is now petty infighting. All you are doing is damaging crypto.

Coins don't physically exist anywhere. Bitcoin is just a record of who own what amounts of bitcoin. Hardware wallets store a private key - a number which is used to verify the fact that you own the bitcoins associated with the public key stored on the transaction history.

Instead of paying with cash or a card, you would just use your phone/device to scan a QR code and send through your payment. The recipient will then receive a notification showing that they've received the money.

Wouldn't a payment channel between many people require some sort of central authority to keep track of who has claim to the bitcoin?

The whole idea behind bitcoin is that the system serves everyone, not just the rich.

Every bitcoin is stored in a wallet, even the bitcoin on coinbase - it's just stored in their own wallet.
The reason why you should create your own wallet is because it guarantees there is only one person in the world with access to those bitcoin - you.
If you hold bitcoin on an exchange then the exchange can take your bitcoin from you. It would be illegal to do so, but it is possible. If a hacker compromises the exchange, which has happened before, the hacker can steal the bitcoin you hold on that exchange. If this happens, there is nothing you can do to get it back. No law suit has the capability to reverse a bitcoin transaction, it just isn't possible.

You can hold Bitcoin in exchanges but we don't recommend it as the exchange controls your bitcoin. If you put it in your own wallet, only you can control your bitcoin.

In order to be awarded the block reward and any transaction fees, the miner has to confirm all of the transactions in the block.
