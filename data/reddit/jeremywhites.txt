I use myetherwallet to buy eth.

It would only happen if he is to sell all those bitcoins. Otherwise it would not affect the pool at all.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:44:53
Supply will decrease, thus the price should sky rocket. This is the plain version.
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:40:05
A good day indeed, remember it. It would go down history, whether as the genesis of a future mainstream, or not.

Whoever this entity was, he served his purpose, and is no longer needed to be active. He is now a legend of the past, a ghost of a now passing age. You cannot deny that in the time of sorrow he brought fate back on the table. If this had happened some thousand and half to two thousand years ago, this thing would have had the potential to be a religion.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:40:02
Futuristic, but lets not forget that people were dreaming of bitcoin reaching 1k USD 10 years ago.

Financial consulting in an investment fund.

Hehe, thanks for story!
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:02:59
They are not against bitcoin, its just financially not feasible for anyone having in mind the insane transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-01-30 07:56:19
This is like highy speculative, and not really backed well by any fact.
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:09:44
The best thing no matter how much money I have made out of crypto, is the knowledge that I acquired and in the end landed me a pretty good job. All thanks to crypto!

Besides stating the obvious, not much is said here. What he is asking is whether or not he should invest his savings with a hope of return in the futures. And most people would advice him to do so, based on the trend so far Bitcoin has been doing very, well and people only expect it to continue rising up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:08:26
I believe that what is currently happening is that we are witnessing a pump and dump strategy, which will boost Bcash and latter crash it by a huge dump. I have other reasons to believe that ETH is going to rise as well soon.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:36:37
Witnessing a huge crash of the market is becoming more and more likely. Usually high volatility markets never reach such high numbers. This is quite a fiasco for any sane financial interpreter. Have in mind that many companies are now allowing bitcoin futures to their clients, this definitely is a red lamp to most of us who know what this means.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:37:53
I love that. You can hodl you bicoin while hodling to your willie. Have fun hodling.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:59:45
Good job, if I were you I would put in a frame, and hodl it on the wall for the next 30-40 years, when finally a crypto museum would be open, and donate it for the public to see why you are a millionaire in 2050.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:53:35
You should get one despite the price mate, just like we all got.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:52:43
Its all in your head, once you get used to it you will feel the same way towards prices of thousands of any currency.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:45:14
Around $10-15 bucks. You should have mined more. But i guess mining has never been easy, just ask you grandpa.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:26:48
But that's what people think, and in a free market, its what people think and do, that dictate the prices.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:16:16
Yes but regulation could backfire just like in 2007, when due to regulations and links a crash In one market led to the crash of a whole system. It also takes decentralization out of the equation. The whole idea of de-centro crypto currencies is for them to be a completely free market driven.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:21:38
Being such a volatile commodity, it is only normal to have its cycles of dips and growths. But the truth is that the fanatic following bitcoin has is the single most trustworthy factor that would ensure that bitcoins continues to grow at least for some time in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:52:07
Well futures is an instrument, with which you can hedge your risk, I.E. reduce your risk of hypothetical crash by agree upon a price ahead of time. Yes many use it as a mechanism to short current growth, but we didn't need any shorting instruments, due to sheer volatility. The thing is that futures is never an option unless there is an increased chance of a crash.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:33:46
We don't need any of that. Bitcoin has a good logo- recognizeable, simple etc. Think of the Dollar sign, does it need to be improved - NO.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:11:26
This is a huge turnoff for everybody. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:05:16
All is very true, I myself took the niche of a middleman, and that's how I make my money nowadays.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:18:41
Haha, that's how it is, having people with no clue running a free market. Enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:43:38
This a bit contrary to what the philosophy behind bitcoin is in general. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:14:35
We don't need anymore growth. This constant growth refrains people from using bitcoin as a currency, because there is the constant notion that it might grow tomorrow into something more, because of this everybody is holding on to it like a raft In an financial river that has no ending, but rather endless stream of currents.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:36:20
Stolen doesn't mean that they are lost. But yes people die, and their BTC go with them unless someone from the family has access to them.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:58:05
Very accurately described, it is called pump-and-dump. Nothing innovational, I consider it to be quite a dirty thing to do. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:06:37
Use it to achieve leverage, not to buy cars.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:19:30
You know, that exactly what I have been thinking to my self. Logic suggests that it should drop, but the social factor has to do a great deal, and I'm starting to believe that we are at the verge of even greater growth due to popularity rising.
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:36:38
It is actually scary how accurate my prediction came to be. Logic prevailed and the social factor attributed to a great growth.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:22:42
Every bust happens because of a reason. Simply saying that it has happened to something, doesn't mean that there is rational to fear at currently. As a matter of fact it is rather different from anything we have seen so far. We have never had a decentralized financial instrument, ever.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:46:32
I sold 50% and now I'm waiting for the right time to buy in with the rest. I'm aiming at the best margin possible. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:28:32
Its the milestone not the value.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:14:42
Still it is reasonable to wait for a dip, so you can buy into a bit cheaper, and afterwards when to sell and at what price it is all up to you.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:09:20
That's exactly what is going to happen, most of the people holding bitcoins, have prepared money on the  side and are just waiting for the right moment to come. This means that any dip would be eaten  out by market mechanics in a matter of hours.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:44:00
No wonder, but it is not feasible with everyone. Some peoples strategies are just too optimized for convetional markets, and adjusting to bitcoin is a bit tricky, as it is not as liquid at the high end.
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:10:21
It is only through the growth of the industry, that we could ensure a sustained future for the crypto currencies. Just imagine in 15-20 years we could have USA presidential candidates lobbying for the crypto industry. Fiction nowadays could turn reality just the near future.
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:21:44
I think that we are currently in a state when bitcoin is becoming more mainsteam than ever. More and more people are getting in Bitcoin as a whole, which means that demand is actually growing. This could ensure us some pretty stable rise in prices in the future to come.
I personally believe that more articles should be made that popularize bitcoin and crypto currencies, this way we can ensure our "investments". In that spirit take a glance if you feel like it at this piece 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:57:41
That's why if you want to earn off price increase in crypto currencies, you have to keep investments longterm (meaning more than an year)
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:55:54
I would rather disagree, because those are companies that are actually profiting from such operations, and profits are taxed. Also there is the argument that once cryptocurrency is accepted as a regular mean of trade, all the mining facilities would actually produce wealth meaning that GDP would rise as well.
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:52:24
Of course nothing happened. Who would believe anything else.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:03:30
Hahahahahaha... ;( . Such a sad meme I don't really understand why is it so, not as if I bought at 10k and didn't sell at 19k..
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:51:03
That's what dumping is called, and no he would not do it, unless he wishes to crash bitcoin, which is rather unlikely for anyone who owns any substantial amount of bitcoins, for it would be a loss for them.
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:51:43
You need to take quite a lot of things into consideration. Calculating your risk is a lot harder, you need to have a very precise formula concerning price fluctuations, and you need quite some brainstorming to protect against fraud. It is not impossible but I suggest to try some hybridization in terms of instrumental currency.
