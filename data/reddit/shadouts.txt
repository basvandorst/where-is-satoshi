Your argument for using a blockchain is for increased security. If you want security, why wouldn't you use the most secure blockchain? Need permissioned and customized transactions, why not just make use of OP_RETURN using officially approved keys?

I'm not experienced with using BitGo, but sending a key anywhere on the Internet sounds like the worst idea ever. Is this recovery key a backup of the private key? If it's not a phishing attempt, then it's still bad security.

Well, if a user freely provides a key in an insecure fashion to a bad actor, multisig security becomes moot.
BitGo holds the third key. If they, or a bad actor inside their organization, gain access to one of the other two, maybe by a user freely giving it to them, then they can sign transactions without permission from another keyholder.

How to freeze a wallet if you never signed up at BitGo?
I remember the trading wallet had a popup for me a few months ago asking me to approve and get registered at BitGo. I didn't like that idea, and I didn't trade that way anyhow and it never had me agree to that popup when I would only stay on the exchange wallet. Is this why my coins are still in my exchange wallet?

I guess my point is that this doesn't promote bitcoin very well. It doesn't bring in new users. It's only useful for those that already have bitcoin. Also, merchants aren't exposed to the benefits of bitcoin. I see it as a wrong direction for bitcoin payments. It will only further entrench merchants into their debit card comfort zone.

Sybil can change all the nodes she wants to scrypt, completely outnumbering miner nodes if she wants, but the miners will continue on with sha256 and people will continue accepting blocks from those miners because a block is the only thing real in bitcoin and the only thing that transfers value.
@_date: 2017-02-08 23:44:43
Technically you are correct, however, invalid chains don't last very long and will be replaced by a valid chain with more chainwork. 48 hours is sufficient for this to work itself out.
@_date: 2017-02-01 03:56:14
There is know way to know how many wallets there are. And when it comes to addresses, one person creates many. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:59:09
Yes, the point of Bitcoin is zero trust, but you run your own node to validate the work done by miners. If your node does not follow the same security model of Bitcoin, then you will reject all blocks and never be able to move value.
Miners can stick with anything they want and you will have to use it if you want to be able to move bitcoins, and this is good. It's cheap to spin up 20k nodes to fake support for a network policy. It's expensive to prove you've burned energy to support a network policy.
@_date: 2017-02-12 19:59:27
You're so backwards. If you want your coins to move, you will do what you need to do to get miners to see your transaction and include it in a block. Nodes don't serve blocks to miners, miners serve blocks to nodes. If you're not listening to what miners mine, then you're gonna have a bad time.
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:54:56
Every non-mining node is owned by Sybil. Nodes don't and shouldn't matter. And nobody used bitcoin when all the nodes were miners. It didn't make it any less Bitcoin. The security of bitcoin is that the real chain is the cryptographically valid chain with the most chainwork. Anything else breaks this security.
@_date: 2017-02-08 23:20:16


This isn't worded well. Difficulties don't change in 48 hour periods, and difficulty doesn't accumulate. They should have specified chainwork since that essentially is what they seem to be getting at.
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:36:13
Nodes don't matter with Bitcoin, only mining nodes. If you aren't using coins on the cryptographically valid chain with most work, then you aren't using bitcoin. This is how it works. It's in the code. It's not a matter of opinion. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 20:20:57
I run a full node and I know that I can set max block size variable to be whatever I want it to be, yet, it won't have any affect on the blocks that get mined which move my coins.

Bitcoin doesn't even fit into legacy concepts of money or value. It's too weird. Nothing is really transferred. Accounts don't exist, and even if they did, value isn't input into them until the moment in which it is output. How would a timelock transaction be accounted? At what point is that counted as a "gain".

I really haven't looked much into the details of how an ethereum contract works, but my understanding is that each transaction (calculation) that a method performs for a return value must "pay" a certain amount of ETH to the mining network. You load your contract up with ETH, launch it, and it operates until it runs out of fuel.
None of this really matters, though. If you create a really powerful and valuable contract capable of perpetuating itself, Vitalik might undo all your profits if he accidentally invests in it and loses money.

Sorry man, I comprehend the economics of block size just fine. I just disagree with your point. Fees won't rise infinitely.

Yes, it's unfortunate that bitcoin vendors like Coinbase are burdened with this sort of task, but in the future it will become infeasible to monitor everyone's bitcoin use when nobody cares about the past of their coins.

You have it backwards. Segwit allows more riders on the same bus (potentially 3x), it does not make the bus bigger.
In real terms, it lets more transactions fit inside one megabyte because each transaction is less bytes and validating a block takes less computation power.

Why would you ever put yourself in a situation to assume that the IRS wouldn't audit you? The IRS is an irrational organization on it's own. Don't let your guard down when you deal with irrational organizations. Don't trust that they'll give you anything. Don't try to anticipate their moves. It's only your own fault if you put yourself in a situation where you had to trust an outside organization to do things one way or another.

Don't use Circle as a bitcoin wallet.
The only complaint I ever get from friends which prevents them from using Circle is, "Why won't you let me send to you with Venmo." In which I respond, "Can Venmo send bitcoins to my personal wallet?"
@_date: 2016-09-15 22:31:55
If you use Circle to sell bitcoin, it's also a few dollars higher and you gain, so maybe it's just the algorithm they use to calculate market price.

It's not an issue to those running full nodes. It's an issue for miners. While they are downloading and validating a block they cannot mine the next one and the one who discovered the previous block gets a head start.

With most checking/debit cards, you aren't liable for fraudulent charges and can usually get them reversed. This might piss off Circle, but it's the price they pay for dealing in reversible payment methods.

I like this idea as I'm a big fan of paper wallets. With a hardware wallet, you still have to back it up on paper. Nobody knows the longevity of those things. Plus, I need lots and lots of wallets. Printing bitaddress.org has been my way to go. But, I can get a $30 inkjet and print all the wallets I want. How can it be done better?
I don't really want a tamper proofed sticker or any fancy colors. These things are going into safety deposit boxes. I'd say focus on the key generation software. Bitaddress.org isn't ideal.

Blocks are only about 1.5 minutes late right now. This doesn't add up to 24hrs in 24hrs time. This only adds up to 3.6 hours in 144 blocks.
Unfull blocks is evidence that miners don't think there are mining fees worth their time to fill the block up.

$3/btc is 0.5%, but if you send bitcoin to a Circle account that is still denominated in dollars, it's about the same amount (0.5% greater). I think their price algo is just screwy.

After further thought, I think this might be a good way for large sites like this to test the waters for adoption. By randomly changing the title of elements for a known percentage of users, you could measure how much it increases the "clicks" on that particular element.

If you're a miner, it's not hype but rather a harsh reality.

Wallet != address. Also, generating an address does not put it on the blockchain if it has been unused.
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:41:02
Don't buy the memory issue to be the worry about centralization. The blockchain is only 70gigs and even with 2MB blocks, it would only be about 170gigs bigger next year (if they were all full). Memory is cheap these days.
The worry of centralization has to do with network propagation. A 2MB block takes longer for your mining node to download, so being a miner that publishes less blocks, you'd have a disadvantage. A solution to block propagation is already being worked on.

I had high hopes for ethereum. I liked the idea of immutable smart contracts. I believed in a technology that could eliminate lawyers, accountants, and legalese for certain applications. Their actions just ensured that these types will have to stick around forever to determine the "Spirit of the Smart Contract". And when the lawyers shout, "Bug! This company deserves a bailout." Then the most powerful miners will be able to vote to bailout the bank run by a smart contract. Hardforking perpetuates the problem that the philosophy was trying to solve

An investor may be taking those 25 out of circulation for the time being, but it's not safe to make investments assuming that those 25 won't suddenly hit the market.
At the same time, people who claim to be forgetters might just be lying in order to help pump the price up for those that make investments assuming a certain number of coins are gone forever.
I also don't believe lost coins paints a good picture of bitcoin to those not in the know.
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:13:21
