The reasoning behind making the algorithm "slower" is to make asics less common?

1.) What does a single "mining process" look like?
(Example: Load X; Load Y; Bitcoin = X + Y;)
2.) Why are SHA256 asics generally getting way higher hashrates than SCRYPT asics?

What exactly went wrong?

So if I spend some bitcoins on XT on a block larger than 1mb, my bitcoins remain unspent on the "bitcoin-core-chain"?

I actually "built" a Brent-Kung adder myself in minecraft, and yes its amazing to seen how the carries get calculated without ever needing to wait for a propagate signal that would slow the thing down. Thank you for your answer though, do you maybe have a good read on this?
@_date: 2015-02-17 17:37:27
Where would I need to ask that?

He is very likely on mobile, it shows a 404-error on my S5 (BaconReader) too.

What kind of adder architecture is commonly used in ASIC's? (Brent Kung, CLA, CLE, Ladner-Fischer,...) ?
Sorry if this is a noobquestion.

Yeah I dont get why people would simply downvote instead of trying to help you, or at least ignore ur comment if they dont have the same problem.
