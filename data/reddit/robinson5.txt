Yeah have they explained what happened with their cold storage with BitGo yet?
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:35:38
I didn't know those exchanges had such high volume
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:42:39
I've been told that they are collecting fees on bfx token trading which is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:41:24
They should at least release how many tokens they've given out in total
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:23:28
Did they take 36% from USD balances as well or just bitcoin and altcoins?
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:33:02
Good point.  I just realized though that according to coinmarketcap itbit, and btc-e have higher volumes than bitfinex which is surprising
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:34:58
I just noticed that too on coinmarketcap.  I didn't realize btc-e had such high USD volume
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:34:08
That's absolutely ridiculous that they are collecting money on their debt tokens
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:22:45
I think it's in the community's best interest for Bitfinex to fail. Companies shouldn't be rewarded for terrible security
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:24:32
Exactly.  Without an audit maybe the hacker stole much less (if there even was a hack).  People shouldn't just trust this 36% without an audit.
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:34:36
Why do you think so? Compared to other exchanges
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:25:18
Exactly! I can't believe they still have so much USD to BTC trading!
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:27:33
I don't understand? You think paying a higher fee solves the capacity problem.
If every wallet calculated the fee to get into the next block correctly, then it would raise unbounded forever.  You do realize that right? There is no correct fee it is a myth
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:49:32
Aren't nodes still important though? If miners were all running BU and nodes mostly all running Segwit wouldn't that be a problem? (or the other way around?)
@_date: 2017-02-07 00:12:12
This has been a point I have made repeatedly.  Blockstream is doing exactly that, taking the position of "my way or nothing".  People don't trust Blockstream to do a hard fork blocksize increase later on.  And that is why Segwit should be packaged with a hard fork.  But Blockstream won't budge no matter what.  I don't think anything will reach consensus if it is not a compromise.  But Blockstream does not want a compromise.  Look at the HK agreement, they scrapped it immediately 
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:25:31
Exactly, the HK agreement was though.  But u/nullc has said it doesn't matter that the president of his company signed it
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:22:32
hashing power can't be faked though :)
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:38:11
Blockstream could allow signalling for a 2mb max blocksize increase that wouldn't activate until it has enough consensus.  It is totally possible don't believe the lies
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:01:00
Blockstream Core absolutely has the power to block hard fork proposals.  Maybe not directly, but look at their actions.  They remove Gavin's commit access.  They attack and ban any companies that support big blocks or other implementations besides Core.  So don't argue that people could use other devs' implementations.  Blockstream Core claim that only Core is bitcoin and they attack any one else that doesn't agree with them.  Businesses are unable to do anything about it because of Core retaliation.  Look at coinbase.
The market will eventually decide and Blockstream will die out.  Bitcoin will continue to improve
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:21:11
Don't forget to add that core hash rate dropped below 80% by the end of the month!
@_date: 2017-02-01 00:59:48
Yes I chose to say 48% wasn't a lot because this post was saying that segwit had a lot of approval.  48% is still far away from 95%.  If someone posted this same picture in r/btc celebrating the node count I would comment that 5.5% is not a lot
@_date: 2017-02-08 23:00:58
But you aren't free to talk about bigger blocks here without getting censored or banned
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:05:06
Yes, and it also allows anyonecanspend transactions.  We could have hardforked for a blocksize increase years ago rather than waiting for segwit.  But blockstream did everything in their power to censor and ban companies and devs that supported bigger blocks
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:10:38
Blockstream signed the HK agreement, the company and therefore you have everything to do with this.
If Blockstream wanted to follow what they signed, they would code a 2mb hardfork.  No "preliminary code" or rough ideas.  Actual, ready to go code.
Edit: And you have repeatedly said that Blockstream/Core has upheld their end of the agreement.  I can't wrap my head around how you are able to say that when there is no 2mb hard fork code.  You have tried to count Luke's BIP as fulfilling the agreement when it made blocks smaller instead of larger
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:29:23
doesn't matter the reason Adam signed as president.  Blockstream tried to trick the miners by signing as individuals so they could back out of the agreement later.  Adam ended up signing as President (don't know if this is true since I've only heard this from you).
But it doesn't matter.  The President of your company signed an agreement which has not been uphold.  And which you have no intention of following through.  A 2mb hardfork code was promised.  There is none.  How are you arguing that the agreement was upheld? No amount of spin can make that true.
All the HK agreement did was show that Blockstream is a completely illegitimate company.  What kind of startup would receive 10s of millions when an employee calls the President a dipshit and has complete disregard for documents that the President signed?  He speaks for Blockstream as a whole and Blockstream has not coded a 2mb hard fork
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:55:49
Yes, that is because Greg has said fees would drop to zero if there is space in the blocks.  Even though for almost all of bitcoin's history there has been free space and non zero fees, he is insistent fees will be zero if there is space.  It is crazy
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:36:38
I see what you're saying.  Yes, it wouldn't be the "fee market" Greg wants but a true fee market
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:20:40
We could have done it years ago, BashCo's point was miners are wrong in not activating segwit and need to get their act together.  I'm pointing out that if many people don't agree with him, maybe he should consider he is wrong rather than saying everyone else is making the wrong decision
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:53:10
Blockstream signed an agreement promising to code a hardfork.  They can code this they just don't want to.
@_date: 2017-02-01 00:51:45
Hahaha that's amazing!
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:36:43
No I'm me :)
@_date: 2017-02-07 00:01:26
unfortunately Blockstream thinks the solution to the problem is to pay the estimated fee.  If everyone does that fees will eventually be 10% and rising
@_date: 2017-02-06 16:56:40
anyonecanspend transactions would be a huge risk if only 25% miners were using segwit and only 50% of nodes enforcing it.
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:20:09
the 2mb hardfork could also fix the quadratic problem.  And I don't think arguing that it takes too much time for a hard fork is a valid argument.  Segwit has taken much longer than a simple hard fork would have taken.
In addition, you can't say there isn't consensus for a hardfork if Blockstream/Core doesn't even allow to see if there is consensus.
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:02:37
Telling the same lie that the President of your company didn't sign the agreement won't make it true either, Greg.  And proposals aren't the same as a 2mb hardfork being in Core code.  And Luke's BIP DOES NOT fulfill the HK agreement in the slightest.  It makes the blocks 70% smaller, that is not the same as 100% larger
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:17:15
Yeah it's so ridiculous they don't understand how it only works on an individual level.  If a big chunk of people did it then fees would keep rising forever and ever.
The best solution by far would be too get rid of the transaction backlog and the fee market in entirety.  Get bitcoin working the way it always was before blockstream.  u/nullc likes to say that fees would be zero if there wasn't a transaction backlog but this has NEVER been the case.  Fees have never been zero and until recently there was never full blocks and a transaction backlog.  I don't understand how people believe whatever he says
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:23:21
Could just active bigger blocks with a hardfork and move on.  Instead they gotta do things the hard way :)
That's why it's better to compromise.  Which was the point of the HK agreement but blockstream has not kept their word
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:09:40
Exactly.  A hardfork to increase the blocksize is completely doable if done with enough organization and time
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:09:04
I've talked about this too, check out my post here: 
Unfortunately, I don't think blockstream/core will ever be willing to compromise and do both segwit and a 2mb max blocksize increase.  They just refuse to budge.  If neither side compromises then nothing will ever reach 95%.  I think BU people would be willing to compromise for a max blocksize increase along with segwit.  But Blockstream will never code that
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:05:58
If Blockstream would allow a fork with segwit AND a bigger max blocksize then I think consensus would be reached quickly.  Unfortunately they have no intention of doing this so I think we will be stuck in a stalemate forever.  Both sides need to compromise
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:59:59
No I didn't, I just haven't responded to it yet.  If you don't believe me, I'm actually too dumb at reddit to figure out how to do the quote thing.  I just actually quote people using quotation marks.  Look at all my posts if you'd like.  Just because I don't agree with you doesn't make me a shill.  Classic Greg style of thinking :)
First of all, preliminary code is not the same thing as a fully coded hard fork ready to go.  Also, you can't be serious that Luke's BIP counts as fulfilling the HK agreement.  In another post I wrote how Luke's BIP was another f*** you to miners from Blockstream, in which you responded that it had nothing to do with Blockstream.  Now it's fulfilling the HK agreement promised by Blockstream? Interesting.
I'm not making dishonest misrepresentations of the agreement.  Blockstream promised that they would code a 2mb hardfork.  They have not done so.  It is actually quite simple.  You're the one adding a lot of complexity trying to spin it as Blockstream following it
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:39:30
This just shows how far u/nullc propaganda spreads.  How can you say we will always have full blocks? If we never increase capacity then yes (unless bitcoin dies and then we won't have full blocks).
But throughout almost all of bitcoin's life we didn't have full blocks and everything was fine.  But now that all mighty Greg says we will always have full blocks you believe it?
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:04:43
CPFP and RBF are cool features but they are not solutions.  All they do is help make bigger problems less of a hassle.  A real solution would be getting rid of the transaction backlog and the 4x higher fees we have now.  This needs to be done by scaling bitcoin.  That is the only real solution
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:11:52
If blockstream wasn't hypocritical this would be labeled contentious but they don't care if it's for something they want.  In my opinion, nothing should be done soft fork or hard fork if it doesn't have 95% consensus
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:37:58
Ah blockstream hypocrisy.  48% is less than a simple majority yet you wouldn't consider that contentious?
And this post was in r/bitcoin so it was clearly implying that there was a lot of segwit nodes.  I'm saying 48% is no where near enough
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:00:04
Just because miners don't agree with you doesn't make their decision "political".  It could be because they just don't agree with Blockstream Core.
And if blockstream never intended on coding a 2mb hardfork then they shouldn't have signed an agreement saying they would
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:10:12
Or we could have done it years ago with a hardfork rather than continuously delaying it with talk of segwit that didn't materialize until recently.
And have you ever considered that maybe if so many miners don't agree with you that you might be wrong? Rather than everyone else just needing to "get their acts together"?
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:52:22
you mean blockstream's contractors you didn't want to count as working for blockstream?
@_date: 2017-02-01 00:50:50

@_date: 2017-02-06 17:07:21
Thanks! Wouldn't the anyonecanspend transactions be a problem if so many of the nodes weren't using segwit?
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:12:02
No, you are lying about this agreement once again.  Multiple times you have said that people signed as individuals.  This is false.  No matter how many times you say it it doesn't make it true.
Adam Back signed as the President of Blockstream.  You called him a dipshit.  You told me "whoptie do" that one person signed as the company.  This CLEARLY matters.  Stop pretending that Blockstream had nothing to do with the HK agreement.  The president of your company signed it! And nothing has been done on your end.
Just more lies from you.  The compromise proposed was not just segwit.  This is false.  The compromise was segwit and 2mb hardfork code.  How are you possibly saying the HK agreement was just for segwit? And you don't understand why people don't trust blockstream or you? You constantly lie and now you're saying people signed as individuals and it was just for segwit?
I know you have a superiority complex but it doesn't allow you to choose your facts.
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:12:24
They shouldn't have signed an agreement promising to do so
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:14:41
So hypocritical.  All you need is greater than 50% and you consider that successful?
I'm not at all advocating that BU activate now.  Unlike you, who is saying that segwit has enough which is incredibly false.  Neither has enough to not be contentious.  That's why I think blockstream should stop being so stubborn and just compromise
@_date: 2017-02-08 22:57:42
How did theymos get recognized as an awesome moderator? Hasn't the CEO of reddit said he considers r/bitcoin to be a problem?
@_date: 2017-02-07 00:05:36
This is a point I have made in the past.  Consensus would be reached much quicker if a compromise was made.  I think most people would love segwit if it also came with dynamic block size controls/flex cap or even just a block size increase to 2 mb.  But Blockstream/Core has not done any meaningful work on this and I don't think they plan to
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:50:46
Yeah I think that would be great! A true compromise is needed and segwit as a hard fork would be much better.  It's amazing to me how stubborn Blockstream is that they just won't compromise no matter what.  Their inability to work with others will be the end of them
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:21:52
Segwit as a soft fork is much different than CSV.  If there are too many nodes/miners that haven't upgraded it is a risk to the network.  Because of the change in transaction format it would not be good if it was activated at only 50%.
I'll say it again, I'm not advocating BU activate now.  Also, 50% of nodes for segwit is not enough, especially considering there is less than 25% hashing power
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:25:06
Or Blockstream could follow through with the HK agreement they signed and allow segwit and a 2mb max blocksize hardfork.  This way the update will reach consensus.  If they refuse to compromise nothing will ever happen
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:39:30
Yes, when people say pay the right fee and you won't have to wait, this advice does not work nor will it ever work while we have full blocks.  No amount of extra fees causes more capacity.  If too many people listen to your advice it wouldn't work.  It is not a solution
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:44:12
Think what you'd like but blockstream is slowly losing their control
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:25:57
I guess we're saying kind of the same thing :)
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:00:47
Then the president of blockstream shouldn't have signed something promising to code a hardfork
@_date: 2017-02-06 21:57:21
Facts: President of Blockstream signs the HK agreement as the president of blockstream (not as an individual).  Greg calls him a dipshit, blockstream has no intention of following through on what they signed.  Which was a 2mb max blocksize hard fork
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:05:51
And bitcoin's code.  Unless you count Unlimited as bitcoin.  But blockstream core say only Core is the true bitcoin.  I've talked about this hypocrisy in another thread
@_date: 2017-02-08 23:03:13
That's the thing.  It's not just promoting software that's banned.  It's anything that is against Blockstream.  It is anyone for bigger blocks (even for just talking about them, not about BU).
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:09:07
I already did :) Preliminary code doesn't fulfill the HK agreement.
Why don't you follow this link? 
@_date: 2016-03-24 02:20:41
Makes sense although privacy shouldn't be so controversial.  Do you have a good resource where I could read up on all the sides of the blocksize debate?  And if blockstream is making Elements and Liquid does that require bitcoin to incorporate them? Or can they work without Core's involvement? I don't see why blockstream is working on these sidechains if nothing is going to come from them but I don't honestly really know what blockstream is all about.
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:03:36
Yeah I don't understand how people's response is always to just pay the fee.  That does not solve the problem and it never will.
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:17:05
No there does not need to be a fee market and a constant back log.  If there are enough on chain transactions then that will cover the block subsidy being halved.  Bigger blocks would allow more transactions.  More transactions with normal fees before blockstream would be enough to secure the network.  There is absolutely no need to have a constant transaction backlog and full blocks for the network to be secure
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:51:32
Um look at coinbase maybe?
@_date: 2017-02-08 23:14:56
People felt that there is a lot of censorship in this subreddit if you say anything that is negative about the people that currently hold the most power in the bitcoin ecosystem.  So they started a different subreddit.  People that like this one claim that r/btc is filled with nonsense.  I think it's good to check both since many things will never appear here.
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:43:55
That is why I said if there are enough on chain transactions to make up for the lack of block reward.  Did you read what I wrote?
In addition, u/nullc is arguing that fees would be zero if there is any free space in the block.  This is absolutely false.  There have never been zero fees 
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:01:24
Don't forget to draw a horizontal line across each of those graphs! We've reached our capacity, that's it we're done.

Okay cool thanks for explaining!
@_date: 2016-03-23 18:30:48
Thanks for the video.  Are confidential transactions already working in bitcoin or one of blockstream's sidechains? Or are they working on implementing it.
@_date: 2017-02-01 00:51:19
Yes, I'm curious.  What are the two contradictory beliefs I have?
@_date: 2016-03-24 14:17:37
So if elements and liquid don't need a fork what needs to happen to get them working in bitcoin as a sidechain? Because right now they don't have bitcoin functionality yet do they?  I see they are in testnet alpha though
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:18:52
I don't agree though.  If there are enough on chain transactions then the normal bitcoin fees (normal until a year or so ago) would be enough to cover the missing block reward.  Fees have never been zero while there is free space in the block.  For 90+% of bitcoin's history there has been free block space, nonzero fees, and no transaction backlog.  If there is more on chain transactions then those same fees will be enough
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:35:51
That would be great I'd like them to do that! I'm agreeing with you.  I'd like either side to add the other side's code so that a compromise can be reached.  Blockstream clearly won't do it so hopefully BU will.  That would be great!
@_date: 2017-02-07 00:04:27
Haha classic spin.  He reduces the blocksize by 70%.  It is by no means a legitimate BIP meant to "preserve alignment between miners and node operators"
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:32:56
Then Blockstream shouldn't have signed an agreement they knew the whole time they couldn't and wouldn't even try to uphold.
"The code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016".  That is from the HK agreement.  Why has Blockstream not coded a 2mb hard fork and recommended it to Core? That was the agreement.  You can say it's a lie but it is not.  Blockstream has not, and never intended to, keep their promise.
Edit: And you do have the ability to make it happen.  Blockstream could code a 2mb hardfork along with segwit.  That was the HK agreement.  You could still do that.  Not wanting to do it is different than not having the ability to do so
@_date: 2017-02-07 00:08:58
There has been Luke-Jr's absolutely ridiculous BIP that lowered the blocksize by 70%.  There has also been some "preliminary" work done.  But in terms of anything meaningful, there has been nothing done in this part of the roadmap.  Which in my opinion, is leading to the lack of consensus.  I don't think anyone in their right mind thinks Blockstream or Core will ever meaningfully do any work on this.  Which is why they want to see it with segwit so both can be activated at once.  Rather than trusting Blockstream to do it later
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:35:38
You're right, Core doesn't need to respect an agreement signed by Blockstream.  But you know who should respect that agreement? Blockstream should.  And Blockstream has not coded a 2mb hardfork even though they signed a document promising they would.  u/nullc will say anything to get out of it such as Blockstream didn't sign it and that they are unable to do anything about it.  All of that is very false.  Adam Back signed as the President of Blockstream and Blockstream could very well spend their millions of dollars on coding a 2mb hard fork.  They just don't want to.  Even though they signed a document promising they would.
@_date: 2016-03-24 15:15:49
Does Blockstream need Core's cooperation to get Confidential Transactions in Elements working on bitcoin's mainnet? Or can the federated escrow and fancier ways be done on their own?  Thanks for your help explaining!
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:41:08
Not really though.  The HK agreement was a compromise and most likely could reach consensus.  Blockstream/core has every ability to make a Core version that flags for segwit with a 2mb max blocksize increase (like the HK agreement said).  They refuse to do this because they don't want to compromise.  A compromise would reach consensus much quicker than just segwit.  It is unfortunate they don't want to do this
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:10:42
So just because increasing the blocksize will help a little but not be able to completely fill all the demand we shouldn't raise it at all? That makes a lot of sense /s.
Why don't we just lower it to 100kb?
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:03:44
Nope, not better never than late.  I'm just telling u/BashCo to not be hypocritical and say we can have it in 2 weeks if miners get their act together.
We could have had a capacity increase years ago if Blockstream got their act together too
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:42:38
You are right, core devs can not force the network.  But blockstream/core basically decides what options people have to vote on.  Right now, it is just segwit.  If they want a scaling solution to reach consensus they should compromise and have an option that is segwit with a 2mb max blocksize increase.  Unfortunately, blockstream will never compromise so nothing will reach consensus
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:54:27
Ugh you knew what I meant.  The comment you wrote was this:
"For a give block size this is true and how the protocol works so there is no discussion about it but if one has to decide on a new or automatic block size with all the data that has to be stored, it unfortunately has to be taken into account and anyone has a right to an opinion."
My point is blockstream is saying it about current transactions.  So if you agree with what you said, then blockstream shouldn't be labeling certain transactions as illegitimate or spam.  It doesn't matter what they think, that's not the point of bitcoin.  If a transaction is valid it is valid.
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:43:40
Why would anyone trust blockstream to code a HF after segwit? Greg has called the president of blockstream a dipshit for signing it, and said it didn't matter that one person signed.  One person being the president of his company.
Both should be done at the same time.  That was the point of a compromise.  Not an empty promise that it will happen at some point
@_date: 2017-01-31 20:23:14
I don't understand how google ads always seem to have so many phishing bitcoin related sites.  Can't google stop these or look at who set them up and report them?
@_date: 2017-01-31 22:31:05
It doesn't matter if blockstream doesn't like some of the transactions.  It's bitcoin.  It is decentralized.  There IS a transaction backlog.  It doesn't matter that Blockstream doesn't think those transactions are legitimate.  There is still a transaction backlog. The transactions are NOT spam just because blockstream thinks they are unimportant.
In your top comment you said that the discussion is irrelevant for current block sizes and it's only important in deciding how large a future block size should be.  Well blockstream is saying now that some transactions are illegitimate and therefore there is no transaction backlog.  This is a problem.  Blockstream shouldn't be judging the validity of people's transactions.  No matter what they say it doesn't change the fact that there is a transaction backlog
@_date: 2017-01-30 22:57:28
It's not spam though! The point of bitcoin is to allow anyone to send anyone else money.  How are we better than the current systems of money if we start allowing Core/Blockstream to decide which transactions count as legitimate or not?

Don't worry though! Blockstream says there is no real transaction backlog it is just all spam.  There are no problems! /s

Wow that's surprising.  Why would they get their money back? If it's phishing it's illegal.  They shouldn't get their money and they should get their name and bank info or credit card (whatever they used to pay) reported to the authorities.
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:10:26
So your logic says that without any argument, evidence, or facts something is going to suddenly change from the way it's been for many many years without any reason at all?
But I lack logic...
@_date: 2017-01-30 23:36:30
But Blockstream/Core says if you don't run Core then you aren't running bitcoin.  Therefore they do control the code that bitcoin users run.
Or they can get off their high horse and admit that BU is still bitcoin and that Blockstream/Core does not control the code.
They can't have it both ways
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:48:28
So what's your evidence that it will change?
It seems pretty odd you're expecting evidence that something will stay the same when it has always been that way.  But you don't require any evidence or facts when someone says that everything will change from how it has always been.
Just because something has the possibility of changing doesn't mean it will.  And the fact that fees have never been zero is a good indicator it will remain that way.  I think evidence and facts are needed to make a good argument that this will change and fees will be zero.
You didn't answer my question: Why do you think fees will be zero even though they never have been?
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:23:21
That's great.  I think low fees are vital to bitcoin and I disagree that we need a fee market for bitcoin to remain secure.  Fees won't drop to zero if there is space in the block.  Transaction backlogs are a relatively new thing and fees weren't zero before scaling became an issue.
If there are enough transactions AND large enough blocks then fees can be low and the network still be secured
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:54:31
Thanks for not reading my post! I know it allows for 2mb blocks.  Like I've said multiple times (but you clearly didn't read) I don't think anything will pass if there is not a compromise.  Segwit and a 2mb max blocksize increase would allow for 4mb blocks.  Blockstreamers would get their segwit and unlimited fans wouldn't get unlimited but they'd get a 2mb max blocksize increase.  I think that if there is a compromise it would reach consensus quickly.  If we approach this from an either/or standoff then I don't think anything will ever reach consensus.
I basically just rewrote everything though.  So next time maybe just read my post?
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:01:01
You're argument makes no sense.  In all of bitcoin's history, fees have never been zero while there was free space in the block.  Now that u/nullc says fees will be zero you believe it just because?
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:17:54
they didn't fork stop spreading misinformation.  Read about it here: 
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:10:06
The fact that it's almost ALWAYS been that way is a pretty good indicator it will continue to remain that way.  I feel like the responsibility of providing evidence would be on the people making claims that it will suddenly be completely different and fees will be zero even though that has never happened...  Why do I need to prove something that has always been the case? Why do you believe fees will be zero even though they never have been?
@_date: 2017-01-30 22:01:15
Would you like to mention what you disagree with? Do you think a group of people should have the right to decide which transactions are legitimate and which ones aren't?
@_date: 2017-01-30 21:06:24
If miners started taking responsibility blockstream will quickly be out of business.  I think BS has liked the miner's apathy to the whole situation...
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:18:18
you must be sending higher fees.  Fees are about 4x higher than they used to be
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:58:26
Wow that's interesting thanks for the information! Good point on clicking on it :)
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:01:06
They don't have the ability to block transactions they think are illegitimate.  But for some reason when there is a transaction backlog and Blockstream says not to worry about it because the transactions are spam, people take their word for it because Blockstream said so.
Blockstream/Core has no right to decide which transactions are spam.  If a transaction is valid it is valid and that is all that matters.  Blockstream shouldn't step in and designate some transactions as spam when they don't like those transactions.  Which is what Blockstream has been doing.
@_date: 2017-01-26 00:59:30
How is what I said a conspiracy? Is it not true that blockstream wants segwit??  I'm agreeing with what the two people said above me, that in order to get anything passed we must do both.  If both sides argue from an either/or perspective then nothing will ever reach consensus.  Yes I know segwit allows for 2mb blocks.  With a 2mb blocksize increase as well we would have 4mb blocks, like I said.  Did you read what I wrote?
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:52:00
I also think segwit and LN are great and want a max blocksize increase as well.  I think a lot of big blockers' problem is that they don't trust blockstream to increase the blocksize later on and that's why segwit with a blocksize increase should be done at the same time.  You can see my post about a compromise here: np.reddit.com@_date: 2017-01-25 15:46:34
Not necessarily.  If there are bigger blocks and more transactions they may make more money from that than less transactions with greater fees.  Depends on how many more transactions there will be
@_date: 2017-01-30 22:54:16
Well thanks for contributing nothing to the conversation
@_date: 2017-01-30 23:43:21
Okay, my argument is that I don't want a group of developers deciding for the community what transactions are legitimate or not.  That's not the point of bitcoin.  Anyone should be able to move money without feeling the need to justify their action to Blockstream.  There is no such thing as transaction spam.  If it is a valid transaction it is a valid transaction.  Blockstream uses "transaction spam" as a way to spread disinformation that there is no transaction backlog.  Because according to blockstream, there wouldn't be any backlog if there wasn't "spam".  This is a ridiculous argument.  Blockstream doesn't get to decide which transactions count as spam.  They are all valid.  There is a transaction backlog
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:11:32
I agree with that.  But Blockstream has been saying that currently there is no transaction backlog because it is spam.  They don't have that right to decide that.  There is a backlog of legitimate transactions.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:04:41
You can do a blocksize increase along with segwit.  A 2mb blocksize increase with segwit would give you 4mb blocks (since segwit allows for 2mb blocks without increase the max blocksize constant)
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:53:30
Good explanation for people to read
@_date: 2017-01-31 20:26:18
That is roughly 48% that support segwit, 26.7% Core not flagging for segwit, and 5.5% unlimited.  Still not a lot of support for segwit
@_date: 2017-01-30 22:56:44
I think big blocks are important but the point of my post was to say I don't think that a group of developers should be given the power to decide which transactions are legitimate or not.  If a transaction is not a double spend then it isn't spam.
Saying there is no transaction backlog because it's all spam doesn't make sense.  If the transactions are valid then they are valid.  No one should want Core telling people that their transaction doesn't belong on the blockchain.  That's a form of centralization
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:59:47
Segwit allows for more like 2mb currently, if it were to pass.  I definitely have a handle on that information.  I'll quote it for you from my post above! I wrote: "Yes I know segwit allows for 2mb blocks.  With a 2mb blocksize increase as well we would have 4mb blocks".  I've said that multiple times.  Please explain to me how that is a conspiracy theory?? You've asked me multiple times if I know segwit allows for 2mb blocks and I keep on saying yes yet you keep on asking me.  I don't think you're reading my posts.  Glad you aren't the mod here or these facts would probably have been deleted.
About me saying blockstream refuses to compromise, I think that is accurate.  I think most big blockers would be willing to compromise and do segwit with a 2mb max blocksize increase.  Blockstream only wants segwit, they do not want to compromise and do both.  Like I've said so many times in this thread (and I'm really getting tired of repeating myself for you, please just read my initial post), I think the only way something will get passed is if there is a compromise.  Segwit alone, or bigger blocks alone, will never reach enough consensus.  I think if there is segwit with a 2mb max blocksize increase then there will be consensus on that.
In case you're going to ask me for a fourth time if I know segwit allows for 2mb blocks: yes I do know that thank you.  Segwit with a 2mb max blocksize increase would allow for about 4mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:57:35
That has literally NEVER happened.  But you believe it all of a sudden will start doing so just because u/nullc says so and he says bitcoin is broken and he's the only one to save it? What is the evidence that this will start to happen? IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:46:33
I disagree with the best way to scale Bitcoin but that's not what this conversation was about.
You said that for a current block size no one should be deciding which transactions count as legitimate or spam.  My point is that is exactly what Blockstream has been doing.  When they say there is no transaction backlog because it's just spam, that is wrong.  They don't have the right to decide which transactions are illegitimate.
You seemed to agree with me in your post above.  You said for a new blocksize it's important to consider what transactions should be accounted for and how many need to fit in the block.  But for the current blocksize, that shouldn't be a discussion.  Well that is what blockstream is doing when they argue there is no transaction backlog
@_date: 2017-01-31 21:12:34
Seeing as 95% is needed for activation, no 48% is not a lot.  Neither is 5.5%.  But like u/CosmosKing98 said both segwit and BU have each around 22% hashing power
@_date: 2016-11-10 04:04:18
They aren't false and he was talking about a bigger block size, not seg wit.  Bigger blocks could have been done a year ago rather than waiting around for segwit (which won't work as well nor as quickly) and bitcoins growth wouldn't have been stunted for a year+.
My main point is that the argument that a bigger block size is dangerous to bitcoin doesn't make sense since your dev said himself that it would be safe to have a bigger block size.  Until blockstream paid him...
@_date: 2016-11-08 23:06:33
again, nullc himself has said bigger blocks would be fine.  I posted the links here in previous comments you can find them there
@_date: 2016-11-04 00:05:51
everyone needs to run segwit and only use multisig and then maybe we could get close to around 4mb equivalency.  Or we could have just increased the blocksize years ago.  But we need LN or blockstream can't make money
@_date: 2016-11-02 23:17:23
why are you ignoring the links where you said yourself that bigger blocks were safe?
Edit: And if people could have discussions without censorship by the people with massive conflicts of interest, maybe a compromise could be reached by everyone and a split in the network wouldn't be an issue
@_date: 2017-01-30 16:03:19
I don't agree we need a fee market but I do agree with you that having alot of nodes is vital.  You said it yourself: "segwit tx will be inherently cheaper, but the increased tx volume will more than compensate."
Fees might have been zero when blocks were 100kb but from 100kb-a little under 1mb before there was backlog there was free space and fees weren't zero.  For most of bitcoin's life, there has been space in blocks and still fees (but very small ones).  If there are enough transactions on chain then those small fees will be enough to compensate miners when there is no more block reward
@_date: 2016-11-02 23:20:56
Making sure bitcoin doesn't have problems is definitely important.  But SW capacity increases won't be seen until 100% of the nodes are running segwit and even then it just brings us to about the equivalent of 1.7MB blocksize.  Truth is we need way more than that and core's stalling so that we are forced to use their paid product won't solve bitcoin's problems.  A 2 or 4MB blocksize would help us immediately and was something we could have done a year or so ago
@_date: 2016-11-15 21:59:18
Except if everyone paid the recommended fee it still wouldn't solve the problem because the blocks would still be full... The recommended fee would just rise higher and higher until people no longer want to use bitcoin and then people's transactions go through.  Raising fees doesn't allow more transactions...
@_date: 2016-11-02 23:24:25
I'm not sure I agree with you that there's no difference in a hard or soft fork of segwit.  People that need to censor other people's opinions claims there is no difference, people that don't need to censor dissenting opinions claim there is and it would be better for bitcoin to have segwit as a hard fork.  I generally agree with people that don't resort to sneaky tactics...
@_date: 2016-11-04 00:04:02
Yeah censorship is such a "card" to play.  Because deleting other people's opinions doesn't show a weakness at all.
Here's one example: 
Mods claimed it was because of brigading (or that, you know, too many people were saying something they didn't like)
Or here as well: 
Again, u/nullc himself has said bigger blocks wouldn't be an issue

Hey thanks for your reply!
Doesn't segwit basically allow 2MB worth of transactions in a 1MB block? But that it's not an actual increase of the blocksize to 2MB?  I thought that's why the Hong Kong Agreement with miners and developers agreed on Segwit with a 2MB increase in size, not just capacity.  Is my understanding wrong? Thanks
@_date: 2016-10-31 23:45:03
It's not the same as a hard fork 2MB blocksize or a hard fork segwit which would remove a lot of unnecessary code.  But you are so against hard forks because it may open up the possibility of blocksize increases but that's really a separate story.
And the reason I posted "all over reddit" (really just once more in r/btc) was because you stopped replying to me and apparently it worked because now we are talking again.
And in both those places you seem to think a blocksize increase is fine, until you're paid and have a financial interest in off chain scaling.  And then you are adamantly against anything more than 1mb
Edit: Sorry I missed your sneaky last minute edit.  Segwit wouldn't reach 2MB and everyone would have to be running segwit nodes for it to even reach a noticeable increase in transactions which probably won't happen since you are doing it as a soft fork and people won't need to upgrade.  Either way, it's not the same as a 2MB block size increase
@_date: 2016-10-31 03:16:22
Why did Core devs agree to the Hong Kong Agreement with the miners then? It was supposed to be segwit along with a 2MB blocksize increase.  u/nullc could you comment on this?
I thought the reason core devs agreed to a 2MB blocksize increase was because they didn't think it would have a big impact on nodes
@_date: 2016-10-29 22:12:30
Wouldn't 2MB block size along with seg wit be better for everyone?
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:54:27
He can’t. He’s talking out his ass. The money is gone. He considers giving people the dollar value as of 4 years ago as making people whole. It’s bullshit
@_date: 2016-10-31 23:25:00
But saying that Segwit is a 2MB blocksize is false and misleading.
And why are you so against a blocksize increase now, when before Blockstream you've mentioned that a 2MB - 10MB blocksize would be safe?
@_date: 2016-10-31 23:09:46
I didn't know that there was only a 5 lines of code difference, thanks!
But to answer your previous question about 2MB blocksize being safe, that is something u/nullc himself has said before (you can read more here:  and here:  and there was a Cornell study saying 4MB would be safe as well.
@_date: 2016-10-29 22:14:05
Doesn't segwit allow 2MB worth of transactions in a 1MB block? But that it's not an actual increase of the blocksize to 2MB? Why doesn't everyone want both? 2MB blocksize wouldn't have much of an impact on number of nodes.
Isn't that what the Hong Kong Agreement was anyway? Miners and developers agreed on Segwit with a 2MB increase in blocksize? Is my understanding wrong? Thanks
@_date: 2016-10-31 03:36:31
Thanks I'll try to find his posts about the agreement.  What's the reasoning behind not doing segwit as a hard fork so there's less code that could have bugs?
