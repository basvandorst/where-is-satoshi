at this point, i would pick up an antminer and just play with it, and support the network.  TBH, take what you would spend on hardware, and the calculated cost of electricity and buy some btc when it hits a trough.  If I bought btc back when I started mining, instead of buying hardware, I would be sitting on 7 figures of financial security.  But I am just a lowly grunt now.
@_date: 2014-01-11 16:40:43
you don't just buy once and sit. you watch, sell when it gets a little higher, and buy again when it gets a little lower.  you'd be o fool to do otherwise.

I got a preorder in for the first batch of jalapenos. (was in the 1000's for the first one), a preorder in for the upgraded jalapeno, and one for one of their 60gh miners. none of them came close to pulling a profit (well the first jalapeno did in USD, but I spent enough btc to cover expenses for me for a year now, and likewise for the 60 gh miner). At this point, I could have paid off a big chunk of a new house with what I spent on those three little devices. Hindsight is always 20/20 though.

I got in early, bought into the BFL hype and lost over half of my coinage to them. Over time I have cashed out many times over what I invested in initial hardware, and now I'm just holding for the kids (and maybe some retirement fundage). I have some stake in btc, but I'd also be alright if it disappeared tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 23:11:38
nice. I tried to jump on the BFL ship and got sunk (1 jalapeno for me, 1 for a friend, and a 60gh miner, all too late to be useful). If I had kept the coins I mined, I would be sitting pretty right about now. Or if I would have bought coins instead of my initial hardware, I would have made an even bigger killing, though i mined on a 5830 that OC'd and mined like a tank in its own day ($30, broken fan on ebay).
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:43:17
i've been out of the game for a while, doing a little trading here and there (like $1 a day or something, just messing around), and mining with my antminer on a pi. bitcoin is my play money, if it goes up, horray, if not, i've already made great use of it for paying bills and other things for a couple months to support living while building a start-up. from here out, it's all profit and fun for me.
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:41:58
Nothing wrong with that man. I'm in the same boat (sort of). I sold off some btc when I needed money to pay for life, and have made a few times what I put in. Now I am just sitting back and enjoying the rollercoaster and trading a little on the side.

you can buy amazon gift cards with btc, then buy things on amazon with the gift cards. I've used Gyft in the past for this. They used to offer like 3-5% back (value on their site) if you used btc. It has been a while since I did that though.

I just took a friend through the process today. It's still a bit prohibitive for the layman, but not terrible. definitely not as easy as when i bought a busted ATI 5830 off ebay, threw an old fan on it, downloaded cgminer and got to it.

I've been working with this guy for about a year now, and recently built in a bitcoin payment system for all those artists looking to market their pieces and pay using btc. We don't actually sell the art, just give you a platform to market it. I'm building more tools/improving the site on a weekly basis, so if you know any artists that would like to share their art with the world, send them our way! If you sign up using bitcoin, we have knocked off about 1/6 of the price (~2 month value for the subscription).
Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

they'll sell it on late night tv like they do silver coins today!

I'm glad to hear it gave you financial freedom. I got in early and over my time mining I did pretty well. I lost most of it to some cheap gambling sites in the early years, some BFL hardware purchases, and some scams, but it also helped me move across the country and pay the bills while I was looking for work. At this point I got out way more than I put into it, and I have some for a rainy day and my kids' education. Take a break, breath easy, then jump back on for another fun ride!
@_date: 2015-08-28 19:56:27
Kind of. We let artists, galleries, and collectors post art they have created or own that is for sale. They can use the site to share their art on social platforms and such, and hopefully build their brand and fan base. No transactions for art sale is done through the site, so no fees for art sold unlike many other similar websites. The artist and buyer settle the bill outside of the site (not limiting the way those transactions can occur).
@_date: 2015-08-30 00:22:36
We have it set up as an annual payment for bitcoin, so you make one payment a year, opposed to the traditional monthly subscription model. It is kind of a pain, but also has a reasonable discount for the annual charge. It is set up to notify users when their subscription is about to expire so they can start a new subscription before it runs out.

with free electricity and some extremely cheap 2nd hand hardware, maybe. but in reality it has always been more "profitable" to buy after being mined. At any point if you could drop the $$$ to mine, you could invest in btc at that amount and make out way better.

It was close enough to get your point. I'm just a nit-picky bastard sometimes. Many states already have some sort of legislation in place concerning cryptocurrencies, and they are not nearly as lax as this one. It would be awesome to see more laissez faire government involvement.

I'm not sure. I didn't read the actual bill yet, just received this article in an email, and saw it wasn't posted, so I shared it. It says NV won't impose a tax/fee on the use of blockchain tech. I'm not sure if capital gains falls into the term "use" there or not.

@_date: 2017-06-16 19:04:57
same general idea, but vastly different governmental involvement. Marijuana is pretty well regulated by some entity like the LCB (Liquor and Cannabis Board), and it is taxed. This article said that blockchain use won't be taxed by the government.

Make sure to check your sources, make sure they are active, and appear legit.
Also, keep an eye out for prices, as many of them appear to be wicked high right now due to the increase over the past month.
It would be cool to see something like a mix of bitmit (auctions) and btcjam (user verification) that has some admins who care about the users.  Both admins have been silent about people ripping off other users and hurting the community

It took her about 6-7 months, but we also had the last big halving happen during that time and hardness has been jumping a lot lately.  She was making close to .025 when she started, now he is averaging around .015 a day give or take a little.

My thoughts exactly.  I have a 5830 that's pulling 320 mhash.  Snagged it on ebay for $60.  
@_date: 2013-03-26 05:37:30
once it's lost, it's lost, unless you remember where you buried your treasure.  ;)  Imagine if the network had some sort of timer on the wallets, and you didn't use your wallet for that amount of time, you would lose your btc.
The whole point of bitcoin is to give people power over their trading medium, and with power comes responsibility.
And in a technical perspective, the coins are never lost to the network.  The network keeps track of all wallets.  The intended owner just wouldn't be able to access theirs.
@_date: 2013-06-03 04:44:56
cool, thanks for the info!
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:33:05
You are probably pulling 44.8 mhash (mhps), not ghps.  You are using a mobile nvidia graphics chip according to the image you shared.  Mining with a mac is pretty weak right now, you should try getting a computer with at least some ATI/AMD Radeon HD graphics cards and pull a little bit there.  It will be a while before you get something with 44 mhash, and it may not even be worth it with the power consumption of your system.  USD$0.40 a day is pretty small.  
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:53:28
I would hate to have my value in gold leaf.
In the respect that litecoin is a similar medium for trading value as bitcoin, the gold and silver analogy works.  But you could also compare it to gold and ruby and many other precious metals and gems.
Yes you could get all of your gold accurately measured out into little leaf squares and have a good value.  But is it practical?  Not in my opinion.  That's where the analogy differs.
What would you define as a manageable "size" for a trading material?  With bitcoin, and crypto as a whole, that manageable size is something so small that it doesn't need a secondary material to measure the smaller values.  I'm not saying that litecoin is good or bad.  I mine it.
I think that the gold and silver analogy doesn't quite fit with the way I see it.  If you would like to explain it to me in the way you see it, that would be cool.  It might straighten out my misunderstanding or something.
@_date: 2013-03-26 06:13:14
have you ordered them yet or not? which ones are you looking at?  I have 2 Jalapenos pre-ordered.  I bought them with bitcoins I mined, so it's not a big loss if they don't return much fast.  But once more ASICs are in the wild, it will make it much less profitable to mine with GPUs as well.
If you have already ordered some, and regret your decision, you can probably sell it for 200-300%+ mark-up on ebay right now.
As the value of btc rises, so will your ROI on the miners (maybe not in btc, but in fiat currency).
You can take a look at my situation for an example.  I have bought 5 graphics cards over the past year, with the bitcoins hitting the first big halving, and the hardness getting pretty crazy.  But I am pulling a larger profit in USD now than I was when I started.  My cards are all paid off 5 times over, and I can still sell them for actual cash at this point as well, which will net me probably really close to what I paid for them (maybe more in some cases).
Now you can look at it the same way with the ASICs.  They will probably have quick earnings early, then it will level off.  If you run it for 6 months-a year+, you will make back what you paid in and at least a little more.  Most of them will pay for themselves in about a week-10 days, currently.  If you're in it for the long haul, you'd be shooting yourself in the foot if you didn't invest in an ASIC.

@_date: 2013-05-27 16:05:30
The hardness is always changing as many have said before.  but at the same time, once you get the hardware, it's yours, and you can mine with it forever.  a lot of people are saying not to get it because you won't get a good ROI.  I picked up a set of gfx cards around the beginning of the year (when everyone was saying mining was going down the drains) for $180.  They have netted me 6 btc since then.  That's after the 50-25btc/block drop and the hardness doubling and then some.  You won't get a major amount of btc off the bat, but sit on it, and let your miner do it's thing, and in a few months you'll have something considerable.  
Now with the ASICs actually being released, you are going to be in a long line.  I'm waiting for one ordered on Jul 21, 2013.  So the wait will be quite a while for orders placed now.  I had a friend quoted at ~Oct/Nov for an order placed in March.
If you can stomach the wait and the slow returns, go for it.  But if you're looking to get rich quick, don't even bother.  
@_date: 2013-05-22 01:07:04
being a member on bitmit and btcjam, I have found many scams and fell for a few (i'm down about 10 btc... d'oh!)  the challenge here would be building a system that somehow deters these fraudulent activities.  at this point, there seems to be a lot of it happening due to the inability to recover bitcoins from a bad deal.
@_date: 2013-06-27 05:22:44
we need raw material producers that will accept bitcoin.  once producers in this position start accepting bitcoin, then it can travel down the supply chain to final product.  find some farmers, miners, smelters, and textilers and get them on-board and it can happen.

@_date: 2013-04-27 21:41:55
I did some reading into this a few months ago, and most of the chips are pretty expensive.  You will spend $100+ easily to get maybe 100 mhash.  Their power consumption is much lower than GPU's, but you will need a few to match the hashing power of a reasonably good GPU (a 5830 or 5850 for example at around 300 mhash).  
an FPGA would be a good place to learn how to make your own miner, but they will either drop drastically in price when the asics finally ship, or nobody will buy them.

bitmit needs a revamp and has issues with scammers, so users are wary of purchases
@_date: 2013-10-07 00:07:45
i think a lot of it depends on your purchase currency.  if you bought with btc during pre-order, you'd be extremely lucky to get a positive ROI.  If you paid USD, you're raking in good money.  I've made about 7 btc from my jalapeno, i wish i preordered with USD, because I would have made like 500% ROI, but i bought with btc... i'll never see a positive ROI.

@_date: 2013-06-02 22:08:07
i know, i have heard of the testnet.  it's my understanding it is just a fork of the blockchain to test mining stuff on, right?  so theoretically it should have a similar hardness... well i guess a considerably lower one, due to people not working off of that chain.  either way with that hash rate, i would expect it to have a pretty low probability of discovering a block, right?
@_date: 2013-04-27 21:51:43
If you're not paying for electricity, go for it.  Even a little bit will add up after a while.  My girlfriend has a 6850 mining around 200 mhash and she's made 2 btc so far.  It's not much, but it's something.

if you can snag some reasonable gpu's for cheap, you can get a little coin.  i got a 5770 for a cheap bottle of rum (~USD$35), it paid itself off in a month, and makes about USD$1 a day.  it's not power hungry so most of that is profit.  Dig around and do a little research, and wait for the right deals.

@_date: 2013-05-01 17:01:15
you can do pretty well with a 5850 right now, and that's only a $160 card... 
As noted above, you will need a Radeon HD card.  If you have something in the 58xx+, 68xx+, or 77xx+ ranges, you can do alright or pretty good.  With the power cost, you could just think of it as a slow exchange from USD/whatever your local currency is, to BTC (you pay for electricity that in return gives you bitcoins).  Everyone is so against getting into gpu mining right now, but I still pull 2 btc a month with my rigs at about 1200 mhash (4 cards).  Though I don't pay for electricity, so that's kinda nice.
It is a slow return, but it's not terrible.  Until ASICs run the market, GPUs are still a good start, and can still be marginally profitable.  
With varying electricity prices and such, ymmv with mining though.  Do some research into power consumption of your rig with it's hashing ability.

hopefully btc will be widely accepted, and everyone will have an active wallet that will solve blocks (maybe a jalapeno-style miner that is low powered).  Otherwise, a Govt may pick up the block generation &amp; solving and control btc that way.
@_date: 2013-04-30 04:40:46
This is true, but I look at it this way... GPU's will soon be worth nothing for mining, I've already made back what I paid for my hardware.  Many times over, in fact.  So I cashed out what I put into the system, and I invested a little into some new hardware (landed a 50 gig miner from bfl the night before the big crash), and I'll help the network grow, probably make back my investment, and not have to trip the breaker in my apartment every few days.
@_date: 2013-05-30 04:49:54
at the point that i placed the bid, i had no idea what escrow was, so yeah, my ignorance trumped the day.  btc were like $10 a pop, and i was mining about 0.3-0.4 a day, so it wasn't a big thing.   that user ended up getting 3 or 4 other people (they messaged me seeing that i "bought" a card from him as well). i have also had some good experiences on bitmit with a few other purchases though.  i think the site could use some refining.
i find it kind of interesting that a few buyer/seller services haven't risen to the top with all of the tech geeks supporting bitcoin.  i mean sure there are a bunch of mom and pop shops set up, but nothing is like the de facto bitcoin auction site, or craigslist equivalent.

very true.  those people can suck a nut though.  the btc market is young and extremely volatile because some investors thought they could make a quick buck on it.  i'm glad they cashed out at a loss.  that's what you get for playing a market, and adding to the panic of a burst. for the real btcers out there, i applaud you!  hold onto your coins, take them back from the investors, and put them to USE!  the strength in this currency will be in it's world-wide adoption and use.

ugly?  going back 2 months, 1 bitcoin was worth a fraction of what it is now.  I'm holding loosely and riding it out like a sweet wave! ::woooosh::

There are a handful of other crypto currencies out there.  Litecoin, Namecoin are the other two larger ones currently.  I don't think they will be a silver to bictoin's gold, because btc can be broken down to ridiculously small amounts, becoming it's own gold.
These other currencies suit to what I would call niche trading/value markets.  Namecoin, for example, is like a distributed dns system, and you get nmc for "mining" transactions of dns records.
I think these crypto currencies will fair better than e-gold did.  But it all depends on the adoption of them.  If there are easy ways to convert between currencies, they all have a good chance of taking off.

i tried selling btc on paypal once.  the guy said he didn't have the money and never paid.  then i realized that many of the accounts that bid on btc were fraud users, and doing chargebacks or hacking accounts.  i've dabbled in different things with btc and lost about USD$1,000 but i've made much more than that as well.  it sucks but ya live and ya learn.
