Sell them?? Absolutely not! You made no mistake here, if anyone in the comments are telling you to sell, they're not giving you good advice. A 3 month snapshot of an investment is no indication of what it will look like 18 months from now. Don't become one of those guys who sold all their bitcoin when it went back down to $200. The best way to make a profit in to trade on principle not emotion. Right now the emotion tied to the money is telling you to run but have your opinions of the coins you invested in changed? If you truly believe the coin you invested in in a great coin with a great future ahead of it, keep it. The entire market is down right now because of the bitcoin spike once things settle down people will reinvest into altcoins. Smart money is scooping up as many alts as they can right now, there will be a rally, you'll either be watching it or be riding it.
A bit of a ramble but I think you get the idea =)

Don't you hate it when they do that?

Won't happen

The finish line will continue to move. Had you asked this question a few years ago, everyone would have been happy with $2000 BTC

Vertcoin: GPU mined only, ASIC resistant, SegWit, Lightning Network, and we are on track to have atomic swap with Litecoin soon
We're a little over 30m though
