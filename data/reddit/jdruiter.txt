You remember introduction of the euro in 2002? You remember prices essentially doubling in supermarkets within a year in central/east europe?

The economy GDP has grown enormously over the last 100 years. Purchasing power not increasing is bad in itself.


It is the worst investment strategy precisely because of continuous inflating (money printing) the US dollar supply. In a more ideal scenario your savings value stays the same or is increasing (Bitcoin).

It comes down to personal preference. Bittrex and Polo have both lots of coin. Their websites work okay. They both don't have USD or EUR but USDT.  And they both have no support AT ALL if things go wrong. 
Only put money on exchanges that you can lose. Bitfinex included.

It's impossible to predict a market a week from now, monkeys proved just as good as experts in that. But noticing a trend over the years is another game. Much more predictable.

There's a full article on that:

That .. or they heard about Mt. Gox and some bitcoin scams and decided the whole Bitcoin business is too dangerous for their customers. I'd disagree but that can be their position

I think you simply mean you sold your BCC coins..

Any special trick you have to do while sending? 
After I send BTC to Viabtc they only show up as BTC, no free BCC.

Stocks is a good second. Investing in 2009 in Nasdaq would have gotten you at least 2x return on investment with relatively low risk.

Windows XP is no longer supported. Any security holes will remain unpatched. Its not secure.

For one Bitcoin you get BT1 and BT2. They remain locked until 16 november. 
After the fork BT1 becomes BTC (if the chain still exists and is viable) and BT2 becomes B2X (segwit2x chain) if the chain exists and is viable.  
BT1 is currently worth $5600. BT2 is currently worth $1070. So that's exactly the current price of Bitcoin.

And what's the alternative? 
Running a full node with 10GB per day once Bitcoin cash really starts being used for paying for coffee and electronics as its used to? 
You can't duplicate an entire transaction network history over all users AND have trillions of small (spam) transactions.

That note is from 30 july. If anyone shorted they had a painful time when Bitcoin went from 5000 to 7000 haha

Kucoin apparently is based in China. 
China is banning vpn's.

I see the Antpool blocks are not signalling Segwit commitment on xbt.eu. Antpool has 22% of the total hashing power. Problem
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:14:56
Thanks. Coin.dance is now reporting Antpool support too

Chinese are buying BTCC on ViaBTC now for around 400 dollar per piece.. no idea why.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:32:07
ViaBTC works great for me so far. The split to BCC and BTC, and the selling of BCC.

I like that as a quote.

Afaik it has replay protection

You need to split your coins. Send your BTC to a different address and send BTCC to another address (on exchange). Google a tutorial on splitting.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:35:29
Yes. You don't even have to tranfer it back and forth. Every BTC you have on the exchange you can split BTC into BCC + BTCfrozen, and then sell the BCC to buy more BTC. But this fractional BTC buying has diminishing returns.

The Bitcoin unlimited movement has about 45% mining capacity. If they get behind this Bitcoin cash, the BCC Coin will end up worth at least something.
