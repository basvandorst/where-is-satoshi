How do you figure?

I did for awhile but recently it seems like a couple times a day there will be a period of 30-60min with no confirmations.

There are literally hundreds of people who do this, but most of it is just click-bait type stuff (or pay-for-positive-reviews).
The best thing to do is the vet any perspective book on a site like BCT (where most of them have their own thread).  See how active they are, what their deposit/withdraw times are like, ect.
Personally, right now, the two best are nitrogen and anonibet.

Today they had a special .5 coin freeroll that you had to qualify for all week by playing in smaller freerolls that payed out in tickets for the large freeroll.  I'm guessing you tried to join that and couldn't.  They have daily freerolls that are open to everyone and then you can also use your balance to enter real games.

It's not technically sports betting, it's fantasy sports.  
Here's a short primer: you have a salary to spend to field a team.  Every player has a set price.  You have to select players to make a complete team under the salary cap (in basketball you have to select a certain number of PGs, SGs, SF, C, ect...in baseball you have to select one catcher, one 1st baseman, one 2nd baseman, ect).  You then compete against other people's teams with standard fantasy scoring.  
H2H games are played one on one, best score wins.  Double up games are played against an even number of people (usually 6 or 10 total people) and half of the teams win.  GPPs are tournaments where you compete against a large number of people, and the top 10% (usually) will win, with the prizes being top heavy.

Never going to happen.  Ebay owns paypal.  After they take the auction fees they make another 3+% when you send the money.  If they offer a payment option that they don't control, they stand to lose ~20% of their yearly revenue.  No business will ever do that.

They stiffed a customer for 340k, he posted a very long, very detailed write up on BCT, and then a bunch of other people started coming forward about how much they were stiffed.
So...pretty bad shit.

I know, I read the title.  You're prob running good, eventually you'll catch that hour long wait time and get annoyed, but overall I agree it works very well.

I just had a transaction that took 80 minutes to confirm.

Damn, that sounds like a sticky situation.

I've already claimed a BCT free credit, so I'll skip the offer, but I will say that this site is good if you enjoy DFS.  It's a little no-frills, but it works which is the important thing, and the owner seems to be interested in taking suggestions and making it better.  Payouts and withdraws have always been quick and accurate.
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:12:33
It's free, he's given a coin away on BCT and a coin on here (and has run freerolls for the past week+ giving away over a coin).  All of the contest information is on the site, there are mostly one on one games and a nightly larger GPP.  These giveaways have a 1x rollover, so as long as you basically play one game, you are free to withdraw everything in your account.
@_date: 2014-03-09 08:24:36
...because I have no clue that that site exists, unlike overstock which is a giant company.

Do you process cashouts in bitcoin?  Do you allow players to deposit using paypal/cc and then cashout winnings (after the initial deposit amount has been refunded) in bitcoin?
I'm a big DFS fan and a bitcoin supporter, but the last bitcoin dfs site has me a little on edge.

To offer higher margins.  The algorithm makes it so that the most you can win on any one bet is 1/200th the current bankroll.
@_date: 2014-09-03 19:03:26
Good to know.  I'm familiar with the 'refund' cashout policy, many existing DFS sites use it, I'm assuming for the reason you listed.  
I have a few more questions/comments for you, if there's a better place to ask let me know:
- Are you planning on rolling out any other sports at some point?  What/when?
- How long do you expect cashouts to take?  I've noticed that bitcoin poker/dfs sites usually process within 8-12 hours, but fiat dfs sites typically take 2-3 days.  
- You have facebook and twitter buttons on your site, but clicking on them does nothing.  Searching twitter for  turns up some random person.  Do you not have a social media presence?  If no, why are the buttons there?
- The terms don't seem to say anything about employees not using the site.  Does the site employ any house players/shills/sponsored players?  If yes, are these players marked as such?
- I noticed that the two paid GPPs this week are guaranteed to overlay by at least 1.5k and 1k respectively.  Assuming this is intentional (it's not mentioned anywhere and I'd imagine you'd use this as a selling point), is this a welcome week only type thing, or do you foresee having guaranteed-overlay tournaments as a regular occurrence?  If the GPPs don't fill (which, as a brand new site, I'm assuming you aren't expecting them to), are you planning on lowering the number of entries in the coming weeks?  Are you planning on adding additional GPPs in the coming weeks?
Honestly, it looks like a lot of the other sites when they started up, which I like (smaller GPPs and more overlay = value).  I'll probably throw a few entries into the two tournaments this week and see what's what.  Thanks for taking the time and answering my questions.

I actually didn't (since I wanted to pay with bitcoins, I only checked overstock and tiger direct), but I just did and the exact same computer is selling on amazon for almost $200 more.  
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:45:13
It was fine for what I needed, which was mainly something to play my backlog of steam games on.  I don't really know how competitive their prices are on some of the higher end stuff.

Feel free to x-post this on if you'd like.
But, the only realistic situation is that you are lying or someone working for Nitro is lying.  It would be very very difficult for someone to 'hack' your:
Nitro name
Nitro pw
Do you leave your computer unsecured?  Is it possible someone in your life accessed your account while you were asleep and transferred your funds out?
Also, it's bitcoin poker man!  It costs pennies to transfer your funds.  Transfer them out when you finish a session and transfer them back in when you start a session.  Never ever ever trust anyone with your money when you don't have to.

Do you know how stressful it is to keep a NM Underground River playset in your house?  Think of the humidity.

I had this exact same problem today...a bunch of transactions sent out, sitting there pending.  When I checked them in the blockchain they were there but no estimations on time to confirm (usually it's "high priority").  Finally, I closed electrum and opened it again and they all instantly confirmed.  Odd.

Bitcoin has to fall nearly 90% for 1mbtc to equal $1.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:50:25


It is, but 1mbtc is on thousandth of a bitcoin, not one millionth.  Mill/mille as a prefix for currency means 1/1000th.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:52:11


You could put them on an exchange (or multiple exchanges) and set a stop-loss.  That way if the price goes up, you still have your coins and they are worth more, but if the price goes down you'll have sold at an acceptable level and don't lose all of your value.

It sounds like you just need a wallet of your own.  For starters, try opening a wallet on blockchain.  You will have a QR code (which you can give to people and they can scan) and a wallet address (which you can copy/paste and give to people).  People send bitcoins to your address and POOF! you have bitcoins.  You should usually wait for one or two confirmations on the blockchain (for safety to make sure that you were actually sent and actually own the bitcoins you received) and you can then send out the goods that you sold.  The blockchain wallet will do the btc---USD conversion, or you can just google to find an easy conversion to know how much to ask people to send (assuming you are selling in USD).
Then you just need to open a coinbase or circle account and when you want to 'cash out' your bitcoins, you just send them to your coinbase/circle account and click "sell" and you'll have the money in your bank account the next day.  You should probably set those accounts up now since they typically take a few days to get everything set up.
It sounds slightly complicated but in practice it's very simple and very quick (and virtually free).

I got that error code a couple of weeks ago when I hadn't updated to the most current version.  I upgraded to 2.5.2 which is what I'm currently using with no issues.  Just to double check, I tried to send a transaction and it went through no problem.  Maybe try using 2.5.2?
@_date: 2015-11-14 22:51:00
Right, I'm saying that maybe there's an issue with that release?  Maybe you should try installing 2.5.2 which I know for a fact works.  That way you can see if it's something on your computer's end or on their end.

...ok.  To most people, 20 hours away doesn't count as 'close'.  I suppose it's all relative, though.

20 hours = close?
