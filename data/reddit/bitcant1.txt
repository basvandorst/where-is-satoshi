I just looked up a screenshot of the mt gox website for shits and giggles, and I have a feeling I may have used that. If that's the case, I'm suppose I'm an unlucky dude?

Created a blockchain account, went to recover wallet, entered my passphrase, it spit out the password that I had emailed myself, but I don't see a login link..

Thanks. But to clarify, if I never originally created an account with blockchain, none of this will help me correct? 
As a side note, if I purchased my coins through mt gox, I'm screwed anyhow, right?

As a side note, does anyone know how to get back to that welcome screen through electrum?

When I type in my old mnemonic phrase, it does spit out a password, which matches the one I emailed myself.

How? If I have my mnemonic, and my password (and blockchain spit out the correct password when I tired to recover wallet), what's the next step?

I may have misunderstood the purpose of blockchain. I just created a new account, and when it spit out the password, I'm not sure what to do next. I don't have an identifier to log in with (it would have been the identifier from when I supposedly created the account?) Please help clear up my confusion...?

Doesn't seem to give me a link. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:30:05
Fair enough. I appreciate your help earlier.

When I click File &gt; New/Restore, it brings me to the finder and asks me to enter a new file name.

I would like to retry the key in Electrum, but I think I created a new one in electrum (with the same phrase) by mistake, and it accepted it. Maybe I mistyped that time. The point is, I'd like to go back to the welcome screen and enter a new seed, but can't figure out how to get back there...

They are all on that list.

I guess I forgot to mention that the email account I believe I used to purchase the coins was deleted by google due to inactivity. My SMS phone # didn't work either. Sooo I guess that means I'm likely screwed?

Alright, I'll try this. Thanks.
