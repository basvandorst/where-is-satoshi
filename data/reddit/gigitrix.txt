They believe "the fundamentals" give you price X. But then the stuff that's not designated a "fundamental" is the stuff anchoring it to the real price. So really it's a tautology, because the market is based on all factors, not just those cherry picked by an analyst as important.

People support Patreons because they support individual creators though. It's an emotional relationship where the user feels some attachment to the work of the creator, and wishes to specifically support it. And they, on some level, want the feeling of "giving" so that they can feel good about it.
This is really really different to the numbers based arguments around micropayment systems - in these users are expected to feel the need to support whole groups of sites based on just their usage, and just as they lack that emotional connection to the recipient they also lack the "feel good" response they'd get by giving.
It's not a criticism of Brave specifically (cool people like [ work on it) but to me it feels like a technology and usability attempt at a solution that isn't viable just because of how humans are wired emotionally.

I agree that it *can* be configured to work like this. But I think it's a tough sell to get people using it and finding their accounts because of this perception. There's not the direct link between watching a creator make their case for support and pushing a big green button that makes them feel good about their choice. And of course brave can add big green happy buttons, but only once people are already in their software ecosystem.
It's definitely one to watch and I support the idea but I'm pessimistic about it gaining any kind of market share.

You identify problems with Bitcoin as a model that have no solution. Bitcoin is only what the majority of miners want it to be. That is literally what we use for consensus at the protocol level. If you don't want Bitcoin dictated by the will of those creating blocks, then you kind of need to sell your coins and get out now. 
I say this not as an insult, it's just a technical reality. Bitcoin can and will change over time, and if you want a say you need to be hashing.

@_date: 2014-01-22 01:10:03
The issue is very solvable (and quite easy to develop) but it's a debate between miners and users. Miners need block space to be scarce to drive up fees, and users need block space to be abundent enough for the volume and for fees to justify all potential uses of Bitcoin (eg micropayments). But miners also need this in the long term since more txns = more money.
Changing the numbers requires community consensus, hence the lack of motion on this issue. Developers are also working on something that would scale this automatically so we don't have ridiculous debates every time blocks get full (which reminds me of the US debt ceiling ;) ). I'm unclear on the details of this new system, but that will take time to get working.

Not really. In the UK everything is kind of taxed by default through VAT, regardless of legitimacy. So a legal move like this explicitly legitimises bitcoin because it deals with them.

You aren't ignorant, but you have to **REALLY** understand that Bitcoin is an unproven, beta system. New things happen fairly frequently.

**EDIT**: Please understand that this is *pro Bitcoin*. I think Bitcoin is a good thing and have a heavy investment in it. But I hate to see people jumping in without knowing what they are in for. These are the risks, but they are not without a similarly superlative payoff if things go the way that I and the rest of the subreddit feel they will.

There's the HTML5 Audio API, which [doesn't have 100% browser support]( which is something I've been playing around with (for tests/toys, not in production). Certainly in Chrome as I've been using it for myself, it's awesome and robust.
[Good intro tutorial](
The [sound effects section of this guide]( describes the approach for varying the sounds, but it's fairly simple in the sense that you can speedramp "live" and create many different variants of the same audio by playing it through things like highpasss and lowpass filters, or even combining with something for convolution (a process I haven't tried yet).
It's a little difficult to learn because you have to think of your sound source and the "speakers" as "nodes" on a graph, then you have to connect them to other nodes (like your filters or volume regulator), but if you think of it in your head like connecting wires to different pieces of machinery, it makes some sense.
Let me know if you decide to go down this route, it's a topic of particular interest for me as I'm exploring it's use in games development. And I can help you out with some sample code if what you want is fairly trivial (eg. just a basic playback speed mod like that tutorial).
Bear in mind that it's not formalized as a standard yet though :(

It's not an inflation of the money supply, I agree. It's an inflation of the ACTIVE money supply. Coins sitting in lost or inactive wallets have no bearing on price, but in 20 years from the launch (when there have been at least 5 block halving events, meaning miners earn 1.5625 btc per block) there are going to be sudden 'rereleases' of blocks worth 50 that get redistributed into the active money supply.

You post speaks to a utopian level of security that assumes the block chain can map one-to-one with customer deposits, a view that is not only flawed in performance and usability for customers, but also completely ignores the compartmentalisation and risk management of the cold/hot wallet "airgap".
The traditional banking system has been more than capable of handling these issues. As a developer of simple lobbyist games that no-one plays I have implemented transactional trading systems, in very few lines of code. It is not a difficult attack vector to protect against.
Your proposed solution on the other hand allows any successful attacker to wipe the company's holdings to zero if successful. This is wholly unacceptable, and the defence in depth is needed.

You realise that people *are* going to see us as fringe, right? Until and unless we're mainstream, we are *by definition* the crazy exception to the rule.
This guy just discussed a plausible link between falling gold and rising Bitcoin. That is HUGE. It's not presented as fact (more an interesting theory) but come on: this is the biggest evidence I've seen in a long time of BTC being treated seriously and yet you all come here and take issue with the little chuckle and being called a "nut" in jest? (Something which any enthusiast of a precious metal or commodity would also be called, simply because of their enthusiasm).

Your angry replies and baseless accusations/ad hominems against my character miss the purpose and the practicalities of bitcoin as it exists today. You also seem to think that the bitcoin economy could exist without these external services (it would, but it'd be an order of magnitude smaller). 
Your mining example is a perfect one. The blockchain exists, but pools are needed for "usability" (reduced variance). Barring P2Pool (which has technical challenges that need to be overcome before it's a defacto standard) our decentralized system allows anyone to launch, join and leave these pools. But then people like you suggest that this isn't decentralization, because despite the zero barrier to entry for launching/switching pools you suggest that this is mining centralisation.
You'd probably say the same thing about SPV clients over full nodes too. It's the same principle. Clearly we should all be forced to run full nodes.
People can use bitcoin to do **whatever they want**. Ecommerce people are flocking to easy solutions like Bitpay that limit their exposure to bitcoin. Others are diving in directly. That's all fine because BTC is the TCP of payments: it just has to relay and blockify good transactions while rejecting the bad.
I shall say no more beyond that which I've already outlined since you'll either get it or you won't.

I'm not saying they should demonize him. At the very least they need to (as an example) issue a public statement stating that due to a pending serious legal investigation his position on the board is temporarily suspended, pending the results of the case.

In 20 years after the first coins "mature" on the blockchain there would be a massive inflation of unknown size or scope.
That's not to say you couldn't change these parameters but the point is that the lack of easy foresight into the future money supply would be a very bad thing!

The thing is though I agree with your premise. The existence and promotion of Dogecoin is great for Bitcoin, probably one of the better things to happen to it! But that doesn't mean doge has any real viability as a cryptocurrency.
At least with Doge people for the most part were treating it as a toy. Then it started to get "serious" and people started throwing real money at it...

But pay attention to the news should that advice change. I see now problems with TC 7.1, but it makes sense to "change the DEFCON", as it were.
Your wallet should also be encrypted anyway, so if someone breaks TC they have to breach the next layers to do anything useful.

This is the problem. Her interviews make it clear that this *is the best lead they found*. So basically they got nothing, bit they decided to clutch at straws anyway.

I wouldn't mind, but no arguments are even presented here. We're just supposed to accept that there has to be someone at the helm, yet the article never makes the case for "why".
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:48:14
Whike I'm cautiously enthusiastic, you really need to make this definition your TOP priority. Either the system will interact in the network correctly, with the correct game theory and technical set up such that people can't "break" or "abuse" these services, or it won't. When Satoshi released his proof of work/blockchain paper we didn't have an implementation but it didn't matter because the math worked.
Until I see evidence that the claims you are making have a technical basis it's really hard to get enthusiastic. Please note that I DO want you to be right, and I do commend your early release - but know that a number of us can't get excited about what you're promising until we see concrete technical details of this proof bandwidth scheme that you propose. 
Honestly I think you might have jumped the gun a bit, getting the bitcoin community at large interested in such groundbreaking technology while you arm-wave the core details might be a recipe for disaster if there's some oversight in the protocol design. If I were you i'd focus on documenting these techniques and submit them to the community at large before you start trying to raise awareness and resources for an implementation.
Again please do interpret this as constructive criticism: I'm not trying to bash your project or imply that it's in any way dishonest/unable to deliver on it's claims.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:59:17
Yeah, I just think he could and should have just told people to read the article - he only says the same stuff he's been posting on bitcointalk for years! Shame he has to preemptively defend himself but us Bitcoiners are a suspicious bunch I guess...
@_date: 2014-04-06 09:16:23
It really does not work. You are making assumptions without looking into the technologies involved.
Fundamentally, hashing has to be something that's hard to work on but is **knowably provable**. Any scientific grid computing project has, by definition, unknowable answers (else why are we doing the work in the first place!), and thus is useless to Bitcoin.

Would be cool if we could put the pruned node data into something like a DHT, such that every client just persists a chunk of the data by default.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:36:59
This would work if it weren't for the fact that early Satoshi was just as strict about security as later Satoshi. He did everything using anonymous mail services, left very few traces, and bolted as soon as Gavin mentioned the FBI briefing. Real satoshi had good operational security, and it's hard to imagine that changing.
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:29:50
I don't think it's that silly, it just represents a short term loss of confidence in bitcoin as a whole. It's not unreasonable to imagine people seeing the bullet they just dodged and reevaluating just how much they can afford to lose.

Come on. If you're involved with pseudononymously traceable cryptocurrency the state is going to subject your dealings to higher scrutiny: it's a fact of life. The only way this is going to change (and stop banks treating Bitcoins like Uranium) is to weed out the Charlie Sheen's of the world. 
If the underground economy wants to use Bitcoin, they can do it themselves, but they can face the consequences without impacting the Foundation or the Bitcoin community as a whole.

All data storage is probabilistic. Disks fail, datacenters go offline. A DHT is no different and given the correct parameters can ensure availability as needed.
Think of it this way: if half the full nodes in the blockchain had the data, it'd still be there: there's more than two nodes at all times and half the network isn't going to be offline simultaneously. Yet the cost of blockchain storage is halved. A DHT just changes that ratio.

Even trading using a barter system is subject to capital gains. They don't care if you're buying goods with £1000 of bitcoins or £1000 of sheep: if it's a yield from an investment then it is as I understand it classed as a taxable event at the point of sale, as though you had converted the £1000 to GBP at the instant of the purchase.

Bigger blocks provide the **opportunity** for miners to accept more fees by hashing more data. They do not provide the guarantee that blocks will be filled in the slightest!
A healthy fee market would still develop since fees would have to offset the time spent validating transactions before publishing the solution - every millisecond is a risk that someone else found a solution to the same problem before you. But generally for well connected nodes outside of the Great Firewall it's going to be beneficial to cram more transactions in there.

Taking the string "bitcoin:address..." and performing an action on it (eg when clicked). Typically you want this to take you to a page in an app/program that gloves you the option to pay with info pre filled like the address.
What this very important warning message will hopefully deter is people making their software send the bitcoins immediately once this URI is dereferenced. If anyone is dumb enough to do that, people will have many ways of getting software like browsers to call these URIs like Iframes and JavaScript.

Of all political issues that British people like myself care about, Romney's tax filings are very low on the agenda. I'm more fussed about the "interesting" use of Bitcoin in this story, and how it might affect bitcoin's future should the wrong people become irked by such overt criminal activities.

A bitcoin-day is simply Every day a bitcoin is "at rest" (stuck in a wallet) is multiplied by the value of the coins. These days are "destroyed" when a trade occurs, as the days start from zero again. So it's just 
    
    coins_moved*time_since_coins_last_moved
This is useful because it both "downweights" the sort of daytrading nonsense that doesn't really affect bitcoin, and it "upweights" people spending their coins on real stuff after holding on to coins for ages.
If you think about it, we aren't really interested in measuring hourly mtgox trading blips and things. We're interested in seeing what happens as bitcoin is used for real purposes. We're also interested to see what early adopters (who might have many coins) are doing with their coins, as spreading "hoarded" coins around is a good thing for stability (prevents a mass sell by an early adopter hitting the price too much)

It's like a reddit account. If you create a new account every time you comment then noone can trace you. If, however, you use the same account (even though it can be called  "oiifheriughbkjz" or whatever) people can look at your previous comments and narrow stuff down to you.
In bitcoin, when money moves it's effectively a public reddit comment (in this analogy). Someone can look into your past and slowly narrow down who you are (maybe based on timestamps trading with something outside the system, like, say, if MtGox had been hacked (or "the man" had got to them), they could totally link that MtGox account with all the transactions through the system back to you.

Every time electricity is devoted to the bitcoin networks, it's immutability increases. I consider it to be incredibly efficient given the additional benefits that we gain from Bitcoin over fiat (control). Additionally, electricity can be renewable and non-wasteful, this is something that is outside the control of Bitcoin itself. Fiat, by comparison, is inherently wasteful with millions of notes, coins and paperwork needed to be printed that in essence scales per transaction, rather than a "constant" effect like mining. (Per transaction because the more coins/notes are used, the more they need replacing)
For computer scientists, that's O(n) vs O(1), and is "another way to measure" the efficiency like OP asked.

The problem is that large companies are in a transition phase now. But they are not going to spend the time transitioning to some bitcoin based system, when their ultimate goal is to completely digitize everything.


There are MANY simple systems of doing so, and a company can spend a small amount of money to BUILD a simple system themselves if they really need to: probably easier than figuring out bitcoin payment integration plugins for your Word Processor of choice (Hint: if it's a big corp, it's MS Word and isn't going to change)

The miners are the same people as those with a big stake in Bitcoin. Plus these people wish to preserve their value as generated and won't want anyone to muck about with it risking their assets and dividing the marketplace. Anyone who's anyone in your scenario is compelled by game theory to stick with the canonical block chain, and you offer zero reasoning for how that could ever not be the case.
Please not I say this neither optimistically nor pessimistically: there are benefits and drawbacks to the conservative approach that is hard baked into any monetary system. I say this only as a pragmatist.
Your argument seems to hinge on "if another block chain became dominant, everyone would switch", but this is almost tautological since you are already starting from close to the victory position.

The way the companies that are on there verify is by periodically including training data in results, that they know the answer to. That way, they can test users occasionally and if they are getting too many wrong answers can review sites manually. It's the same kind of thing as mturk, or even recaptcha since one word is always a training word and the other digitizes books.

Now I find the unqualified logic somewhat false but I see the point you may have been trying to make. Like it or not, bitcoin hacks are a problem with Bitcoin, from a perception point of view. Bitcoin are a lucrative target, more so than traceable, reversible legacy currencies. The Bitcoin community is also small enough that these attacks have effects and consequences beyond their monetary damages, and as businesses are smaller and less professional it's slim pickings to choose targets and unrecoverably drain a company's funds.
Only time will tell if Bitcoin can shake this: either through vendors getting hardened and understanding the increased security burden of holding the holy grail of pseudo-untraceable cryptocurrency, though increased user awareness and risk aversion when it comes to money that's  "in the cloud" and not under your control, or just people accepting losses and that's the way the world works without insurance. Or maybe we'll get trustworthy insurance schemes, I didn't know.

I agree, it's a bit of a step backward. Wouldn't be so bad if the tiers were "AND" gates (so you can sell valuable items slowly or loads of cheapo stuff) but it's pretty bad for a market. I think demand has meant their bots simply have too much inventory, and this is one way to cut down on sales while they online more bots. I hope they at least shift the first tiers up in quota and prevent it from downtiering inactive users.

@_date: 2012-12-03 19:52:33
Can't stand the forums. People seem to assume that the world will change overnight just because the technology is there. The reality is they hurt bitcoin's image as a low cost and near instant solution to sending money around the world, and it is nothing more than an upgrade to me. I do like the deflationary aspect but christ, the forums, the bitcoin media, even this subreddit, you all make it out to be a cult! It will succeed despite the rabid libertarian fanboys putting everyone else off, but seriously...

I can't solidly put it into words, and I urge others to fact check the specifics, but basically every node in bitcoin talks to every other node, but they can't trust each other (otherwise, like you say, we could just say "I have 11 billion coins lol" and the other nodes would accept it). So instead, every time coins move around the network, there is a cryptographic challenge that must be passed. Similarly to secure websites (https), your wallet.dat has a number of public and private keys. The public keys are the "addresses" and are known to everybody: it's where you send coins to! Private keys are in your wallet.dat and must be kept safe of course. When coins are moved, the bitcoin network requires proof before accepting the transaction. The network can't know your key, but it CAN ask you a question that is impossible to answer without the key, and also check that you produced a valid answer. This is enough to make sure that nobody can spend your coins, and it also means that no-one can generate new coins apart from by being "lucky" and producing an "answer" that is "good enough", which is exactly what bitcoin mining is: people trying to produce "decent" answers.

No honestly that is absolutely incorrect. The supply of Bitcoin is static. It's demand that falls if Bitcoin are harder to trade. So Bitcoin could only slow growth wise from this.

Reddit is a social news aggregator and community content sharing platform. It performs these roles admirably. It's a completed product (although I'm sure it requires maintenance to scale up to the ridiculous traffic levels). It's not a social network, it's not a music player. Short of reddit enhancement suite (client side tweaks that the reddit team acknowledge as being too expensive to roll out globally, which makes sense since them being opt in is fine) there's nothing to add. The UI is clean and functional, it works fine when EC2 is up, there's no noticeable bugs, and all the content is generated by us. 
Regardless the devs ARE working on stuff. Reddit's codebase is public, remember? Last I heard they were significantly rewriting the core so that it could be sharded across multiple EC2 zones, increasing availability if Amazon (!) goes down in one area. I cannot put into perspective how much of a complex and unique problem this is at the scale that reddit operates at. In the meantime they have an anti spam codebase to constantly tune, corrupted EC2 instances to fix, and stuff we don't even see. It's a miracle this thing works at all.

They won't continue on "happily". It's not something that just happens. Assuming a somewhat symmetric fork/persist split you have half the network left for securing the blockchains, half the merchants accepting each currency. Bitter wars being fought by factions instead of people being constructive. DDOSers everywhere, just because they can. A forking might happen, and in the very long run it might even work. But don't kid yourself into thinking it would be anywhere near painless at this point.
@_date: 2012-10-09 20:48:44
The "information" includes time though when you show the building process. I wouldn't say it's gimmocky when it pretty accurately maps the relationship between time and connections in a general way. The last frame is useless but it's all about the jour eyes (maaaan!)

I'm not saying modem trickles. You need a constant connection, but you only need at least one. Things propagate faster than you think, and clock sync with bitcoin isn't so bad: it's not quite as real time as you might think by virtue of the block system.
If ANY route external to the "blackout" exists, bitcoin can thrive. So you are really counting on someone cutting off all ties to all countries and actively (and skillfully) enforcing infringement. It might go down for hours at a time but you can't stop the signal when the populace are hungry, their blockchains just need "charging" every now and again and the required transactions will circulate.

Because it basically relies on the honour system: the other person can chargeback or file dispute and walk away with the coins at no cost with no risk to themselves. The people listing the coins are assuming that 50% of bitcoin purchasers are honest, but considering that people can make a quick buck out there I'm surprised they are that cheap. Would you give me  a bitcoin if I said I'd give you the cash later without having the luxury of researching your buyer at all? Thought not.

Highly doubt miners are savvy enough to quickly capitalize on this kind of scenario. I doubt 50% of miners check the bitcoin forums in a month, let alone within 2 hours (12 blocks). And miners are taking a huge risk to accept this: if I "defect" and get your 100 shiny bitcoins but no-one else joins me, the whole chain is still invalidated.
What you are proposing is simply the kind of attack that would happen if 51%+ of bitcoin users defect from the standard network. Frankly if that happens we have bigger problems.

Bitcoin itself isn't, in my opinion. This recent price-splosion will pop/"correct", but I doubt we'll go below $2. The "value" of the Bitcoin has truly increased through organic means by media exposure, which is creating more scarcity, driving the demand whilst supply is fixed.

In 2030 something, when this starts to be an issue, bitcoin will either have failed, or will be VERY successful.

Folding? I think it's floating point, but I could be wrong. I know it's GPU accelerated though. The problem is the lack of market: it may be ahead of it's time, but only if Moore's Law stops working and our machines stop improving at a vast scale, or if there are new trends and possibilities that require masses of GPU power. It'd take a severeish engineering effort to get such a global network working in real time (as opposed to standard WorkUnit-&gt;Submit type models) but it would be exciting stuff! I just don't see it happening any time soon when industries are big on "Cloud" computing and having their own army of virtual machines sitting in some datacentre, as opposed to something a bit more technically democratic.

The coins will disappear and no new ones appear. If the supply of anything goes down, the price of that thing goes up. The only difference is that with bitcoin we just move the decimal point along: when it starts being a problem we use millibitcoins and so on. Losses and "limboed" coins do not pose a threat, although it would be interesting if old wallets are found after 5/10/30 years as the value of the coins within will be considerably higher!

The coins are (in my mind) little vaults with keyholes in them. Your bitcoin address (the long alphanumeric string) is the physical location of the vault, and your Bitcoin client contains a "wallet.dat" file which represents you set of keys for these vaults. If your PC goes boom and you didn't back up your bitcoin clients, the money stays in the vault but no-one has any keys! Since "bitcoin locksmiths" don't exist, the strong recommendation is to copy your keys and keep them somewhere else! You can do this by copying the wallet.dat file for backups. It's advised you do this regularly, since your client will get different keys after more transactions, so you want it all to be completely backed up.


You don't have a named account (bitcoin people love anonymity) but there is one or more *address* as mentioned above that you can send and recieve bitcoins to. Only you have the keys to sign transactions using the coins you control, so that's how it works. The entire network knows that account X has Y coins, but we can't spend them or know anything about the identity of the person who can.


First of all, CPU mining is simply not profitable: you'll spend more on power than you'll ever earn. GPU mining (using your graphics cards rather than your processor) is the way to go. If you have the equipment, the better way to mine is by using a mining client: a piece of software designed to work with graphics cards and solely mine as efficiently as possible. Examples are [here]( [here]( and [here]( They require a little knowledge of the command line on your operating system, but let me know if you have comments/questions.
The "Generating" option on the official client is so useless now in terms of successful generation that there was a forum thread discussing it's removal. Personally, I do not have the hardware to profitably mine, but I set my roommate up (he's a hardcore PC gamer with powerful graphics cards) and he's earned over 100 coins (and will be paying more than his share for electricity :D)

Mostly investor types (in bulk anyway). People think the value will go up (and due to the deflationary nature of the currency it's less risky than other typical investments) will buy some to sell later. For comparison, I spent £60 on coins, and bought in when the value per coin was 0.6. Also, people who wish to get into using bitcoin are better off buying than trying to mine with poor hardware: at this point it costs more for the electricity to try and mine (unless you are using a GPU).
I personally see myself providing bitcoin related webservices with these coins, and maybe I'll make some purchases. It's also a long term investment for me though.


    
Anyone whio is *successfully* mining above the cost for electricity is using GPUs. As for it's utilization rate, I can only really offer [this]( "From the official forums") thread as an answer, as I don't really mine (my roommate does though, and makes a profit despite his added share of the electricity bill :)


    
They could, I could start generating "GigitrixCoins" tomorrow. The problem is, that no-one accepts these as a currency. The currency only has value if people use it. You could easily see how this has other applications though: I could start an MMO that has realworld elements and uses an alternate blockchain, for instance. Let me stress: an alternate blockchain creates completely different currency.


    
Each copy of bitcoin enforces the difficulty increase by calculating the new difficulty individually. If I said the difficulty is only "1", then the other nodes in the network say that my calculation is invalid and it doesn't go any further.

It's all or nothing: I don't think there's a failure mode where bitcoin "stagnates" and you lose "a little" of your investment. Maybe you could put in $10, $5 or just mine for a little bit (however inefficiently) just so that you have some BTC to your name? 5 years from now, there is a very real possibility that fractions of bitcoins might be worth a bit!

Yeah, that's the first ever miner (it's built into Bitcoin itself) and the mass need of people to get one over on their peers caused an arms race that moved people away from this code, and onto better miners.

Imagine all payments in the world go through the Postal System. Checks or cash in the mail, whatever.


They are your address: much like a physical one for receiving checks in the mail! Difference is, you can set up as many houses as you like (for free with zero effort), and the world does not know who has keys to which house.    
    


The easy answer: in the program you downloaded. In truth the Bitcoin client application creates a "wallet.dat" file which contains these keys. I don't know what format the keys are in, but you can gain access to "your" Bitcoin account through just this file.


The wallet.dat is all you'd need, but you'd have to make sure to be consistent. If you make a trade it changes the data in the wallet.dat, and therefore if you use multiple computers you need to make sure you are always using the most recent wallet.dat or bitcoin might get confused and attempt to spend coins that do not belong to you. This attempt would fail, of course ;)


You just posted a check into a random house. Who knows if it has people in it, or if it is empty. Difference is, in Bitcoin, houses are impregnable without the key. Theoretically you could try to generate keys, but as I'm sure you've guessed by now you'd have more chance winning every lottery from now until the end of 2012...
@_date: 2011-06-02 22:57:46
That machine is unsuitable for bitcoin mining. You might be able to get a bitcent after a solid week or two, but that's about it.
If you wish to do so, search for a Bitcoin Mining Pool (preferably one with low fees) and research installing and configuring a "bitcoin miner". Without joining a pool you are less "generating coins" and more "Trying to win the 50BTC lottery).
@_date: 2011-06-17 18:06:45
Not really, since alternative risk management solutions exist such as banking and insurance. Also, paper money is pretty theft-proof by default since the "default" mode of operation involves sticking large amounts of it in the bank, and carrying small amounts in a wallet in a pocket, requiring force and or subterfuge via a physical contact.

Unfortunately, the way hashing is, only graphics cards should really be used for mining. My roommate here in the UK did the numbers and you just can't make any money on CPU mining because you pay more for power than you gain in bitcoins (or the bitcoin value in usd: you might as well just buy some!). If you can get any of the CUDA or OpenCL miners to work though, you'll be in business. With that macbook pro, it sounds like if you can get it working you'll be easily into 5 figure khash/s.

Well if you have a significant amount of cash in physical notes, you research and buy a safe generally. I don't think it's wrong to assume this would happen for Bitcoin, and I'm sure there's people who can come up with Bitcoin specific services that handle this sort of thing for the average consumer. Or, you know, just use a "bank" essentially. Just because bitcoin is decentralised doesn't mean it's going to be 100% democratic if we don't need that: centralised services will exist, but they are optional. That is the key.

GPUs are made for maths, because graphics = tons of triangles moving everywhere. CPUs are more general purpose, and aren't meant to have such raw power.
Compare a car you would pick for drag racing, vs a car you would pick for your family commute. The drag car is good for one thing and one thing only, and bitcoin mining is all about the raw performance, which suits it well.

I don't know about now (since it might crash a bit and take a while to climb naturally back up again) but yes, I definitely think so. I bought in at $0.60 per btc so I'm doing pretty well :)
If you are thinking years then you'll definitely beat inflation, barring any international incidents affecting bitcoin like government regulation or network takeovers. The first of these will likely cause a Streissand Effect (but you might have legal issues) and the second is theoretically impossible, given the size of the current bitcoin economy, and is growing ever smaller.

It's one of those things thats a bitch to understand, but providing you know important things (no chargebacks) it does "just work". The client software is interchangeable and it's entirely possible to believe that in a world of smartphones and connectivity it would be a completely viable technology for the high street. Easy to use clients could be made for normal users, without worrying about sharing bitcoin addresses: it could just be an interaction between two phones, for example, who communicate their addresses over secured bluetooth.

The bitcoin blockchain is the backbone, not the be all and end all of bitcoin. You can do just that, but it carries some risk of double spending, just as the banks assume some risk with fast payment. People can choose to insure that risk, and thus the fast payment system is born.
Or more simply, imagine bitcoin is cash. People have built the idea of a "credit card" on top of the basic paradigm of cash. So it will hopefully be as bitcoin matures. It risks some centralization but it's a completely free market, so there should theoretically be great competition. And there's always the baseline of "naked" bitcoin to compete against so it's not like there is ever a true "monopoly" risk.

Even if it goes lower, it's going to be worth more than it was on the big surge up. Bitcoin works like a normal stock: the up and down is like a normal stock, etc. But the difference is that behind standard up and down there is a baseline level of "up" as the coins get scarcer, as more people are introduced into the network, as this causes mining difficulty increases etc. Every "surge" resets, but it resets to a position about halfway between baseline, pre-surge values, and the top of the "surge". Personally, I reckon we are destined for around $6, but it'll soon zoom off when press hit  kicks off.

Worst comes to the worst, the attacker would get a database full of random data (as happened here) and they'd try and brute force it. Of course, since you would use the lastpass password generator, it's pretty unbruteforceable, even with an offline, GPU accelerated attack.

I spent a week pondering the intricacies, and am now building websites that support bitcoin. If anyone has questions, other than the really technical details (eg the actual programming in C, internal data structures) I can answer most questions on bitcoin stuff, from how it works to "how come people don't just do x". Please ask away, I want more people to understand and use it :)

It's a combination of a bubble, and a genuine price rise due to increased demand due to an explosion in media attention and exposure. The "bubble" part will burst, but there's definitely a current of real value underneath it. I'd be really really surprised if it "pops" below $3, most likely it will settle around $5 IMHO.

It's simple: the transaction fees. I could either sign a 50.00 BTC block, or a 51.50 BTC block with some transactions in it worth 1.50 in fees. It's a no-brainer. If fees are ever so low that miners refuse to include them in blocks, then you're going to have to pony up for the fees. But it'll be insanely hard to form any kind of cartel when so many people own there own mining hardware, can switch pools etc.

EC2 is a service. Bitcoin is an economic model. Of course you can create a service and get people to pay, but you cannot just bolt that into something like bitcoin: you can't just armwave that feature in. The work done by bitcoin is cryptographically secure and verifyable. Any other work done has no bearing on bitcoin's security and could not be used for mining.

Unfortunately people like you, me and probably 99.9% of redditors represent the technical elite in this world, revered by family and friends alike for our seemingly godlike ability to google solutions to their diverse technical problems.

It has become a legitimate commodity. There's no arguing about that. Whether it can become a successful currency is dependent on how many people start accepting bitcoin as a business.

The idea that this community's arrogance extends towards policing linguistics is the first clue here. We spent years defining a blockchain as a distributed write-only ledger to anyone who would take us seriously. Then "the big baddies" want to use a piece of the tech in a different context and people want to fight about semantics so they aren't associated with "evil" banks.
Meanwhile the whole ecosystem is falling apart under it's own weight and the weight of it's poisoned community. But y'know, super important that people in fintech don't keep calling things blockchains!
This whole thing is just a small part of the problem of course. Bitcoiners as a community refuse to engage with anyone outside of a very specific (statistically fringe) worldview and actively harm the project by doing so. Now those are views I am 90% in agreement with or at least sympathetic to, but as it stands today there is no way to even dip one's toe in without being aggressively sold the whole package, destruction of debt based economy, denouncement of all fiat and all.
I had assumed from the early days that we'd branch out, become more accepting of those who just want to y'know, pay for things. Or use one of many other applications that put cryptocurrencies in the "cool" pile. But that has not happened. Price adjustments are meaningless when the community is insistent on BTC being a purely libertarianesque anarchesque ideological movement instead of a technology stack. It's remained isolated, and the conflicts underneath the developer community reflect this isolation. 
Bitcoin is now known to everyone. But bitcoin is known to everyone as a punchline, and the community is to blame for that.

What's happening (and I forget the **absolute** specifics) is that your machine is trying to hash some data using a function. There's a salt that your PC can change. But the rules of the game are that you have to try and get a hash that is literally numerically LOWER than some defined value. If you do it, you shout it out to the rest of the network, you "show your working" of sorts to us and then you get to pocket the mined bitcoins, whilst also signing any transactions since the last block, and making sure that those transactions are legit.
The reason for the masses of computer power are less "free money" from the protocol's point of view, and more "securing the network". If the bad guys get too much of a say in what's "valid" and what isn't then they could cause mischief, so mass distributing the network like this stops those attacks since someone would need about 4 supercomputers to do anything!
@_date: 2011-06-10 22:39:46

Well basically you want to remake EC2, and it has nothing to do with bitcoin? OK then, but there is a **massive** trust issue. Distributed computing cannot rely on trusting the servers in **any** way, so running full blown VMs in nodes is a **HUGE** no. The most tasks you could probably do are things that run on BOINC: there's not a huge selection since things have to be:    
* Massively Parallel
* Deterministic, Repeatable Answers (so that typically 4 nodes run the same computation, making cheating improbable)
* Not Time Sensitive (The workunits propagate through the network).
I just can't see such a system having much commercial interest. GPGPU computing remains a highly niche field, and there's absolutely no way that you can just "borrow" someone's machine in an anonymous network like Bitcoin's and trust the output. Distributed computing only works under very specific circumstances, and the uses are mostly scientific and/or research based: most commercial institutions wouldn't trust external peers with their data.

To elaborate an ASIC is an "Application Specific Integrated Circuit" - which is a circuit designed SOLELY to do Bitcoin hashing on a vast scale with the smallest possible power consumption. There's no way a GPU can compete because it is designed (much like most hardware like CPUs and graphics cards) to do a great number of different things that a programmer would want them to do. An ASIC just has to be able to hash for mining, which is what makes them so fast and energy efficient.

Oh wow you finally started scraping the barrel! It took long enough for you to even start naming the things that are the actual stated objectives of the project, but here we go. So faster confirmations. ~7.5 minutes worth of time saved on a transaction. Sounds good on paper right? 
Except that barely anyone cares nor will they. ~10 minutes is a fine amount of time to wait PROVIDING that you care about the single confirmation. But of course that's not acceptable for, say a coffee shop or a retail outlet. **But nor is 2.5 minutes**. You can't have people awkwardly hovering around while the blockchain does it's thing every time and compete with a debit or credit card! So of course what ACTUALLY happens is someone underwrites the risk of an unconfirmed transaction, takes their 2% of the value or whatever, and the coffee shop owner instantly gets their 98% from a trusted address with absolutely zero chargeback risk.
Litecoin offers a solution to a non-existent problem, and it's a solution that doesn't work because it's still too slow to meet the stated goals. Unless you can think of a **purpose** for these faster confirmations you just named a fact about Litecoin rather than something that is useful.

I also share the concern of people in this thread. Are you buying ASICs?  FPGAs? GPUs? Do you have enough host computing for these? Can you guarantee power, network and operating system uptime to be as close to 100% as possible? Are you capable of troubleshooting, installing and updating software on these devices, most likely through command line interfaces? Have you selected a mining pool that is capable of dealing with the load of your rig without increasing latency too much?

Well that's not a benefit so much as limitation of a drawback. And when the blockchains get bigger duplicated clients are going to cost significant amounts of money. 


And? Again you're framing a drawback in a positive light (namely that there are competing standards for the same product). I can convert between .docx and .odf documents very easily, doesn't mean both should be standards.


BTC is **INCREDIBLY** divisible to 8dp. It's utter nonsense to suggest that BTC is tooo expensive. But what you really mean is that you think the value of BTC is overinflated, so you'd rather diversify into an instrument that might as well be a lottery, since it is pure speculation.


As is SatoshiDice. Further emphasising that altchains are nothing more than speculative gamblers looking for a get rich quick scheme, half of which who will lose their money when the bigger fish bail on you.


Utter nonsense. LTC offers two exact changes: shorter blockchains that serve no non-academic purpose, and a changed mining algorithm that suckers people into thinking mining is more "fair". It offers nothing else. Any bug in Bitcoin is present in Litecoin. Any volatility in Bitcoin affects Litecoin.


So... Rather than use Bitcoin (which is "too valuable") people would rather put their hard earned Bitcoin into Litecoins, because they are less valuable... [What](

It's only my aversion to people getting scammed by altchains that provide no value that stops me taking this concept seriously.

The wiki and bitcoin users generally can't articulate WHY Litecoin is a scam without sounding like hating the competition. But just understand that by investing in altchains, your wealth is at the mercy of a tiny number of users who can manipulate markets at whim, markets that only exist in theory as the coins have little use.
Bitcoin of course went through the "useless" stage and came out the other end because of it's raw potential. Ask yourself what Litecoin offers that Gigitrixcoin couldn't down the road? [It ain't the only altchain out there](

Ripple is a wholly different system that centers around debt and is excluded from my arguments. Proof of stake systems haven't taken off and add more complexity into a system that is ultimately working. 
The 51% logic is completely false because this is a zero-sum game: any hashing power not pointed at Bitcoin and pointed at an altchain equates to reduced security of the blockchain.
Scrypt does not protect against anything other than vulnerabilities in SHA256, which would immediately result in a temporary block chain suspension/hard fork.

Provide evidence that bitcoin cannot and will not provide for an adequate number of transactions per second. A faster growing blockchain just means less transactions are assigned to the block in each step, it doesn't mean Litecoin can handle more transactions. If bitcoin ever hit scalability problems the master blockchain would solve the problem or be forked there and then, when an alt chain **would** provide value. Spinning off a new blockchain is effortless at that point if the worst came to the worst and it were even needed. Litecoin however is a solution in search of a non-existent problem.

It'd be expensive, but the point is the more Litecoin grows the more attractive it would become. And the more Litecoin miners that are added are still not an order of magnitude near such an ASIC (or even FPGA). It remains a threat that could be realised throughout Litecoins use cycle.
Now, Bitcoin has come out of that ONLY because companies like Avalon acted in good faith and decided not to hoard (now that their good faith increases the value of the bitcoin and ultimately promises them more income is another story). But consider that any Bitcoiner with access to funds and the technical inclination could do this and mine out a ton of litecoins, flooding the market and making a quick buck.
Bitcoin, in it's early days, had to compete with the governments who knew nothing and didn't care about Bitcoin. Now we're at a good stage where huge ASIC power is coming online to protect the network. Litecoin has to compete with Bitcoiners, and it remains to be seen hiw exactly it's going to be manipulated.

Well I'd argue they are. But that's not to say everything is luck based: there are people demonstrably "better" at Poker than the rest of us and they make careers out of the risk (much the same as a wall street banker is able to exceed inflation).
It's rather silly not to "invest" surplus capital given that there are exceedingly low risk paths to go down that still beat "it sitting in a bank account". But let's not pretend that the psychology behind "banking on {companyX}'s future performance" is any different from "banking on {horseX}'s ability to win the race given prior form". Yes one is different from the other but they share a similar skillset and people have transitioned between the two fields.
Regardless of all this, my intent with the obnoxious bold capitals is to reach the OP, because everyone is sending him the same message but it isn't getting through to him. It's tragic for the sister involved, couldn't care less what happens to him honestly. Well I do actually, I hope he gets help for his addiction problems: I wish bankruptcy and financial hardship on no-one, and that's where he's headed.

I'll care about an Altcoin when it brings a single useful new idea to the table. Namecoin had potential for this (being based on Satoshi's BitDNS idea) but the implementation is flawed. Litecoin's "benefits" are smoke and mirrors that don't provide society a single benefit over BTC. And others are just permutations of LTC and BTC with new ideas about coin distribution (inflationary ones etc) which is a pointless problem to solve and fundamentally alters the economics of a traditional deflationary cryptocurrency, which completely damages the incentive to participate.

This sounds like your typical altcoin. I'm concerned by the preseeding and reservation of 10% of mastercoins. I'm not sure that what it promises is stuff that falls outside of the scope of the core bitcoin protocol.

While I think there are some great ideas and features being discussed I'm very very VERY hesitant to support this project.

Electronic Voting is evil, period. Internet voting more so. I am no Luddite but these systems are obscene, and my being a programmer only highlights my distrust.
We just don't have a proper way of tying crypto to one-and-only-one person. Either we trust the government as we always have, or we just make the world a "wealthocracy" and make it official. 1 BTC = 1 Vote, screw the poor. I'd rather stick with today's "broken" system than that frankly.

@_date: 2013-03-11 03:36:18
A "coin" doesn't really exist, what does exist is sums of money transferring across addresses. So we know 5 BTC moved from Address A to Address B but there aren't 5 desperate pieces of anything: it's just a number.
The public ledger can only track movements of coins though: our previous example gets more interesting since we have to know where those 5 BTC came from (ie you didn't just make them up) so we look up the blockchain. Turns out you paid those 5 coins from 2 addresses, one with 3BTC and one with 2BTC. So any tracking works like this based on addresses and the amounts moving between addresses. 
The block chain knows where every single coin that ever existed has ever been address-wise, from the moment that coin was created through a valid mining block to where it currently sits, unspent.
I strongly recommend you send coins to your friend through Bitcoin rather than messing around with multiple wallet.dat files on the same machines. Going anywhere near the filesystem lime this adds a nonzero chance of human error.
So the ultimate answer to your question is "kind of": what you really need to know is that in order to price you "have" some amount of Bitcoins those coins must be traced from their humble beginnings across all of their previous transactions, which tie Bitcoin addresses to specific coins.
If this is a problem for you however it seems "Coin mixing services" attempt to provide anonymity, though I can. Say little about their methodology or effectiveness because I'm perfectly fine with the pseudononymous nature of being tied only to Bitcoin addresses.

Either 
* They are selling you something that is unprofitable, making money on the delta between normal mining and your premium.
* The price is good but it's a scam.
* They are legit and needed initial investment. But there are other ways to do this involving less risk to the consumer.

Frankly I don't want to offend but my original statement absolutely stands.

Then as the market matures these merchants may decide not to use USD 'crutches'. Or they may not, it's their choice.

I think you fundamentally misunderstand this doomsday scenario. If the sky falls as you suggest, there would be a hard fork on the blockchain.

"Guiminer" is great, and I use "Slush's Pool" ( Guiminer is super simple and you can choose from a wide selection of different pools. Slush's was the first mining pool and I've tried loads but I have no real preference.
Once you know what you are doing you can try different pools but of you want to get started today I'd say download guiminer and set it up with Slush's pool. Let me know what hash rate you get (in Mhash/s) and I can give you a rough estimate of whether it's worth it or not :)

I'd venture that the proliferation of ASICs has no real impact on price whatsoever. The price affects how much people want to invest in Mining, not the other way around! Joe Public just wants to speculate or horde right now, just as they always have.

That's the thing though: nothing really **IS** comparably volatile. The examples don't stack up. Instead of accepting bitcoin's volatility as a trait that it currently has (for a plethora of perfectly understandable reasons) posts like these serve only as unconvincing excuses.
Trying to suggest that bitcoin is 'normal' in this sense will convince nobody: it just makes us sound like a cult. Explaining the volatility and how the risk/reward ratio is so heavily skewed in our favor even in the face of such challenges is a far better investment of your time than making up feeble excuses for Bitcoin's performance in this area.

I'm just paying forward the downvotes I'm getting for discussing Litecoin in a negative light, not that I mind starting from a level 0. I've upvoted both your posts since you're so concerned about karma.
* Provide evidence that litecoin can handle more transactions (and not just by contrasting with Bitcoin's arbitrary limits which can and will be adjusted as newer versions of the software comes out).
* Provide evidence that this increased number of transactions are in any way required, given that the Bitcoin ecosystem is under active development and will have to be updated to remain competitive, just as Litecoin would need active developers.
* Provide evidence that a transaction confirmation rate of ~2.5 minutes is in any way more desirable than 10 considering that it's still too low for a meatspace point of sale (you can't just stand idly by the counter at a coffee shop for 4-5 minutes every time there's an unlucky block, and 2.5 is too slow).
Also it's worth noting that the money moves just as fast in either blockchain (assuming the same network topography) it's just that Litecoin signs the transactions 7.5 minutes faster. But you still can't use Litecoin at point of sale (You'd instead get a trusted third party insurer to manage risk and immediately pass the coins through minus their fees, which would allow for such an instant transfer).
Litecoin is an idea that sounds good on paper but when you analyse the actual stated benefits it offers little else than crpytocurrency fragmentation.

I've written browser extensions before. They are components of an existing platform with less restrictions than the browser sandbox model.
And of course the source for these extensions is the third party chrome/mozilla directories you linked to (appstores) which are coercible and can deliver any arbitrary plugin instead of the one Blockchain upload to them. Or they could be compelled to remove the product entirely which puts Blockchain's livelihood at the mercy of these third parties (compared to the open web).

That's because lame block chain clones are of little interest and serve only to dilute the holdings of those using Bitcoin. I would support a genuinely innovative fork or usage of a blockchain system but Litecoin offered nothing other than a ridiculous notion of "fairness" that would always be defeated by technological progress (and was), and Namecoin is an interesting solution to a barely acknowledged problem but with a lack of control over supply and demand of domain names and a higher barrier to entry for an ultimately less revolutionary system than global payment. 
People mock these systems because they are flawed and represent a bit of a "gold rush" as communities latch on to the blockchain concept, making minor tweaks. Innovation is always good of course, but there's a certain cultlike devotion to all the various blockchains that is easy to criticise (and yes, an outsider would have similar reaction to Bitcoin itself)

Hardly. It's the opposite, a statement intending to prove the idiocy of suggesting that we could ever choose whether to participate in a nation or not considering the inherent "monopoly". I aim to illustrate that since participation in a state is required for many reasons (only one of which being the simple proximity based point mentioned earlier) and since the services provided by a state have a non-zero cost, it therefore follows to pay one's taxes.

The moment ANYONE challenges bitcoin legally you can be SURE the EFF will come swarming around them in a protective shield of bees. Their reluctance to use the currency itself is simply to avoid being the target legally challenged in the first place.
EFF is more valuable to society by keeping it's nose as squeeky clean as possible so that it can truly defend and transform our rights when they are challenged.

You fundamentally misunderstand the technology. It's OK to criticise Bitcoin, and there are valid ones. But your arguments are simply ludicrous and in no way connected to the actual technology you are criticising.
By all means talk about the social aspects if you want. But you will **NEVER** be taken seriously with your argument in this thread, because you do not understand the basics of the cryptography involved. And yet you criticise it as having no basis, yet the basis is only invisible to yourself.
Please educate yourself in how the blockchain works next time you want to criticise it :)

Indeed. Any Altcoin worth it's salt would support merged mining in an attempt to gain extra security / mining power "for free". The fact that they haven't shows you it's marketed as a get rich quick opportunity for new miners that feel they "missed the boat".

But that's my point. Your logic assumes that bitcoiners have to make a conscious shared sacrifice to keep the network going which is absolutely not true. And it's a good thing too, since the game theory suggests that kind of a system would crumble.
In reality, miners are the ones selling a limited number of slots onto the network, and supply and demand dictates the fee price: not donation.

Ah yes you are correct, my apologies. Although I believe my "wait a few seconds for propagation" technique works assuming the merchant seeds the txes to well connected nodes. The attack vector is limited to the percentage of hashing power managed by clients who never heard the first transaction before the second fired on the network. Given the centralised pooling of miners today I can't imagine this takes long.

People WANT it to threaten the financial system. They WANT Bitcoin to be the alternative. Hell, Satoshi himself may have wanted this.

Read my second point: you also win if you spend bitcoins to receive the services that would have otherwise cost you your initial fiat. This is the scenario you describe: there's no transference back to dollars but if you bought $10 of Bitcoin and spend your bitcoins on $11 worth of food then you won. Until you receive those goods and services then all you have is theoretical future goods and services.
Please note that it's not a bad thing to hold (I do so myself), it's just incredibly important not to count one's chickens before they have birth certificates, especially with something so radically new like Bitcoin. If it broke tomorrow you would have lost your initial investment. 
You're still in the game until you meet the win conditions.

So your first point is laughable: if a person wanted cryptocurrency why would they need to exchange at all? Litecoin isn't going to have any uses that Bitcoin does unless this turns into a standards war which would fragment the community even further.
If you think that Litecoin would ever remain usable while Bitcoin is blocked despite them having an identical codebase then yeah, fair enough. It's a backup that's stored in the same folder and file as the original. It just sits there, taking up space on the drive without providing any redundancy.

And a 75% gain in blockchain speed is utterly inapplicable to any real life situation, offering no tangible benefit to anyone. You aren't going to wait in a shop for an average of 2.5 minutes to pay for stuff.
IMHO when you make claims like "a fraction of" when the fraction is clearly defined it just makes you look like you are trying to obfuscate the fact that 2.5 minutes isn't any more impressive than 10.
And people intentionally leave out LTC, by the way, because it offers nothing that BTC doesn't have and is solely a manufactured attempt at a second wave of wealth generation. We don't need litecoin, it offers no benefit... Why should we add complexity at this early stage of cryptocurrencies for no sane reason but some crackpot "herp a derp silver to bitcoin's gold"?

They won't stop hearing the odd Bitcoin story and they'll eventually put some effort in to learning about it themselves.

I'm none of those! While I think those kinds of people had an incentive to find bitcoin first, the rest of the world benefits from pretty instant transactions around the world, no chargebacks/reversibility (which is a benefit for retailers, but will drive adoption). It's also kind of like the WWW in that no-one owns it, which means that businesses might be compelled to use it over businesses that can change strategy.
I honestly think there's some time to go but given growth rates I think we'll get there with more services. Bitpay in particular is a company to watch for bringing this to the masses.
Legal/Tax wise, there's no difference from accepting cash payments. People will either report their incomes or they won't, and the state will act accordingly. If I ever liquidate or use my bitcoin holdings the tax man is perfectly entitled to his share in NY opinion.

Put it this way, you won't be contributing from your dad's laptop but anyone with an EC2 account or some sort of modern server in a reasonably connected location would be more than capable. Devs are working on scalability too, it's possible that there will be different tiers of peers in the future: some beefy ones with all transaction histories, and some less intelligent less demanding nodes that do grunt work and message passing.

I think some people (like myself) just have an academic interest in the search itself. The "search for Satoshi" always spotlights some interesting characters and the beauty of it is that someone's probably guessed right. We'll never have enough proof for it unless he/she/they give us it.

Big amount of money transferred around the world in about 10 minutes for about £0.02. Mention some "star power" online retailers, and when the softball questions about "but anonymity means bad stuff too!" start to show up, volley them back as gracefully and non-defensively as you can with statements like "cash is bad too", "the responsibility is with the individual" etc. And try not to sound TOO enthusiastic: this is Radio 4 we're talking about, not some Max Keiser shouty crazyness! Try to sound in your tone like bitcoins are a cool thing that you are very interested in, rather than someone who is (possibly) making large amounts of on-paper wealth through what your audience might percieve as some crazy pyramid scheme.
Also, stuff like Bitpay allows people to accept bitcoins and get cash even if they don't believe in bitcoin.
**NEVER** use the word fiat, it's just complicating your talking points and injecting an agenda for something that should be a discussion of the "mechanics and community" of bitcoin rather than the wider societal impact that only those disgruntled with the current financial system will care about. If they are listening to Radio 4 chances are they've got it pretty good in the existing system :)

While I think you clumsily identify a real issue, the problem is merely that these services are immature. This wasn't Silicon Valley where a bunch of VCs seeded a company that hired a team to build cool products. This was dudes writing PHP scripts on their spare time and falling into being the market leader of the Bitcoin world for their products!
We're in the transition period now where these services are going through their awkward growth phase. And there's still relatively little interest from traditional business, although that is changing as the US demystifies the regulatory framework.
tl;dr: melodramatic post identifying real problem that time and investment will fix.

The solution is, believe it or not, banks. The only difference is that they can be transparently audited (the address contains the same number of coins as the users' balances) and personal ownership remains a possibility. Bitcoin doesn't kill the established system at all, it just sets things up so you can "roll your own" if you want to be responsible for your own finances.
Many *don't* want to be responsible, and that's fine.

Totally unscalable. You can't propagate info on a P2P network that fast. And if you could you'd have to wait for confirmations anyway.

The very idea of where value comes from is laughable: they simply never think about it (and never have to). Money for the majority is the bank balance and coins that they own.
If we get nothing else out of Bitcoin, I hope it makes more people aware of where the value of their money comes from.

@_date: 2013-09-04 22:51:52
You don't pick an average. You pick the one that represents "dollars" vs the ones that represent "redeemable dollar tokens ^(not quite redeemable) "

Yes they are worth far less than real dollars because at this point in time they are literally worthless.

@_date: 2013-04-14 01:01:58
People want it to catch on so they can make money by taking something from 0.01 per coin to XXXX per coin. They don't want to create anything of value. They don't want to do so for any reason other than jealousy over those who got rich at bitcoin.
It is designed explicitly for this purpose, even going as far as to deliberately attempt to resist GPU Mining (which hilariously failed and was subsequently revised from history as "ASIC resistent"). They also added a useless 2.5 minute blockchain which provides no additional benefit (still useless at point of sale, which can be served adequately through systems built on bitcoin anyway).
It's more than being second to market. It's being second to market with an identical, incompatible system that offers no benefit. 
The only reason it still exists with a dollar value today is because of the greed and jealousy of it's advocates, which will come crashing down at the first major litecoin bubble "burst".

You might want to consider [Creative Commons Attribution No Derivative]( It's usually better to license things under a common format like this because it helps you have better legal protection (if you care about that) than just the legally vague wording, and it helps the internet community find and use your work without worry.

Yeah the rabid anti tax mob really doesn't gel with me either. I'll happily pay taxes on my Bitcoins, I just don't see it as a weakness of Bitcoin that it doesn't support taxes any more than over the counter cash does.

Indeed. I feel like people who are trying to compare volatility are just trying to satisfy themselves.

Forget the reliability, you'd barely get a couple of satoshis!
@_date: 2013-03-12 00:37:54
Fungability is dubious. Not only do some people value coins with particular block chain histories, there's also a fundamental difference between coins. If I try to make a spend full of satoshis from different transactions it's mostly going to get eaten up in fees compared to coins from a single address. "Dust" will always be worth less than "whole" coins because it requires less kB of block chain to process into it's destination address.
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:31:46

Thanks very much, that'll go straight to the rootkit development fund (all jokes I swear :) ). It's going to change internet security as we know it. Banks don't care, they accept hax as a cost of business and can get stuff reversed. BTC creates new challenges: how do you get average Joe/Jane to secure him/herself? The same technology that empowers us to "roll our own" opens us up to the risks of "rolling our own". Makes me think about potential future banking models that offload some of the risk/responsibility to third parties.

So what? You want to inject conflict into this very early stage of bitcoin's development? Might I remind you we've already had "the BIP wars" where LukeJR and Gavin had opposing views. How was the issue ultimately resolved? Each side presented their cases and required miners to place their votes in the blockchain.
By the time the deva announce changes they KNOW that the majority of major stakeholders are on their side. And if you are pissed about not being a major stakeholder, it's time to buy ASICs.

And your comparison is bogus. I'm no fan of the downright fanaticism that rears it's head here, but the comparison is bogus: entering or and being critical of the subject matter would likely illicit a similar response (given similar levels of activity).
Your "woe is me censored by a dumb majority" attitude is juvenile, fixes nothing, and merely serves to make the problem worse.
And why does ANYONE give two satoshis about downvotes? If you can't take criticism without the hissy for then you might want to get off the part of the internet where people freely give their opinions pseudonymously! Downvotes mean a majority of people voting dislike what you had to say. If all my posts are getting upvotes, why waste my time discussing anything?

Exactly. What else does it offer, other than a Ctrl C and Ctrl V? Ask yourself that. Bitcoin has services that accept it, Litecoin doesn't. 
Bitcoin has enough divisibility that the other scamchains aren't needed. People just created them because they got jealous and wanted to go back to the "good old days" when mining on a cpu actually got them something. Litecoin is a product of speculative greed and bitcoin jealousy, not of innovation.

I haven't downvoted you once outside of the time I explained that.
Firstly xpi/crz sideloading is of course possible, but [increasingly infeasible for the general public](
Secondly, people are downvoting you because the majority of people disagree with your viewpoints and your aggressive tone. But why do downvotes matter so much to you? That's a more interesting question. Downvotes do not matter in the slightest and many of my comments have been downvoted. So what? All that means is that the majority of people did not find my post useful. Stop treating it as though it's some heinous personal attack.

I do talk about bitcoin slightly but if a family member or friend is interested, the onus is on them to show interest. The last thing I want to be is someone "selling" the idea: even though I believe in it and will gladly describe why it's the future, I'm not a bitcoin salesman! My mother showed interest and made her own financial decision (incidentally buying at $1200 but that's typical isn't it heh). The difference is that she had genuine interest, understood the risks and is able to laugh along with me as the price plummeted because she understands her small investment and understands that the bitcoin is volatile!
I'll gladly spend my time talking economics and technology of bitcoin with anyone, but they know where to find me if they do!

If you want a Bitcoin forum to do all the work for you including justifying your investment, don't be wondering what happened if the price goes down on you. You should treat everyone in here as inherently biased (pro-bitcoin) and the quality of our advice will reflect that.
No offense but you could at least have googled some topics and come to us with questions about them (for the most part this subreddit is happy to help). But "Teach me Magic Internet Monies KThxBye" doesn't give us much to go on!

The thing is, others have answered why 10 minutes is good. But let me just point out that shortening it has little effect on bitcoin's usability. At point of sale you would need 99% of all transactions to happen within 20 seconds, say. But that includes unlucky blocks, so you'd need to lower the block time to 10 seconds. 10 second block times are ridiculously infeasible.
So consider that in most situations either 10 minutes is fine, or it is woefully inadequate (as with POS). There's no purpose pulling a Litecoin and using 2.5 min blocks because there is no use case where ~5 min payments are much more desirable than ~20 minute ones!
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:13:16

I'm pointing out fundamentals and network effects that mean a higher adoption of Litecoin dilutes growth of Bitcoin at absolutely no benefit to either. Litecoin offers nothing but a distraction that fragments cryptocurrency adoption and brings nothing to the table (unlike failed altchains like namecoin that actually attempted to innovate). At no point in these discussions do I force anyone to stop doing what they are doing. But it's not a case of "let them do their thing" because Litecoin doesn't exist in it's own bubble and would have effect on Bitcoin if adoption became significant.
Litecoin adoption is a negative sum game in the world of cryptocurrency.

@_date: 2013-03-31 15:12:11


Personally it is just a copy with nothing more, you just have to qualify the "nothing".
A faster blockchain doesn't help in any real scenarios. 2.5 minute blocks (with more uncertainty) are in no way going to facilitate different kinds of transactions to 10 minute blocks. If you could pull off 10 second blocks (NOTE: This is ridiculously unviable) then **maybe** it'd be interesting for point of sale.
The different hashing is a silly idea of making things "equal" for miners. Whomever made litecoin wanted to stop GPU miners from having control, so they put in a memory hard hash instead of the SHA256 hash. But then of course it transpired that people can do this on GPUs, so they rebranded it to be ASIC resistent.
In reality the more dedicated miners like ASICs result in a safer block chain because in the Litecoin world, someone could build a really expensive but functional FPGA or ASIC at some point and completely take over the market. The artificial limits that Litecoin imposes on mining growth due to the mistaken notion of 'fairness' ultimately cripple miners' ability to secure that blockchain as effectively as Bitcoin's.
So yeah my TL;DR is that Litecoins were created because of mining jealousy, and are being perpetuated by speculator jealousy and greed. Litecoin offers nothing fundamental that is of any value to a merchant or customer, and would actively add to costs where merchants must support competing identical standards.
People want alternative blockchains to succeed for some legitimate purposes, and attach to litecoin in the mistaken belief that Litecoins offer something different. But for the most part, Litecoins just exist because a handful of people 'missed the boat' and wanted to create an alternative pump and dump scheme.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:20:21
This is going to sound facetitious, but do you have a secure decentralised solution to the double spend, transaction validation and initial seeding problems that Bitcoin's mining resolves? Because that's what any replacement would need to do.
Bitcoin's "waste" is very little, especially when compared to things like standard high street distribution channels, plastic cards and the like. The humble SHA256 hash is 'useless' in itself but Bitcoin is constructed out of this primitive, and is inherently useful. It's simply impossible to strap BOINC or anything else in there and maintain bitcoin's decentralised nature.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:37:15
It's a small cabal of mining users who miss the "good old days" trying to convince the rest of the world that their CPU cycles are worth anything.
Bitcoin's value is derived from the new and interesting technology that allows new things to happen (instant worldwide transfer, anonymity, decentralisation/resilience,  low fees). Incumbents MUST match this benchmark AND offer something else (or match some of the benchmark and a LOT else... You get the idea).
The forks offer nothing as I've outlined in other posts here. Faster transactions is an academic triviality that provides no real world benefits, and the mining algorithm serves only to weaken an individual's input into the blockchain which increases the reward for any entity with the resources to throw at expensive  custom hardware for a memory hard problem. Recall that the target of LTC hashing has already been revised from "GPU resistant" as people made it happen.
Caveat emptor.
PS: I agree zerocoin was an interesting proposal. However for the sake of clarity (for those reading) zerocoin described a protocol level "accounting trick" of sorts to create more anonymity rather than a true altcoin. Namecoin had potential but would never have achieved critical mass and wasn't scalable. It's the closest we've come to seeing a derivative with new ideas though (outside of exotic economic experiments with things like demurrage that are cool to see but completely antithetical to the individual game theory of holding virtual currency.
@_date: 2013-11-13 09:50:22
It will always be less economical to do this than devote the CPU resources to mining: the chance of finding an existing key is infinitesimal.
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:52:27
It's not valid competition. A separate cryptographic system or a system with some different intrinsic properties would offer significant real value. Your statement however just reframes the word 'speculation' in a positive angle (as in it exists because people speculate notBitcoins will have value).
It's perfectly valid of course as a thing to speculate on: if you can buy and sell it it exists, right? I just want to make clear to a lot of people who may otherwise get sucked into the hype of 'Bitcoin2' that this isn't really going to behave the same way. People don't need altcoins unless they offer something different, and the block speed/crypto changes offer absolutely nothing of real value.
@_date: 2013-03-11 20:21:28
The market is a shorthand for yourself and myself. I'm doing my thing and you are doing yours: thse all encomapass "the market". What I WILL do (and always will) is dissuade use of Litecoin for the many stated reasons simply because if by some miracle litecoin succeeds it serves only to dilute Bitcoin's success and make implementation of cryptocurrency for merchants harder as they have to implement two competing standards, each ultimately requiring an "always on" secure server to exist somewhere and also require expansion of source code to support the new blockchain, despite it being like having "cents" and "dollars" as two completely seperate primitives interchangeable only at specialised exchanges.
So yes, I'll let the markets decide. I have no choice in that in fact, it's the beauty of cryptocurrency. But my input **is** a piece that market deciding.

Disclaimer: just my opinion. No basis in fact or research.
Over 4k, and with more mainstream acceptance. Silicon valley sniffing around and diving in even more. Regulatory frameworks demystified in more countries. Services like Bitpay prosper, and merchants want to "take our money" even if they don't believe in the currency. More theft, more darknet shadiness. More than one big rally/correction.
We won't have ironed out the wrinkles in both software implementation and mainstream acceptance, but we'll be better than we are now. The media will continue enjoying their page views writing about it.

And I believe Bitcoin **WILL** shake up these institutions, just as the Internet shook up the technology world. But it won't radically reform them and anyone who thinks that there's a big ol' reset switch on the global financial system is drastically underestimating the difficulty of that happening.
By the way I've been actively involved since the sub dollar parity days, and my main motivation was a deep interest in the crypto. So don't go assuming I'm some post-bubble  daytrader with no real understanding of the goals and potential of Bitcoin. I just see a more realistic endgame for Bitcoin than total world domination and some anarchistic dream about devolving all power to "the people". 
It will change the system for the better. It will not and cannot break it.

What I object to is the **same** cryptocurrency coming along, getting a new lick of paint and then trying to pass itself off as something new. I've said many a time that I would embrace any new technology.
A 300% increase in speed (not 400%) would not confer any singificant benefits. People are always going to want to move their money a little bit faster when daytrading, but they'll say the same thing when they get an unlucky Litecoin block that takes 5 minutes. Litecoin doesn't funamentally solve this problem at all, it just creates the illusion of doing so. It's much as it was "so hard" to mine on a GPU: Litecoin offered nothing but a momentary roadblock and people "solved" the problem, shattering Litecoin's dubious claims of "fairness". Bitcoin's speed is adequate, and to iterate on that you would need to be orders of magnitude faster, not just four times.

It truly is the same in any specialised subreddit though. Gaming ones are the worst honestly, so many whining fanboys (who couldn't possibly be so upset by the sheer injustices of game developer decisions to stop playing the games, *oh no...*)
Treat the subreddit as the biased echo chamber that it is, and contrast what it says with other sources. Just ease of the Max Keiser if possible, that's a bit too far for my tastes :)

It matters less until it's above 50%. You are right of course, but the fact that miners delegate their voting rights to their representatives allows the representatives to do bad things before the voters move elsewhere. It's much akin to RL voting where the voters are powerless in the years between elections.

Transaction confirmation speed is literally useless in the real world (unless it's sub 20 seconds in &gt;95% of cases it isn't usable in real world point-of-sale scenarios). People forget Bitcoin is the backbone: faster transaction processing and propagation is already possible through third party underwriting and bitcoin's scripting syntax allows for true decentralised approaches to this problem to be added later.
ASIC resistant algorithms are broken in the sense that it is only a matter of time before an entity gains enough knowledge and computational power to subvert what is a completely arbitrary barrier. 
ASIC adoption by miners is currently immature, but we are FAR better for having ASICs when it comes to truly guaranteeing the network's resilience. Any attempt to subvert natural economy of scale and optimisation whilst still using a proof of work system is fighting a losing battle by definition: indeed the makers of Litecoin not a of stealthily revised their goal of being "GPU resistant" to being "ASIC resistant" once people figured out how to use GPUs for Litecoin mining. 
If people have an interest in Litecoin I have no problem with it. But I have a major problem when people try to peddle it's non-existent advantages that sound good on impulse but upon reflection offer zero benefit to users.

Yeah let's equate what I'm saying to more completely irrelevant stuff to attempt some sort of crazy ad hominem. 
I'm British by the way, but I'll play along with your silly metaphor and try and twist the scenario into it: the purposes of you splitting up from good old blighty was by definition because you thought being independent conferred significant advantages. Not because you thought it would be cool having your own government, but because your fork offered things like less taxes etc. As I repeatedly state Litecoin offers nothing, it'd be like me saying that Newcastle-Upon-Tyne should be it's own country just because, while offering the exact same legal ruleset and governmental structure. The only ones getting excited there would be those who wish to apply for new governmental positions of power in the pointless country.

The 51% "attack" is more of a "51% vote". We would do well to consider this, especially when we cede our voting rights to pool managers. To only point at which this natural and elegant consensus-making process becomes troublesome is if it is in the hands of too few people.

We're in the very early days my friend. Bitcoin has to prove it has relatively stable value before people can start to produce "unpegged transactions" that don't link up to USD directly.
Have a look at what CCP Games did in the Icelandic Banking Crisis though. They offered to pay in Dollars, the more stable of the two currency options. The same could happen for Bitcoin in the future.
Once businesses start accepting bitcoins more and more it makes more sense to pay debts in Bitcoin to avoid conversion fees/uncertainty.

Devcoin is a lame attempt at desperately getting people to do the creator's work for them. Freicoin offers a feature that actively harms adoption, as if these dime a dozen blockchains needed any more reason to fade into irrelevance.
Demurrage is an 'interesting' concept academically, but why the hell would anyone choose to own a depreciating asset over an appreciating one? Lime it or not we're "stuck" with the deflation model because it provides the greatest benefit to the investors you need for these blockchains to scatter the coins enough and add scarcity. Without a viable market it's just a tech demo and a means for savvy miners to make money through Vircurex Altcoin Arbitrage whenever people stupidly gamble on these things.

He's referring to the technical definitions. A crash is a well defined event that is measurable (price decrease of X in time Y). A recovery is not well defined because who is to say it isn't transient? You have to wait a period to gain reasonable confidence in the "recovered" price.

Well congratulations on assuming I'm some kind of troll, but perhaps I should clarify why this post is so odd.
There are three things this post could be asking for:
* Generic Motivational Stuff
In which case, why involve bitcoin at all? 
* Bitcoin specific stuff in the bible
The most perplexing thing. Even the most pious amongst us would not expect biblical references to new technology. 
* Finance specific stuff in the bible
Perhaps OP wanted to know if Christianity had covered topics like deflation. But this is a huge stretch on my part and there's no evidence to support this. And again, generic biblical coverage of finance has little to do with bitcoin.
But do continue to mock my overly terse reply. I enjoy capital letters.

They can very easily if someone underwrites the risk of a 0 confirmation transaction. That seems very viable for a "first person buying goods" scenario: how likely are they to have access to miners that they can program to reject a block in 10 minutes, then get lucky at solving said block?!? Even if 1/100 customers were a scumbag with access to a massive mining array that just happened to solve the right block, I think it's pretty safe to sell goods on 0 confirmations compared to Credit Card processing fees.


Without loans, true economy is impossible. They are in use for thousands of years, debt is not a modern invention.
People here suggest that complete replacement of Fiat is the end game. I am not so sure. But despite that the idea that loans are impossible and that this is a stable of an economy remains a topic of discussion between Austrian and Keynesian economics.

Yes but reading the spec, issuance of Mastercoins is clearly the primary motivator for a lot of the attention, when




and finally


These are all the hallmarks of fly-by-night junkcoins, and the addition of "developer reward" coins is antithetical to decentralization. An adversary merely has to gain control of the exodus address to be completely in charge of Quantively Easing and distributing currency as he or she feels compelled to. This is particularly damaging because it is built into the protocol, rather than being based around premining, which at least limits the scope of said control.

Just be careful with software obviously. It'd such to mess stuff up and lose money because of user error.

It is just a software project. And forking anything makes no sense without a userbase.

The point of this entire debate however is that ASICs are always possible. If Bitcoin is truly going to be so valuable people WILL find a way to make raw silicon do SHA256 hashing. Obfuscating this just buys time until someone makes either a discovery or an unusually large investment.
Such instability as you highlight is a product if the short term. As people buy into the idea of Bitcoin this will change, especially as ASIC manufacturers become more trustworthy and as ASIC performance approaches it's limit (which will be quite soon).
I'd much rather get this out of the way now, since if Litecoin were the dominant cryptocurrency any nation state could invest in a single project and gain massive share of the network, compared to BTC where a nation state could only build efficient, cost effective ASIC farms using pretty much the same order of magnitude of W/Ghash

That's like complaining about the block size limit, or about how current transaction fees would be expensive in 2080. Those are set today and WILL be changed: they do NOT represent a fundamental flaw with Bitcoin. The fact that they are "hard" to change is merely a function of the decentralized nature of the protocol, and of how full nodes and miners have "voting rights" throughout this process.

Well for example let's say they embed child pornography images to the blockchain. It's arguably no different from your machine passing encrypted blobs around (Tor?) and without you actively trying to parse the block as an image it's not like you can be said to have "downloaded" such material. It would create negative press though, and is an interesting thought experiment.
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:10:05
Yes, because not using terms that the general public associate with criminals is TOTALLY a corruption of the truth. Because a "hacker" is your sense is COMPLETELY different from a software developer now isn't it?
Oh wait no this is earth calling, turns out people get confused by ambiguous terminology with it's own stigma attached and that using an equivalent word better allows explanation of the Bitcoin concepts so people can make up their own minds. Who'da thunk it...

Agreed. If it becomes a gold-like store of value only then it would be somewhat disappointing, but hardly "failure"!
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:35:56
You completely misunderstand: people use bitcoin to buy "mundane" things all the time. There are many reasons like convenience, low fees for consumer, no charge backs etc for retailer (leading to cheaper prices). Why do you think bitpay is becoming such a large entity?

The blockchain CAN be updated if the majority of clients port over to the new encryption scheme. It requires the majority to trust the devs and upgrade stuff though.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:03:56
Triggering it isn't the issue. Repeatedly uploading new images to the CSS uploader and heavily hammering reddit is the issue. I'm pretty sure updating that single image would invalidate the entire set of images (and possibly the CSS) across all of caches, which could put a lot more load on them as every user needs the new version (and reddit has to update all of their CDN stuff for every update)
Without an API you'd have to write something that navigates to those pages too, which isn't impossible but it's non-trivial, even with things like a ruby gem called Capybara-mechanize...
tl;dr Interesting idea, thinking out loud, probably hard to do and against reddit TOS

Hilarious that they recommend not paying the fee while doing so themselves. How does a government agency not have backups, anyway?

Security of Infrastructure. I fear a chicken and egg scenario where enough investment/expertise doesn't make it to sites and services resulting in more attacks and a lack of confidence. It would relegate Bitcoin to "store of value" or worse as no one would dare transact in it, and it would remain a niche as it would be unable to get wider appeal if perceived as such a target.

Risk of losing $10 to a customer who then double spends the coins? Low. POS businesses could eat the cost of fraudulent transactions as they are forced to now with counterfeit coins and notes, or they could handle payments through third parties that underwrite the risk for a small fee. Providing the transaction makes the blockchain it's an instant payment, the waiting period is just a verification step.

Who would buy those domain names given that they are 
* Centred around a subreddit meme that already has several websites devoted to it
* Have many alternative variants of ge meme that can be used (anything moon related would work for these kinds of sites)

Well bitcointalk was still on bitcoin.org back then. But I'm pretty sure I remember someone else setting up the forum for him (one of the early devs, but I can't remember the name!). Sorry it's so vague but I think that's user 2.
