I picture you logging into your bank's website, clicking the button to transfer money to your electric company, and silently pointing at your T-shirt. A single tear forms on your face.

The Andresen link is really good! Agree with your last sentence completely.

Excellent post. People need to read coelomate's post a few times. The weird thing about TA is that novice investors hear about it and it seems almost magical. The idea that you can just look at a chart, with no other information, is very appealing. And because a lot of people talk about it (and there is a huge industry behind it), a lot of novices just assume it's valid and works.
So much of TA is just accepted wisdom, survivor bias and confirmation bias. If you have 1000 people in a coin-flipping contest, someone is going to win, and of course no rational person would say "Oh, they have a real coin tossing skill!". When hundreds of thousands of investors make their (essentially binary) decisions based on TA, a certain amount are of course going to come out on top, and the thing is, they are positive that their analysis was valid, because they got it right 8 times in a row. The people who get it wrong 8 times in a row will quit because they're broke, or quit because they're discouraged, etc., and they won't be the ones making a huge noise about how great TA is. 
There is a massive industry related to TA Books, training courses, video training, and of course the massive amounts of trading that TA believers bring to the market (along with all. those. fees.) and the people profiting from it are of course going to encourage it, but when it comes down to it, there really isn't MUCH evidence that it's very valid.

That makes sense, but it does seem like it defeats the purpose of having a brain wallet to begin with, the simplicity stuff. But it's a good idea, I may do it!

I had mine saved in a text file on my laptop, so I got lucky. There's probably an email reminder function though if you still have the email addy you signed up with?

Which ones? Can you report back when you receive them on how good they are? I'm on the fence right now.

It's pretty hard to believe you bought and sold at the recent high and low prices, and you said you were doing arbitrage, but then describe day trading. Would like to know what process you used to actually buy 6 figures of Bitcoin, which isn't an easy thing to do logistically.

It's just a little joke cause of the constant "I found all sorts of bitcoins from a year ago!" threads/stories.
