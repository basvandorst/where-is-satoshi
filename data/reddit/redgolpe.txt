Thank you for the information you provided. I suggest you start learning about cold storages before giving random security advices though.
And yes, bitcoin is all about being in control of my money, which in my mind also implies that transactions should be irreversible.
Also, of course I use PayPal. Do you think I'm better off paying 5 USD every time in fees? That's why I'm waiting for LN, but I would also like to understand how it works before blinding using it "because it's better".

Guys, what's the problem with Warren? He's a pretty good investor, who just stated the obvious. Bitcoin will, eventually, become obsolete, it's just unavoidable. And if it does after reaching, say, 1,000,000 USD per btc, he'll be right anyway: I guess he's *already* pissed off for not having bought at 1 USD (or... did he?), but that's another story.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:20:42
Implementing segwit has a cost, especially for big exchanges who need to be sure they don't compromise their security. They are probably waiting to see if smaller merchants adoption give at least a modestly appreciable result, which at the moment doesn't seem to be the case, though adoption is already over 10%.
That said, my preferred exchange Bitstamp adopted segwit like 3 months ago and most big operators are following suit, AFAICT. I'm not even sure who we are talking about when we complain about lack of adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:52:08

And now that fees are super low, they are only 10 times higher than Bitcoin Cash, in currency, without even factoring the fact that one Bitcoin is worth 7 Bitcoin Cash, which would make them 70 times higher in fiat.

I repeat, in what dream of yours did he say anything about Bitcoin (core)? How can you claim that he supported the core or the cash version during the August 1 fork?
He was just stating that the page displayed on bitcoin.com had nothing to do **with bitcoin**, which on the other hand, **currently does**.
So, again, what is the point of this 9-old-year comment, referring to a completely different web page?

If you imported a private key in electrum and it does NOT show the correct address, that simply isn't the private key for that address. If it uses two or more private keys, it's a multisig address which I don't think is your case (but may be wrong).
If all else fails, I suggest you make a new address and send your funds from your (hopefully) working armory wallet to it.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:51:27


No, I can't. And unless you are a very skilled programmer, neither do you.


I'd settle for months-in-development ones. Not 4 years.


What do you think anyone uses for payments today? A broken system with 5 USD fees per transaction? If you want your revolution, I'm fine, but I'm not going to pay for it.

which may just be the starting BTC if Alice had malicious intents from the start.
Anyway, the more I learn about LN the more it becomes interesting.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:59:10
Blocks come actually faster than the average of 10 minutes because hash rate is constantly increasing. Only with the past 3 adjustments hash rate has increased 43%.
**Edit:** technically it's difficulty which increased 43%, which is a measure of how much hash rate (which is unknown) is estimated to increase.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:56:11


The huge losses they'd incur to attempt that. If you buy at, say, 15'000 USD and sell to 0.01, you get around 7'500 USD loss per BTC. If you wish to try it now, you'd probably need around 2 million BTC to crash the market over the course of a couple of days. That would cost you around 15 **billion** dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:03:01
Thanks for this explanation, care to elaborate more?
So let's say Bob and Alice open a channel with a transaction with a sufficient fee. There is nothing on the blockchain for 3 days? Can Bob just close the channel to make the transaction(s) appear? Or is that delayed too? If i get it right, basically a LN channel is a single transaction, which keeps updating continuously (as long as Alice and Bob keep exchanging funds, or actually not even necessarily so), is that correct? What's the 3-days story again? Doesn't the channel stay indefinitely open until Bob or Alice decide to close it?
@_date: 2018-01-02 11:55:08


I can live with that, but it sounds unsafe as hell.

Coinbase may be an issue, but they say [they are working on it]( Bitpay has, what, 0.8% of the market? Anyway, they seem to be [working on it]( too. Most of the largest merchants seem to be have already adopted it (or working on it), it looks to me that the lack of adoption is more the average user's fault. Which on the other hand seems perfectly reasonable, as by far the most used client doesn't yet create segwit addresses by default.
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:53:42
This happens all the time, and there's not much to worry about. The problem is **between Kraken's receiving bank and Kraken** so that's not much either you or they can do except trying to speed up things with said bank.
Though all similar cases I'm aware of have resolved successfully in about a couple months, I also suggest to avoid such large transfer in a single operation.

Why so? It looks perfectly obvious to me that central hubs will be needed, or the whole point of LN fails. If you just keep opening channels with all your friends, it's simply more costly than just paying for the transaction itself. A hub solves this problem if all friends are connected to the hub.
Also, if you wish to motivate your "it is complete fraud" statement, maybe you might also get some upvotes.

The last one. That means I have to backup every single transaction I do.


My mistake. "Ledger forging" is probably a better term.


I disagree. If they lose their backup, their money is lost. If they lose their LN transactions, malicious actors may be able to get their funds back. While we all honest people would remain at a loss.

Huh? Jut look at a price chart.


It's called Christmas, in case you didn't notice.


Adjustments have a very limited effect on the BCH chain because, contrary to the BTC one, they're real-time. So a modest 15% increase like the next one is projected to be won't have any practical effect.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:25:54


You are. You seem to imply that BTC is somehow satoshi's preferred choice over BCH.


No, but it has gained momentum after the fork, to distinguish it from bitcoin cash. Before the fork, almost everyone referred to it as just bitcoin. That also implies that after the fork, you can't just use "bitcoin" to refer to core, or to cash, since both visions arose from the former bitcoin.
And yes, since your Nissan comment is totally irrelevant, as obviously that website has nothing to do with Nissan, just as the website satoshi was talking about 9 years ago had nothing to do with bitcoin, I am ignoring it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:24:14

@_date: 2018-01-02 16:19:03
Yes, yes, of course, I understand how to backup something. I don't think having a backup of a LN transaction might pose particular difficulties.
However, one thing is to backup your finite set of private keys, another one is backup every single transaction you make (potentially infinite).
But what really concerns me is the market value of a coin based on this. Let's say I know how to backup every single transaction I make. I can live with that, actually. Now imagine for a moment that some important institution (say, an exchange) collapses (think a power outage, or a big hack). After a while, it becomes clear (and public knowledge) that all LN transactions have just vanished. What prevents people to start broadcasting the older channel status? I see room for magical money printing here, and this doesn't look like a great scenario for the future of a coin, does it? I know people can say "but you'll lose all the money you put in the channel if caught". First, this idea that people always put thousands of btc in their newly-open channels looks simply ridiculous to me; second, it is a prerequisite of the scenario that you actually know that your partner have collapsed, feel free to make up a new scenario if you want :)
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:28:00


And what can prevent that? Did someone register the "bitcoin" name? Last time I checked, the technology was open source. And last time I checked, yes, Bitcoin Cash is telling Core to change their name, so it seems it's working exactly that way.


I'm afraid I miss the connection with The Donald.

No, I'm not. I don't count domains changing hands as a hobby. Feel free to do your research if you're interested though.


In what dream of yours did he say anything about Bitcoin core? Because that term wasn't even in use 9 years ago. He was just noticing that address pointed to a website (which you can see [here]( which had nothing to do with Bitcoin. The current one, on the other hand, was purchased by its current owner Roger Ver in 2015, IIRC, and is all about Bitcoin, maybe not in the same terms you would do, but that's not what satoshi pointed out, nor we know what satoshi's opinion is, or would be, about the fork.

There is not enough information in your post to understand what's going on but I'll try to help with general ideas:
* Any normal *wallet* is just a collection of *private keys*. A private key is always a 64-character hexadecimal string (i.e., you will only see 0-9 and A-E characters). If you wish to create a normal wallet in Electrum, you should use those keys. You can even use only one, and you will have a single-address wallet, which is perfectly legit (though you *might* want to use more if you are concerned with privacy).
* To a *private key* corresponds one and only one *address*. An address is a 26 to 35-character string, with numbers and uppercase and lowercase letters. It always starts with 1 or 3. Your addresses probably start with 1. You can use these addresses to create a watch-only wallet. If you succeeded, your addresses are right. You just need to retrieve the private keys for those addresses.
* A *seed* is a collection of characters or words you use to reconstruct a wallet. You should **not** use your seed to create a normal wallet in Electrum, even if that is possible, because you don't know exactly how the seed creates the wallet, unless this is explicitly stated.
Feel free to ask for more help if the above was already clear (in which case the term "noob" does not apply to you).

I know that part, but you still have to open a channel. Say i want to buy a game from Steam (which I can't do anymore, but let's say). I may already have a channel open with, say, Kraken. If I find a Steam customer with an open channel with both Kraken and Steam I can use them as a "hop", but I still need to open a channel with them.
I see this working very well (dramatically actually) when adoption rises by a couple order of magnitudes, but until I am the only one in my circle of friends working with bitcoin, that doesn't seem to provide much relief.

What I find most frightening is the absolute faith in the Lightning Network. If I look at my past transactions, it's rare I've done more than a couple of them with the same merchant (except perhaps exchanges), and I still can't figure out how LN can help in this situation.
LN seems perfect for actors who work together on a regular basis with several transactions a period (hour? day?) but I couldn't even figure out one such example.
Not to mention that in the past 5 years LN has regularly won the prize for "Next year's best innovation".

They released some binaries before the source code to allow a limited number of "trusted" nodes to apply the patch. That's obviously to avoid spreading information about the fixed bugs, thus preventing malicious attacks like the couple we've already seen while giving enough time to the nodes to upgrade. During this phase, everyone is obviously free to decide NOT to install the (intrinsecally untrusted) software.
After that, they release the source code and the software is open source again. This is actually what most open source companies often do, Open Office comes to mind as an example.
All of the above is clearly and plainly stated in [the post]( currently at the top of the sub.

No, absolutely. You really see conspirators everywhere. I just noticed that now the discussion can move to "are they legally bound to exchange USDT for USD?" to "are they going to survive?"
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:23:32
I've done that for a while but unfortunately there is a third party involved in the payments which charges outrageous fees "for network usage" (what does that even mean?), like 3-4 USD, plus the fee for the transaction of course. Though I'm all for extensive adoption, it's honestly too much for my average 15 USD game so I reverted back to cash.
Frankly, if Bitcoin's first aim is to cut the man in the middle, this makes very little sense.

Easy solution: HODL both.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:09:51
I see. So you consider ATH a value when it stays there for? 1 hour? 1 day? I do believe your definition is different from the majority but it's a definition so you can say whatever you like, I'm not going to argue with that.

I am not even sure what you're talking about. Hash rate seems [completely stable]( as it has always been since the BCH upgrade that removed the 2-week period adjustment. So what's the problem? BCH is rising? Well, just offer a better value and then let the market decide.

@_date: 2017-11-20 10:08:32
I still don't get it. Why would one convert to USDT instead of USD if it's 1:1?
Also, [legal terms]( on the Tether website say:


Which makes me wonder about the 1:1 thing altogether. It looks to me just like another altcoin. Also,


Isn't that pretty much the definition of a cryptocurrency?

So is it even possible to trade tether for USD? If not, what's the whole point again?
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:42:14
HODL never meant "HODL and starve". I always read it as "HODL all savings, use the rest for a living", and that's what I did. I even managed to see some places around the world I couldn't have if not for Bitcoin, and I'm 100% sure I won't ever regret to have sold some for those experiences.

Yeah, it's much more efficient with 28 billion, I understand, I'll let out the user base for the moment because no one really knows and your guess is as good as mine. So, you say that with a market cap of 28 billion, BTC would be able to manipulate the market just as easily. Fine that, but isn't that just a little less than BTC's market cap at the time of the fork? Why didn't BTC do that at the time, so to wipe out BCH instantly, and for good, before all this even started? This, frankly I don't get.

If we indeed hit the top in 2019 (as 2019 can't be higher than 3300) and we are following a gaussian curve as your table suggest, I expect 2020 to be a little higher than 2017, so around 800.

10% is a correction.
20% is a strong correction.
30% is a stronger correction.
40% is a dip. You can buy here.
50% is a deep dip. If you did not buy at 40%, and if you DID buy at 40%, buy more.
60% is a bubble pop. You can safely assume that you're closer to zero than to ATH. A good reason to buy.
70% is a sale. Bitcoin at less than one third of their price? Come on...
80% is a Black Friday. It might not even be Friday, but who cares?
90% is a crash. It would make BTC price the same as it was 7 months ago, when you said the bubble was about to pop and it was too expensive to get into anyway. If you bough at 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% and 80%, do you see any good reason to NOT buy more?
100% is technically impossible. By this time Bitcoin would have probably bounced and marked another ATH. Time to HODL your cheap coins and start again.

That's not the point, you had a great idea, especially for the kind of business you run: most people, you'll see them once and then never again, so it's an amazing potential source of new adopters. Also, the target is perfect because of the correlation of relatively high income (and thus potential room for investment) and plane travelling.

Yes it would. In practice, mining will go on forever, even if no more bitcoins are generated, with fees as reward.
If you just decide to stop counting arbitrarily at 1 satoshi, and not consider the following epochs where the reward is 0 satoshi (which might also as well become 0.5 satoshis if rules are changed in the next decades), then sure, you only have a finite time to mine all "available" satoshis.

Anyone can see this is a scam: they pay 6000% (that is 61 times) after two days when the compound interest on the 1-day 700% (8 times) for 2 days amounts to 6300% (64 times). Well orchestrated, because the 70000% (701 times) in 3 days seems perfectly legit, as the single-day compound investment would only yield 51100% (512 times).

Guys, it's easy: the biggest pools opposing BIP 91 atm are bitcoin.com, F2Pool and slush.

You should not be over concerned with that as most exchanges are talking about waiting 6*(BTC:BCC hashpower ratio) confirmations before confirming a deposit (in BCH, if you are talkinc BTC there should be no delay). That will probably mean 30-60 blocks, which will amount to several days before the new difficulty kicks in. Basically, there will be no such thing as "too fast".

Sorry, I get it now. Your best bet is to wait until you have evidence that the first block has been mined on the new blockchain. I have no idea if a blockchain explorer already exists for the new chain, so your best bet is to install a BCH-compatible wallet and take note when the blocks start to diverge. I am also pretty sure that will erupt when it happens, so it should be pretty hard to miss.

@_date: 2017-07-31 20:11:28
In detail, I'd start [here]( Short version:
* (optional) consolidate your bitcoins **before** the fork into a single address to avoid headache;
* (optional) after the fork, move your bitcoins to a new address to avoid unlikely but possible [replay attacks]( the usual way;
* export all your private keys (only one if you've done the first point) to a [wallet supporting BCC](
At this point you have two wallets, one with your bitcoins and one with the same amount of BCC. Feel free to do with your BCC what you see fit: exchange them for BTC, fiat or just hodl them.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:05:10
 (only one with an explicit percentage based on block period)

 (probably started counting one block later)
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:31:30


There is no such thing as "wallet.dat compatibility". Your wallet.dat only contains a certain number of addresses with their private keys, which in turn contain some outputs (these are stored in the blockchain, not in your wallet). You should, one way or the other, export those keys and import them into a wallet (I know Bitcoin-qt uses a [command-line console]( to do that). I have no idea if any of those wallets allow import of the wallet.dat file out of the box.


You are not, but you can check their code as it is open source. If you can't do that, I suspect that you were not able to check Bitcoin-qt's code as well in the first place so you just have to decide if you trust BitcoinABC at least as much as you trusted Bitcoin-qt.
