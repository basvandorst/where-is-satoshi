It doesn't looks like it's bitfinex coins, probably more an early adopter wanting to have some fun or just to see the community reaction.
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:55:41
I don't think 1000 BTC will get you a house on the beach right now, but it would still be a nice one !
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:25:14
In [this]( article on bloomberg, they  say that they "are leaning towards a socialized loss scenario among bitcoin balances and active loans to BTCUSD positions”. So if he just had cash sitting on his account, it should be fine.
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:08:05
Hey, if you had your assets in dollars you shouldn't be too impacted according to what they said
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:49:38
I don't usually participate in that kind of thing, but why the hell not ?
@_date: 2016-04-04 14:56:34
Except that this article is bullshit, what the IMF is saying is that the EU and Germany won't do shit to save Greece unless there IS a credit event (which is pretty true, the EU doesn't move unless there is a crisis). They aren't plotting to provoke one.
@_date: 2016-04-04 18:02:22
I think the EU is another person in the house, with the "this is fine" look on his face, and not allowing firefighters inside.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:54:12
The issue isn't cloudfare, it's kraken servers shitting the bed every time they have some load. It's getting pretty infuriating really.
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:32:03
Oh, didn't noticed it, thank you very much :p
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:40:53
There is no real source for that, but just look at it; they select random peoples, do not require education or nothing. Given the cost, you would think that the peoples they would send would be engineers or scientist.
@_date: 2014-01-08 10:11:19
I already got Reus, so if anyone want it, let me know
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:17:36
I buy suff through gyft 1-2 times a month, I need a french online store for everyday stuff that directly accept bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-08 20:57:50
then you are not the target. There is a reason why they aren't targeting genius scientist ; they wouldn't bite to that stuff
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:11:45
They are not selling the travel, the selling of the merchandise is to finance the travel of the selected individuals, if it happen.
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:26:02
Mhh, didn't saw that. Yep, i'm sure that it's a scam now.
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:34:03
It's not possible, all the exchange are subject to the Know Your Customer Act, against money laundering. I've been thinking for a while on how to get around that, and there is quite no way.
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:50:59
Guys, mars one is a scam, peoples on mars will not happen with that company.
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:39:59
For now they are selling [things]( on their website and collecting money on indigogo. Their official goal is to send a bunch of people for a one way trip to mars.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:47:23
Please remember that the ID required is required by anti Thrust and money laundering laws, that are quite international (even Sweden-based exchange need to apply that)
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:52:48
The future will tell us I guess
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:05:37
For science, whatever you want, to support the project, etc.
The point is, they will probably not use the money to go to mars
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:10:03
The goal is not outrageous, the company is. they don't have any plan, no vessel, didn't send anything in space yet, and how can anyone think that someone can go to mars with 400.000 $ ? Oh, i'm sure that man on mars will happen, but i am almost sure that Mars One is a scam.
@_date: 2016-03-29 18:31:52
And there is a problem with a currency being vulnerable to spam.
@_date: 2016-03-29 20:15:25
Well it doesn't kills it, but it means you need to pay more in fees.
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:10:50
Nice idea to hide a few coins, put a stash in the middle of the ocean.
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:59:22
It's just meant so peoples don't purchase at all on the internet
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:51:41
Hopefully their expansion in the US will bring more people to trade in dollars on the site.
@_date: 2016-03-23 13:20:51
Well there is only the wallet page so yeah it's probably that.
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:39:23
Nicely explained, thanks.
@_date: 2016-06-04 20:58:50
Makes sense, I only watched the implosion part happen.
@_date: 2016-06-04 13:27:19
Oh, it didn't make sense for me that bitcoin price where higher while you couldn't withdraw, if you can't withdraw fiat and bitcoin, then yeah I can see that happening.
@_date: 2016-06-15 10:50:37
Contact the bitmixer staff, they should be able to double spend it with a higher fee.
@_date: 2016-06-08 23:17:09
Why not both ?
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:15:47
Yeah I've been having the same, their status page still says everything is okay. I guess a lot of people are panic selling with the current drop.
@_date: 2016-06-28 12:55:35
Nope, the US just likes a stable supply for the market, keeps price stable.
@_date: 2017-08-28 07:58:51
Yeah you would only pay more fees if they did.
@_date: 2016-06-17 11:43:23
Well it did cash a bit today but nothing that dramatic.
@_date: 2016-06-04 13:00:37
Above or bellow ?
@_date: 2016-06-28 13:03:52
Know your customer and anti money laundering laws, exchanges and banks are required to get and verify your identity, and provide signal any suspect transaction to the authorities.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:10:31
There is a segwit party for [Paris]( too !
@_date: 2016-11-02 17:52:44
Meh, old people are still likely to fall for that shit, doesn't make them not worth saving.
@_date: 2016-06-08 16:43:44
Well if the price rise, it makes sense to buy btc now to pay when needed
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:15:47
You should use veracrypt, which is still supported.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:23:33
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:48:11
Well I say wait and see, I am just less worried than when people were hyping up a tweet from a brand new Twitter account.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:43:24
Let's see if it's not a scam first, it's literally their first tweets.
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:39:50
Hi, let me explain to you why my ICO isn't garbage and will make you millions
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:46:32
What's the issue with kraken ?
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:31:54
At this point this sub just post any tweet that comfort it's ideas, it's kind of shitty.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:35:50
Dude is going to be a marathon runner.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:55:25
So they are not nobodies after all, good to see some competition there.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:59:11
Yeah he's being quite an hypocrite, he wants people to use the name he chose but refuses to use one that has been used for quite a long time now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:48:36
I remember the electrum team tweeting a how to using [electron cash]( but I can't find the link anymore. Careful when using it though it copies your private keys. So do a backup of your wallet first, and create a new wallet for your bitcoins right after.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:43:13
This is  Shaun Bridges, the guy who stole the Silk Road funds and already got some time for it.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:42:28
Yeah I don't mind tweets by core devs or big figures on something important, but most of them are just randoms going with the circlejerk of the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:25:08
It surely made Mark Karpeles slimmer.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:25:23
I mean every sub that's focused on a single item becomes a circlejerk at some point, especially for tech.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:39:58


That interest rate is 57 percent.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:04:34
Yeah I just checked, it asks me to verify too if I want to send some there. Weird tbh. I guess you could try opening an account on bitrex.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:30:39
Yes he is.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:10:47
Got this book a while ago, it's a pretty good read.
@_date: 2016-09-10 18:13:27
Do you have an idea of a case where that would be useful ? Just wondering.
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:45:19
They are part of the alliance because they sell private blockchain implementations.
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:13:24
It's an ad for an English translator, so why not.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:38:08
Segwit has gone through already, they are talking about BTC2X, or Segwit2X, which is a fork that is supposed to happen pretty soon.
@_date: 2016-05-24 09:11:14
* All caps title
* News from a week ago
You got it all.
@_date: 2016-05-28 09:04:14
I already have some, just a bit bitter that I missed this rise :p
@_date: 2016-05-04 08:53:11
Prove it !
@_date: 2016-05-28 06:59:34
Same thing, wanted it to go a bit more down before buying more, turned out the yuan screwed me.
@_date: 2016-05-01 22:58:57
Yeah it was quite ironic seeing RT write an article about germany and why working with dictators is bad for press freedom.
@_date: 2016-07-14 13:20:53
Well then yeah, it's worse.
@_date: 2017-06-29 10:23:08
I went to their office a while ago, they have some Zimbabwean bill on display in the entrance.
@_date: 2016-07-14 12:33:32
Isn't that type of storage already made in most western countries ? I know France does it.
@_date: 2016-07-02 11:05:50
Your best bet is localbitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:18:11
Please someone tell me that this story is a joke, if it's not that guy is damn cool
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:32:50
Off course, but i don't think anyone boss would be happy about that
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:40:03
Yeah that's what he does
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:00:31
Mining is not worth the electricity bill now anyway
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:29:37
well, just think how much the bitcoin developer mined, no wonder he want to stay anonymous he is probably really rich now.
