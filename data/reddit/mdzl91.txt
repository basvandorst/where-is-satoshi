Makes sense! And then to sell, I’d have to re-transfer into Coinbase? Or another exchange? Is there a better / more secure exchange than Coinbase? I couldn’t seem to find any unanimous info on that.

Super helpful, thanks! Can I ask - what's the drawback to leaving the btc in my Coinbase "account?"

You’ve been super helpful. Much appreciated!

Alright so lost phone = lost BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:21:16
Are there things I should be worried about other than security? Srs, not sarcastic.

As someone who just bought in a *somewhat* significant amount, can you expand on this point? Trying to quickly play catch-up around storage. Any associated reading would be much appreciated too.

I heard something about storing on a USB (as opposed to a laptop) - can you expand on this? I'm happy to read up on my own but I don't even know where to start or where a legitimate source of info is (besides Reddit)

Got it, so basically you’re defeating the purpose and it’s anti-“purist.” Understood.

I heard about Breadwallet but is Breadwallet SaaS or is it living on my iPhone natively?

Just bought into BTC and my transaction is currently pending on Coinbase. Can anyone ELI5 what this fork means, or point me to some legit info I can read up on? High level implication explanation would be super helpful!
Also, tangentially - any reason to not keep my BTC stored on Coinbase? Specifically around this event?

This is going to come off as awfully uninformed but what exactly do “keys” refer to?

Another clarification question: understanding and taking into consideration the history of bitcoin and exchanges being relatively sketchy, is there real risk of a company like Coinbase closing down (I.e. a strong case to move to a hardware wallet) or is the residual paranoia blowing the “necessity” of moving off a coinbase account out of proportion to real risk? I understand this is a loaded question, just looking for some basic insight.
I.e. this would be akin to putting all of your cash under a mattress (barring FDIC $250k insurance, for example)
