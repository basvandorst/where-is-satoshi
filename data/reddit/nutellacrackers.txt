I already have donated several hundred hours to charity, which I think is a lot more valuable.

Uhh...not sure if serious....

Thank you so much for the detailed reply! 
I have the "qt" wallet on my Computer, but it's taking a while to sync.  
I don't get an allowance, and parents will be an issue because they are paranoid about online security and spend several weeks researching a website before entering their credit card information. 
Overall, I would say I am pretty responsible with my money, especially compared with my friends. 
I'm not Bangladeshi, fortunately.

Thank you sooooo much! People here are very generous!
Where can I buy Nutella with Bitcoin (half-joking)

Hi, I signed up and played. What do I do?
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:15:43
Thanks, although none of those seem particularly appealing.

Hey, I think using social media to get people to place stickers is a great idea! I'd like some!

Would you be open to making a service that works the other way around?

Hey, I'm sorry that you think this, and if you can think of a way that will let me verify that I am a high school girl without divulging my identity, I will gladly comply. 
I find it humorous that I got "tipped" more because I am female, but I would like to thank those that helped me start out. I apologise for double posting, I'm new to Reddit and I'm not familiar with it.

Okay, sounds great!

Hey, I'd be open to verifying my identity as a high school girl as long as I don't divulge my identity. I've already gotten some DM's I'd rather not see....

Thanks so much for the tip! I'll be sure to discuss it with them this weekend, as they know next to nothing about it.

I'd love some!
