In a normal market yes, over time, not in this anonymous market

yes it does you fucking idiot. 
[people can trade with themselves]( people can sell the currency over its value in high number to buff the price up. you can create wallets at any time and move the currency around in a very hard to trace way. without personal details, it's nearly impossible to tell legitimate trades from wash trades. That's why the market keeps crashing, because it's artificially boosted by certain high dollar traders who then sell out and crash the market. The cycle repeats. You can never have a respectable crytocurrency while remaining anonymous.

The market trends upward over time. [The average annualized total return for the S&amp;P 500 index over the past 90 years is 9.8 percent.]( Of course the currency is worth more over time, but that doesn't make it a wise investment. A wise investment is one which has consistent returns and value so that you can liquidate easily when you want to. [BitCoin has historically been volatile]( and as such is not a good medium for investments. OP would be far better off buying stock or even just saving that money in an emergency fund than investing in bitcoin, especially as it is so expensive atm since the split.
