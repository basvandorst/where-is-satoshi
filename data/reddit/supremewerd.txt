Why do you think it will be better?

What type of improvements? What do you not like that you wish they could do?

Yea LB does that - but I don't like the marketplace style emphasis. I'm thinking of a hybrid between a traditional exchange(coinbase,Campbx and etc) and a LocalBtc. You'd send coins at the price you want for them and the system would automatically fill them with a match for you (or you can browse like a marketplace). The basis of my hypothesis really comes from the frustration of the UI/UX of LB. I think a much better job can be done overall with the product. But my question is - would that be enough to justify building a competitor peopel would actually use? My other thought was building a iOS/Android version of LB. Any feedback you guys would have would be wonderful. 
Edit: I also don't think it's a zero sum game. Competitors can exist and thrive as the demand for crypto currencies grows

Yeah. We're building out a progressive jackpot that will have different odds - letting you play up to a big win. Stay tuned! Any feedback would be much appreciated.

You're right. But our core focus is building an awesome experience. We have some exciting features coming soon - for example: a progressive jackpot.

Well - CampBX deals with USD and requires verification(for certain amounts) and submitting sensitive information(bank info). They are at the mercy of a regulatory framework that views them as an MSB. I still think there's an advantage to an OTC - keeping anonymity and creating a frictionless experience for users to buy btc. I've often had friends approach me about buying BTC but were not comfortable submitting info - which is where LB comes to be very handy. I'm asking if there could exist a competitor to LB and still thrive. Being a frequent seller - I just find the usability really frustrating. Alot of noobie buyers come on and have no clue what their doing. Maybe a dead simple version of LB - for noobies?
WU/MG are an advantage if you want to stay anonymous and make irreversible payments I used them as an example because they were - cash deposits would accomplish the same thing. I read about Strongcoin launching an OTC and they got a tonne of fraud attacks. Maybe a competitor to LB that has escrow and the necessary security measures to ensure users are protected. The advantage could just be better usability.
Thanks for the bitcoin-brokers link - it looks interesting. Why would they have to list banks? Wouldn't cash deposits from any bank to bank be irreversible (if it's within their own country)?

WU or MG? As long as the user doesnt release the btc from escrow before they pickup the cash from their local WU/MG it's non refundable.
