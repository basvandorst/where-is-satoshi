Hey guys, we've been around for a bit over a month now and we buy trade ins for 15-20% more than Amazon (and a lot more than CEX). If you have any questions, please ask below.

Rakuten is far more than the Amazon of Japan. Rakuten also owns Priceminister in France which is the 3rd biggest retailer there, they also own Play in the UK and other major players across the globe.

I did 50%/50% on Bitpay. Doesn't matter at the moment since I only got one in a month...
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:38:24
So how much will they be getting?
@_date: 2014-07-18 08:24:55
Which is also the reason they're trying to make it hard/impossible to use it.
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:43:26
Cashing out has to be done instantly, Bitpay does that so it's not really an issue. I believe very much in Bitcoin and obviously don't get a volume big enough that a fall in the Bitcoin price would hurt me so I go for 50/50. If you intend to make a decent amount of your sales in Bitcoin, you should really take 100% in fiat to avoid potential losses. I heard Overstock is doing 90/10, if you can afford it, why not? Chances are Bitcoin will go up, it's what it tends to do. Cashing out costs only 1% or 0% with a $50 a month plan on Bitpay so that's not an issue either.
You get interest from customers who would never hear about you otherwise because of Bitcoin, you save yourself 3/4% of Paypal/cc charge fee, it's simple to set up... Just great really.
If you're in Europe, checkout Bitpay.
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:38:19
What a load of bullshit.The proposed regulations are the same ones bank follow except they are applied to every Bitcoin business.

@_date: 2014-03-03 09:03:09
Indeed, this doesn't mean BitStamp is at risk, it just means they're big enough and powerful enough to get friendly with a bank that usually doesn't let people deal with Bitcoins (like any others).
But regardless, anybody keeping large sums of $ or BTC on any exchange after this whole fiasco is begging to get fucked.

All I see is people complaining about Apple messing around Bitcoin but when a company does something, granted a small one, (BUT the only one so far), there are still people saying "Apple doesn't care", "Waste of time".
At least they're doing something... Nobody else is, including all of the people in this thread calling this an empty gesture. Probably the same people who contribute nothing to this community besides snarky comments..

Still silly to have a transaction fee for Bitcoin, they should say that using their cards gives a 5% discount or something like that because transaction fee on Bitcoin is kinda defeating the purpose.

Sure they can, it's not rocket science. Push a button, get Bitcoin ... or don't and then get in touch with your customer. 
Why does it take them a week to let him know his purchase couldn't go through? Least they could do is get in touch and let him know in a timely manner, I'm sure OP wouldn't have minded then.
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:37:15

@_date: 2014-07-31 20:16:08
All those resources could have been used by all this VC scum to actually build on Bitcoin instead of creating a shitty knock-off in order to take large ownership from the beginning (of an uninteresting and worthless coin).

Except a BTC buy doesn't leave much room for fuck up. The only thing you could actually do to piss off your customer is to cancel their buy. It's not like retail or ordering online where many things can go wrong and you can easily find ways to forgive the mistake.
If I had been buying BTC consistently and would get a cancellation email **a week after my purchase**, I'd be moving on, too.
@_date: 2014-08-10 15:32:56
Good thing we asked.
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:28:35
BitPay will convert back to any currency but that's besides the point because I doubt Overstock would want GBP, they could convert back in USD with Coinbase just as they do in the US and not bother dealing with a third currency which would save them a lot of trouble.
I've dealt with multiple banks regarding Bitcoin here and it will take a lot more than some little exchange to convince any banks in the country to get on board with them. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 19:31:47
Are now* part of your bankroll, sorry!
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:29:19

You're right and we're never getting a UK exchange until one UK bank decides to deal in Bitcoins and having dealt with several banks in the UK, I can assure everyone that it's not going to happen at least for a while.
Owning a bank account in the UK isn't a fundamental right even though all those fucking pricks are still in business thanks to tax payers bailout funds, it's disgraceful. They can refuse to do business with you just like they can refuse for you to own an account with them without having to give you a reason.

If you'd actually bothered looking at the link, you would have known how blockchain determines these percentages.
Ghash was at 30% a few days after they went above 50% and have been gradually creeping back up which means it's a pretty safe assumption they'll be back up to 51% in no time since they have constantly disregarded this as being an issue.
Stop being such a dick and lighten up a little bit.

@_date: 2014-07-21 14:13:28
Yes, it's not a transaction fee. A transaction fee implies it's a payment which will most often go to a third party (ie a payment processor). Adding a fee on a transaction on Bitcoin is misleading because it implies that Bitcoin is taking a cut, it should be a "you're not using the payment option we would like you to be using" fee so we're randomly charging you more.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:06:25
Last time they got there, I was kinda hoping enough people were moving over to  P2Pool (Petamine and all this?) that it wouldn't happen again so quickly.
I don't understand how so many people keep mining there and buying those contracts which are not a viable investment and hurting Bitcoin.
There's all this VC money being injected into Bitcoin but if all those big players don't start paying attention to issues like this, they're gonna regret throwing millions at Bitcoin pretty soon.
What baffles me the most is Ghash, they know perfectly well that what they're doing is dangerous for their business and bitcoin itself but refuse to do anything about.

Actually, that is wrong but the issue would be that Sony does region based warranty so you need a EU console to use warranty in Europe which means you'd have to send it back to the US if you had a problem with it.
Also, you'd have to pay VAT on top of import duties and it's just not worth it to buy in the US anymore.

Because I know families this size living in 35 square meters in Paris, reality is a flat this size in a nice suburb costs 1800 euros a month.
Anyways, minimum wage in the biggest european countries (France, Germany, UK) is around 1500 a month so 25k a year isn't bad at all.
