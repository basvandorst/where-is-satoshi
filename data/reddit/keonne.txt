You can do everything but locktime and OP_RETURN with Samourai... at least if you have an Android 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:14:46
Samourai. Using it as a hot wallet since 2015, no major issues, just a few force closes every once in a while. 
Everything you asked for it does exceedingly well.

The backup you have is not from an HD blockchain wallet, it is one of the older formats from before they converted to HD. 
They should have a resource that allows you to import from the old phrase into a new wallet, but you may have to wait on support getting back to you since I cannot seem to find it on their website. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:08:08
Actually, digging around their older site I found the old URL still may work. Your 19 word mnemonic should work here. 
Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:20:41


You realize that means you don't have any Bitcoin right? Makes sense that you would make such a nonsensical post. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:56:22
You got it? Great stuff. Now move your BTC to a wallet that isn't god awful. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:45:37
1) Did you have 2FA set up 
2) Did you access your wallet via browser or mobile app?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:07:15
Depending on how old your wallet is you may need to use this mnemonic recovery tool 
Only the more recent HD wallets are BIP39 compatible, older wallets used a custom mnemonic scheme. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:04:07
I would recommend Samourai Wallet ([donation page]( 
They have been tirelessly pushing out a quality wallet with the most up-to-date functionality including rolling out Segwit (and updating BitcoinJ to support segwit), bech32 address support, basic coin control, mobile stealth payments (BIP47), custom fees, Trusted Node support,and a lot of other great stuff.
They are a very small team (3) with very little or no outside funding, and I would imagine 1 BTC would go very far for them.
Edit: They are [open source]( under the [Unlicense](
[I have been using Samourai exclusively since 2015] 
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:09:16
It really depends on a lot of factors. If the amount of BTC you have warrants it you may want to look into a hardware wallet like Trezor. If you are after a mobile phone wallet I would probably suggest Samourai on Android and Green Address on iOS I think. You obviously know enough to write your mnemonic down and keep it safe, which is great, you're way ahead of the game already ;)
As for how to send, I assume you are in Blockchain.info right now? You would click the 'Send' button and in the new wallet you would get a bitcoin address - this is usually represented as a QR code. 
You want to send from the blockchain wallet to your new wallet address. You can scan the QR code with your webcam from the send page. 
All that being said, take your time and do your research. And again, congrats on the recovery, really happy to hear that. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 11:26:04

Which code? The additional randomness from random.org? Again, for most people this added additional entropy, for a very small amount of people on very old versions of Android, it was the catastrophic opposite.
Edit: But positing that BC.i only got their random numbers from random.org is just simply not true, and I can show you the code to back that up.

If all resources are declared as common goods, then some entity must logically take those resources on behalf of the common to make them common goods. 
Who is that entity?
The expropriation of resources, as is being discussed here, is the forced removal of resources from the productive to be distributed to the unproductive common.
Who is the entity who is doing the distribution of these resources?

There absolutely is. Tap an address on the balance screen to see a chronological transaction history for the specific address.

'The Tavern Company' ? I went by and they are indeed still taking it, however I do not think the staff has been trained so you need to rely on the owner being there. And of course, no alcohol can be purchased with Bitcoin until the State of Ohio figures out that transacting with bitcoin is no different than transacting with VISA or Mastercard. 
My girlfriend and I walked the entire street and bought something from each place that accepted bitcoin. There is currently only one merchant who is actually keeping their bitcoin and not converting to fiat immedietely, and that is Shawn Paul Salon. Great guy and really great hair products.
The Wine Spot isn't listed as accepting bitcoin because they mostly serve alcohol, but they are more than happy to accept bitcoin for anything that isn't alcohol.. We paid for a cheese plate with bitcoin, and a wine flight with fiat.

Before I respond to you Charlie, I would like to address the few people reading this post. Yesterday was a very important day for our community. Earlier yesterday posted a list of reddit users who have lost Bitcoin using the wallet service Blockchain.info provides; we track posts like this closely and even have our own internal list. This discussion was welcomed by Team Blockchain and we submitted a response to this post going over the primary security concerns facing not only our users, but all users of any web based bitcoin wallet service with action items on how to make your experience more secure. Bitcoin is still a very young system and we want to be an open and responsive part of system that has, as one of its greatest virtues, incredible support from a community of people passionate about building it. 
Charlie, you should be ashamed that you have tried to turn an open dialogue with the community about our respective roles as wallet providers in providing a secure service AND the users role in keeping their funds secure, into an inappropriate attempt by you to capitalize on the security discussion today and push your own agenda, like a shady lawyer chasing an ambulance.


It is simply dishonest to argue that Blockchain.info security has stagnated or regressed. We track this data closely, have made heavy investments into combating security issues and hardening our dedicated infrastructure. Improvements, measured in decreasing numbers of breeches, have been made. This is not to say that we have the final solution in hand -  we have a long way to go still, but it is more about creating sane security defaults and educating our users on proper security protocols. We are working tirelessly to improve the overall experience of our wallet products and building new tools and technologies; many of which the community will get to judge the merits of shortly. 
The crux of the issue comes down to trying to compare apples to oranges, or should I say, a true block chain powered financial software product versus yet another online bank. We at Blockchain.info have never wanted to build a bank, we want to build the tools that allow our users to take full control of their finances, or as our slogan reads, “be your own bank”. It is ingrained into our corporate culture that our users are always in control of their private key, always is exposed to the least amount of counterparty risk, and should NEVER have to trust us. 
Coinbase is able to implement interesting security features using existing plug-n-play technologies that Blockchain simply cannot do. Our architecture ensures all transactions remain on the block chain while Coinbase operates entirely in an off block chain setting. Coinbase knows their users email address, phone number, mailing address, credit profile, and more. Blockchain doesn’t even require an email address to open a wallet. Coinbase knows the current balance, the past balances, the spending trends of every user. Blockchain has no idea how much bitcoin a wallet has. Our insistence on following the overarching vision of Bitcoin means that there will be times where the simple and easy technical solution will not work and we will need to innovate, much in the same way we innovatively created the first bitcoin wallet to be decrypted locally in the users browser thus ensuring Bitcoin users would always have an alternative to the centralized bank like institutions of Coinbase, and would ALWAYS be in full control of their private keys.
Stories of Coinbase freezing its users funds, investigating its users and reversing the suspicious transactions of long-time verified customers are well known and well documented in this sub. Even the new multi sig solution, which you you proffer above, is vulnerable to the same issues. Even if the coins are not under your sole control, users are still vulnerable and their private and personal data is still held by you and at risk. 
Part of our strategy at Blockchain has been to open source our wallet software (something Coinbase has not done as far as I am aware) We believe that this will not only help grow the community and ecosystem, gets more eyes on our code, and allows for anyone at anytime to review our code. Charlie, does Coinbase have any plans to open source any aspect of their wallet product? It is our assumption that you cannot, as users must trust you. 
Additionally, I found it very strange you brought up Insurance in your overview. Blockchain has no need to acquire insurance as we never have access to customers funds, we never have access to a users private key, we couldn’t lose our customers funds if we wanted to. Coinbase acts like a bank does today. Your users are trusting Coinbase to properly manage their bitcoin. Opening an insurance policy on millions of dollars in client assets is nothing to celebrate, its standard operating procedure. If Blockchain managed customer funds, we would also have an insurance policy. But we do not ever manage our customers funds, and we never will. It’s important to note that your insurance only covers the funds in your hot wallet - which is a tiny fraction of the funds. Users are still reliant, for the vast majority of the funds, on Coinbase to properly secure them against internal and external theft. The history of Bitcoin is not full of companies that have managed to do this in the long-term and is full of those that have failed and lost hundreds of millions of dollars in users funds. 
Lastly, I will caution your hubris regarding the state of Coinbase security. Indeed, Coinbase, as we are aware, has benefited from multiple serious disclosures from other industry members. You guys have no doubt done some great things lately, and serve a valuable role in the ecosystem, but no system is impenetrable. We should be working together as leaders in the space to create a stronger more secure ecosystem, rather than chasing after each others ambulances on reddit.  
At Blockchain, our goal is to build a powerful, world changing company and ecosystem. We hope Coinbase also feels this way and is willing to work together to build it.

This is probably a UI issue on our end. After selecting the address from the list you need to press 'Enter' or 'Done' on the on-screen keyboard (that should be active). Initiating that action should redraw the QR and address.

Once payment has been seen on the network it's usually considered pretty safe, the app displays a hollow checkmark. The merchant should consider this as proof of payment as the likelyhood of it being a double spend are pretty slim. Once there is ~~+6~~ +1 confirmation the checkmark is no longer hollow and is filled in green. 
Edit - sorry my info was wrong, once there is +1 confirmation the checkmark turns from hollow to solid.

Yikes, sorry!  At the most simple level you can just have someone scan the QR code that is displayed on that screen to quickly send you bitcoin. You can tap that QR code once to copy the address to your clipboard or you can long press the QR code to share the actual QR image. You can also select other addresses in your wallet to generate a QR code for by tapping the little contact card. Optionally you can set an amount that you are expecting and that will encode the QR with an amount for easy scanning. Hope that helped!

Coinmap is a great service but sadly there is a lot of spam. We found that over 60% of the listings we called were spam and had never even heard of bitcoin.

You could possibly try the [Blockchain Merchant App](
During setup set the receiving address to an address generated on an offline computer.
Every time you generate a new payment request a unique address will be generated for your user to scan or for you to share. The funds will be forwarded to your cold storage address defined in setup.
This may or may not be what you are after, but check it out.
@_date: 2014-01-10 09:20:26
The iOS app does have this ability, but there is a weird bug that makes it difficult. Try creating a new address, then archiving that address. Once that address is archived you will be able to scroll and see a button for importing a private key.
Hope this helps

No. I have personally set up three cafe's across two continents with a Bitcoin POS system to allow them to accept bitcoin (Pittsburgh, London, Bristol), I developed and championed the "Merchant Map" at BC.i to help bring exposure to all the early adopting merchants accepting bitcoin at their stores, cafes, and restaurants. I often pay for my coffee today with Bitcoin.
 That all being said I believe that Bitcoin has more value to offer on a global scale than the "latte network", and we won't see the mass adoption we would all like until there is a real compelling reason to use bitcoin. As states clamp down on cash, introduce negative interest rates, increase economic surveillance, and rapidly devalue their fiat currencies, Bitcoin can be well positioned to really take off. I very much appreciate the work you have put in and the services you have built Erik, thanks for everything.

This happened to me almost exactly, except with Barclays. After the investigation they closed my account. I was able to open a Basic Bank Account at Halifax afterwards, but apparently there is still some sort of black mark on my record because every Faster Payment I receive (usually from localbitcoins) gets delayed and the sender warned that this may be fraud. Good luck.

Imported Addresses = The watch only addresses, and addresses that have private keys that were apart of your blockchain.info wallet before you upgraded it to the new version. These addresses do not lie within the new HD architecture and funds cannot be backed up with the 12 word mnemonic.
My Bitcoin Wallet  = A single HD account that contains an infinite amount of addresses for you to consume. Funds that are in 'My Bitcoin Wallet' can easily be restored with the 12 word mnemonic.

Highly doubtful. More likely, that is what Roger was told by bc.i leadership when he questioned them and he accepted it at face value.
While I was Product Lead at Blockchain.info it became very clear that there was no plans or intention to invest time or resources to the shared send service, no matter how much I, other former employees, or even Roger lobbied for it. 
Most likely, bci is getting ready to release an update that introduces KYC into their wallet so users can buy and sell directly within the wallet... to do so with minimal regulatory complication they found it easier to kill a service that they didn't want anyway.
Not sure how the buy/sell service is going to work but there is a decent chance that for many who choose to buy/sell,  bci will become a custodial wallet subject to a whole new level of scrutiny by regulators. It would be easier, theoretically, to defend against aggressive regulators by just getting rid of a service that antagonises said regulators.

I have been using it for a week very successfully. 
Loading requires you send Bitcoin to a multi-sig address (not sure what the benefit of multi-sig is here as I never got a copy of my key, but whatever, buzzwords.) and becomes available to you after 6 confirmations.
You can order a card denominated in USD, GBP, or EUR.
You can request a virtual card number for free.
You can request a physical card for a fee. You can expidte the delivery of the card for an additional fee. Don't bother doing that, I paid for expidted and my friend did standard and we got the card on the same day.
Once you have a card and BTC in the wallet you can load the BTC onto the card. The BTC is converted to the Fiat type and the loading is instant. 
You get your PIN by requesting an email after activation.
When you spend you get a text message with details of the spend and the remaining balance.
That is pretty much it. It works as advertised. I like it. 
Edit: One big criticism is their mobile site. It is impossible to load a card from the mobile site due to certain elements being hidden, which really hampered on the go refills. I hope the team addresses this soon.

Perhaps you can set up a simple web server for use on your local network. Use web sockets to communicate the json-rpc endpoints with your front end whenever a new transaction enters the mempool.

@_date: 2018-12-29 14:04:03
I wrote this while I was still Product Lead for Blockchain.info - I had just got out of a particularly testy meeting with the person they hired to replace me - Lars Kruger
Blockchain leadership, including Peter Smith, Nic Carey, and Roger Ver were all intent on pushing this vision of global Venmo style digital Disney dollars which they would be able to help mold and control (Bitcoin in their eyes is too wild, too anarchist, and requires grown up's to reign it in. They were the grown ups). I and the few remaining original employees were not interested in that vision and we shortly thereafter were forced out / fired / quit (depending on who you ask)
Once it became clear that Blockchain had no interest in the Bitcoin I had signed up for, I wrote these series of tweets. I never expected them to gain so much attention. The fact they still get attention today shows that the vision of Bitcoin that Peter, Roger, and Nic tried to foist on us (with their endless promotion of forks like XT, Classic, BU, S2X) is not wanted or desired by the majority of bitcoin users. Let's hope that doesn't change.

An idea doesn't exist in the physical reality, only in your head, and onto whatever medium you notate that idea. If someone 'steals' your idea, you don't lose the idea, it still exists, so it isn't actually stealing is it?


Sounds like all you're interested in is restricting other peoples rights to create new things using the shared knowledge of ideas somehow using Bitcoin. Seems like a strange thing to pursue but by all means go for it. If you do a bit of looking around you'll find a bunch of IP related block chain projects and startups out there. Ascribe.io is the first one that springs to mind.

Good luck suing Coinbase. By using their services you agree to binding arbitration. Check out their [User Agreement]( pretty shifty stuff.

No worries. For what it's worth, I am selling BTC on bittylicious currently but for some reason the Bittylicious website currently says it is offline. 
Another option worth looking at and watching is [bitquick]( If bittylicious doesn't sort it self out in the next few hours I'll probably move my BTC to bitquick and sell on there.
Good luck

I recommend a Nexus 5

That is what I thought as well. I don't know if that means they are pushing back the announcement until Christmas Day or if there is just confusion.

Open running processes and look for 'agent' if you don't see that you should be good. Spectosoft is pretty adept at keeping hidden from the scanners.

Check for Spector Pro Mac or eBlaster Mac on your computer - Those both have the ability to take screenshots of your screen every X seconds and send them back remotely to a malicious attacker in addition to keystrokes, emails sent and received, chats sent and received, keyword alerts (take screenshot when "bitcoin" and "api" appear etc...)

I heard it's the loneliest number since the number one

As far as I know European Value Added Tax is generally the same as an American Sales Tax. It's just a tax on consumption (granted Sales Tax in the US is not centrally determined, rather it is decided by local municipalities, and in general is a much lower rate than VAT).

I'd check out [Bittylicious](

with fine print like that, you should consider becoming a lawyer.

Good job OP! I once had a buyer send me £4,600 instead of £46.00 for a bitcoin transaction. Were my morals questioned....honestly yes, but the guy got his money back, and he didn't have a bad taste left in his mouth regarding bitcoin. More than worth it imo

If you're in the UK you can try [bittylicious]( 
@_date: 2013-12-31 09:10:04
Don't keep your private key on any device that can be hacked. Solved.

Came here to say it, glad I didn't have to. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:43:51
This 'vulnerability' is ridiculous, and demonstrates you are completely out of your depth in understanding. ~~Anyway, you admitted you submitted a virtually identical vulnerability before in the first line of the email to Coinbase thereby nullifying your right to a bounty as per their rules written clearly on the bounty page.~~ 
EDIT: I misread originally, nevertheless its not really a vulnerability. 
Try harder. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:37:02
I've found [Bittylicious]( to be very quick and easy, and with the least amount of required ID verification. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:29:27
I agree. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:16:22
fuck you, go die. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:03:36
dude, I didn't make the app... I was just trying to answer your initial complaint. Sorry I bothered.
@_date: 2013-11-08 08:14:48


You hardly see that word used enough
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:11:45
It's like IKEA threw up in your living room. Just kidding, nice place. I did the same thing :)
@_date: 2013-10-12 09:19:06
I'm interested in the answer to this question as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:51:02
As a seller of BTC in the UK and EU we never, ever, label any transaction with the keywords BTC or Bitcoin. It's just asking for trouble. Sorry you had to learn this the hard way. I also cannot wait for NEO to open up shop.
@_date: 2013-12-31 09:31:11
I don't disagree, but I did resolve your initial concern, hopefully your experience is slightly better in the future. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:06:19
I would argue, that at his age, the risk is entirely worth it. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:12:35
Bought one. Can't wait to check it out and store it with the rest of my street art collection. I have a frame next to my Futura 2000 original with your name on it.

See the QR code icon at the top right of the Send Page. Tap it... You won't be disappointed.

Good concept needs more refinements. When printed you will hardly be able to see those coins popping out of the water. Consider a graphic/illustrated representation of the Miami skyline with popping bright colors. 
Overall you're on the right track, just 3 or 4 revisions out. 
Good luck OP. 
EDIT - also consider the more [traditional view]( of the Miami skyline. 
EDIT 2 - sorry, you got my wheels spinning - remember when Britto covered the islands off of miami in that pink plastic. maybe a riff on something like that somehow, miami and surrounding islands covered in bitcoin. lol

Yeah, I've known josmul123 for years, and is my friend on reddit, and I disagree with him frequently and vocally about lots of things. But he's not wrong here, he knows what he is talking about. Believe it or not, I am capable of forming my own opinions, and I don't spend my free time acting as some sort of Reddit Shill. My 6 year account history kinda proves that... and resorting to calling anyone who challenges you a shill just makes you look even more ridiculous than you do right now.

I'm looking for art and creative items, as well as furnishings and items for my home. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:13:22
Received mine as well, so happy with it!
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:08:03
Just wanted to post an update here. I recieved a very well secured parcel today with all the paintings gently rolled up. I am really happy with the quality, the size, and the skill. Thanks Tabby
