Is this giveaway over?
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:17:40
I searched the keyword giveaway and set the result filter to "new"
Apparently the amount of giveaways on bitcoin is smaller than the amount on dogecoin, and it was on the first page of results.

Doing nothing is the worst option. Once the # of transactions goes above 10000 per block, the bytes needed to process all of them reach the 1MB limit and the system breaks (You can't send any more transactions for that block).

Bitcoin can only go up. People keep forgetting the simple fact that there's a cap on the # of bitcoin: 2.1x10^7
As long as people are using massive amounts of electricity to mine bitcoin, bitcoin will have value. This follows because if bitcoin had no value people wouldn't use electricity to mine it, but people are mining it so it must have value.

Do you mean that the block won't be accepted so you'll lose out on 12.5 BTC?
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:52:20
The block rewards are halved every 210000 blocks. Each block takes 10 minutes to mine on average. Every 2016 blocks, the difficulty is adjusted so that each block takes exactly 10 minutes to mine. Otherwise, we would run out of bitcoins to mine way too fast.
Right now the reward is 12.5 BTC, it will be 6.25 BTC by ~2020.

Bitcoin has value because it's scarce. The reward is halved every 4 years so that there will be a finite amount of bitcoins (21 millions).

I'm betting on the price being $2000 by the end of 2017.

Why don't websites accept addresses with a 3?
@_date: 2017-04-12 02:35:39
Looking through the addresses and continuously clicking on transactions, it appears that all the bitcoins have been sold by now.

You're going to need mohland to store all that Doge. Try "borrowing" some doge from someone else to pay for a cold wallet.

The BTC got sent back to coin.space, so I'll just use the minimum fee and then try CPFP.
By the way, coin.space needs to get its shit together. I just realized right now that the default transaction fee on coin.space (that it wouldn't allow me to use) is 3.3mBTC. CPFP is actually cheaper in this instance, even though CPFP is usually more expensive than a typical transaction. The average transaction fee is 0.6mBTC, so why should coin.space set such a ridiculously high fee?

The math in the article is wrong. It's $0.003, not 0.003 cents. Also, their explanation of how BTC is mined is extremely shitty. I'm sick of the media saying that the computer solves a math problem. Why can't they say that the computer is randomly guessing numbers? Even that explanation is better, albeit being shitty. 
They could at least say "The computer takes the SHA 256 hash of a string containing a nonce and a few other inputs, then checks if the hash is below a certain number." This explanation is still simplified, yet it suffices. It's surprising that Yahoo can't even give that explanation.

I was moving the money to electrum. That transaction cleaned out the wallet and now I have nothing left in coin.space if it confirms.

Onecoin should be renamed scamcoin.
