Did you read the article? It was ~50 franchises, not the corporate level. Here are the impacted franchises:

Thanks! I try to be objective on things. I spent too long in security though, so I am paranoid about ALL THE THINGS

What do you use for the alarm? Assuming you have some application for it.

Didn't downvote! UPS as a whole was not hacked, it was the POS machines. I 100% agree, POS machines need to be locked down. I work in software security, so I am very aware of the security landscape now.

Ugh, PCI compliance is such a pain. So many companies claim PCI compliance but do not have it.
I totally agree, if done right, bitcoin can be more secure. There will still be risk for people though, specifically to loss of private key / wallet information. That can be hedged by good practices on the user side, but people are almost always going to be the main source of security issues. (IE; Joe Schmoe leaves his private key on his desktop and then downloads tons of porn which contains malware OR {insert social engineering example here})

I miss that bar. I went there a few times when I lived out that way :(

I mean, Bitcoin has been the subject of malware as well. I don't think Bitcoin as a platform makes it intrinsically more secure. 
I definitely agree it has the potential to be more secure, but it still has failings that involve human error or breaches.

Hopefully everything can be more secure. I have a dream that I won't need to be paranoid whenever I swipe (which hopefully goes away with chip and pin) or when I put my card in on websites (which will hopefully go away when companies can issue card numbers for individual use or per site usage).
I am all for bitcoin, and it is an awesome platform with a lot of cool things going on with it. In my mind, any security risk is bad, and as is, all payment methods have *some* security risk.
Anywho, I do love this subreddit since it always bring some fantastic conversations!

The future holds a lot of awesome technology.

File a complaint with the FCC (assuming you live in the US). They should not be blocking "access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices"

They don't keep logs, which makes them at least a little safer.

Where are you trading at? I was just thinking of getting into the trading business myself...

My VPN connection was WAY slower when using my router that had Tomato on it, I ended up just using the client on my desktop.

The company Bloomberg uses their own terminal style application for everything (mail, IM, news). In the terminal, you can look up news, stock information etc. It is a pretty cool application with a steep learning curve, but has A LOT of information.
