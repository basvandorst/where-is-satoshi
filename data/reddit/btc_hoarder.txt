Sorry you lost money. Personally I don't believe 750k btc were stolen. It's a cover up.

They are probably on the run. I wouldn't hang around if I was them. Their lives are in danger.

Nice guide. I'm going to try this.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:27:23
Don't believe it. Either the whole thing is fake or a well crafted cover up.

$100k in profit but I have no intention of cashing out.

The wording in that document is overly sensationist especially for an internal document. Unnecessary use of bold font, etc. I am extremely sceptical.

I'd expect an early miner to be fucking loaded. Unless they cashed out early too.

Great service. Have and will use again.

Hang in there. It's only money. There are more important things in life.

I've had Bitcoin Compulsive Disorder now since March. I have tried to leave my coins safely offline and forget about Bitcoin, many, many times. I just can't do it.

It's a funny quote, for those who get it. But I think wearing shirts like that is slightly arrogant.

A store of wealth under my complete control is enough of a use for me. Although, I have found that buying foreign currencies using localbitcoins while travelling is actually quite awesome.

Bitcoin will make things better for sure, but it will not solve the problem of human greed.

True, it is not a selling point. Maybe he was trying to suggest that Bitcoin can be used to acquire illegal things, and there is nothing that can be done to prevent that.

Sure, companies and governments could create their own digital currency. But the Bitcoin ecosystem has had years of head start and there is no catching up with it now, unless another crypto currency offers something revolutionary that cannot be backported into Bitcoin.

Amen brother.
