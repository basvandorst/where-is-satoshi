I use IndependentReserve. Apart from the competitive fee (0.5%) they have excellent security and I have to believe highly compliant given they offer SMSF the option to invest directly in btc and ether. And please move your funds off exch into a hardware wallet if u dont need them on there for trading. I use a nano s but trezors are just as good. Good luck

Let’s just all agree to agree

Are segwit addresses anymore or less secure than legacy addresses? I’ve been planning on migrating to multi-sig for sometime for enhanced security and wonder if this is still required if moving to segwit addresses; if so is it better to use 2/3 legacy multi-sig or 2/3 segwit multi-sig?

No problems with it but like others said I only use it when they list coins that are not on say bittrex or poloniex

is there any issue with spending funds from both a legacy UTXO and a new segtwit UTXO in the same spend transaction? and can this be done with this ledger upgrade?

i've wanted to move my normal btc address over to a 2-3 multisig setup for sometime for the added security but have hesitated due to it being less convenient and then having to protect 2 additional  signing devices/parties. so given segwit addr are also P2SH style addr do i get a better security without the additional op-sec headache of multsig than a normal btc P2PKH?

Would be funny if you loaded a hardware wallet (wrapped in a bow) with the funds and go “here’s that money you gave me last Christmas”.
