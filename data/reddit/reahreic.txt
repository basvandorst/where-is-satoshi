The sheer volume of energy use to mine a single coin. Miners aren't energy efficient.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:45:47
To be fair you did directly reference their personal refrigerator.
But yes energy use in general is high. It's my understanding that Satoshi designed it this way on purpose.

Nah my home loan is at 3.5% it's financially not worthwhile paying it off while markets return between the average 6 and this year's 17ish percent.

Just got going with bitpay as an intermediary, forgot about the fee afternoons translation time, shit, I used bitpays default. Atm said 5 mins. What happens if that time expired?
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:38:55
Exactly, how do more people not get this. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:31:40
Similar problem here, not as much as 200k though and not in a medical field, but still. 
I lolled at your Sallie Mae ex comment, even though she changed her name to Navient, all those I know who knew her by old name have a similar opinion.

Thousands, damn... And here I'm looking at my 1.5 eth and looking at purchasing like 0.01ish btc when my money clears.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:50:18
New to crypto myself, but do people really actually donate crypto? Seems strange to me in general.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:11:54
Aah, ok.

I tend to use that exchange for traiding mostly so the little that's there is usually in flux.

No this is why Craigslist is a pure joke. That being said we'll be selling our 2010 vw GTI 2 door manual in a month or so, talking offers. Vehicle is in good condition, just needs roof liner replaced (common problem)

Even those who bought in January if 2017 don't need to hodl. Most of the coins had their massive gains in the later half of the year.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:35:15
What if I sit somewhere between the two, as a developer.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:40:36
Yup, jumped out, but already have my re-buy position set for when it hits.

Kraken is the reason I missed the last xrp rally, I stopped using them

90% of the websites out there look like design projects. Efficient function with regards to purpose tends to lose out as most designers focus to much on the glamor of the design for the marketing dept as opposed to it's ability to be useful.
I Implement the designs of designers, and most of the time less is more. Lightweight, efficient designs almost always work better. (Or are better for the user)

C'mon, but I need a temporary crash so I can buy more at a discount, how about $10 for two days then back up to $20k.
Is that too much to ask?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:29:31
So how does one get in on this.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:15:38
Because all coins have been getting a massive pump since May and it's correction time.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:24:30
AHEM, Sallie Mae... 
She still vexes my monies, each time I thought, here's a hundred spare I should buy some BTC, she ended up getting it instead.
Hindsight being what it is I should have dumped my entire payment into BTC and I've be free of her lol.

Not everyone wants to be a billionaire, is settle for a mere 1.25 to 2 mill.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:11:13
Sounds like a major flaw with the system.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:26:33
Except 2017 was a freak year for all coins, there's no guarantee that 2018 will see the same pumping. (2015 to 2016 is more reasonable to expect)
That being said, I'm hoping it will pull a 2017 again, need to pay off those student loans lol.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:19:27
I hodled my 0.001 BTC, for a while then I swapped it for eth. Do the rules of hotel still apply
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:20:58
My secrets come with lots of pain, suffering and missed opportunities that I'm making up for.

When did mining on a pi become viable again? I thought the minimum in was an antminer now.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:30:26
Nope as part of account verification...
