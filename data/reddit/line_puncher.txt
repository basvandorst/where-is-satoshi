Raspberry pi for the win ? Mini computer to the tune of about 30-40 bucks. You can even install 7 or 8 inch touchscreen on those for about 100 bucks i believe (YMMV please check it out first, i could be slightly out of range on this prices)

This is somewhat correct, though i wouldn't say they own most of the bitcoins currently in circulation, but large amount of bitcoin . Those large accounts are called whales in the trading lingo. They do have some influence on the market, but i'm not qualified to explain it too well either.

He talked about French wine couple of days ago too. Doesn't politicize it much really. As I said, their involvement in everything doesn't make everything political.

Fiat  is political. Bitcoin is not.

I just did. Turtle trader. True story. Simple strategy. 
The first of the 2 rules of success is to never tell everything you know.

Not necessarily in a lump sum, which is what people shouldn't do. Invest a bit, sell at a profit. rince repeat. 
Exemple : buy 10$ of btcoin once a day. Sell if price rise by 5%. 
The next day, you buy 10$ again, with the same 10$. If price fell, you buy with another 10$, with the same goal. 
within a year you cleared 10K of volume. Most likely several times.

I don't get the difference.

Nope. Dilligently accounted for every penny lost and gain over the years. And it's a positive result so far. Discipline gets you there.

Unfortunately, i will not. I understand your need for proof, and i hope you will understand my need for privacy. 
The outline i use is based on Dollar Cost Average. With a tweak or two to fit my needs. 
You can DCA pretty much any SP500 stock and come up ahead. You'll find loads of documentation on this. 
Same with bitcoin. DCA bitcoin for 5 years. at 1$ per day if you want. You'll be in profit regardless of the time you started. 
I can only remind people of the basic principle of investment. 
Only invest money you can afford to lose (consider it lost the second you invested it). 
Have a plan. Stick to your plan. 
Time is your best friend. If you disregard it, it will be your worse enemy. The best time to invest was ten years ago. Second best time is now. Make sure you are not in the same position in 10 years. 
Don't be emotional. 
Stick to your plan. 
Stick to your plan.
Stick to your plan. (AKA be disciplined, when times are good, AND ESPECIALLY, when times are bad. There will be ups and downs)

Simple strategy has been proven to work in the past. You can check the turtle trader experiment. Simple strategy. Big earnings for the disciplined ones. Not so much for the others.
@_date: 2019-01-31 16:48:29
Slow and steady wins the race.   
The best time to buy bitcoin was 10 years ago. The next best time is today.  
Don't fret. Accumulate.

You said it indeed. Doesn't mean it's true. 
Also Trump doens't have anything to do with my farmers, my government is equally inept/ corrupted as yours. i assumed it is america, hence teh wallmart example but you can switch it to any big chain store you have in your country. apologies if i'm wrong, and i'm sure your government sucks just as much as mine.
But just to be clear, no farmers can not just plant and harvest year in year out. Look it up for real instead of just repeating your own unsubstanciated claim. You'll find a disturbing painting of the living conditions for people producing the food you eat.

Thanks to the EasyWallet app, about 30 business will offer a way to pay, directly in shop, in crypto to their customers, as soon as Q1 2020.
Despite the defiance of public authorities, cryptocurrencies are still developping. SEveral associated companies from the digital payment sector have announced this Tuesday (24/09/2019) that over 25000 point of sales will be available for the public to use in 2020, steming from over 30 business group such as Decathlon, Sephora or Maisons du Monde. 
Thanks to the solution named East2PlayPayment et the EasyWallet app, developed in a joint venture with Global POS, about 30 business group (Boulanger, Foot Locker, Decathlon, Conforama, Maison du Monde, Intersport, Cultura, Norauto and Sephora), will have access to this payment solution by Q1 2020, as mentionned in a press statement. 
"The usual inner working of those businesses will not be impacted as excahnges will be in charge of the conversion from crypto to euro" details the press statement. 
From 3% to 6% of French people own crypto currencies. 
Crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin, are virtual currencies resting on a chain of block or "blockchain". according to different studies from 2017 to 2018, between 3 to 6% of french people would be in possession of some crypto. According to Global POS, presenting themselves as the leader in dematerialised prepayed card and digital payment, the announcement made at the Paris Retail Week conference is more than just a "symbolic step" : it will open the possibility to distributors to "enter the 3.0 economy risk free".
"If at first, the service will only allow payment in Bitcoin, our goal is to open our solution to other cryptocurrencies in the futur" added Stepahne Djiane, CEO and founder of GLobal POS, mentionne in the statement. For GRegory Hervein, cofounder of Moustache (products for pet cats and dogs), "accepting cryptocurrencies is a real challenge for businesses and we are aware of the expectations of the public and of the reach of this messsage we are snding to a whole community". "We're happy to make this ecosystème more real for consummers and to enter the crypto economy in a legal frame", helped by the PACTE law, he added in the statement.

And it seems to me a good model on which to based your limited ressource supply. You know that nature thing that only produces so much in a given period of time. Economic growth at all cost is a fallacy. Ressources are limited within a year, so should be "economic growth".

Planting tress : well i hope you do some of this yourself, we gonna need it sooner than later. Don't understand the point though. you plant a tree. Well you're in luck, it won't produce anything for a couple of years. Then what ? You sell the production before it's even there ?
Renewables : You don't produce something out of nothing in any domain. Except economics. And it's the only field where things are fucked up across the board. So get this idea out of your mind, you cannot produce something from nothing. Renewable means not depleted when used. It doesn't mean "infinite supply so go at it as much as you think you can, you'll never run out". such a thing doesn't exist in the universe. Because you don't see or understand the source doesn't mean it doesn't exist and is in unlimited supply. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
Population increase, cost increase: yes indeed. And i don't understand where you're going with this, nor which part it's answering to.
And last but not least -  Trying to link monetary supply to resources it just crazy :  
This is the best part. Let's go at it WWTBAM style, you might relate to this :
Money is meant to be a model defining a common and stable measure of exchange for what ?
A/ Time                    B/Matter
C/Food                    D/Skills
E/All of the above (A.K.A. RESSOURCES)
hint: the 50/50 life line won't help you on this one.
It is important to understand the environment you're trying to model before designing your model. Unfortunately, i have never seen an economist understand the basic laws of physics that are ruling this earth. I do however have seen many economists thinking they know how the world works. Only to be proven wrong time and time again.Einstein was right 60 odd years ago about stuff he couldn't see nor measure. And many other real scientist have had such a priviliege (think about the theories of infection before the invention of the microscope, radioactivity, electricity, and so many more)
Not one economists can boast the same. They've all been wrong. Consecutively. One after the other. Economics is more like the best way not to do something, which is a valid approach called empirism (try and fail until you succeed), so long as you realise you shouldn't be doing it this way after it failed. Which economists don't.
Now if you can't be bothered to tackle an entire post, do'nt bother answering it. Don't half assed 2 things at once. Whole ass 1 things at a time.

Not cool YET !  
It can't be all great from the get go. Look at it this way : it means millions of people will be hearing about BTC, hopefully the system is well design and they will witness frictionless and quick payment. And they'll be seeing the BTC sign several time during the week.   
No small victory in this battle.
@_date: 2019-09-19 08:14:48
I have. You might wanna look up the definition. You'll gain something doing so. 
i can mean : (of a natural resource or source of energy) not depleted when used.
How does printing a new dollars for every apple grown a solution ? 
Now, let's put the average money spend during an average lifetime at 3 millions USD. So for every birth we print 3M USD ?
Money is meant to circulate (as in C.I.R.C.L.E) which means it should end up at the same place at some stage (like renewable, the money supply shouldn't be depleted when used if you wanna have a coherent modelisation for money and its use)
If ressources are not growing, it makes no sense try and exploit them more. Especially if the world population is growing. Supply and demand should be something you understand right ? 
If supply is fixed, how do you make it grow ? Well, you don't. 
New jobs for all the new people being born ? then you don't want robots working in factories ? so you actually are anti progress, hence you believe business don't need to borrow to invest in R&amp;D ? 
The economic model is not at all coherent with the ressources we have at hand. It's not hard to understand. We have more peolpe for the same amount of ressources (actually, for less and less ressources each year but i don't wanna includes several varying parameters for simplicity's sake) which means, we have to make better use of those, year in, year out. And slapping a higher price tag due to inflation is not a qualitative measurement of ressources' worth. 
Hope it helps.

Farmer planting their own seeds ? Laughs in Monsanto ! 
Farmer making money on their crops ? Laughs in whatever big store chain you have in your country. 
Check the reality of farming. This might send a shiver down your spine. In my country, it's 1 farmer taking his life everyday, and the pace is increasing for the last 20 years. Surely cause they can grow crops and make money so easily, they are depressed and lose their sense of purpose. Must be that. Not depression due to debt and a spiraling system of lousy investment forced onto them by economical powers out of their reach (think Wallmart and such lobbying government so they can send back unsold good to farmers and be reimbursed for thee priviledge) 
Farmers are getting raped so you can eat avocado and strawberries all year long. 
You so out of touch with the reality of this world, that you don't even realise it. If you can't acknowledge the economic system is fucked up, then do'nt even bother fighting for it. Just have at it. 
But just so i undestand, what are you even doing here ?
