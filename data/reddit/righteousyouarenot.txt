@_date: 2018-09-09 03:44:16
Remind me 2020
@_date: 2018-09-05 03:51:46
You can track food. TE foods is doing it already. You should check them out.
@_date: 2018-09-07 14:02:16
Cough.. Bull*
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:56:22
You spelled hodl wrong.. Reminds me of that snickers commercial No regerts
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:53:36
Everybody knows alts go up when bitcoin goes up. And there's good reason to believe bitcoin will be rising for the next couple of months. I'd like to know what they do with the bitcoin. Which alts are they buying? 
@_date: 2018-09-20 05:16:01
You my friend are a genius.
@_date: 2018-09-05 02:30:36
What would be even better is the food being tracked on the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-09-05 05:01:26
I have no idea what you're trying to get across but you should probably wear house slippers so you dont step on so many Legos. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:46:13
End of summer sale!!!��
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:52:47
Hell no let's get him to sell his Bitcoin for gold and then we'll raise the price of gold up haha
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:04:17
He went dat way.
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:24:56
I thought about the same thing while pooping. I bought Bitcoin at that moment. Right before I flushed. ����
@_date: 2018-08-05 18:49:56
I believe him man. I don't know why but I do.
@_date: 2018-08-15 00:24:46
Please girl don't you cry. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 14:21:52
How about bcash goes down while everything else rises?
@_date: 2018-09-03 01:31:12
He's probably day trading.
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:11:21
Holy crap! That's my 2nd favorite! To the ��!!
@_date: 2018-08-20 02:02:54
The one's who are suppressing crypto are the one's with the most to lose. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 03:52:25
I'm guessing the bottom is around 5200 this time. I don't think there is enough tether for everyone..lol
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:48:20
Just don't cash out for 5 to 10 years...
@_date: 2018-08-04 02:49:06
Lmao thanks for this post.
@_date: 2018-08-16 02:37:46
Hey who you calling a dummy? Lol
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:57:00
Yeah PayPal doesn't have your back for crypto. I sold some crypto through PayPal back in December and most big transactions went thru, thank God. But I had 1 chick say she didn't buy it. She sent me a selfie of her while holding up her ID plus my eBay sale page in the background on her laptop. They still sided with her. I haven't sold thru PayPal since. Most people are good but there will always be a few that are rotten.
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:12:02
Somebody's trying to buy kcs for cheap... 
@_date: 2018-08-05 05:45:28
At least worth 3 satoshi
@_date: 2018-08-03 03:35:29
@_date: 2018-08-03 04:19:20
Not too random, just going by the last 3 dips this year.
@_date: 2018-08-08 03:41:19
Is it time to come out of tether yet?
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:21:31
Still waiting for abundant amount of money.
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:40:26
Preaching to the quire.. I was saying tether at 8200.
@_date: 2018-08-08 03:39:53
Tether makes me happy everyday!
@_date: 2018-08-18 03:30:44
@_date: 2018-08-31 04:01:02
Looks like we're going up til November. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:40:46
@_date: 2018-08-02 04:26:10
The best part is if btc keeps going down you can get more for cheaper. True story ��
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:06:41
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:04:15
5800 is pretty close no?
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:53:02
The nano wallet is my fastest app opening. The fastest transaction time of any coin I use. The least amount of fees. Just stating the truth.
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:48:50
Lol it's all true sadly. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:55:40
Don't worry. The other buy walls haven't been built yet. Btc down 7% today. 10% happens faster than you think. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:39:22
Seems like USDT has been reliable also. Its down 0% in the same timeframe. And the market cap has grown.
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:19:45
None of your business! Lol
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:12:46
Yay!!! Now you guys are only down 20% this week!!! Woo hoo
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:22:25
What? Who's gonna eat their shorts?? Film it
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:15:23
Man you're right there with my favorite, Supoman. He's the best hands down. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:54:34
No just the whales eating a bunch of little fish.
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:00:37
Kucoin is an exchange..
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:27:59
I like this chart for some reason
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:11:38
That seems to be the pattern.
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:02:54
That's it!!??
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:58:07
Why's he holding a gun. Does he want to shoot the whales?
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:49:17
If you were smart enough to buy Bitcoin early, you should be able to explain it to them better than asking a bunch of noobs on Reddit..lol. Just tell them now is the time to buy!
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:36:04
Omg what is this iota?? Lol
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:58:44
@_date: 2018-08-15 03:24:16
Holy crap now I'm even more paranoid lol
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:01:10
Or butt coin? I think buttcoin is classier
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:39:58
The people trying to make more satoshi. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:28:24
Here come the bears..
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:58:19
It's all imaginary money...
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:18:27
Bitcoin gold is the real bitcoin! Lol.
@_date: 2018-08-05 03:43:01
I believe that also but this drop  I'm guessing 5200 then back up to 7500 then back down to 4500 then up to 7000 then down to 4000 or maybe 3000 around November.
@_date: 2018-08-19 05:52:09
It WAS a lambo..
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:30:10
Great that means a drop is coming. Aaaahhhhh
@_date: 2018-08-15 03:20:06
As long as the barter system still works, we'll be fine.
@_date: 2018-08-04 02:29:25
And you just raised btc by .00000000001%. Yay ��
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:04:44
I came to see the proof and it's removed. Darn! Another worthless link
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:32:53
Yes unless you want to wait for the 50% off Christmas sale!
@_date: 2018-08-19 05:50:25
Damn couldn't even afford a color camera back then.
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:17:48
@_date: 2018-08-08 03:52:59
The government must have bought crypto at the ath.
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:04:06
He needs to slap some sense in you! Then buy tether. ��
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:43:27
I just hope we hit the bottom already..
@_date: 2018-08-31 17:10:13
Lol I'm up 45% since I invested in December. Thanks for your condolences tho. ��
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:51:31
You guys need to check out nano. It's the fastest and no fees. Nano &gt; btc imho
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:22:18
My deek
@_date: 2018-08-26 05:11:39
Yee Haw!!
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:59:39
Into but coin?
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:51:10
I heard Jo Mama was buying.
@_date: 2018-08-03 03:42:50
But it's still dipping..
@_date: 2018-08-05 03:08:56
The support lines always change. They're not always reliable. After it hits the first sell line the other two lines could disappear or change. Most alts dumped hard this time. Looks like the biggest drop is coming. That's just an opinion.
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:20:12
Looks like a handicap sign.
@_date: 2019-03-31 13:56:16
Here take an upvote for this shitpost.
@_date: 2018-10-09 19:38:08
Would be better if he had a cape and a mask
@_date: 2018-10-22 05:21:16
Good points but I'm sure the city will be paid back in taxes pretty quickly. Other cities may follow suit. This is what we need for adoption. Not sure of the politics behind getting the contract but I'm sure if the offer to the city, or any other city for that matter, is sweet enough then the city would agree. And yes we need to take more of the pie.
@_date: 2018-10-22 04:00:59
Link to the article. Old news but a lot of people may not know. They say the warehouse will be the biggest in North America.
@_date: 2018-10-22 12:37:39
Yea I wonder what they pay for electricity also. It's pretty loud when you drive by the warehouse but still friggin cool that its up and running. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 04:39:34
I didn't listen to but I'll give an upvote just because he wants attention.
@_date: 2019-02-14 01:37:18
That's what I picked up from this too haha
@_date: 2018-11-19 05:24:46
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:26:44
All I read was application for extraction and AssUp
@_date: 2019-01-12 23:20:51
I'm seriously getting tired of Bart.
@_date: 2019-01-11 22:47:15
@_date: 2019-01-31 16:44:26
My condolences.
@_date: 2018-07-27 03:07:37
Already tethered on the 1st red bar..waiting to buy back in.
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:01:14
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:40:13
The crazy guy that forked bitcoin and made bitcoin cash and now wants people to believe that bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-29 00:33:17
I'm interested in Pura coin but hard to find info and the reddit page looks abandoned.
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:04:02
Ouch!! You should definitely move all your crypto to a new account with a new email and new 2fa. That's if you can't get a ledger today. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:00:17
But then set the sale price at 8200 before bed and woke and it was sold. ��
@_date: 2018-07-29 05:36:14
Bitcoin diamond, bitcoin gold, bitcoin cash..what's the difference? They all seem really similar except for the prices.
@_date: 2018-07-27 19:37:59
Yea luckily I got back in at 7850.
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:38:44
21 million
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:56:37
6600 here we come!
@_date: 2018-07-31 02:50:48
Rogerver is a mad man.
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:30:49
What a waste of money!
@_date: 2018-07-29 05:13:48
My girlfriend thinks like that 24-7
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:31:11
As long as the person doesn't have your email address then you should be fine because of the 2fa.
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:37:05
Oh well in that case its totally cool! Lol
@_date: 2018-07-30 22:18:52
@_date: 2018-07-29 03:08:25
I've read a bunch of those already. Looking for something positive
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:43:03
I hope so! Double up!!
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:23:14
It may not help you in this situation but hopefully it will help a few other people avoid a situation like this.
@_date: 2018-12-14 15:34:21
Should have bought tether lol. Just kidding congrats
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:12:26
It's going to 25k for sure!
