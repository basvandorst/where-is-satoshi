You've got that backwards I believe; short term gains / losses are treated as ordinary income (i.e. your tax bracket), long term gains/losses are 15%.
You only pay the gain once, during the tax year you sell the asset.  So, why not hold long term and pay a low tax, and not bother with tax evasion jail time?

Despite being communist, China suffers from bureaucracy.  There is no decision maker who can pull the trigger on something like "let's control Bitcoin".  If it's even on the political radar right now it's buried in an economics bureau that's dealing with more pressing questions like "what should we do with our $1 Trillion USD cash holdings" or "why is our growth rate slowing".
Besides, only ~5% of transactions are in CNY right now.  Nothing to get worked up about, at all.  They may have a billion people, but they are per capita quite poor - $6k/year income.

If you intend to buy as a speculative investment, and intend to hold very long term (e.g. 10+ years), then don't put in enough money that you'll worry about what happens to it in the short term.  Does losing $5k in a day freak you out?  That's a pretty standard 10% movement.  That anxiety will prevent you from riding the inevitable and enormous bumps, and that anxiety will also cause you to sell early if it does grow.   
The flip side is also cause for alarm.  Imagine that being worth 100K in a month if it doubles; will you sell?  That defeats your original intention.

Don't worry, you're not the first person on the internet to confuse large numbers.  
Let's say that 100% of the total BTC market was owned by US taxpayers, who all love to cash out and pay taxes legally, and that they could liquidate 100% of the holdings at the total market cap (i.e. everyone could sell for the max) then if BTC was fully mined (21mm) and worth $100,000 USD EACH, you're talking about a 2.1 Trillion $USD market cap.  
For comparison that's almost twice what USD has in circulation right now (
Then, if everyone cashed out at short-term capital gains rates (~30%, higher than long term), that'd pay the gov't a cool 630 Billion.  With a B.
Now, for the scale, maybe in a way you can relate to:  A millimeter is a million, a meter is a billion, and a kilometer is a trillion.  That BTC capital gains tax bill yields about .6 kilometers in a race that's almost 17 Kilometers.  The debt is 16+ Trillion with a T. 
BTC $1mm/each?  Now we're talking!
I don't want to discount, though, that if BTC ever got to $100,000 it would be 'responsible' for a great amount of economic activity beyond its intrinsic net worth, and one would hope that US companies get ahead of the curve and "own" a lot of the bitcoin innovation similar to how the US has "owned" a lot of the internet innovation.  That'd be good for everyone, and if it created a few million jobs, *that* tax base would help with our Debt problem bigtime...
