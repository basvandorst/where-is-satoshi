European sizes and American sizes are different, so maybe Asia follows another different size chart. The real question is why is it categorized under color?

Except 99% of the world does not use bitcoin and is not going to use bitcoin because of a random sandwich shop.

Apple created the fucking computer dude that’s not even a comparison.

That’s not what I said. Do you have eyes? Do you understand the English language? I said the ONLY WAY accepting a card would hurt their business is if they were falsifying their cash income. If Europe is like you said and most people use money and not cards, then the 2.75% fee would only apply to the “few” people who are using cards, people that probably wouldn’t be buying a sandwich if they didn’t accept cards.

Not once did I ever say he should go to jail nor did I say I cared if they WERE money laundering. Man, you’re really dumb.

So all of America? Why wouldn’t you be able to use a CC? Why wouldn’t that make the business run well?

Yeah because EU is known for making great business decisions. Get a damn square reader. 2.75% charge on swipes. Only 2.75% of the price a sandwich to not turn down customers without cash. HOW is that possibly a bad business decision unless they’re laundering money?

Cards are not a promise of money. The money is automatically given to their bank account. If it’s a debit card, it’s taken from the customer’s bank account and placed into the store’s bank account. If it’s a credit card, it’s taken directly from the bank and placed into the store’s bank account, then the customer must pay back the bank. Nobody is saying they NEED to take card. You don’t NEED to take a card in the US either, they just chose to because it’s foolish for business not to.

It’s kind of hard to go to court when you’re hiding from prosecution
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:42:11
You’re both bringing up moot points. Like you said, how do we know he’s a rapist if he’s never been to court for it? But also, how do we know he’s not a rapist if he’s been hiding from the courts? The only thing we know is that he was accused of rape.

It looks scary but it’s just a shotgun, pretty sure you can get shotguns in the UK with a license.
@_date: 2018-07-29 00:54:34
I never said it wasn’t a fancy shotgun :p

You’re not really supposed to leave them laying around here either,  but the police wouldn’t really know if it’s out or not and they’d probably be pretty lenient knowing he was being physically threatened.

Wasn’t the issue back then that the representatives weren’t actually representing the citizens rather than political and monetary interests...?.........but then again that does nothing to change the end results grab the pitchforks.

They reference FinCEN, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which regulates money laundering and other suspicious activities.
Not accusing you of anything, and if you were in fact doing something along those lines of suspicion, obviously don’t talk about it here, but it sounds like they suspected you of suspicious activities and are locking your funds for investigation.
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:41:21
Yes, if they investigate and find that you did nothing wrong (which is entirely possible), then it will be solved and you will presumably get your bitcoin back.
The only thing you can really do now is try to elevate a support ticket to someone who knows what they’re talking about.
