I think it is hilarious that the subreddit for BCH actually uses BTC, which is with absolutely no doubt a lie in itself. A1 scam.

and then it goes down to 30% again. BUT THEN...

Not necessarily. Obviously, you are only diversifying within the crypto space. But that is like buying houses in different cities, you are diversifying, but only within your market segment.
Also, one example that comes to my mind because I own some would be ravencoin. There has been little correlation between raven and bitcoin prices.

As an addition: never put in something you might need within the next few years. Having your emergency fund invested is a terrible idea, because that stupid car always breaks down right before a pump.

Very solid advice, can be applies to most things in life tbh. Make your own decisions, that way even if the decisions are terrible you can learn from your mistakes and make better decisions in the future.

But really it cost you less than $150. Always look at the positive side!

That is not at all unreasonable, sometimes a good decision turns into a terrible one by pure chance.

probably a written instruction in a safe place that your loved ones will definitely look at in the event of your death? I don't know, maybe a bank deposit box? I realize that trusting a bank with your valuable information is... not exactly in the spirit of bitcoin, but I can't think of a better way unless you happen to have a safe at home.
Perhaps a server that you are constantly running, that will send a mail to who ever you would want the information to reach, which will automatically send that mail if it has not received a special message from you within the last 30 days, kind of like a dead man switch? Technically possible, but whoever you decide to host it with will have access to the data in theory. idk that idea is very out there i guess \^\^

I bought a bunch at under 4k, not the absolute lowest point but reasonably close. Quite happy with that

True. buying yesterday looked like terrible timing, but anyone who bought in yesterday is already almost 20% up.

I can only keep Crypto in my wallet for this if I know that cashout with crypto and payment with crypto is basically the same volume, otherwise it's a huge hassle to keep the wallet full enough.
If you think I should knowingly sacrifice 95%+ of my customerbase just to go full crypto, you are delusional.
I am absolutely rooting for bitcoin, which is why I want my customers to be able to pay with it in the first place. I am doing my part in creating a cryptofriendly future, in which a business purely run on bitcoin might actually work.
By going full 'Crypto or nothing' you make it seem more like a cult than anything else to unsuspecting newcomers, and are certainly not helping Bitcoin gaining world wide acceptance.
Only siths deal in absolutes after all.

Since most bank accounts are not free, you are not sending money for free.
