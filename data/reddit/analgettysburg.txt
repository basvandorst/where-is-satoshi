Because they care about losing money
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:33:40
No, trades still incur 0.25% fees. You can withdraw Bitcoin to an external wallet 30 times in a month, and Gemini will pick up the tab for the network fees to that
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:08:59
I agree with the too much sentiment. If you can get them direct, it can be fine. Otherwise you're likely to not make a return on your initial investment over the miners lifetime.
Remember, with a miner, you're getting money every month. With using that money to just purchase Bitcoin, you're subject to the whims of the market. In this market, it's better to buy Bitcoin. In a down/sideways market, it's often better to buy the miner
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:41:38
Right now it is, yes. Mining is a lower-risk way to obtain value than buying Bitcoin, though it captures less of the upside

Right, but my point is that they make a steady income, rather than allocating the purchase price to Bitcoin, where their income is at the whims of the market

Gemini is my go to. They have been down quite a bit recently though :( it seems to have settled now that futures are live, but you never know
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:53:51
That will be different from the miner fee, I'd bet (they might cover the miner fee, but I seriously doubt it). If you look at your gemini account for a specific BTC withdrawal, you should see a number slightly bigger than what your wallet shows it received. This difference between what you sent and what you received will be the fee you paid to the network so that it would process your transaction. I use gemini myself, though I haven't bought anymore in a few weeks so I can't pinpoint exactly where it would show you the fee

BTC and ETH will probably see the most stable growth over time. I also hold some ADA, which is the project that one of Ethereum's founders began after the DAO hack. They lean to the side of 'code is law' (which I agree with), and will be using proof of stake when mainnet goes live Q2 2018 :) I like having exposure to POW in Bitcoin, the hybrid in Ethereum and POS in Cardano (ADA).
IOTA is also interesting, for their approach of the tangle (though they've been seeing some issues with it recently)

They've gone down by a ton again. The network attack is over
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:21:58
The tradeoff is that their UI is less friendly, and that a coinbase account gives you access to GDAX, which has 0 fees if you're a market maker. There's a reason to use GDAX over Gemini, but unless you're a complete rookie there isn't really a reason to use Coinbase over either option

It actually turns out I was incorrect. Gemini has it ready to go, but hasn't turned it on yet. Basically though, segwit transactions take up less space than normal ones, so the amount spent on each transaction is much lower

If they dumped all their shares at once, the market would not be able to absorb them at the present value. They would have to accept lower bids in order to offload them. That's what I'm saying. And that's why they wouldn't offload all their shares at once
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:31:37
You won't see them suggesting you invest in gold, either. The typical 'safe' play for investors is to lend money to asset producers (whether by owning equity in a company, or purchasing debt issued by a company). Asset producing investments have a much higher likelihood of repaying debt (and generally a lot of assets too be liquidated in the case of insolvency). 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:58:05
GDAX limit orders are commission free; coinbase charges 1% I believe. Although they're run by the same company, they aren't the same product. I'm not sure about how much withdrawal fees are from either wallet, but the first 30 in a month are free on Gemini

You should be about to wire money into an exchange, which should help with the low transfer limits at least
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:23:05
It was at a high of like $160 yesterday, so yeah :) We all know that regular old bitcoin transactions are high relative to alts. With segwit wallets, you can bring it down quite a bit, but it's still going to be high... I mean, Bitcoin is the biggest of all the cryptos, so that much is obvious. The userbase has come pretty squarely behind scaling largely in sidechains, so you'll just have to sit on whatever bitcoin you own if you don't want to pay those fees until those scaling solutions are implemented

That's all well and good, but I'm talking about value, not transaction count. I acknowledge that other alts have cheaper transaction fees, and that you can't at the present time store cats on Bitcoin's blockchain

That's laissez faire market
@_date: 2018-10-22 13:41:25
They would probably have to do that, yes.
 Think about it from the perspective of mitigating risk; they don't want to take on the possibility that the buying party can't actually pay (so a bond is posted before the auction). They don't want to take on the risk that the exchange can't actually pay them even if the buyer had the funds (hello mtgox). They especially don't want to run the sale through an unregulated exchange (so basically all of them, maybe they could use Kraken or Gemini, but those are compliant from a legal perspective, not necessarily an honest market perspective). 
It would likely be the same for any non-dollar assets seized, and not necessarily particular to Bitcoin

A lot of the centralization occurred because the asic tech was iterating so fast that a huge chunk of each unit's value was lost in the time it took to ship them from manufacturer (China) to end user (the west in general). A lot of the manufacturers just ended up parking the Asics in factories beat them for a few months until most of their depreciation had already occurred, then ship them out. 
This all happened because the manufacturing processes were improving faster than Moore's law, I'm order to catch up (essentially) with regular semiconductors. As of 2016, they're basically at the limit, and will begin to only improve as fast as regular tech. This means less of an advantage of plugging them in near the factory, and more of an advantage to shipping them out quickly.
I'm the next years, we'll likely see a wave of general decentralization in mining, as competent ASICs get into consumer's hands before obsolescing

Net neutrality was defacto until a few years ago, when Verizon sued to not have to follow it any more. The great internet build out occurred when providers were following neutrality.

They could dethrone BTC, in favor of BCH. But, they could just as easily do the opposite. Judging by the fact that those funds haven't been touched in years though, I think it's more likely that they just either don't care enough to do anything, are dead, or have somehow lost access to the funds. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:31:32
I don't think the operator of a particular node matters, so long as that operator has to follow the same rules as everyone else. You wouldn't disagree to sending your Bitcoin to a bank, or buying Bitcoin from a bank, for example, so long as you know they're following the same rules as the whole network. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:51:00
Running your own node allows you to self-verify that your transactions have occurred. This secures your own holdings, at the very least. 
On-chain scaling is directly tied to the block size increase. So, while not every block will be 8 MB, that they can be means that they'll get as close to that as possible as new users arrive. It only maintains the decentralization of BTC so long as it remains small, and as soon as it grows it will run into these problems. 
The security of the BTC blockchain will not scale to lightning until transactions are settled, true. But that is the point of it. We maintain an incredibly secure decentralized database for the major moves, but worry less about the smaller ones. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:53:58
Sort of. All ultimate transactions would be recorded on the blockchain, but the intermediate would have to be settled based on prior knowledge. You can think of lightning as something more akin to  a prepaid debit card, or a bank account, if you will. The brilliant part of it is that if either party tries to close the channel early, the counter party takes both stakes
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:07:16
Simply put, probably smaller off-chain (more local, less global) solutions such as Lightning Network. This has the added benefit (or not, depending on whom you ask) of giving Bitcoin a pseudo proof-of-stake solution, for those who want to make Bitcoin with Bitcoin, as opposed to with outside resources (electricity). 
LN has been under development for a while, but tests are starting to look very promising :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:33:43
Sure you could have credit companies, why not? The question is: is Bitcoin the best technology if you want those the rest of it?
I'd look into ethereum, and the concept of smart contracts in general if I were you. That would be a better platform to host such things
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:42:04
Which currency is as decentralized as Bitcoin, and has lower fees? Honestly curious
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:15:32
It is. Shapeshift has integration with a few wallets (I think Jaxx is another). Changelly is there too, if that's the route you'd like to go
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:32:44
You would need the seed, which might actually be what you saved as your password (if you're very lucky)
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:47:02
It takes twice as much space to store 2 mb as it does to store 1, which means the size (in MB) of the blockchain will grow twice as fast. 
I don't mean poor as in "has Twitter on their phone," I mean poor as in "barely has a phone." 
Bitcoin has value because basically anyone with a hard drive built semi-recently (think past ten years) and an internet connection can download the entire blockchain and verify every single transaction that ever happened on the network. The trade offs you're seeing are because the thing that won't bend is this need for self verification by almost anyone. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:18:27
I see. I was confused by your response to my question. I think Bitcoin is incredibly resistant to centralization going forward (as I explained in my other responses here). 
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:29:20
It's block size is much larger (8 MB max, as opposed to 1 MB for Bitcoin), which would lead to centralization of nodes into a few hands, as opposed to the very wide net that Bitcoin currently enjoys. If you believe that decentralization is the key feature of Bitcoin (and there's not really a reason to be here if you don't believe that), then this is a problem and makes BCH forever inferior to BTC. 
However, if you believe that fast, cheap transactions are the key feature of Bitcoin (and there are many here who no doubt believe that), then BTC is currently inferior to BCH. 
It should be noted that there are protocol and software fixes in the pipeline which will no doubt rectify BTC's current costs. However, the only thing which could lead to a continued decentralization of BCH is an improvement in storage and network space. 
The difference between these two is that BTC's improvements will be internal to its system, whereas BCH's improvements require changes which are external to its system. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:26:14
Bitcoin is open source man, you can submit a BIP and it'll be taken into consideration. If you don't like Bitcoin enough to stay, go get into an alt coin that you like and try to help it grow :)

A hardware wallet is worth it if losing the amount of Bitcoin you own would be a problem for you, financially. Other than that, store it on your phone in a wallet which is open source (I use coinomi, which happens to not be, but it has a lot of nice features which I like). If someone is about to steal your Bitcoin, it'll be because of a security problem on your phone, not a problem with Bitcoin itself. So, there's no real need to split it up between wallets.
All that said, a paper wallet is the most secure way to store Bitcoin, because the seed and wallet address are created offline and never touch the internet at all. If you go this route, make sure you 'sweep' the whole paper wallet into an electronic one whenever you remove any amount of Bitcoin from it though!
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:30:54
Basically, what would happen is that people would exchange usdt for usd instead, and the people that currently hold tether would be kind of screwed (though the exchanges would probably honor it?). The only reason tether exists is to let people think they're avoiding the tax man. By exchanging one crypto for another, the theory is that, since you never exited to dollars, you haven't actually realized any of your capital gains. This is probably false, and easily mucked with by those who could then 'realize' capital losses by going to USD, but let gains slide by going to usdt. 
Basically, if it burned down, I think people would be hodling more, but nothing else would change. Probably we'd take a price hit, as very few investors in Bitcoin know how it works, nor how taxes on investments work.

I think it was about as centralized a year or so ago as it will ever be. Antonopolous talks about the Chinese centralization a bit, and you can look at his videos for a more in depth look, but basically it's not economically fortuitous for the miner manufacturers to run their products for months before sending them to consumers anymore. It had been when chip density was increasing faster than Moore's law, but at the current 16nm fabrication we've basically caught up to the leading edge of chip development, and it's slowing down a lot. 
This means that end users have been getting miners which are competitive with the big farms for about a year now.

Basically, the size of the BCH block chain would grow at 8 times the speed of the BTC blockchain. So, every day, instead of devoting 144 megs of disk space to storing it, you'd need to set aside 1.15 gigs. This means that you will need to upgrade your storage capacities for BCH 8 times for every 1 you'd need to do so for BTC. 
This vastly faster upgrade times prices out many people who might be able to run the BTC blockchain without issue. Anytime someone is priced out, that's one less node existing, which centralizes the nodes a little more.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:24:27

@_date: 2017-11-10 03:30:57
The threat to security is that if we increase block size from 1 MB to 2 right away, then the blockchain will grow twice as fast, and price out some of the poorer nodes (who can't afford to keep buying new discs to compensate) faster. Now, that said, at 1 MB blocks you could still be pricing out the poorest people... but that's part of design; you make sacrifices and hope you sacrificed just enough to make it work.

Assuming he moved from BTC to ETH at the BTC high, ETH increased in value (which he then held) against BTC (which he didn't). This disparity was widest when BTC was lowest, and he swapped back.

Yeah. My confusion me to some random thread on stack overflow, where I found that answer. Oh well. You did an excellent job with it, and keep up the good work :)

I don't know much about Bitcoin's current developers, but I'd be willing to bet it's because they're human beings like the rest of us.

The test being Bitcoin testnet? As for monero, an adaptive blocksize doesn't bode well for decentralization. Sure, some blocks will be smaller. But the bigger the adoption, the larger the blocks, the more drive and ram space needed to run a full node.

It seems to be a difference in priority. BCH proponents are more interested in low fees than in decentralization. BTC proponents are more interested in decentralization than in low fees. 
I'm obviously on the side of decentralization, but that isn't to say there aren't good reasons to go BCH. Oh course, most of those reasons are negated by the existence of venmo and PayPal...

If after 3 days the transaction has not confirmed, then it is dropped from the network and you can access your coins again. Right now, your transaction is awaiting confirmation from the miners, and it's important to remember that in the worst case scenario, it does not get picked up and your Bitcoin is yours again

A lot of the hashing power is centralized to a (comparatively) few companies, many of whom were signaling that they would switch to mining S2X instead of BTC. If too much of the hashing power left regular Bitcoin, it would be difficult for it to make the two weeks to the difficulty readjustment. It would take a crazy long amount of time to mine each block during those first two weeks, and many users would likely switch, out of frustration

Lol well fuck me :) I spent so goddamn long on those files!

More Bitcoin were sold than were bought. If you want to go into technical analysis, we're just exiting a very long descending triangle (the exits of which are often sharp and violent). The crypto market as a whole is largely dictated by bitcoins  moves, too, which is why you often see all coins mirroring one another's directional movements

R/bitcoindiscussion was stated as a way to mediate between the two. Unfortunately, it's definitely fallen off in the past few months
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:58:44
Yeah this was my point. Apologies to the above commenter if I confused them. I guess a better way to frame to frame it would be that more Bitcoin are looking to be sold at these levels than are looking to be bought at these levels.

I'm looking at the tether order book working right now on Poloniex

It is exactly that. However, that doesn't mean that it's worth your investment. Segwit is pretty cool, honestly!

Invite your friends and get paid more = pyramid scheme

I agree the over 6k figures we were seeing were a case of it being overbought. However, one cycle of overbuying does not mean that it is forever doomed. This is a natural cycle which all securities go through as the market acts upon them.

It still needs to be in your control at the time of the fork snapshot, my dude :)

He's joking

You could point to literally anything as evidence that awareness has "potentially topped out." 
More people getting involved in Bitcoin only brings more value to the table.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:10:20
No way. We failed to break above the $11,700ish barrier on many different occasions, and people got spooked by it. The ledger thing isn't even even a drop in the bucket

Gemini is really quite excellent. There are fees for both makers and takers, but it's so much lower than coinbase it's crazy. GDAX is pretty good from what I've heard as well

People saving money was hurting the economy (saving here meaning not investing). By saving, you decrease the amount of money in circulation, which messes with the value of that currency (a smaller amount of money chasing the same amount of goods). 
By paying for things in Bitcoin you are increasing the circulation, and so making the currency more liquid. This allows more goods to be exchanged. Further, if you want to pay in Bitcoin instead of $ you can just take the dollars you would have spent and turn them right into Bitcoin again, covering your investment. It's a little more work, but the idea is to transact entirely in BTC eventually. If you really believe in that, you should rarely be exchanging it for Fiat. 
(That said, we're a long way away from that future!)

They will always be on the blockchain, regardless of whether you store them in a paper wallet or digital wallet. The only difference is that with a paper wallet there is no chance (or vanishingly small chance) of a hacker getting your private keys and accessing your coins
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:03:54
Any amount of Bitcoin you control will carry over to the new fork

Not an expert on their service, but do you have access to your private keys through them? They look at a glance like any of the other exchange based wallets
