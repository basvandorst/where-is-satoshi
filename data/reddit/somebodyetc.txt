There is almost some sense in what you write. But there is a philosophical problem perhaps you can dissaude me on? Crypto coin isn't a currency for many reasons including the fact its value --- which is primarily if not solely based on the expectation some major Central bank will make their own --- flucuates way too much. So at the moment it's really an alternative payment system like a credit card involving more middle man fees to get into it and back to fiat currency. No serious company like amazon or Walmart can do payroll or capex with crypto coin ... Even if they had their own. So until Central banks adopt this ..  then this alt coin can't really proceed.

Re 2: either you're not reading and understanding my point or you're failing to counteract my argument: crypto coin isn't currency I keep telling you. Sure in the trivial sense it's called currency by crypto enthusiasts it is. But that's like a moron who tries to convince you that eating the menu is the same as eating the meal because it models food. No it isn't!! I remain firm that the best thing to happen to cyrpto coin is if a central bank comes up with their own version. The volatity in BC stems primarily from the fact it's a fad, the hope it'll be well accepted by regulatory bodies  to make it really legit, or the belief that it can overpower fiat currency. All these are high risk outcomes founded mostly in belief/expectation. Unlike an equity asset with accounting in real currency with income, costs, taxes, capex, sales numbers which grounds the value if the asset in a grounded way, the btcusd conversion rate has no basis in real world valuation. I continue to believe the block chain is the part that'll be adopted for sure.
Re 3: the white paper is a fine read for technical aspects. But not as a policy for widespread use in a mature economy. World powers have come on, off, and back on to paper or gold standards to deal with inflation or deflation and it's connections to debt, credit interest rates, and bank runs. What happens if some guy wants a hard fork, or decides screw it I want 1,000,000,000 coins not 21MM ... I think it's quite niaeve to think this is consequence free on a widely used blockchain ... Subject matter experts who are planning for stable economies I think would do this better. 
Re 4: gold confers distinction because it's and industrial metal, used for jewelry, was the first and longest used store of value and trading unit of payment in human existence (with silver, copper, and diamonds). Strictly speaking it could have been something else say platinum. And theoretically cyrpto coins could do this ... It can model gold in a computer ... But market acceptance of any real currency depends on intangibles like government support, control of inflation/deflation, stable interest rates, country indebtedness, and so on. Take for example the Yuan: here's a case of an alternative to USD that's trying to supplant USD and become a world reserve currency. But even China finds that an extremely difficult proposition. How much more for cyrpto coin 
In summary I think what's missing here is for an economist to weigh in on what crypto coins would need to do in a system of economics not the point issues of payment, crypto,

According to what I read a strong possibility is the miners in China use an asic chip with an algorithm that allows them to mine 20pct faster than without, sometimes making empty blocks something that segwit and larger blocksizes would disable ie. good old fashioned greed and a power play possible because of the outsized concentration of Chinese mining in BTC.

I think there's some sense that. The concept that a person's transaction could be visible to anybody, even pseudo anonymous, I think is a bit too far for the public at large. And who'd want to be stuck mining a substantial amount of the US' transactions ... That alone would likely attract only a small number of powerful miners --- assuming some proof of work prevails --- thereby putting another bullet in the original bitcoin vision.

If you're a Doonesbury fan, you may know an old strip going back to the Walden days when the kids were young and life was easy and morals and ethics we're high: no kids, mortgages, boss, divorce, no work grind. In this flashback Mike D. was working on a protest sign reading some like "I've got problems with X" ..  I forgot what X was. Anyway zonker asks Mike how it's going and mike says: I'm kind of stuck. How can I show in a short sentence that while I've got some problems, I don't prefer the exact opposite. That's me: I have interest in this coin and chain big time especially the chain part. My personal guess is where 10 years off a central bank going crypto with oced enconmies coming in last.
I anticipated your reply on the hard fork ..  sure in a narrow sense who cares if one moron goes rouge. But I think a real currency has to be far more solid than that... Something a central bank could manage. And economists will have to understand how this coin would interact within the larger economy.
Thank you for an interesting back and forth.

@_date: 2018-01-23 23:23:43
Totally agree. Even a vendor like amazon --- even if had amazon coin --- would only use it if and only if they could immediately exit it for fiat currency. Basically crypto coin amounts to a glorified in store poker chip or in store credit ... Basically an alternative payment system. And in order (reasonably assuming amazon would have huge income in alt-coin) to exit the surplus of crypto coin for fiat would come with middle man charges the customer would have to eat. So in sum it amounts to or is analogous to credit cards: it'll implicitly increase the cost of purchases some fraction or a few percent.
And it'd force amazon to support pricing in the coin as with a spot exchange ...and because of the voliatility it would further complicate things. Hell at that point pay with a debit or credit card ...

The twaddle that passes for normal on this thread is disconcerting.
- is not a good store of value
- are not the units anybody for every intent and purpose prices things in
- isn't widely accepted
So it's not currency.
It's a poor payment system too. Its been hacked numerous times. Now fiat currency has been stolen way more but cash never made claims on crypto safety. Gemini halted trading at least 20 times often multiple times in the same day in December because blockchain was excessively slow.
A vast majority of mining is done by relatively few players. So that's centralized yet another fly in the BC ointment.
The USD/BTC exchange rate therefore is almost down to pure speculation.

@_date: 2018-01-22 02:09:40
Hey moron. Look up the definition of a currency in an economic textbook and see the kinds of roles, responsibilities it has to satisfy.
Tweedle Dee and tweedle dum who exchange bc with or without dinner isn't a currency. Now you can try to argue it may be a currency, should be one etc. That's cool. But it sure in the hell isn't one now. It's also a crappy payment system hardly better or worse than credit cards: some alternative middle man payment system replete with fees.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:57:01
Are you serious? Why do we have a central bank? I think you not me need to research out as an exercise to self the roles and responsibilities of the central banks with primary banks on money supply, treasury, inflation control etc.. The US monetary system is one of largest, deepest, most liquid best integrated market (credit and debt) out there in which for one thing the use and value of USD is an undisputed good, practical, and useful thing. Central banks help make that go everyday.
Meanwhile crypto isn't even a currency having nothing to do with the fact it's new or not. 
The example of gold also goes nowhere: the value of gold is a metal that can mined, used almost like cash and whatever it else it may be, it's certainly not a virtual made-in-software-thing with no underlying and intrinsic economic value. 
Finally, the dream event -- the absolute crowning achievement of cyrpto coin --- is or would be precisely a central bank saying they're making their own crypto coin and block chain. That more than anything else would make it legit. Deal with it!

You are way overstating the case and, furthermore, implying a bad that CC companies protect their market. Just as Intel or Boeing or proctor and Gamble protect theirs. CC have power because consumers like the service they provide. It's called competition. Blaming structural bias is really just saying crypto can't compete. That's not the CC's problem.
Two, CC companies didn't try to sell their service as a conceit to replace currency like crypto tries.
I worked at a credit company: charge backs and vendor/customer disagreements about money are considerable.

The internet was a new innovation. Bitcoin in contrast is an attempt to replace fiat currency, credit cards, wire transfers, checks with a virtual currency. Since only states and the Federal government can decide what a fiat currency is bitcoin's goal is woefully short sighted. And putting aside the trivial definition of currency as the exchange of a good or service between a insignificant number of counterparties eg. buying coffee with bitcoin, Bitcoin fails all practical tests of a practical currency: its value flucutates too much; an overwhelming number of goods and services are not priced in bitcoins, and Bitcoin is not a widely circulated currency. Surfing information or opinion on the internet is a far different scenario from replacing numerous , robust existing solutions which bitcoin cannot be better than. Merely competing with newspapers online is hardly the same goal as replacing USD say in the US.
My guess is blockain however will be important for chain of ownership concerns. That I can see.

Agree. Econimists care about things like currency. No fed officer, bank, economist believes crypto coin is currency in any realistic sense - just because some insignificant trades are done in crypto does not a currency make. So why kill it? I'm in trading; it's not clear to me yet how crypto is any more efficient over all with POW. In fact it is more bytes and more cycles. Block chain may be useful for ownership proof. And things like stellar may be good only insofar as it lowers cost for money xfers, however, note again lumens have no use as currency and are not a currency. So lumens are an implementation detail in sending, like banks, Fiat currency which is all people ever cared about anyway. One significant exception may be small countries whose central Bank authors their own and whose population uses cash less and less. Sweeden is an example. But not for USD or Yuan.

Omg you are a true believer type. Well to paraphrase a noted writer, disbelief isn't the main problem. Belief is. See you later!!!!!

Meanwhile ... You need a degree and having come from math into CS I can tell you if you don't have a CS degree you can't do paxos, clang compilers, and many many many vital areas of work. Know the down sides too. How are you going to write kernel code or a HA db without a CS degree? Forget it.

Bc Not fiat.

What utter BS op. There's plenty of politics between users and miners right now. Moreover bc isn't currency , is no where close to same, any by attaching yourself desperately to a situation with actual relevance does not make you relavent.

The internet was innovation that didn't require or demand or be considered successful by the wholesale replacement of something it didn't control.
Bc does. Bc isn't currency. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 04:26:59
If bc took all they money spent on hype and marketing ... Heck ... That's a lot of money ...

Cheap symbolism OP.   
Meanwhile fiat currency isn't about rebel-without-a-cause. And until you realize that for all intents and purposes the scope of BC usage is tantamount to guys buying coffee BC will be continue to be relegated to anarchists who always have an axe to grind.
But hey you're exercising your 1st amendment rights ... so that's something I guess.
@_date: 2018-12-30 21:21:56
cause they want your cash dumbass. that's it. that's all.
@_date: 2018-12-22 04:25:55
Maybe. But they can fork, change the code, blocksize, or number of coins if it's a fed run thing. Oh well.

Proof? 
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:49:21
jeez ... op ... you don't get it.
either,  
(1) bitcoin/blockchain in fiat doesn't want to be regulated but it will be if the government gets involved up to and including forks ...  
(2) or the government won't allow it
both work against long standing  bitcoin/blockchain aims.
moreover the fact that printing money can't be apart of bitcoin/blockchain (which means forking) ... is another reason bitcoin/blockchain is day dreaming. dealing with real, mature financial markets can't be reconciled to bc. bc isn't a currency in anyway that counts ... the fact there's some trivial retail of guys buying coffee etc. does not a fiat replacement make.
so all that's left is stupid reddit memes. big deal
