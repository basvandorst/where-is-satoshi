If you have the time, have a look at the Norwegian foundation [EmmaSofia]( working for drug policy reform, harm reduction, psychedelic therapy and proving the human right to access altered states. The organization was founded by among others, researchers Teri Krebs and Pål-Ørjan Johansen, known for their meta studies proving the long term benefits of these types of compounds.

What about combining EMDR therapy with MDMA? Do you think that would be effective?

What if I want to do my own web browser mining?

Still can't?

Please explain. I can currently choose between heating my home with electricity for $X/kWh, or burn biofuel for X*1.25/kWh. Everybody tells me to install a heat pump to save money. Why not? We're not discussing physics in a closed system. The outdoor air is constantly moving around here and the current temperature is about -4 degrees. Neighbors all have heat pumps buzzing, while I'm burning oil.

I meant efficient use of money. Below -25 degrees Celsius, you might as well turn on your regular heater.

A heat pump can generate heat equivalent to 4 kW with 1 kW of power input.

No, read about [coefficient of performance]( on Wikipedia. Excerpt from the example: "*A geothermal heat pump operating at a COP (heating) of 3.5 provides 3.5 units of heat for each unit of energy consumed (i.e. 1 kWh consumed would provide 3.5 kWh of output heat).*"
 
It's not creating heat, it's simply "moving" the heat energy from the outdoor air to the inside. This method is still efficient down to outdoor temperatures around minus 25 degrees Celsius.
