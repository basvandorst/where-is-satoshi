Removes freedoms from the individual? Man if what we earned was based off of what we give to the community, and the worth of our efforts was measured by what the people themselves have said society needs, rather than by what a minority of wealthy individuals has decided they want, most men would have far more freedom. Sorry if that was poorly worded, it was kind of rushed. I'd be willing to have a more in depth conversation about the topic though on Skype, kik, steam or snapchat

Marx advocated for capital and the means of production to be controlled by the class that sells or provides their labor. State officials are therefore not proletarians, which is why Engels advocated for the destruction of the state.

I'm fine with being an asshole if it would yield a future where we produce enough food and do only as much work as we need to.
But yeah, it would suck if violence was the only way we could get there

Who said we weren't gonna force them to, if a transitional state is needed then whatever. The point is if the socialization of the means of production is successful, we end up with way more workers than dipshit bourgeoisie
