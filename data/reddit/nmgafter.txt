Because its issuance is not 100% decentralized, Ethereum will require a money transmitter license in every jurisdiction in which it is operated. The developers and creators who get some premined amount will be subject to legal and political pressure under existing laws, and can be jailed if the currency is used for money laundering by other people. If you intend this to be a long-term thing, you need to get yourselves professional legal advice ASAP before the launch.

Your scenario doesn't really make sense... "what if bitcoin becomes so valuable that it becomes worthless?" The value of a bitcoin is the price (however high or low) at which you can buy and sell it. It is either valuable or worthless, but not both at the same time.
How can bitcoin becomes "so valuable" and yet hard to acquire? Since a bitcoin is divisible down to the 100,000,000th part, there are plenty of satoshis to go around.
Adoption of another cryptocurrency doesn't really effect the value of bitcoin. It is the adoption level of bitcoin that affects bitcoin's value.
Assuming one day gold becomes quite scarce and sought after, what is to stop people who 'missed out' from adopting an alternate metal and rendering the value of gold useless?

Price does not follow difficulty.  The economics of the situation are the other way around.
As the price rises, it becomes more profitable to mine so more miners are added to the network, causing an increase in difficulty.  As the price falls, mining becomes less profitable so less profitable mining operations stop, causing a decrease in difficulty.

If you buy bitcoins and then later use your bitcoins to purchase something, then whether or not that purchase is a taxable event in the USA (capital gains) depends on whether the IRS decides bitcoins are to be taxed like a foreign currency or taxed like a commodity.  If taxed like a foreign currency then a purchase is not a taxable event.  If taxed like a commodity then it is.  I believe the IRS has not decided yet which it is.

You should be using Bitcoin's native escrow system - the transaction to pay for the thing should use a 2-out-of-3 signature scheme - the payer's, the seller's, and yours.  If the payer and seller agree, they both sign a transaction to spend the sent coins and you need not be involved.  Only when there is a dispute would the parties seek your involvement (and pay you a fee).  It doesn't require anyone to trust you with funds.
If this isn't how you're planning to do it, your business model is not really compatible with the way Bitcoin is done, and you're not likely to see much uptake from the community.
Good luck.

A block appearing with a transaction doesn't make that transaction more "secure" than it was the instant before the transaction appeared in the block.  A fork block without that transaction appearing on the network is just as likely as (actually, more likely given that miners decide block contents) a double-spend transaction appearing on the network.  Litecoin's more frequent blocks add nothing to the security, and the lower resources dedicated to its mining compared to Bitcoin causes the security at a given wait time to be less.
But hey, use it if you like it.  There's every reason for the mall to prefer BTC to LTC, but if you can find something to do with your LTC, great.

You make a fatal assumption in your math - that all of these have to be distinct bitcoins.  People using bitcoin for micro transactions don't need to own them for very long.

The analysis is missing a crucial element.  It doesn't make sense that every miner after December (or any given time) will be operating at a loss.  Why would they continue operating if they are losing money?  Rational miners will turn off their mining rigs when their incremental cost of mining is more than the value of the mined bitcoins.
Who will be left?  Those with the lowest operating costs (e.g. power-efficient mining rigs and low electricity costs).  Their profit margin may not be huge, but they can continue operating at a profit.
When the global hash rate reaches the point where miners are barely marginally profitable, it levels off.  In the long run mining difficulty tracks the bitcoin-fiat exchange rate.  We're now in the transition period when mining is getting a lot cheaper.  The transition will not last forever.

Coinbase is very convenient for small purchases by US customers, though you do have to wait days to get your bitcoins.  Sending bitcoins from coinbase is not very reliable, though they're working on that (and have been for some time).
Coinbase charges 1% fees on both the buy and the sell side, and you have to buy/sell at the ask/bid.  Mtgox's largest fees are 0.6% on the buy side and 0% on the sell side, and that is quickly reduced when you trade in moderate volume.  On Mtgox you can place limit orders too.

There is one fatal flaw in this analysis.  They take the average fee and multiply by the trading volume to estimate mtgox's income.  That is off by a factor of two, because the fee is paid on both ends of a trade.  So if the fee is 0.5%, and the trade is for $100, each party pays a fee of $0.50, for a total fee of $1.00 or 1%.
If you correct this flaw in their analysis it would seem that mtgox does not have a liquidity problem.  But there are enough other variables that I do not feel confident in that conclusion.

It does not make sense to assume that miners will mostly run at a loss.  A rational miner will shut off his mining operation when the marginal costs of mining are greater than the marginal return in newly minted coins.  That means that only the most efficient mining operations will continue operating: those with the most efficient equipment (hash per second per watt) and the lowest electric prices.
Having said all that, I'm buying mining hardware because my electric costs ($0.026 per kwh) are lower than that for most miners.  That means that when other miners are running at a loss (and likely turn off their mining rigs), I will still be mining at a profit.  Of course it is important that I can earn at least my original investment in equipment and other fixed costs.

The difficulty will decrease at some time within the next year, but it may never be as low as it is now.

Paypal protects purchasers from fraudulent sellers at the expense of the sellers, and sellers pass these costs on to purchasers.
Bitcoin protects sellers from (chargeback) fraud of purchasers, and does so without incurring significant transaction costs.  It also creates the possibility of escrow systems, but a widely deployed escrow ecosystem will likely add transaction costs when buyers elect to use them.
It is easier to use the legal system to protect buyers than sellers because there are many more buyers than sellers and sellers generally need to make themselves available in order to continue to sell their products.  Therefore moving economic activity from paypal-like solutions to bitcoin is likely to reduce overall transaction costs.

I agree that existing fiat currencies are not likely to go away any time soon, but a more globalized alternative like bitcoin is very useful.
If any altcoins actually improved on bitcoin in any significant way, you'd have a point there too.

You cannot avoid using them, and that's a good thing. The security of your private keys no longer depends on the quality of the random number generator used when signing transactions.

I don't see how the law prohibits the usage of bitcoin by individuals to make purchases, as you say it does.  How do you read that into this law?

In order to fork the blockchain you need to have a way to distinguish. How will you know which blocks are the ones from miners that agree with you and which are from miners that disagree?

No. A share of stock represents fractional ownership of a corporation and, by extension, all of the corporation's assets.

Durable - A bitcoin requires no physical storage or maintenance. Gold does.
Divisible - A bitcoin is divisible into 10,000,000 units in milliseconds. Gold isn't.
Verifiable - A bitcoin can be verified in seconds. Gold cannot.

You can withdraw from mtgox *immediately* by paying a 5% fee, which is used to convert your cash into and then out of Yen in a complicated dance with the bank.  That is half of what you'd earn by arbitrage.

This doesn't make any sense. Why would Litecoin be resistant to coin loss at the same rate as Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:42:03
Because they have a power issue at full clock rate, and the power issue does not appear to be the chip itself.

"it is hard to imagine a world where the main currency is based on an extremely complex code understood by only a few and controlled by even fewer, without accountability, arbitration, or recourse."
Apparently they don't like the Federal Reserve or its Notes. By contrast the bitcoin code can be understood and modified by any one of the millions of people with programming skills.

At least they aren't discriminating against bitcoin.  Mtgox is now failing to process withdrawals in USD or BTC (for the past 24 hours).
