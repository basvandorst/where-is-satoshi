I cancelled all of my Visa cards. I transferred everything over to MasterCards! I'm trying to get my bank to switch from Visa to MasterCard and I've told them they'll lose a customer forever if they don't make the swap!

Depends on advertising revenue, assets, operating costs, projected earnings etc. Facebook owns Oculus, Instagram, physical property and much more. 
Not including their revenues: Facebook has $65 billion in assets, Netflix has $15 billion. 
Their valuations are not like the value of magic toy money. There’s only room for a little speculation on top.
If you want to compare valuations of real companies with real revenues and real assets against cryptos which have no revenues and no assets and often no incorporation, then you’ll make yourself look incredibly stupid. Don’t go there.

At least real companies have valuations based on real world product and activity. Get your engine wrong, price drops. Fix the problem, price rises.
How do you value Bitcoin? Well, it depends on how the miners feel today. If they feel like painting the tape, manipulating prices upwards or downwards, or cashing out big time.

The future will be glorious when atomic swaps and lightning arrives.
I’ll easily be able to convert my plasma phaser tokens to intergalactic moon credits without paying high fees and long waits. 
My Electrawallet tells me I have 0.678 starshells and I use my calculatron to see what the transtellar fee will be to send it to another galactacon. It tells me 0.8272 but when I teleport the tokens I only get 0.2201 asterdust on the other end which is less than the amount I paid when the ICO went live in Alpha Azuri web net. 
So I hit up Insurocoin for arbitration. I declare loss funds due to the rapid flux in the quantum exchange rate. They tell me yes the hashing algo of Madurocoin was incompatible with Legendbucks. This resulted in spooky action at a distance that oscillated between 20 and 30 frequencies per vibration and caused inordinate block sizes and massive memory pools.
They refund me 1.3 asterdust.

There is a fundamental problem and it was recognised decades ago.
A deflationary currency encourages by nature (you only need to look around here) hoarding. It reduces public spending and investments in property and stocks. It only takes a 5% reduction in public spending to cause substantial damage to the retail sector where profit margins are very very slim (average 5-6%). 
The first casualties would be small businesses. Corporations would fire people, streamline costs and raise profit margins. This would add cost to consumers. In fact, in a deflationary economy businesses raise prices faster than in an inflationary one. A movie Idiocracy parodied libertarian philosophy by showing us a glimpse of an unregulated world with trillion dollar lattes at Starbucks and a population who didn’t really understand the value of things anymore.
That’s why a controlled slightly inflationary economy is essential in high population developed regions.
Deflationary local currency could work In low population regions where development has been lagging, where they have less local spending and investments. But it would be a temporary developmental solution that would be carefully monitored for results.
A point people don’t realise it that “Satoshi” was against the hyper deflation bitcoin has experienced and it is easy find his comments against it. He wanted it to be affordable so it could be owned widely. He even said in case of hyper deflation he would attempt to create inflation by moving the decimal and changing the number of decimal places (as weird as it sounds it would be the only method available).

Easy to spy on, detect and record any type of communication or transaction. Don’t even need to be able to read the data. Even locations can be detected. Hash cash could be used to detect the location of a spam server back in the 90s.

They don’t print money out of “thin air”. Stop listening to crazy people like Ron Paul and try to study what backs money, how it enters the system, why controlled inflation is beneficial and all the reasons why money is removed from circulation.

A composite domain name wouldn’t be a violation. It’s when releasing a product or service that trademarks can be violated and that also depends on trademark categories. Ethereum Foundation hasn’t covered any categories outside of software.

Unfortunately that isn't the case. The hashrate follows the price. So as Bitcoin becomes more valuable the energy consumption increases. That’s before we talk about scaling the network up - which increases energy consumption too.
The ideal solution would have been that everyone has their own miner and they use the heat from that miner instead of their home central heating system. This way the energy usage is offset and there is little or no increase in carbon footprint.

The secret coins don’t have to hold value, but hypothetically they could launch it on a darknet and find enough users for it. They can even fool their darknet users into believing they are using the main Bitcoin chain. Users wouldn’t know the difference and it would cause chaos.
Even without the above, they can carry out sufficient scripted transactions on the secret fork and then spread news and evidence of what they are doing - that they created a fork without replay protection and are running transactions all day long. That’s negative news that spreads uncertainty and anger.
This is open source software and doesn’t come with insurance or restore from back up systems. It’s a massively tempting target.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:27:48
Banks don’t just do payments. The majority of their work is services - insurance, loans, mortgages, investments, business advice, market analysis, funds, etc. Some of that is being disrupted but it’s the banks themselves who have been doing it. P2P loans for example.
The payments and personal banking side has been downsizing and moving online for years. 
So if we compare like for like, payments, then debit cards are thousands of times more energy efficient and faster.

Money in a bank isn’t supposed to grow much otherwise people would spend and invest less. That’s not a good idea unless you want to see mass unemployment across the world. Profit margins are generally very tight in the retail sector (average 6%) and even a slight reduction in spending is very damaging.

No, the foolish attitude is that you want a deflationary currency and mass adoption as money.

And then there would be no Bitcoin as a commodity either.

@_date: 2017-11-05 16:40:14
The main chain would have to build protection into itself so that any new fork would be a clean break and there would be no duplication of the supply or replayed transactions. Might be too late for this.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:20:51
That’s too far off to make predictions and because we are seeing hundreds of cryptocurrencies being created, including forks of bitcoin, the scarcity of bitcoin and its value proposition has been diluted, lost and sabotaged. There’s no end to the creation of cryptocurrencies. This is not something “Satoshi” envisioned. He thought there would be just one digital currency and that uniqueness would make it special enough to be used globally (but remember that he called it a beta project). He was a young coder with no market experience so I can’t blame him for failing on several points, but he appears to have realised his failures in the last year he was socially active.

Bitcoin doesn’t enjoy any legal protection at the moment because it’s not a company, legal entity, or person and hasn’t been officially and universally declared an asset class yet. 
People can legally fork it (essentially counterfeiting every coin and account) or attack it because it’s an open source project with no ownership. So you can’t accuse them of criminal activity.

A deflationary crypto currency can’t replace national currencies. It can only be a payment option, a security or a commodity. This is a sustainable option that should make all parties happy, but unfortunately some people have zany political agendas and don’t want to listen to experience or basic economics.
There are very important reasons why a national currency has to be slightly inflationary. It means people spend, invest in stocks and property, build a pension, have an easier time trying to work out salaries, and are able to source manufacturing without the hassle of unpredictable rise in costs, etc
If the monetary supply was deflationary there would be more hoarding (and the wealthiest would keep getting wealthier), less investments in stocks and property, retail spending would be cut which would hit jobs and manufacturing, it would be harder to price products and the discount sales, and whoever pays your salary would want to pay you as little as possible even if your skills deserve more and won’t contribute to your pension.

It can be done.
- Ask the ISPs to stop nodes from syncing by detecting the connections. This can be done even electrically by detecting the signature of the transmission type. Encryption and darkwebs can’t hide these signatures.
- Outlaw exchanges and transfers from exchanges to banks
- Seize GitHub repositories 
- Create a secret fork to attack the main chain
The circumstances that would force these actions to take place would be if the cryptocurrency sector became an uncontrollably negative influence on the public and politics:
- if it caused crime to grow far beyond normal rates
- if it enabled demonstrably more terrorism/slavery than can be fought normally
- if it enabled even more political corruption than we already have 
- if continual scams hurt investors, families or the poor who are already in debt

He isn’t concerned. The finance sector has hundreds of analysts and investigators who are well aware that Bitcoin (and Ether) valuations include wash trading and run off from ICO scams. 
A mix of curiosity, uncertainty and complexity of converting back to cash means investment accumulates in the market even when someone would like to pull out. There are non-technical people who have bought into crypto and aren’t sure how to divest when they want to. That creates an accumulation in BTC’s market cap.
This year attracted a lot of media attention but also hoardes of scammers and pyramid schemes. Bitconnect’s MLM scheme is now being copied by others. In Asia and Africa crypto salesmen target the poor who don’t have computers. Guess who will be in charge of the private keys?
2018 will be a big test for cryptocurrencies. If enough Joe Public investors see lack of regulation, no insurance against theft, scams, the pump and dump groups, then they will pull their money out and they will not be quiet about their disappointments.

Anyone advocating deflationary currency has very little or no experience of industry, economics, business, manufacturing, wholesale, retail, etc. These tend to be keyboard warriors, literally, who don’t really understand the repercussions of their religious beliefs in bitcoin. Deflationary money reduces consumer spending and traditional investments in stocks, property, etc. Several things happen as a result of that. None of those outcomes are positive and some are catastrophic. 
At best crypto can be a commodity, at other times a security. In fact, if you want a traditional commodity such as gold (because you mentioned it) to rise in price all you have to do is increase the public demand for it. It’s accountable, easier to predict, can’t get hacked or lost, and doesn’t “fork”.

Sure, if there is a reason to such as bitconnect, pyramid schemes and ICO scams harm enough members of the public. This is happening but it will be in poor countries where we see the biggest impact of it. It takes very little to trigger a violent protest in poor communities and yet we see them being targeted by scams regularly now.
Actions could be:
- Developers and promoters arrested for creating shitcoins and pyramid schemes
- Law would require ISPs to block nodes from syncing or mining. This is easy and encryption can’t prevent it because electrical signatures are really easy to detect and decipher.
- GitHub repositories could be seized
- Websites seized
- Operating systems and app stores would black list wallet apps
- If needed tech firms and defence departments would be asked to attack blockchains. The amount of compute power owned by the biggest corporations makes crypto mining farms look insignificant.
- Power cut to mining farms

Thanks Vlad.
I’ll keep it brief.
Do we need 50 kinds of clothes stores? Well, in fact we should have hundreds or thousands of them. If you only have a few then there would be very little diversity in the designs, it would kill creativity, kill manufacturing jobs, cause the property market to collapse, really hurt the careers and education of many young designers/stylists/artists, and we would see an homogenisation of dress code. It would look like Mao’s China.
I’d like to see even more stores but less franchises and more local handmade customs and traditions returning. But note : those customs have very very tight profit margins because the cost and time for producing highly specialised garments is very high. That’s one of the reasons for their demise aside from access to quick cheap clothing. It’s also the reason why fashion designers will sell their small brand or work for a big company.
Retail is not just clothes of course. All the same above also applies to the great diversity of food we enjoy.
Do we need Toys R’ Us? Well that’s already been disrupted by gaming ;)

Deflationary currency is not a solution. 
The article above is about governments that can’t control inflation, either because they have inept people in charge or because their economies are maladjusted to changing times.
The real issue here is that certain nation states are hard to manage effectively. They should be “decentralising” certain sections of the economy to concentrate on building sustainable local communities who can’t be failed by inept national leaderships. This goes more for developing nations than developed ones.
Smaller communities could indeed use a locally introduced currency but it shouldn’t be deflationary otherwise pricing goods, salaries and services, and encouraging diverse investments is difficult and can be counter-productive.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:05:53
I don’t know how to do quotes on this so I’ll bulletin point.
- Retail profit margins have always been slim. There’s no way around this because from manufacturing to wholesale to retail, they are all in competition with each other and rent isn’t cheap either. That’s why certain businesses have to franchise or sell in very high volume or stash money offshore. 
- Why is the loss of retail a bad thing? I shouldn’t need to answer that. 100% of jobs in the world are dependent on it. It’s just another word for trading. Without trade people turn to violence, xenophobia, crime.
- People do sometimes spend frivolously but we have to bear in mind that they do so freely and it keeps a lot of people employed. What consumers should always aim for is ethical and sustainable goods. The goal should be that, so that everyone can enjoy the fruits of labour.
- Corporates shed deadweight all the time. If anyone wanted to fire people then corporates are experts at this and rarely need outsiders to instigate it.
- Development of small local populations can mean giving them a growing asset that in the future will help them invest into their community. Especially if they lack resources and produce to sell. A good example would be carbon credits or a deflationary basic income. The rich and developed regions don’t need this but the poorest do. It could certainly help mitigate illegal immigration and be used to protect the environment and local cultures.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:28:46
Value of clothing products doesn’t always depreciate (vintage, special editions, etc) and sometimes when it does that’s not a bad thing. You can pass them on to a sibling or charity. It’s irrelevant anyway because high end fashion is collected and increases in value, mid range tends to maintain value quite well, low end is supposed to be ‘for the masses’. 
The main issue, which is another discussion, is ensuring the use of sustainable and/or recyclable materials which the clothing industry has been embracing more and more.
Generally when I come across people who don’t understand the fashion trade and see it as unnecessary, those are outsiders who don’t see the underlying benefits globally. There are downsides too (sweatshop labour, etc) but people within fashion freely criticise that and make progress towards addressing those concerns daily. They aren’t sheepish.
I had drawn a parallel between the fashion and food industries but we should also include the technology sector in which the variety of brands, the product replacement rate, the trends, the new designs, and the advertising all mirror the business model in fashion. Hence the CEO of Burberry went on to Apple. 
As I said before, frivolous spending is certainly not something people should do if they can’t afford it. But it is a free choice and does create friendship between nations via trading. Investing in crypto can also be seen as frivolous by some. But it’s a free choice as long as it isn’t harmful to others.
We can safely say that consumerism (which is an aspect of free society) ended the cycle of warring states and imperialism that the world was used to non-stop for 5000 years. Now we have skirmishes, terrorist outbreaks, local disputes, but we don’t have full scale war because nations are locked into the same financial system. They buy each other’s debt, they invest in each other’s companies.
We can’t fix local skirmishes and terrorism without expanding trade. Milton Friedman, often seen as a free market hero of cryptocurrency users, was a staunch supporter of trade partnerships to end conflict.

You are overestimating what would happen if we get rid of all the advisors, analysts, economists, strategists, etc. You believe they will find ‘new jobs’ but we already have a global shortage of work and automation is going to exacerbate that in many sectors. Then you ignore the main point that there are millions of people who want advisors and analysts. Just because you don’t doesn’t mean nobody does. They exist because the demand exists from the clients.
Btw, how would you like it if somebody came to your place of work tomorrow and said you’re useless and we can replace you with a robotic automated system? Somebody who knew very little about the complexities of your profession? 
Supply. 
I’m sorry but all coins that stem from the genesis block are Bitcoins and not alt coins. That’s why “Satoshi” was against forking and also why experts on the outside are laughing.
The differences, block sizes and block times, of the new supply are not sufficient enough to make them different (in fact Satoshi proposed block size reductions and also moving the decimal around without forking). The fact that the new supplies need replay protection indicates they are not separate.
A good analogy would be the supply of gold. We say the original supply were 1 gram nuggets, then a new supply of 8 gram nuggets appeared, and then a new supply of 2 gram nuggets came along. They’re all gold despite weight difference. The overall supply has increased.
Another perfect analogy.
Imagine if there was £100 billion sterling in circulation. Then one day the Bank of England thinks that an extra £100 billion should be injected into the economy, but don’t want to hurt the value of pounds already in circulation. So the new notes are called Pounds Cash. Then two months later the bank decides to do the same again and this time they call the new supply Pounds 2X.
These are all pounds, serving the same function and originating from the same source. In the real world this would create hyper-inflation. In the world of Bitcoin the deflation keeps occuring because they create the illusion that these new supplies of Bitcoin are alt-coins and let speculators keep pushing the price of all of them upwards (even giving value to 2X that doesn’t exist yet).
The irony is that the figures who are creating the new supplies all claim their new coins are The True Bitcoin. So not alt-coins at all.
I shouldn’t need to be lectured to about the supply anyway. ;)

Would help not to spread false rumours. It makes this nascent sector look even more economically illiterate than it already appears to outsiders.
Bitcoin should be scarce if you want to it to be a commodity you can retire on. If a deflationary currency was owned widely it would encourage hoarding, reduce spending and destroy the retail sector that has very narrow profit margins, especially independent businesses who can’t scale. It would damage the lives of 2-3 billion people. Then who would be able to invest in Bitcoin at all?
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:47:35
It’s extremely dangerous and stupid for people to try to get free BTG. They should convert their Bitcoin to alts until the block height has passed.
The reason it’s stupid is because it will continue to encourage more Bitcoin forks and more free magic money. That is not what Bitcoin was created for. Every coin has to be backed by work. When you fork Bitcoin the new coins are clones that are not backed by work. Simply speaking, a contentious hard fork is pirate software that the pirate wants money for.
Then there is the danger. If you’re allowing Hong Kong based scams like this to thrive you are also funding the Triad who demand a percentage from every enterprise. They will use the money to enrich themselves, expand their base and we will see more counterfeiting, more human trafficking, more casino fronts and more dodgy exchanges to launder the shitcoins.
The result will be that the establishment will be proven correct that cryptocurrencies are a scam and they will ban all of it.

Censorship resistance is a feature of any blockchain whose records are immutable.
How is Bitcoin doing refunds, consumer protection, insurance, credit, cheap real time transactions, resolving legal disputes, easy auditing? It can’t do those and is far from achieving any of those objectives that are essential to businesses and customers.
Of course the biggest problem, aside from the huge amount of electricity Bitcoin uses, is that a currency that always appreciates will be spent less than a currency that loses value. It is hoarded as it gains value. That would really hurt the retail sector who run on very tight profit margins and employ the majority of people in the world.
Sorry, but Bitcoin can’t be used as mainstream currency and can’t compete with the established players in this field. Hal Finney was correct in saying it should be a commodity alongside gold and silver. Thus he said the name Bitgold was more appropriate.
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:00:19
Of course it does. There’s no need to shy away from it. “Satoshi” had a plan to offset it by having the mining eventually set up somewhere cold where it would be powered by geothermal and the excess heat would be reclaimed to warm homes.
But along came ASIC farms in China and ruined that plan. So now we struggle for a solution to this problem that grows exponentially.
One solution would be a cost effective powerful PCIE based ASIC card you could install in your home computer and you could offset the electricity use yourself at home. If many people did that then the hashing power would over time become more efficient and take control away from the inefficient farms.
To make that work you would have to find a way for home miners not to abuse the system. We saw people fill their homes with GPUs to mine Ethereum and it was impossible to offset that use.

Getting rid of the middle man sounds like a neat thing to do in the head but in reality it’s garbage. Which middle man are you talking about? If you’re taking about basic payments then the banks have been getting rid of employees and high street banks for years. If you’re talking about rest of the banking industry then you’re not dealing with reality properly because most of those jobs, millions of them, involve face to face meetings involving discussions and analysis.
But even regarding payments, Bitcoin has nothing on the horizon to address its very large power consumption and user friendly issues and other problems. These are fundamental. Apple Pay Cash will already make Bitcoin look redundant within a year when it comes to P2P. The base, ease of use and security is already installed. Facebook and PayPal began P2P payments last week. Samsung, Google, etc will follow within months.
Keep it as a commodity if you want to be taken seriously otherwise you just piss a lot of people off. When I mean a lot the number is extremely high compared to Bitcoin holders. The more you push this as a replacement for banks and money the more you make this look like a cult. You’re actually doing the opposite of what you intend and making it all look like a scam. Hence why so many people criticise it from the outside.
The biggest threat Bitcoin faces is endless forks. Essentially they increase the supply even when supporters claim they aren’t. It’s like I had a supply of 1 gram gold nuggets and then someone came along with 8 gram nuggets (Bcash) and another came along with 2 gram nuggets (2X). In the real world this would have reduced the value of all nuggets but in the unregulated wash traded and spoofed world of Bitcoin trading the prices don’t reflect reality. Is that sustainable?

It’s suitable as an asset like gold, as Hal Finney said, but you can spend it as a trade rather than a monetary purchase.
As a mainstream currency it would cripple the whole economy and be self-defeating. If a currency is always gaining strength and value, people will hoard it more than spend it. That wound hit the retail sector very hard where profit margins are very tight.
If you damage retail (which includes shops, restaurant, transport, hotels, tourism, etc) then the government will have no choice but to take action. Nobody wants that to happen.

It’s extremely dangerous and stupid for people to try to get free BTG. They should convert their Bitcoin to alts until the block height has passed.
The reason it’s stupid is because it will continue to encourage more Bitcoin forks and more free magic money. That is not what Bitcoin was created for. Every coin has to be backed by work. When you fork Bitcoin the new coins are clones that are not backed by work. Simply speaking, a contentious hard fork is pirate software that the pirate wants money for.
Then there is the danger. If you’re allowing Hong Kong based scams like this to thrive you are also funding the Triad who demand a percentage from every enterprise. They will use the money to enrich themselves, expand their base and we will see more counterfeiting, more human trafficking, more casino fronts and more dodgy exchanges to launder the shitcoins.
The result will be that the establishment will be proven correct that cryptocurrencies are a scam and they will ban all of it.

‘Why do you think this is the case?‘
Because a deflationary currency encourages hoarding and holding. The profit margins in retail are very very thin. It only takes 5% reduction in spending to completely collapse the retail sector. When that collapses a domino effect hits every sector.
The reason why currencies should have controlled inflation is to encourage spending and investments in stocks, properties and commodities (which would include crypto). A reduction in these investments is just as bad as a reduction in retail spending. 
The result, in that alternative universe of highly deflationary currency, would force government to intervene and bail out corporations and increase taxation. It’s 2007-2008 all over again but a lot worse.
That’s not a hypothetical scenario. The margins are really that tight. Economies are always balancing on a knife edge and it’s hard work.
But if we add an extra investment asset such as crypto then there is no harm, as long as it has evidence based growth and is not highly volatile.

If anyone could downsize banks and cut non-essential jobs banks would do it in a heartbeat. Retail banking has been downsizing for years and moving online. They will leave brick and mortar banking behind within a decade.

You will end up with morons with no education and no real world data giving economic and financial advice - like an Idiocracy.
Bitcoin is only doing transactions at the moment and the consumptions grows exponentially, unless the algorithm and the miners can become more efficient. Even worse, each fork creates more miners and obviously that means even greater energy use. All that just for payments if highly inefficient.

Obviously blockchains are taking off but online ledgers were inevitable. What can’t be sustainable though is a cryptocurrency that consumes a very large and exponentially growing amount of energy. Each fork is contributing to the problem even more. 
Why would we choose to maintain this when there are already other cryptocurrencies that utilise far less energy and much lower fees too?
Or do we protect Bitcoin as a revered cult because it serves the selfish narrow and temporary interests of people who hold it? If that’s the case it’s more akin to the Heaven’s Gate Cult than a truly evidence based financial system. It’s suicidal.

Closing banks? They have already closed many retail banks and moved services online. If banks could close branches and fire people they always do it very happily. 
But the majority of work the banking system does isn’t about payments from A to B. If you want to put millions of people out of work then it will impact every sector of the economy and you’ll end up with massive taxation, austerity and regulation.

It’s an important question. When forks create free magic money or when idiotic cryptos give out free tokens without PoW or PoS to back them, it increases the amount of coins in circulation which should cause inflation. But because of speculative pricing we aren’t seeing a realistic price reduction across the market.
That’s extemely bad. I cannot state this strongly enough. When you just go around creating free magic money not only is it an attractive incentive for organised crime but it has seriously damaging effects socially when all these free tokens are converted to cash. You end up taking cash away from those who worked for it and give it to people who didn’t work for it. That means more money will need to be printed by central banks, which is something nobody wants.
Logically that will not be tolerated by governments or financial sector.

There’s no solution on the horizon for the amount of energy Bitcoin uses per transaction (2000kWh). As it continues to scale and use more hashing power it consumes more energy. Every hard fork that results in a new coin also increases the demand for electricity. Most miners are not offsetting the energy use or using renewable energy.

Zimbabwe is a very bad example.
A proper central bank controls inflation by removing money from circulation.
There’s no such thing as unlimited supply BTW

You have to get rid of the blatant wash trading and spoofing on Bitfinex first.
Then eradicate the large amount of crime it has attracted.
Then pay capital gains taxes.
Then get Jihan to pay electricity instead of being subsidised.
Finally you can try to come to some kind of valuation based on social utility and lawful use.

They wouldn’t because Jeff is smart and worth more than BTC himself.
Overstock’s CEO only does it so he can hold more.
Microsoft has a couple of products you can pay with BTC but it’s a trial.

I’m 1000% sure. He was caught red handed in a sting operation hiring a hitman to kill a partner. 
Backpage.com also hosted a child abuse ring  who wanted to be paid in Bitcoin. They turned a blind eye to it for a long time until they were dragged in front of a grand jury.

Instead of increasing block size it would be preferable to stop spamming blocks and make the system more efficient first. Otherwise the bloat will only continue with 2/4/8/16MB blocks.

That’s a weak excuse. You are saying that it’s OK to give criminals more and better tools because they were already committing crime before.

It’s quite a challenge to build solar to that scale just for financial transactions when electrical demand is needed predominately for other things. 
The original plan was that when home mining was no longer possible, that mining farms could be established somewhere cold like Iceland where they have geothermal generation and the waste heat from mining could be fed to homes and offices. Some companies do that. But the majority is being mined in warm regions of China and Mongolia with subsidised dirty power from coal sources, while the poorest people in those regions are deprived of energy for cooking and light.

You will need to do a lot of reading up and navigating the wallet software and trade platforms. When you are comfortable that you know how it all works then decide.
Join Bittrex’s trading platform and download the Electrum wallet from bitcoin.org for a start. Look through everything there and then come back with any questions.

There are undercurrents you should be paying attention to. Sub-prime moved on to the automobile sector.

Everyone who held Bitcoin at this current block so they could claim free magic money - thank you for financing the Triad, encouraging more forkers to come along, making Jamie Dimon laugh, and kill Bitcoin off sooner than the banks expected.

If you do that are you going to offset the electricity and wasted heat?

Only as a digital commodity, and then only if scammers stop forking it.
You can’t get rid of its electrical consumption problem to make it a mainstream currency. We have one planet and it is peak stupidity to think we should use that much energy just for monetary exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:32:34
They can’t solve the power consumption per transaction problem, even with LN. Finney was correct to state that Bitcoin would be better off as a commodity because a widespread currency can’t utilise so much electricity without terrible consequences.
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:43:19
Go back to sleep. Deflationary currency as legal tender would cause such great economic damage that governments would have to implement super high taxation. It’s self defeating.
Think of it as commodities and securities only. Then you won’t piss off very smart people.

I don’t see how Monero enters this conversation. 
I don’t see a future for anonymity in the long term because it’s not humanity’s natural state and it was brought about because political ideologues, hardened criminals, corporate networks and government agencies fostered a climate of suspicion and subversion during the Cold War and the internet era so far.
Normally functioning law abiding people want to be open, joyful and share their experiences. This is the culture we should promote. Blockchain allows us to have a secure, transparent and accountable society.

There are charts that compare the amount of electricity Bitcoin, Ethereum and a Visa card use per transaction. 
Bitcoin is currently 2000 kWh,
Ethereum is 37 kWh,
Visa is 0.01 kWh
Even with LN Bitcoin won’t be able to make significant savings because as the global hash rate increases the electrical consumption rises exponentially. Vitalik has tweeted his support to do whatever it takes to reduce energy consumption and is embarrassed about the problem.
If Bitcoin ever gets banned it will be because of this more than anything else because energy security and climate impacts harm us even more than war and terrorism.

The report states how DLT can improve some businesses. It says nothing about cryptocurrencies.

Banks don’t just do payments.
Loans, mortgages, insurance, refunds, direct debits, credit, ratings, start up business advice, technical support, business development, market analysis, economic advice for politicians, market strategies for businesses, VC funding, IT infrastructure development for business and governments, stock market trading systems, valuations, hardware and software security, patent and trademark assistance and legal support, mergers and acquisitions, blockchain development ;) etc etc etc
Blockchain can’t and doesn’t need to replace all that. It should focus on specific use cases. In fact, when many new blockchain and ICO start ups begin their first phase they go to a bank for a loan.
As for mainstream use as payment service, blockchain addresses would have to be linked to identities also otherwise it’s not acceptable or user friendly for the mainstream.
Private keys would have to be generated with a biometric system.
But it may be too late. The biggest tech corporations are already releasing P2P payment systems via their established operating system and messaging platforms. P2P loan companies have been supported by banks for over 5 years. They’re doing that with lower fees and less electricity use than Bitcoin can do.
It’s best to think of Bitcoin as a commodity like gold if you want steady growth, but this whole issue of forks is a big problem.

Richie is always blunt and straight forward.
BTG is being traded on some exchanges purely on speculation. There are no coins, no wallets. Just fictional numbers being thrown around on a computer.  A black eye for the crypto world that will be difficult to heal.

Not accusing you but often when I have looked closely at these incidents I find they use infected web wallets and have downloaded pirate software which contain keyloggers.

NO. It’s not as profitable and it will encourage more people to try and fork.
