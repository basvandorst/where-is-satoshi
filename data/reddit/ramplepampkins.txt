mind giving any more details? haha. Android studio? How did you learn? How long did it take? any other projects? setbacks? What should i look out for?  If not that cool. I don't expect everyone to be a teacher haha. 
I have 1-2 years of java experience. however I've only ever made basic applications or complex console based applications. 
Nice app though. Very well put together and you can tell your experienced.

Mind sharing what you used to develop this with? I'm a developer in school looking to get into android dev.

If only I never wiped my drive 6 years ago with about 2 btc on it. It would be life changing money for me right now. haha. Granted I would only use some of it to get on my feet and the rest would be saved for the future!
Congrats on the 1btc. The bitcoin early adopters are some of the best people I know.

So you think the solution to high fees is to make the block size bigger?
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:22:47
No its satire making fun of people trying to get rich quick off of the bitcoin name. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:31:27
Serious question: Do you not think that bitcoin cash can destroy all crypto currency for our lifetime?
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:30:00
If you look into how both work you will see why. One of them is doing things that will not work in the future. The other is taking its time to make sure it will work in the future. One of them will work better now but will become beyond repair in the future due to current spur of the moment decisions to appear "better". This will destroy concurrency because people can't take the time to figure out what each one does and just assume that "bitcoin" crashed. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:08:22
Yea If I had lots of btc I would give so much away
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:43
but... that's not a tesla? Are you sure you used bitcoin????
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:25:43
I think everyone is missing the point. We have one chance to get this right. If we all support the wrong fork. (one that will not scale) then bitcoin will grow and then come to a crash and no one will trust it enough to get into another bitcoin fork. We have to choose the correct one.

May I ask any more detail son what kind of financial advisor you are? how many customers you have daily? weekly? etc etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:38:26
That's not actually true. People are upset because bitcoin.com and the guy behind it created this wallet that essentially creates a bitcoin cash wallet. If he had called it bitcoin cash wallet their would be zero issues. He is trying to scam people who want to get into bitcoin into getting into bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:41:55
Well unless the description of the app has changed this is what the app itself said it did. So maybe you need to do some fact checking. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:27:39
Newegg.com, Overstock.com, Steam all accept bitcoin. Larger companies have more to worries about so it will just talk longer for them to accept it. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:53:19
I'm convinced you are a troll now. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:18:40
Dude. maybe take a break from the internet for a while and get some fresh air. Do you know how silly you sound. Your "arguments" are easily picked apart. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:20:51
I don't think this has anything to do with bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:07:42


If people just "dont use bitcoin" then bitcoin has no value. you sound like a child who just got his first dollar bill from his parents and doesn't understand how much its actually worth.


No. This is actually your loss. That is assuming you have btc. This will cause btc to hold no value. currently btc is rising simple due to demand for the actual coins. the market cap is going up a LOT but the transactions are not. This means its not actually being used as a currency. So once adoption stops so does its value. This is unless crypto starts being used for as an actual alternative currency and not just an investment for techies and friends of techies. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:36:03
Not exactly the full story. bitcoin.com and the guy behind it market bitcoin cash as bitcoin to confuse new people getting into bitcoin. It's false advertisement and basically a scam so he can make money off of peoples confusion. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:46:40
This wont happen though unless we start buying things. I just bought a new graphics card on newegg and I think more people should do this. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:24:33
No not at all. The uses are growing every day. It's kind of like a catch 22 at this point. We need higher adoption but we can only get that if we have more uses for it. Newegg and Overstock are the 2 main retailers that I can think of off the top of my head. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:41:55
I agree.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:55:41
I agree. We need to start moving an a different direction. I see the future of bitcoin being the heavy lifter backend and then we have something for the front end every day transactions. The thing is this needs to happens sooner rather then latter if we want more adoption. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:16:40
The price of bitcoin is based on investors. Ask yourself what happens when everyone is invested? Bitcoin does not hold value due to what it can buy. It only holds value right now due to demand. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:17:13
No I just don't like repeating things to people who don't understand them the first time I say them. You are not looking at bitcoin as a long term currency. Bitcoin must go though several phases in order to survive. The phase we are in right now does not care if it is being used as actual currency or not. but when we enter the phases that DO care about being used as actual currency then bitcoin will die unless we start using it as actual currency. In order to do that more people need to adopt it. The guy who made bitcoin outlined this in his white papers even. I'm not sure why you insist on acting like an asshole. You must feel silly for how you are acting. I know I would. 
I love bitcoin. I do use it. It has value to me. but over time, this might change due to people not adopting it. You fail to realize that I'm talking about years and years into the future. You seem to be stuck on whats happening in the next few weeks or something.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:07:24
you get whatever the exchange rate was when you purchased it. I feel like your being paid to say this stuff lol. Noone is saying bitcoin is better in a 1 to 1 comparison as it stands right now. However we ARE saying that bitcoin WILL be better in a 1 to 1 comparison in a few years. Or rather it has the highest potential to be better. You can not argue with that. if bitcoin was what everyone used and it was 30 years from now it would be better when what we use now. 
To only think of the present is a silly mindset because you I'm sure that's now what you do with other aspects of your life. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:47:43
Yea fees and time to transfer is stupid right now. Everyone I try to get into btc gets turned away by this instantly. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:02:11
nupties sqeal about? If bitcoin stops being adopted then the demand goes down. It goes straight down to nothing. There is no market where people with bitcoin can live their lives without converting it to fiat. So the only thing giving bitcoin its price right now is the sheer concept that its rare. Let me put it this way. If noone wanted to offer you USD for you bitcoin how much would it be worth to YOU?
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:43:50
We are talking about the future though. the future of shipping is only getting faster. my examples of this is that the average time for things I buy is less then one day. obviously this is dependent on where you live. You don't need to be an asshole.
My point is that in the future unless bitcoin changes it will have a drastic effect on the time it takes for an item to get to your doorstep. This is a hurdle that could effect adoption. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:20:30
I would beg to differ. The way shipping is headed a lot of things take less then 24 hours to show up at my house now. Amazon would not be able to adopt bitcoin without dramatically effecting shipping times.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:43:08
To be honest anyone who heard me talk about bitcoin either asked me or started off the conversation making fun of me. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:38:42
What am I looking at here. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:49:27
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't this what Either was designed for?
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:00:29
I'm with you. I need this shit to go back down!
Then we hodl on for the ride!
@_date: 2019-05-15 04:35:22
You guys are naive if you think that dude doesn't have tens to hundreds of bitcoins already.
@_date: 2018-12-24 00:20:33
I have a hard time believing we would default to gold and silver rather then food and water. most of the US has no idea how much a gold bar is worth and switching cold turnkey to metals as currency wouldn't work. logistically it makes no sense at all. Ask everyone you know how many ounces of gold a loaf of bread would be worth to them. You will soon start to understand how screwed we are if the internet / electricity goes out. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 02:32:52
lmao. Their currency didn't rely on it. Their currency and norms also had decades to mature. Their society also moved at a snails pace compared to ours today.
We have an infrastructure that is responsible for keeping almost everyone alive. That infrastructure would cease to exist. You could not fix it in time. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:51:10
Of course CC companies are selling this data. That's a no brainier.
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:09:55
if internet and electricity are gone then I have some bad news for you.
