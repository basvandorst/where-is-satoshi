Curious as well.... I'm having difficulty understanding the warning

Hey, both parents didn't die from cancer.  My dad had the flu and I came back on day 4 with food and Sprite and found him cold hard dead in his chair blood coming from nose and mouth. Not everyone is a scammer. I have links to published obituaries and am willing to chat with anyone that's serious about contributing to my yearly project. I think you skipped that entire part. I'm trying to pay it forward on a day that haunts me every friggin day/night and saw an opportunity to make a larger impact than with the financially strained resources I have at the moment as compared to what I was able to put together last year. 
I'm sorry that you have such a poor outlook on humanity or others intentions.

I highly doubt that. I was just curious.

That's super kind of you to do that.
I'm new to Reddit, but I'm going to throw this out there - my mother died from metastatic cancer on Christmas of 2015 and my father unexpectedly this spring. Every year since my mother's passing I've gathered and wrapped socks, hats, gloves, backpacks, basic hygiene products, and if I can afford either food gift cards or at least a hot meal for as many houseless individuals as I can. This isn't some scam and I have photos and can send obituaries over. 
Last year I travelled to Denver and handed items out around 16th street and the camps on the outskirts of town. This year I'm not able to travel, so it'll be in downtown Madison and possibly Milwaukee Wisconsin (depending on how much I can gather.) 
I'd be happy to give personal contact info and keep in touch/share the story online. I was planning on creating a gofundme of sorts as my birthday is coming up and I'd rather people contribute to my "project" than anything.
I realize that people end up on the streets for a myriad of situations; some of which could be blamed on the decision making of said individual and some not. However, I think that regardless of how people have landed in their situation it's important for me to spread kindness and support versus drowning in my sorrows at a bar over what happened on that day in 2015. My mother was a nurse and only ever wanted to help others and I feel that this is something I can do when I couldn't do anything more to help her.

Do people project the value to increase from the publicity?
