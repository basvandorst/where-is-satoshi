Nope. 
A search for "Dorian" in just this subreddit shows 240 threads with thousands of comments.
The media might provide the articles, but you guys  (read: a vocal part of the bitcoin community) create the demand.

If only the comics were funny or original...
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:39:58
That's stupid on so many levels...

I would say that that is "the proper lesson" we can take out of all this:
Don't trust your big pile of money to anyone else but yourself. Keep it stored securely with a good backup strategy, and only transfer coins to a third party if you plan to use them there.

There is a huge difference in balancing stuff and keeping stuff in the exact same place. Quadcopters / Gimbals move a bit, the beer stays exactly where it is.

Oh god...

If it comes that way, it's still a major blow to the Bitcoin movement. If all BTC businesse have to move underground, it's never going to become the widely accepted alternative currency that we all hope for.
Yeah, great, you can feel like the elitist rebel still mining and trading, but the "product" will suffer. 
Better than accepting the "law" and moving into illegality would be actively challenging the whole regulation.
But yeah, you'd actually have to do something... other than just calling people sheeple from the comfort of your computer chair, and feel superior.

Holy Shit Bitcoin Community! If it weren't for your stupid satoshi hero-worship, this guy would have been left alone in the first place.
And now? Instead of just leaving him be, I see his name dragged through every forum every single fucking day!

How much would you be willing to pay for one?
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:18:36
Yeah, but knowing what lifeboatz wrote in his post, the movie is a bit less enjoyable...
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:44:27
Pfft. I "lost" about three quarters of a year worth of salary.
@_date: 2015-05-05 08:05:42
Same here. Can anyome explain?
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:34:05
more like ... double that and then some.

What a useless act.
Better option in my opinion: vote for a real human being, and educate her or him about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-17 11:38:04
Thanks, that sounds great! Will try.
@_date: 2016-10-17 11:37:49
How? The client already shows the "new" balance.
@_date: 2016-10-17 11:38:13
Thanks a lot!!
@_date: 2016-10-18 12:05:42
Hello, just some feedback: I have updated to the latest version and abandoned the transactions. Immediately my balance went up by 2 BTC, and I was able to re-send the bitcoins.
Thanks a lot!

If that's the case, I *made* about 30,000 bucks on my 500 Euro initial investment.
(at least it was 30k back in 2013)
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:26:10
Yeah thanks. Now we know...
@_date: 2016-05-31 12:49:57
You only "make" money if you sell your Bitcoins for more than you bought them. If you haven't sold (or bought something with your Bitcoins now worth more than before), you haven't gained or lost anything so far.
I guess that's what SplashArtist means.
