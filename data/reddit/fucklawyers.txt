Well then places should stop making exceptions! At least for VirWox, your first login fails and *then it asks for u/p and 2fa. Google asks one time per computer per default. Facebook hasn’t asked me since I set it up, but then again, I haven’t logged in anywhere since then. My bank asks once and then you’re golden for the next half hour or so of logins (u&amp;p only). If I logged into ANYWHERE that I have 2fa on, I wouldn’t be surprised unless I had just cleared my cache and cookies.

This right here is why cash is ubiquitous and still a thing. We had to invent negotiable instruments because there just wasn’t enough of it, but they’re far more complicated than cash. I think credit cards are arguably easier to *use* - i hand you a card, and a machine tells you yes or no, neither of us has to do any math. Not so simple past that though, with regulations, and the fact a bank *has* to be involved.
We all like to call it digital cash, but we’ve got a long way to go to get to the level of simplicity of real cash.

Lol, I manage 26 properties and you're a dolt. Landlords stomp on tenants.
@_date: 2016-06-04 06:26:24
**I** don't stomp on tenants. That's terrible business; it's very rare I have an empty unit because I'm more than willing to work something out with you (not on student rentals, fuck you pay me). 
But, when push comes to shove and A. you just couldn't pay the rent, or B. you trashed the place/pissed off your neighbors/brought the cops up in my jazz? Oh boy. I get to serve you by chucking the summons in the general direction of your door when every other plaintiff needs to pay for certified mail or a constable, and I get a court date within ten days (or three if you're on drugs). At court, I say hi to the secretaries as I drop off their coffees (I'm here at least twice a month because this little courthouse covers all of my properties), and we walk in, you at some point might get to say a few words, and I walk out with five judgments - one against your for being a dick and four other tenants that pulled that card this month.
At that point, either you pay me now for what you owed me *plus* court costs *plus* reasonable attorney's fees even though I didn't have an attorney *plus* interest from the day I told you you were late/a dickhead/a drug addict and get the fuck off my property, *or* ten days later men with guns toss you on your ass, and I store your property for thirty days after that.... only on day twenty, I can ask for a writ of execution and just sell your junk to pay me.
If that doesn't cover it, I have ten years to track you down, clean out your bone-dry bank account, have your personal property taken by force, and garnish your wages. And that's all by legal process, not because of our lease. But yeah, some shithead lazy fuck piece of shit better off dead in the ninth ring of hell landlords think tenants have power in this game, and somehow oppose tenant rights. *They* get asked to pay their lease in full before I give them their keys.

Indeed. You might be surprised at the stupid-crazy rewards that card companies will give to some customers. My father gets a free flight for every $20k or so through the card, so he just uses it as a charge card and uses it for everything, paying it at the end of the month. He pays no annual fee, no interest, and I'm sure the bank hates him for it. But they still keep sending offers!

Well, now you have to buy them. A few months back, some deputies held down a mentally retarded man, strip searched him, and forced him into the pink skivvies. He thought he was being molested, and now there's a big stink about it. Whatever, I make a habit of wearing pink to the jails to see clients, everyone thinks its a joke except for Sheriff Joe (he makes his deputies use pink handcuffs... think the prisoners care?).
And yes, it would be accurate to say I'm interested in defending human rights. It's why I became an attorney. I did supportive services at a section 8 complex before heading out west, and I'll probably be staying in the criminal defense world for quite a while. I quite enjoy its mix of subject areas, the only problem being some are in and out of my end of the system so quick I don't get to have much of an effect.

Ooh con law time! I'm nobody's lawyer!
So the US is divided up a bunch of different ways, one of those being the federal gov't and the state governments. Both get to make laws, but what if they don't agree somehow? Well, taxpayers pay some lawyers a shit ton of money, and ten years down the line, somebody gets rich!
The Constitution lays out what the feds can do, everything else not on the list belongs to something else. So, you play mental gymnastics with the rules and you end up with something like the situation with cars. The feds regulate safety and emissions standards ... but once the vehicle's sold, the states can either have it inspected yearly or just say fuckall. The state gets to register cars and license drivers. Hmm? 
Well, the constitution talks about interstate commerce, but it doesn't talk about roads really. So, as the car became popular, states beat the feds to the punch, and put licensing and road regulations in place. Since they are already doing it, it would be difficult for the feds to wrassle that control from them, no matter how they frame it. Similarly, the feds are in a better position and have a good peg to hang the interstate commerce power hat on when it comes to regulating the safety of vehicles sold nationwide.
Of course, that's a extreme oversimplification. There's many other federal powers and legal schemes involved. But it applies here - the internet's new. Traditionally, states regulate businesses like MTB's. The feds, for bitcoin anyway, are still not in the game. But what if tomorrow they said oh no, bitcoin's cool anyone can sell it? Well now we need to drag the lawyers out again and have a good ol' fashioned supreme court case! Nobody likes to let go of their power, and a power vacuum can be just as bad. Just look at pot legislation. 
Do YOU wanna open up a business that's legal when the feds might shitstomp it? Or worse - the feds come to shitstomp it and the state troopers come have a gunfight over it?
@_date: 2013-06-26 22:03:13
Well you're not completely wrong either, it's definitely different by state. And since compliance is so nebulous right now, I'd write my business plan to let me get the cheapest license possible but still be in compliance. At least then, you've got that fancy piece of paper on your side.

If you have an internet connection, face-to-face transactions are as simple as generating a QR code for a receipt address, printing it on a card next to your credit card terminal, telling your customer a total, and then waiting for the transaction to appear. You can decide whether or not to wait for confirmations.

@_date: 2013-12-18 16:00:19
Oh right, coffee hadn't been brewed yet, I was looking at it one sided. And I'm not accusing you of that! I'm just saying, if one plans it right, you can end up winning in the rewards. For example, I have a card that returns 1.5% as cash (that's over half the fee the merchant would charge the seller), and I get two miles for every dollar I spend during certain times. Since exchanges come and go - and the payment methods they take as well - every day, you will sometimes make out.
For example the last time I bought coins just to have some, I was using cash via ZipZap via BitInstant. The fees came out to around 4-5%, but that also meant I had to run around and carry a bunch of cash. Last time I used a card was via VirWoX, and you have to step through Linden Dollars to get to bitcoin, and I forget the fees. They were certainly higher than 4-5%, but I didn't have to drive anywhere, no risk on my end, I get miles and a small refund, and my credit improves. It might be more expensive in cold hard cash, but for some it can for *sure* have more value to use a card.
@_date: 2013-06-28 19:38:09
Because the funds required are ridiculous. I looked into it in my state, you can't even get a banking license without going in front of the board, and you'd damn well better be a financier trying to go do that. What I COULD do here is get a money exhanger's license and register with the feds as an MSB. the MSB registration is free, exhanger's license is $1500, you need a $25,000 surety bond, and unless you're an idiot and want to be a sole proprietor, something like $100 for the LLC/Corp application.
I'm gonna go grab myself a corp sometime soon, and see how much the bond costs. Are there ANY legal exchanges in the US?

Hey if ya know what you're doing, nobody's gonna stop ya. If you end up in court for reconstruction or interpretation of a contract and it's got bitcoin in it, nobody's gonna crap on your parade.

Remember when you got your first job? Fuck! Cashing that check was a pain in the butt. And then, if you put it in the bank, you couldn't get it out for a day or two, and even then you had to do it before 5PM or find an ATM that was free (or pay the fee). And then some places take cards, some take checks, some take cash, some take all three or only one or two. Some would take checks if you were over  and some would only take them if you had your driver's license with you. Some say Visa's OK but not Discover, some say PIN transactions only, others won't take debit cards. And on top of that, the only thing that was guaranteed was cold hard cash, anything else the bank could go "whoops!" and disappear the funds at a later date.
Well, you figured out that morass, right? Bitcoin'll be easy then!
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:46:52
In the US, it's almost always contrary to your merchant contract to charge more than you would for cash. I know that doesn't apply for buying coins, but in the right circumstances, it *might* be cheaper to use a card (especially if you bank fucks over bitcoin users).
What's the additional risk? I think it's *less* risky. If I buy coins with a CC and end up not getting my coins, it's a lot easier to dispute a card network charge than an ACH one.
@_date: 2013-06-28 19:47:03
If the money is in your wallet, it's gonna be very difficult to steal them anyway. I would think in ANY jurisdiction you would have the right to pursue the thief, certainly criminally. In the US, that would certainly be conversion, and the thief, even if found not guilty in a criminal court, could be held liable.
Now, if you're in an exchange, what you've said MAY be true BUT we've entered into a completely different domain. You have a business relationship with that company and in making that relationship, there were very likely terms and conditions. If you did not read them, sorry. But the exchange certainly can have you assume that risk as a condition of doing business with them. After all, you can assume the risk that a skydiving company will fail to put your parachute together, and even waive claims to their negligence, and that's your life on the line!
So, I'm not your lawyer, but be careful. You may be putting too much trust in your exchange.
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:18:22
Guy down the street sells bitcoins here! But that was part of my point - you gotta go down there, prove your ID, pay a fee, hope your check is under the limit and not on their "we don't cash these cuz they look funny" list, and THEN you have your cash. 
Checks were a kludge invented by British common law because they couldn't mint money fast enough, and that's exactly what they still are.

The reason I said it was my final for Contracts was a mock royalty negotiation. The confederate the professor used was her husband who does that shit all the time, and believe me, you're gonna miss something. 
Usually, I'll wax on about what might fly or what might not, but I refrain from saying anything other than "lawyer up" when it comes to bitcoin because right now, the stakes of fucking it up are *way* too high.
I'm of the mind that everyone entering the bitcoin economy should put a good amount of effort into minding their legal p's and q's. Only serves to make us look more legitimate.

Yeah. She actually wanted to hear my explanation. Unfortunately, it's kind of a turn off when you tell a *consumer* that yeah, once you've paid a merchant, it's irreversible. Acceptable for face-to-face transactions, unacceptable over the internet.
I do love the "You're nuts" look my friends give me. I've shown someone the exchange rate, had them say "Yeah, right" and then watched their jaws drop when I click a button and BitInstant drops a benjamin in my lap. I think a lot of people don't realize that there's no need for shadiness in using bitcoin, but it just doesn't seem correct to someone that I can transfer quite large amounts of money and convert them to cash without ever talking to a bank.

This guy nailed it.
During the Great Depression, banks fell like mayflies because when stocks tanked, everyone made a "run on the banks" and cashed out when the market crashed. I guess Wikipedia does a [decent job]( explaining it.
Exchanges already have this issue when they promise to process deposits and withdrawals 24/7/365. That's a LOT to promise in reality, when the back office has to dodge business and regulatory roadblocks often. If you make a cutoff every day and promise to process at least everything by the cutoff before you start again tomorrow, problems are much easier to solve. Bank holidays were built in as bigger gaps in transactions to solve problems.
So say *your* exchange has strict cutoffs; every transaction before 9PM is processed that night, everything after that counts towards the next day. Chase informs you of its ire and tells you they'll be closing your business accounts right quick. Bummer, eh?
Since you have a cutoff already in place, you can inform customers that well this sucks but starting with the next processing day, prepare to wait. There's no having to decide how many you think you can handle manually, customers have a set time limit to GTFO before they know they'll have to wait. You THEN have a bargaining chip to go to Chase with and say OK, let's just process these, and that will end our relationship, kthxbai. Better to have an organized game than a mess.
So you have a few days to cobble together a solution and at least get stuff moving, as there's always quick and dirty payment processors willing to make a buck. But, since your exchange *also* follows US banking holidays, you know up ahead you have a legit 3-day window to get a new permanent solution in place.
Of course, nobody says (yet) you have to follow any certain holidays. But OP's right - big processors will have their own cutoffs and holidays, even if they don't tell you that's what happens on the back end.

In the US, checks are still very much a thing. It's rather difficult for an American to transfer money to another individual without using a check or a pile of cash.
Personally, I like using Bitcoin where I can, because I like having the level of control I have above and beyond PayPal and a debit card. But without a good bank, Bitcoin can be a bit shady (meeting in a coffee shop to buy currency? what is this, north korea?)

I asked my mother, who's 55, about bitcoin. She doesn't have a cell phone (no service anyway. not even nextel.), her internet is still hard wired, hell the house still goes days without power because we're rural and she won't invest in a generator.
She had heard of it. She didn't understand the point, asking me why the hell she would use those when her Visa worked just fine. After I explained it to her, well, I'd say she would trust it, but just simply has no use for it.
For the average US consumer, I'd hazard a guess that most, even if they know about it, see no benefit in using bitcoin for purchases yet.
