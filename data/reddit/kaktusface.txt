The whole point of Bitcoin is to bypass the current financial system, including tax and accounting. It is like digital cash. Bitcoin gives you the privilege of not having to give a cut to the gov't or 3rd party. Just keep your BTC sales off the books.

Wanted to play poker online in highschool but none of the sites would let me because I was under 18. Couldn't lie either because you have to send in ID and other verification.
That's when I discovered anonymous bitcoin poker. I stopped playing pretty soon though because I became facsinated by BTC and did a few months of research on it and found the Bitcoin subreddits. Then I transitioned from poker/gambling to crypto trading.

That's a hidden bearish divergence...lol

What time frame RSI divergence are you talking about? I don't see any bullish divs anywhere

Yeah, Norway is seriously fucked up for the way they handled that...this dude killed 50+ people and he is probably living a higher standard of living than millions of poor people in America or Europe.

This is really awesome. The more bitcoin branches out to different goods/services the faster and wider the network effect will be.

I speak Hungarian and I never realized this...amazing.

You can call it whatever you want. Income, capital gains, whatever. Why should the government, who had absolutely nothing to do with the creation of that wealth or the facilitation of you investing in that asset, receive a portion of the profits?

Why should the government take a cut of your money from an investment that you made using income that was already taxed, investing in an anti-government, anti-censorship asset, and making money gains without help or interference from the government?

Yeah, it's pretty fucked up. People actually advocating for higher taxes just blows my mind.

True, thought he was talking about sending to a burner address.

Lost forever. Decreases total supply thus increasing value of the leftover coins which is why he said everyone benefits.

The shorts got liquidated *because* the price went up 10%, not the other way around. The reason price went up is because we had an important resistance level at 6800 which triggered stops and trigger buys when it broke, so we went up very suddenly.

Except the Bitpay card is in your name and every time you load it with BTC that counts as a sale of BTC for tax purposes. You can take the gamble that no one will notice or care if you are just doing it with small amounts, but it's risky.

Lmao I know...I'm just using it as an example to show that its different units inside of BTC like cents are units inside a dollar.
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:54:03
I agree with you completely with regard to taxes, I was just warning you that the Bitpay card leaves a paper trail with your name attached to it so it might not be the best method.

Yup. 1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis (think dollars and cents, it's like 100,000,000 cents in a dollar).
So you can buy a fraction of a Bitcoin and send that to your wallet. It will be expressed as a decimal, like 0.23635 BTC (aka 23,635,000 satoshis)

IRS does not care at all about source of funds. The exchange where you cash out might, if its a large amount, they might want proof of source of funds as part of KYC/AML. And then the bank where you deposit the money might want source of funds as their KYC. 
As long as you find an exchange which lets you sell to FIAT with and doesn't ask too many questions, you can then send that FIAT in smaller amounts to numerous different banks and financial institutions. Find ones that look at the source of the FIAT (the exchange) and don't go back two hops and ask about the bitcoin. 
Then, if you pay the correct tax you are good.

Depends on the printer. Some old ones dont have caches

Yup, agree 100% I have been using paper wallets as cold storage for years and never had problems because I've taken the proper care to 1) know what I was doing before I did it and 2) actually focusing and doing it the right way when I did it
I'd much rather have a paper wallet generated offline from open source HTML on a device never used for anything else and the keys saved on paper on a non-wireless printer immediately than a hardware wallet.
