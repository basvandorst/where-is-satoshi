how are altcoins and fiat that were not loaned out considered bfx assets?
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:27:53
if you manage to withdraw your funds intact and whole, be very grateful

Can you tell me how to verify my account as an american?
What documents would i need to scan and email?  Should i send in my bank account and routing numbers?

probably because there is a whole legal clusterfuck regarding liability between margin lending of fiat and bitcoin and who owe's who.
fiat margin lender lends out fiat to someone who buys btc, which then gets hacked.  technically the borrower still owes the lender fiat, but the bitcoins were not supposed to leave bfx.  who's liable to the margin lender for the fiat?  the borrower or bfx?
the best thing is for them to let the non affected account balances of alt coins and non loaned fiat withdraw.  
this is going to be a legal clusterfuck and im certain the $40mil worth of margin lenders will be hiring very powerful attorneys.  do not expect this to just magically start trading any time soon as in probably months.
if users are allowed to withdraw altcoins and non loaned fiat, take that as a gift of free money.  the alternative which is still highly possible is bankruptcy court and liquidation of all assets regardless of segregation of accounts.

where's their banking license?

Im sure the $40 mil worth fiat margin lenders and large institutions with fiat balances will be lawyering up as well to ensure they don't participate in socialization of losses.
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:44:44
when we're talking a $70mil loss, we can assume there will a lawsuit that will determine to what extent bitfinex has liability or no liability.

IANAL, zane says the bitcoins were "segregated".  
what if a court rules differently?  we don't even know which jurisdiction would rule over this issue.  bfx is registered in Hong Kong.  We also know that 2 months ago the CFTC an american regulatory agency fined bfx.  
this is probably the first time a major heist has happened exploiting a 2 of 3 multisig at a bitcoin exchange.

analogy: a thief breaks into a bank's vault and steals half of the jewelry contained in the safe deposit boxes.  the thief leaves the other half of the safe deposit boxes untouched.  the thief also leaves the cash in the bank untouched.
Should the bank now pool all the cash and remaining jewelry to liquidate and compensate all the users proportional to its USD value prior to the heist?  (assume FDIC insurance does not exist)
another analogy: i store some valuables inside a rental storage unit.  a thief breaks in at night and steals everything from half of the storage units.  
Should the property owner that runs a rental storage business be forced to liquidate all rental storage units including ones that were not burglarized to pay for the units that were?
I leave my wallet and phone in the gym locker while I am working out.  someone breaks into my locker along with several other lockers and steals my wallet and phone.  should the gym now take possession of the property inside the other lockers for liquidation to pay for my loss?

What about users that only have fiat ltc and etc. Will we incur losses?
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:38:23
why all assets?
the alt coins were not hacked
fiat was not removed
it is easily proven which altcoins and fiat that was not loaned out belong to specific user accounts.
how are the altcoins and fiat considered bitfinex's assets?

Is bitcoin considered money or property in this situation?
if it's considered property ie a car
a great example would be if you paid to park your car inside a parking garage among 100 other cars. a thief breaks in and drives off with half of the cars including yours.
you can sue the parking garage owner. how can you prevent the other owners of the cars that were not stolen from leaving with their own car? 
are the other cars that were not stolen supposed to be liquidated to pay for your loss?

aren't you guys filing for bankruptcy here?
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:17:01
which assets?  
bitcoin assets to be distributed amongst creditors or does that include altcoin assets and fiat assets to distributed as well
my guess is, if the losses are to be socialized, they will only redistribute from the remaining bitcoins not by liquidating the other altcoins and fiat.

@_date: 2016-08-04 12:46:17
they're filing bankruptcy; this is gox 2.0
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:54:46
the person who borrowed your funds owes you money not bfx
the person who lost those borrowed funds via buying btc which then got hacked has a claim that bfx owes them money via negligence or whatever.  
so the way i see it, the borrowers of margin longs and shorts  will be completely wiped out.
as a lender of fiat that was used to buy btc, i doubt you will be made whole but probably will get preferential share of assets over the borrower.

bitfinex is not a bank

Will this affect users who have Etc ltc and fiat in our accounts?  Will we have to suffer losses?
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:28:26
which assets should be liquidated to socialize those losses?
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:32:54
in your example, you own that 1 btc, if it was hacked, then you are owed by bfx 1 btc.
if the borrower's account was hacked.  you are still owed 1 btc by bfx.  (technically the borrower owes you 1 btc, maybe in that scenario the lender and the borrower of btc splits the losses?)
if both accounts are hacked, you are still owed 1 btc by bfx.
i still see it separate from another acount with bitcoins that was not loaned out and not hacked.
even more separate is accounts with only altcoins and fiat not loaned out.
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:48:34
there is a legal clusterfuck of liablity between margin lenders, margin borrowers and bitfinex regarding btc that was withdrawn from the hack.  until they sort that shit out, it is a legal land mine to restore trading.
let them separate what accounts and which assets are affected by the hack and what is not.
