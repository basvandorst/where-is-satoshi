Say what?
Where do you think seeds come from?

This seems like a paid propaganda piece from the banking system... 
It should just say 'We like bitcoin, but really we want something we can control'

All this "Leftist" talk really discredits what value there might have been in your critique of globalism. 
Socially liberal American values have actually played a role in enabling the neo-liberal agenda, but the economic policies that they have enabled have been created and orchestrated by the far right. Blaming "Leftists" isn't just missing half the picture, it's failing to understand the half the picture that  you're looking at.
I think it would be more accurate to say that America's left wing (as in the voters) have been unwittingly duped into supporting right wing economic policies of the global financial elite via their support for "moderate Republicans" like Reagan and Bush and "centrist Democrats" like Bill Clinton.
Is globalism and free trade good for us? Not when it's orchestrated by the banks. Would a borderless society allow for more instances of exploitive capitalism? I can't say I really have a clue...
[Here]( is a pretty interesting article that touches on the global economic issues that have brought us to this point.

Yep... Cuz most rich people are super productive and most poor people are just lazy. It has nothing to do with the distribution of wealth and capital.
I've actually never met a rich person who works as hard as rich people are suppose to work. I've met plenty of rich and poor alike who are productive and hard-working in their respective fields. Where I have seen a difference is that when a poor person is lazy, they generally have a pretty piss-poor life situation, but when a rich person is lazy, they have a safety net of family wealth to back them up, and their life ain't so shabby. Now think about what I just said in the context of something real (because we all know this 'lazy' talk is bullshit) like an illness or unexpected life event. 
Snobby assholes who think poor people are lazy have no concept of the safety net that they are inherently benefitting from... Nor do they have any concept of the meager safety net that they would gladly rip out of the hands of the people who need it most.

You're conjuring Boogeymen out of thin air and creating monstrous dictators out of random redditors who don't subscribe to the same religious devotion to your particular political philosophy.
Go away, hateful little troll.

What an idiotic blanket statement.

What a ridiculous exaggerated excuse to be an asshole.
Also, the phrase "by definition" does not pertain to logical fallacies by definition. Loving humans and life is defined by loving humans and life, not by what you despise, especially when what you despise is some twisted thing that you are literally projecting onto others.

I guess you don't understand the logical fallacy thing. You made 3 statements. All 3 are different examples of logical fallacies. 
Good luck being you.

I don't believe other humans are 'subhuman'. What a despicable attitude to take based on a political philosophy.


Yea. I'm sure that will happen and I'm sure that's what he meant. /s

U thought openbazaar was like decentralized eBay. Is this the same thing or just the same name?
