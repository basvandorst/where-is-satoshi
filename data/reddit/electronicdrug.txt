Not sure what the fuck he's on about but some states have ruled you can charge the fee to the customer 
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:21:19
Yeah. Like I said idk wtf he's talking about 
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:47:31
That's fine, but it doesn't make it more appealing to use today. 
Don't get me wrong, I still use it regularly.

Not a good argument when the bitcoin value fluctuates so much lol

I never mentioned the international aspect or considered it in my first comment. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:20:03
That seems to coincide with what I was told. There wasn't a ton of assembly going on. 3-4 guys working on one unit at a single workbench.
Dave did mention they were sending to the software developers first, and wouldn't say when any were being shipped to customers.
@_date: 2017-06-11 02:19:44
Yeah I admit I don't know much about that aspect. All of the international travel I've done I've had no problem just using my US bank card. (Canada, Caribbean)

In response to him saying I can't count, let me clarify what I meant was there were 3 benches, but each had 2 sides, totaling 6. I suppose you could put 2 men on each one of those, but that's not what I meant.

Right at 435 and Roe

I don't pay any fees to my bank mate
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:16:47
I did not, I was touring right around the time it was crashing (and I didn't know it was crashing at the time) but it looked like it was all normal days work.
Although Dave did seem a tiny bit annoyed I just showed up rather than making an appointment.

I live in KC, and went there earlier today. Small place, definitely not a bunch of rigs mining, I went in every room.
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:56:22
I just said I don't know much about that aspect? lol
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:15:21
Yeah my friend and I were confused as well. It looked like the 3-4 guys at assembly weren't doing much at all, they were all at one workbench working on one unit.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:14:05
There was quite a few boxes on pallets in the back storage room. I didn't see a large number of assembled units out anywhere at all.
Apparently the boards are made in Chicago and assembled here in KC.

Depends on cup size.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:18:21
Dave said they were assembling the ASICs, and I did see one jalapeno hooked up to a laptop, possibly mining.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:31:20
I'm inclined to agree with you. I definitely didn't get any vibes that they were a scam. They weren't trying to hide anything at all.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:20:03
I think I annoyed him a little showing up unannounced, so I probably won't be going back. However, it looks like a few other redditors are in the area and may be willing to take pictures.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:12:57
They appeared to be, but I didn't see a whole lot of assembled units anywhere. Dave said the hold up at the moment was software, and the current units were being sent to the software developers.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:03:07
Thanks again for just showing us around when we barged in. We just happened to be in the area and figured we'd pop in and at the very least get a look from the front desk.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:28:01
Haha, sorry but I didn't take any pictures. The tour was pretty quick.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:53:45
Just one, but he threw glitter at me and disappeared.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:25:02
They did take the time to give me a tour when I just walked in unannounced, so they're nice enough.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:16:21
The assembly area looked like it was about 30-40'x15', with shelves lining two of the walls with a lot of empty cases. The workbenches were about 4'x2'.
I have no real knowledge of production or manufacturing, so I can't say for sure, but imo 400 seems like a lot for what they had going on. I think closer to 100 seems reasonable, but I don't know.
EDIT: Changed measurements to something more accurate (I think)
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:17:37
I don't know for sure I guess. I just know that I saw inside every room there and saw no completed units except one being used. But I guess I didn't see very many completed units at all really.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:12:10
It's in Leawood, KS. You can get the exact address by looking it up on google maps.

I'm not sure what a wafer is, but they didn't seem to be too concerned with security other than your normal commercial security system.
