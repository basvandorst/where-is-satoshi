Yeah, I know a ton of people who are a bit too scared to sort of wade into other exchange services like binance or GDAX, so hopefully an add to coinbase would open it up to a new market. I wouldn’t be surprised since it has like the 3rd largest market cap or something like that

I’ve heard rumors that XRP might get put on coinbase sometime in 2018. If that’s true I would expect to see a reasonably large bump in price honestly

I just bought in for the first time at 200. From what I can tell from research, recent trading in CB has caused a massive drop, so hopefully buying now while coin is cheap relative to recent pricing will yield some sort of higher return in the coming months. It probably isn’t too great for people who were already holding, but this seems like a good time for beginners like myself to break into the market and sort of test the waters. Please somebody call me out of this was a mistake though, this is all semi-new to me

When I went to bed last night Coinbase was telling me it was at 16,000 or so, and looking at charts for the past day shows a high of around 16,400

Yeah, I had an alert set to notify me if it dips beyond my original buy in price and it didn’t tell me shit

Eh, I would have said the same yesterday, but then it surged to almost double its value, so XRPs been nothing if not unpredictable
