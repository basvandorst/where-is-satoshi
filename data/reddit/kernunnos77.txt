Hey - I wanted to let you know that I haven't forgotten.  I got side-tracked today with ~~piracy~~ free-market digital entertainment procurement and dispersal, and wrote a 1000-word essay about myself for another bitcoiner.
It's 8pm here, and I'm about to go to tent after a movie with my lady, but I give you my solemn word that I WILL post a Youtube video of me playing guitar.
Haven't decided what song to do, but I've got Jethro Tull stuck in my head so I'm gonna see how Up to Me sounds on the 12-string.
I should be able to record via webcam while I'm looking at the chords / lyrics.  I can do better versions of my originals if you'd prefer, and maybe a cool Bowie song.
Heck, I'll just record me practicing whole songs and try not to screw up enough to restart the recording every couple minutes.
@_date: 2015-06-03 14:04:35
I definitely will.  In all, I was pretty disappointed in my webcam / built-in mic quality.  I had to have an unshaded lamp next to my head in order for the cam to see me at all.
Thanks for the tip, man!
Maybe someday I'll convince the gf to get out of the house with me for open mic night and she can record me there.

I'm truly sorry that that's the only thing you took away from my post.
I just mean it sounds kinda funny, not that I deride people for their optimism.  I hope it jumps to $10,000 too, but I think it's more likely to be a slow climb with plenty of little peaks and valleys along the way, instead of a parabolic curve.

Now THAT's a handy tip.
I've been going to Coinbase to check, which is dumb bc I have 2fa going and the phone involved isn't mine.
Come to think of it - I should move my bits out of Coinbase before they go all MtGox on us.
Checked - yep it works.  357.99 USD per time of posting
Edit:  361.97  It'll be $10,000 each ANNNNNY minute now.

Thanks, man!  I was worried that it kinda just stopped half-way through, but I'd already cut a couple paragraphs and cleaned up some verbiage.
The second half is much more concise:  "He joined the real world, promptly went insane, and lived happily ever after!"
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:40:08
I miss my Vaio (screen is dead / doesn't auto-connect to external monitor, even with the F-something hotkey).  The mic on it was great (good enough) and it was what I used on the reverbnation stuff, with Audacity as my software.
Had I studied / played around with Audacity more, I could've cleaned it up or added effects, but I left it raw for posterity's sake.
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:23:02
Actually I own quite a few bits now, thanks to the kindness of many bitcoiners.  A couple have even encouraged me to start writing and playing guitar again!
I need to follow my own advice, though, and move my bits from coinbase and changetip to an offline wallet.  I set one up on blockchain, but I still feel like I need to look around at the different types and learn more about security before I choose one to use permanently.

Absolutely!  Glad you liked it.  It's 9am here, and I just got indoors (I use neighbors wifi at gf's apt) so I'm gonna eat a bit of breakfast before I start drinking and writing.
Turns out drinking is an integral part of writing, but writers have known that since Hemmingway, at least.  Eh, probably closer to the Sumerians, or whoever wrote The Epic of Gilgamesh.  That guy must've been loaded to the gills.
@_date: 2015-06-02 01:34:49
Took me a while, but I did it.  I apologize for the potato camera / sound, but oddly enough, I kinda like the unintentional phasing / reverb weirdness.  That may have been from me leaning back and forth while playing.
@_date: 2014-12-25 16:12:49
As an investment, he's probably right.  It's no more guaranteed to increase in value than anything else.
From what I understand, Bitcoin is better used as an *alternative* to fiat, not as a way to multiply it over time.
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:19:57
I gathered that.  Is there a way to associate the same wallet with a different email address, or should I just treat them both as compromised?
It doesn't really make much difference with a balance of 0, but it would be cool to know in the future, just in case gmail or yahoo prove to not be paragons of internet security.
@_date: 2014-07-10 02:18:33
Are people just making random stuff up for the tip bot?  I always see people tipping the weirdest stuff, like moon suits or fist bumps or something, and I laugh...
Then I see it confirmed, and I'm all... lolwut.

Make an exception that ALLOWS certain behavior / access.
For example:  Whitelisting Reddit in Adblock allows you to see ads on Reddit, which is nice because it gives Reddit more ad revenue and their ads aren't annoying or malware-ridden.

Are all the btc owners rich?  Because I'm neither but aspire to be both someday.
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:13:58
Oh good lord, man.  I'm entirely too broke to actually buy them.  I was looking into btc more as a means to earn money (even tiny amounts) over time, and then saving until I have a whole one or two.  (Then I'll spend some, but not all.)
My laptop isn't good enough for mining, so I'll probably end up doing surveys and ad-watching in my free time.
I've been interested in Btc for a while (long time lurker), but I always looked at is as one of those investment things where people who join early get the biggest returns.  Now I see it as just another form of currency, but not taken everywhere yet (good for savings vs impulse buying), and unable to be counterfeited / over-printed.
The offer of .1 - .15 btc was too much of a head-start for me to pass up, especially considering the risk was only ~20 minutes of my time and a really, really cool email name that I didn't expect to get.  I probably have to burn both the email AND the wallet, but that's okay.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained, I guess.
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:33:28
Well, crap.  I just fell for it.
I didn't have a wallet and a free ~$60 was too good to pass up.
On the bright side, now I know how easy it is to set up a wallet and two-factor authentication.  I guess I can quit playing on bitvisitor and trying to get coinworker to reload, since my wallet is compromised before I got my 1st satoshi.
@_date: 2014-04-30 21:48:53
I thought it was funny, then I read the comments about it being that high in 2 years...
Did this place turn into the of alternative currency?  I seriously can't tell who's bullshitting from who's wishing anymore.

Look, I totally get that violence is advocated in the Koran.  Same goes for the Bible.  I won't try to say that the entire religion is rooted in peace, because that's just BS.
What I'm saying is that not all the PEOPLE who follow Islam go by those parts.  They're not all bloodthirsty savages running around plotting to kill infidels - that's just a fringe group that makes the news every day.  Like any religion, the majority of its followers just follow because their family has always followed it.  They do it for a sense of community, or because it brings them peace.
The Bible advocates stoning people for a MULTITUDE of reasons, but having been in churches throughout my childhood and a bit into adulthood, I have yet to see a single stoning.
Just because something is in a holy book, doesn't mean that all the followers are going to do it.

It was a blockchain wallet.
I'll have to do a bit more studying and make a proper wallet, then.  I just Googled "how to create a bitcoin wallet" and followed the steps on the first legit-looking link, which was blockchain.
Oh well, nothing lost and I learned something before I have anything to lose, so I'll count it as a win.
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:47:22
Sure.  Let me just go create another email address and btc wallet.  If nothing else, I'll make it LOOK like there's more interest in Bitcoin by generating unused, empty wallets.
I'll be like those lvl1 characters in every MMORPG, except for the part where I'm not a bot.
@_date: 2014-11-15 14:55:37
Well that isn't right at all, unless you only count the loud minority for both groups.  Like ANY group of people, there are good and bad examples of devotees.
Some Muslims are terrorists, some feminists are insufferable man-haters.  That isn't the purpose of either group, as a whole - just assholes among their members.

Oh man, I hope you didn't turn off notifications for replies to your comments, because this seems the best place to put my story.  I'll send a PM pointing here, just in case.
**About Me:**
It’s odd.  People talk about themselves all the time, and I am no different, but when asked to write a bit about myself, I have no idea what to say.  I’ll try to be as concise as possible, and I don’t know where to begin, but a tiny red king once said, “Begin at the beginning, and go on till you come to the end; then stop.”
My father was 47 years old when I was born, and my mother was 24.  My paternal grandparents were born in 1903 and 1907, respectively, and lived well into their 90s.  I know, this is my story, not theirs, but they were probably the biggest influence on my moral compass simply because they didn’t try to be.  They were just good, without motive, and that is what I strive to be.
My childhood was fairly typical – got into trouble for fighting and playing in mud puddles a lot when I was in grade school, got picked on a lot in middle school for being different (not sure how they knew), and felt like a complete outcast in high school.  Mom and Dad split when I was pre-Kindergarten, but were geographically close so I saw him and my grandparents on weekends and for a few weeks each summer.  I lived for those weeks of summer, when I had free reign to do kid stuff (so long as I stayed out of Meemaw’s flowers).  I wasn’t allowed to go wandering the hills and woods alone until I was old enough to carry a rifle with me (~11 years old in TN – gun safety was taught me from my first bb gun at age 7), but I could build bike ramps and ride a go-kart and skip rocks (so long as Peepaw wasn’t fishing nearby).
Home life was a drag.  Mom and step-dad were strict on discipline and shy on praise unless it ended in “but” or “if”.  The most common phrases were, “Your teachers all say you’re SO smart but you need to apply yourself,” and, “You might be alright if you’d just straighten up and fly right.”  Can’t say I was beaten, but I got a lot of whoopin’s with belts and paddles, got smacked upside the head a few times, and I seem to remember my stepdad kicking my ass (literally, his foot to my ass several times) one day when I smarted off and Mom wasn’t around.  He never touched her or my sister, so I made it my goal to piss him off as much as possible.  In my teen years, I realized he had high blood pressure so I actively tried to kill him by pissing him off.  It didn’t work, but he did have a quintuple bypass at the age of 38 which coincided with me graduating bootcamp.  No one came to see me, and I was more proud of that than my high school graduation.  Everyone’s SUPPOSED to graduate high school, but the Army is strictly voluntary – people try and don’t make it all the time.  Also, school was easy.  Hell, bootcamp wasn’t THAT hard – I’d been yelled at and ordered to do stuff that didn’t make sense for years.
Anyway, I had good grades on tests and quizzes, and did barely enough homework to make sure I knew the subject so I could ace the tests.  I read a lot and played a lot of video games.  At age 16 I started working full time at Wendy’s, and I swear to gods I’d never seen my mother so proud of any of my accomplishments.
Never got laid in high school, didn’t have any girlfriends that lasted more than a couple weeks (kinda par for the course, looking back), and somehow STILL didn’t start smoking the reefer until halfway through my senior year.  Heh, that’s an interesting story in itself:  I’d been offered pot before (since 9th grade, from peers I’d known since 2nd) but never had any interest in mood-altering stuff until we covered the effects of each drug in Health &amp; Wellness class (replaced gym) in grade 10 or 11.  I immediately fell in love with LSD.  Euphoria, happiness, feelings of being god-like?  Sign me up.
None of my friends would hook me up until I at least tried pot first, though, to make sure I didn’t flip out or anything.  I hung out with those friends a lot (they all liked the same hippy music I’d been listening to on my mom’s albums since forever, and everybody else liked pop), and I had a vehicle, so I was the ride home from work.  Everyone was cool with the idea that I didn’t smoke, and eventually stopped asking altogether.  One night after a particularly shitty fast-food shift, another friend (who’d never asked before) saw me just chilling on their couch while they were loading the bongs and simply asked, “Hey man, you smoking with us tonight?”
“Sure, why not?”  I didn’t get high the first time, but I felt different, like I’d done something that could never be undone (not negative, though).  We all played guitar and were into sword-fighting and Nerf wars, so I became a frequent smoker almost overnight.  I eventually got my acid, and it was everything I’d dreamed of.  I could actually function socially, I was everybody’s friend, and all badness in the world just disappeared for a while.  I kept count in those days, and I had taken 96 and a third hits of acid within my first 6 months.  Mostly 3-5 hits at a time bc blotter was weak in the ‘90s and I’d done my research comparing dosage strengths between the ‘60s and ‘90s.
There were side-effects.  No, I didn’t twitch or turn into a glass of orange juice – it was worse:  I realized that everything I’d ever been told was bullshit.  Not just concerning drugs, but everything – work, college, legal / illegal activity, church (holy shit I skipped that part – short version is Mom went religiously insane and convinced me to emulate her beliefs briefly in my teens.  I actually thought there was something wrong with my soul because I couldn’t speak in tongues like everyone else at the church, and I didn’t fall over when the preacher put his hand to my forehead like on TV).  I digress.  Everything was a sham and I KNEW it for the first time ever.  I’d been doing whatever I was told / shown because I believed it to be the way things are supposed to be done, and suddenly I found out that there was an entire WORLD out there, chugging along like a locomotive, without following the rules of my mother or her stupid book (sorry, religious people – I’m writing in the tone of an 18 year old.  I now think your books are beautiful and I’m glad to have read them).  And the world was doing JUST FINE.
The summer after senior-year’s summer, I was given this ultimatum (by step-dad):  “Go to college, join the Army, or go to jail.”  I’d already been to jail (and received awesome scars on my back bc someone decided that “assault with a deadly weapon might get me sent to the pen’") so I picked up the course-books for my hometown college - TTU, which is (was?) a pretty decent engineering school – and started poring through them, planning for the coming Fall semester.  I was working at Hardee’s then, bc they offered me 50 more cents per hour and now that I was 18 I didn’t have to work off-the-clock after midnight)
That wasn’t fast enough for his taste, so I chose the Army and left town “on the first train smoking.’”
I became a scout for the Army.  Never saw combat, but I got to see the inside of many bars in Friedberg (that’s where Elvis went), Germany.  I spent more time with locals than with other Joes.  I’m still a scout in some ways, I guess.
* Sorry, man.  I’m not good at concise, but that’s roughly the first half my life (missing some details) in [hopefuly] not-too-many words.
Edit:  removed / closed open quotations and parentheses, changed a word here and there for clarity

Thanks a million for this FAQ.  This is my first day as a participant in Bitcoin, but I've been a lurker and fan for quite a while.
I'm digging it.  Everyone is super helpful and friendly, and I've learned a ton in just my first few hours of exchanging comments on another thread.

I don't have an associated account with the prepaid card - it's the one my funds are put on from the plasma center.
The checking account w/o credit check sounds superb, and all for both of us gaining from it (also, it will complete my coinbase thing so that it doesn't feel / look unfinished).
Shoot yeah, send me the referral, and thanks again, man.

Lol, that's like going to and asking if anyone thinks religions are silly.
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:31:33
Thanks for that.  I was just wondering whether coinbase was like an exchange.  I still have some FAQ and sidebar reading to do, but I'll definitely set up a wallet that isn't like an exchange.
@_date: 2015-05-31 02:04:11
I'm just glad to be in at all.  The price was high when I started lurking and reading [mostly just] headlines, but the mood seemed to be, "worth a thousand today, surely worth two thousand by the end of the week."
It was crazy, and I was skeptical.  I'm still curious as to how often prices (in bitcoin) change at places where you can pay in bitcoin.  Like, will I ever be able to think "this costs x bitcoins" instead of "this costs y dollars which is x bitcoins here?"
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:59:14
No hurries.  I don't give plasma again until Tuesday, anyway.
I was about to buy a dollar's worth from changetip until I noticed the bank fee of $1.05.  It's better to wait until I can get at lest 5-10 at a time, but at least now I know how easy it is.
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:05:31
Yeah I caught myself about to buy $1 worth of bitcoin from changetip with a $1.05 bank fee.  The card is prepaid and unable to go into debt, but I have $2.93 left on it - that's a beer and a country ham biscuit, easily.  87 cents won't buy either.
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:35:51
Not gonna lie - My biggest excitement so far is seeing a 5-digit number (bits) before my brain tries to process the exchange rate.
I may only have 2 dollars, but that's an absolute TON of satoshis.

I don't have any videos, but I'll post my reverbnation.  It's all audio, recorded in a van on my laptop about 5-6 years ago.  I'm singing and playing 12-string guitar, *and* I wrote all the songs, except for the chorus (and the chorus's chords) to Angel's Cry.
A friend borrowed my chord-structure for the rest of that song, put her words to it, and added the chorus (and its chords).  I wrote the verses on my version.
Warning:  Most of these songs are sad, remorseful, pining for lost love stuff.  Hard Kid Blues and Knight in Shining Armor are more upbeat.  Crossroads is the prettiest guitar-part I've ever written.  I like it better without the words most times.
The pic was taken 10 years ago.  I still have awesome (better than then) hair, but now I have a goatee where my lack-of-chin used to be.
*I accidentally a word
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:56:52
Oh good lord I could never afford a whole one.
Honestly, I'm thinking of using bitcoin as a savings account that I can't just spend all willy-nilly.  Likely, the only in-person places I could spend btc in this town are upscale places that I couldn't afford anyway.  
I can spend $3 on sandwich and a beer just 2 blocks from here at the T-Mart.  If I were to spend bitcoin on (admittedly, much better) sandwich and beer, it would be at a place that charges $10 for the two.  (Which is not an unreasonable price, just beyond my current means / taste)
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:12:06
Holy shitballs, Batman!  I now officially have more bitcoin than fiat.
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:18:12

Rhetorical.  I know there are an absurd amount of variables.
@_date: 2015-05-30 17:43:32
I don't know much about bitcoin, and am unlikely to ever own one (I like the idea, but don't have extra money to invest / convert-then-spend-anyway), but even I know:
DO NOT STORE YOUR BTC IN EXCHANGES LIKE IT'S A BANK.  There's a reason for using exchanges, and I don't know exactly what it is, but they are NOT for long-term storage.
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:26:16
I'm set up on Coinbase now I think, or almost there.  2-factor authentication on the phone, verified thru email.
It won't let me link to my prepaid citibank visa, and when I "Skip, I'll do this later" it takes me to the Unlock Buy / Sell page, with a Complete Now button that sends me back to the Add Bank page.
It asks me to log into my citibank account, then tells me wrong name / password.  I know the name / password are correct bc I used them just now to check my  balance.  Maybe it's an issue with prepaid cards?  I don't know have my routing &amp; acct numbers or I'd try the Other Banks link.
Anyone know if prepaid cards work on coinbase?  Or do I need to just call the # on the back of the card?
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:08:45
Don't downvote the man, he asked an honest question and paid me a compliment in the process.
I give plasma, not blood.  ~$50 per week.  ~~Not sure if illegal activity is vilified here, but I sell movies, cds, etc, too.~~  I do physical labor for cash, mostly easy home maintenance that ppl don't feel like doing or don't realize its simplicity, and sometimes I get to do something cool and technical like re-installing windows / updates / drivers /etc., removing malware and toolbars, or even rewiring / repairing small electronics.  I can fine-tune the bridge, tremolo, and neck on an electrical guitar, as well as replacing all its innards, but that doesn't come up very often.
I have foodstamps, and I have a felony conviction (8 years ago, no further arrests other than a single drunk-in-public).  No disability, but I'm likely insane to some degree.  I don't talk to doctors about anxiety for the same reason I wouldn't walk to the hospital to get an x-ray for a broken leg.
In short, I'm probably poor because I've never really sought to have *more* than enough.  I cook and eat well, I have good friends, and I sleep comfortably whether indoors or out.  For myself, that is enough.
Thank you for saying that I speak well, and I am not embarassed by your question at all.  It *is* a point of oddity.
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:51:18
Aw thanks man.
And yeah, the fact that my original comment was "don't use online storage" coupled with "hey, these are so easy to set up!" has not gone unnoticed.
On the bright side, I'll get some practice moving bits around among changetip, coinbase, and my eventual offline wallet once I check out the wallet wiki.
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:23:33
I've seen a lot of different schools of thought while lurking.  
* There are your heavy investors, who just want the price to rise a lot, then sell em for a nice profit.
* There are business owners who want to accept bitcoin as payment in order to reach out to a new demographic / diversify their income.
* There are people who advocate a complete switch from fiat to bitcoin, mostly for political / economic reasons.
* Many people say that just being active with bitcoin, buying / selling / using small amounts frequently, is the driving force behind its growth.
* A few people bought when it was high, and were REALLY hoping it would double / triple in price again shortly thereafter.  Some are pretty jaded about it; others are in for the long haul regardless of the price.
Haven't seen a lot of people advocating bitcoin for the poor, but I think there was one guy who backpacked across the country using nothing but bitcoin for his purchases.  I plan on using it to save up for something cool, like a good home-built pc, or false teeth for my girlfriend.
It'll be easier for me to save than cash, because I can't just go out and grab little stuff I don't need.  Those $2-$3 purchases add up and wreak havoc on any attempts to save.
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:48:19
Thanks, man.  I feel like I've been given an absurd amount of tips (totally not complaining) considering that all I did was tell people not to use exchanges for long term storage.  I learned that from the *headlines* here.
Before today I kinda thought a paper wallet was just writing down that long string of numbers (and another, private string of numbers) on a piece of paper.  I'm learning as I go, and everyone is helping me a LOT- not just the donations, but with tons of good info, too.
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:25:12

Poverty, mostly.
It looks really easy to get into - I had a wallet once bc I almost fell for that "giving away $60 of btc, just send *me your email and public wallet address."  It was fake, but I didn't lose anything bc I smelled a rat and made a new email acct.
I'm subbed here because I like to keep up with what's going on, though.  I believe in bitcoin and it seems to be a groovy way of doing business.  
I still laugh at the "Gonna be worth $10,000 each by the end of the year, Jerry; just you wait and see!" crowd, but I'd be hoping the same thing.

Glad I could help!  Today is the first day I've been a participant instead of just a lurker and I couldn't be happier.
Funny enough, I didn't have a wallet or any bits to put in one before today, so I set up at coinbase when someone gave me my first bits.  Now I have to set up a paper wallet or risk becoming a hypocrite.
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:23:44
You rock, man.  That's exactly what I was looking for, and you even included the OS for the ones I've heard recommended today.
And a groovy link.
1000 bits
This is my first time trying to give, so lemme know if it doesn't go through

I'm implying neither, simply stating that banks are currently more secure than BTC exchanges.  Do you disagree?
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:15:49
This is why the average \^ ^American consumer does not want Bitcoin to replace fiat.
Bank gets robbed?  Your savings are insured up to $200,000.  Bitcoin wallet or exchange gets hacked?  Better hope it was that one guy who takes all the unsecured Bitcoins then gives them back when people identify themselves with proof.

Thanks, man!  Damn you guys are encouraging.
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:45:41
Thanks a ton, man!  I'm working on setting up coinbase and figuring out if I can connect it to my prepaid card.
While at the coinbase site, I saw the price go up 15 cents already and got excited.  I've got the fever already.
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:31:56
Thanks a ton, man!
I collected it the changetip site, but now what?  Do I create a wallet and move my btc there, or is it stored by changetip?
Sorry, I'm still pretty new at everything.  I'm checking out the links from the bot right now, so forgive me if what I just asked is answered therein.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:31:28
You're absolutely correct.

No problemo!  I'll try to cover the longest amount of time (number of events) in the fewest words.  I'll try to gloss over the boring bits like childhood and the brief period I attempted to live the status quo.
The hardest part will be mentioning the worse parts without seeming like I'm complaining, or talking about cool stuff I've learned without seeming like I'm bragging.
Thanks for the gold, too!
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:26:24
Thank you so much.  If people keep tipping me, I'm gonna have to start playing my guitar or something!
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:34:17
Wow, I can totally do that.  It'll probably be over 1000 words because I can be pretty verbose, and there's a LOT of ground to cover.
Any parts in particular you're interested in?  I've got Army stories (no combat, thankfully), jail stories (a bit of combat there, unfortunately), cool homeless stories, less cool homeless stories, lots of drunk / high stories.  I even kicked a cop in the nuts once (it didn't end well for me).  Nothing is taboo - I'm not even slightly ashamed of the places I've been or things I've done.  That's not to say I've never made a regrettable decision - I just learned to accept my fallacies, learn from them, and move on.
I'm gonna finish my first couple beers of the day to get my brain-juices flowing, so it'll probably be an hour or so before I post it - just let me know if there's any details / themes you'd like me to focus more on.

I was kinda hoping I could link my prepaid card from the plasma center to coinbase, just because the final page looks like I'd be able to buy btc straight from there.
That'd be awesome, because then I could just buy a dollar's worth  of btc each time I donate (I already pay that much to get cash-back, or more to withdraw from ATM), and eventually have enough btc to buy something cool online.
If I can't link em directly like that, I'll just have to figure something else out.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:23:09
By that metric, I also "provide police protection, public schools, parks, libraries, roads, bridges, infrastructure to carry water &amp; electricity, emergency services, and the protection of the world's most powerful military to the people who live in America, free of charge, without choice."
Not all bank fees are evil, just like not all taxes are evil.  
If you do not want to pay bank fees, let the money sit in savings - you'll be just as protected under FDIC as Joe Billionaire.
Similarly, those who do not pay taxes still have the same access to those services as Reverse-Loophole Jones, who found a way to pay 90% of his income in taxes.
My point was that banks are safer than Bitcoin exchanges, not to start a debate about transaction fees and taxes.  Don't think me an anti-crypto nut, either - truth be told, I'm too broke to have Bitcoin OR a bank account.
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:06:07
Plasma, not blood.  They can't legally pay you for giving blood, and you'd only be able to give every 8 weeks, anyway.
With plasma, they're technically paying you for the inconvenience of being strapped to the machine for ~45minutes, and you can give twice per week.  Rates vary.
I highly encourage donating plasma - not just for the extra money, but because they use it make vaccines and it's WAY cheaper / easier to make in your body than in a lab.

Thanks man!  I just posted the reverbnation page bc I was leaving for the night.  I still have my same guitar and play it regularly (not nearly as much as I should).
I'll mess around with webcam and Youtube here in a bit.  I'll have to find my little book to see if I remember any other of my originals.  If I can't find one, I'll do another Hard Kid Blues (I added a verse since then, and changed the hyperbolic numbers to be slightly smaller) or maybe my acoustic version of The Who's The Seeker.
Thanks for the compliments, too.  I'll confess the rhythm comes from my bad habit of following the vocals.  If I brain-fart and it takes me a second to remember the words at the start of the verse, my fingers usually brain-fart for that second, too.
As for the melody, I'm kinda hooked on Am and company, especially changing the chords into sus2 and sus4 versions for that little twiddly sound.

The banks pay for that insurance.  The various fees and interest you pay on loans may go to that, but you are still covered even if your money just sits in the bank and you accrue no fees or penalties and have taken out no loans.
If a bank gets robbed, the money replaced doesn't just magically come out of nowhere.  That's why they have a vested interest in both physical AND electronic security.
You do not pay more when "I or someone else makes a mess" by ~~the~~ my bank getting robbed.  I'm really not even sure what you meant by that, unless you're just vocalizing a poor understanding of how insurance works.
As for Bitcoin and "I fuck up, I pay," that shifts the blame to those who've had their coins stolen.  Again, I'm confused to your meaning.  Using exchanges is a fuck up?  Having your bitcoins stolen is your own fault?
I'm not pro-fiat or anti-crypto by any means, but hyperbolic statements such as "Let us all steal and we will all get rich," are nothing but poorly constructed strawmen that add nothing to the discussion.
I want Bitcoin to succeed, even though I don't own a single bit.  Addressing these security flaws is the best way to make that happen.
You don't hear of any contemporary bank robberies where the bank's customers are financially ruined for the rest of their lives.  You also don't hear of a bank closing down and the owner leaving town with everyone's savings.

I think it was around that price when I started lurking.  Now that I'm officially in, I'm gonna start studying at all these factors that make the price rise and fall.
I'll probably go slightly sane just long enough to learn some new math / statistics stuff, then go completely insane trying to apply it.
Hell, I got excited today just watching the go up nearly a dollar per coin.  (admittedly, I briefly thought the price-per coin next to my name on coinbase was my balance) 
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:37:17
Holy cow that's cool!  I just set one up on coinbase, but someone reminded me that they're kinda like an exchange, too, so I'll have to set up a wallet that isn't.
No biggy - bitcoins seem pretty easy and quick to move around.  I already moved half my bits from changetip to coinbase just to see how fast.  It was ~5 minutes, but my internet connection is iffy so maybe faster.
@_date: 2015-07-02 01:44:49
Holy shit that's a lot of bitcoins.  Won't take as many to hit that same amount of US$ tomorrow, though.

Damn.  I was pissed at bitkeys for ~35$ in bitcoin they accepted (then never delivered Steam key) when the btc price was only $400ish.  It was the last of what I had (was gifted ~$50 in btc when price was ~$230/btc), so I just took it as a lesson learned and vowed to be more careful in the future.
I can't imagine how pissed I'd be if someone took 15 whole bitcoins, especially at current price.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:58:17
~$30-35 is still pretty good, though.  I'd feel rich if I had that much.
