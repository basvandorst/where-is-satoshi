So this failure is on BitGo as much as BFX - they talked it up as a close partnership, where they had an advisory role, they're providing a security service etc.
If the limits can be bypassed via their API, without the same controls you get from eg cold storage process (ie human intervention), then their security model is completely flawed, and they should bear liability.
Edit: Also, I still can't find anything about global limits. Is this just referring to the Spending Limit parameter used when creating long-lived access tokens via the Bitgo Dashboard, per [here](

They're almost certainly trying to figure out whether they are solvent. And given that ~70 million usd just walked out the door, there is every chance they are not.
They can't re-launch if insolvent, so the suggestion that they might do so soon was always optimistic at best, I'm not sure why Zane made it.

@_date: 2016-08-03 23:47:10
All they had to do was compromise Bitfinex assets actually (private keys + BitGo API key), because the BitGo API allows you to change account limits, and BitGo just signs everything you send it it it is signed with the first account key and under the limit.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:01:11

@_date: 2016-08-04 03:00:05
This is an intriguing idea, but I can think of a few things that make it unlikely. the most striking of which is that people who sent coins to BFX very shortly before the hack also got their funds moved.
Now maybe they did one last batch of sign requests with BitGo, but this is at least a bit surprising if they were really building uo signed transactions over months - why worry about sweeping up the last few hours worth of deposits?
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:20:29
It seems it may have been a way of navigating the CFTC requirements that there be "actual delivery" of underlying assets within 28 days. By giving everyone their own Bitgo wallets, and sending the bitcoins there, the idea is that there is delivery of the underlying commodity (Bitcoin).
Seems the CFTC were happy with this interpretation.
I believe this will also be the legal theory used to justify treating customer losses individually, if Bitfinex goes down this path. I expect this will result in lots of lawsuits.
In hindsight, the interpretation of this as being "actual delivery" is highly dubious as the user has none of the private keys, so it is really Bitfinex delivering the bitcoin to Bitfinex, not the user. I'm surprised the CFTC didn't see it that way.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:29:33
True in most cases - but for US margin traders the 3rd key was given to them, not held as a backup.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:08:11
Also as far as I can discern, limits are a per-wallet feature only. I'm still combing the API but I'm yet to find an enterprise-level withdrawal limit.
So BitGo was never a suitable replacement for a hot/cold wallet system, as there's nothing even remotely parallel to the controls put in place by cold storage.
Any lawyers around, want to comment on whether this supports a false advertising case or similar? They made numerous representations about safety.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:22:22
It's a 2-of-3 multisig setup. The three keys are held by:
* Bitgo
* Bitfinex
* Bitfinex (in cold storage aka "backup keys")
You say that Bitgo was not compromised, and that your backup keys were not compromised. 
If both those things are true, and it is truly 2-of-3, it is impossible to move funds from the address. 
So one of these statements is untrue:
 * We use (a correct implementation of) 2-of-3 multisig
 * Bitgo was not compromised
 * Backup keys were not compromised

For this to happen 50% of Bitcoins would have to get transferred to a sidechain, and then that sidechain would have to be attacked.
Which presumably, the attacker would only do in order to steal (reallocate) the sidechain coins to themselves. Which presumably they would only do in order to transfer the coins back as Bitcoins (since nobody would be interested in accepting the attacked sidechain's coins any longer, so they would be illiquid, this is the only way to unlock their value). 
So no overall change to the number of extant Bitcoins, and this whole example reduces to just a bitcoin-stealing scam (ie moving someone else's bitcoins to private keys you control), albeit with a novel attack vector.
Scams have been in bitcoin almost since the beginning, so doesn't your worry really just collapse to concern about a new scam vector?

My god, on the BTCtalk thread you scold someone for using 'inflation' to mean (the generally accepted definition) an increase of the price level, and point them to mises.org which explains the Mises version of inflation - apparently inflation means 'an expansion in the monetary base'. Which is bad because... mmmmmm because it is OK! Just reasons! 
So... an expansion of the monetary base is BAD according to Mises.org' and your newly spawned definition.
And yet here you are complaining about the exact OPPOSITE threat  - a reduction in the monetary base! Hmm, wait, what?
So dilution is bad, concentration is bad. Any change to the monetary base is bad.. because.. again REASONS.

OK, but any economist will tell you that BTC and BCH are nearly perfect substitutes, so hard forks resulting in 2 persistent "coins" (we both know that "coins" don't exist and are an artifact of human cognition) looks an awful lot like monetary inflation.

Things can have many differences and still be good substitutes.
Look at weed / alcohol. If there were no substitution effect, alcohol lobbies wouldn't have fought legalization so tooth and nail.
Altcoins are definitely a form of inflation.
I always thought that the "sound money" aspect was one of the least interesting or good things about Bitcoin. 
To me it is valuable because it allows programmable money, and all sorts of efficiencies, not because I am particularly anti central bank. It was also the only bearer asset I know of which allows fast global electronic peer to peer transfer of value (most altcoins obviously share this property these days). I think some central banks, especially those of Australia and NZ, have done a fantastic job &amp; continue to do so.
I actually think fixed supply is the reason Bitcoin will never be the numenaire for anything much.

This is a pretty good argument against the idea of 
Bitcoin (on-chain) needing to scale to coffee transactions. I tend to agree.
But one thing that I haven't seen spoken about much is something I think of as the "minimum enfranchisement cost". 
Bitcoin has been touted as a way to revolutionize money, to "be your own bank", and even as a way of extending electronic money to the developing world. It's been sold as peer-to-peer money, and as a great leveller. Furthermore, if it is ever to be truly successful at becoming a global *currency*, then adoption matters - and that means extending adoption all the way down the socio-economic scale.
"Owning Bitcoin" (in any quantity) means that there exists an unspent transaction output for which you possess the private key(s) necessary to sign a scriptsig that will satisfy the conditions placed in the output’s pubkey script.
Creating a UTXO costs whatever the on-chain transaction fee is. So to "own" bitcoin, there will always be a fixed cost proportional to the on-chain transaction cost.
If this is $100, as Adam Back has suggested he'd be happy with, then only the rich will ever be able to own Bitcoin, and mass adoption (as in, enfranchising on the order of billions of people) will be impossible.
Am I missing something? I don't see how Lightning or other off-chain solutions can solve this as long as "owning bitcoin" means having the ability to spend a UTXO.

The federation is a different thing from the members of a channel. I recommend you read Ruben's medium post.
Basically the federation are a semi trusted group of signers that are what allow for the transfer of utxos off chain with some cleverness. Key difference between this and federated sidechains is it is non custodial - ie the federation can't steal your bitcoin even if they all agree to do so 
One small wrinkle is that this is only true as long as they don't have the transitory key, ie at no point does a federation member become part of the utxo chain of custody. However if they did so and used it to steal coins, it would be immediately detectable and remaining participants would punish them by withdrawing all assets from the statechain and no longer trusting it.

The initial statement made it sound like they were totally incompatible. I was just pointing out that is not the case. BU-running miners will be building on the s2x chain, ie contributing their hash rate, at least until such time as one of those twenty incompatibilities causes them to diverge.
The fact that BU hasn't diverged from Bitcoin yet whilst clearly being run by some minders seems to be some evidence that it is possible to go a long while building on the same chain despite being 'incompatible'.
I've not bothered to look at source code for BU (I'm familiar with bitcoin and sw2x only), so why would I know how many ways it can diverge? Thank you for studying it and letting me know though, I'll take your word for it.

Monero is a fairly strong contender.
They are also reassuringly anti-speculator (I think Spagnoni convinced us all of that with his MEEA punking) unlike other coins that seem to be pretty focused on pumping their value (DASH) or are run as a business (Zcash).

Sure, and well done on finally providing some actual laws.
However, creating an altcoin is not a DOS or DDOS attack. So simply mining Segwit2X blocks is clearly not covered.
And what about a 51% attack? Well, in the case that the approach they take is to mine blocks but not broadcast them, and then release multiple blocks causing a re-org, that too doesn't fit any definition of denial of service under the laws. And re-orgs have happened before, with nobody complaining that it mounted to a DOS attack, or anyone pressing criminal charges.
Your only hope would be to argue that mining empty blocks is a denial of service attack, because it prevents the recording of transactions. This is a completely untested legal theory that even if you could find a jurisdiction in which to try the case, and a DA that was interested in it, seems pretty unlikely to hold up. Furthermore, miners could always say that there was no denial of service, because it was still perfectly possible to transact on the 2X chain, and frame it as an upgrade.
Finally, there is the fact that mining is semi-anonymous if you choose to make it so. I don't expect miners that mine empty blocks on the legacy chain will be putting their pool name in the coinbase tx, so then you have all the headache of proving that a certain IP mined a block, etc etc.
The things that make a decentralized currency robust to state interference also make your scenario of criminal prosecution for mining / 51% attacks completely absurd. You should be ashamed of yourself as a crypto enthusiasist for even suggesting such a thing is likely. Statist.

Yes. And that is a good thing. It avoids the need to rely so heavily on a fee market once mining rewards have tapered to ~0, which is the scenario that has worried thinkers and devs since at least 2011, and is one reason devs are so into having a block size limit.

Because none of those things are fully developed and in production, let alone being used, and some will require forks that may never eventuate?
What do you use for untraceable tx now? Are you not worried about blockchain analytics affecting fungibility? We've already seen plenty of real threats to Bitcoin's fungibility.
More to the point, zcash shows that privacy/untraceability has to be built in, not opt-in. Privacy comes from being one of the crowd, and opt-in privacy massively reduces the anonymity set.

There is nothing illegal about mining blocks, and S2X, whether you consider it an attack or no, is not covered by "computer hacking" laws, dumbass.
If it were, you would be able to tell me which law, and what part of the law it is specifically violating. But you are unable to do that.
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:51:11
I don't think so. Shorting alts to get the airdrop is gong to continue to be a popular strategy right up to the fork, and Bitfinex allows you to do so with leverage!

@_date: 2017-10-17 04:56:53
Thanks manginahunter, but unless you can produce some actual evidence / legal text or precedent that mining empty blocks, or mining many blocks and then releasing them all at once, violates the law, then you continue to hold the award for dumbest comment.
Just because people use the same word - attack - doesn't make something illegal.

It is possible to verify that that bug was never exploited on the Monero blockchain, as I understand it. Bytecoin was exploited however, apparently by its own devs (80% pre-mine wasn't enough for them?!)

If 80% of the miners don't adopt the softfork, there will be 4 non-SW blocks for every SW block.
UASF SW miners will reject blocks that don't signal for BIP141, meaning they will build on the previous block that did signal. Meanwhile, the non-SW miners will build on both types of block, but will follow the longest chain fork.
For there to be a chain split, all that has to happen is that after Aug 1 a non-SW signalling block (call it 101) is found, followed by another non-SW (call it 102) block.
From UASF perspective, neither of these blocks are valid, so it will build on top of block 100, with block 101s. But to the non-SW miners, that block is just an orphan, since it is on the shorter chain, and they will go on and build 103, 104, etc.
If the SW branch has less than 50% hash power, the approach of rejecting non-SW signalling blocks will cause a chain split. I'm not sure how you came to a different conclusion.
Also, there most certainly was a chain split when BIP66 was implemented.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:08:27

@_date: 2017-05-29 07:36:01
Can't pull out if you were never in. Ver is an idiot anyway.
What matters is whether the miners are on board, and whether they actually plan to activate Segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:35:55
A - These are not empty blocks, so don't help that much with using covert asicboost, and if anything would make it easier to detect (as there are less likely to be transactions with the same fees to switch places in the merkle tree in order to grind)
B - Even if these were empty blocks, all miners produce empty blocks, because of the advantage provided by prioritising the proof-of-work over getting transactions into the block.
C - The mempool is relatively empty at the moment, and these blocks were produced within 4 minutes of the previous block. It's possible that they grabbed a significant portion of the mempool.
D - Despite the name, covert AsicBoost should show up as deviation from the most common transaction ordering, which puts transactions with the highest fee per byte into the merkle tree first. Unless the merkle tree re-ordering (to grind the merkle root which is one of the ways Asicboost can work) is limited solely to transactions paying the same fee-per-byte, it will have a signature of deviations from this common ordering. This does not seem to occur anywhere.
E - There's literally never been any evidence that AsicBoost has ever been in use (see D), and there are some reasons to believe it is not. For instance, Antpool don't even use liquid cooling, which would give a significant efficiency boost for a reasonable capital investment. This seems like lower hanging fruit to me, and others in the industry such as Bitfury use it.

Well, there is a plan to adopt Segwit which is supported by a large chunk of the ecosystem and &gt; 80% of the hashpower. If you want Segwit, what is the problem?
@_date: 2017-07-21 07:37:47
I thought there must be something more than what he cited, perhaps going back to before May, when I started paying attention to all this stuff again. 
I mean using covert AsicBoost is pretty shady, but based on my research and the total absence of evidence for its use (*inb4 someone says covert means no evidence - yes even covert asicboost can leave a detectable signature*), I drew the conclusion that it is not in use.
Remote disabling ability does seem pretty dodgy - it's the sort of thing we'd expect of Apple, not a key figure in a crypto-anarchic movement.
The rest is mostly mudslinging, which I've built up a resistance to after months of tiresome mudfights.

Not activate, but lock in. Activation will be 336 blocks later.
@_date: 2017-07-10 05:21:45
Yep, that'd explain it. 248kB in the mempool at 21:52 according to that site, then there were blocks at 21:55:56 (Bitcoin.com), 22:01 (Bitclub), 22:06 (AntPool), 22:09 (Antpool). Not surprising they were not full - there may not have even been enough in the mempool to fill a block! 
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:17:36


Yeah, I said there will likely be a hard fork in Nov. There will. The only way that there won't be is if literally every miner running Segwit2x reverts to core. I put the chances of that at nearly zero.

Thanks! I'd actually forgotten that I had already read this! Lol.
I should probably reply to the mailing list, but some thoughts here:
- Using OP_RETURN means that the signal is actually coming from whoever last spent the coins, which may not be the same as the person that now controls them. This seems like a pretty big limitation.
- I guess the way you count is based on a snapshot in time? So there is no advantage to churning spend to generate extra votes, because that's not how it works?
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:30:40

You know that's not what you bet right? The bet was if "SW2X actively orphaning non bit 1 blocks before August 1st", you would lose and Jacob Eliosoff would win. You're right you could also lose if Segwit is active by Aug 1st, but that's the less substantive part of the bet.
The bet seemed to be about whether there would be a chain split - a bit different to "Segwit isn't active by Aug 1st". It's more along the lines of "BIP91 isn't active by Aug 1".
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:25:48

Yes, they are all supposed to be running Segwit2x nodes.
However, miners started signalling early - everything is kind of ahead of the schedule, unfortunately. SW2x locked in before it was even meant to start signalling.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:48:42
If Segwit2x gains momentum as a reference implementation, Garzik's role will end up looking more like Vlad's, as the project attracts more developers and builds an ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-07-19 04:00:05
I can't speak for others, but I've been calling this part of the SW2x activation BIP91 because idiots on this sub keep saying shit like "Segwit will [activate/lock in] this week".
It's been crystal clear from the beginning that bit 4 signalling was for NYA, and meant commitment to activation of Segwit at 80%
 (which they ultimately used BIP91 for) and a hard fork within 12 months (revised to 6 by NYA I believe).
Definitely keeping it at 12 months would have been smarter, and given Core less talking points, but I really don't think Core would have approached htings very differently had that been the case - they don't like giving over power, and losing control of the reference implementation will see their power diluted significantly.
And yeah, that may be a bad thing. Time will tell. I think this feels fairly one-off, and is a good compromise for this stage in Bitcin's dev, to move things forward from the current scaling stalemate. I think the silent majority will support SW2x.
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:58:50
The email you link to literally mentions "the Barry Silbert agreement" in its first sentence. It seems like that came first, and bit 4 came from that, but probably only people that were in the loop/actually at consensus at the time will be able to answer that.
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:48:24
By what logic?
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:18:23
It is, but Vaultoro's statement is essentially saying "we're not gonna do that". Which was the point of Ano-x's post.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:59:42
You are not counting segwit signalling. Might want to make that clear.
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:38:19
ven if it were merged to Core, which seems to be very much against their modus operandi, there is only 2.33 days to deploy the new version - ie it wouldn't make a big difference. You can run Segwit2x or JHilliards Segsignal if you want to enforce BIP91.
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:28:29
This could do with repeating it seems:


If your first statement is true, you have no reason to care about the existence of another implementation, whether it is radically altered or whether it is 99.9% the same except that it is called Buttcoin and includes fun posterior-themed branding.
Meh, I don't think there are really many added bugs. Such as they are they are really due to circumstances, and in theory eg BIP148 suffers exactly the same problem, if you're talking about the bug that this thread is about.
In practice, there is only 6% of hashpower signalling neither bit 1 nor bit 4. Once BIP91 locks in, all of the bit 4 signalling is guaranteed to also start signalling segwit. So there is a 6% chance of a single orphaned block, a less than 20% chance that block then gets built on by a non BIP91 miner, meaning the chance of a 2-block reorg is about 1%.
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:31:46
True, but the NYA said 6 months, which was then apparently interpreted to mean "within 6 months of the agreement", not within 6 moths of ssegwit activation. I'm as disappointed in this as anyone. Making it 3 months seems to be fairly irresponsible.
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:11:32
If nobody is in power there's absolutely no reason to get butthurt over the existence of another implementation, which I see many doing. 
This is how open source works, code gets forged, and merged, etc. People will choose to run what they choose to run.
Of course, bitcoin relies upon consensus for its function, so the latter actually matters a lot more. So you can't have it both ways
@_date: 2017-07-21 06:36:17
Yeah I don't really buy that narrative.
Nobody is using ASICBoost.
Antbleed was framed a very particular way, but did not seem to me as insidious as it was portrayed. Don't forget that there are people on each side trying very hard to spin the narrative to their advantage.
I agree that mining centralization is a massive concern, and the current position Antminer may even pose an existential threat to Bitcoin. But I think Jihan actually supports Segwit, provided he gets bigger blocks in exchange. If you interpret his behcious through the lense of him being a true believer, but perhaps with different beliefs to you, it does make a lot of sense.
@_date: 2017-07-21 07:34:04
Right I was referring to Peter Todd's explanation in that bit - which tried to explain the motivation for signalling bit 4 without bit 1.
I still can't think of any reason why they would do that (sginal bit 4/support NYA) it they don't intend to turn on bit 1.
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:41:19
Are you running an old client or something? Since they introduced checkpointing there is no signature verification for old blocks (though there is still transaction verification) and that was the most CPU-intensive part.
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:13:17
BIP148 doesn't orphan shit until Aug 1st I thought? Did they change the code to make it SEGSIGNAL (bit 4) aware?
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:06:02
And I never said it would.

@_date: 2017-07-12 10:03:39
Wasn't the whole argument about "economic majority" that UASFers used to talk up their fantasy game theory scenarios pretty much entirely about money changing what consensus means?
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:39:55
The current core developers are all against hard forks in general, and proposals mostly come from them (or are ignored). By the way, that state of affairs is only the result of "evaporative cooling of group beliefs" that saw Jeff, Hearn, Andreson - in effect, anyone for bigger blocks, excluded from Core.
@_date: 2017-07-10 05:49:36
Thanks, I wasn't pushing back against you, but against the general tenor of a vocal minority of posters here (I mean look at the OP in this thread!). The fact that you believe the same increases my confidence that Asicboost is not in use.
I think there is some confusion with terminology - I consider extranonce grinding to be "covert asicboost" as well.
There's a decent taxonomy in [this article]( - I think extranonce grinding and adding never-seen transactions both come under method b1 in the list.
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:06:14
Right, so they may get to be the cavalry, but given the early activation of BIP91, they are gonna be fucking late in that scenario.
It seems ludicrous for miners to not signal bit 1 after orphaning activates.
Also the "miners build on top of orphan blocks because of relay issues" is not very likely - the only scenario in which it happens is if a non-bit 1 signalling block is built on top of the current tip.
Once BIP91 orphaning starts, I expect less than 1% of hashpower to not be signaling for SW, and or that to go to zero fairly rapidly. Nobody likes losing money.
I know Peter Todd seems worried that the miners currently signalling version 20000010 won't flip bit 1, but I just cannot imagine any benefit of doing this - his "plausible deniability" scenario makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:14:22
This is incorrect. BIP91 wasn't used by any implementation anyway until it was included in SW2x.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:00:58
"Special subset of blocks"
"Not a chain split"
You are I denial, is all.
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:11:19
This thread started with the comment that "it's on github like bitcoin". Which it is. Talking about the email list does not contradict that, and is misdirection.
The email list has a different join policy to bitcoin-dev, but on the other hand whilst bitcoin-dev has no screening at sign up, it is more heavily moderated in course. There's trade offs between the two approaches, and the one sw2x has opted for reduces moderation overhead at the expense of participation. 
Personally I don't like that, but can understand them wanting to be able to focus their energies on other things.
Clearly it's not limited to NYA members, since I joined and am not such.
@_date: 2017-07-10 06:28:23
That's actually correct - Segwit does not block covert Asicboost. This has been [noted](
The hype over AsicBoost has been one of the things that has greatly impacted my opinion of Greg. I used to read bittcoin-dev on Bitcointalk and remember the original threads on CoinJoin, etc and have always been very impressed by him, but the framing of Asicboost as the key reason for Segwit being blocked by miners seemed like pure hype and political opportunism.
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:08:43

Then go back and read my second comment, where I specifically pointed out that I wasn't making any comment on whether the antecedent of the clause would happen. That was yet another clue.
You are arguing against a straw man. Not the sharpest tool in the shed are ya?
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:58:32
Bip 91 came *after* the Consensus announcement, which mentioned bit 4, so you have it arse backwards.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:01:45
But Peter Todd's whole argument for miners doing it this way instead of just never assigning the NYA seemed to hinge on plausible or some such. Just pointing out that that doesn't make sense
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:33:44
You're not wrong, and I did mention this in my last sentence.
But my point is you can't have it both ways - either open source projects implementing consensus systems are somehow special/different, in which case the position of maintainer actually does wield more power than in the typical model OR the open source model is correct and "nobody is in power" as btchip claims.
@_date: 2017-07-05 07:49:37
What is it about a hard fork that doubles the block weight exactly that makes it "crazy"?
You have suggested hard forking as a viable upgrade path in the past, so it can't be the hard fork part.
And the block weight part is within reasonable estimates of the sort of bandwidth available to most users, from what I can tell.
So what's the big issue? Seems like Not Invented Here syndrome.
@_date: 2017-07-13 02:02:45
This has not been the case so far. Obvious troll issues and people complaining/trying to rant about politics have been closed, but non-member issues have remained open.
You also neglected to mention the follow up from jgarzik clarifying this. Either you didn't scroll down, or, once again you are being selective in your framing in order to maximise FUD.


@_date: 2017-07-19 07:07:28
This could have been addressed by core actually incorporating larger blocks into their plans, and also not being so dogmatically against hard forks. There is nothing wrong with HF as an upgrade method.
The silent majority want 2x bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:53:20
Uh uh... And? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:04:23
My point was, if you mine a bunch of blocks with bit 1=0, in pretty short order you have to set bit 1 to 1 (and thus BIP91 compliant) to maintain plausible deniability.
And if Segwit signalling is above 95% on both sides of the chainsplit, which it would be once they switch back to signalling bit 1 after the "mistake", then it will activate on either side. So there's no "plausibly deniable" scenario in which they can prevent Segwit activation.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:23:51
I don't see how you can claim that knots is an implementation of the same protocol yet sw2x is not
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:13:44
You don't need to 'hope' - go read the Github and you can see the current state of discussions. Then forecast.
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:29:24
I don't think economic nodes are afraid to run sw2x software. Deployment just takes time, is all.
Though I support both SW activation and the 2x increase, I will say that the SW2x timeline has been uncomfortably rushed. I think the "inferior code" angle has been overblown though, but I do worry about the effect on the pool of developers that might come from the success of a new reference implementation.
Then again, many of the current core devs are paid by Blockstream, which in turn is dependent upon Bitcoin for its business model, so to the extent that they are happy to keep working there post SW2x, and to the extent that what emerges from the 2X hard fork is considered Bitcoin (ie if the money follow it), I expect Blockstream devs to follow.
Some may quit Blockstream if that's the way things go, I guess. That would seem to me to be cutting off your nose to spite your face, but *shrug*
@_date: 2017-07-12 10:13:15
I would like to see this. Is anyone working on it? Is there a BIP? Does it require a soft forking change itself?
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:57:27
Segwit signals on Bit 1, meaning the version string ends in 2.
Only 39 of the 100 version strings you posted end in 2. That means Segwit signalling is at 39%.

s/BIP-91 just activated/BIP-91 just locked in/
If it was activated, then I'd expect miners to be signalling Segwit, I mean why would they self-orphan?
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:31:10
You don't seems to understand logic then. My logic is perfectly sound.
You see, if indicates a conditional clause, and means that something implies another thing, conditional on the former occurring.
You seem to be inferring a statement regarding the likelihood of the antecedent, rather than simply the logical connection between antecedent and consequent. I made no such statement.
But then, having seen your other posts, this is not surprising - it's pretty clear that you're thick. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:50:14
UASF nodes won't relay blocks mined on a shorter-but-signalling SW chain until Aug 1st, so in the case that a non-SW block is the first one mined after BIP91 activation, they won't relay it.
So I'm not really able to follow what you're getting at. Unless UASF code has modified the P2P relaying to relay otherwise stale blocks prior to Aug 1?
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:51:44
Thanks this is useful. I'd been basing my judgement in part on Bitfury's advocacy of liquid cooling.
I would still love to see evidence that anyone is actually using covert Asicboost - it seems to me to be a strawman too. That's not to say I don't think we shouldn't prevent it. But the hysteria over it and Jihan seems overwrought/engineered.

Yes, bit 4 signalling signals not just the intention to orphan non-SW-signalling blocks come activation (of BIP91), but also the intention to hard fork to support 2x larger blocks, 3 months after Segwit activates.

Lol, people were calling Bitcoin a ponzi back then too.
Neither ETH nor BTC are ponzis, that much is obvious.
Some of the ICOs will inevitable turn out to be scams, or if we're more charitable, merely disastrous failures. Some of them may turn out be ponzis in fact. That doesn't imply ETH is one.
Bitcoin had a mania phase too, also replete with plenty of ponzis. Remember PirateAt40?

No it's not and never was. The NY agreement was to activate segwit as is, and then follow up with a HF no later than 6 months afterwards.

I expect Segwit to come to Bitcoin either sooner or later. But it's not going to happen via a minority chain split with a piddling amount of hash power.
Not to mention the bad precedent set by economically rewarding a tiny faction intent on winning a game of chicken.
I and many others are happy to wait for segwit on the longest chain. What you call "legacy" bitcoin, with 95% of the hashpower, but no SW is still more valuable than another chain with 5%, even if that chain has Segwit activated (and besides with only 5% sw would not even activate since it wouldn't even lock in by November). There are plenty of altcoins with segregated witness or similar, you don't see them overtaking Bitcoin.
So I don't really see how this ends with the market deciding that bip148 coin is more valuable.
And that's before we even touch on the problems of transacting on the minority chain.

Yes, which is why all the "no to segit2x,  UASF or bust" people are, from what I can tell, batshit crazy.
Getting segwit via COOP or segwit2x is the *best* possible outcome of pushing for UASF. It's a negotiating tactic (and a well studied one in game theory - see 'chicken').
At some point the psy-op/propaganda campaign became a victim of its own success, took on a life of its own and now you have deluded idiots that really think UASF is an end in itself, and not merely a means.
To those that haven't already, read Jimmy Song's medium piece on the UASF.

Clearly the guy who you asked discksizing questions like "have you even run a full node?" is an engineer too. You're the one trying to make a big deal out of that, not us.
And his engineering arguements appear to be rock solid - after all, increasing the block zise is just an engineering problem, and it comes down to calcualting the costs and detemrine if they are acceptable. at eg 4m blocks, even core appears to think that they are.

You seriously don't see ways to exit ETH to fiat? ETH/USD volume alone has outstripped ETH/BTC on several days recently. Add in EUR and fiat is higher than the crypto pair, and that's ignoring the (admittedly zero fee, ridiculous) Korean Won and JPY volumes!

Anyone running a full node could check that at any given moment. To be able to go back in time and look at snapshots of the mempool is another matter - that would require someone to specifically write some kind of archiving full node.
There's a few ways of doing Asicboost, and via Merkle-grind is one. And there's a few ways to grind the Merkle root:
- Change the coinbase transaction - this is the easiest, and compatible with empty blocks
- Rearrange/change transactions in the Merkle tree - there's a few different ways to approach this too
1. Use only mempool transactions, but rearrange where they appear in the tree. This may be detectable, but could in theory be completely covert. It's also worth noting that the cost of calculating the permutations of the merkle tree, subject to the contraints, grows as you include more transactions.
    Although there is no canonical transaction ordering, miners tend to include transactions in order of fees (subject to resolving intrablock transaction dependencies first). So this method may have a detectable pattern in so much as it diverges from this. In-place swaps between transactions having the same fees would avoid creating any pattern though, but means less permutations to grind (so less chance of generating a collision in the last 4 bytes of the Merkle root, which is how Asicboost works)
2. Add your own transactions that are not in the mempool, ie never-seen. This will be detectable - look for miners including a suspicious number of never-seen transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:21:31
I was more against the fork than for it at the time, but now we've got some distance from it, I can see that it was actually a really good thing, because all the ideologues that are never willing to compromise forked off and focused their energies on another project. The community that was left is a lot healthier, and more able to accept change.
Bitcoin's biggest problem right now is that the ideologues (on both sides) are still very much here.

There's plenty of evidence that there exist many users want want a base block size increase though. You only need some for the currency to continue to exist.
This is the nature of Nakamoto consensus - miners get a veto, and users don't. Only a consensus of users can block miners (is it is not a veto, which by definition need only be exercised by a single actor to bind) . A plurality of miners, the other hand, is likely enough to at ensure a viable fork (but may not be enough to guarantee there is no surviving other fork).
@_date: 2017-07-12 10:02:20


I don't think that's correct.
I've felt very welcomed there, whereas I've been too scared to post to bitcoin-dev, for instance, because I guess I'd be moderated because I'm just a nobody.
They certainly haven't limited participation to "members" - I was even added to the mailing list, without so much as a pointed question or query email. I do not have any reputation in the bitcoin space - perhaps this is why?

The opposition to hard forks has been almost entirely fomented by core, so I believe that if they wanted to make one happen, they could have pulled off a non contentious hard fork. That ship has now sailed, for no real good reason. 
Furthermore they've shot themselves in the foot for when they will need to use it as an upgrade path (eg for spoonnet) by making it a dogmatic issue, now with separate banner-waving teams.
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:30:02
I'm familiar with the code, thanks. It doesn't explain how Segwit (that is bip141) can activate before Aug 1.
Did you even read my post? Segwit takes 2016 blocks to lock in and another 2016 to activate.
Just admit you were wrong, or explain how you think we would get to 95% signalling before July 8. Those are the two options.
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:11:36
Not true for SPV wallet users, as this is what Adam Back calls a "simple hard fork".
Full nodes will need to upgrade yes. Miners will already be running Segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:44:47


To sell your UASF coins you have to send them to the exchange. Without sellers there are no buyers. Without either there is no price discovery. Without price discovery there is no economic argument.


It is disingenuous beyond belief to take this sort of line, and then claim that Segwit2x is impossible to write, test, deploy within target timeframe. One or the other, can't be both.

"Unlikely BIP148 happens"
What do you think you mean by "happens"? It's a flag day activation and people are already running it. Unless there's literally not a single node or miner running it on aug 1, it is guaranteed to happen.
I think what you mean is it's unlikely to succeed. Well yeah, that's blindingly obvious.
Re replay protection you can check my post history.
As for miners following the money, that was always a dumb argument, as without exchange support there is no money, and I've pointed out why it's unlikely exchanges will support bip148 - hell, even if they wanted to it's close to technically infeasible!
That's before you factor in the fact that Jihan can absorb substantial losses in order to succeed, and has the luxury of not following the money.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:16:53
I don't understand what you're referring to.
For every seller, there is a buyer. The Bitcoins that were held by Chinese exchanges were 'trapped' - they wren't going anywhere. Now they are not, and can be sold for USD, when they couldn't before.
There is literally no way that everyone on the Chinese exchanges could have "sold through all the uncertainty", for every seller there was a buyer. So yes, I **know* that some people did not sell through all the uncertainty.
The total amount of BTC suddenly becoming available to sell for USD is unchanged by your logic.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:21:00
Right, so the only difference between what you call 'real' full nodes and pruning full nodes is the ability to send others the early blocks.
But how much do these blocks actually affect security? It seems like not much. Even in the extreme case of only a single real full node (with very high bandwidth), I don't see what the realistic attack vector is, particularly if pruning nodes keep say two weeks by default.
Each of the pruning nodes has confirmed for itself, from the genesis block to now, that the current state is true. And the single-real-node can't trick/cheat any new full node that spins up, because any historical blocks it serves have to arrive at the same state that all the full nodes say is true.
Basically the security model of everyone keeping every block since the genesis block is overengineered. And past bitcoin devs, Satoshi included, seemed to be of this opinion too. To the the extent that it disagrees, current dev consensus seems to be more a result of "evaporative cooling of group beliefs" more than anything else.
And with checkpointing, that already tiny attack vector basically disappears.
The only surprising thing is that checkpointing is not already implemented. Satoshi first spoke of including it in 2010 I believe.

I asked about bip 148 support. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:19:47
You honestly believe that BIP148 will have &gt; 50% of hashpower?
Why do you believe this?
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:25:40
One thing I don't understand is that Segwit (BIP141) deployment is still using BIP9, which requires 95% of a retargeting period (1916 of 2016 blocks) to lock in. But Segwit2x signalling only starts on July 21, so there isn't enough time to lock in SW before Aug 1. 
Edit: Nevermind, it didn't occur to me that all that is necessary is for BIP91 to activate, since this also orphans non bit-1 signalling blocks. So UASF will still occur, but if BIP91 is locked in, it will have no effect since the network is already orphaning non bit-1 signalling blocks.
So we should expect Segwit to lock in 13.3 days (1916 blocks, since 100% of blocks will be signalling) after BIP91 locks in. And as long as BIP91 locks in before Aug 1st, UASF will have no effect.
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:54:35
You're confusing activation with existence.
Sefwit2x will have code for a hard fork to 2x block size, but that hf doesn't happen until 3 months after Segwit activation.
@_date: 2017-06-04 16:48:48
What does success look like on August 1st? If they continue to have fuck all hashpower then all they really can do is bluff.
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:12:02
But doing so wouldn't have included the 2x block size upgrade path. By creating a signalling mechanism that means Segwit + hard fork, which is precisely what bit 4 means, they create a coordination point, and at the very least introduce social costs for defection.
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:04:17
BIP148 is what forks the chain silly - it ignores the longest chain, and builds on it's own "I'm not playing with you anymore" chain that won't talk to anyone not wearing a UASF hat (ie signalling bit 1).
But at hashpower of say 0.5% of the current total (current tally is 0.2%), it will take a day and a half to find the second block on the UASF chain. In that time, everyone that is still running Bitcoin Core, ie the default, where they haven't made up new rules that require hat-wearing, will see the main chain grow another 300+ blocks.
And all the UASF miners in this time are losing money, since the likelihood of the BIP148 chain being abandoned if it's taking &gt; a day just to get the next block, is very high.
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:08:32

@_date: 2017-06-13 01:45:52


If you were around in Bitcoin / on the forums in 2013, Ethtrader actually feels almost identical atm.
I agree that SEC action on ICOs is an obvious thing that will happen - not a matter of *if* but *when*, and that ICOs are a big factor (but nowhere near the only factor) in driving ETH prices. But if you look at the Trendon Shavers case, for instance, it's pretty clear that the SEC simply doesn't move all that fast. I would be pretty surprised if action on ICOs comes in under 6 months, and I'm betting it's more like 12 months away.
Given the UASF nonsense, Bitcoin also has huge volatility and downside risk in the near term, particularly if the UASF wahhabists follow through with their intent to sell all their 'legacy' bitcoins to try and drive up the relative price of UASF coins and get miners to switch chains.
I think a hell of a lot of people are dollar cost averaging into ETH too. ETH has built a vibrant community and a HODL culture in the same way BTC has. At this point it's not cleae to me what the big differentiator is meant to be or what is meant to assure BTC market dominance. 
I see a bright future for both, but unless Bitcoin solves scaling it's quite likely that ETH will overtake it, at least until ETH's own scaling problems become more obvious. I'm not suggesting that's rational - ETH *will* have scaling problems and they may be as painful as Bitcoins. But people seem to be very bad at looking far ahead - availability bias etc, so it's probably not until later this year that anyone will start to successfully raise concern re: Eth and scaling. Until then Bitcoin has a drag on it, and Eth has a tailwind.

How do you expect Segwit to activate prior to August 1st? Its confirmation window is 1916 of 2016 blocks, and it is currently at 30% signalling.
Once the BIP91 soft fork occurs, 100% of blocks will be signalling Segwit, but it will still take around 1800 blocks to lock in, and then another 2016 blocks before activation.
Even if Segwit signalling went to 95% tomorrow, it still would not activate until around July 19-20th. And if you tell me you expect it to go to 95% signalling before the BIP91 soft fork, I will simply laugh at you.

You were talking about UASF remember?  Fork being the operative word. If there's only one chain, there's no fork.

What the fuck are you talking about? I asked you to explain, not to restate the thing I asked you to explain. You have my attention.
Luke-jr himself describes only two methods for splitting, and they *both* involve transactions on the UASF chain.


**Falls off chair**. But I thought re-org risk was the number one reason why UASF was guaranteed to succeed? You have to admit this talking point has been bandied about as such by many (I will admit you changed your tune on this front a little while ago and ackowledged that a SF will likely happen to prevent reorg)


According to you there are already multiple exchanges. I don't see anyone else jumping on board. And you didn;t address my point of how unrealistic that is now given the timeframe to develop and test the code needed to allow for doing so before Aug 1.
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:45:36
It includes BIP141 aka Segwit, so it gets rid of ASICBOOST to the exact same extent as Segwit as written by core, that is it deals with most of the covert asicboost vectors, but leaves some vectors open.
My understanding is that it [prevents merkle tree grinding, but does not prevent coinbase grinding](
However there's pretty convincing evidence that nobody is using asicboost atm - BitMain aren't even using liquid cooling in their mining deployment, and this would almost certainly be lower-hanging fruit than the quite-hard-to implement covert asicboost.
Furthermore, even "covert" merkle grinding based asicboost should show up in the ordering of transactions in the block, and nobody seems to be making blocks that match the expected statistical pattern from doing so. See [here](
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:16:48
That was precisely my point. Fortunative wanted to explain it away by saying it was probably just an overzealous BIP148 supporter that wrote it, and thus not representative of the actual Core devs positions.
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:32:52
Uhhh you know that as soon as BIP91 activates, Segwit2x code starts signalling on bit 1 right?
IE the code being deployed will signal on bit 1.
Also there is really no mechanism I can think of by which flipping an nversion bit could affect anything more broadly, such as asicboost.
Maybe you need to work on your paranioa?

If by Bitcoin Core you refer only to the free software project, the people with commit access to the repo have the power to commit Bitcoin Core to things, and are the only ones with meaningful power to do so.




According to [this list of Segwit support from Core developers]( 70% approve (green boxes) of BIP148.




Much of the contribution has been adversarial, see eg Greg Maxwell accusing jgarzik of trying to exclude asicboost fixes from Seqwit2x when there was no evidence of any such intent. Then there are people like earonesty actively calling for a bait-and-switch, which erodes trust and certainly undermines any attempt at ageement.


The same is true of the ridiculous UASF chain. I expect both chains to fail, and I think Jihan probably does too. But by doing this he turns many the arguments of the UASF zealots back on themselves. It also raises the stakes, and makes the success of the NY agreement a double-or-nothing affair. 
Personally I wish he wouldn't do this, and am glad I sold a lot of my coins, because it is going to be even messier than I expected come Aug 1st. But I can see the logic and tactics behind the action.
I disagree with Jihan re weight, and also think there is nothing to be concerned over re: SW patents - but it's also worth emphasizing that nowhere does he say that SW patents are a problem. Only that adopting SW is conditional on confirming that patents are not a problem. Doing this properly will take time and legal advice.

The forsk you are referring to were supported by the miners. They are miner activated soft forks.
There has never been a UASF, because it would, by definition, not have many miners, and it would likely fail as a result. The concept of UASF is incoherent.

James Hilliard has now updated the pull request so that it is 336 block confirmation window, and a 336 block lock in period. This seems to be almost  a Pareto improvement over the previous way, the only downside you could argue is that confirmation will be subject to greater variance, so it is more likely to go over 80% due to luck (also more likely to go under 80% due to luck - basically luck will have more effect).
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:45:15


But to maintain plausible deniability, they would have to go back to accepting only bit signalling blocks, and so we'd still see 95% SW signalling and thus Segwit activation.

What do you mean by "handle" BIP148? What are you proposing they do, in concrete terms?
BIP 148 looks to have less than 1% of hashpower. Unless that changes, it means the following:
- Transacting on the UASF chain will be nearly impossible. One block per day. If you think fees are high to get into blocks when they're every ten minutes, well, hah.
- Replay protection (aka splitting the two different coins) will be very hard. The methods that rely on transacting on the UASF chain (coinjoin to UASF chain coinbase transaction, double spend to different addresses on each chain until you get different outputs on each chain), will pretty much not work at all. The only other method for splitting is coinjoin to coinbase transaction on the main chain, but that requires miner cooperation, and if I were a miner against UASF I simply wouldn't mine your coinjoin transaction as it's obviously to facilitate splitting. 
If by "handle" you mean list both coins, and allow people to buy and sell, that seems to be practically impossible to implement, since there is no guarantee that transactions on the UASF will be possible. So deposits and withdrawals of UASF coins is not possible.
And indeed, even UASF proponents have said that they don't plan to make any transactions in the wake of Aug 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:18:11
UASF currently has 0.2% of hash rate, and no major exchanges planning to support it.
On the latter, it also seems pretty unlikely that exchanges will choose to list UASF148 coins, because replay protection is going to be very, very cumbersome. And that is true even if block times are not multiple hours or days, which they will be if hashpower doen't increase on the order of 100x from where it is. The "economic" success is actually self-limiting, because the more demand there is for transactions to split coins, the more expensive splitting will be.
Without the exchanges allowing speculation on the different chain's coins, I don't see how even the economic argument makes sense.
Furthermore, with less than 10% of hashpower, the UASF would fail even to lock in Segwit by November *on its own chain*, meaning that without sufficient hashpower it is likely to fail, even on its own fairly bizarre terms.
Saying "Oh I'm sure UASF will be a success" and then when called out on how that is unrealistic, responding "Oh well what I actually meant was MASF will be a success but I'm refusing to call it that for obtuse reasons" is just pathetic, but seems to be characteristic of the intellectual dishonesty of UASF zealots.

The Bitcoin was only available to sell for CNY on the exchange that held the bitcoin. There was no way to buy Bitcoin (defined as controlling the private key) on Chinese exchanges.
No way to buy certainly reduces demand and creates downward pressure.
Conversely, there was no way to sell 'BTC' (not really bitcoin, but an IOU for Bitcoin since no private key) held by Chinese exchanges for other currencies eg USD. This somewhat reduced demand for USD across the BTCUSD pair (and other fiat pairs like BTCEUR).
The sudden possibility of withdrawing the stock of bitcoin from Chinese exchanges and selling for eg. USD creates downward pressure on BTCUSD price.
So those are the first-order effects - upwards pressure on BTCCNY, downwards on BTCUSD. As I mentioned though, there are second order effects due to sentiment, which will also drive price action.

Huh? That's the current hashpower signalling BIP148, and it has stopped growing.
The economic arguments don't work, because there are very few ways an exchange can feasibly list the 148 coins for trade, due to the impossibility of transacting on the chain (see my post history for more on this). The best you can do looks something like [ViaBTC's solution](

Where are the forks? A fork implies splitting into two - one chain goes down one fork, another goes down another fork. None of the UASF actually forked. If they had have forked off, ie if miners hadn't capitulated to their ultimatum, they would be on a minority chain. The fact that that has never happened means there has never been an actual UAS *fork*, with fork being the operative word.

2mb blocks will certainly improve the situation, but yes only at the margins. I agree that attempting on-chain scaling to say visa levels isn't desirable.
The segwit discount is framed as though there's only one way to look at the issue, but at least one problematic aspect of utxo bloat is actually implementation specific, so the witness discount is at least partly core trying to tweak incentives to make up for their chosen architecture. Other solutions such as bitcrust don't rely on tracking all utxo s and already outperform core code.

What odds do you give to bip148 getting over 50% hashpower? 
Are you willing to bet at those odds? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:56:41
Yes, but splitting them either means following [Luke's nLockTime method]( which is not guaranteed to work (since you'll need to pay a big transaction fee on the minority chain to get in the rare blocks, it is likely that the same transaction is mined on the main chain), or using Coinjoin to coinbase transactions, which means waiting 100 blocks for the coinbase coins to mature - ie around two months.
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:00:09
Replay issues are not overblown. Withdrawing from an exchange will be basically impossible. That has an effect (see eg China).
Also, you seem to be assuming that the best course of action is to *keep your coins on an exchange* through the split, which is the opposite of most of the advice I've seen. Sending your majority-chain coins to an exchange means sending your BIP148 coins to the exchange, unless you split them yourself first. If the exchange doesn't support BIP148 coins then you are giving them away when you do that (as people that sent ETH to Coinbase learnt of the ETC they'd also inadvertantly sent)
Particularly if the minority chain has &lt; 1% of hashpower, meaning 1000 minute (16hr) block times. With only 1MB of transaction space, the first block has room for say 3-4000 transactions. That is the only opportunity to split coins, so transaction fees are going to be crazy - perhaps as much as 10-20% (given that we are seeing as high as 1% on the main chain already, with 100x the throughput!). 
The 4-5 exchanges supporting BIP148 are bit players. Bitfinex have clarified on Reddit that they have made no public statement saying they will list BIP148 coins, and that they are remaining "neutral". 
Furthermore they would have to code, test and deploy replay protection that appears to be exceedingly complex and not even guaranteed to work practically, depending on BIP148 hashpower. Given the noise being made about the Segwit2x timeline being unrealistic, this seems even more unlikely to happen. I've seen no code in the wild to handle replay protection, yet the flag day is less than 60 days away.


You're going to have to explain this. My understanding is that it is impossible to split without transacting on the chain. There are two mechanisms proposed - coinjoin with coinbase transactions (or with coins previously split in this same way - at least creating a 'snowball' of split coins), or using nLockTime and spending differently on the two chains. Only the former is guaranteed to work, the latter *may* work but is not guaranteed to do so.
For your economic argument to hold, of course you need to transact on the UASF chain. Without transactions there is no economy. And arguing that it will all happen offchain, in the databases of exchanges, is an argument against the value of the chain, not for.


Your argument hinges on on the largest exchanges listing BIP148, when I have pointed out several reasons why this is unlikely.
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:24:52
Finally an answer!
OK, that would work. That's definitely going to be the best way to split coins - coinjoin transactions to majority-chain coinbase tx. Makes sense. Also means you only have to wait 16 hours to spend them, instead of 2 months on the minority chain.
Still doesn't resolve the issues around there being so little throughput on the minority chain that transacting will be nigh impossible, and on the insanely short timeframes for exchanges to prepare to interact with two chains.
Given that your whole argument seems to hinge on UASF coins being listed on major exchanges, those seem like pretty big issues.
Would you care to make a bet as to whether one of the more neutral exchanges, say Kraken, lists BIP148 coins by Aug 1st?
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:31:49

Hashrate is a badly misunderstood metric. A hash != a hash when the POW protocol differs. What matters is the cost of hashpower.
 The current capex required to replicate the ETH network hashpower is around $318M. The current capex required to replicate the BTC network hashpower is around $412M.
See my comment history for the calculations.

Right, and flipping a coin doesn't necessarily lead to a heads or tails result. But we don't devote much time considering that because it's extremely unlikely.

Dude, you didn't answer the question at all. Explain why you believe there is a solution to replay attacks, in the case that the BIP148 chain splits with &lt; 1% of total hashpower.
If there isn't then what you're demanding wallet providers to implement is technically impossible. So you should probably be certain that it is in fact possible, before demanding it.
It's fairly apparent that you have no clue about replay protection though, so you don't know whether replay protection/a practical way to split the coins exists.
I do, and it will be very difficult, if not impossible, based on the likely conditions at the chain split.

Thank you for explaining, and I take back the full of shit comment. I've also tagged you in our sockpuppet database as you suggest ;)
However you are still mistaken about pruning nodes not relaying blocks. They have done this since Bitcoin Core v12.0 - check the [release notes](


Here, compatible peers just means any peer that supports sendHeaders() (ie with protocol version &gt;= 70012).
If we look at what the code actually does, we can see where you went astray. There are a few reasons:
- First of all, the restrictions you refer to is only for outbound connections. A pruning node will still connect to peers, and will end up in that peers vNode vector of connected peers, as there is no logic filtering *inbound* peers based on nRelevantServices service bits. This means that pruned notes will still receive and relay blocks to their peers, it's just that they will have less inbound peers.
- Second of all, even when making outbound connections, the initial construction of the p2p network does not always filter on nRelevantServices equal to REQUIRED_SERVICES. If it doesn't yet 
have at least 50% of its max outbound peers, and it has failed to find a peer 40 times in a row when sending out feelers, it will connect to outbound peers without REQUIRED_SERVICES. That is, th code you reference shows that nodes will connect preferentially to non-pruning nodes (though they will still connect to pruning nodes if they can't find enough nodes after trying a bunch of times, see [net.cpp:1814](


Finally, [this piece of code]( seems to pretty conclusively show that pruning nodes do send blocks:
    // Pruned nodes may have deleted the block, so check whether
    // it's available before trying to send.
    if (send &amp;&amp; (mi-&gt;second-&gt;nStatus &amp; BLOCK_HAVE_DATA))

If Segwit2x signalling only begins on July 21, option 1) from your list is impossible. It will be option 2, enforced by activation of BIP91 by segwit2x deployment.

Can grow and *will grow* are two very different things. As other have pointed out, with Segwit2x, the blockchain will grow at around twice the rate it would grow with Segwit, so ~
By your own logic, with just Segwit "the blockchain can grow by [210GB]" per year. 
I also don't see why your answer excludes pruning - the actual amount of data needed to be stored will be much less if you prune, with no loss of security. I don't see why people can't run pruned-mode, a pruning node is still fully validating, and I'm fairly sure that it does forward blocks, I don't know where you got the idea that it doesn't.
Finally, you seem to be assuming that UASF can be effective, when there is really no evidence of this yet. The most likely outcome on Aug 1st would have been a chain split that was ultimately abandoned - less then 1% of hashpower simply isn't enough given Bitcoin's long difficulty retargeting period.

@_date: 2017-06-16 02:23:14
Me too. Even a day between lock-in and activation would be nice. As it stands, with a 672 block signalling window, here is the amount of grace time miners would get to switch over to signalling bit 1 to avoid being orphaned. 
- Exactly 80% support = No expected grace period (as the 538th block signalling bit 4 is expected to arrive in the very last possible block (ie 672nd in the relevant window) it can to still lock in (and may in fact not for any given window due to variance).
- 85% support = Expected grace period of ~29 blocks, as the 538th block signalling bit 4 is expected to arrive around the 633rd block in the window.
- 90% support = Expected grace period of ~75 blocks, as the 538th block signalling bit 4 is expected to arrive around the 597th block in the window.
- 95% support = Expected grace period of ~106 blocks, as the 538th block signalling bit 4 is expected to arrive around the 566th block in the window.
So the more support it gets above 80% the more time other miners will have to switch to signalling bit 1 on lock-in.
It seems even a lock-in period of eg 75 blocks would have a big effect - the difference being equivalent to signalling being at 90% rather than 80%.

You've misunderstood the Segwit2x code it you think this. These changes mean that Segwit is much more likely to activate before Aug 1, making the UASF unnecessary. Activation of bit 1 signalling (and orphaning blocks not signalling bit 1) will be via BIP91, which will lead to activation of Segwit (BIP141) via BIP9.
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:31:43
Until the hard fork, yes, it is. It is activating BIP141.
Funnily enough, it's doing it via the exact same mechanism BIP148 attempts to use - that is, orphaning any blocks that don't signal for segwit. After BIP91 (which Segwit2x implements) locks in, 100% of blocks on the main chain will signal bit 1 for Segwit, and segwit will lock in around 13 days later.

Or the narrow 'digital gold', libertarian, ancap, ideologically motivated solution? Why is immutability even important other than ideology? After all, if mutability were really important per se and not just ideologically, wouldn't the immutable ETC be worth more than the mutable ETH?
It's also hard to argue that ETH doesn't have decentralized governance at the network level. Your comment is about the political level - ie centralization of political power in guiding the protocol.

Those that do so will have lost the moral high ground. The optics are bad. You can expect some part of the community to label their chain "Liarcoin" or similar, I would guess. I doubt that many miners will renege, but we'll see. Exchange support will be an important component.
For those that don't change the code they run, the hard fork will essentially be a flag day. It seems likely to have &gt; 51% of hashpower given the signatories and their existing alignments (hell, even BU got &gt; 40% signalling and yes we know that plenty signalled only, didn't run it, the point is expressing willingness to have big blocks)

Jihan has said he supports Segwit2x, even as recently as the Bitmain blog about UAHF.
He's also said that if UASF forks with any substantial amount of hash power, he will split the chain too with a UAHF.
Segwit2x activating BIP91 before Aug 1st is pretty much the only way to avoid the nightmare scenario of 3 chains.
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:08:47
It's not possible because the result won't be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:32:18
Jihan is only against SW if there is nothing in return. He wants bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:31:48
It does, which is why SW will actually only lock in *after* Aug 1st. But Segwit2x being made compatible with BIP91 is important because it means it will already be orphaning non bit-1 blocks when UASF starts doing so, so UASF will follow the Segwit2x chain, not start its own.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:24:32
But it will increase the number of people that can use bitcoin, as lowered transaction costs lowers the barriers to use. Those are counterbalancing forces, and as JustSomeBadAdvice sensibly pointed out, when it costs a few dollars a year to run a node, vs a few dollars a year to send a transaction (which, btw, Lightning Network will pay too as it needs to open/close channels), then the balance is not right.
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:41:40
The fact that he referred to 51% made me assume he meant hashrate. There is nothing special about having 51% of nodes vs &lt; 50%.

It's a soft fork involving a chain split, but the distinction people are drawing is overdone. A chain split like that has the potential to do just as much damage to the ecosystem as a contentious hard fork.

I don't see why a pruning node is not a "real" full node though. I mean there's only one use case that it fails to meet right, which is a getblocks that extends to below the pruning height? 
I appreciate the explanation btw.
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:49:09
Without miners there is no chain. If &gt;80% of miners stick with Segwit2x it will be Bitcoin. That will certainly happen if exchanges jump on board, and two bid ones already have. So far the businesses I've seen speak about it are supportive of the compromise. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:41:18
Well, certainly what you are saying is possible. But I think the economic majority will support the compromise upgrade patch, including the hardfork.
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:20:01


He said hard fork code, not hard fork. You're right, the event and process leading up to it is never going to be simple. The code certainly can be simple.

It's only useful for the rich. It will never be used by a significant fraction of the world population if it costs $2-5 to transact.

Jeff Garzik seems to be doing plenty of coding.
The best team would certainly include somebody like Gavin.
And you can't pretend that the Core team wouldn't be a better team if Luke-jr were simply not involved.
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:30:58
Not sure how to interpret.
You think this is not primarily motivated by saving face? I tend to agree - it's a gesture of goodwill in the hopes of generating sufficient reciprocal goodwill that a compromise will actually be supported and they get 2x larger blocks.
Or did you mean that this is not face saving at all, and you have something else in mind that this is? 
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:46:02


But this describes very few miners.

If &gt; 80% of mining power run BTC1 Core for Segwit2x, they will hard fork 3 months after segwit activation, per the current code.
So the only question is what % of mining power is going to defect post SW-activation.

Eth doesn't get burnt when used as gas.
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:47:03
Not really correct to say that the BIP 148 chain will have 80% of the hashpower. The Segwit2x chain will have &gt; 80% of the hashpower, if it activates. That means &gt; 80% of that hashpower will have signalled Bit 4.
Bit 4 signalling means two things:
- Enforcing bit 1 signalling once activation occurs
- A hard fork to 2x larger blocks, 3 months after Segwit activates 
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:45:36
Good points, but I'm still surprised, even alarmed by the level of indicated support.
A reasonable response to the sheer insanity of BIP148 would be to remove Luke-jr from the Core team.
They kicked Gavin out for much less.
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:29:21
Those that have private keys at least. There are coins that have been sent to addresses that don't have any private key (ie BitcoinEater)

I am taking into account reorg risk. There is zero reorganization risk of UASF remains below 10%.
And even at 10%, that's nearly two hour block time. There's not enough transaction throughput on the current network, how will a 10x slower network support the kind of value transfer needed to support the higher prices needed to get miners to switch chains? 
If I am an exchange, it barely even makes sense to list the UASF chain since on-chain transfers can only happen every couple hours! Have fun waiting for deposit/withdrawal! 
And that's in the wildly optimistic case that UASF gets 10% of hash power! 
I'd bet it doesn't even get 5%.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:14:53
Slush pool, the only pool mining bip148 with more than a terrahash of power (the other two have a few hundred GH between them). Currently at 16PH/s, which is around 0.3% of total network hashpower.
Soon to be irrelevant anyway due to Segwit2x deployment.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:27:47
What evidence do you have for this?
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:21:05
How do you propose to transact on a chain with 0.3% hashpower? It will find a block less than once a day. Please explain, I'm all ears.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:31:13
There is no "later on" if they are running segwit2x. The hard fork code is already in there. So for miners unlikely to be a problem. For non-miners that don't upgrade, they will end up following the shorter chain unless they upgrade. Luke-jr's idea of a software fork would be a good idea to ensue that the minority chain is abandoned.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:26:39
If there is any chance of the UASF being successful, ie leading to a re-org, nobody will want to transact on the other (longer/main) chain in the meantime, rendering Bitcoin completely useless in the interim due to uncertainty.
Exen gmaxwell doesn't agree that BIP148 is "not a hardfork". From IRC:
6:01 am gmaxwell: luke-jr: I don't think it's that precise to say that it isn't a hardfork. In the sense that there is a nearly guarenteed hardfork (a miner violating it) which will happen.
6:01 am sipa: luke-jr: apologies for the ad hominem... but i believe your argument it nonsense
6:02 am gmaxwell: luke-jr: with softforks we have historically staged things to minimize the risk of block orphaning, so no hardforked blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:01:53
OK. I think I understand.
Elsewhere I've interpreted your comments as being veiled hints that you think miners *should* defect after segwit activates, and I have called into question your honesty as a result.
However, I may have been confusing the is/ought distinction, so would like to give you the benefit of the doubt.
Was your point merely that there are no guarantees after Segwit activates, that there is literally no way to force anyone to run any code vs any other?
Or were you literally endorsing the idea of running Segwit2x only to get SW, then defecting?
Your final sentece does seem to be hinting that you think a significant portion of miners are only going to run Segwit2x because they see it as the only way to get Segwit. Do you really think they will then switch back to running something else?
If so, do you have insight into why?
Is it just pragmatism - Core code is more trusted?
Is it ideologicial - they are very anti HF and/or anti bigger blocks?
Is it some other reason?
Miners seem to be mostly profit motivated from my view - if users and exchanges decide that the longest chain post-HF is "Bitcoin", miners will mine that, or at least mine the chains in proportion to their price vs difficulty.
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:08:33
I hadn't thought about that, good point! 
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:36:04

In the short term the summed market cap is likely to be less than the value of the unitary coin pre split. A chain split is bad for bitcoin and all its descendents.
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:36:38
No, consensus emerges from miners + nodes.
There is no way for nodes to '"agree" with each other, they can only "disagree" with miners, and even that only a block at a time. Miners "agree" with each other by choosing to build on each others blocks. So if you think about what the word consensus really means, miners are the only ones capable of creating something that resembles a consensus - by the consensual extension of the chain.
How can nodes express agreement with each other? What is the communication that demonstrates this agreement, and what are the persistent artifacts resulting from node consensus? Of course, you cannot answer the question without bringing in mining.
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:43:29
Thanks for explaining, that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:04:00
Bitcoin is just never going to be that useful at its current throughput. So it needs scaling. And to scale well, it needs some protocol changes.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:45:01
What's that got to do with replay protection, which you chose to raise, not me? Also, replay protection will be nigh impossible for bip148 chain with &lt;1% hashpower, as several proposed methods rely on transacting on the chain, which is not likely at a block a day.
Segwit2x is a Segwit soft fork too, so what you are saying also applies. And there is 0% chance of bip 148 getting 51% hashpower, so what's the point in mentioning it? If they were confident in getting the hashpower, why not use an activation threshold? The BIP91 approach is inarguably safer than BIP148.
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:08:07
They use a different signalling method because bit 4 signals not just for the intention to orphan non bit-1 signalling blocks upon activation, but also the intention to hard for to 2x larger blocks, 3 months after Segwit activates.
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:57:30
I think it will eventually scale, and hopefully soon. I was responding to old mate's contention that "being stuck in a dead stalemate", ie no scaling, is a good thing.  
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:21:25
This is true for CNY pairs - the selling pressure it's relieved.
But the opposite is somewhat true for other fiat pairs, since Chinese can now withdraw BTC that were previously unavailable and sell them for USD. Whether this downward pressure outweighs any upwards pressure from improved sentiment remains to be seen, so far it looks like positive sentiment is winning.
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:43:54
You are full of shit.
Where is the relevant code re: this NETWORK flag? I checked [the code]( and it does no such thing. Pruning nodes still relay blocks, they just (obviously) can't provide blocks from within the pruning window to new nodes that are syncing for the first time. The latter has no implications for the ability for any given node to validate.
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:22:37
Well that's kinda everyone's point.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:45:28
It's bi-directional. A chain with only 1/10 of the hash rate will only produce blocks every 100 minutes, will be much more vulnerable to attack, etc. So it is inherently less valuable.
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:23:45
That is certainly a risk, but given that the agreement was entered into in good faith by very many of the important economic players, and there is a lot of community support for larger blocks (just not in this subreddit due to its somewhat special nature), it's certainly not the case that "no one will follow".
There will be a hard fork, and many will follow. Ideally we avoid an ETC/ETH scenario, but if Core won't merge the Segwit2x changes (and I expect them not to - they are at least consistent in their conservatism), then it willl just mean that there will be a new reference implementation, which will compete with core for mindshare / economic relevance.
I expect many exchanges will support both chains, as there's money to be made on both.
That's if miners don't, for example, use Luke-jr's suggestion of a "soft-hardfork" to ensure that the minority chain is unusable and nodes must upgrade. That's another possibility, that could help to avoid the ETH/ETC scenario and help to ensure that the longest chain ends up being the only chain. If that happens, then you can expect a PoW change hardfork to be prepared by eg Luke-jr, and certainly the hat-wearing crowd are likely to run it (though with piddling hashrate that chain is likely to end up being relegated to altcoin status).
 
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:01:30
The only node that matters is your own. It decides what network rules it enforces, and thus what chain it sees. Every litecoin node is essentially a modified bitcoin node running slightly different rules, for instance.
But the chain length does matter too. By changing your nodes rules, or refusing to change your nodes rules, when the majority of mining power continues with different rules, you are choosing to accept lowered security in exchange for adhering to your preferred rules.
This is the choice ETC made vs ETH.
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:14:26
Your point still amounts to saying that UASF only works as an effective ultimatum.
My point was that there are ample loonies in this thread that will tell you that even if miners didn't capitulate, even with &lt; 1% hashpower, come August 1st BIP148 was going to be a roaring success because something something game theory. The justification was always like step 2 in the underpants gnomes business plan.
Glad to hear you are not such a loony.
There is zero chance that Segwit can activate before Aug 1, if you think that's possible you don't understand BIP141. Perhaps you mean BIP91?
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:07:44
On what basis do you believe that? There's only one pool of any import (Slush, the others have GHs lol) that even allows you to mine it, the % had already stabilized at that figure of 0.3%, and now that miners are almost all throwing their weight behind Segwit2x, why would anyone bother to start running it now? You can't even download the binaries from uasf.co anymore.
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:14:46
I can spin up an almost arbitrary number of nodes, so saying that "nodes define consensus" is misleading at best. If I spin up 100,000 nodes that all only accept transactions that include an OP_RETURN output "mrmrpotatohead" have I defined a new consensus?
You clearly need to refine what you mean. And when you do it will probably involve some other hazy concept like "economic nodes". But the gist of that will be: exchanges need to be on board.
I agree with that, but think that time will show that exchanges are going to get on board with Segwit2x.

Also, the exchanges won't be interested in there being reorg risk. If there is a chain split I would expect an incompatible soft fork from the non UASF chain shortly after to prevent any risk of a reorg. 
Bit of a double standard for one soft fork to be better than Jesus's nuts and another, also soft, fork to be worse than Lucifer's butthole.
There's a reason exchanges and others have been clamoring for replay protection since it first looked like a fork was a possibility.
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:38:47
Sure, reorg risk gives asymmetric advantages to the softfork chain.
But if the hashpower is too low, there is zero reorg risk. And even 10% is certainly still too low.
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:42:58
My point was that you won't have to, there will be plenty that see the value in a Bitcoin with twice the block weight. I suspect even a majority.
And the minority chain, without much hashpower, will struggle to survive.
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:20:12
Coherence is not really your forté, neh?
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:40:37




Read my response, I was clear that you are not saying this. Though you have mentioned re-org risk in the past.
Bitcoin with a POW change and Segwit already exists. It's called Litecoin. Perhaps it would be simpler to throw your support behind that?
UASF will fail. And that is a good thing - the precedent that you hope to impose is actually that a vocal minority that is willing to blow themselves up in a game of chicken can impose their will on the protocol.
I want a protocol upgrade too, but this tack is frankly idiotic, and would massively reduce my confidence in Bitcoin were it to succeed.
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:46:24
Neither does the BIP148 client, and they propose to fork with minority hashpower, whereas BIP91 requires 80%.
Which is more responsible?
