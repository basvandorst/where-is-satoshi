Okay then, invest in stocks - the *specific* means (namely, a savings account vs whatever other non-bitcoin means) wasn't the point. I hear Microsoft will be worth a lot more in the future than it is now. The point is, bitcoin is not necessarily better, and it sure as hell isn't the *first* solution to "how do I store my wealth".

Do you expect bitcoin to be different in this regard?

Alternative explanation: spending is *investment*, and incentivising investment/R&amp;D is much better for the economy than encouraging hoarding.

I think the point goes like this: Suppose bitcoin becomes a thing. Someone loses a bitcoin wallet with some bitcoin. 2000 years later, 99.99999% of all bitcoin is lost, but that's okay because the money has just been divided constantly.
Then someone finds that lost bitcoin wallet. Suddenly, they hold more bitcoin than the rest of the world combined.
But that "more than the rest of the world combined" money isn't backed by wealth. You're introducing a proportionally *huge* amount of currency into the economy, which will massively inflate bitcoin and crash the economy.

Isn't putting it into the stock market actually *spending it*? Like, suppose you buy stocks in, say, an apple company. That money goes to either 
1. the apple company as investment, or 
2. someone taking their money out. 
For  the apple company uses that money to expand their business by buying apple-picking machines. That is, they spend your money, which goes through the economy.
For  someone else now has more money to spend. All else being equal, them having more money means them *spending* more money, on average. Or maybe they just buy stocks, which again has a chance of  happening. In fact, I'm pretty sure if this happens *without* a chance of  happening, it's a ponzi scheme.

I don't. Spending money on overpriced tech gadgets provides demand for R&amp;D into higher-priced tech gadgets. It might be an *inefficient* method of funding R&amp;D, but buying an iPhone still does exactly that.
Also, ditto for R&amp;D-&gt;Jobs. Buying an iPhone creates jobs, in a way that buying bitcoin does not.


No, because people "saving" money in USD is fundamentally not the same as saving bitcoin - people "saving" is done in the form of putting their money into banks which generate *interest* - which is to say, what they're actually doing is *loaning* it to banks, and the banks then spend the money they're lent on increasing profits (e.g. through loaning to a business that then spend it on improving efficiency), to generate actual wealth.
In comparison, in a bitcoin-driven economy, "saving" bitcoin is **zero-sum**. For your bitcoin to become more valuable, other people must lose *their* bitcoin.  Encouraging people to invest in zero-sum investments instead of investments that *actually create wealth* is completely absurd.


That's two separate problems. To reiterate, if you put your money in a savings account and it generates wealth, it *is* de-facto deflationary. The difference is that


is *stocks and investments*, rather than actual liquid cash. Deflationary assets is *a solved problem*, bitcoin doesn't do anything useful there.


People need to put more money in their *savings account*, which is, as mentioned above, technically on the "spending" side. The fact that they don't shows that it's some combination of financial literacy and advertising and consumerism, all of which are important, but *completely* outside of the scope of bitcoin. 
Plenty of people don't have a six-month emergency fund, and plenty of people have debts that accrue more debt than their savings accounts accrue interest, and swapping savings accounts that increase in value with *bitcoin* that increases in value won't change that. The solution is to link them to and tell them to get their shit together, not change their currency.

Nonsense. Social obligations and favors were the first currency, in real communities. If people keep track of approximately what everything is worth, then they can just figure out what they owed eachother once a year or so.
The whole "barter" thing is 'history' derived from theory - which is to say, fictitious.
