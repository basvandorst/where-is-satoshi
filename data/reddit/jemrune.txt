I use kraken. Fees arent bad. Easy to sign up
@_date: 2019-07-28 00:52:58
Trading is pretty much instant. Takes a day or two to transfer from my bank to kraken. Takes very little time to transfer bitcoin to and from.

Yes. Learn along the way. You will regret not buying it now.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:52:33
Bought at 8k and it went down to 7k. Bought at 10.5k and it went to 9.5k.  I mean Originally I bought at 20k and it went to 3k so this is better.

Not your keys not your coins. If something goes wrong with coinbase they are not liable if your coins are lost/unrecoverable.

I highly do not recommend this. I used it to buy in 2017 when I was under 18 and all the reliable traders jack up the price and when you transfer the bitcoin off of local bitcoins to a wallet they took a huge fee.

No. I truly believe btc is never going that low again. If it ever goes up significantly in the near future you will regret not buying at 9k.

20k eoy

And you only continue to enforce those ideas with your racist comments.

They're a bunch of liars over there. They ban and censor all the time.

This happened to me, backup your wallet file and uninstall electrum. Redownload the newest version and install and put your wallet file in the folder.

The Satoshi wallet holds 750k BTC last time I checked.

Sorry dude, answering how much money I got in bitcoin is just not something I'm doing on an online survey
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:10:02
Bitcoin would only stabilize after mass adoption where people are actually using it as a currency. If that were to happen bitcoin would have to represent a large amount of value. If we assume even 20 million bitcoins are active (we know it's less, millions have been lost) then you would need a bitcoin price of $50,000 for bitcoin to represent 1 trillion of value. If bitcoin were to represent more than a trillion in value, the price would need to go even greater. 1 trillion isnt a ton when talking about the entire value of wealth on earth.

You do realize the point is to be free of government regulation and fiat, right? Like I understand wanting governments to not ban crypto but we dont want them to regulate them either.

First, you misspelled his name in your original post. That's why people are confused as to what you're talking about. Second, although sure, if he's still alive he could go and sell all his coins, do you really think the inventor of bitcoin would ever want to trade his btc for inferior fiat?

Always hodl. This environment is one of natural selection, only people with strong hands survive.

You can read this entire article but the basis for assuming satoshi has 980k BTC according to this site is that the hashrate remained nearly constant for 1 year and the reward was 50 BTC per block. About 19,600 blocks were mined during that constant hashrate period, meaning that even if they're not at the same wallet or addresses, they are all likely owned by the same person who mined the genesis block.

Hard forks combined with upgrades to the technology can change that. Systems like the lightning network are already being put in place to make transferring bitcoin as fast as a credit card payment today.

If you're serious, know that you dont have to buy a full bitcoin. You can buy a fraction of a bitcoin, just like the dollar is 100 cents, 1 bitcoin is 100,000,000 satoshi

I currently use electrum for my wallet and I used the exchange kraken to buy my bitcoin. Hope this helps.

Yes sorry I'll edit.
