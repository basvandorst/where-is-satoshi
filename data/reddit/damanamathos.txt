That suggests to me the payment is fixed in yen and just paid via Bitcoin, so if Bitcoin goes up they'll just be paid less Bitcoin.
Just like how many places that accept Bitcoin as payment charge in dollars but let you use Bitcoin as the payment mechanism.

You too can create money out of thin air. If you've got a credit card and a bank account, just get a cash advance on your CC and put it in your bank account. You've created money out of thin air!
That's essentially what a bank does. People only think it's "creating money" because they think a deposit account is "money" rather than "what the bank owes me". There's always a balancing item.

The US government (and most economists) want currency to lose value slightly to lead to a slightly inflationary environment. They'd rather people spend their money on goods and services and investment (get the economy going). If currency appreciated each year people would spend less and economic activity would decline as people would just be sitting on their cash hoping it rises in value... a bit like Bitcoin which is used for practically nothing other than financial speculation.

Difference between bitcoin/gold and stocks/businesses/property/bonds is that the latter generate cash flow over time, so in theory you can hold those assets for 100 years and make money without selling them to another buyer.
The aggregate return of stocks/businesses/bonds from birth to death should be the cash flow they generate and is returned to investors. Individual investors then can outperform/underperform this by trading with each other, but I don't think it should change the aggregate return. Bitcoin/gold only has this latter component.

Guess people differ in how narrowly you want to define it.
Many people would call Bernie Madoff's fund a ponzi scheme, for example, but it would fail albacore_futures's definition because investors were never promised a guaranteed high return.
@_date: 2019-07-08 04:02:54
Google has a simpler definition: "a form of fraud in which belief in the success of a non-existent enterprise is fostered by the payment of quick returns to the first investors from money invested by later investors."
Bitcoin isn't strictly speaking a ponzi scheme, but some people use that terminology because it's primarily bought by people as an "investment" seeking high returns, and high returns only come if buyers are willing to pay a higher price to early investors.
Gold is sometimes [described as a ponzi scheme too]( though there's probably less people chasing high returns in gold than in Bitcoin.

Sure, all you need is more motivated sellers than motivated buyers.
People can be motivated to sell by the desire to lock in gains and the worry you'll miss out. If you've gotten in early and you're sitting on $1 million in gains, and BTC suddenly drops 10%, you might begin to think you should sell out and lock in $900k, which is amazing. The more it drops, the more people may be convinced to do the same, leading to a death spiral in the price.
Suddenly the new buyers who recently came on board get scared off buying more, so demand drops, exacerbating that imbalance leading to further price declines.
That's normally how it happens. No idea if that happens or when it happens if it does, but it's certainly a possibility.

The value of bitcoins is the same as the value of fiat money. In both cases you're exchanging something that has nominally no value (certainly no utility value) for things that do have value (coffee, housing, other people's time).
The main difference is most people roughly agree what a dollar is worth (in terms of the goods you can exchange for it) which is why people are willing to be paid in dollars for their time, and why they're willing to sell their goods and services for dollars.
Most people aren't willing to agree to be paid or sell goods in bitcoins (at least not without converting it to a fiat currency first) because there's no stability in what people think it's worth. That's why it's more of a speculative financial asset rather than a functional currency, I would argue.
I wouldn't use the terminology "share" as it implies a lot of things that aren't true. It's more akin to owning a trading card that you hope other collectors will pay more money for later, with some (obvious to this subreddit) positive transactional properties.

Even if you ignore the bubbles, the interest level (of which Google Trends is a reasonable proxy) has declined from June 2014 to now. That doesn't really seem like it's "taking off" to me. It seems like it's a niche payment mechanism that will continue to exist, but isn't gaining widespread adoption.
There was also a huge number of bitcoin and other cryto-currency startups that appeared, but that seems to have slowed.
If you check Indeed Job Trends you'll see "bitcoin" jobs had a huge jump, but seem to have peaked and is now in decline, which isn't what you'd expect if it was taking off. 
What makes you think it's taking off?
Edit/addition: Maybe you can say it was taking off if transaction volumes were picking up - ie. maybe interest is down and bitcoin-related job postings are down, but if people are using it more then it's picking up - but USD transaction volumes looks pretty flat. Transaction numbers are up, but that's due to a decline in the BTC price, and most people still think in terms of USD (not many people use BTC as a functional currency, it's more a transactional currency).

Very few people "in finance" would start an explanation with "in finance"...
But I agree with cardevitoraphicticia on that one. You seem to be hung up on the Google vs Bitcoin analogy, which are different in their risk profiles and the like. Here's a closer analogy -
You go to Vegas with $500, and you're incredibly lucky. While walking out with $50,000 in winnings someone beats you up and steals it from you.
Have you lost $500 or $50,000?

Suppose you had an economy with two people, Bob the Banker and Dan the Debtor. Bob lends $100 to Dan, but with interest Dan owes $106. So in this simple economy you have Dan with $100 cash, and Dan owing $106.
While Dan can't pay off his $106 debt in one go, what he can do is the following steps:
1) Repay $100. Bob has $100, Dan has $0 but owes $6.
2) Do some work for Bob and get paid $6 for the services provided. Bob now has $94, Dan has $6 and owes $6.
3) Repays the $6. Bob now has $100, and Dan is debt free.
In other words, comparing a certain stock of money to a debt figure doesn't mean the debt can never be paid off, as the act of paying it off doesn't destroy the cash -- it merely transfers it from one person to another.

Belief in dollars is reinforced every day.
I get paid in dollars, and I spend in dollars. I'm exchanging the value of my work (which gets paid in dollars) for the things I buy like rent and food (paid in dollars), and dollars are reasonably stable.
The difference with Bitcoin is you don't buy anything in it other than dollars. People buy it as a financial asset they hope will appreciate in value.

I think the moral of the story is it went from $29 to $3 (down 90%), so since recent peak was $19000 you're better off selling now and buying back in at $2000. Thanks!

I was thinking a 5 day week so more like $25k. :)
You could do it if you had someone willing to work and happy to take BTC over 3 months because they think the price will go up, and if the person paying either thought BTC would go down or was willing to hedge it by buying the entire BTC upfront.
In any case, does this lack of use cases make BTC less of a currency and more of a payment mechanism?
Seems the only use cases are (1) transactions fulfilled in another currency (like USD), making BTC more like PayPal or a credit card, or (2) a speculative asset people hold because they think it will go up in price.
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:19:36
I wasn't trying to imply that Bitcoin has no value with the digging a hole example; I was trying to imply that cost and value are different things and not always the same.
Bitcoin does have value, and having an immutable system is valuable, but that value is in how useful it is to people rather than what it costs. If it starts costing $10k worth of real-world resources to process one transaction, I'd argue having the immutable system is no longer worth it for many everyday transactions.
Current energy consumption to process one transaction is 176 kWh according to  which is probably around 14-17c worth of energy consumed.
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:08:37
That's a good measure of cost, but not of value.
If I pay someone to dig a hole, then fill it, and repeat that 1000 times that will surely have a big cost but not much value.
The problem with Bitcoin is assuming that the value is automatically equal to the cost (as expressed by energy to run it). Given how much energy is used to process/verify a transactions, seems like a very expensive transaction to me.
@_date: 2017-09-17 05:52:23
You can do this yourself.
1) Get 10 people to loan you $100 each, and get them to think about it as a deposit. You now have $1000 cash, and owe a total of $1000.
2) With your $1000 cash, lend out some amount ($100, $500, $900) to other people. If you lend out $500, you'll now have $500 on cash, $500 loans owed to other people, and you'll still owe $1000 to the original people.
All of a sudden you don't have the cash on hand to back your deposits.
That's all fractional reserve banking is.

Production is the other side of spending money. Your spending is another person's income. If everybody saved everything, nobody would have an income, and production would decline and arguably quality of life would decline.
You can experience this reality by moving to developing countries and earning a lower income where you can't buy as many things to consume.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:04:59
Which assumptions? I think my assumptions are factually true -- whatever you spend is someone else's income.
Do you, or does anyone you know, work for companies that create non-essential goods &amp; services? If everyone stops buying them, those companies will have no income so will fire everyone and shut down.
If only essential things are bought, their only option is to work on producing essential things.
I suspect you don't mean should stop buying non-essential things. I imagine you just have a view on certain good &amp; services being more worthy of being produced than other things, and don't think people should spend money on things you don't value.
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:18:35


How do you respond to the [high]( [energy]( [consumption]( associated with Bitcoin?
It seems to me like an inefficient system that consumes a lot of real-world resources but those costs are hidden because the people who incur those costs (miners) are paid through issuing new bitcoins (similar to paying employees stock options and then not counting it as an expense).
The other observation is while Bitcoin is a novel technology, most people buying Bitcoin are more interested in it as a speculative asset -- they buy it because they think it will go up in price and hope they'll have another speculator to sell it to, hence all the cheerleading.
Nothing really holds up the price other than belief. It's not backed by anything. Fiat used to be backed by gold (i.e. you could turn it in and get gold back), but isn't anymore. Today fiat is backed by the belief you can exchange your fiat for goods &amp; services from a wide range of people tomorrow. The only thing you can exchange Bitcoin for seems to be fiat.
Having said that, I'm not saying BTC is going up or down. You can make money from speculative assets provided you've got new people coming in willing to spend more.

Network effects.
You do a job or sell a product and you're happy to accept USD because you're confident you can go out tomorrow and exchange that USD for a huge variety of goods and services from other people willing to accept it.
Nobody accepts BTC in its native form. The only people who look like they do only do it because it's instantly converted into USD. BTC is more like a payment mechanism like a Visa credit card than it is a currency.
People say that when more people have it, people will start to natively accept BTC, but that will never happen. You'd see signs of it now if that was the case given the community is large enough.
What the community actually is (for the most part) are speculators who are buying because they want the price to go up and sell to the next buyer to come in.


How many BTC holders no longer use banks? What's the catalyst that would actually make them stop using banks?
At least with the rise of the internet and music streaming you could  point to lower prices, greater availability etc that means it's a compelling service. It's hard to picture that with BTC as for the vast majority of people USD works pretty well.
@_date: 2017-09-26 00:40:02


It's valuable because people think it's valuable. Its price is determined by the willingness of people to buy and sell it like any financial asset.
People who own it and hold it are reducing selling pressure that naturally comes from bitcoin miners who sell to cover their costs. Buying pressure comes from new people buying in (or existing holders buying more) because they think it'll go higher.
All the arguments about the transactional properties about Bitcoin have very little bearing on the price apart from its impact on convincing people to buy into the idea. And the thing about buying into that idea is it makes sense if BTC is $2 or $20 or $20k.
@_date: 2017-09-21 23:53:04
Is it market manipulation when people speak positively on Bitcoin too?
@_date: 2017-09-17 05:59:41
That's a misleading way to look at it as it implies they create $7 for every $1 they have.
A more accurate example would be if someone deposited $100 with them, and they then lent out $88 of that to someone else, leaving them with $12. This simplified example would give the bank:
* $12 cash on hand
* $88 loan asset
* $100 deposits (owed to other people)
Which would give you loans equal to 7.3x the cash on hand. It's not magically created though, it comes from deposits.
Across an economy the loans would be deposited into other banks which could then be lent out.
Money's not magically created. Some people only think that's the case because they consider their bank deposits as money rather than loans to the bank.
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:08:05
That's true, not many is more accurate. Although I don't know of any cases where people natively price things in BTC. I'd be interested to hear of some. :)

A miner spends real money on energy to mine, and they do it because they're rewarded by (transaction cost + miner reward), which has to exceed their cost to be worthwhile.
If miner rewards go to zero over time, doesn't that mean transaction costs need to go up to compensate? Otherwise it won't be worthwhile mining anymore.

The key thing it lacks is stable pricing. If I'm selling my services for Bitcoin, I want to be relatively sure I can spend those Bitcoin in a week or two and get a similar level of value. That doesn't happen when it wildly fluctuates up and down, which is why nobody natively prices anything in Bitcoin.

I think what he's trying to say is in countries with a volatile currency, Bitcoin makes sense as a store of value as their currency is fragile.
In a country like the US, using Bitcoin has no purpose other than speculation -- he means that for the vast majority of people other payment methods (cash, credit card, PayPal, online bank transfer, etc) are far more convenient, which is true (and why Bitcoin doesn't have mass adoption for transferring money).
By speculation he means most people buying it are doing it because they think the price will go up, which is also true. Nobody buying Bitcoin is doing it because they want to use it as a functional currency (i.e. nobody's writing contracts to be paid or to pay someone in fixed BTC amounts as far as I know).

That's true, though it's straightforward to extend the example.
If nobody bought non-necessities, then anybody that has income from creating non-necessities (like an awesome meal) would lose that income and either starve or go back to producing necessities for himself which would reduce overall economic production and make everyone poorer.

Okay, but that's a very different definition of "backed by" that's used when people once described fiat as being "backed by" fiat. With that expanded definition you can say fiat is backed by its intrinsic useful properties too.


I don't know if anyone believes the financial system uses zero Watts -- sounds like a straw man argument.
Modern financial institutions include costs within their cost structure. Visa incurs costs for running its network, but it charges fees that cover those running costs (which is why it's profitable). Same with payment gateways, banks, etc.
In the case of Bitcoin the true costs aren't charged to the end user but instead covered by creating new Bitcoins that are allocated to miners who can then sell them to new people speculating on BTC.


I'm not sure why you're so defensive. I don't think there's any immediate catalysts to crash Bitcoin so long as new people come into it. The appeal for new speculators is the arguments that supposedly back it (the intrinsic qualities you speak of) work at any price and at any energy cost which means it can keep spiraling up until you run out of new people to come in.

Have you ever looked at a bank balance sheet?
Banks need to keep reserves against deposits. For large banks (with more than $115.1m in deposits) they need to reserve 10%, which means if they have $1000 in deposits they'd need to keep $100 cash and could lend out $900. See [here](
You can't start with $1000 cash and lend out $5000 unless that $5000 was kept in your bank (and added to your deposit base), and only then if you met the reserve requirements.
Take a look at Wells Fargo's balance sheet. You can find it [here](
What's you'll notice is $1.3 trillion in deposits (a liability for the bank) and $946 billion in loans (an asset for the bank). They're not taking $1.3 trillion in deposits and making $5 billion in loans like you suggest.
I'd suggest watching this [Khan Academy video]( for an intro on how fractional reserves banking works
If you've never looked at a bank balance sheet, he has two videos that explain how the bank balance sheet works.
[Part one]( goes through the example of where deposits are loaned out to other banks.
[Part two]( goes through the example of creating loans out out of scratch (offset by deposit accounts at the bank) which is functionally equivalent to part one and limited by the reserve requirements.
