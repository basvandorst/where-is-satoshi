Monero is becoming more popular though and as soon as there will be hardware wallet support and multisig support which shouldn't take too long anymore most DNM's will probably add Monero or move to Monero. And from there on I expect most people to just start using Monero on DNM's.

No news about a hack.
Probably because fees are going crazy and exchanges are having a lot of downtime lately (due to a lot of orders and transactions)

If everyone were to do it it would work.
Basic economy: supply/demand.
But most people are too emotional about it and sell/buy the dips/peaks.

And that's how dips happen. I'm afraid to lose my money ... sells. Price temporarily crashes and then goes back up (at least until now it always has the past doesn't always predict the future). But it most likely will go back up again and you'll have lost money by selling in the dip. But don't take my advice do whatever you want it's your money and I wouldn't trust a random stranger on Reddit giving me trading advice myself.
edit: as far as I can see there's already some resistance at the current price so I doubt that it will crash much further. Current price at time of this edit: 13 636.6 XBT/USD on Kraken

I hope some companies are going to open "Bitcoin banks" for people like this. Of course this doesn't stop true Bitcoin lovers from keeping their coins in their own wallet. But some people (like this guy) are safer using a wallet controlled by someone else because they don't know how it works and don't want to investigate to find out.
