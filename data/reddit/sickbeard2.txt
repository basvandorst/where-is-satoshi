Yeah, if I did my math right, a 16 digit pw with upper &amp; lower case, numeric &amp; symbols has 4.45 x 10^31 possibilities.
Assuming one hundred billion (100,000,000,000) guesses per second, you will exhaust your options in only 14.1 trillion (14,100,000,000,000) years.
Child's play.

AFAIK, you can't currently attempt 100,000,000,000 pws a second to get a bitcoin purse. So my scenario isn't currently feasible.  Even if you increase my brute force example up to 100 quadrillion per second, you're still talking about a 16 digit pw being secure for millions of years via brute force.


You are speaking about an unknown future. For all we know, AES will get cracked tomorrow. In that case, it doesn't matter if your pw is 16 digits, or 64.


That's not what I was suggesting at all, and you messed up the quote. Your version of the quote doesn't sound ridiculous because at the time, 640k was enough for anyone. 
But I digress. Bottom line is the OP is clearly on top of things, if 16 digit passwords become insecure, I'm sure he'll be changing his security settings appropriately.
