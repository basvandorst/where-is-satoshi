The funny thing is that everything in America is a bubble. Tuition fees, housing, stock market, etc. The "Bitcoin is a bubble" is a distraction from the bigger economic issues around us. If anything, bitcoin is the safer fail and has no great impact on the world economy. Imagine if/when the American student debt bubble pops? Economic Disaster.

I don't see him as a legend. He just got lucky finding an exploit and used it. He saw how investors were looking at just the fundamental data and he saw something different on the ground. His theory gave him capital, and now he's a "whale" he plays a different trading game. Don't be fooled EVERY trader wants to reach this level. This is where you can dictate/manipulate the market and do some interesting stuff that can change countries. 
Traders end up becoming powerful &amp; influential people because we know what tools to exploit the system since we see it in the market buying &amp; selling.

Soros uses Reflexivity theory in markets though. He exploits markets that he believes will tank. A lot of his research is social studies and analyzing the market in the streets. I think he sees how many entrepreneurs, coders, engineers, creatives, etc. are flocking to develop blockchain/cryto infrastructure. At least that is what I see on the street level.

Come on man, trading is all a gamble. Soros took a huge bet on shorting the pound because he saw an exploit. He was even right about the Asian tigers dominating the global economy in 2009 and look where we are today. The best traders take advantage of exploits.
I think he has crazy obsession with being known as a great philosopher like Freud, but that will never happen...lol. I believe Soros is getting into cryptos because it aligns with his world vision of merging international capitalism with state capitalism.
