You need to read the statutory definition of money transmission of your state. It could vary state by state.

You can turn a blind eye to his predicament all you want. Whatever helps you sleep at night. Truth and facts and people start to find anything to salvage what he did wrong was acceptable. He is stil innocent until proven guilty. I don't rush to conclusions.

Any customer could of came to him stating he was investing in Bitcoins and done the deal. That person could have gone on and bought drugs, buy stolen cc's and whatnot but the amount of the money transactions he was doing per year was in noncompliance with the money transmission statute. Bitcoin is becoming more widely adopted and is coming up against financial laws people are unaware about as a MSB. 
If users on here would pool their knowledge base and guide users based on state laws, we could avoid these do's
s and don'ts. But that requires lawyers, accountants, people familiar with money reporting and so forth to compile an emerging digital currency in its infancy in the financial banking sphere. Not spewing this and that about he traded x BTC for x cash. They arrested him for using bitcoins. The nerve of those police jackals. 
The second charge was due to him going ahead knowing the agent was using it for an illegal activity and the money laundering threshold of 10k reporting.
FL Chpt 896
(a) Knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, to conduct or attempt to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity:

People seem to be ignoring that part that the agent was buying the to purchase stolen cc's. That statement should have rung a bell in his head that something is up.

Yeah, let's ignore that fact the agent told him he would be using the bitcoins for buying stolen credit card numbers. Common sense goes a long way. The prosecutor is just going to turn a blind eye to that. Knowledge (also intnent) is a big element in statutory criminal laws.
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:16:33
That is what everyone should be looking at rather than standing up for this Charlie Shrem. It seems bank executives can wreak havoc on the economy, money launder but still can't end up in jail for some reason. It seems they only go to jail when they commit crimes against either wealthy people or banks themselves.

They have guidelines but no immunity. Banks probably will not take up dispensary money. They still could be prosecuted for prividing services for a drug still listed as on Schedule 1.  No immunity from prosecution no deal.

A untrue statement cannot be admitted into court and not corrected. Its perversion of the court system. You do not want to piss off a judge.

No he does not. He thinks some people are incompetent to think for themselves. Repeating old and tiring GOP phrases isn't thinking and doing your own homework on divisive issues.

If his methodology into valuing a company doesn't make sense to him why would he go against if it has worked for him so long?
Obviously we don't have his investing report on these companies to see why but he has his reasons based on immense research and analysis to reach his conclusion.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:38:03
I don't know why your getting down voted. Valid point. 
Do commercial businesses like TigerDirect need to know words like hash and node to accept BTC? No.

If Bofa did a report on BTC you wouldn't think Berkshire put to work some lackey in the office to research it and see if there is opportunity to invest in startups across the country and the world?
Stop being so fickle over a negative statement about BTC. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:22:30
Some users on here only care about BTC prices. Every time someone says something bad or against BTC they throw up posts like mad scientists. Provide meaningful discussion on further BTC infrastructure, widespread adoption and getting consumers more info into securing and using BTC every day. BTC is still young and will go through its criticisms, scandals, etc but don't get ham up on every critique or negative evaluation from someone reporter or some famous person. 
To me the negative and positive about BTC from others should be a starting point to either clarify or fulfill a need for the BTC community.

If you are moving large sums of money...maybe a lawyer should be involved. At the least a brief consultation. 
I think I better post an article on money transmission laws in all 50 states since localbitcoins is currently doing it behind the scenes quietly. I have access to Westlaw. Should be a fund research project on top of my classes. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:16:03
You really think he did not do research on Apple &amp; Google?
He doesn't understand them is a simple statement not something the public would be privy to in a financial/technical sense of the "why" (behind the scenes reports that are proprietary) Berkshire isn't investing in them. When I read b/c he doesn't understand Apple &amp; Google, it seems to be it goes against what investment method he uses to evaluate companies for future value and growth. In the end all he is looking for is ROI for an investment he can see/know and understand why it will attain a certain ROI percentage in the next decade and so forth. 
I'm sure if he gave the longer financial analysis version of "why he doesn't understand them" people would be saying a different tune or even agree with it. I certainly can't afford Apple and Google shares let alone Berkshire Hathaway shares. 
I'm not saying these two companies are bad investments in my opinion. They obviously will invest/innovate/purchase/sell off to grow to satisfy/appease hungry shareholders when they start to stagnate.

Auctions really don't make sense in my opinion. I have been scouring auctions sites for used cars to purchase my first car. Sometimes the price doesn't make sense to me involving the hassle of paying a mechanic to look at a car when the final price is out of your budget. I feel this auction for this block isn't going to go cheap. I am betting it goes above whatever the market value is at time of auction.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:34:37
This. Someone like WB who invests in undervalued companies and makes returns every year for his shareholders doesn't "know" about BTC. Yeah, he doesn't have analysts to do research reports on companies and financial instruments. He justs twiddles his thumbs at his desk and randomly picks companies and stocks to invest in.
Seriously some people on here really get foolish when a negative statement comes out about BTC.

You really need to read the criminal complaint. Dude knowingly (keyword here for intent for any criminal statutes where knowledge is the element of the crime, 1L Crim Law) disregarded AML laws, knew who Robert was on SR, purchased drugs from SR personally and ignored his duties as compliance officer of a company. The email evidence is pretty damning.

I'm surprised no one has mentioned the exact store name.

He did more than 20K in transactions in a year before they made a dummy setup. Read the bloody statute. I want to see the criminal complaint itself about how it all went down. Assumptions are bad.

Credit union is still a financial banking institution. 
The money and wading through of financial regulations will probably discourage a lot of people. Maybe a online bank could be easier like INGDirect now CapitalOne360 but still have to make sure you are in compliance with AML, and other laws.

The ludicrous analogies people have been using here to explain these defendants position in using Bitcoins doesn't absolve of the alleged crimes they are charged with in each case.
This sub seems to ignore all these little know facts about compliance with AML and MSB requirements as a burden. Currency in whatever form digital or hard the gov't wants to know how each and every individual received their income. Money laundering is just a way to hide your source of income. The gov't has outlawed anonymous sources of income. They create rules and regulations to thwart criminal and illegal elements. They prosecute you when you break those rules. 
No one can just money launder cars, diamonds, real estate without some business entity which is required to take your identifying information and financial transactions to either the IRS or whatever agency. One day you have a beater in your garage, the next you have half a million platoon of 3-4 super cars. I'm sure your nosy neighbors would like to know how you came into/what do you do for a living/? Oh, you work at as county clerk that pays 60K a year. You have two lambos and maserati. Interesting. 
Business entities like banks, Western Union, Paypal are like subsidiaries of the gov't who report money limits to them when individuals hit there reporting transaction requirements. They sure in hell ain't going to ignore them like what Charlie Shrem did. They love making money not inviting criminal liability.

I can't let you lead people to jail time.

isleepinahammock, don't waste your time comrade. Some individuals in this sub seem to blatantly ignore the laws of individual states people reside in that but up against money transmission laws. Ignore facts like an undercover agent stating he is going to purchase stolen cc's with bitcoins. They live in a fantasy zone and just want to see $10,000 USD = 1 BTC value. That is all they see. They ignore facts and reason and spew really bad analogies. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 04:04:30
Probably some management firm either looking to get into Bitcoin now or a firm already searching for a large block of coins off an exchange like this auction. Someone is going to be happy. I doubt they would go for cheap. Auctions pump prices like nothing.

He operated an exchange service that dealt with fiat. He was the CEO of a money transmitter company dealing with consumers buying bitcoins. A money transmitter must register with the U.S. Treasury to operate. It is a felony to operate without a license. Coinbase, BitPay, Paypal, etc are money transmitters. These entities usually must follow AML restrictions for those looking to transmit fiat for illicit purposes. 
Paypal restricts users to 500. That is the default for everyone unless you upgrade to a business account I believe. Paypal is Paypal. They can institute any monetary policies they feel keeps them out of court/trouble and sit back and eat fees. You will only be reported to the IRS if you make large transactions over 10K by financial and money transmission businesses.

You cannot subjectively value something and 'claim' its worth this. Good point.
It must be the fair market value of the item. An objective standard.
§61 requires an objective measure of fair market value.
Ex. Rooney v. Commissioner (88) (T/p’s must value their compensation by applying an objective measure of fair market value. Partners in accounting firm discounted services paid to firm for debt owed. Partners discounted these services subjectively w/o telling clients anything.)
