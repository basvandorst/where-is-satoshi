6 doge = 6 doge, it never goes down!

If someone accidentally sent me 500k, I would keep it and feel only slightly bad the rest of my life.  I wouldn't feel bad for very long though, because I would be on a jet ski.

Because that's monumentally different than having an idea?

Post from HonestAnt yesterday:


Why the fuck are you even here?
@_date: 2014-06-02 16:33:58
Shit happens to everyone man, I know you've screwed up in your life a few times.  There's a chance you would have lost 500k by now if there was a chance you'd ever get your hands on that much money at one time, your mistakes have just probably been cheaper than his.  Either way you seem a bit miserable to be around.

Yeah, its way better than losing $850,000, get over it. $850,000 is nearly $1,000,000 dollars.

How does locking money allow you to revoke payments off-chain?

Hahah, okay dude, sure.  The whole "You can't believe any news that says negative things about Trump" is definitely not a liberal thing.
@_date: 2016-12-10 16:41:07
MSM/Fake News is definitely an alt-right staple... I don't know why you'd try and deny it, hahah.  Meme on bro, don't let me ruin your day.

How exactly does this help me understand the perspective of a bunch of bigoted white children that incorrectly believe they're being oppressed by minorities existing and people noticing they're racist?  Hot Star Wars meme by the way, you must have tons of internet friends with that kind of wit.

I was gonna write you an actual response making fun of you trying so hard to sound smart, but I think I'll just leave it at "Lol."
@_date: 2015-07-26 14:29:27
You are correct I believe, it is that little chip in some cards you can use without swiping.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:57:40
That was so damn relevant

I doubt anyone's being extradited to America over fax bombing... although the media might be able to run with that name until we have an incident.

I put on my robe and wizard hat.

Yeah, if someone had 500 dollars of mine and didn't care about it, I'd be pissed enough to post too.


That would make me seriously reconsider using their website and is good information for the community.




If it's not profitable, 500 dollars seems like a nice chunk of money to snag out of thin air.


If you're going to program something that handles people's money, you better be damn sure it's perfect or that you are at least able to resolve problems with it.

45,000 subscribers?  Why, that's almost 50,000 subscribers[!](

OH SNAP OP YOU JUST GOT SERVED!

Responding to separate people's questions individually instead of redirecting them to a comment you posted earlier doesn't reflect badly on your project, it makes you look like you care about the concerns people have and shows good customer support.
Maybe if you don't want to read about this project you shouldn't in a thread about it.

Other than calling yourself graceful, that was strangely eloquent - I enjoyed the tactic.

Upvoted to progress the progress of progressiveness.

You guys are watching too many movies.  These are people with lives, there's no real justification for throwing around hitmen.

Little green ghouls?
@_date: 2013-08-05 19:47:29
Okay, you've won me over with this reference.  I respectfully withdraw the snarkiness of my original comment.
@_date: 2013-09-18 17:49:57
Superb!
