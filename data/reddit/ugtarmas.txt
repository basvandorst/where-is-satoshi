Set smaller buy orders throughout the course of a month on all major bitcoin exchanges. I am sure you can fill a large chunk of that and not push the price up too high.

You shouldn't be outraged about the price being $65 higher on localbitcoins, but rather, pleasantly surprised that the price $65 dollar lower on exchanges.
To trade dollars for bitcoins on those exchanges, you actually to pay for numerous privacy violations, various risks associated with transferring money oversees, the risk that the exchange will shut down before you get to use it, the float period between sending the money and it being credited to your account, etc, etc.
Since you decided to take on all those risks, naturally the bitcoin price is lower. Hell, you paid for it, didn't you?

I find it suspicious that this bill outlines June 15th 2015 as the start date. It coincides with Ben Lawsky's departure from his position as Superintendent of Financial Services in that same general time period. This might mean he is anticipating to complete his work with BitLicense before his departure.
I doubt he is going into retirement, which means he might be going to work for a private institution such as a bank.
A worst case scenario might be that BitLicense gets passed with draconian regulations, and then a moratorium will prevent future changes for 5 years.
If anyone wants to do research on this, I am sure this community would like to see it.

Not even tackling your antiquated use of "third world" (did the berlin wall fall yesterday?), credit cards are not a stepping stone between fiat and Bitcoin. Therefore, it is disingenuous to say Bitcoin adoption in *developing nations* will be difficult because Visa/Mastercard could not monetize it successfully.
Simply put, the fact that developing nations only had 5% land line rollout did not stop 99% usage of cellphones.

onename.io forces you to tie your real identity to your wallet address, and it requires username/pass-phrase registration.
wantsbtc.com lets you chose any username or alias, has nothing to do with your personal identity, and does not require you to "log in" to use it.

The world wide web wasn't really designed for this type of usage as far as I can tell.
I mean, maybe we'll figure it out and come to a consensus that's going to enable scaling, but that's turning out to be easier said than done. And it seems there's a lot of assumption by industry backed by many millions of dollars that solving this problem is inevitable. Maybe it is, but there's also a lot of people who don't share in the vision that the Internet is meant to handle massive amounts of data and/or bandwidth.
In all seriousness, maybe Mosaic and other interested parties should set aside some money to fund some research in to solving this issue. It seems the future of their business(and others) depend on the world wide web evolving beyond what it is today.

Time for some common sense.
The person that owns this wallet (  ) owns approximately 152,000 bitcoins. If bitcoin is worth 50 million per coin, this ONE person will own the equivalent of 7,600,000,000,000 or 7.6 trillion dollars. 2013 USA gdp is 16.8 trillion dollars. (
Does that make any sense at all? That does not sound like an adequate distribution? Isn't bitcoin supposed to help regarding wealth distibution? One person owning about 50% of USA's GDP? 
Lets say one bitcoin is worth 50 million dollars. At this point whether there are 11-21 million bitcoins in circulation is completely irrelevant, because we are talking about orders of magnitude. 10 million * 50 million = 500 trillion dollars, which is 31x USA GDP.

Argument to moderation (Latin: argumentum ad temperantiam)—also known as [argument from] middle ground, false compromise, gray fallacy, and the golden mean fallacy[1]—is an informal fallacy which asserts that the truth must be found as a compromise between two opposite positions. This fallacy's opposite is the false dilemma.
Vladimir Bukovsky points out that the middle ground between the Big Lie of Soviet propaganda and the truth is itself a lie, and one should not be looking for a middle ground between disinformation and information.[2] According to him, people from the Western pluralistic civilization are more prone to this fallacy because they are used to resolving problems by making compromises and accepting alternative interpretations, unlike Russians who are looking for the absolute truth.
An individual operating within the false compromise fallacy believes that the positions being considered represent extremes of a continuum of opinions, and that such extremes are always wrong, and the middle ground is always correct.[1] This is not always the case. Sometimes only X or Y is acceptable, with no middle ground possible. Additionally, the middle ground fallacy can create the rather illogical situation that the middle ground reached in the previous compromise now becomes the new extreme in the continuum of opinions; all one must do is present yet another, radically opposed position, and the middle-ground compromise will be forced closer to that position. In politics, this is part of the basis behind Overton window theory.
An example of the argument to moderation would be to regard two opposed arguments—one person saying that slavery is always wrong, while another believes it to be legitimate—and conclude that the truth must therefore lie somewhere in between.[3]

If Bitcoin relies on morality to dictate its usage, it has failed. It is neither disgusting, nor commendable. It simply is. 
The solution to this problem (if you can even call it a problem) is within the protocol, not blaming miners for acting in their best interests (whatever they may be).

Because when you put money on those exchanges, you are trading Bitcoin for Huobi IOUs, OKCoin IOUs, etc etc. The amount they would make with 1% trading fees pales in comparison to the amount of money they make doing fractional reserve.

CC fees are 2.9% at their worst. At 5% they are undoutebly giving their customers a better deal, but I think their explanation is a red herring. 
They are looking for the 40% discount that comes with committing tax fraud and not reporting cash income.

Think about this from a personal perspective. Would you decide to use Bitcoin again while your transaction is not being confirmed?
**In normal cases, people use Bitcoin many times per day**. But, if they have an unconfirmed transaction worrying them, **they won't use Bitcoin again until it confirms**.
Unconfirmed transactions cause users to have **Fear**, **Uncertainty**, and **Doubt**. 
Please **stop celebrating** the fact that people **leave Bitcoin** due to its **present broken state**.

I don't think shopify allows you to set BTC as your base currency, even though they accept integration with BTC payment processors.
As a workaround, you can use USD, and then use the API to dynamically change prices based on BTC/USD pair, and then hack up the theme to divide the USD price by the bitcoin price, but that sounds like a lot of work.
