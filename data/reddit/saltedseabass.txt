"I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world - no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men."

"The prosecution admitted in court that the purported victims of the Silk Road killings were never found, and that Canadian police couldn't even locate records for anyone with their names."
"Here’s another fact: upon his arrest in October of 2013, six allegations of murder-for-hire were used to sensationalize the story. Fact: they were used as justification to deny him bail. And yet, when this current trial, with seven charges was brought, all allegations of murder-for-hire were mysteriously dropped. These six biggest crimes, the most abhorrent crimes, that he was publicly accused of: they were dropped."
"Why wouldn’t the government bring forth the charges for the most terrible crimes of which he was accused? Because they had nothing to support them. This is a frequent tactic of government, used in many court situations to bolster a case that doesn’t have a strong enough one within the bounds of legal proceedings.
The often-referenced transcripts of Ulbricht allegedly ordering five murders have not been addressed by actual charges, and no evidence has been provided that the individual in those transcripts is in fact Ulbricht.
So no, Ross Ulbricht was not charged with, convicted of, or sentenced for murders-for-hire. He was charged, convicted and sentenced on the seven counts listed at the beginning of this article, and not one, nor all combined, justify a life in prison.
Speaking of his conviction, an appeal is necessary. Rampant corruption was revealed after his conviction: two federal agents were under investigation (before and during the trial) and have now been indicted for corruption: stealing and extorting funds from Silk Road, as well as other crimes. One of the agents (DEA agent Carl Mark Force) was the lead undercover agent in the case against Ulbricht, and had high-level access to administrative functions of the Silk Road, including the ability to manipulate logs, chats, private messages, posts, account information and bank accounts. The details can be found at this article and this page."

I'm not denying that central banks can influence politicians to pass legislation, but no central bank of a major country can directly erect new laws or without relying on other institutions.

50% of BTC's value increase from 2010-2019? Not even remotely likely.
Edit: The price went from $0.10 to $10.000 in 2010-2019, a 100.000 fold increase. Half of that return would mean Bitcoin's price would be at $500.000.000? Are you actually serious?

Your government/central bank only needs to justify itself when the CPI strays too far from the 2% mark, not when actual inflation falls out of that range. Therein lies a big part of the problem. 
My government isn't the problem, I would not trust any person in the entire world to be able to manipulate the supply of my chosen currency with no transparency. A currency that is dependent on trust is inherently inferior to a trustless currency.

If you truly believe what you've written in the first paragraph then you're extremely gullible. When you give a certain individual or group the power to create wealth out of thin air for themselves and those they seek favors from by weakening the purchasing power of everyone else who is holding money you can be sure that they will abuse it. Just ask yourself why the Consumer Price Index was created and why it's being used to measure inflation while property, land and investment prices are being ignored completely. When you realise the benefit this gives to the people controlling the money supply the rest will make sense too.
It seems like you misunderstand how Bitcoin's supply model works. Bitcoin does have inflation. The current inflation rate is a little under 4% and gets halved every 4 years. The difference between Bitcoin and traditional fiat currencies is that Bitcoin's supply is fully transparent.

CPI is used because a controlled selection of a few dozen goods is easy to manipulate through subsidies and price ceilings thereby enabling central banks to understate inflation. 
People in this sub (or any Bitcoin related community) are mistrustful because Bitcoin doesn't need trust to work and introducing trust into the system would mean creating an attack vector for others to target Bitcoin. If you really believe this attitude is bad for Bitcoin then you not only disagree with the community here, but with the concept behind Bitcoin itself. It sounds more like you want a state or central bank controlled digital currency with a private, non-transparant ledger. Something like the Petro Dollar, but from a more stable government.

This is another obvious deep state lie. Look at what they accused Ross Ulbricht of. Look at Trump-Russia collusion accusations. WMDs in Iraq etc.
It's always the same strategy, make grave accusations against chosen target using non-identifiable (read: non-existent) sources as "proof", have mainstream media propagate these claims with no fact checking, accuse people who demand evidence of being immoral, unpatriotic, conspiracy theorists etc., succesfully achieve character assassination of target, quietly offer fake apology years after the incident once the damage has become irreversible.

Actually, there are 8 bits contained in every byte so the rate would be 7 kilobytes/second for a 56k modem. That would mean the transmission would take about 4571 seconds or   ~ 1h, 10m. Still too long to be practical though.

Maybe you're the exception then, but take a look around in this to get an idea of what I'm talking about. Bitcoin is uncensorable money outside of the control of states and corporations and yet the vast majority of leftists in this thread are cheering the fact that a social media platform that protects free speech far better than the competition, although not entirely, is being deplatformed in a co-ordinated fashion because these people can't accept that a platform exists in which conservative ideas can be exchanged without having to fear being banned from the service like on Twitter, Facebook, Youtube etc. If you don't see how this directly contradicts everything that Bitcoin stands for then I don't know what to tell you.

The problem is that free speech includes "toxic" and hurtful speech as well as any other types of speech. So they are in fact villifying free speech when they are cheering certain voices being silenced.
You can discourage certain types of speech by choosing not to engage with or criticizing it, but that's not what's happening here.
Civility can be a useful tool when it originates from the individual as it can encourage constructive dialogue. However, civility enforced from top to bottom is very harmful as it removes the choice from the individual and forces them to conform. In this instance, civility loses all of its meaning because it no longer exist to provide fertile grounds for discussion, but is used to shield oneself from punishment. In addition, there is no such thing as a perfect arboter who decides what is civil and what isn't. If you look at the major social media platforms you will find that they selectively enforce this ideal. Whereas  criticism from conservatives is often immediately censored, calls to violence and even death threats made by accounts from the Left are usually dismissed as not violating the ToS, even though they clearly do, and it is only after widespread reports in the media that these platforms take action in these instances. Bear in mind that it would still be injust if the tables were turned here, either the policies should apply to all users equally or they shouldn't be applied at all.

Just a couple of examples of incidents were Twitter initially ruled that death threats against conservatives did not violate their ToS and only backpaddled several weeks after continued media coverage. The last example is a stream of new tweets calling for the murder of Trump which Twitter is also fine with.
As to your other point, I feel like we are talking in circles. I'm lamenting the fact that Bitcoiners, for lack of a better term, who believe that money transfers shouldn't be censorable are cheering the censorship of speech. Yes they have no right to use someone's social media platform and demand that their free speech is upheld by a private company, but even if they go on to create their own platform, that platform then immediately gets targeted by payment providers who will prevent them from receiving any revenue. The solution is obviously to adopt an uncensorable payment protocol such as Bitcoin which would circumvent the payment providers, but the tech is still too cumbersome to use and set up for the average social media user to be a valid alternative at this point in time.

The chairman of the Federal Reserve isn't elected, he is appointed by the President. You can't vote on the chairman even if you are a citizen in good standing.
I think you are confused about what a central authority is. If a Bitcoin developer or anyone else wants to change the Bitcoin protocol and he needs consensus to do so, he isn't relying on a central authority. A central authority, like the Fesd, doesn't need consensus or approval to implement changes, they simply dictate the changes they want to implement. 
This is one of the important differences between Bitcoin and central banks.

UBI means taking away peoples' income and redistributing it to people who don't have an income. The more people earn, the more income is taken away from them. It's a system that punishes people who take risks and create value and rewards those who don't provide anything. Essentially, it's the policy equivalent of parasitism.
In addition to the moral aspect there are also economic concerns like deepening the $20+ trillion debt deficit and inflation through money printing that would be required to fund UBI.

A central authority is defined as:
"an individual who or entity that is performing a Central Authority function, having been authorized to do so by the designated Central Authority, in accordance with the Convention and the law of the Central Authority's country.”
While this obviously applies to central banks the same cannot be said for Bitcoin. Node operator's ability to vote on changes to the network isn't reliant on or adherent to the laws of any individual or groups of countries.

Deflationary assets discourage spending on items that aren't necessities. People will still buy food, water, electricity, housing etc. because they require them.
Spending on unnecessary items like luxury goods, fast food, gadgets etc. will go down when people aren't punished for saving.
If Bitcoin becomes a global currency it will restructure economies to the point where far fewer resources are spent on useless shit, saving will become a widely adopted strategy again and we won't read op-eds from people in their 30s complaining how they will never own a house in their lives that they write on their $1000+ iPhones  that get replaced every year while drinking their $5 coffees.

Taxation happens everywhere that government exist. Abolish government and you abolish taxes. 
Neither UBI nor any other gov program can fix the inherent immorality of taxation, they only increase the amount of taxation required.
There is nothing wrong with people making more money than other people. If you take risks, market yourself well or create value than you should earn more money than people who don't. UBI stands in contrast to this because you receive money for doing nothing, paid for by people who do work, take risks and create value. It incentivizes people to do nothing and leech off of other peoples' success.

The price won't become stable until mass adoption occurs at which point BTC's price will be nowhere near current levels.
Some guy buying novelty items with Bitcoin doesn't negatively affect Bitcoin in any way and it won't stop happening. People buy stupid shit with all currencies.

Your argument relies on the fact that stocks aren't easy to use as currency. 
People are hesitant to sell their BSH shares because they first need to go through an exchange, sell a certain amount of shares that will leave you with a lot of unneeded USD for the transaction you want to complete, wait for the bank transfer to finish, log into your bank account app or type in your credit card details etc. and only then are you able to pay.
With Bitcoin you open your wallet, scan a QR code and hit send. Done.
Saying that people won't spend Bitcoin because it  will appreciate in value would also mean that people would never spend their USD on anything other than Bitcoin (or BSH shares) which obviously isn't true. People need to eat, pay for rent and utilities, necessities, entertainment etc.

It does make it easier, but Coinbase only lets you send IOUs from one person to another, they do not give you control over your keys. Might as well use PayPal then. Wallets like Electrum, Breadwallet, Mycelium, Samourai etc. already offer a pretty streamlined experience and they get improved over time. But I understand your point, unless your average grandmother can't use Bitcoin it isn't ready for mass adoption. You're right, but we'll get there in time.

I'm really glad that I could change your view. The issue of gun (il)legality is very important to me and to the country as a whole in my opinion so I'm trying to show people that there are times when guns can be used for good (self-defense as well as protecting the lives of others) and they're not just used for murder like the common narrative that's advanced by many mainstream media outlets. Kudos to you for keeping such an open mind and evolving your opinion when you encounter new information!
@_date: 2019-09-09 14:52:57
So what? It invalidates your entire argument. Despite guns being illegal, criminals are still able to obtain them. The only people who aren't able to obtain guns when they're made illegal are law-abiding citizens who would use them for self-defense and protecting their friends and family.
As to your other argument, compliance doesn't guarantee your safety. Some criminals will harm or even kill you despite you following their orders completely. Why would you gamble with your own life like that when you have no idea what's going on inside the attacker's head? 
Please take a look at these videos of people being  killed despite them fully complying with the criminals' demands and then tell me how being unarmed and defenseless kept the deceased victims safe:

So when you find an example that supports your thesis you view it as proof that your beliefs are correct, but when you are given several examples that directly contradict your thesis you shrug it off, saying "you can find examples for anything"?
One video was of a guy walking down a street and getting knifed to death for no reason whatsoever, he was clearly unarmed and complied with the robber. Another one showed an attacker jumping behind the counter of a pharmaceutical store, i.e. he knew there were no weapons behind the counter, and stabbing the employee dozens of times.
If you want examples of armed European robberies, here's a few:
London is known as the world's knife attack capital of the world, there are far more homicides per capita involving knives than ones where a gun was used to commit the crime. If the victims in all these cases were armed with guns, at least some of them would still be alive today. 
But not in Europe, where the state wants law-abiding citizens to remain unarmed and defenseless while criminals who have no reason to follow the law will always be at an overwhelming advantage over their victims thanks to anti-gun laws.
What gets me isn't even that the state is doing this since it's pretty obvious why the state would prefer an unarmed populace over an armed one, but that there are people who actually buy into the state's justification for it, that this helps keep the populace safe (cause concerns like that clearly what keep politicians awake at night), while not even considering the real reason that an unarmed populace is much easier to control and far less likely to rise up against their rulers.
Have you never wondered why every single dictator who has ever ruled implemented the same anti-gun laws as your European rulers? Or do you also believe that their goal was to keep their citizens safe?

@_date: 2019-09-11 03:08:59
Here's where your mistaken: 
Your argument was "But if I see how fast they kill them as if it's totally necessary. Why?  Maybe because it's likely they have weapons behind the counter? If you  rob a european store you don't have to fear any weapons."
You claim that armed robberies and killings don't happen in Europe because of gun laws. To disprove your claim I only need to provide one example of an armed robbery in Europe which proves that armed robberies do indeed happen in Europe DESPITE the existence of gun laws.
You believe providing an example of a non-armed,  robbery in Europe is evidence that armed robberies NEVER happen in Europe. This is an illogical conclusion and you probably realize that yet you don't want to acknowledge it because it clashes with your beliefs.
If everyone were carrying concealed it would be the best deterrent for crime there could possibly be.
I agree with you that it wouldn't solve 100% of crimes as that is just utopian and there will always be people who are just plain evil and will hurt others even when it puts themselves at risk.
But in the specific case of that psycho with the knife walking up to and stabbing the other guy with his knife you should at least recognize that this death could have been prevented if the victim was carrying a gun on him. From the way the car pulled up suspiciously next to him and the guy jumped out before even waiting for it to come to a full stop and went straight to the victim while flashing his knife, this death would have been 100% preventable if the victim had put a few rounds into the assailant.

You either didn't read or umderstand the article. The price premium is measured in dollar value, not of their native currency. Ie. It takes ~12.5k USD worth of their local currency to buy one Bitcoin whereas globally the average price is around 10.3k.

I believe that the Founding Fathers intended for 2A to guarantee the populace's right to arm themselves to the degree at which they attain parity with the military, domestic and foreign. So with today's military capabilities that would include drones and AA systems too as well as many other technologies and weapons currently outlawed for private citizens. In effect all common laws that limit and restrict the use of weapon are anti-Constitutional. So I agree with you on this issue.
But the answer can't be to restrict our ability to be armed even further by taking away our guns too and make it even easier for our government or foreign ones to control or destroy us.
Afghans proved that even a populace armed with AKs can overpower an army of trained soldiers, tanks, helicopters, artillery from the world's second greatest super power.
It's great that you live in a community where you don't feel the need to be able to defend yourself against them, but surely you recognize that this doesn't apply to everyone, but rather a minority of people.
In regards to the statistics you cited, note that they include suicides which highly inflates the numbers. But what's more important is that exclusing non-gun related homicides from your statistics skews the bigger picture. Is a murder commited with a knife more morally acceptable than one commited with a gun? Surely not. 
When you look at total homicide rates and account for population differences you will find that the death rate between US and European countries narrows significantly and isn't even close to 5-10 times as high.
In conclusion, we shouldn't restrict anyone's ability to arm themselves to any degree.

Wrong. Only ~8% of violent crimes commited in the US involve firearms. Meaning only roughly 16.000 out of those 200.000 defensive gun uses involved criminals with guns. The other 184.000 cases involved an armed citizen legally defending himself against an unarmed or armed with knives, bats etc. criminal.
Criminality in the US (when accounting for population size) is actually significantly lower in the US than in other developed nations like the UK, Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Canada, Norway etc., partially because citizens in those countries don't have the nevessary tools to effectively defend themselves (i.e. guns).
If you don't believe me then verify the information for yourself:
I once believed in gun control too, before I looked at the statistics myself and realized that the narrative being spun about legal gun ownership resulting in more crimes is completely false.

I don't care whether anyone agrees with me or not. Truth isn't dependent on popularity. Hate speech is a term invented by central planners with the intent of invalidating freedom of speech by segmenting and outlawing certain parts of speech and selectively enforcing these laws to control the flow of information and silence any political opposition.
If your point is that saying: "I hate [insert person/ethnicity/political group]" is 'hate speech' because it includes the word hate then you are missing the point. We don't differentiate other speech by calling it "supportive speech", "critical speech" etc. because all speech is free. This is assuming you live in the US where the Constitution actually grants you that right.
