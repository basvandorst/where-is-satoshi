That's hilarious material.

I tried to buy a kids playset at WalMart with my Wells Fargo credit card, and after plugging in all my information, going through a whole "verified by Visa" process, they denied my card anyway because I'd "never spent [X dollars] at WalMart before." They also cancelled the payments on dinner the previous night, and 2 shopping trips from days before that they hadn't processed yet. Because... I don't know why.
My argument that "Verified by Visa" means nothing if you're going to deny it anyway despite verification, and the fact that I've never spend $2 at Rite Aid before either and I'm curious if they would deny that transaction was not particularly persuasive. 
Anyway, it got worked out after 30 minutes or so. Awesome.  =\

would possibly like this.

Oh, sorry. I don't post there either. I thought they'd think it was neat. Apparently they're just dicks about data though.

Uh... no. Don't.

I can't honestly not see why "Verified by Visa" was implemented if it's just another hoop to jump through before denying a credit card purchase anyway. I'm already covered for fraud prevention, so all this was of no benefit to me. Pretending like it is would be disingenuous at best.

I don't think anyone minds cold storage. I think your downvotes are from saying "A while back I hid a few thousand dollars in my house, but I'm not going to bother to look for it to make sure I know where it is." 
I know I find it weird. Hell, send me your hard drives and keys, I'll look.

I missed the date at the start of and got excited. I thought I was going to buy up a bunch at $5.

And Gates is talking about change in the next 15. With the speed of technology being what it is, that just may be doable. No one's saying this happens in 2015.

I thought that was today? Ah, what a sticky situation. Quite a mess on my hands now.

You're not Greg S. You're Greg R. You're a big fat phony!

Without the Gregs of the world BTC wouldn't have gained the notoriety and interest that it has. Don't be a Greg now, but thank the Gregs of then.

Not until bitcoin isn't a pain in the ass for grandpa to set up, acquire, store, and understand.
