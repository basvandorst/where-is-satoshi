I'm thinking in changing wallet. Can you tell me the best one? (software).
Someone told me the BRD is very good.. Is it?
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:23:56
Of course, after.
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:03:05
All the pessimists are “redittors for 3 months”... FUD? 
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:13:39
The great bull run of 17 will be no more than a short sprint compared with the future ahead. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:41:33
And why should I believe in you? Why BTC is in deep trouble? Nice try. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:19:16
Longer time in the community. Longer you know that is not that bad of a fall. Maybe it’s a coincidence, maybe not. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:49:34
Still not convinced. You are new in this game. Zoom out fools. 
Today is a 1.5 drop. Damn, T-Mobile had a higher drop. So do you think that T-Mobile it’s not going to around in two years?
@_date: 2018-10-17 18:03:38
Wow... Just...... WOW&gt;. 
For Real? 
@_date: 2019-08-09 00:52:43
Damn. This is the first time seeing this LN tip. 
This is genius!!
@_date: 2019-08-03 03:37:29
Brazilian here. We already start the let’s fuck everything up project this year. Everything is going according to plan
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:54:20
Can you explain if it’s good or bad?
@_date: 2019-10-07 00:13:08
How come BTC is not ATH right now? In time of world crisis (China, Venezuela and other) is when we are seeing how valuable decentralized money really is.

In 10 years this you will regret so much of doing this.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:08:05
Don’t worry. 
If you are planing in Hodl it does not matter if you bought 11 or 13. Imagine 100,000 or 500,000. You are good.
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:36:24
Because Im following BTC for the last 5 years. 
There’s nothing new in the past few days.
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:50:50
What are the obviously reason to run a full node? There’s any money involved in running one at all? Or you are just helping the community? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:18:46
I sure did. But of course and nice and polite reply direct from the community is always better. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:32:50
If he cut the shouting and hair in 90%, he would be a good presenter. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:45:18
Do you mind explaining with more details, please. 
I’m sure a lot of people is having issues with this fork right now! Thanks!!
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:52:11
RemindMe! 3 years
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:37:53
RemindMe! 6 months
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:24:16
Thank you! 
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:53:18
That would be awesome
@_date: 2018-07-20 18:03:22
I have the same curiosity..
How does that reddit bot works? that you put a date and reminds you? I would love to compare
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:23:05
well, in someways every investment is a gamble..
Some more risky other less. The best odds at a cassino is what? 49%? Well, BTC have way better odds than that!
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:18:15
thank you very much!
Just to be clear, if my BTC is on my Electrum Wallet, it's valid?
When the fork is happening, exactly?
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:31:29
Man, I want the guide as well!
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:53:12
-Wait, that’s my mom’s name. 
-really? Mine too!! Have some swag. 
-Thanks. 
-this makes no sense whatsoever... 
-I know, son. I know. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:24:32
The problem was on my side.. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:13:19
Yeah, but to be honest, if we keep hovering around 9k, means that BTC had not yet made mainstream. 
Imagine how much will suck if next year we are crossing 9k again...I'm looking fwd to cross 90k. I want to pay my rent, groceries, lambos with crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:54:24
That would be fun!   
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:27:45
At least 3.
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:38:31
At that time, all stocks will be bought with BTC
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:28:22
Depend how you see it.The 180424, 180427, 180502 are very close... Its like we pass 9000 to 9001 then 8999 to 9003 in tree days.. I would count just as 1, right?
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:09:51
11 USD minimum wage? 
I’m a friendly Brazilian. PM me and I will send you a couple of minimum wages in BTC to help someone you know.
Good luck out there. 
Stay safe

If you don’t know it yet, research the pizza guy. 
After his story, I’m HODLing forever. Until BTC is a main currency.
