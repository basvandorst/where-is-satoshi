That's pretty sweet and how it should be. Customer should pay for the PayPal buyer protection if they want it.
Unfortunately, companies like Visa often have it in their contract that you can't pass the fee to the customer if you want to accept Visa. Dirty tactic.

Unlike BitPay, PayPal provides payment protection. BitPay is seller-friendly and PayPal is more consumer-friendly. Merchants would be under pressure to pay the fee to access the PayPal customer base.

The main advantage isn't that you don't need third parties, it's that no one controls the currency. Third parties (online wallets, apps, payment processors) help you USE the currency, but the backbone itself is still decentralized. If tomorrow you decided Bitpay isn't trustworthy, you can easily switch to someone else, since Bitpay has no control over Bitcoin itself.

That's why you have companies like Bitpay providing instant confirmation for a fee (they swallow the loss if the transaction later fails or exchange rate changes). This way the currency itself is decentralized, but you can still put your trust in middlemen who provide convenient processing.
