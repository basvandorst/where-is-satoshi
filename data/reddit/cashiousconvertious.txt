If Bitcoin can defend against Ver then it's actual value will increase significantly.
If it can't then it's a flawed concept.

You, as an entity, are entirely irrelevant as an economic actor when it comes to economic theory and policy.
At best "you", as an individual, are seen as a inconvenient time lag in the transfer of money and assets between small businesses in aggregate to a consistent share of large multinationals (sugar drinks, electronics, food, and chairs).
These multinationals purchase machinery to make their production process more efficient, that is what is being referred to when 'spend' is referred to- not whether you buy 2 cans of Red Bull or 3 cans of Red Bull. Smart people understand that those decisions are largely within the margin of error.
What matters is whether Red Bell Co are able to produce cans with 2% waste or 1% waste, and whether the production time is 0.5 seconds per can, or 0.48 seconds per can.
If prices are expected to deflate by **x**% and the cost to borrow is i%, then spending **q** million dollars on a new machine will only be done when the efficiency gains are more than some function of **x+i**%.
If prices instead inflate by **y**%, then spending on investment can be done at **i-y**%. That's what spend means. No one cares what you do, you're entirely irrelevant.

So if I move my bitcoin after the split to another address I own, a malicious agent can use that same command to rebroadcast that transaction on the B2X chain, right?
But wouldn't that just move the B2X coins to the same address I already own on the B2X chain? Rebroadcasting cannot change the destination address can it?
So if I'm the only one with the target address details, that isn't an issue, right?
My understanding was that if you made a virgin transaction to a third party, that third party (or a malicious agent) could redo that transaction on both chains. Effectively gaining both coins.

If you don't understand those things, how could you possibly be able to sell B2X coins?

I see.
So if you get together with someone who really likes your house, and you really like money, you can bet on a coin flip.
Heads you win my house, tails I win your money.
And then a second bet, Heads I win your money, tails you win my house.
Or let's get creative. Flip one hundred times, if a tails is hit at any time then I win your money. If a heads is hit then you win my house. Then it's not certain right? Who knows what could happen?
It's just two people gambling- right? So no taxes apply.
In reality, all assets implicitly convert and have capital gains due regardless of how an asset is disposed of.
If you 'gift' it to someone (here, have a house son), you owe the capital gains as if sold at market price.
If you 'throw away' an asset (I didn't like that $2 mill painting so I chucked it), then you owe the capital gains as if sold at market price.
If you 'sell' it at below market price (take my house for $1 bro), then you owe the capital gains as if sold at market price.
All these tricks that you think exist, don't. Every method of disposal has a market price test applied to it. You might be able to tax dodge to escape it- but that's what you're doing. And if your tax agency finds out you'll be assumed to be acting maliciously by default.
Gambling gains/losses is only tax free when directly using post-tax cash equivalents.

Think about this for just a second.
Banks have 'rows and rows' of servers. But what process do banks actually need to complete to complete a batch of transactions?
Receive a few requests, verify the requests, send the transaction batch to a processor, or multiple transactions to multiple processors. Balance against the incoming/outgoings at end of day.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, has to solve multiple increasingly difficult maths problems via brute force. Every attempt that isn't successful is wasted energy. And by design, there has to be an overwhelming majority that are unsuccessful as otherwise manipulation can occur.
The energy cost of completing that puzzle increase with usage and price. The number of unsuccessful attempts is likely to increase as well.
The amount of wasted power, if Bitcoin was actually doing anywhere close to the number of transactions that banks were doing, would be unimaginable.
The 'rows and rows' of Bitcoin already exist, with 0.000000000000001% the transaction volume. The individual computers are just distributed.

That ICOs concept, implementation, and justification all hurt my brain in different ways.

I'm fairly sure SJWism has very little to do with energy consumption.
They didn't call PoW racist, they called it wasteful compared to PoS.
