Feeling the same about alts atm, will there even be an alt season. . .
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:49:52
Yeah I know that but we’re talking about buying and selling within regulation now, avoiding a prison sentence or hefty fine specifically.
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:49:18
EUR/GBP? Is there KYC or just email.
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:02:41
Ouija has proved itself before, it gives actual numbers!
@_date: 2019-07-18 08:05:38
Moving forward, looking to the future.
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:53:24
China 
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:09:00
But still, like $298,000 profit.
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:06:42
Might sign up to bitbay then!
@_date: 2019-07-25 12:33:01
@_date: 2019-07-06 17:32:47
Buy coin instead.
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:39:13
How much are you starting with?
@_date: 2019-07-11 06:24:11
Looks like I was right. . .
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:09:20
Set up a scam that is more legit than the current ones.
@_date: 2019-07-16 15:53:46
How much do you want to buy?
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:12:21
This address will keep your coin safe and off the exchange:
@_date: 2019-07-03 06:55:18
Fucking hope so. . . Shitcoins, literally.
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:41:25
Have you used this exchange personally?
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:59:35
Alt coins, trade to BTC, rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:05:03
Free money is free money.
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:54:01
I was going to do the same, but that wouldn’t be true to my username. . .
@_date: 2019-07-25 12:42:02
Wish it held true. . .
@_date: 2019-07-06 18:00:10
China keeps on top of that.
@_date: 2019-07-15 06:39:30
Then it’s not a pass phrase, good joke haha!
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:18:02
No, this is the actual address:
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:02:32
For €2 BTC it might be worth haha, yeah I signed up but fuck KYC, dump email address lol
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:15:04
It’s a good deal! Why not send me 1-3 BTC and I’ll send you 2-5 BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-01 12:15:12
More like disbelief or hope.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:58:17
Long or short, the only predictions.
@_date: 2019-07-06 17:36:47
All you will receive is a ban. . .
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:51:20
Yuhp, why hold BTC if you don’t intend on selling it for profit, he could use it of course but it’s treated as an asset now by the government when it comes to buying and selling.
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:39:09
It’s the same for any crypto in the UK at the moment, all legal, but you will have to pay HMRC tax on any significant money made when cashing out IF your going to avoid possible consequences in the future, crypto is treated as property here.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:47:11
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:50:06
As far as I’m aware, in the eyes of HMRC he shouldn’t have crypto anyway, with all the KYC 18+ and stuff that’s been pressured on to us, I guess it’s hold till 18 before selling lol.
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:40:04
We’ll let you know when it’s over, who the hell can predict that.
@_date: 2019-07-04 20:12:18
I wish I had that amount. . .
@_date: 2019-07-15 06:25:21
Invalid phrase.
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:05:18
Not true, how can you “lose” money that you never had to begin with. . .
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:42:58
Good story man and good on you, wish you all the best, invest and be free.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:14:55
We had BTC is 2011, over 250 if I remember rightly, oh the DMT we smoked, not sure it was worth it now.
Hindsight 20/20.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:55:47
Obviously jealousy.
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:27:54
She’s got other motives, my ouija board told me so.
@_date: 2019-07-12 23:03:27
Who knows, personal goals! One mans happy with 50k profit, another man 5k.
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:14:03
We’re talking about reporting capital gains to HMRC, not owning or receiving BTC, read the comments.
@_date: 2019-03-23 01:53:31
Use limit orders instead?
@_date: 2019-03-14 21:36:06
Nice amount, you don’t want to go through KYC I take it? 
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:55:06
I’m just going to keep buying until the day I’ve made a decent amount of money out of nowhere, I guess. . . lol
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:22:12
I’m in the UK as well, what number would I get if I bought now/soon, the lower the better ;)
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:34:13
Can’t be long now, I’m hoping it won’t start for another 12-18 months though.
@_date: 2019-03-21 22:34:48
Pretty funny, there a site where they get this info or what?
@_date: 2019-03-25 20:51:50
I’m still in love with your art, been tracking my wallet too, excited for that to finally arrive!
@_date: 2019-03-23 20:46:02
I’ll have a sample miner if you’re offering them out.
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:38:48
Probably bad practice or forced to, we’re seeing more and more of these non KYC/P2P exchanges being forced to conform or get fucked basically.
@_date: 2019-03-08 18:00:33
Okay no problem man that’s fine, I’ll hit you up in a few days then if that’s okay?
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:29:16
There is no regulation in place, anything goes in the Wild West of cryptocurrency!
@_date: 2019-03-21 20:16:25
It’s so cringe, at least make it sound believable lol
@_date: 2019-03-21 16:15:10
br me? Lol
@_date: 2019-03-25 21:13:41
Remember to let me know when your getting the .1-.5 ones ready, I’ll need to keep some money laying around for those, I still need to hit you up with my email at some point though!
@_date: 2019-03-20 05:58:21
Send the BTC to me and I’ll transfer you the 50K through a fintech bank ����
@_date: 2019-03-30 08:04:37
Not too bad I guess, but still. . . Binance is for crypto to crypto, why you conform kraken?!
@_date: 2019-03-21 08:31:12
Send the number to me in a pm, I’ll find the real owner, I’m sure you would be rewarded for it.
@_date: 2019-03-14 21:56:01
Kraken, Coinbase? 
@_date: 2019-03-22 01:10:06
Yeah I know about pwned, I do wonder where they get this info though lol
@_date: 2019-03-21 17:54:30
I want to see the email lol
@_date: 2019-11-30 18:39:56
It could be worth $0 or it could be worth $1m, anywhere in between!
@_date: 2019-03-14 21:32:08
Laugh your ass off at the next bull run?
@_date: 2019-03-08 17:57:31
Yeah it’s cool, I guess I could always spray the frame anyway, the font is not terrible but just a little bit standard, can you keep the number mentioned in your message for me for now, do you use discord? 
@_date: 2019-03-30 07:42:24
But not to deposit/withdraw crypto?
@_date: 2019-03-23 20:47:24
Go through revolut or something then they won’t know it came from an exchange.
@_date: 2019-03-23 02:37:04
Yeah sorry got confused, currently on a night shift lol
@_date: 2019-03-08 17:52:19
Nice man, quick question though, where are you based? Would have been nice to see more “tech” font and a silver/black frame! 
@_date: 2019-03-15 00:14:02
Disguise is easily disguised.
@_date: 2019-03-14 21:30:26
How much BTC do you want to sell?
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:09:42
Let’s hope we all hit the big time with it, either way.
@_date: 2019-08-06 04:50:51
Well, I’m not lying. . .
@_date: 2019-08-05 10:03:12
Revolut fucked up when they banned transfers to everything but coinbase, same with fire bank.
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:03:48
London is in the UK. . .
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:20:16
You do know what brexit is? London and the UK won’t be a part of the EU.
@_date: 2019-08-30 23:39:00
I asked first. . .
@_date: 2019-10-31 20:34:01
I offer 1.5BTC for $1,250, that guy is a rip off!
@_date: 2019-08-30 23:42:57
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:37:13
Kraken is alright mate, they made it mandatory to do KYC, looks like you’ve been out the game for a while?
@_date: 2019-10-18 13:16:04
In a Ponzi scheme kind of way. . . 
Depends on circulating supply, total supply and probably some other magical factors.
@_date: 2019-08-18 18:07:07
You should, but be sure to keep it safe. . .
@_date: 2019-08-06 04:46:00
PM me the private key and I’ll have your coin.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:00:58
Unless it didn’t? Depends on the price of another coin, no?
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:27:18
No idea, nobody does.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:42:41
Tbh, stopped buying crypto a while back, I’m just going to let it ride now, not putting anymore money in, if I do? I’ll use coinbase, but screw the fee. . .
@_date: 2019-08-30 17:15:34
What’s your private key. . .
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:36:59
BTC dominance means it won’t be number 1?
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:37:58
BTC dominance means it won’t be number 1?
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:40:43
Ohhhhkaaaay. . .
@_date: 2019-10-31 20:37:09
Link to your aunt? I need some coin too.
@_date: 2019-08-06 15:53:30
Don’t pay shit if you don’t sell. . .
@_date: 2019-08-01 23:20:30
Not really, not much has happened.
@_date: 2019-08-30 21:16:08
I don’t think I do lol
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:53:02
Sorry for your loss mate!
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:15:55
The vape shop near central accepts and sells BTC as well, from what I remember.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:37:34
People are scared, scared to enter the space AND scared to leave, we’re going to have to wait and see what happens in the future.
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:12:53
Then of course it’s going to have an effect on you too.
@_date: 2019-06-20 21:37:33
$10000, then all hell breaks loose across the whole market.
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:00:47
Lucky you lot, how about you send me some, I’m poor as a fucking pauper. . .
@_date: 2019-06-04 19:16:50
So is it, or isn’t it the fabled bull run I’ve been hearing about?
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:36:20
It’s going to be $1m?
@_date: 2019-06-21 07:25:07
Good for you, cunt.
@_date: 2019-06-20 05:03:10
Here’s hoping ����
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:25:51
100k. . . Nice time machine.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:21:24
It happens, it’s going to go back up, could be tomorrow, could be a year from now.
@_date: 2019-10-18 06:17:05
Probably quite a bit, and quite a bit of jail time to go with it.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:52:09
@_date: 2019-06-21 00:37:31
@_date: 2019-06-11 12:43:38
God I’m funny, if your feeling generous:
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:13:50
Send me between 0.01 - 0.1 and I’ll send you around 0.03 - 0.5!
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:26:48
Yuhp, they now control the market too probably.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:17:31
Why careful with altcoins? They follow too but slower.
@_date: 2019-06-11 14:06:02
Basically. . .
@_date: 2019-06-06 03:12:19
Fucking cocks.
@_date: 2019-06-11 14:38:56
Feel bad for you mate, that’s some life changing money.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:47:25
I agree completely, I feel like the people advocating for crypto in general are not providing enough real world comparisons and explanations regarding the usefulness of the technology, nobody even knows what coins are, they’re not aware of the utility provided at all, people are treating crypto as an investment instead of a revolution.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:42:11
You’re misunderstanding? New investors are scared to lose their money or believe its a ponzi, people invested don’t want to sell and miss out but are already at the mercy of the whales controlling the market.
@_date: 2019-06-04 21:40:00
Literally nothing can be done basically, go back in time and buy a shit ton of BTC? Yeah, I wish I could as well. . . This is why a lot of people keep spouting the Ponzi scheme theme, didn’t buy in early? You’re at the mercy of those who did.
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:17:57
Mistakes cost money, sorry for your loss, expensive lessons are the ones best learnt.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:16:34
You’re a clever one!
@_date: 2019-06-19 04:42:29
Should have named it “cancer” instead.
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:35:31
I’ll see a few miners but I’ll need some BTC as a deposit/insurance. . .
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:44:02
One machine is still $$$, I thought you mined? How come you don’t have any coin.
@_date: 2019-06-06 00:03:29
This is exactly how they’re controlling something that they will never be able to control, shifting the attention away from what it actually is, that way they’re ensuring it’s true potential can never be realised or utilised.
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:05:58
Justin sun pays you mean.
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:02:31
We know what happens to alts usually, they follow.
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:37:27
No, it means they want the money you “owe” them.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:32:26
Pump &amp; dump, that’s all they’ve got to do, to think I had the chance at being a current day whale back in 2010-2011, I’ll ride the wave with utility alt coins and get rich one day, not missing my opportunity this time.
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:36:00
It’s not a good time to buy when it’s high, low is perfect ����
@_date: 2019-04-13 23:04:13
Tell him BTC isn’t an investment, it’s a peer to peer digital currency, job done.
@_date: 2019-04-09 21:44:25
“Peer to peer” now we can’t even use it for its intended use. . .
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:11:55
Was a card used?
@_date: 2019-04-03 19:30:15
If you find out then please feel free to send me at least 1, I’ve been a good little boy all year, waiting for the bull run.
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:46:09
I hear they hold funds for 17 days or something, maybe I’m mistaken but I’m sure they do it for one or the other!
@_date: 2019-04-09 17:53:09
Log in and send me some of the BTC, I’ll confirm if it’s genuine.
@_date: 2019-04-30 23:11:03
I’d rather buy bitcoin though, who’s buying a party hat for near enough the same price? Wish I could remember my log in details now though lol
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:37:01
That’s because it’s obviously a joke, want my real address? Lol
@_date: 2019-04-22 07:31:05
Sounds great and I’d love to have a go but working full time with a small child is a no go for me �� hard times.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:40:49
You’ve posted this before, do you own it or something. . .
@_date: 2019-04-09 20:49:02
Trust wallet.
@_date: 2019-04-29 18:48:28
Just saying, it’s more than BTC has. . .
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:01:21
Depends when you bought. . . Obviously it’s going to go higher in the long run (opinion).
@_date: 2019-06-21 00:26:15
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:40:02
As I said, it works for small peer to peer transactions, not on a large scale. . . You are the brainwashed one.
@_date: 2019-04-03 23:05:06
Lmfao, I’m going down with the ship as we speak!
@_date: 2019-04-04 20:29:11
Yeah you get what I meant (are we heading there) I’m still confident it can pick back up, still around 20% up on last week so I’m not thinking about jumping out until we hit the full reversal either way.
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:11:42
You ask whatever price you want for website domains, they can be evaluated but in the end that doesn’t matter.
@_date: 2019-04-26 21:29:53
You’d do that for me?! Message me the number, I’d be gutted if I got hold of gold and silver but missed copper then though haha!
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:59:59
I can hold it for you on my ledger.
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:48:39
“Disbelief” or another bull trap. . .
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:00:36
Whales. . . they own a lot more than anyone else could afford to buy up, they’d dump and drown it.
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:32:05
In this case “overbought” might be “scarce”.
@_date: 2019-04-03 22:11:49
I hold, I buy. . . I never sell, well, maybe at 100k.
@_date: 2019-04-13 23:06:07
Oh god, more drama.
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:16:15
BTC is too slow for cross border payments unless it’s domestic peer to peer, will not work on a large scale.
@_date: 2019-04-03 21:39:32
We going to 100k?!. . .
@_date: 2019-04-29 21:21:32
Either way, if it was make me money then I couldn’t care less lol
@_date: 2019-04-22 06:59:14
Is there actually private keys in the map? Lol
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:17:25
Had a similar story, we used ours on Silk Road and never thought anything of it until literally 8 years later, fuck sake, we’d have had around 10m too. . . You’re not alone.
@_date: 2019-04-09 10:53:55
Same, but yesterday. . .
@_date: 2019-04-30 16:46:10
Don’t we all.
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:00:12
Bought the 1 BTC gold version, very nice indeed! Shame I couldn’t get the 0.5 silver in time so I’ll take a miss on the 0.1, got the gold one in a frame with a nice background image.
@_date: 2019-04-29 11:58:06
IOTA is feeless, I know what you’re saying but BTC won’t work for this, IOTA has been developed FOR this and has Jaguar and Land Rover on it’s side, cue the downvotes.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:58:59
Your thinking of buying it?
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:26:47
Ah, well if you sell now you risk losing your position and having to put potentially another $1k in just to get the same amount, if you hold and if it drops, buy more and dollar cost average your way down!
@_date: 2019-04-05 06:45:43
You’d be more believable if you had decent grammar, nobody adds capital letters to the start of random words. . . randomly through a sentence, especially not someone who is considered one of, if not, the greatest computer scientist of our time.
@_date: 2019-04-18 16:37:14
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:18:11
Then back down. . . Lol
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:17:27
It did last time.
@_date: 2019-09-12 06:02:59
All my savings/spare money goes into BTC and a few other select crypto’s. Not financial advice. . .
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:09:05
Title means what?
@_date: 2019-09-12 16:31:26
Someone’s done it?
@_date: 2019-09-12 06:21:05
Yuhp, I keep around £100 in the bank for fuel basically. . .
@_date: 2019-09-12 19:07:50
Pretty sure there’s a lot of bitcoin that could buy your club John. . .
@_date: 2019-09-26 06:03:05
Probably won’t, nobody is going to take that name seriously, let alone waste their time watching it.
@_date: 2019-09-12 06:23:40
Only way to get rich.
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:23:15
@_date: 2019-09-29 07:23:01
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:28:15
Jesus. . . Dump incoming?
@_date: 2019-09-29 09:00:27
Probably go back down more tbh, not advice, nobody except the whales will know.
@_date: 2019-09-08 17:05:18
He used cash.

Thanks mate, honestly that’s my dream, being able to ensure a bright and secure future for my kid, I’m not particularly bothered about living the high life, I’ll continue to work once the dream is achieved, I plan on living normally but without the monthly financial worry’s, wish you all the best, I’m sure we’re all going to make it!
@_date: 2019-05-29 22:31:10
Well I hope you’re right, either way it’s going to get there sooner rather than later.

To be honest, kid got lucky and that’s all. When BTC was $3 we actually USED it to buy things. . . You know, like it was meant for. How can anyone become a billionaire without shear luck or a shit ton of money in the first place.

When alt season?!
@_date: 2019-05-29 01:41:32
I know most (if not all) alts have been losing value in sats but until we can use BTC or another coin to pay for things without the use of fiat I’ll have to continue to worry about the fiat value of cryptocurrency unfortunately.

God damn, I’m gunna set up a buy order for some ridiculously low amount and hope it goes through lol.
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:42:16
Yeah. . . not important, we’re going up whether you like it or not FUD.

How much are you looking for?
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:05:43
I often think about missing out on things, even missed out on BTC after knowing about it around 2010-2011, instead of living in the past, I look forward to the future. . .
@_date: 2019-05-29 01:03:40
Good advice, I’m an adult though and understand that being greedy will inevitably put me on my arse, as soon as I’ve hit my target I’m out, I just need alt coins to hit double what they were and that’s life changing for me and my family.
@_date: 2019-05-29 00:45:48
Well I’m more interested in the parabolic gains alt coins have to offer more than anything, my original plan was to sell them all as close to the next high as I can and use the money to go all in on BTC in the next bear, regarding the DCA at £50 a week, wouldn’t that be more costly if BTC increases its price every week or so as it has been?
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:42:27
50k?. . . Maybe!
@_date: 2019-05-28 22:02:08
What. . .
@_date: 2019-05-29 02:27:37
We’re very similar indeed my friend, my quality of life is also a bag of shit thanks to working excessive hours in a physically demanding job.
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:17:35
Basically yes, until “regulators” are involved, even then I don’t really see how they’re going to stop it.
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:54:37
The future is obviously bright, I’m taking my chances with a few of the decent performers in the alt coin market, when the next run occurs I’ll cash out and wait for the next bear to buy into BTC again, also the remaining coins that have utility and working products.
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:11:00
Buy any and all crypto! We’re all going to the moon baby.
@_date: 2019-05-29 02:29:31
You are completely right, although I’m sticking to alts with working products that show potential and have also been around a while, definitely going to open a BTC position though regardless.
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:49:43
Well they must be REALLY stupid. . .
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:00:36
Nothing you can do either way, sorry mate.
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:09:03
Hence quotation marks and the disbelief that would change anything. . .
