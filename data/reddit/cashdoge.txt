I don't understand the hostility. And please do check out the below subreddit and look at the timeline and such;

I highly doubt any other bigger companies like Coinbase will be gone any time soon. 
I mean, now that Circle is gone, what are most of their previous customers switching to? Sites like Coinbase, Gemini and such. This is great for their business and shutting down now would do more bad than good for them.

Sad to see the CEO of such a great Bitcoin exchange thinking that... Moving onto Gemini.

*Before you continue to assume stuff;*
I'm **all** for Bitcoin, anonymity as a whole &amp; WikiLeaks. I'd actually prefer it if WL wasn't compromised in the end and they continue posting. My point was to stop your hostility (which has continued in your newest post).

Funny to see countries of the balkans (Croatia &amp; Slovenia specifically) adopting Bitcoin much faster than countries like Russia which are **much** larger.
*Amazing post, by the way.*

I still doubt Coinbase &amp; Gemini will go any time soon.

Guess I got proven wrong once again.

The way you wrote it made it look like you can't access your funds and are angered by it. Which is why I said that you should have your keys backed up in case Coinbase/whichever web wallet provider you use goes down.

Not sure why you don't have your keys stored, but okay.
