Well I've spoke about backups. I'm using electrum at the moment and I'm going to back up in a safe and back up and keep it at work

I intend on putting more and more in. I'm mining anyway so thats slowly adding and then perhaps 10/20£ a week added into my wallet
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:26:53
Not invested a lot but I'm no ing and looking to out more in. Curiosity more than anything else but making some money wouldn't be bad 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:50:46
Don't ask me lol

I'm not dumping all my liquid into it just a little bit that I can comfortably handle losing
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:02:50
Oh I know. That's why I'm only putting what cash is 'spare into it

Slow. But my cards arnt the best. My mining won t make me A lot. It's more a trickle in of £1/2 a day. More intrigued by it tbh
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:40:04
I'm planning to mine and invest over time. Nothing stupid but it should be fun 
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:55:33
