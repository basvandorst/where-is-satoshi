What a wonderful idea, the bitcoin tournament was a huge success and since I love both StarCraft and bitcoin it would make me happy to see the two go together. Axiom is a wonderful team and TB is someone who has an audience that extends beyond just the esports side so sponsoring Axiom can potentially also get some attention from more than just the esports fans.

This seems to give some reason to believe that both of the recent BDD spikes could have indeed been caused by MtGox-controlled long-term (cold?) storage moving en masse. Thief in action or gox moving their btc for some reason?
@_date: 2014-03-02 14:05:58
What exactly would the scam here be?
@_date: 2014-03-02 09:34:14
Check  for how both of the massive spikes in bitcoin days destroyed from december and just before gox being closed seem to be from coins that had been sitting in place since early 2011. Actually from almost the exact same time MtGox ownership was changed from Jed McCaleb to Mark Karpeles. They can also be connected fairly strongly to the big transactions like the 424242.42... which are known to be initiated by Mt Gox.
@_date: 2014-03-02 12:19:25
So according to that principle it would be the most likely explanation, doesn't really rule out any others though.
Would Karpeles accomplish anything by moving it though? Aren't the funds more "undercover" as long as they're not touched? Creating the BDD spikes is like causing an earthquake.
@_date: 2014-03-02 11:34:22
What's the evidence that MtGox still has control of these funds? Couldn't they have been moved by the theoretical thief just as well?
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:19:21
Saw that comment but did not see how it made sense. The 400k is not mined directly to that address and all coins are mined at some point.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:08:14
Indeed we can't say for sure. I think it is more likely than not that an address that has held the same balance for years still has the same owner though. You just should not go around shouting you definitely found gox's wallet or something. Only that you found something interesting that could belong to them based on some supporting evidence.

If we are just talking about big-name individual streamers there is no reason to limit your choices to League of Legends.

I have seen people say they have been asked for verification at some point but personally I was able to move quite a few BTC out of the exchange even in 2013 IIRC without ever having verified. Maybe what I moved was under the limit of when they'd start asking for it just for BTC transfers though. Certainly I wouldn't just move 50k for some unverified user if I was MTGox. :P

Seems to me that chart generates at around 6PM so the peak is on the 6th, 6PM and the timeperiod it concerns is the previous 24 hours.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:14:11
As someone said on the other thread, every single bitcoin comes from freshly generated coins... so can you elaborate on what you mean?
You don't have to mine them yourself to obtain them, obviously and an exchange is a natural place for miners to put their coins on for selling.

Yeah viewers are invested enough to care about team sponsors. It applies to all sports. People are pretty emotional about whoever it is they support.
@_date: 2014-03-12 00:12:20
Hearthstone tournaments absolutely don't pull more. Casual streaming of HS does beat SC2 individual streaming though. CSGO tournaments do not either. It had 60k at the DHW you reference last year and that was viewed as a huge success relative to what had happened with CSGO previously. SC2 has managed to get up to 100k last year.
MLG has also been  getting back to SC2 and NASL is most likely dead for more than just SC2.
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:00:43
Oh, I was mistaken about the peak then. Didn't the article with the infographic that you linked talk about the ingame viewers only adding up to 120k and does not account for people that have both open (pretty likely to be a significant portion IMO).
100K for SC2 at that event is also pretty good and does not include the viewers watching on SVT's television channel, their live stream or on TV6. Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't those channels only send SC2?
As for your life support comments, I think the best thing to do then if you only care about the big numbers is to invest in what is big right now. Then again smaller sports manage to somehow pull in sponsors so I don't know why you would only consider the number one in esports either, especially when it's likely there is some difference in demographics.

They might go to jail for negligence in some places even without a malicious intent.

Which random teamless streamers get so many viewers? Could it be that these random LoL twitch streamers are 1. part of LCS teams and advertise only through their team so they are not all that "random" 2. significantly more in demand by advertisers since most people will think the same as you. These two things together make their price a fair bit higher (and of course in the worst case Riot could have something against advertising bitcoin).
There are reasons why there aren't only advertisements in the single most popular sport at any given time.
Also, if we're just talking about random independent streamers, there are many more hugely popular and underutilized options than just LoL. Go to a personality playing multiple games like Kripp, or Hearthstone that is a strongly growing eSport, or even speedrunning.

It hasn't really declined so heavily although it is a bit down from the hype that it got at the release of the expansion. SC2 fans could be a better audience for Bitcoin than some other games too...
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:56:53
How annoying. The region-specific pricing is already bad and now it even prevents bitcoin purchases...
@_date: 2014-03-02 10:41:39
Does that quote from MagicalTux at the end about spending a week's income actually relate to malleability in any way? I thought they were saying he accidentally sent the bitcoins to null due to a bug in his code.
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:25:02
What, it's still the strongest outside of the MOBAs in my opinion. DotA2 is kinda meh. If you want to sponsor that type of a game, why not just go LoL.

It does seem like the coins that got moved were related to MTGox. Actually even the earlier big spike in december seems to be although it's definitely not conclusive evidence in either case.
See this ttp://
The pastebin lists some of the addresses that were the cause of the spike on the 7th. At least one of those is a few transactions away from the MTGox donation address from 2010 so it seems plausible it could still have been under their control. The earlier spike moved at least some coins from addresses that were initially set up the same or previous day as the ones in the later and there is some more reason to believe also those could have been under MTGox control.
So big the question is: this a thief grabbing 200-300k BTC from the oldest of Gox reserves or are they transfers that someone at Mt. Gox initiated. At the very least it points to Gox coins not having been left untouched and makes it seem possible that vasts amounts of BTC could have been lost to theft.
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:42:43
Yeah, probably true that personal streams in total are down, individual streamers can still be doing well though. Some players that used to get high numbers have quit and SC2 is such a hard game that it limits the amount of viewer interaction a lot so most people tend to primarily watch tournaments.

You can get Steam gift cards by first getting Zeevex cards from Gyft.
@_date: 2013-07-15 12:19:28
I'm from europe and have tried the zeevex route, it does work. Steam converts the dollars to whatever currency you are using there when you redeem the card.

It's really awesome for a showmatch.
