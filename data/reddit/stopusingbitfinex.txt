Bitfinex it's very bed exchange
1. They hold withdrawals.
2. It's not possible to open order or close on time. It's lagging
3. Support poor.
4. Suspicions that manipulates
5. Dishonest to clients. Deposit is fast withdrawals slow.
6. When try to open order for example limit or stop. It's take 1 min and more to wait for loading. 
Conclusion they can't manage with current load
And most importantly they chart for such bed service a lot. But hey don't take the risk. We investors and traders take high risk.
I will agitate and protest. Till when they will not fist alt and will not compensate lost. 
I lost thousand because of lagging website.
WE NEED TO TO CLAIM ALL WHO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THIS EXCHANGE
Or stay foolish. Choose who you want to be a fighter or fool
