"We've been having trouble with the Coinbase integration and it seems like we have to (re) approve our store to access the Coinbase API once or twice a day."
gogameguru.com support told me... maybe it's the same issue

@_date: 2015-05-01 14:22:18

No, you can lock one output with 2 addresses (multisig).
At least thats what i tried to say.

"Some newer wallets may have numbers as large as  2^512 (~ 10^154)." lol this is just stupid because 2x 2^256 does in security not eaqual 1x 2^512! imagine a two password lock (like two factor), you enter your first password, and then the second one. if the second one fails you dont try a new first password because thats just stupid, because it worked before
edit: to clarify:  2^512 is wrong, correct is 2*2^256 wich is WAY smaller

The whitepaper defines what bitcoin is
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:48:32
the coins were unspendable because they were sent to segwit addresses. the miners now sent the coins to the originally intended receiver.

you should metion that if twisterd is going to run on a multi user system, then a config with rpcuser and rpcpassword should be created because otherwise other userers could see the rpcuser and password (with htop for example)
@_date: 2013-05-19 11:03:08
please don't do any research about satoshi nakamoto,
its better to don't know who created bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:58:12
Change 
"ufw allow 22
ufw allow 8333"
"to ufw allow 22/tcp
ufw allow 8333/tcp"

i just enabled javascript to give this post a downvote.
THIS is the bitcoin community, WHY can't you life with it?
look at if there would be a need for a "cleaner" community, would be more active
basicly, just because you don't like it, don't regulate it.
try your own. if your idea is better, our community will shrink and yours will grow, at some point then has to change, because otherwise it would loose the userbase. this is the way to go

I asked them 13.01.13
Unfortunately we do not accept bitcoins.
