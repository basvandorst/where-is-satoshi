0 because I wasn't stupid enough to have funds stored in an exchange!

Two weeks from two weeks.

Yeah... That's not going to happen.

There's no way this browser gets popular enough for that.

What happened with the sale?

That's a 0 confirmation transaction. You're BTC still have not left your wallet, Bitpay just sees that you sent out a transaction for it. Steam can take a 0 confirmation transaction because it's extremely simple for them to cancel the order if you end up double-spending or the transaction sits in limbo waiting on confirmations. Any other non-digital store can't (well shouldn't) ever accept a 0 confirmation transaction, which means you'll have to wait hours for confirmations.

They might not know what a block size is, but they do know that their transactions are taking hours upon hours.

That's not Mt. Gox.

So don't use Bitcoin unless you're Wikileaks and transferring over $1000 at a time?

I'm not a stock broker, but 2.4% seems like normal fluctuation.

Because they're making money.

What do you pay for? Stock info?

It can be profitable if you have 10,000+ cpu's mining for you and you aren't paying for the power or internet.

Yeah, there's no way I'm switching to this random web browser from chrome just so I can pay people. I might use a chrome addon, but not switching browsers entirely.
@_date: 2016-10-07 22:29:09
Because the US has money.

In another comment he said he bought his house in Kansas. Kansas is in the US which means the IRS applies to OP.

If you're not a troll:

If you're lucky enough to find a seller who will pay fiat in return for your btc.
@_date: 2016-07-16 18:49:42
Is there any other way that I can convert my BTC to USD and withdraw to my bank account with 0 fee? Unless there is, I'll still be using Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-07-29 18:32:19
Did no one learn from Mt. Gox? You don't keep any coins in an exchange for longer than it takes to trade them. Exchanges are meant to exchange, not store, coins.
