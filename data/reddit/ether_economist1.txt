The **joke** is that everyone in screams 'stop censorship!!' when deletes posts here about XT and wants him removed as a mod, but when gavin starts deleting comments on github PR's theres no problem with that?
Nothing worse than hypocrites... Theymos should be removed as a mod, and if Gavin keeps removing comments on-topic PR comments he should lose commit access.

XT was not hard work. Look at the github commits, they actually just changed 1 line of code to raise the limit to 8MB, and a few more lines to grow it over time.
Nothing difficult about it, and no scientific research was done prior to make sure that the numbers made sense.
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:40:53

Relax, I removed the comment because theres no way to verify authenticity.  Those logs posted on piratepad when the whole hashfast collapse went down which may or not have been bullshit...  I think you're well aware that there are lots of unhappy hashfast customers who want to know the truth behind the hashfast lawsuit alleging you were paid 3000 BTC from hashfast in return for promoting their products on bitcointalk. Did you ever mention that Hashfast was paying you as an employee or contractor while you promoted their products?  Don't be surprised if people are upset or angry when they hear about these things considering that they lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Peter is right. Gavin's numbers didnt have any proper research behind them. The core devs did proper research. That's why they didn't support his reckless proposal.
@_date: 2015-08-21 03:39:53
I stand corrected then. For all the posts on BCT about this I somehow missed that.
@_date: 2015-08-10 01:04:59
This is OFF TOPIC, just like other Bitcoin crowd funded projects like Ethereum.  Why do the mods ban Ethereum stories but allow other off topic items?  Agenda driven? 
@_date: 2015-08-24 02:35:27
yes but scanning the whole ipv4 space isn't easy, infact i bet you could't write a step by step process on how to do it, it requires quite a bit of research and the right tools

Relax, it's a figure of speech said sarcastically... It's no secret that you are on almost every thread promoting Mike/Gavins proposals.  I'm not actually insinuating that anyone is paying anyone anything, but deleted the post just incase it comes off that way.
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:02:07
Mike and gaving have done some heavy damage to Bitcoin... He couldn't reach consensus with the other devs so him and Gavin threw a tantrum. Since XT was released, BBC, Bloomberg, and other media outlets have been running 'bitcoin forking' stories, and the price has been crashing.  Now we find out that XT bans TOR nodes.  What a shit show.
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:37:42
It's not so easy or you would have already found the prize.
IPv6 is impossible due to the address size.  More than all the particles in the universe.
@_date: 2015-08-22 00:38:31


I don't think just because the other side thinks differently they're intellectually inferior.  Nor do I know who's a genius, and who's an idiot. The mob is simply just misinformed on this particular topic.
Blocks are not consistently full.  With a small fee you are still guranteed to be in the next block. Bitcoin is not stagnating.  Myself and all the core devleopers agree that a larger block size is needed.  Mike and Gaving are not going about it in the right way.   
And by the way, for Bitcoin to scale as-is to every transaction in the world we would need 1TB blocks.  It's simply not something that can continue to be decentralized at scale.  Other soltuions are needed, not just chanign the code to have 8MB, 8GB, or 1TB blocks.

unless they're actually a mob...  They've fully ignored the fundamental centralization and technical risks that the Core devs have specifically pointed out XT introduces.
Or are you purporting that the average is more technically inclined than the core devs?

@_date: 2015-08-20 05:34:53
So, pointing out that Bitcoin XT has an anti-privacy, IP Blacklisting trojan in it is  "Classic" "Anti-XT"?
You bet it's anti XT. Pro-XT'ers are so maniacal now that they want to kill off privacy?  Unbelievable.
Mike Hearn pushed through some seriously bad patches in XT, and the mob is following merrily along.
He tried and filed to shove these patches into Core, but used the 8MB block mob to do it in XT. Very Sad.
@_date: 2015-08-23 23:29:35
It is time consuming, setting up the code/scanning software takes time.  Perhaps an hour or two. Then you have to parse the response from potentially hundreds of thousands of matches.  It's costly in terms of labor, and if you need to use a lot of bandwidth do to the scan, that can add up for a lot of people.  "Easy" would be clicking a button.
@_date: 2015-08-29 21:41:25

Something that is time consuming, costly, and associated with quite a bit of risk doesn't fit the definition of 'easy'.  You just proved my point.
@_date: 2015-08-20 05:36:24
Fully Agree. XT should not be trusted with these IP blacklisting lists.

Or you could argue that The people DoSing XT nodes are protecting Bitcoin, not shilling.
@_date: 2015-09-03 21:25:20


Which is why raising the block limit isn't immenantly urgent, and XT is making a fuss out of nothing. The core devs will fix the issue soon in a responsible way
@_date: 2015-09-03 21:24:28
That's just the market taking care of things.  If XT had more support, it would be able to fend of DDoS attacks.

Yes they are. Consensus takes time.  In fact, there are two workshops set up over the next 3 months to solve the block size issue in person.
@_date: 2015-09-03 03:26:16
Yes, Ethereum is much more advanced.
@_date: 2015-09-02 21:38:08
As there shouldn't be.
Solutions are proposed and discussed at the workshops, and then consensus is reached online at a later date.

Yes I know this. The question I was alluding to is how many Bitcoin Days Destroyed have been generated by Coinkite wallets?  Processing $250M in transactions can be faked by a single user with 1000BTC and a bunch of wallets.
@_date: 2015-09-02 06:04:53
No.  I'd rather work with other smart developers and reach consensus.
Go enjoy your Mike Hearn dictatorship.

But if you use Bitcoin properly, you hold your own private keys, and there is nobody to regulate.

i can tell. ur mad.
@_date: 2015-09-02 21:37:01
No, they don't need a workshop to understand the issues.
They are meeting in person because it speeds up solving the problem vs. communicating only online.
@_date: 2015-09-09 07:30:08
u mad?
@_date: 2015-09-18 21:15:22
Why does nobody mention that transaction volumes are a useless metric.  Bitcoin days destroyed is what matters. A single Coinkite client could be sending BTC to their own addresses over and over to fake volume.  Would like to know how many daily and monthly active users Coinkite has which is a useful metric.
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:30:54

All sorts of metrics on blockchain.info have been broken for years... 
@_date: 2015-09-16 21:39:25
The problem with this post is that someone transferring Bitcoins to their own address would be counted multiple times.
It's like Blockchain.info's wallet page... it says they've done $50 BILLION in transactions.  Well, most of that is just people moving coins between their own wallets.  So, these metrics aren't useful.
How about posting what your active daily/monthly user rates are?  Those are useful metrics to seeing how many people are actually using bitcoin.  It's too easy to fake transaction volume.
@_date: 2015-09-16 22:03:09

It's the same developers for the most part.   Bitcoin functionality hasn't changed much at all, it's just about a hundred times more efficient and faster than it was when it launched.
@_date: 2015-09-22 18:28:52
Actually, I'm correct. There is no free electricity anywhere.  And the economicts of price/difficulty right now plus the switch to PoS mean that mining Ethereum is a 100% money loser compared to just buying ETH.
100% correct. Fact.

Coinkite has a great product, but I've always found their marketing to be strange...
Why not just say $250M? Or even "25 basis points of a TRILLION dollars!!?!"
Also, It would be good to see numbers based on Bitcoin Days Destroyed, which is actually a useful metric.  The problem with counting BTC volume is that someone could just send 1000BTC back and forth 1000 times over 2 days and it doesn't mean anything...  
Blockchain.info has the same problem... they publically list the BTC volume and how many wallets are created... but not how many unique wallets are actually used each month by real users.
