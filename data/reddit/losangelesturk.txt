Exactly. Seggregated witness adds too much complexity for very little benefit.

I agree with your assessment, but sometimes it is better to stick with the evil that you know than the one that you don't. If Trump wins there is no guarantee that he will be friendly to bitcoin, in fact he may very well end up worse than Clinton. It would be wrong to associate bitcoin with Trump supporters. Having said that, I agree that Clinton is the very embodiment of everything that is wrong with American politics today.

What is the alternative?

Well, I hope you are right, or else him becoming a president would be a very scary prospect.

In those times the Nazis also made the same arguments about Jews. They accused them of an international conspiracy to destroy their country. Singling out people on the basis of their religion can easily escalate into something very ugly. Besides the prospect of having to declare your religious affiliation while crossing US customs is quite unsettling. This ban will only affect honest people, the radicals could very easily lie about their religion.

The reason why I do not want him is because of his rampant Islamophobia. As a Muslim who lives in the US I can never vote for someone like him.  Given his attitude towards Mexicans and other minorities, he looks like a hateful bigot. 
When Germans were voting for Hitler prior to WW2 they also thought they were doing the right think for their country. Look where it lead them. Let's hope that the United States does not end up the same.

And what makes you think that Trump's donors would be any different?
