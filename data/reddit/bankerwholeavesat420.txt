yes trip from ballot to mixer is public but the trip from mixer to end result/classification is why you wouldn't be able to assign it to an individual. it's just a suggestion anyway I'm sure they can come up with other ways to solve this problem. I think the point is that many don't trust the government, and blockchain solves the problem of trust. Perhaps you live in a country where the government is trusted but most of the world do not, I can see this system becoming especially useful in developing countries with political corruption.

Couldn't agree more. But at the same time, how can this happen? An institutional investor could dump a few billion into the system, but then they would own a lot of BTC and essentially be a 'majority shareholder' of bitcoin. It would take away from the community and the decentralized decision making aspects for a free market. Only other way I can see it happening is by the community over time, but it could take decades for that much capital to flow into the system.
@_date: 2016-04-18 18:33:10
They would like to, you mean. If the big entity holds a huge majority of BTC and choose not to sell, competition will be out of luck. Essentially, they will have control over what happens next.
@_date: 2016-04-18 21:45:19
We're talking about a billion dollar institutional investor. Considering the BTC market cap is around $6bn right now, if an institution dumped $4bn into it, they would be a majority holder. You hold 21 BTC out of over 14 million BTC, you are not a major holder.

"They probably tell you somewhere" is not mutually exclusive with "acting like they're not". And putting some legal text in their user agreement is not "telling you straight up".

They're not getting it for free, it's advertised as free. The charge is just at the execution of the trade at a lower point, by another entity that then pays the platform provider, which deceives the user into thinking the service is free (which the marketing supports). This is disingenuous at the very least and does not go along with a corporation that positions itself as otherwise.

i'm pretty sure credit checks are a US-only thing.. so isn't it retarded to use that system for a global business that is based on a decentralized currency? like even if it were an acceptable thing to ask for, why would you use a system that can only verify your customers in a single country? unless coinbase is a US-only company ofc, which would then make me question their vision for bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:03:25
Can bitcoin be seized by the government the way cash is? Can they open wallet somehow and extract your coins and sell them?
@_date: 2015-01-31 22:08:17
I love your idea as a bitcoin enthusiast, but as a venture capitalist I must say your finance strategy is faulty. You're essentially having your future customers crowdfund the company. You would have much better luck if the financiers had some other incentive or benefit than someone who hasnt crowdfunded but will pay for wireless access in the future. I'm sure you can come up with a strategy to provide this. It will create incentivized investor value and will make funding your idea seem a lot more appealing!

they just scored $75m from private equity, pretty sure those investors would want to keep it private for now. also, listing on NYSE is a terrible move for a company of that size, they can save millions of dollars by listing on a smaller exchange and attract a higher percentage of market volume

You are taking my words out of context. I meant government and bitcoin don't mix for the purpose of the 80-20/currency argument, as in governments don't hold bitcoin as security.

6% investment with 2% inflation is really a 4% investment.. and if inflation goes up you're kind of screwed. you could always hire a wealth manager who can probably return you 60k adjusted for inflation.. but there's risk involved, so I wouldn't depend my living money on it.
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:37:08
good math, but the "80 percent of wealth is owned by 20 percent of people" thing is true for overall assets and net worth, not currency holdings. I'd say a majority of currency in the world is owned by governments, so it would really be more of a chaos theory thing to assume who would own the majority of bitcoin since governments and bitcoin don't really mix

have you guys gotten the necessary legal licenses for this? in order to hold clients' bitcoin you must be registered as a bank under NYS cryptocurrency law. I was working on a similar project that avoided this by never holding client funds, so I'm curious as to how you guys got around that
@_date: 2016-02-22 23:14:01
It could maybe cause a short term price fall with enough traction, but I don't see how these tactics would "bring down" Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:18:42
I agree that it does, but the money you would be storing is still stored at a bank, just by the person who sold BTC to you instead of you.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:38:24
Coinbase averages 12k of BTC trading vol on a given day. Halvening's effect would be about 900 BTC/day. That's like ~8% so definitely a decent impact, although not giant as some put it out to be. Even then, I think the price will be baked in 3-5 months before it goes into effect.
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:39:49
Only a small % do - the good ones. most keep it in memory, which is an awful practice

Yes, most smartphones in production already have this where they keep your biometrics information etc. Good software wallets already leverage this though, so no added benefit here.
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:49:37
Supply of bitcoin as in X/21M and supply of bitcoin to the markets to be traded (to affect the price) are two different things. The former is increasing at a static rate, the latter is static at 12.5BTC every ~10mins until the next halvening event.
The current supply rate to the markets is creating a 12.5BTC*~$5200=$65,000 sell pressure on the market every ~10mins. This sell pressure will be reduced to half at the next halvening event. According to basic economics theory, this will increase the price if we assume ceterus paribus conditions.

Sure. Ethereum had its ICO in 2015. If you own an Ether, you can send it to anyone or use it on any Smart Contract. Basically you get the right to use the processing power of the Ethereum Blockchain.
BCAP was an ICO on the Ethereum Blockchain. BCAP coins give you shares of Blockchain Capital Venture fund. They issued 10M coins for a $10M fund. In the future if the fund grows to, say $15M, then your BCAP coins should gain value proportionally.
There are hundreds of other examples, each its own case.

yes but there is no differentiation between a random bitcoin owner and someone who invests in the idea/company's future. so one might as well spend their money simply on bitcoin. every dollar spent on the crowdfund future wireless service could be used to buy bitcoin instead, so this actually creates an opportunity cost for the investor, thus decreasing investment value.

Right, and when ETH was initially offered, BTC was the currency (which makes ETH the security in your example)
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:43:56
The ICO stands for the initial offering of ETH. The SEC says that in both cases, the underlying asset is a security.
