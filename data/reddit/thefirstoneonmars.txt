Thing is, the US legal system is about *revenge*, not about justice or betterment of society.
That's really just the obvious result when judges are elected by popular vote.

What is it that you want to say? How about just saying it.

The boss of the gulf cartel also only got like 20 years or so. So it would not be surprising. I guess its pretty hard to actual prove all the crimes.

I don't think so.
The goal may be to force the government to install temporary withdraw limits. 
That would be a huge show of force for the YV.

But, if the French government actually needed to do that, it would send a strong message about just how strong that movement is.
I guess that's what they intent to achieve.

Pretty dumb to run the forum on the same domain as the exchange. The /forum route can see all the cookies (i.e. the session cookie) of the trading route.

Simply set a separate session ID on the domain after the user logged in. So after login, you get a session on the trading domain plus a different session on the forum domain. That way, if the forum is cracked, the stolen sessions can't be used on the trading domain.
