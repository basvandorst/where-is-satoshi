I like Rokabear.com because they accept BTC, instant setup, cheap prices, well known company, and I can pay monthly

Actually, pheeva backs up your encrypted wallet so if you lose your phone you can login to your account online and gain access to the wallet. However if you lose your wallet and PIN you cannot recover it because those are used to encrypt the wallet. So pheeva cannot access your wallet however they do store an encrypted backup

EVR NYC is a bar/restaurant on 39th and 6th. They have hosted tons of Bitcoin parties and the first bar to accept Bitcoin. They have been accepting since April 2013. The owners and investors are long time bitcoiners

I felt the same way when I bought in at $34 and a few hours later watching it climb further to $36 before crashing to $0.01. I sold alot of my coins on the crash and ended up buying back in on the way up. Moral: Bitcoin is a long term game, HOLD!

Hey, didn't I win the bid for 0.5? Was looking forward to buying this. Why did my bid fail?

Yup! We planning on Q1 of this year, now that most of the work is done

I appreciate the comment, but id rather not go to jail. Like I always say, many laws suck but we must follow them while we try and change them. I try and follow what ghandi did, called Satyagraha, which is "truth force," a particular philosophy and practice within the broader overall category generally known as nonviolent resistance or civil resistance.

Just made my deposit with BTC ! I'll do hourly rental for BTC in the NYC area if anyone's around :)

Yup! It's really nice !!

No one is trying to regulate Bitcoin. In fact, it's physically impossible to do so. It's like regulating air. However if we operate companies that handle millions of dollars, we must follow the law
