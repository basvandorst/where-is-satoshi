Negative, there is 2 possible methods of failure: forgeries and insufficient funds. The simpler one being Insuf. funds whomever has that simply owns the bank or gov. money.(they're not going to say "oh yeah I forged that, send me to jail")
And Forgery is countered with currency quality checks like 18 methods of determining validity, stripes on Benjamin's coat saying 100 usd etc.
and forgery of signature combatted with acceptees of a signature always watching the signature being signed, and in the event the previous signature before the one you are watching was forged; there is only 1 scenario this happens in the check was lost in the same way people lose traditional money(misplacement/robbery) basically you lose the check to lose the money. of course it would also have to match the original duplicate in the checkbook, and would have already been reported. So even if they're caught they probably going to perhaps even settle out of court.

You can definitely stamp metal A LOT cheaper than that.


That is why there is error recovery built into the QR spec. On the highest error recovery setting %30 can be scratched out without any loss of info.  Scratches are often not a problem in most circumstances for Qr codes.
This is what QR codes original purpose was getting car parts entire history of where that part has been. so they can determine the origin of a manufacturing error if several different machines were making identical parts and the part id was partially scratched they could still find which machine did the error and fix it quickly before any more broken parts were manufactured.
EVERY single part was tracked for less than fractions of a cent each. Most of the original qr codes stamped in 1994 by Mitsubishi or whichever company it was are still readable, and will be long after we're dead. Denzo Wave was the developer of the technology not the end user.

It may not be related directly to bitcoin, however as the title states it explains **non-directly** how the Fed is controlled by the banks; Implying bitcoin is superior.
I disagree with the idea bitcoin is superior in preventing corruption. The schedule of minting in bitcoin encourages hoarding as opposed to respiration. Cash/money/btc serves best as a lubricant of value, not as a store of it. Even though the dollar is going down in value, the dollar encourages investment in stocks(or else you lose value) bitcoin encourages investment in bitcoin.

miners roll the dice with idle cpu time to get a winning hash(a hash &lt; a certain number) of valid signed transactions into a blockchain to prevent people from re-spending the coins in their account. The more powerful hashing devices can roll more frequently increasing their odds of winning.
All coins have come from winners of the rolls, originally they had no value until someone gave them value(fractions of a penny) by buying a pizza in return for 10000 coins. Once it had value ppl begain to trade it and supply and demand took it's value up to what it is today.

Equity/Goods/Stocks/Skills are the things that have ***real value***.  
Cash/Bitcoin *Currency* is a value transfer commodity **not** something with ***actual value***.  
The main value of Currency is how immediately liquidable it is, not it's actual value; it has value because *we give it value*.
You have this right to give it value, just the early adopters ***gave it value*** by purchasing pizza for someone, they gave it value(1/10,000 of a pizza/ per coin).  
Impatience(or *Demand*) is what brought the value up anything above that, people willing to pay some small % more in exchange to have their coins sooner.
I would invest no more than %5, in combined cryptocurrencies. I think BTC is the Napster of Cryptocurrencies it is a clear Pioneering Technology but will eventually be replaced by something else.
