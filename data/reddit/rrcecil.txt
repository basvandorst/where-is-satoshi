Thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:27:58
What is that?
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:02:27
do you want to talk in dollars then convert?
@_date: 2013-06-25 12:51:02
I was joking, I should have added a little more hint at that. My apologies.
@_date: 2013-07-07 18:43:57
Thank you, I was hoping more to buy it used (I'm in college = not much money)
@_date: 2013-04-05 07:08:55
Yes, using Bitcoin to invest in companies or even the development the community. I saw something where you could invest in SD but lost the link.
@_date: 2013-02-25 13:36:59
Okay, so maybe I'm coming at it from a wrong angle. Shouldn't I wait for somewhat of a drop? Just curious, I've been forging the way in my family for bitcoin and I'm nervous to take the big step. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:55:20
My problem is I make it feel like stocks, when I know it isn't. I need to drop money on it more.

Like any great Lord, Nakamoto gave birth to many bastards. One loathed in his father's shadow, seeking the riches that his father had been rewarded, he sought to create his own guild... His name... Jon Coin, the Bastard Nakamoto.

Yes, I meant cash. I have 1k cash in my safe in my room. I wanted to wait to see if the dollar gained any value before I converted it.
@_date: 2013-02-25 13:41:16
Thanks for the response, I will be sure to tip when I do the exchange. Thanks!

IT support my friend, IT support.

Why don't we make a crew and start something? Like Bandcamp or Napster or iTunes but Bitcoin optimize it. There could be a lot of potential. Hear me out:
1. Great way to be heard
2. What name doesn't sound great with "bit" in it
  - Bitstruments, Bitmusic, hell I'm getting sweaty thinking     about it.
3. Why stop at music, it could be a multi-bit-art market discovery area.
4. With commission, we could sponsor promising musicians.
I don't know, maybe I'm crazy, but I have a decent Web Dev skill set and some bitcoins sitting around. PM me if your interested.

Oh god, embarrassing, clicked on the wrong sub
@_date: 2013-06-25 12:32:46
Looking at the post now, that would be better put under goals. It is very difficult. But having that as a goal from the get-go.
@_date: 2013-02-21 21:22:37
How could I help? Where would I start? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:54:46
I feel so bad for everyone that bought that, I really hope they deliver.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:14:13
Okay, I don't see why trying to help people makes me delusional? 
Everything you are saying is completely understandable , I don't understand the hostility though.
This isn't short term "donate to Africa omg!!1 like ths status" it's long term, I'm not personally going to Kenyan banks and begging them to switch to Bitcoin, it's about getting them involved and helping them find a way to use it. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:57:26
Wow, great input! Reddit comes up with such great ideas. :D
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:05:22
If you use Bitcoin, you know sooner or later it will stabilize. The whole thing isn't promising them "2 bread" it a way to help them move past their extremely inflated currency. No ones life is depending on it, it is simply going to be an extremely handy tool.
@_date: 2013-02-21 16:03:03
That was what I meant, I want it to drop before I buy. Then just leave it be for the long term. I wasn't intending to use that money right away.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:07:39
Any advice on where to post this elsewhere? I want to find others interested!
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:24:45
Go to blockchain.info 
You can back it up with Dropbox, Google Drive, etc,...
It gets shit for some reason on this subreddit but if you look at how it is run and how safe it ACTUALLY is then you will know you are fine. The interface is beautiful too.
Been using it for months, not complaints.
@_date: 2013-06-25 12:51:23
It definitely would grow over time
@_date: 2013-04-02 22:06:25
He would be uninterested in Reddit unfortunately. He is a computer whiz for someone his age. He is one of those people that don't get social media though.

@_date: 2013-04-25 06:59:18
mturk but in Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:27:30
Bro, or bro-ette,
It is still in its infancy. I wouldn't invest anything you aren't willing to lose, but it is estimated to be $1000 and I'd bet on it. They said it wouldn't reach 100... Well...
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:22:23
It could be like classes almost, like this years class went to x and raised x amount of BTC and helped x amount of people, sponsor class of 2014. It would be so internet friendly.
@_date: 2013-04-30 07:52:57
Where is your link to donate? Where is your website? C'mon man, we all want this to happen but just explaining it wont do much.
@_date: 2013-02-21 17:08:50
You would be in space right now if you did friend
@_date: 2013-05-01 17:39:40
American here, living in Europe, how can I help?
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:04:27
I sure hope so, for your sake man.
@_date: 2013-06-25 11:50:10
Just Bollywood...
No I'd want to make as appealing as possible, so people can binge watch like I tend to do.
