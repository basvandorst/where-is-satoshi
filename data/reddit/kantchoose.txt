When satoshi set up bitcoin the original intent was a peer to peer thing like bittorrent, we handed the mining part of the p2p to "miners" as he asked everyone to not use graphics cards to mine and now we are right back to "well can we trust the organizations that control our financial system". 
maybe next time someone invents a p2p money system people can fight a little harder to keep it p2p!

This feels like an article written by a person who has never actually traveled and hopes the reader hasn't either. Credit cards can be used most places and it's simple to get one with absolutely no international fee, and when you do need an ATM the 1-3 dollars to use an atm might be true if you don't have a bank that has branches in that country but the 3-4% charge is something they made up out of thin air and is not a thing I've seen ever. I've seen bitcoin ATMs with 10% markups however.

Bitcoin could absolutely not do it differently. Only ~ 260,000 people can use bitcoin in a day once a day. The whole blockchain debate may raise that number 20x but still leave it just a 5 million something at best. Bitcoin is absolutely totally unsuitable for frequent payments of any sort.

Millions of wire transfers happen a day, if they were on the blockchain it'd take months to process them all. It's easy to be fast when barely anything uses something and they can get the full channel like in bitcoin, but with banks it's not taking 3 days to process your one transfer, it's to process 20 million transfers.

That is nonsense though, that is not how allocating a limited resource works. 25 dollars is not very much of most people's total wealth but literally no one would allocate 25 dollars to a thumb tack or a taco bell taco. Someone having 10,000gb doesn't mean they stop caring how they use 100 of them. 
my life span is hopefully many many many thousands of hours left, but that doesn't mean a movie that is 5 hours long is going to be something I want to engage with just based on it not taking a large percentage of the total. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:05:01
Even if the block size was a million gb fees would still seem random and arbitrary to a non savvy user. For example sending a dollar costs a different amount if you acquired that dollar as a dollar or as a bunch of pennies since combining many inputs will make a larger KB file. Likewise money that is older is cheaper to send than money that is newer. All sensible rules to prevent spam but all translating to "the fee is a random number as far as most people care".

That simply is true, you are living in a delusion if you think shitty software can bloat to whatever size it wants solely because hard disks have grown.
