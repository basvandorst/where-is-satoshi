Sorry - Probably a bit too strong of tone there by me. I don’t hate the movement exactly but I hate what seems like a string of actions that spurred from that. Specifically I don’t like the way it was done and I don’t like what looks like misleading positioning by Roger Ver, bitcoin.com, etc. leading to more confusion for new folks than anything.  If others want a new direction via fork I’m fine with that but arguing that it’s the “real bitcoin” just adds to confusion. I’d rather folks start a new coin on its own merits vs take an existing leader and fork it creating market cap out of nowhere. I think if that continues it will dilute crypto as a whole eventually. 
But having said all that, I’m also frustrated that the “core” developers also resisted larger blocks on principle as a short term fix while segwit, Lightning etc were being worked on for the longer term. 
Truthfully I’m being naive wishing all sides would quit being stubborn to their principles and focus on the bigger war (vs the established fiats/banks). 
Ultimate the market will decide and I’m fine with that. I just hope some crypto wins in the end ...

I used the recommendation from bread wallet. In retrospect I now know it’s too low but to late to do anything easy to fix it which adds to the frustration.

First mover advantage I suppose and ultimately the hashpower of the network (measured by capital invested and power consumed) directly relates to security and immutability of transaction history. So from that perspective bitcoin has a big advantage still as store of value that will be hard to break. But I don’t disagree otherwise and why I personally am using other coins more and more for transactions.

About 80%+ of gold mined goes to store of value (coins, bar, central banks,etc). Less than 20% for the actual industrial use.

So cool!

The only commonality is that they are both brilliant but coming from different angles (software vs economics).

Very cool. I'm in palm beach county with a small but growing mining operation. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:38:11
Exactly. I’m growing tired of claims of smaller chips that don’t actually deliver the step change in performance they should. Makes me question the claims... feels like Halong all over again. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 20:30:08
Maybe to a degree actually. But I more likely think it’s exaggerated marketing. Like maybe the the control board has a 7 mm chip but the hashing chips aren’t... lol

No it’s not when there is a true chip nm breakthrough. Even the first gen should be a significant gain in efficiency. Or it’s really not a 7nm I real terms. Or we are running up against real Moore’s law limits/tangential behavior. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 01:17:19
This is awesome 
@_date: 2018-06-06 00:32:17
The S9 was 2.5 times more efficient than the S7. That was a true chip nm breakthrough. 20% is way too small of an improvement. 
I realize all this is speculation until we see real performance anyway. I’m just saying the quoted specs don’t back up that it’s a new breakthrough smaller nm chip design.

So then by that definition I assume you also don’t consider “invest” appropriate for Tesla stock or many other of the highest market cap stocks which have never paid dividends?
I’ve heard this argument much but seems like it’s quite a double standard.

Why call the title of your video “the math behind mcaffe’s bitcoin target” when you don’t actually explain his math at all. Clickbait title. :(
@_date: 2019-04-18 03:50:11
Ok. Fair enough. I heard that in the video. But the title implied you were going to explain mcafee’s math behind his prediction. You just did some other math to counter his prediction but you didn’t reveal his math. And how do you get 3 billion users from 20000%?
@_date: 2019-04-23 03:23:21
Indeed. But it only updates approximately every 2 weeks for bitcoin specifically
@_date: 2019-04-18 03:56:16
Ok. I’ll take a look. Good luck with it. :)
@_date: 2018-11-08 14:51:08
Agree. I’ve ordered ~40 miners from Bitmain over the last couple years and they deliver on time and sometimes early. And the quality has been good and the few I’ve had problems with they resolved. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 00:10:57
Love it. You got me. Already panic sold everything 
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:28:41
Bitmain psus don't come with a power cable. So what cable are you talking about? 
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:23:03
So then why are they no more efficient? (Maybe minimally more efficient but not what I was anticipating for the next gen chip)
@_date: 2019-05-08 23:00:46
Great interview!
@_date: 2019-05-01 22:33:32
This is great for bitcoin and crypto. Any type of professional looking exposure and options are good if you want increases mainstream interest and adoption. All of you who are snubbing your nose because this isn’t your version of “pureness” of crypto are missing the point of what mainstream  adoption is.
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:52:39
Super cool!

Why are you posting an article from more than a month ago?
@_date: 2019-05-06 11:13:22
Love the “plagued with fraud” paragraph Bloomberg added in there that was totally out of context and had nothing to do with Fidelity’s news. The editor must have said “bitcoin article that is positive? Add our obligatory FUD paragraph and oh yea add it to the title of the article too.”
