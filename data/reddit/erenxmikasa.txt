I'm using Electrum, and I've tried giving them the change address as well as some of the recieving addresses, none seem to work

It asked for my existing wallet's seed
@_date: 2014-09-25 18:46:20
No, should I do that? I was able to send money to it yesterday without a problem (3$)
@_date: 2014-09-24 12:35:29
:O, holy crap thank you thank you thank you thank you so much!
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:57:33
I did as you instructed me and now I have the bitcoins in my wallet :) Thanks!

They got the money from localbitcoins.com
This is what they're getting: 
Also I'm using Electrum and I've tried on 2 different wallets.

I applied for an invite :)
@_date: 2014-09-25 04:22:59
Yes it would, I only have 2.5$ right now.

All right, thanks :)
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:34:04
Hmm yes, how can I exactly do that? :D
Do I create a new wallet in Electrum?
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:54:37
I added the private key, I now have the money in my Electrum wallet! Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:20:38
Is there any way I can access the money now?
EDIT: Also can you send me a link to that bootstrap torrent thing?
