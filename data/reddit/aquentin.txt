I think a compromise can be reached. Lightning on its own, with a tiny 1mb block, is in no way a solution. It would play with fundamental incentives and in the proseess have a real chance of killing bitcoin, decentralised or not. 
The blocksize on its own probably can not provide the full functionality either if we are imagining huge scales. 
We need both. We need to increase the blocksize far higher than it currently stands, in some gradual fashion as Gavin is proposing to some maybe 8GB in 20 years, thus giving everyone the time to code lightning, thoroughly test that no money can be lost and allow it to prove itself. 
Then it can be added on top and enhance bitcoin's functionality without risking the disruption of the nash equilibrium.

and how do they take these fees? Plus.. if in effect they have a monopoly in fees then how does anyone hold them accountable when the fees are too high etc
and... is there actually a proposed solution to transaction malleability?
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:00:19
Yes, but, Satoshi was wrong didn't you know? He wasn't in any way smarter than Peter Todd who knows a lot about this stuff and game theory, or nullc who thought that he could prove a negative with his "I proved decentralised consensus is impossible".
Plus, things have changed now, it's not like Satoshi said "it was all set in stone". 
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:51:20
so, if most of the fees go to hubs, then what would incentivise mining? 
Presumably you are not suggesting that paying 100k per on blockchain transaction is somehow a working system especially when a node for example would in no way require such huge investment...
Not to mention all the other complications with the underlying incentives.
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:35:03
Why exactly do we need sidechains? I hear they good to test features (isn't that what the testnet is for?)... but supposing a feature is found to be good and useful, then what? I suppose you could say then we can incorporate it into bitcoin... yet why aren't any good features shown by altcoins to be useful incorporated... such as... well exactly, what feature?
I'd like to make two points. Firstly, if we do find out that a feature is "good" are the blockstream developers giving a binding promise that they will lobby to incorporate this feature into bitcoin?
The second point, and I would like it to be refuted if possible, is that I personally see sidechains as an attempt to balkanise the blockchain. Many people here argue, perhaps rightly, that what Blythe Masters is trying to do, namely having what I call "private blockchains", makes no sense. I digress. 
Bitcoin is a concept, an idea. A genius invention which made possible the unforgability and uncopiness of data as well as other qualities. To prohibit others from copying a certain thing one needs not a global network necessarily. Bitcoin, or rather the blockchain, can just as well do its function at a national, local, and, more importantly, employee level. 
I am not smart enough to imagine the applications of a blockchain at an employee level. That being only, say, JP Morgan employees can run a node or mine some unique and unforgable or uncopiable data for whatever reason they wish. 
Others are, however, and this is what Blythe Masters is trying to do and in my opinion this is what sidechains do. They provide the opportunity for private companies to run their own localised and private blockchains. For them to do so of course they will need to hire the blockstream devs to design the system, thus the for profit part, thus what they mean by "consulting fees". 
I do not think there is much wrong with this idea prima facie. Some analogy, for example, may be running a website (a private blockchain) over tcp/ip (bitcoin for clarity or THE blockchain). However, in my view, that's a false analogy.
As many may remember, the internet came to most through AOL which was in its early days a walled garden or private as I may call it. Then the open internet unleashed its power, breaking down gardens and barriers. Sidechains are or can be the opposite. While we currently have the open blockchain, they threaten to be the AOL of bitcoin and balkanise the blockchain and decimate it into walled gardens run by private companies.
I would like to be refuted in what follows, but I have throughout the blocksize debate assumed utmost honesty and good will towards wishing bitcoin itself and THE blockchain to succeed. However, when someone like Luke-Jr suggests that taking consulting fees to, in effect, sell sidechains which leads to balkanizing the blockchain, "would make sense", I can not help but be utterly disgusted at the idea that competition is coming from within, not from without as Blythe Masters might represent. 
And to further suggest that we must keep the blocksize to 1mb while potentially selling sidechains  with 20mb capacity or whatever feature your corporate masters want has somehow to do with centralisation or transaction fees sounds to me as an attempt to cripple this global ledger and make your consulting service that much more competitive. For one, and I might say, one reason alone.
If currently HP or Microsoft or Goldman Sachs or the Fed or Ecuador seeks the advice of the community to their suggestion that they should run a private, walled gardened blockchain, we have a perfect answer which any for profit motivated entity can not possibly ignore, and the answer goes something like this.
Sure, you could, but why would you? Your private blockchain would be weak in hashpower, thus potentially attacked in a decisively devastating manner, leading to untold losses. There is no reason why you can't use bitcoin, it's super cheap, it can do all you want pseudoanonymously if not entirely anonymously, it is quick, fast and utterly secured and, it is still a somewhat new thing. There are thousands of developers working on it, refining it everyday, coming up with brilliant ideas to make it better. All of that is yours for free, why would you spend billions on developers, energy, hashing, nodes whatever, when you can just use this.
If, however, bitcoin and with it this global blockchain is crippled by very high fees, as nullc and the rest of the blockstream suggests we should do, utterly unintuitivley yet completely fail to give higher evidence that unintuitive suggestions demand, then there is little we can say to JP Morgan's idea of running his own private blockchain and compete with the crippledcoin. In fact, it would be stupid for them to not go on their own and create their own blockchain with their own nodes and hashpower since the potential savings from fees would demand it, while it would be utterly stupid of them to do so if we can maintain the blockchain as open as the internet and as cheap as it is. 
Yet nullc et al are arguing that we keep THE blockchain uncompetitive, that we increase the fees, that we limit transactions, that we turn away prospective customers, that we bar prospective new inventions of the use of the blockchain, that we, in short, kill this thing before it has legs so that they can sell their disgusting private walls and keep us locked within our cages when bitcoin stands for exactly the opposite and promises freedom, open accessibility, where anyone who wishes can take part, true free market in all its aspects, not walled gardens controlled by corporate masters.  
Still, I expect they do have good intentions, it is just that, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

It does. It makes them optional. From a certain point of view, capping the blockchain to 1mb and increasing some sidechain to 20mb is seen as a solution... it's in the lightning dev's talk. 
I can see some fundamental complications in regards to incentives however as far as the whole network is concerned which nullc or Adam Backs does not seem to have analysed, or at least not publicly. Bitcoin currently is in a nash equilibrium, add a disruptive variable and the equilibrium becomes unbalanced. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 13:26:33
It, however, fundamentally changes bitcoin's underlying incentives with unforseeable consequences for hash power security and mining.

Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions by the way. The SF presentation refers to a systemic attack which would lead to all coins in the lightning network be stolen. This can be minimized with full blocks, but the risk still remains. 
Do you think that such single point of failure with such drastic repercussions, even if the risks are very low, is in any way acceptable?

There is consensus. The supermajority, that is some 80% of users, businesses, miners, want a blocksize increase. 
Only a tiny minority objects and simply because they happen to have appointed themselves as core devs does not mean they decide consensus. And before you say, but technical knowledge, Gavin has technical knowledge, as does Satoshi... not to mention that they have stated no technical thing that persuades anyone to not increase the blocksize. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 09:15:07
Mining Pools are not one entity. They are made of countless of small miners who choose to run their hash there. If the miners disagree with the pool's policy, then they simply leave, as Ghash found out.

Who cares about what some site aimed at noobs says about hard forks. Noobs don't run nodes and no one will be persuaded by some biased policy which basically amounts to an abuse of power.

@_date: 2015-06-29 13:14:49
Why would anyone run a hub?
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:10:58
I am utterly perplexed that months into this debate we still have not heard any concrete objection from the "core devs" but a lot of speculation and subjective opinions instead. 
They speak of authority and technical knowledge, thus dismissing the "mere mortals", as if Satoshi or Gavin doesn't have the technical knowledge. Then they speak of Game Theory as if anyone can not see the games that Peter Todd et al. is playing, especially with his acceptance of payments by some shady John Dillon character with links to intelligence and with his replace by fee nonsense, an utter insanity at this point when miners are currently subsidised by millions a day and yet users are expected to, currently, pay fees on top? 
Anyway, plenty of words is nice, but there comes a time when every man and woman has to decide and  at a certain point debate must end and action be taken. 
So, "core devs", time to put your money where your mouth is and state your position: 
If the supermajority adopts bitcoinxt, will you be on board, will you leave bitcoin or something else?
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:09:43
It is nice to see Garzik actually contribute to this debate by offering a concrete proposal which some suggest might reach consensus.
It seems that, based on the presented arguments, some core devs remain concerned that increasing the blocksize would increase node centralisation. The argument goes something like... if it is not free to run and you have to pay $6 a month or so then people would not run a node. 
Yet almost no one runs a node as it is. Out of an estimated 3 million bitcoin users, only 6,000 entities do so. That is probably because to run a node is already inconvenient, especially when for most people there is no reason to transact from core in light of the many SPV clients. 
The only entities left that are running a node are miners, businesses, researchers and hobbyists who need to run a node for whatever reason, rather than individuals who can choose whether to run a node or not. 
The only way to increase the number of nodes therefore is to increase the number of entities which **need** to run a node. I don't see how the number of such entities can be increased under 1mb. In fact I can see it decrease. 
If we look at the lightning network, for example, it has its own security and resource requirements. Some entities which would be running a node would instead run a hub, thus dividing the "resources" between hubs and nodes which one would think would lead to a decrease of the number of nodes. 
On the other hand, if the blockchain was scaled, it can be used for more applications, thus it increases in value, thus the number of businesses increase, the number of miners who wish to invest in the infrastructure increase, all of which need to run a node, thus increasing the number of nodes. 
Therefore, I do not understand at all the argument that 20mb would increase node centralisation when it has the potential to do the opposite, but under 1mb I think we can be sure that the number of nodes will not increase, as the application of the blockchain is capped, and it might even decrease as resources are diverged towards other settlement layers.
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:54:59
So now that even miners have come out in favour of increasing the blocksize... it is a supermajority of users, businesses, miners, basically it is everyone vs 4 core devs.
Moreover, none of the core devs can argue that they have the technical expertise and everyone else just doesn't understand the issues. I am sure Gavin has just as much, if not more technical expertise, having had the vision to join so early and tirelessly work on bitcoin and I am sure Satoshi has the technical expertise and understands the issue dare I say better than everyone else. 
So what exactly is stopping this mythical consensus, or, much more correctly since we do have consensus, what exactly is stopping this core dev consensus?
If there is a concrete objection... then core devs please bring it forward. Otherwise please explain why exactly do you remain against and whether you would move on to XT if it does succeed or whether you will leave bitcoin. 
 
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:15:05
I wouldn't call emotional statements like "the community will commit suicide" as balanced and they both seem to imply that Satoshi's vision was wrong. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 21:10:50
None of the core devs seems to be against increasing the blocksize and jgarzik sounds to me like vocally being in favour.
Therefore, there is a core-dev consensus that we need to increase the blocksize, the question is a more trivial one of how much and... Gavin does not stand alone even amongst the core-devs, jgarzik seems to support him, in principle at least if not in all the details. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:45:16
No, I am referring to a sybil attack of the lightning network which, from a presentation the lightning devs gave, seems to allow a potential hacker to steal all the coins within the lightning network. I do not think that risk is in any way acceptable.
As far as economics, I think perhaps you should present some analysis with estimates of what this future would look like. As a draft thought my thinking is that if onchain transactions become high, say 1,000+, then although you can have insurance etc, it is unlikely that anyone would pay such fees in any significant numbers as far as mining revenue is concerned. The mining revenue therefore would depend on the hub's settlement transactions, who in turn have an interest to make as few transactions as possible so as to not pay the fees. I don't see how all these competing interests can be balanced to provide the needed revenue for miners to secure the network.
On the other hand, if the blockchain, which has been tested and has proven itself over the past years, accommodates these transactions the fees would go to miners directly, thus increasing mining competition and decentralisation and we wouldn't add a further potentially destabilising variance into the equation.
That's, of course, in regards to a 1mb cap. If the cap was far higher so that, say, 100 million people can transact on the blockchain, then the incentives could far more easily be balanced.
So, in my opinion, the answer as always is somewhere in the middle. Increase the cap considerably at this stage in a gradual fashion somewhere to ,maybe, 8gb in 20 years, and at the same time code lightning, test it thoroughly, and add it on top once it proves itself.
Don't you think that's far more reasonable in achieving full scalability while balancing all the myriad considerations?
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:38:41
I'm quite interested to hear on what the problem is with increasing the blocksize? The only two I have heard is node centralisation... which my recent comment, I believe, fully addresses ( and imposing an arbitrary cap to create fee market which to most sounds ludicrous. So what exactly is the problem with bigger blocks? 
As for hardforking... unfortunately we are in a situation, after months of debate, when most devs have given their opinion and specified their objections... none of which sound particularly technical... and still the super-majority of businesses, users, and now even the majority of miners have come in favour, while some core devs remain against without presenting any persuasive argument.
The risks of such a hard fork therefore would be created by a tiny minority which seems to not bulge from it's position even when the majority has given ground time and again. I don't think we can be held hostage by them for no good reason whatever.
If it was different, say a real reason as to why not to increase the blocksize was presented, something that was logical and made sense, then matters would have been different. But unpersuasive objection... and then arguing that others should nonetheless listen to you ( I don't mean you personally) and put up with it even though they clearly do not wish to... leaves us with no choice.
The core devs should reconsider their position, including in their reconsideration the risks of a non-dev-consesus hardfork, which the supermajority seems to support, rather than doubling down even though it is clear that their arguments have little merit. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:19:14

@_date: 2015-06-19 15:55:39
It's a pool and the pool does run on credibility since the miners can take their hash elsewhere. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:23:36
Gavin has written a number of blog posts to address all concerns. If there is something concrete, then I am sure everyone would like you to specify it and detail it so that it can be known and addressed.
General statements such as "pretty negative", "huge negative impact", etc, and then brushing off the request for details with what amounts to, I don't have the time to deal with all this, doesn't really contribute much to the debate.
I, of course, don't mean some peer reviewed article. I mean... provide details to specific concerns, the bugs, how it breaks anything, etc, preferably to Gavin so that he can address them, unless you have already done so or you don't think there is much use to doing so.

Lol. I haven't received a PM, but I don't assume it is somehow [censored] ahaha.
The point I am making is somewhat simple. Bitcointalk is a rubbish way to communicate on the internet in the 21st century, although it is still quite useful and I read it from time to time because it has its own advantages. 
Reddit is better because the veris in numeris can, through their wisdom, get the better posts to the top and drown the worser ones. But, reddit is controlled by some sort of corporation which is concerned with numerous subreddits and r/bitcoin is just one of many to them, so they might not care.
It is far better to have an r/bitcoin, but independent and not reliant on any third party as it currently is, so that if those smart kids who are in control see any sock puppet manipulating, they don't have to beg the admins to do something about it.
That's what ycombinator.com is and they are doing a damn good job of fostering a civilised conversation around their topic of interest - silicon valley start ups. I don't have the funds or wizznes, but a copy and paste ycombinator where some bitcoiners who truly care about the currency are in control, I'd think, is far better than this "home" where we are at the mercy of disinterested third parties.

That post talks about everything except for the question up to debate: what is wrong with increasing the blocksize?
He jumps instead to the risk of non-consensus hardfork, while completely ignoring the reason why there is such non-consensus. 
No one is bent on having a hardfork. Some core devs however are bent on not analysing the issues in question in a logical, maths based manner, but simply refuse and instead focus on authority...
If we are to speak of authority, technical expertice, phds in comp science etc, as much respect as I have for Adam Backs for his huge contribution to bitcoin through hashcash, I must nonetheless say, with all due respect, that he did not have the vision to create bitcoin. That genius was Satoshi, who I am sure Adam would agree has both the authority and the technical expertise, and he suggested the exact proposal made by Gavin.
Why not therefore clearly, in a concrete, detailed, computer science manner, with maths, logic and analysis state your reasons for creating this apparent lack of consensus, instead of arguing about risks that you yourself and other core devs are causing?

"According to the lawyer, they found it on the 7th of this month by searching through the "wallet" being used by MtGox prior to 2011 June."
And the google translate: "According to the lawyers of the company, the 7th of this month, the company was using previously in June 2011, and found the place of examination of the storage location on the net called "Wallet""
So they were searching through the 2011 blockchain addresses and found these coins resting there, exactly as stated in the thread on the 28th of February. They didn't even know the coins existed, but we knew! Lmao; utter bullshit. He is lying through his teeth and slowly will begin finding coins everywhere.

@_date: 2014-06-13 16:59:27
If you are transferring 10k btc I see no problem with waiting an hour or more.
If it is just 100 btc though 6 confirmations is fine because ghash is not going to bankrupt itself over 100 btc and if they try it would only happen once, and for like a coffee, even 0 confirmations, in my opinion, is fine because it costs more to try and double spend that satoshi than the double spent satoshis themself.

I am not so sure. The announcement seems to be timed in relation to Lawsky's. New York and London are in a fierce competition over the title of the financial capital of the world. One year it goes to New York, another to London. So I expect any regulation coming from London to be far, far less draconian than what New York proposed. 
If nothing else, the two world financial centers competing with each other over bitcoin businesses can only mean a trend towards less and less bitcoin regulations.
This is the best news for Bitcoin in its 5 years history. The Chancellor has a far more important role and reputation in UK than other comparable positions and this is really like Obama buying btc.

Also, we pay for the lawyers, the prosecution, the investigation, we pay for everything. 10 milion is not a set amount. That is the minimum. There are lawyers costs on top of that, the "investigation" and/or the "prosecution" might cost more than ten million. Plus, sunlot keeps 10% - according to the terms - not the person that finds the coins. 
Furthermore, Jed, Gonzagues and Sunlot are released from any responsibility whatever. So we have to cross our fingers and hope that Jed, the GayButcher or Sunlot did not steal the coins.

Roger you are totally right on the need to publicise the bitcoin addresses. That would help more than most things.

You know how prosecution can prove it in front of a jury of peers? Very simple. Ladies and Gentlemen, thousands of people sent coins to addresses this man controls, yet he refuses to return the coins to these individuals or provide any evidence whatever of where the coins went.
If you were a member of the jury, what would you conclude? I'd say guilty!
That's in regards to this very specific point above though, I don't necessarily think he stole them etc, but there is no evidence and when there is no evidence that means only one thing, the person who was last known to have the coins still has them until he proves otherwise. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:25:09
Because he can be selling them and once sold deposit more. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 20:45:37
Keep being pedantic mate.....
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:13:20
There are only three options: Gox/Jed or the Thief.
Neither of those three should be selling these coins right now. 
In regards to Gox or the theif it is obvious why they should not be selling them. In regards to Jed, those coins moved on the 6th of February, one day before gox stopped withdrawals. There is suspicion therefore that even if these are Jed's coins they might have been on mtgox before he moved them on the 6th. If that was the case he would have been given unfair advantage. The law therefore would nullify that transaction and distribute these coins equally amongst all creditors. 
That might not be the case of course, if they are jed's coins at all rather than gox's or theif's, but it needs to be investigated before they can be sold. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:31:31
What's the risk? Just increase the number of confirmations for huge transactions. The usual 6 is fine for normal transactions because it would make no sense for anyone to double spend some low amount and even if they do its no biggy, but no one would want to go bankrupt so that they can double spending 10btc lol

@_date: 2014-06-13 17:03:46
There's two aspects here - theory and practice. If the attacker keeps 51% forever, then of course he can go back to even the genesis block and at some point in some years will overtake the public chain,
but in practice any such attack is unlikely to be ahead of the public chain for more than a few minutes, an hour or at the very best a day as all miners withdraw their hash from that pool. So they can only double spend once and then be sent to oblivion by miners who boycot them etc
@_date: 2014-03-20 19:09:54
Yeah. We'll have to wait and see what the court doc says exactly. If MK is now coming out and saying he had lost keys, he is basically admitting that he lied to the court as he said the coins were lost to hackers. For some reason I do not think he would do that.

This is huge news. It sounds like Overstock is looking to develop Bitcoin's inbuilt smart contract system which has so far been neglected.
Bitcoin has an inbuilt core system created by Satoshi which allows for the coding of the way a bitcoin can be spent, stored etc, basically etherum, but much better cus Satoshi. It can be used to issue stocks or for self executed contracts or for countless of other applications.
Overstock now seems to be gathering a team to focus specifically on developing this far reaching feature by using bitcoins and the Bitcoin protocol which means that the full potential of bitcoin can be reached.

Less certain about the linked address than the other ones, but pretty certain about this one:
Most of the funding to this address comes from this address:

@_date: 2014-05-24 11:10:58
Thankfully, bitcoin doesn't have a board with which Satoshi can disagree or have an infight. So if he ever intends to sell he most probably will do so in a way that maximises the value of his oldings - thus by association our holdings.

In a criminal case you need to reach the standard of beyond reasonable doubt. That is a technical term which differs from the layman's on the face understanding of what beyond reasonable doubt means. It basically means, are you sure of it. Obviously some doubt will remain, but when you clearly think of x, do you think that x is highly likely.
Now in regards to gox there were some coins that could be proven beyond reasonable doubt and they were so announced before mt gox filed for bankruptcy. There are other coins however which do not meet the beyond reasonable doubt standard. Some of them are pretty close to it, some of them are quite far off.
So it isn't a question of people have not found the coins, but a question of people are not sure enough yet that they have found them.

Well exactly. We can't prove a negative - that is that mtgox does not have the coins - so it is for MK to prove that either he does have the coins or that the coins were stolen.
That he has given no evidence whatever in regards to the coins does raise suspicions that he is lying because there is no reason for this evidence to not be provided. Publishing the cold wallets for example would in no way interfere with any investigation, so his failure to do so is suspicious. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 20:51:38

We can't prove a negative. That is, we can't prove MK does not have the coins and therefore did not steal them. It is for MK to prove that the coins we gave him are no longer in his position.
I don't necessarily think he stole them, but I think that he has been saying much, but has given no evidence whatever in regards to anything whatever. 
He was the last person with the coins. If he is claiming that he no longer possesses them then he needs to provide evidence of it.

"After the transaction malleability issue, which emptied the hot wallet, for the first time Karpeles had to retrieve coins from the cold storage.
But the cold coins are stored using a custom bitcoin implementation he "forgot how it works"."
Karpels allegedly forgot how the php code works, not how to access his cold storage. According to this pastebin the problem was that gox wallets were being hacked and somehow all these 6 competent programmers couldn't fix the problem. They couldnt fix the problem because only karpels knew how the php code works.
The pastebin is dated 5th of Febuary. Withdrawals continued for another 2 days. Why would anyone allow withdrawals to continue if coins are being stolen? Why did this pachi guy resign? Why wasnt karpels communicating to these 6 programmers? 
Its clear. Karpels was lying to his own programmers just as he has been lying to us. 850k btc dissapeared he said, yet somehow we found 200k btc right there, 150k btc moved just before, 100k btc here and there, so 850k btc have dissapeared but we found more than half of them.
Question is, why is he lying?
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:03:58
Satoshi designed the whole thing and knows the protocol better than anyone else. If he thought that it needs to be 10 minutes then there is probably a very good reason for that. So if you wantto argue that it should be changed, you firstly need to identify satoshi's reason fo hos decision and then argue against it.

They might be Jed's coins, but they moved on the 6th of February, one day before withdrawals stopped. This raises some suspicion that Jed may have moved them from an mtgox address, in which case the coins should be distributed equally to all gox creditors as it would have been unfair advantage. Therefore these coins should not be sold before an investigation or an explanation.

MTGox wasn't just a facade, an illusion, real bitcoins and real money went there. Almost a million bitcoins were deposited to mtgox and people have matched the database deposits to the blockchain.

At least you do not need to cut thousands of trees to create paper money, use huge firepower to melt metal into coins, use huge plastic which constantly needs to be replaced in credit and debit cards and use huge electricity to manage huge computer data centres that control the transfer of fiat virtual money.
Bitcoin is way more environmentally friendly than fiat even in a direct comparison. If we are to include indirect comparisons as well by analysing the effects on the environment of a deflationary currency as opposed to fantasy out of thin air based on nothing whatever fiat money then Bitcoin is incredibly more environmentally friendly than fiat.

I don't think he understands how bitcoin works. No one "coins" a bitcoin - there is no "minting".
To appeal to the constitution in regards to money, in any event, is utterly futile. The Congress does not "mint" or "coin" in today's world. I believe that is the Fed - a quasi private public institution.
More importantly, the US constitution clearly states that only gold and silver can be legal tender.
If, therefore, we are to appeal to the constitution, we can not escape the conclusion that the US Dollar is illegal.
Seeing as the US dollar accounts for almost all transactions, we perhaps need to fix its illegality first before worrying in any way about "minting" or "coining" bitcoins.

Nice, we full circle. Not sure if you trolling or not, but, for a final time:
CC payments and debit card payments put you at risk of identity theft because they reveal private information about you which in combination with other information can cause to your identity being stolen. 
How  - I don't know and don't want to know, but its common sense, if private information which only you know are known by someone who wants to steal your identity, then the identity theft is likely to be more successful by them knowing these private information than not knowing them.
With bitcoin there is no such risk.

Well, I used hackernews as some sort of shortcut to say a reddit style portal but hosted on its own servers and where the mods have full control and don't need any admin permission. 
Another reddit sub would suffer from the same thing, you need admin permission for a lot of things.
You can instead have a website where people like here can up vote or down vote and then you can add whatever other rule you think is useful such as pointing out new accounts maybe or colouring differently accounts constantly downvoted etc. 
So, yeh some bits of hacker news might not be great. My point was, a space with upvotes and downvotes, but where you have total control of all aspects and need no third party's - i.e admin or sysadmin - permission.

I don't know what you use a bank for, but the main reason I use a bank is for my income to be deposited and to withdraw my income. I think banks lend this income when not in use without my permission. The risk of trusting them to give me my money is then subsidised by everybody ala 2007-2008. 
I should have an easy and convenient choice of not using a bank at all.
Thus, I have my own bank - a bitcoin address - which for all purposes can be as convenient as a bank account. My Income goes there, I can spent it etc. If some of that income is surplus, I can give it to a company to invest in stocks, or to invest in business startups or other companies, or mortgages, etc. I choose thus what exactly happens to my money and through this choice keep those who I give my money to accountable.
There is no choice as of right now in regards to a bank account. The not having a bank account is not a choice per se, more of something unfortunate.

That's not "just" a justices opinion. That was a Supreme Court case which ruled that the Dollar was unconstitutional. The US President then replaced the justices and the new court then ruled it constitutional.
Point being of course that the US constitution had a clear intention of making only gold and silver legal tender, but political machination perverted the spirit and wording of the constitution.
So it isn't incorrect to say what I said. Not least because the Federal Government has no authority in relation to money in the constitution and unlike legal persons the government can only do what the law gives it the authority to do.

The focus of this analysis are two addresses. The first address is: 
I will call this the 400k address or just 400k
The second address is:
I will call this the 432k address or just 432k
If the withdrawals of the 432k address are even briefly analysed it can be seen that it is broken into chunks of 50k which then go on to fund the proof transaction of 424k. There is no doubt therefore that the 432k address belongs to MT Gox. 
The 400k address has two transactions on the 27th of January 2011, one for 250k and another for 150k. 85k, withdrawn from the 250k, ends up funding the 432k address. Around 50k from the 250k address, chunked of course, are still there. 
There is more direct proof however that the 400k address belongs to Mt Gox: 
The donation address specified on this website goes on to fund the 150k address deep into its chunking. Furthermore, it connects directly with many of the addresses moved. 
On the 27th of January 2011, 150k was withdrawn from the 400k address. This 150k is divided into chunks of £5k, then 2k. This happened between the 1st and the 2nd of March 2011. The divided chunks never moved further. They stayed at the address they were sent in March 2011 until they were moved by only one withdrawal, part of them on 21st of December 2013 and part of them on the 5th-6th of February 2014 and remain there. All, that is, except for the last 5k which goes on to fund the 432k.
All of this 150k, albeit divided into smaller chunks, was moved, whether by the owner or the thief, just before the formal announcement by Mt Gox that withdrawals were halted.
It is possible that this 150k was retained by Jed McCaleb, the previous owner of Mt Gox, when he sold the company on or around March the 6th 2011. If that is the case then why did he move these ancient coins all at the same time?
There is evidence to suggest that these coins were not retained in ownership by Jed. There is one interesting address which comes up time and again: 1LXc28hWx1t8np5sCAb2EaNFqPwqJCuERD
The funding to this address comes mostly from the 150k, or is linked in this closed loop of addresses, which clearly can be seen from two or three 5k addresses. However, some of the addresses that immediately fund the 1LX are created after ownership of Mt Gox changed on March the 6th 2011. That does not preclude Jed himself creating these addresses at a later date than March the 2nd. It seems however more likely that Mt Gox owned these addresses as once ownership was changed then all the deposits would have had to be handed over to Mt Gox in order for Mt Gox to continue functioning as normal. 
In any event, whether the thief moved them or Jed, this 150k – and there is more in addresses created on 28 February 2011 and moved on 21 December 2013 – belong to Mt Gox. 
**Edit:** Yet no evidence whatever of Transaction Malleability ("TM") on the blockchain. Furthermore, it seems that Mark was aware of TM in October 2011 and had apparently either lost or spent a week's btc income on this problem: 
&lt;MagicalTux&gt; that's a problem, but not the worst problem we ever faced
&lt;MagicalTux&gt; all the broken withdraws have been re-issued
&lt;MagicalTux&gt; just spent one week of BTC-only income
Which strongly suggests that he would have solved the problem considering how much it had cost him.

The bitcointalk post states that 2k  from this address know to belong to DPR:  ends up at the 1933 address. 
That is true, but that could have very well been a deposit. 
This is the first deposit to 1933:
When I did a lot of looking around there were quite a few connections between gox addresses and this address. Some of them fairly direct. 
Now that they have moved just an hour or so after Mark Karpels woke up and with everything going on yesterday with the 200k I think it is very likely this is a gox address.

The most rational way of assessing the worth of each coin, and in my opinion the way the court is likely to follow, is the market worth of a coin at the time that withdrawals were suspended. So, about 650.
It wouldn't be the worth at the time of the bankruptcy because that is not when the coins were lost. They were lost when withdrawals were stopped.

There's only one hoop. From Gox/Jed/Thief to unknown address then Bitstamp. 
The first address to the second address was a movement of 150k - 300k coins on the 21st of December and the 6th of February. Therefore the movement from 1PNNF -&gt; 1JFXQ and 14MiN -&gt; 1HsUP was either by gox, Jed, or the theif. See: 
So there is only one hoop, 1DJoA and 1KnPn. These may even be bitstamp addresses, but even if this person/persons or business is someone who has no connection whatever with the theif/gox/jed he can shed some light on how he came to possess these coins. 
It is quite interesting though that both those addresses connect to bitstamp through only one hoop, and both sums were sent from this one intermediary address to bitstamp on the same day suggesting that the one hoop address may not be an innocent bystander.

5) Peter Vessenes has had a nine month conflict of interest regarding Mt. Gox given that his company CoinLab was involved in an active multi-million dollar lawsuit against Mark Karpeles and Mt. Gox, following a failed partnership.  Both men remained on the board of directors, and the Foundation failed to draft adequate by-laws that would allow them to address situations such as this where directors had material conflicts, which would compromise their ability to act in the best interests of its members. 
but perhaps most crucially
2) There is evidence that Bitcoin Foundation board members may have had direct access to Mark Karpeles which allowed them to personally deposit and withdraw funds from Mt. Gox, despite persistent delays for other customers.

I don't think that is the case already. Requiring approval to see if you can meet the requirements specified in the bitlicense is quite different from requiring approval for every little action that one does. The first aspect is perfectly in line with that legal principle. The latter is very much against it and, as any legal scholar will tell you, turning that fundamental legal principle on it's head is very much totalitarianism. 
They can very well define the many ways a company can be dishonest or irresponsible by simply stating that "you must not be dishonest or irresponsible upon a fine of whatever." The many cases and laws have defined what those two words mean perfectly well.

Problem is, chargebacks are often used fraudulently by customers, increasing the cost of transactions for everyone. One party to a deal shouldn't be able to unilaterally decide the action that is to be taken in the event of a breach of contract - which is what the examples you give below boil down to. 
There should be arbitration companies that decide, but even more conveniently, Bitcoin has a script system which allows for smart contracts. Unfortunately it is not currently used, but once it is developed a transaction can so be set up that both parties must perform their action, otherwise the bitcoins aren't spent, thus making chargebacks useless.

The bloksize debate to me reads like a clash between two visions. On the one hand we have those who believe that everything should be done on-chain if possible so that the full benefits of bitcoin can be enjoyed - trustless, quick, cheap, no one can tell me what to do with my money, how I spend it, where, when, with who. Cash, basically. 
On the other hand we have this vision where the blockchain is Layer 1, or basically a backbone, and companies like Bitpay and Coinbase, the layer 2, provide the actual service. In this vision we basically recreate the current system. We replace Paypal with Bitpay and Goldman Sachs with Coinbase or Circle. Nothing changes save that, arguably, bitcoin can not be inflated away. So in this vision bitcoin is a digital gold which does not quite belong to you, over which you have no control, and more importantly, it is not actually gold at all because Bitpay or Coinbase can easily inflate it within their own centralised databases. Thus, we have no bitcoin, gold, or cash.
The main argument against bitcoin as cash is that we can not scale it. Yet here we have Gavin with the proposal to scale it. The main argument against Gavin's proposal is that if we do scale it, then bitcoin will become centralised, yet no one has provided any analysis or estimates of the number of nodes that would decrease if the proposal is followed, or how such number of nodes may change in the future.  
Satoshi, from his comments, seems to have envisioned that nodes would be run on servers, not that we all would be using Bitpay or Coinbase. 2,000 datacentres scattered around the world is decentralised. The ability of everyone to start a new datacentre without requiring permission from the protocol is decentralised. 
I'm with Gavin. I want Bitcoin to be cash, not USD with proof of work, and I want every Starbucks coffee on the blockchain, not on Bitpay, Coinbase or Circle. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 23:09:48
I don't know why anyone pays any attention to this guy who is getting famous off Bitcoin. His department does not have ONE person with a background in computing and his proposals show NO understanding of Bitcoin. Moreover, as Bitpay has said and most other respectable businesses, there are already AML, KYC etc rules in place, so there is no need whatever for Bitlicenses.
He had an opportunity and he blew it. Time to shun him and shut him off until he completely drops his proposals and declares that all Bitcoin businesses are regulated as long as they comply with the already in place AML, KYC etc.

As you said, everyone agrees on the decentralisation aspect. Gavin has shown that it would cost only $6 per month to run a node even if the full 20mb is used. The critics are simply concluding that there would be more centralisation even when the numbers show otherwise. So, I suppose it is only fair to ask for some analysis, with logic and numbers, rather than conclusions.
Seeing as even currently most people do not run a node as it is inconvenient, thus we can presume that those who do run a node are either financially incentivised to do so or hobbyists, how would a cost of less than netflix subscription all the sudden lead to centralisation?
As for Gavin's hard fork statement, he seems to me to be working hard to reach a consensus, but the critics seem to be ignoring him entirely and not actually engaging with the numbers he has given and with his replies to their concerns. 
If the critics fail to engage him with maths rather than rhetorics, then what exactly is Gavin meant to do? I don't think a split benefits anyone, but the current situation is also highly dysfunctional as one side seems to me to be subjective, opinionated, and asking us to take them on trust.

One side has to accept defeat. If the issue is mainly political, then let the public decide and once such decision is made the losing side has to just accept it. 
There has been no analysis whatever or estimates of the number of nodes that would stop running even if, for some reason, miners started using the full max limit from get go. 
Perhaps some small solo miner with some bad connection who does not want to put in more investment would not be able to continue, but, in my opinion, considering that mining and running a node already requires plenty of investment and high end computers as well as a decent connection, I think these miners would be very few in numbers.
The far greater risk to centralisation is sending all transactions offchain where trusted third parties can be fined as ripple or for the fees to increase to a point where only the rich or criminals use it.
If people do not want a "hardfork battle", they have to accept that, when compromise is not possible, the will of the majority necessarily prevails. 
From the only poll so far, albeit unscientific of course, more than 70% support increasing the blocksize with ~10% undecided. So either bring in some alternative or work with Gavin to see how his proposal can be improved.

I am curious how big banks would not go away if lets say bitcoin fully replaces a national currency.
With bitcoin you can not do fractional banking. The supply of bitcoins does not increase, it is static, so if you have 1000 bitcoins, you loan 900 out, then expect to be paid back 1100 bitcoins, where is this 200 bitcoins going to come from? Currently the money to pay off interest comes from more money being printed. If more money can not be printed interest can not be paid back, thus the bank necessarily collapses, thus why would anyone deposit their bitcoins expecting to eventually lose them all? 
@_date: 2015-05-07 10:50:34

Well, that's the experiment. I don't pretend to know the future. All that I know is that bitcoin solves an ancient problem. How that will play out is for the future to say. To camp oneself as a believer or as explicitly stated by yourself, as a non believer, is slightly irrational. It's an innovation, a technological and mental innovation, which solves an ancient problem. That part, I think, is a fact. 
Of course bitcoin has problems. The main problem as far as I am concerned is what I call the "hot wallet problem". That is the necessity for, mainly exchanges, to keep bitcoins online, so opening themselves to the best hackers of the world, since they are accessible from any corner of the world, to take their bitcoins. And, eventually, they will, unless some solution is found. Will it be found? Who knows? Will mining centralisation happen? Who knows? Will fees become prohibitive? Who knows. What we do know is that we have an innovation. An innovation that has managed to survive for 6 long years despite facing what has been a barrage of fire. 
It may yet still fail, but it is still far too early to declare bitcoin as something one believes in or does not believe in, as something that will become what its most hardened "believers" envisage or something that will experience a thousand deaths. 
For now, bitcoin is just a technological innovation playing its course, that has potential as well as problems that need to be addressed. 
The rest should be left to the get rich quick crowd. Those with brains, expertise, and means, must instead look at how the world can be improved and whether this egg that we call bitcoin can, through gradual improvements, lead to such a better world.
The best minds in silicon valley are still looking at how to create yet another picture sharing app. Imagine if their collective mind power was used towards looking at how to create a more efficient way to manage, transfer, spend, save, etc. money. 
2008 taught us something. That something being that the current banking system is highly dysfunctional. By god's grace we were given an alternative which takes advantage of all the technological innovations that have happened in the past century. Of course, it may yet fail, and who is to say that it will or will not, but the task of the smart for now is to run with the only alternative, and take it to its final conclusion, just in case it is better, for, what other alternative is there?

I don't think it is for Gavin to show that increasing the blocksize would lead to centralisation. That is an argument made by it's critics, yet I have not seen any real estimates or educated guesses as to who currently runs nodes, what are their likely resources and how many of them would stop running a node if the blocksize was increased. Instead all we hear is a conclusion that it will lead to centralisation without any analysis.
In fact, as far as estimates are concerned, anyone with a "pretty good" connection is able to run a node even if the max blocksize was used from day 1 which may be unlikely. The blockchain is already big and it already uses much bandwith, cpu, etc. Therefore the individuals currently running a node are likely to not be the average joe, but someone with a "pretty good" connection. How many of them would stop running a node? 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%? Is 4,000 nodes centralised? Is 3,000, 2,000, etc.
All we hear by the critics is a conclusion without analysis. We all can form opinions, but this is a debate. Give us the analysis and the estimates without the hyperbole that all the sudden bitcoin would become fully centralised. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 10:09:11
It shouldn't be controversial. Jeff Garzick pointed out all the way back in 2010 that 1mb was too limiting and satoshi suggested that it could be increased. Satoshi even further predicted that nodes would be run on servers. 
The controversy seems to come from individuals who consider decentralisation to mean what exists now when decentralisation means no central entity. If there are 800 distinct datacentres, what's the problem? 
If you want everyone to still be able to mine on their own cpu though, which would admittedly be very nice, bitcoin is, unfortunately, far passed that, but there are altcoins that promise it.

If I have to choose between the vision of the person who "proved that a decentralised currency like bitcoin is impossible" and the vision of the architect of this decentralised currency who designed it and made it possible, I'll go with Satoshi whose proposals Gavin seems to be implementing.
It just seems to me that you have not fully thought of the decentralisation aspect and how a cost of $6 per month to run a node under 20mb is so negligible as to need not even be taken into account.
Above you said that nodes have gone down from some 50,000 to 5,000. Have you ever wondered why? Well, it is most probably because back then everyone was mining, and thus needed a node, however, gpus and asics, which caused much of the mining "centralisation", rather than the blocksize, - although it is still pretty decentralised - means that most people can not mine any longer without substantial up front investment.
Thus, people do not run nodes even now when the required resources are just a normal computer.
The only way to increase the node numbers is to increase the number of businesses, to increase the number of users, to increase the value of bitcoin so that investing in mining is profitable, etc. That would be achieved by scaling the network, not limiting it at an arbitrary number which was explicitly set temporarily and explicitly expected to be increased.
Thanks for the rhetorics though and the emotional "the Bitcoin community wants to go commit suicide" in reply to an explicit request for hard numbers.
You're a programmer, presumably a maths guy, leave the words to the literature graduates and give the numbers of how bigger blocks means, exactly, more centralisation.

Personally, I do not see how any rationally minded person can support the principle of a company or citizen not being allowed to do anything unless explicitly permitted. The current legal principle of the free world that you can do whatever you wish as long as it is not explicitly prohibited has been established for century and serves our liberty and prosperity very well. If our current rulers wish to change that principle they need to unsettle some fundamental principles of liberty with much more concrete arguments than simply, but you might play the system. 
As I said, they may require a license to ensure that you comply with the requirements, but to then require permission for every little act goes far too far. Taking the examples you gave earlier, there are other laws governing saving accounts, lending, share trading, options, futures, etc. However, that specific proposal is no different than communism, whereby the central government dictates every act that a company may do, without even defining what acts they can oversee, but simply stating, in a blank check manner, that we - the detached, without being at the mercy of the market, government, must decide every step you take. That's a receipt for exodus either voluntarily or because the market will shun those companies as USSR found out. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 10:37:06
Yes, and the users decide by choosing which coin to sell or buy or the exchanges and merchants by choosing which coin to accept. 
As far as the public is concerned, most (more than 70% with ~10% undecided) seem to support the blocksize increase anyway, and many companies have come out in favour of it, so I would guess most nodes would upgrade.

Ah, yes, the fear that some mighty government, who is not made of people, who does not respond to the public's opinion, who is not voted in, decides to act as if they are hitler and rule it illegal.... China tried it, Russia is giving it a try too, we'll see where that goes. It so happens that unless they ban computers, companies settled in other jurisdictions will always be able to infiltrate their bans. 
I believe you need to study bitcoin a bit deeper and see the many layers of balancing between competing interests as far as the viability of the protocol is concerned. Mining is unlikely to become a monopoly simply due to v, but even if it did, that monopoly would depend on the merchants, the users, the node downloaders, the devs, etc. limiting any effect it may have if it turned malicious, or others forced it to become malicious as that monopoly miner would fully depend on the wider ecosystem.
Mining does cost yes, but does it cost more than the current money issuing process? Just one UK bank so happens to make one billion, two billion, and at the height of the boom, six billion a year in profits. How much do all the banks combined cost?
The "[need for a] continuous stream of new investment" may be of concern to a get rich quick crowd. As far as bitcoin the protocol is concerned, 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin and there will only be 21 million of them. Bitcoin itself does not need any continuous stream of investors. 
As far as "zero" fees, satoshi said it best, there will either be a lot of transactions or no transactions. I don't have satoshi's brains to predict what the fees may be in the future, but currently, as far as the protocol is concerned, the fees are as good as zero.
Finally, the human part. I hear that the human part used to be worse, but we are still in the amateur hour. The reason for that is because bitcoin is still a very new thing and it has attracted the brightest. Some of the brightest people use their ingenuity for the good of all, some use it for their own advantage alone. We need more of the former, but many of them so happen to be already engaged in whatever they are doing to dedicate their time to bitcoin and what the bitcoin human echosystem needs. That's changing, and very quickly. As long as persons like you see something that attracts them to bitcoin, even if only to criticise it, then that amateur hour might too come to pass.

You misunderstand that saying. It is actually a direct criticism of what you stated earlier, that we need "perfection". That saying translates to... if you think you have it all figured out, think again, because you don't.
"Perhaps you might argue that the authors of these posts was inconsistent with themselves."
Or, perhaps much more correctly, that you don't quite understand the many inbuilt incentives. Specifically, as far as the debate at hand is concerned, the reason why anyone runs a node and what would increase the number of nodes rather than allowing them to continue a downward path.

On the other hand that centralised system has a lot of costs, chiefly some 10,000 employees most of whom do account handling which is replaced by proof-of-work. 
"There will either be no transactions or a lot of transactions". Bitcoin can scale, in my opinion, and it would be just as efficient, if not more so, if everything is taken into account. 
If it doesn't scale, then we would be forever left with entities like bitpay, which isn't much different than paypal or entities like coinbase, which isn't much more different than a bank. Thus we would have gone full circle as no one, but some fraction of %, would be able to be their own bank.

That has the effect of basically turning the legal principles from "you have permission to do anything that is not explicitly prohibited" to "you do not have permission to do anything unless it is explicitly permitted".
That change of a fundamental legal principle has huge ramification for innovation. Bureaucrats are very, very, slow. Just look at the ETF, two years and still nothing. If companies had to wait two years for supernintendo to approve their multi-sig then those companies will quickly go out of business as their competitors, based on much more friendly jurisdictions such as perhaps London, move much faster to meet the demands of the market. 
If there is some "harmful" update, they should specify what exactly requires permission rather than some blank check to the supernintendo.

When one side is engaging in analysis, logical arguments and maths as Gavin is and the other side simply states conclusions, opinions, or makes subjective comments, as your post illustrates, then yes one side is being divisive. 
Btw, this isn't even Gavin's proposal, its Satoshi's, the person who designed this whole system and knows better than anyone else how it works and how it will likely scale moving forward. When someone like Peter Todd or Gregory Maxwell (who, ironically "proved" that a decentralised currency was impossible) lightly disagrees with Satoshi, without giving concrete analysis, hard maths, and engaging in logical inferences, well, then I'd rather take the vision of the architect of the whole system and of Gavin who has worked on this problem for years now and has addressed all the criticisms with analysis and numbers rather than subjective opinions.

Yet we need to trust some of the devs on a political issue, when more than 70% of the public favours the block increase, with 10% undecided.
If there are reasons to not increase it as far as centralisation is concerned, then where is the rebuttal, with analysis and hard numbers, to Gavin's 


Mining being currently more centralised than it was previously is chiefly due to aisics. There was a huge discussion about mining centralisation back when Ghash reached 51%. They are at almost 14% now. If money is to be made and the barrier to entry is only an upfront investment then entrepreneurs will take advantage ensuring that, we hope, there is always decentralisation, although, of course, less than when everyone could mine on their own cpu.

How would the fork be urgent? As we saw with the stress test, nothing happens that makes it some sort of emergency. It's just that confirmations are delayed by some 8 hours or longer. Then people start leaving because bitcoin has become unreliable, slow, expensive, etc. 
In that scenario, there will probably still be a tiny minority, and remember it is really tiny, just some 15% oppose increasing the blocksize, who will argue that these delays are fine, that people "taking low value transactions" to centralised services is fine, that bitcoin isn't meant to be used for payments, etc.
As far as the public is concerned, some 80% support, which we already have, is pretty much as close to any consensus as anyone can hope.
So why wait until bitcoin's reputation is tarnished even further,  instead of being proactive and making the changes now.

But isn't that the whole point of ancap? That someone doesn't have to interpret consensus? If someone is needed to interpret consensus then the whole philosophy falls down because it is no different than what currently exists. Currently we have a government who tries to define consensus and their definition, through some evolution I suppose, has reached to a two party "democracy", whereby a collective decides for everyone else. 
Ancap is different though isn't it? It holds the individual higher than the collective. It allows the individual to chose what they wish regardless of what the collective thinks. Thus eradicating any need for any interpretation of consensus or any other order giving authority. 
And there is a reason for that. The reason being what I said earlier. No one knows better, unless they can show it beyond any reasonable doubt in a factual manner of course, no one knows better what should be done in a given situation, thus it is for the individual himself to decide and bear his own consequences.
What you are suggesting with "consensus", bearing in mind this isn't some factual issue, is no less than stagnation. You are suggesting that the community by individual choice can not pass judgment on matters that may not be absolutely certain. That instead any change should be some coma here or dot there, but no evolution.
And lets take the beast head on. The 21 million limit. Firstly Satoshi never actually encoded that limit in hard stone, it was added by devs just last year I think. Secondly, we have not even heard of any arguments in favour of it's increase. If say in 20 years it does appear that the fees are insufficient, and for the example let us suppose we are using lightning, considering that so many coins have already been lost irrevocably and may continue to be lost, what makes you think that you can today pass judgment on what may be a different situation?
Dogma kills adaptation and is in turn killed by evolution. We don't have absolute truths. We have an experiment. I can not say whether Satoshi was right or wrong to suggest that nodes should specialise. Maybe he was wrong, maybe he wasn't. But what makes you think you can say for certain, to the point where you take direct action, that he was wrong?
You can't theymos. You have an opinion. You are welcome to lay it out amongst all of us, argue the points with us, but do not proclaim yourself emperor, especially when you gain nothing whatever from doing so, because you *could* be wrong. Increasing the blocksize through bitcoinxt, or even putting pressure through it, *could* be the right way for the community to move forward.

I don't quite understand this "consensus" concept. When was it exactly decided that changes should now happen by "consensus"? What does "consensus" mean exactly?
To me this "consensus" requirement sounds a bit collectivist. This specification that everyone or someone must decide what everyone runs... rather than each individual deciding for himself. 
Obviously consensus is useful if it is some technical thing. If someone finds a real problem with some maths equation then yes we'd like everyone to agree on facts. 
But I am not sure we can "govern" by "consensus". And of course bitcoin itself technically has no such requirement. Bitcoin follows the longest chain. It does not care if it is 40% or 60% on the longest chain, as long as it is the longest. That technically means a democracy. A sort of direct democracy, or even anarchy as some may call it. A process whereby each individual himself decides rather than being ordered to do something as would be the case under "consensus".

Perfection does not exist. "If you meet the Budha, kill him." And your concept of consensus is flawed. Even taking your suggestion that there is no consensus right now, a decision will be made either way and one side of the "consensus" will be disenfranchised whichever choice is made. So if there is no consensus then any decision, by definition, will not be made by consensus. That's why in these sort of situations the other concept "supermajority" comes into play. And from what I have seen, except for two devs and you, the economic supermajority seems to be in favour of increasing the blocksize. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 14:18:57
I found this elaboration on the bitxoinxt website informative:
"Bitcoin XT was created due to a series of fundamental disagreements between Bitcoin core developers. The disagreements revolve around questions like "Should the block chain grow to match user demand?", "What data should the Bitcoin protocol provide to clients?" and "How should technical decisions be made?".
The biggest and most intractable disagreement is about the block size: the XT community believes the block size must grow in order to support Bitcoin's expanding user base. The Bitcoin Core project has made no move towards increasing the limit, in order to incentivise the creation and use of alternative, non-block chain based financial systems such as the so-called Lightning network. This is an irreconcilable difference of vision that has proven impossible to surmount.
Additionally, the Bitcoin Core developers have made statements that imply they no longer care about unconfirmed transactions or lightweight peer to peer wallets, although both are relied upon by many users. It is unclear that these features will remain viable without a fork."
So the double spending alert system seems to have not been merged for "ideological" reasons. In regards to overview of the code... firstly it is open source so anyone can check it for themselves, secondly there are at least three experienced devs working on it, Gavin Anderseen, Mike Hearn and Tom Harding. Thirdly, Jeff Garzick will probably join as will Wladimir (the current maintainer) and maybe some other devs and then the thousand of other devs that currently contribute to core but want bigger blocks as well as the wallet developers, exchange developers etc. So, it's no different than core really, except that the blockstream guys will prob be more focused on sidechains which they are probably already doing anyway as that is what they are paid for by blockstream.

I have not seen any direct answer to how blockstream, a for profit company, intends to make any profit and since you are an employee of theirs I thought maybe you can tell us.
The reason why I thought to ask is because by any independent view; offering to the consensus, after months/years of debate, an increase to 1.04mb in two years comes across as unconscionable, thus raising the questions.
As for your attempt to rewrite history - Gavin changed his offer to 8mb only... and that was rejected, as you well know. It started with 20 plus %, then just 20, the miners wanted 8mb so that is what Gavin offered, but upon it being nacked, he went back to what is more reasonable, 8mb with a % because no one wants this debate to happen again. Plus there is already a BIP offering only 8MB and I have not seen any ack by nullc, pieter, or you.

From recent events... spoofing satoshi's email, blockstreem employees trying to convince people that what is clearly a fake email is real, blockstream employees trying to remove titles, blockstream employees trying to attack bitcoin itself by an ill thought out nonxt nonsense.... and much more
It has become clear that blockstream has a serious financial interest that is solely based on the blocksize remaining as small as possible. Therefore they won't compromise. Instead they are going to workshops in September, workshops in December, workshops all the way to 2020 to stall things.
Your only choice is bitcoin XT. That is why it was proposed. Gavin, a Yale educated very grounded and level headed man who has steered bitcoin to the success it has become, would not propose a fork if blockstream and it's employees were in any way open to a compromise. Their livelihoods, unfortunately, depend on non compromising.
So go to the bitcoinxt sub, run a bitcoinxt node, mine bitcoinxt blocks and propel this brilliant decentralised thing to greatness.  
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:47:36
Seemingly Meni seems to be saying that he is in favour of 8mb considering the two choices that are available right now. Sure there are more options, but between the two choices he prefers 8mb. So are you saying you in favour of 8mb now?
And since maaku declined to answer and as questions have now been raised in regards to blockstream employees requesting removal of titles, suggesting sabotaging of bitcoin, trying to mislead people into thinking that an obviously fake email is from Satoshi, or even perhaps spoofing such emails, thus raising questions, mind answering:
What is blockstream's, a for profit company, business model and why is it being kept secret?
@_date: 2015-08-14 16:51:11
The stress test was just that, a test, with fake transactions by individuals who did not quite care whether their transaction went through or not as they were just testing. During that period there was a backlog of 40k transactions or more. Each of those transactions could be an individual making a genuine purchase or trying to buy, sell, basically trying to use bitcoin as it is meant to be used, and they had to wait hours on end, or even days, for 1 confirmation.
The thing with fees is that capacity is limited. Let us say that there are a million users each making 1 genuine transaction, thus 1 million transactions in total. Only 200k transactions can go through whatever fee they pay. Even if you pay a fee of 1 million dollars, it is only 200k transactions paying that fee that go through. The other 800k have to wait for hours on end, see their transaction drop out etc. because the capacity is simply capped at 200k and there is nothing they can do about it.
Now lightning is being promised as a saviour. So people will have to learn not only about the complexities of bitcoin, but also about how to open and close hubs, the fees, which hub is "best" etc. Moreover,  lightning is a very new and complex thing. We are dealing with money here so we shouldn't rush things and ignore any bugs that might otherwise not be ignored because of bias or whatever debate is going on. Lightning needs to be fully coded, very tested, security penetrated and even then it should be a choice. Perhaps it's final implementation is less secure than bitcoin itself, or maybe less private, or more inconvenient to use... There is no reason why we should hang all our hopes in what remains a mere concept with known conceptual security problems and we certainly should not force people to use lightning or not use bitcoin at all.

And bitcoin is not blockstream's project.

@_date: 2015-08-19 16:21:06
I'm not sure. Blockstream employees for example (and core devs), who are mods of  (the irc channel), seem to be somewhat keen on censoring xt discussion on that chan. Not outright banning it, but bigger block supporters get banned eventually for no reason. That's why  had to be created, just as here on reddit the bitcoinxt sub had to be created

That's one article by Coin Telegraph and we know the level of professionalism these Coinnews sites have, but even reading that article and ignoring the F2Pool comments we have this from BTCChina:
"BTCChina Pool will unfortunately not be running Bitcoin XT due to its experimental nature".
No mention of any contentious hardfork there and before you suggest it is taken out of context you are welcome to find where BTCchina states they would not be running it because it is contentious. They are instead saying because it is "experimental". A very reasonable concern, but I am sure that is now in the process of changing and changing very quickly.
The other comment is from Houbi which talks about testing. Again quite a reasonable thing to say, but in this case one can note that firstly it does not say they will not run XT and secondly it does not in any way say they will not run it becaus contentious.
Then we have a final comment from AntPool which says:
""We like the idea of increasing the maximum block size, but if Bitcoin XT is too contentious, we also don't want the community to be divided."
And of course no one wants to divide the community, save for maybe one or two people, including perhaps at least one core dev who seems to provide little bitcoin code but seems to shout doom all the time, even selling some 50% of his bitcoins and see himself be proven totally wrong with the Ghash pool now being some 2%, but, the community won't divide. The support for bigger blocks is immense. All or at least most major bitcoin businesses have come out in favour, the majority of miners want it, most users... so the community would remain very much united. Thus addressing AntPool's worries. 
So I stand by what I said. Only F2Pool seems to be actually against and even they I suspect are not quite against, but are just being ill advised.

@_date: 2015-08-19 17:59:53
I don't think so. One side (XT) is cheerful, hopeful, taking action, creating subs, creating a community, building things. The other side (blockstream) is scaremongering, trying to engage in fear, trying to engage in sabotage, offering no hope but the terrible centralised hammer of censorship, of veto powers, of control. 
Bitcoin belongs to us, the people. Satoshi gave it to us as a gift and programmed it in such a way that no one can control it. That is what we are proving, by action. 
Look at r/bitcoin, it's dead, negative, censorship all around. Look at the bitcoinxt sub, it is colourful, cheerful, open information everywhere.
You wanted freedom, this is freedom. Act accordingly.

@_date: 2015-08-19 17:23:59
If you want an argument from principle theymos which you can address, bitcoinxt is clearly not an altcoin... you said as much yourself back when you were not being influenced. " If the network disagrees about a policy, then a split is good." Something which is contradicted by a censorship policy. 
Bitcoin XT right now is just an alternative client and that is good. It would be dangerous if bitcoin was centralised to only one client. The more clients the better as far as centralisation is concerned. You do not like this feature, you can choose, thus the free market decides.
As far as the chain fork, and there is no logic, principle, rhetoric, or anything else you can use to deny the following, XT won't chain fork until 75% agree, up until the point of 75%, there is no new coin, nor a fork, therefore there is no new coin. Once the threshold is met, then it would be the new, eXtended bitcoin, evolving etc, and the shorter chain would die or become a tiny altcoin. So by definition bitcoinxt is not and can not be an altcoin. 
You may think people are trying to influence this debate, but you yourself suggest that the blocksize should be increased. Ok, maybe not 8mb, maybe not 40%, maybe 6 mb, maybe 20%. You yourself say that was what Satoshi suggested. You yourself quote Mike Hearn with approval. 
So it is true someone is trying to influence the debate and I put it to you that someone is blockstream. Their business model seems to depend on limiting bitcoin to 1mb, a tiny cap which allows for only 200k transactions. Their whole survival seems to depend on it, as I can not otherwise explain their spoofing of Satoshi's email address, their petty request to remove titles, they plans to trick forks thus causing severe mayhem and devaluation of your holdings. They don't seem to care because they have 21 million dollars upon which they need a return.
If you are truly not beholden to them save for maybe hiring some bockstream developer or talking to them, and if you are truly interested in the long term success of bitcoin itself, then I should hope that you can see the views of both sides and that one side is playing very dirty because their livelihood depends on it.

Miners provide security not because they are some saints which believe in charity, but because they are self interested and for profit motivated. Why would miners want to give up their fees to centralised kyc-ed hubs? Why would miners use hash power in a chain not accepted by the majority of exchanges and merchants? Why would miners who might like some VC investment go against what is obvious... a capacity of 200k is far too low for any medium term revenue and no one will start paying any 1 dollar fees very soon. So, especially with the halving in a few months, best have higher capacity to allow more uses and although the fee by each individual may be lower, in combination it would be far more than by turning users away.

Thank you for responding. How exactly did you decide that such consensus has not been achieved? There may be 1-2-3 maybe 10-20 or even 100 people against XT, but are they 5% or 10% of the "consensus"?
You don't know. We don't know. The stage of determining whether there is a consensus or not is no where near yet. It would be sometime next year when it can be established whether there is a "consensus". What you are doing, what theymos is doing with that highly biased post, is trying to pre-empt consensus. Trying to decide in the most authoritative manner by censoring.
You can not say where consensus lays or whether the hard fork is or would be contentious when it is not even operational yet nor have the "consensus" been given the chance to show their cards yet.
What I see here is fear, both from u/theymos and as well as other devs. Fear that unless it is absolutely free to run a node only big corps will be able to do so. Yet that fear is misplaced and it is misplaced because it uses old paradigms to analyse new paradigm shifting inventions. Bitcoin requires the people's consensus. Not Bashco's or theymos or anyone's specific consensus. 
As you do not know Bashco, nor does Theymos, nor does Gregory Maxwell, nor does any other person, as to how this tradoff should be carried out, then the only way to proceed is to allow the wisdom of the crowd to decide which contains experts of all levels and accept their decision, rather than try to dictate it.
That is afterall what decentralised means, what bitcoin means.

He does say he is weakly against, but he also says "I do not doubt a block size increase will *work*"  
"Also the politics aspect (at some point it becomes a question of who decides for who? who is excluded? all those human decisions...) of this I don't like in the least. Possibly unavoidable at some point, but that's something *I*'d like to kick down the road."
Which suggests that he just does not want to make the decision himself and has already said as much. Paraphrasing "I'm the maintainer, I merge what everyone else agrees"
Contrast that with the staunch blockstream employee's opposition without giving any consideration to the solution proposed, without weighing the options, but just saying nack. 
By the way, is any of the blockstream employee's in favour or do they get directions from Adam Back?

It is not off topic at all unless you are suggesting you have some expertise in international law.
If it is indeed the case that the law to be applied when a service is provided over the internet is where the customer is physically present then all say Amazon sales done in America should be taxed by a USA tax rate and so too any profits made on those sales, thus making offshore accounts redundant for companies....
The internet changes things and continues to do so... one can't simply apply old laws to new borderless technologies without some conceptual and logical wrestling. 
Now if you can indeed cite such international law... and it has to be international law only, rather than domestic, as the commerce is cross borders then you can continue to say that it is where the customer is physically located. If you can't cite such law then there is no reason at all to give the customer's location prevalence over that of the company as far as the company's liability is concerned. 
@_date: 2015-08-08 11:30:55

What exactly do you mean by this? Specifically "the entire". My understanding is that your philosophy is ancap, though I may be mistaken. Someone else deciding something for you is wrong isn't it as far as ancap is concerned? Specifically, everyone else deciding what you should do... as would be the case under you definition of "consensus" is collectivist isn't it and requires some sort of government or governance, someone to decide "consensus", to decide what "for all practical purposes" means, etc.
I would have thought you would prefer a more individualistic approach. Whereby you are free to choose whether to run Bitcoinxt or the current client. And that you would prefer such individualistic approach, rather than entrusting you decision to some "elders" or government or whatever because and only because no one knows what is absolute best therefore everyone should decide for themselves. Not be ordered by "consensus" which, unless it is a factual question, means nothing more or less than some "government" which decides what consensus is. 


You an ancient man in these lands theymos and personally I don't doubt that you want to do the right thing, but you do not quite know what exactly is the right thing in this situation. You have your opinion of course and you probably feel strongly about it, but when there are people like Gavin, like Garzick, like Satoshi, and companies like Bitpay, suggesting something, seriously considering it, and finding wide support, the chance that you might be wrong is very real. 
Bitcoin is at a cross road and has to decide a very important question which does not have a certain answer. With hindsight it will be obvious what the decision should be, right now it isnt. What we have is a weighing of scales, a passing of judgment if you like. I would rather leave this judgment to everyone's individual choice and fully accept their decision than bear any responsibility whatever for personally making the wrong choice and by so doing imposing this wrong choice upon everyone else.
That's the truth you asked for theymos as far as I can see it.

If the majority of miners think that a blocksize of bigger than 32mb is preferred, there would be a long and destabilising debate and the blocksize would be increased above 32mb anyway. 
By the way Garzick does not think that BIP100 needs a 32mb cap, so I don't see why it should be there at all when increasing max has a voting process. BIP100 and a 32mb cap is a contradiction in my opinion.

I still find it very vague. Seeing as blockstream hires many bitcoin developers, some of whom have recently shown that blockstream has a serious financial interest in keeping bitcoin at 1mb, mind specifying how exactly blockstream intends to make money.
One way of doing so is by making public whatever business plan you showed to the VCs that invested in blockstream. Another way is to be as specific as you possibly can. CT is open source which anyone can use... I don't see where the profits come from that. Elements  Alpha is also, or will be (I think) open source. As for people can hire you... well they can hire you or anyone else anyway.

The other changes are in regards to SPV wallets. Again, although they are not 100% safe, they are good enough for people on smart phones and others. I'd rather try and make them safer and better rather than as some of the core devs think.... make them less safe and in the process make bitcoin more difficult to use.

However provides no hard maths, no concrete analysis, nor any logical arguments, from what I have seen, for being against, but subjective opinions. Furthermore I think he has suggested that there should be NO intentional fork of bitcoin contentious or otherwise. That's a receipt for not evolving and what does not evolve tends to die.
But I am actually genuinely curious, why are you so vocally opposed? You have heard all that has been said so far I think, why do you think that Satoshi's idea of nodes becoming more specialised, while still remaining censor resistant and decentralised, is not the only option considering the many criticisms in regards to lightning which I am sure you have read?

It is not a safeguard at all. If most miners want a blocksize of greater than 32mb, then they will get a blocksize greater than 32mb. The only thing the cap does is ensure that a destabilising debate happens which is not in anyone's interest. That is why Garzick does not want that 32mb cap and that is why it should not be there.

I think Gavin tried to compromise and has compromised. Remember this started with 20mb and 50% growth, now it is 8mb.
Really, if this was a sort of negotiation which is what a compromise would entail, one side started with 1mb, Gavin with 20, the other side moves to 2, Gavin to 8, they go to 3, Gavin to 6 and they meet somewhere in the middle 4 or 5mb. Gavin would probably think this is a bit too low, the other side a bit too high, but both would find it acceptable considering that a compromise is necessary.
Same with % increase. I do not think we would want another fork over this debate again seeing how it has developed. So one side would start with 0%, Gavin with 50%, the other side 5, Gavin 40, the other side 10, Gavin 30, and meet somewhere in the middle of 15 - 20%.
4mb with 15-20% is the compromise solution really. I wouldn't compromise any further on that and I think that almost everyone would be happy for it except for a fringe hardcore tiny minority and unfortunately there will always be a hardcore tiny minority with any change either due to ideological or financial reasons.
Unfortunately the other side did not want to compromise. I hear for example that Gregory Maxwell is against intentional hard forks in general and as long as he says nack then there can be no "consensus" and there would be a "contentious" hard fork. Pieter was willing to compromise, after a 4 months debate, but instead of going to 2mb to start with some % increase, he suggested 1.04mb in two years! We can't be debating forever seeing as this matter has been going on for years and, as they are unwilling to compromise then Gavin is right to go with his original proposal which has been modified to take miner's concerns into account.
If we don't move ahead then we basically give one man or two, that being nullc or pieter, veto powers which would be quite a dangerous precedent. 
Finally, BitcoinXT is not set in stone. If miners or the community has any concerns with the size or the %increase, then they can raise them and their concerns can be addressed as they did for example by saying a jump to 20mb was too much, but 8mb was acceptable.

It seems to me that only F2Pool is vocally against an XT fork. By the way this is the pool which forked the network just a month ago because they do no validation of their mining at all, showing how much they care about bitcoin... On the side, I do not think it is F2Pool itself, but to me it seems that they are unfortunately being ill advised by Peter Todd specifically as shown by their statement that they just thought Full RBF was a cool new technology.
But, on the wider picture, no one is suggesting a fork as the first option. However, we can not let 2 core devs effectively act like ancient kings and simply block any changes or improvements and instead embroil any suggestion into endless debates about what ifs and improbable possibilities. 
Plus, even so late in this debate, u/nullc, Peter Todd, u/theymos, or anyone else, has not even provided any analysis, any maths, any logics, on what the block size should be exactly and how it should change. 
Instead they present us subjective opinions which have been debunked with hard maths. Yet they refuse, and their refusal is unreasonable, and when the other "side" is unreasonable you route around the problem and fork them off. Because bitcoin does not require the permission of two core dev's.

There are plenty of altcoins there that are super decentralised which you are free to use. Some of them even have some sort of constitution which states that unless users are still able to mine on a desktop, they will fork to change the mining algorithm.
As far as bitcoin is concerned, it's original design was set in stone by Satoshi who explicitly stated how it would scale. Litecoin seems to be fine with 4mb blocks as does dogecoin with 20mb blocks... 
Anyway, I'm tired of this discussion as well as being extremely perplexed by it and this highly incompetent handling of this soft fork by some core devs makes me simply want to not engage it any further at all.

That's a very unreasonable analogy with an extreme offer point which no one would put forward. 


Almost all miners are in favour of 8mb so it is in no way "orders of magnitute outside". It is in fact something almost everyone agrees on, except for nullc and pieter.
So how do we move forward? Do we allow one person to have veto powers? Do you not think that would be an extremely dangerous precedent? As in all you would need to sabotage bitcoin would be to corrupt or coerce just one person. 
They should move and if they do not they have no justification whatever for not doing so. The arguments have been fully laid out and argued to death by this point and the vast majority have explicitly supported 8mb. Maybe that is a bit too high, but turning to this extra super majority with a 1.04mb offer in 2 years is unconscionable and going to some workshop in a month with apparently another second workshop lined up is just outright stalling. 
All of this raises questions, the most obvious being, what exactly is blockstream's business model? Why is that being kept secret?
 
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:31:44
Almost every core developer, except for Blockstream and Peter Todd, is in favour of raising the size. Wladimir is neutral, Garzick is in Favour, Gavin is in Favour, Meni Rosenfeld is in favour, and if you go through the mail list many, many others, except for blockstream.
So can we stop saying the core devs, because it isn't the core devs, it's blockstream and their employees.

@_date: 2015-07-07 09:42:01


The hubs. If it is a settlement layer then the hubs are the only ones who can afford the mining fees. However, the hubs would want to make as few transactions as possible so as to not pay the fees, thus leaving miners at their mercy, potentially reducing their profits, lowering bitcoin's security, etc.
How the dynamics between hubs, crippledcoin, and miners can in any way be balanced I have not seen be said, but I can see this added dynamic instead kill bitcoin as I just outlined. 


No, people stop transacting on the blockchain because it would be far more expensive than the competitors and those who don't trust the security of lightning (even conceptually, hubs can be hacked leading to the loss of everyone's bitcoin through flooding the lightning network) will use some other distributed network such as litecoin or maybe a new altcoin which incorporates all that has been learned so far.

On what basis did you decide that 3 core devs being against something while the supermajority of users and businesses as well as the miners demaning for it means there is no consensus?
Suppose for a hypothetical example that the US gov corrupted these three specific devs, or that a big bank bought them out, or whatever other scenario... And by the way has said, and maybe I am misquoting him in which case I apologise, but it is my understanding that he has said or implied that there should be NO intentional fork of the blockchain - contentious or otherwise. 
This isn't any small technical change over obvious matters where the answer is necessarily clear. This is a decision to be held by the entire community and in such decision no dev or mod or anyone else holds any higher say than anyone else simply because no one can say for absolute certain what the right way to move forward is.
In my personal opinion, if the blocksize is not increased then bitcoin is as good as dead. No one will decide to build any applications on it as they can simply create their own blockchain, thus raising borders and closed gardens like they tried with the internet. This may in any event happen at some point, but this soon?

You are not quite understanding what I am saying. The network now can only clear around 200k transactions per day. If adoption increases and say there are now 1 million perfectly good transactions that genuine bitcoin users want to make for decent sums of say 1btc and higher, 800k of those transactions wont be cleared in a reasonable time regardless of the fee they pay. Only 200k transactions can be cleared. For the rest they have to wait for hours on end, see their transaction drop off completely, try a higher fee and perhaps be outbid, basically the network becomes highly inconvenient to use for the fast majority which makes it pretty much broken hence why Satoshi - the person who created this whole thing - suggested that the blocksize be increased.

I am not sure why anyone upvotes an article which argues: "This is exactly the point and the intent of Bitcoin : to force the poor to yield to the rich, universally, as a matter of course."
Where exactly is that intent expressed either on the whitepaper or on any comment that Satoshi made? 
The intent is clearly peer to peer payment system like cash as stated in the title of the white paper, not some ludicrous payment system for the rich. 
Furthermore, why exactly do these early adopters get free transactions? I suppose if they have to pay nothing then even a fee of 1 million wouldn't matter to them, thus clouding their judgment. Or, otherwise expressed as, "fee market" for the masses, a free ride for the "rich".
God this debate gets more ludicrous the more it continues...
@_date: 2015-07-09 13:11:56
This isn't spam. It's a stress test. Replace all those transactions with an assumption that they are genuine transactions and you can see how unusable bitcoin would become for the vast majority while the infrastructure seems perfectly fine with handling the transactions. 
As for conceptually spam... I don't think anyone can or should judge what is spam and what is not. As long as a transaction applies by the rules, even if it is a 0 fee transaction, a judgement of spam or not is a subjective judgement which can and does lead to censorship. 
My initial calling of them as "in effect, spam" was because I couldn't find a better word to state that the transactions are not genuine as it is a stress test which requires an assumption of genuine transactions with realistic values replaced by 10bit transactions which nonetheless pay the full fee.

I am slightly curious about this quote however: "These users have had to run the bitcoin gauntlet, learning about bitcoin, wallets, blockchains, qr codes, mining fees and basic economics."
Why exactly does a hooker or a mom or even a 12 year old need to know about blockchains, mining fees, basic economics, I might even say bitcoin itself and wallets themselves? What is bitcoin? it's money... valued at currently $300 for 1 bitcoin - - ah cool, how do I get it - you buy it and once you do you keep it in an address, like an email address... how do I send it - you type some numbers on some website...
Why do they need to know about blockchains... mining fees... basic econ etc. I suppose someone intellectually curious might wish to learn about that sort of stuff, but when I ask a doctor about whatever he doesn't then go onto cell theory, he just tells me what medicine to take... if you get my point.

Lmao. Watching the dissonance of people here pertaining to jstolfi is hilarious. 
Since you are so adamant in your knowledge, care to explain how these coins move around in lightning? There is an R - or a public key - and an N - or a private key - only the end receiver knows the N. Yet the R has to go through many hoops until it gets to the end user and it goes through those hoops by, in effect, the hub lending you, say 1 bitcoin, and then being paid back by the end user once the transaction is finished.
So unless I am completely mistaken, and if I am then it is the fault of the lightning devs for their lack of communication, a hub, in effect, is "lending" money, albeit in a cryptographic certain way, but still they have locked funds which are released only once the transaction is complete and the hub will want a fee for that.
Will the fee be 50 cent? Will a blockchain transaction be $25? Jstolfi is right, in regards to either question none of the devs who wish to limit the blockchain have given any analysis or figures. How will the blockchain be secured under lightning? What are the fees estimated to be? How much is a hub estimated to charge? For how long do we lock our bitcoins? What happens if we want to change hubs? How do we maintain privacy in a lightning network? What keeps hubs from being coerced? etc. 
Those are serious questions which must be answered before lightning can in any way be considered to be a serious alternative and just because it is jstolfi raising them does not in any way reduce the veracity of the points he quite rightly raises.

A "fee market" based on an artificial scarcity decided by a tiny minority of a comity is no different than the Fed deciding the scarcity of money supply by printing more or by buying debt. It's an illusion with no market due to lack of competition by miners as the space is capped leading to monopolistic pricing to the point where miners can not feed themselves thus collapsing the whole thing.  
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:50:44
Yes - it is. The vast majority of users in every poll have overwhelmingly, some 80% voted in favour with only 15% against. The vast majority of businesses - and there are quite a few exchanges who have come out in favour - are for the increase. The majority of the miners are in favour of the increase too and from the experts we have Satoshi who created this whole thing, Gavin who worked on this thing from almost day one and Garzick who are in favour.
Is that consensus? By many definitions it is... but who is to decide? Why everyone of course. XT is not even operational yet, it won't "launch" until sometime next year after 75% adopt it. So if XT is ever implemented then by definition it is consensus. 
I just can't see why you or theymos do not stay neutral as far as actions are concerned in what is a fundamental debate in regards to the future of bitcoin. Are you suggesting or is theymos suggesting that you have some higher level of knowledge, some absolute truth that we should all know about which allows you (assuming of course no outside coerce) to think it right to impose your will upon what is a tradeoff decision?
You have your opinions of course in regards to the debate, but they are just opinions. You do not know for certain what is the right course. That is why it is not open to you to decide, but to everyone.

Visa costs around $10 billion per year to run, every year. I doubt there has been more than around 200 million invested in mining power to give us this huge hashrate. The only remaining cost now is electricity and bandwith. Does that cost around 100 million? Maybe 200 million, lets say half a billion. Lets now increase the blocksize, lets say it can accommodate 1k transactions. Would 5 billion be enough? Probably...
I can't see how automating labour costs... which are the most expensive costs... leads to inefficiency when it clearly seems not to as the napkin numbers above show. So I think you are quite wrong and bitcoin is in fact much more efficient, that is why it is cheaper... and even free if you willing to wait or if you have old coins and much faster. The two fundamental selling points as far as the vast majority are concerned.

The only reason why anyone has started talking about the fee market is because the lightning network requires full blocks to reduce the chances that all lightning hubs are flooded and thus all the bitcoins on the lightning network are stolen and one side benefit of that, according to the original lightning devs, is a "fee market".
Before that, I have not seen any plans to increase fees while the current mining subsidy is absolutely huge and puts a dent on all our wealth. Yet you require fees on top? 
Eventually... yes, say in 2030, but as of right now there is no reason whatever to stick to 1mb and I have not actually heard of any analysis that this 1mb is such a magical number for either a fee market or "decentralisation" (whatever that means). 
Capacity should be increased while we still have a subsidy so that the network can handle all transactions and then other layers can be added on top once they prove themselves.

(I do appologise, the post turned out to be far longer than intended)
One has to ask what exactly makes bitcoin decentralised in practical terms. A simple answer is that there is no central authority to decide access, that is the protocol does not require a license etc. from miners or nodes etc. Whether people will want to participate or not, however, is a different question.
If everyone has the opportunity to run a node, and people value such opportunity, then enough people will run a node for the system to be decentralised. I suppose that's economics 101.
Decentralisation does not however mean that running the infrastructure needs be free. Such system would depend on the good will of the participants, thus leading the participants to have to trust each other, as well as suffer from the tragedy of the commons. 
Decentralisation does not mean that running the infrastructure needs be at such a low cost that every single person on earth can do so as that would lead to optimising for the lowest common denominator regardless of whether or otherwise those individuals are even using the opportunity to take part in running the infrastructure, which they probably aren't. 
Necessarily, running a node can not be free regardless of the blocksize or at such a low cost that you can effectively run it on an iPhone. That is why there is the whole capitalistic aspect of the block reward which incentivises participants to invest in the infrastructure for their own benefit and in the processes provide security to all. So requiring a good internet connection is simply asking those who benefit to invest some 6 dollars a month or 60 on some good internet connection. A tiny investment affordable by even someone on a very low income. 
How that would in any way affect anyone who is currently running a node, most of whom probably do so because  they are mining, or running a business, or researching, or value a very high level of privacy, I can not see. 
Do the current node runners really not value the absolute security that running a node provides more than 6 or 60 dollars a month? If not, then the infrastructure is still fragile, relying on the fleeting goodwill of volunteers.

Ladies and Gentelmen, the time has come for each and everyone to decide. 
After months of debate and hearing what everyone has had to say, it is now up to each and every single one of us to decide how we wish to move forward. The answer isn't certain. Some say there will be more centralisation, some argue that as capacity increases and the number of users increases the value of bitcoin increases thus more run nodes and more invest in mining, leading to more decentralisation. Some argue we want a fee market, some think that it is far too early to limit growth. 
Although there is much common ground, a broad agreement has unfortunately not yet been found. That is why it is now up to everyone to decide for themselves whether it is best for bitcoin to increase its capacity, or be limited to 200k transactions.
Because it is fully your decision and no one else's. There is no central authority that can tell us what to do, no mod, no miner, no dev, nor anyone else at all, but yourself. Because this is bitcoin, a fully decentralised, peer to peer network. 
So run a node or upgrade to XT or stick with core but cast your decision and do so responsibly as this is probably the most important decision the community has made since The Times genesis block. And if we do get it right those who follow us may tell our tale and story. And if we get it wrong we can just soft fork it down.

Jeff Garzik was one of the first people, if not perhaps the first person, who questioned the 1mb blocklimit and received the now famous response from Satoshi himslelf: we can just increase it.
And of course we can... Satoshi thought 1 mb as a temporary limit was fine in 2009 - 6 years ago - the computer I bought back then was utter rubbish while now it has 1tb space etc...
I find Jeff to be one of the few core devs who seems to avoid the limelight, while still managing to build a huge reputation for himself without any tarnish. 
If the masses need a neutral voice then they can find it in Jeff. A very professional man, no streaks of authoritarianism as can be found in, dare I say, nullc, aka gmaxwell, aka Gregory Maxwell, nor any utterly nutty conspiracy nonsense that unfortunately follow the extremely able Gavin. 
When something is self evidently good there is no lie that one can create, no rhetorical device that one can employ, no reputation that one can use or abuse to distort the self evident truth...
That truth being bigger blocks are obviously the way to scale right now as most of the core devs are saying, the supermajority of users, businesses, even miners. 
May history have mercy on the foolishness of the first enemy/ies within and may those who follow learn from their, I hope, charitable fate.

I do not think that is quite right. The question about decentralisation is a question of access. Will the vast majority of people still be able to run a node if they so wish? Gavin has provided the numbers to show they will...
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:24:22
Only blockstream can tell you for sure, but an obvious reason would be choice. Giving people the choice on whether to use lightning or sidechains... as would be the case with bitcoinxt... would risk the fact that people may choose to not use either lightning or sidechains, thus make both lightning and sidechains irrelevant. Far better to not give them a choice it seems blockstream thinks and *force* them to use sidechains or lightning, in the meantime blockstream can act as the middleman and the ruler of all things. 
It is an authoritarian bent, which is quite unfortunate, but quite obvious from their censorship, their censorship on irc, their outright attempts to sabotage bitcoin itself by suggesting spoofing of nodes or even blocks...
We should expect this sort of thing as it has existed for millenias and it is exactly what bitcoin tries to address by making it impossible for any company or individual to control it by making it decentralised. And we are proving its decentralised nature right now. 
Emperor Theymos wishes to order us, blockstream wishes to order us. No thank you. Bitcoin has given me freedom. I can't be ordered. I'll route around. I'll go to bitcoinxt sub, run the bitcoinxt node, mine bitcoinxt blocks, because I have been empowered.  
@_date: 2015-08-13 17:09:23

@_date: 2015-07-30 17:30:04
I meant as a "starting point" for an end point in 2021 - so rather than 2mb in 2021 - 200mb. 
Basically my point is that this isn't in any way negotiation. You don't have one side go from 20mb +40%, then 20mb+20% or whatever it is then 8mb plus doubling while the other side, at least it moves now, but from 1mb to 2mb in 6 years?
It's a joke and an insult to this community and Gavin as well as a waste of time. Put forward some real proposal please. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 17:14:40
It is very simple why we can not come to a consensus on this topic. Some individuals have the very flawed emotional belief that bitcoin can not operate if the 1mb size is not increased. Despite it being shown to the contrary by using maths, logics, and analysis, they maintain their belief in a dogmatic manner. Thus making any consensus impossible.
This isn't a new issue as you know Lee. This matter has been debated for years and there is little knew that can be said. Either the dogmatists agree to increase the blocksize or they actually back up their subjective beliefs with maths. If they choose to do neither then there is hardly much choice. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:55:19

I'm not sure if this is a joke. 2 MB by 2021? I mean... negotiation is cool but... we are pretty deep in the negotiation process by now and there have been a number of compromises by the vast majority. So this proposal is a bit insulting to the whole past three months. Try 200 Mb at least as a starting point rather than wasting our time on a two MB proposal by 2021!

There is nothing efficient about having to make the same transaction twice. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:16:20
At $6  a month (less than a netflix subscription) you could easily run a node even if blocks were 20mb or more... far cheaper than paying $10 per transaction. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:05:47
Since this problem was known, what did you do about it?
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:04:33


That's the point. What you seeing right now, few transactions not being confirmed, is the exception, but if these self appointed central rulers calling themselves core devs and giving flares to each other to stand out maintain bitcoin at 1mb it will be the rule... 
Just look at litecoin, it has gone up some 500%, while bitcoin barely moves... one of them can handle transactions, the other is slowly being killed by devs with their game theory nonsense, with their appeasing of mining pools who don't even verify transactions, who mine 0blocks etc
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:00:58
but, 50% is already not doing it so it doesn't really have much to do with the blocksize. 
They have to be forced to validate the blocks in some way and I am not sure why such solution has not been proposed yet. What exactly are all the devs doing with their time? 
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:29:52
You are misunderstanding something quite fundamental. Most of the transactions that have currently increased the mempool are, in effect, spam. However, if adoption is increased all that backlog would be genuine users who have paid the appropriate fee, but were outbid by others who paid an even higher fee. Therefore a substantial proportion of users would have to wait for their transaction to be included regardless of the fee size as there is simply no space.
Now, I do not think that is at all acceptable especially as the network has shown it can handle this scale of transactions. Therefore its a simple storage space and bandwidth costs both of which cost some £20 a month or so. Ergo, no reason whatever to not increase the blocksize to accommodate everyone rather than making the network a pain to use for the vast majority.
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:42:10
So you proposed a lot of thing and some little tweaks, but no solution. Are you suggesting that in some way 50% or more SPV mining is acceptable? or that the problem does not have a solution?


Having the title of "core dev" is some form of compensation as is the 21 million vc investment in your co-founded company which is a direct result of your participation in bitcoin development. So, don't be offended when people ask for some accountability.

Bitcoin... whether under the current chain or a new chain will live on, the question is whether we, the community, will have any say over it's direction or whether we will fail to adapt and see ourselves be washed away by evolution while they re-sell us bitcoin 2.0,  neatly package it, shave the trimmings, and promote it like a patriotic american pie.

The author states that the bitcoins were stolen over time, however, the graph shows that between June and November 2011 there is a gap due to missing data. It then opens in November 2011 with a huge gap between actual btc and expected btc of some 500k bitcoins. Practically almost all the "missing" bitcoins. Suggesting therefore that either they were "lost" sometime between June-November 2011 or they were hidden at the time somewhere on blockchain or that the authors have made some sort of mistake.
I am not sure how such a huge amount of bitcoins can be "lost" within such a short period of 4 months. Leaving open the option that there may be some mix up with the internal data or that the analysis is incomplete.

That's a full transcript of a two way conversation. Which bit is one sided?
@_date: 2015-11-05 08:31:50
So then, why not 30% per year to keep the growth constant with technology and demand? 
Why stop at 8mb when in 4 years technology would have improved to make handling 8mb easy (which can easily be handled today anyway let alone in 4 years)? 
Plus, in any event, I am not sure if gmaxwell agrees with the above proposal or the current lead maintainer. If they can reach a consensus of 6mb plus 30% yearly growth in Hong Kong with implementation January 2016 as blocks are now at full capacity, then I'd be happy with that. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 20:45:54
I'm talking about procedures. It seems to me that this undeniable hard push for what is mainly a settlement layer ideology is hypocritical. You, among many developers, wrote a letter and signed, asking us to wait for a conclusion on the settlement vs proof of work scaling, and we the community so gave you your chance. You, voluntarily came up with a schedule of two conferences, and the last of them is only weeks away.
So why rush it if you are not engaging in underhanded tactics to completely undermine and bypass the consensus by rushing your own ideology of settlement when the people in good faith gave you the time you asked to reach a conclusion?
@_date: 2015-11-07 12:29:29
Not over the years. At the beginning, yes. I don't know why they did so, but over the years he has I would think managed to erode their trust and the trust of all bitcoiners with the way he used those donations and now with the way he is treating this public space created on a branded name which belongs to all of us gifted by Satoshi himself.
I used to like theymos and even spoke in his defence during witchhunt times last year, but now I honestly believe he is causing grave harm by censoring in a community which has the main ethos of decentralised, permissionless, uncensorable. 
Whether you support XT or not, big or small blocks, should have nothing to do with an authoritarian centralised act which we have railed against for years and even gathered here to make such acts impossible through bitcoin. It is just plain wrong and in no way a solution, but a damaging attack on this community. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 13:06:55
It is in fact coinbase who speaks on behalf of the majority of users, not you. The supermajority of users has made their opinion quite clear. They want bigger blocks and they want them right now. As coinbase depends on their users, they are acting in their own self interest by combining all their voices into one, and thus by speaking on their behalf. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 21:20:03


And who placed those thought leaders in charge to rule what is or isn't? The community is undergoing a huge debate right now about scalability. The more underlying debate is settlement vs proof of work scaling. The developers asked them for more time to reach a consensus, so we, the community, out of respect, gave them more time. The developers chose their own time schedule of two conferences, one already held in Montreal, another to be held in Hong Kong only weeks away.
For them to now turn around, release what is a settlement layer op code, push 0conf transactions away in favour of rbf, push the community to adopt the settlement layers by "psa", is an undermining of their own requests and an act which questions their good faith.
You can not ask for more time to reach a decision on settlement vs proof of work while at the same time pushing your preferred choice of settlement. That is underhanded and in no way a good faith action. 
As for your everyone this or that, I fully disagree. I'll take satoshi's words, and if you think he was wrong then present your own white paper with how a settlement layer system will work so that we can judge it in the light of day rather than in the darkness as it seems to be pushed. You certainly may be right, but present it out there. How does this settlement system function, how to we ensure decentralisation under it, how do we secure privacy, uncensorability, etc. 
And for the rest, this is a censored and heavily moderated forum where many have been banned, so I expect downvotes, but there is no reason whatever to downvote justifiable and logical questions or analysis whether you agree with them or not. Show some respect to the people who have contributed to this community more than most of you ever will.

@_date: 2015-11-05 12:57:48
Thanks. It is very nice of you to tell us that we are being manipulated through an account that seems to be 1 year old but strangely chose to make it's first comment today. As such, I suppose I shall conclude that there is indeed manipulation, but from blockstream, who seems keen to employ many 0 day accounts in the hope that the more they talk the more people will be persuaded.
I have news for you however. There is no manipulation, deception, lies, censorship, or any other method employable when the truth is self evident and in the self-interest of the participants. There is no clearer truth than that the 1mb limit is far too low and must be increased. That is why 80%, if not almost everyone, supports it's increase. As the supporters are clearly the majority by any poll or indication conducted, there is no reason for them to manipulate. As blockstream is very much in the minority however, they do seem to be keen to employ every possible manipulative tactic, including the tweet in question by Adam, presumably so that they can make themselves rich with their company at the expense of technological progress, innovation, and ultimately, freedom itself. 
However, I should think they are sufficiently intelligent to realise that their profit motives conflict with those of the users and unless they come up with a reasonable proposal in Hong Kong to the form of 5mb plus 30% yearly to be implemented immediately I should think they will realize that the supermajority of users will vote them out by moving their assets.

What. Didn't most of the miners sign a letter demanding 8mb? Arent the majority of miners voting for an increase of the blocksize to at least 32mb? Didn't majour prominent bitcoin companies sign a letter in support of Bip101, including majour miners like knc? Haven't other majour miners publicly supported bip101, like slush and antpool? Has not every single poll that has been conducted shown a support for bip101?
No, I am not mischaracterising. The facts and evidence is clear and they speak plainly. May I suggest that you are instead deluded within some crazy bubble where paranoia prevails as well as nonsense idealism with no pragtical considerations which if enforced would make bitcoin a tool of use only to criminals and therefore very vulnerable to being banned?
@_date: 2015-11-05 11:21:22
That has nothing to do with the extraordinary claim of Adam that the downvotes he is receiving are not from legitimate users or that it is from bought and stolen accounts. It is a speculative allegation given out as fact which makes him look paranoid and not grounded in reality so allowing him to dismiss the widely held view that blocks should not remain at 1mb.
As for the specific post you linked, that person clearly missed what Gavin was suggesting, that being forward-looking. As it was either a misunderstanding or an intentional conflation I do not see the harm in downvoting it so as to communicate to others that the poster is misunderstanding or intentionally misrepresenting. It is not too hard to click the plus button and I suspect that many people are actually drawn to the downvoted comments so that they can judge whether it was rightly downvoted or it was a contrarian view that they benefit from seeing.  
That is fundamentally different from outright censorship, which is what Adam's tweet seems to be supporting. Moreover, any censorship does not address vote manipulation. If this speculative and paranoid theory was correct, therefore, those downvotes should have continued during the great exodus when theymos, seemingly with your assistance, announced his censorship policy. Instead, all those who want to increase the transaction capacity and still chose to post were downvoted to hidden.
The truth of the matter is, as shown by every poll and every indication, that the vast majority of people support an increase to the transaction capacity and any downvotes, whether rightly or wrongly used, are mostly from legitimate users. That these legitimate users disagree with what Adam is saying should give him pause to think, rather than make him turn to conspiracy theories. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 12:14:07
I don't think it is every single dev. For example, Gavin and Jgarzick, two core committers, Hearn, and many other lesser known core devs, plus almost all wallet implementers. It is easier to divide them into those who work for blockstream (almost all against) with only the lead committer being "weakly against" and Peter Todd who is also against spv wallets and 0confirmed transactions being against, and almost everyone else being pro.

You're confusing me. You just said: "I'm not personally attached to 1MB as a cap myself." And replied with: "For the time being I'd lower the cap to 750KB but since it's not a massive difference we can keep it like this while other development continues."
That's a contradiction. You either want to keep the limit or don't want to keep the limit. You can't say, I'm not attached to 1mb, to then only reply, I want 1mb lol.
Did blockstream's talking point script not contain a more sophisticated reply which is able to simultaneously not be attached to 1mb while wanting 1mb? lol

BIP101 is giving the devs what they asked for in an open letter to the whole community: more time, because they wanted their two conferences and BIP101 is so abiding. As to the usefulness of BIP65, it seems to me to be rushed, before a decision has been taken, which thus makes it an underhanded tactic, on the one hand asking for more time, on the other hand pushing and rushing their settlement only ideology, which is not yet "accepted" by the community and thus the consensus, since no decision is made, as we abided by the devs request for more time with a deadline of December/Hong Kong conference, as per their own schedule.

Only money should be fixed limit. In a market, when demand goes up so does supply as it becomes more profitable to provide that product. If demand can go up without supply doing so that acts as in effect limiting demand for bitcoin transactions, and therefore bitcoins, which is a stupid proposition and I am not sure, save for handwaving subjective opinions, why anyone entertains this proposition without providing any analysis or evidence as for example Peter_r did.

BashCo, do you agree or not that around the time was created, the voting pattern in r/bitcoin changed? You are a mod here, therefore I should think frequent this place a lot. As such, if there was any such change, you would have noticed it. So, do you agree that during the time I mentioned above the 1mbiters if we can so define them who previously would be downvoted where instead upvoted and the supporters of increasing the limit were during that time downvoted?
If you do agree, then that clearly shows that the votes are from legitimate users as you did not ban any bots, who therefore could have continued manipulating, but users, who left the subreddit for a period in protest therefore did not express their opinion through voting.
If you don't agree that voting changed during that period then I guess I would have learned something about you.

Lightning is fundamentally flawed in that it doesn't solve the double spending problem but relies on some game theory that if you try to double spend me I'll double spend you first. As such, whether it is more secure than 0conf transactions is a subjective opinion and whether it is a write cache is too a subjective definition. 
In my view, transactions within lightning are a completely different system to bitcoin and are fundamentally insecure. Good enough for low value transactions, but in no way a good alternative for scaling proof of work which lightning does not utilise for within lightning transactions.  
@_date: 2015-11-05 14:47:55
What's the announcement? 
@_date: 2015-11-16 20:52:06
I'm talking about procedure. The devs can not sign an open letter asking the community to give them more time so that they can come up with a "consensus", set up a voluntary time table, chosen by themselves, with an implicit deadline of December, only weeks away, while at the same time completely bypass the consensus process and push their own ideology of settlement layers. 
Hal Finne and Nick Szabo may have said what you paraphrased, I have Satoshi on my side, and when I invoke him you accuse me of appealing to authority. This is about neither of those men however, it is about undermining a public debate, and underhandedly pushing a certain ideology, while at the same time asking for more time. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 12:57:38
I don't judge personalities. For all I know anyone can be corrupt or at least corruptible. Blockstream, for example, as shown with liquid, has a clear actual conflict of interest. Peter Todd, for example, has leaked conversations speaking to some ex cia guy or whatever intelligence it was, etc etc.
I judge arguments and we have been having those arguments for months now with, in my view, a clear consensus forming by a subermajority of users, miners, businesses and devs (-blockstream and the lead committer and peter todd) that the blocksize must be increased to at least 8mb immediately and then, personally, I'd add 30% yearly growth in line with past bandwith growth.
As for the devs that committ to XT, there are plenty, but the debate is not over yet and a decision has not yet been made by the whole community. I think everyone, in line with blockstream's and other devs open letter request, is giving them the opportunity to put forward a reasonable proposal in Hong Kong in December to be implemented immediately. I suggest to them, and hope, that they go with 5-6mb + 25-30% as I think that's the only proposal that everyone doesn't quite like but is fine to go with it. 
So we'll see what they offer and then the community can make a decision with most having publicly said that they will implement bip101 if consensus is not reached in December. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 11:56:27
Yeah. Litecoin can never be bitcoin. XT is just a different implementation which increases decentralisation in development by giving the people the choice to oust oligarchs. 
Moreover, XT as it is right now does not breach consensus. If it is ever implemented it would be with the support of a super majority of miners, users, businesses, basically almost everyone, at which point it would also not breach consensus. So his position is illogical. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 10:38:18
There is a conference next month with the aim of proposing solutions and reaching a "consensus" whatever that means. I think many "players" see that as some sort of deadline for core to do something. I suppose if they come up with some concrete announcement with broad agreement and reasonable timeline then cool, if not then most "players" have publicly stated they will patch core with bip101 or run Gavin's client by the second week of December. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 12:34:45
Well, I just gave you an example to disprove the conspiracy theory. When you banned many supporters of increasing the blocksize and was created gaining thousands of users within hours, almost only the small blockers stayed and posted here. Any post in favour of increasing the blocksize during the full on north korea time was downvoted to oblivion and those who want to maintain this crazy low limit were upvoted. If the majority of the votes is from bots, therefore, this voting pattern should have not shifted, but it did shift and did so 100% therefore showing that the vast majority of votes are by legitimate users.
Now of course there's some manipulation, by both sides I should think although I have only seen the 1mbers take blatant measures such as DDosing nodes and pools, creating hoax emails claiming to be from satoshi etc., but usually it is countered by legitimate user's voting behaviour especially when it makes it to the front page and is widely read. 
It is legitimate users who are downvoting adam as any grounded interpretation of the evidence shows and their downvoting should tell him and you quite a bit about their behaviour recently in stonewalling any progress to the point now where legitimate transactions are delayed for hours. 
As for consensus, everyone wants that, but we should not have one core dev or one self interested company veto progress to bitcoin's technology. That is dangerous for bitcoin itself and for those who work with bitcoin as if one person can veto then that makes that person a target for financial or physical corruption. 
For example, in regards to bitcoin and if we are to entertain speculative theories, it could be said that maintaining the blocksize to 1mb turns bitcoin into a fringe tool of use only to criminals (however fairly or unfairly so defined by law) who are willing to pay the high fees in the process eradicatin it's appeal to the mainstream as no legitimate users are left, therefore making it highly vulnerable to an outright ban. 
Now these individuals who profess all sorts of theories may of course genuinely hold them, but everyone has a price and an entity who wished to attack bitcoin from within may be willing to pay the price and they only need to do so for one person. That is why you do not judge the person, who can easily lie, but the arguments made and trust your own judgement after analysis of the reasons provided. 
Or, less speculatively, Adam Back's seemingly support for the censorship policy here, being the only prominent player in the bitcoin space to do so, clearly shows that he has a financial personal interest to keep bitcoin limited and less useful so that he can provide offchain solutions which do not utilise proof of work therefore are not bitcoin. It seems to me to be highly irrational to give him a veto on changes to the bitcoin protocol with your definition of consensus.

Yes, but they face the chicken and egg problem. Get all these transactions on a swiftcoin from get go and the miners will most certainly attack the very weak system. Wait for miners to adopt it first and that might work, but, at that point, its just another coin which may or may not be fully utilised by swift and have all these transactions at some point. Moreover, little miner revenue comes from transactions. Bitcoin for example currently has about 100k per day and that is hardly sufficient on its own to currently support the miner's investment. 
I suppose they could add some block reward to it, but what would be the point of all of this and why would anyone trust a closed system as opposed to the open bitcoin system especially as a swiftcoin would validate bitcoin and thus give it more of a boost and miner preference.
Sooner or later, I think, all these institutions will realise that the talk about the technology not the bitcoin is not quite correct because you can not just create another coin and expect everyone to flock to it as has been shown time and again, espcially if this new coin is closed system and proprietary as a swiftcoin would have to be.   
@_date: 2015-11-07 11:42:28


But it does. You say for example that this is your private property and therefore your right to do all you wish. That is not correct. You are squatting a brand name which does not belong to you, but to the whole community. This forum is a public space created mostly by the popularity of reddit itself and by the popularity of bitcoin. If a reddit user wants to go to the bitcoin subredit, for example, they naturally expect it to be found at r/bitcoin. Therefore, on a principled basis, although you are chief mod because that is how matters work in a centralised space, you are not the "owner" of this public space, but a moderator. Your job is to respond to the wishes of the people who use this subreddit, not to dictate to them. 
Therefore your actions do absolutely contradict your own principles of freedom because you are denying the people their freedom in a very violent way by taking aggressive and coercive action through censorship and banning.
It would be true to say that you are the owner and this is your private property if this subreddit was called something other than because in that case the popularity of that other subreddit would have been as a result of your own work. The popularity of this subreddit however is all due to the popularity of bitcoin itself and the fact that it is called r/bitcoin, a public brand which belongs to all and is not ownable as it is a decentralised creation by Satoshi given to us as a gift. As such, on a principled basis, it can not be said that you own such public name and space, but it is a commons.
Plus, if you cared about the price, I suppose you would have a little bit of intelligence to recognise that the recent crash coincided with the blockspace limit being hit. The traders started complaining in all spaces, so your opinion is in my view wrong, probably influenced by very ideological beliefs, but nothing can operate in extremist. We need pragmatism, not a coin which is only usable by criminals (and therefore very vulnerable to being outright banned) as they would be the only ones willing to pay the very high fees.

It is very much a smear, slander, a despicable insinuation and sickening. The fact is  that Satoshi did not leave after the CIA visit. He left before as far as public posts can tell. His last ever post made publicly was well before the CIA visit and chilling, referring to the mainstream article connecting bitcoin with wikileaks and proclaiming that the hornets nest was heading [bitcoin's] way. That he may have kept contact with Gavin is a different matter and who is to say he didn't continue keeping contact with Gavin through some different pseudoname or maybe even continued contributing though not as "satoshi".
He left, by any reasonable analysis of the facts, because he thought the hornets nest was headed his way. That some individuals now are turning what was a very tense and crucial time for bitcoin against Gavin, even though Gavin defused the tension, is frankly sickening.

I don't understand why this is being pushed so hard. Didn't the devs write an open letter asking the community to give them more time to achieve a consensus? Adopting this op is adopting a settlement layer philosophy, a decision that the community has not yet made because we were explicitly asked to wait until the Hong Kong conference.
It thus seems to me to be a very underhanded tactic to sign an open letter asking everyone to wait while at the same time pushing your settlement ideology which is highly contentious and has in no way any consensus. 
We decide how to scale first... then we implement it second.

I find it somewhat sickening that Gavin is smeared and slandered in such a casual way by individuals who clearly are either utterly paranoid, hold very extreme views by the standards of the super vast majority or are very new.
The situation in 2010-11 was quite tense around the world due to the wiki leaks. The USA government was running around trying to water quite a huge fire that had been started by Manning and the empire was basically going side by side like a drunk hitting anything on it's way. The suggestion by a prominent mainstream newspaper at the time that bitcoin, this very new thing, could be used to bypass the blockade against wikileaks could have brought a huge hammer on bitcoin just as it was born. Hence Satoshi's last post (paraphrasing): The hornets nest is coming our way. 
In that situation, if you receive an invitation to speak to the CIA as seemingly the most prominent member of bitcoin you would be beyond a fool to refuse for refusal itself raises huge suspicions which could have and probably would have brought Gavin and bitcoin huge troubles. 
It was not until late 2013 that people stopped speculating whether bitcoin would be banned in USA. That it wasn't, in my opinion, is in large part due to Gavin. While he had sole control over bitcoin at the time, his decision, even after meeting the CIA, was to decentralise development control by adding Gmaxwell (an individual who seems to be "bearish" on bitcoin and seems to think that bitcoin does not really work) as well as 3 other core developers. He furthermore went on to step down as Lead Developer, and now is finding it difficult to have a fairly simple and reasonable scaling solution implemented.
Gavin deserves the highest respect amongst all and any bitcoiner for his huge and crucial contribution to bitcoin at the time that it needed it the most. He, almost single  handedly, toiled away for years after Satoshi left, developed a core team, managed to get the regulators on our side and made possible the success that bitcoin enjoys today.

Adam, anyone with any level of intelligence can clearly see that your tweet smears the vast majority of bitcoin users and brushes them off as bots, shills, paid accounts, or whatever other insult you wish to throw at them. 
That shows a level of very low professionalism from yourself and informs anyone who is paying attention that you do not care at all about the concerns expressed by the vast majority of users, the vast majority of highly prominent bitcoin businesses, huge miners such as kncminers, antpool and slush, as well as many bitcoin developers, including core developers, and the majority of wallet developers.
To brush them off so publicly as manipulated paid shills or bots by... what, the government? banks? shows a very poor level of judgement, and high level of paranoia, as well as raising questions not only about the factual apparent financial conflict, but actual financial conflict.
In those circumstances, perhaps you can make public the business plan you showed to VCs to raise your millions so that we can be assured that there is no actual conflict of interest between blockstream and bitcoin?

Penetration testers produce some report and provide it to those who can take it on board and code some solution. They do not go around shouting about weakness that can be done nothing about or takes quite some time to fix. He is not assisting anyone by publicising flaws everyone knows about and worse making tools available to exploit such flaws that take time to resolve. Instead, he is aiding those who wish harm. This can be seen by his recent attempts to persuade f2pool to implement full rbf, in secret, so that we did not even know about it until some real and useful penetration testing vigilant eyes found out about it. 
Moreover, where is the penetration testing in shouting about selling all his bitcoins at an extremely sensitive time, when real friends of bitcoin were trying to come up with solutions, he just goes on to the public shouting about the sky falling.

Lmao. Gavin was given the rains by satoshi. He alone worked on core for years and formed the core dev team that now exists.

To say he has committed nothing over some arbitrary time line as if to somehow show that he, what, knows nothing?, is a self interested argument made by those who profit financially from keeping the blocksize as small as possible so that they can sell their own products for a handsome fee, like liquid.

It is pretty obvious, in my view, that the compromise should be 4mb plus 20-25% yearly growth in line with bandwith growth projections. I have given higher numbers before because I expected the counteroffer to be lower, thus reach at the middle with those numbers. It isn't a perfect solution for anyone, of course. 4mb may seem too low to start with, as well as 25% yearly growth, on the other side it may seem too high, but I honestly think that besides an extremist tiny minority who would not agree to increasing the blocksize at all, everyone else can find it acceptable and go along with it.
At this stage, I would accept nothing less and I do not think, for me personally, those numbers can be further negotiated by any mb or %. It's what should have been agreed ages ago through an open negotiation process sort of like this:  
Just do it and get this over with. The users demand it, the businesses, the traders who almost crashed the price to nothing once we hit the limit two days ago, the miners, practically everyone and I should think that blockstream is sufficiently smart to see the almost unanimous demand for an immediate solution along the lines I suggested above. Anything less strongly places their motives in question such as this apparent post by pieter supporting bigger blocks: 
who for some reason seems to have suddenly changed his mind.
Adam, and I say it will all due respect, you need to show this community some real good faith to overcome the many acts and statements that have been made by yourself which strongly suggest, in my personal opinion, that blockstream has an interest in cripling bitcoin so that it can offer its own solutions. The only way you can do so, in my view, is to come up with a real proposal, in line with the views of the majority, perhaps along the lines I suggested, to be implemented immediately.  Nothing else will do.

If Gavin is allowed to be so easily smeared without protestation then the only viable option is to smear the seemingly "alternative", although I do not think it is a smear. It is my reasonable opinion based on some facts that Gmaxwell is bearish on bitcoin. Of course my opinion could be wrong and I welcome corrections, but I think my opinion is on a different level from what can be classified as a conspiracy theory, unlike op.
We have two visions here, and this is the fundamental issue. We can all be civilised, engage in reasonable debate with some humility and respect for each other's opinions, or we can engage in a them and us mentality.
The visions are, from what I see, on one hand that bitcoin is simply a brilliant and genius technological innovation which allows for cheap and quick value transfer in a decentralised way in the process returning power to the people and users on one hand plus other benefits.
On the other hand it seems to me that some consider bitcoin to be a politicised weapon towards an idealised world of no government and no banks where governments/regulators/agencies are seen as pure evil and any attempt to appeal to the middle centre ground is treason with those who hold a different opinion denounced, banned, censored, smeared and bannished while not recognising that such opinions are in the very extreme minority and have almost no public support. 
I appreciate the arguments made by those who wish to politicise bitcoin, but I find them not practical. This is simply my provisional opinion which probably will change, but I see bitcoin as primarily a technological innovation which does and must work within the current structures for it alone is in no way sufficient to solve the more entrenched and intractable political structures and problems which go beyond cheap and quick value transfer in a decentralised way. 
My basic conclusion is that bitcoin is sufficiently revolutionary in many aspects without the need to add confrontational rhetoric against the government and I find attempts to banish any co-operation with the law of the land (which we have to abide whether we want to or not) as aiding criminals (whether rightly or wrongly so defined), fostering scammers and perpetuating a culture of amateurism leading to huge bitcoin thefts.
Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous. It can with some skill be fully anonymous. There is no need for teenagers to flout it at the face of the vast majority which cares not for it. The "criminals" will do what they do, but not giving them cover and being seen as helping to stop them is just good PR.

It is required for lightning to function. I am surprised it has been merged however even though there appears to be no consensus that this should be deployed as a soft fork due to the many disadvantages that soft forks have as we saw with BIP66. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 17:36:30
Very hard to spur nodes up! In fact XT has some 600 nodes, so those nodes who reject the 51% of miners are forked too. 
You have no leg standing if your definition of consensus is that of the protocol, basically 51% mining power. However you told us along with gmax for months on end that there MUST be developer consensus for changed to be made. There is NO consensus for CLTV to be merged via a soft fork and for extremely good reasons. BIP66 was a shambles that placed many people's hard earned money in extreme danger. So I am surprised that very legitimate concerns have been brushed off without providing any good explanation. Specifically, the deception towards the non upgraded nodes, turning them in effect into SPV wallets and the real dangers of money loss during the soft fork as has happened in the past.

That's cool mate. I'm not going to argue with someone who clearly does not acknowledge facts as shown by the easily found evidence that most miners did in fact sign support for 8mb, in blood so to metaphorically speak. 
If such obvious fact is thus miscarachterized one is left wondering of the people who chose to do so. Who fully refrain from showing any good will, who so are keen to use censorship, ddosing of nodes, ddosing of pools, faking of satoshi's email.

How does it achieve such infinine number of transactions without proof of work to confirm no double spending and without it being centralised? If it can do so then why don't we all just replace bitcoin with lightning?
@_date: 2015-10-13 18:08:21
I think you are talking about two different aspects here. The interaction between lightning and the blockchain and then transactions solely contained within the lightning network. 
As far as the interaction between lightning and blockchain all that happens is that your onchain coin is frozen for a period of time, that is you can not use it to transact. There is no transaction there, no double spending, nothing at all happens there except that you are not able to use it. That is so that it can be used as collateral on lightning.
Once your frozen bitcoin is collaterised, the collaterised drivative can be used to transact on lightning. From this point onwards there is no longer any interaction with the blockchain until settlement as transactions happen solely within lightning.
We are told that such within lightning transactions are instant, decentralised, and can not be double spent. How is that possible without proof of work? They must be either double spendable or not decentralised and with lightning it is the latter. It uses centralised clearing hubs which approve transactions. Therefore to suggest it as an alternative to scaling proof of work when it is a completely different and centralised thing is highly deceptive.

Miners lost thousands of dollars because of the BIP66 shambles and it could have been worse. Who is to say this time it won't be far worse and actual users lose their hard earned savings? You are being reckless with our money when there is no reason for it whatever and a hardfork can easily be deployed.
As for Hearn not writing consensus code, neither do you and a reasonable objection on technical grounds which has quite a bit of developer support as seen on the mailing list should not be brushed off by such unapointed requirement as writes consensus code or does not. Next step you will be issuing licenses as to who is a developer I take it as well as write a full code of rules, perhaps maybe even institute a board to "enforce" these rules. I suppose then we can all be done with calling bitcoin decentralised and recognise you as the ruler of us all.

It is very nice of them to continue having no discussion whatever of scalability while the Hong Kong conference, for which they pleaded in an open letter, is only weeks away.
Plus, these meetings seem to me to be very comittee like, with the same participants all the time, thus, since there are no new participants, suggesting some glass ceiling somewhere, and with dictats of operations as per the comittees rulings.
But then, maybe I'm fooling myself. They discussing replace by fee, which means no 0 confirmations, which means a silent decision that they have ruled we ought to go the settlement layer way. I guess they can't face the light of day with an explicit, white paper style statement like satoshi's peer to peer cash, of how this unproven settlement system would work and it's effects on security, decentralisation, censorability, etc.
Why then they plead for more time for their Hong Kong conference? 
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:22:36
The sole reason for the existence of proof of work is to make it impossible to copy a digit therefore preventing double spends through confirmations. Lightning transactions are transfers of online digits and it is claimed that such transfers can be instant (no confirmation) non double spendable and do not require proof of work. If that is possible in a decentralised way then we no longer need proof of work. So how does lightning achieve it without compromising the decentralised nature of proof of work?

Happy Cake Day btw
We can estimate based on the fact that MT Gox had 150k people when it went bust a year ago. 
MT Gox was already dying at that point and had been since April 2013, so it probably had around 20% marketshare. I'd think that, judging by the increase of this sub's users - even though the numbers can be gamed there are 1k users here most of the time which is comparable to other 150k users subreddits so most of them are real individual people I would think - I'd think the number of users has increased somewhat since then. 
So if gox was 150k people at 20% share, then all exchanges are around a million. Add a bit more for online wallets and some growth, subtract a bit for some users having an account in different exchanges wallets, we end up with a conservative estimate of I'd think 1.5 million and on the more optimistic estimate about 3 million.

Bruce, there is no shortage of people who can provide all those government agencies with all the technical assistance they need to figure out how to follow the money with or without any bitcoiner's co-operation. They managed it with Schrem, for example, Ulbritch, Shavers, etc. Whether you or I think their actions are moral or immoral is a political issue which should be followed through political means, by lobbying law makers, lobbying the public opinion and more effectively by technical means.  
The co-operation or lack of it of the bitcoin companies therefore has little if any effect on the powers and abilities of law enforcement except for to allow bitcoiners to have their voice heard.
Gavin seems to have chosen to engage the regulators and law enforcement from the beginning and it seems to me that his strategy has to a great extent worked. Bitcoin is not banned in the west (it could have been), instead it is now almost respectable and the public opinion, it seems to me, is slowly shifting from the wild west days of amateur run exchanges and constant scams and thefts to a safer, more professional environment.
It is the job of law agencies to enforce the law whether we agree with it or not and they do not lack the resources or technical means to so enforce it as we have seen with or without our assistance. So why not allow ourselves the opportunity to be heard through some formal channels ala the alliance and give our views when they will do what they wish/have to do anyway?

I profess no judgment on your views, on their rightness or wrongness, truth or fiction.
Bitcoin is necessarily limited in what it is. It concerns money, and only the limited aspect of money issuing. It does not for example speak of money manipulation, i.e. holding 100k bitcoin can easily allow you to manipulate money supply and demand, it does not speak of lending of course, it does not speak of oligarchy which is simply individuals having too much money, it does not speak of government and governance which was founded at a time when money was gold, limited in issuance as much as bitcoin is, and bitcoin can be taxed as any other money.
Bitcoin servers a very limited, though hugely important and revolutionary, aspect only. It's not a blue/red/green pill, its not a solution bullet. It's simply a profound technological innovation which allows for cheaper and faster value transfers in a peer to peer decentralised way (though we will see how long that will last with some bitcoin developers refusal to scale proof of work and demands for us all to use lightning which does not even solve the double spending problem). 
My simple point is that bitcoin is limited and in it's limited way it's revolutionary implications are sufficiently profound to not need the over the top rhetoric of utopian dreams of no governance which is a completely different issue from bitcoin. Bitcoin does not deal with the wider political structures of today's legal paradigms, but in only limited ways. 
So conflating utopian dreams with what the vast majority can see as simply a technological improvement, which it undeniably is, does no justice to it's technological innovations and advancement and if people here do not with to see or acknowledge that then the wider society to whom we have brought this technology will simply sideline us and use it as they see fit for it is afteral open source.

Maaku, can you clarify for everyone what do hubs do exactly in a simple language? My understanding is that the btc are collateralized and then used as ious until settlement. What prevents a hub from double spending the ious, from claiming it has more ious than it does, from creating fake ious etc.

And here we see the second stage of authoritarians taking full control over bitcoin's development. They blame Gavin of wanting a coup, but Gavin controls the core repository, he could remove them all if he wished a coup - furthermore he was lead dev and gave that up by free choice. No, the authoritarians are projecting and they are the ones engaged in a coup. Now they'll move to remove Hearn and Gavin from development, perhaps garzick soon to follow, and by so doing create an atmosphere of fear whereby disagreeing with blockstream et al means being ostracised.
The silent majority are looking on in disgust and following the miner's confusion with bip100 feel somewhat powerless as central control is enacted on bitcoin which is severely damaging confidence in bitcoin's decentralised nature.
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:47:15
It isn't too hard to explain a simple concept. The fact of the matter is that you can not have non double spendable transactions without proof of work because if you can we'll replace proof of work in a beat. That lightning is based on bitcoin does not change the fact that transactions happen on lightning that are not secured by proof of work therefore such transactions go through a centralised entity and all the problems that go with it.

I like it how you argue it is an argument from authority to say that Gavin has successfully led this project for years, formed the current dev team, gave commit access to 4 of them and even leadership to one of them, has written some 200k lines of code on core and was entrusted by Satoshi, to then go on to use an argument from authority by saying:
"A different Coinbase member, Charlie Lee, who has actual experience with decentralized cryptocurrency (being a founder of Litecoin) has strongly advocated against BIP 101, and against XT. Charlie also attended Scaling Bitcoin conference...
I wonder who has more credibility in the debate?"
It is not about credibility, authority, personalities, etc. It is about arguments and we have heard all the arguments over many months and beaten them to death. After hearing all that was to be said the supermajority of users, miners, businesses, wallet developers etc have concluded that the blocksize must be raised in a bip101 fashion. 
Now maybe not start at 8mb doubling every two years, perhaps start at 5 or 6mb increasing by 30%. I'd be down with that. But 2mb in 2 years? Or flexicap which punishes miners if they want to increase the blocksize? Or the 2-4-8 which puzzlingly stops at 8 for no reason when everyone demands 8 right now? No, that is not where the consensus of the supermajority of miners, users, businesses and developers lays. 
We'll see what happens in Hong Kong. Hopefully blockstream will realise that the people (many, if not most of them quite technical, with some very technical, since most here are probably coders) have spoken and have passed judgement on all the arguments made and therefore come forward with a proposal of perhaps 5-6mb to start with and 30% to be implemented immediately. Otherwise, everyone should just move to bip101 as many have said will do and as that is the only reasonable proposal in my view and the view of the supermajority from what every indication can tell.

So, if it is a multisig, why does it need a sidechain? Can't we incorporate that technology into bitcoin by developing bitcoin's script system so as to make 0conf transactions safer rather than requiring a permissioned sidechain?
@_date: 2015-10-13 08:48:39


I think that's the definition of a permissioned blockchain. Someone decides who has access, as opposed to the open blockchain we have where anyone can take part without requiring any permission from anyone. 
I think a lot of people would be interested to know why they pay a fee to blockstream? Is this a centrally managed database or is it just a license fee or something else?
@_date: 2015-10-14 08:34:32
Some of his claim is true such as core devs employeed by blockstream censor discussion in the irc channel of 
Blockstream has hired many core developers who have huge connections and are moderators of most irc channels. Though there may be no money changing hands, the concentration of so much "authority" within one hierarchical and centralised entity does have an effect and when this is coupled with the censorship here at (which may be simply because of an affinity of the moderators here with blockstream employees or perhaps completely unrelated) it places blockstream in a huge position of power to such an extent that if this censorship continues it can be said that bitcoin is no longer decentralised, but controlled by you. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 12:36:51
Yes, so they would need to invest perhaps 2 billion to recreate bitcoin. What profit motivated reason would they have to do so when there is a free and tested alternative which is bitcoin itself?
Moreover, I don't think the technology is quite ready yet for huge institutions like swift to use it internally or externally at any significant scale. 
If they would listen to my advice, I would suggest they follow IBM and the other tech giants back in the day who chose to support the linux development and then adopted it for their own profit motivated use and now can freely use linux on servers, phones etc.
Swift, likewise, can become some sort of sponser, provide assistance, etc. to the core development and improve the system to the point where it is no longer in an experimental stage, but ready for full utilisation. 
Or they can start their own bitcoin, which would be a complete waste of money and resources as their system would require huge expenditure on both the initial investment and then the maintainance of the mining, the electricity, the coding development etc. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 09:11:00
Bitcoin is programmable money. Maybe someone needs to find out how to use the inbuilt script system so that a bitcoin address is ordered to : "if withdraw more than 100, then require second signature." Thus making most withdrawals instant but adding more security for large withdrawals.

That I must want a bitcoin and get a bitcoin is not permission. I require no one's permission to mine a bitcoin, nor anyone's permission as to who I send it to. That's as permissionless as it gets. With liquid someone must grant you access to the protocol and you can transfer only between approved participants which is pretty much the definition of permissioned so I am not sure what means by his strong denial that liquid is permissioned.   
@_date: 2015-11-16 20:40:16
Of course it has an effect. Lightning is used as the main alternative to scaling proof of work, we are told we can use proof of work as settlement and lightning as an ofchain/bitcoin hyprid to scale.
It sounds to me as highly hypocritical that we are asked to wait until December to make a choice, while at the same time pushing the settlement ideology, which is highly controversial and in no way has any consensus. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:34:18
Where is the contract? A wishes to transfer to B - that's all to it. Where is the enforcement? The blockchain confirms no double spends through proof of work. Lightning confirms it how? You can through script lock a transaction, but while locked the transaction does not happen and once it does happen you need to make sure it is not a double spend. How do you make sure it is not a double spend without a centralised entity and without proof of work?

There is nothing we can do about that and they probably are already engaging in it as far as entry points are concerned. There is no principled reason why, as far as the law of the land is concerned, created through the current system (and if you do not like the law or system then you can and should argue against it through political means, by lobbying law makers and/or lobbying public opinion), there is no reason why bitcoin transactions as far as entry points are concerned should be exempt from the current legal paradigm.
Of course, philosophically, we perhaps may not like it, but unless some sort of reasonable alternative is proposed then practically there is little if any choice. They have the technical and practical means to enforce their will on entry points and the vast public opinion seems to side with them on the specific matters we are considering, i.e. aml/kyc etc.
The issue is the protocol and they seem to have no desire whatever to alter or compel (I mean they can't, but they have not even tried so far) the alteration of the protocol to enact tracking means within bitcoin itself which I do not think is even possible on a technical level or practical level as bitcoin is global and they have no jurisdiction over non - USA miners who may decide to not engage.
So, it's a non issue really. They want to control the entry points, they were always going to do so, they can compel compliance of entry point companies, nothing we can do about it, so we may at least lobby them and have them hear our voice.
This childish talk of co-operating with the "enemy" however, of LE being devil incarnate, etc, is fine in informal settings, but not as an actual "formal" policy when interacting with outside bodies who may fundamentally not understand the inner culture and may even find the more extreme elements, such as an idolised utopian world of no government, repulsive.

That makes no sense. How is that consensus when you explicitly do not agree with the new rules, but comply with them anyway?

It's not accusations. It is request for information in the absence of which I have no choice but to form my opinion from things that you and some others from blockstream have said or the general way acted. Obviously, that is subjective, hence why I am asking for facts. Specifically, what promise was made to the investors in regards to expected returns, revenue short term, long term, and how are such intended returns to be achieved?
I've heard it said for example that it is by paid consulting, one way which we have seen from liquid whereby you are paid a certain fee from the participating exchanges to participate for the service of exchanging coins between them instantly. Such services could be provided by the blockchain to a high degree, although of course not absolutely secure degree, by improving on 0 confirmed transactions through for example the double spending alert relay coded by Gavin. Some from blockstream however seem to be against 0 confirmed transactions on blockchain (while offering such 0 confirmed transactions as a feature for a paid fee to their clients) and are even, allegedly, moving towards not supporting SPV wallets. 
With this service it seems to me that there is actual conflict of interest in that blockstream profits from 0 confirmed transactions not being improved and blockspace becoming limited and fees higher so that it makes more sense to use liquid or some other offchain service provided for a fee. 
So there is plenty of evidence there to show a conflict. That is why I think it would benefit all if you can provide the actual business plan given to the VCs, without the technical or any propriety information, so that we can see the promises that were made and what convinced them to provide millions to an entity that had no product at the time as well as how the returns on those investments are to be achieved in a detailed manner with redactions of patentable information or without since I think we were told you were going to open source everything.

The opening and closing of a channel is an onchain transaction which is indeed secured by proof of work, is decentralised and can not be double spent. My question is in regards to the transactions that happen after that. Once the bitcoins are in the channel, the remainder of the transactions are no longer secured by proof of work. Therefore, how can these transactions happen in a non double spendable and decentralised way? They can't. That's why you need hubs to act as a centralised clearing system with all of it's problems. If someone can show me a decentralised non double spendable system without proof of work as lightning claims to be then we can just replace bitcoin's proof of work with this new genius system. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:47:26
In plain bitcoin the other side can't double spend me. In lightning however they can and I need to take some action to stop them from doing so.

Is it necessary to keep funds on hot wallets though? Can't customers wait for say 1 day to withdraw their btc, rather than instant as it is currently, thus allowing for some cold or semi cold system limiting these thefts? 
@_date: 2015-10-17 14:18:03
The lightning network is a completely different system to bitcoin as it allows censorship, it has no privacy at all as hubs know who is paying who how much and it's "solution" to the double spending problem is not a solution at all but a game incentive theory whereby if you try to double spend me, I'll double spend you first, which means that, in my opinion, lightning is fundamentally insecure. As such I do not think it can in any way be considered an alternative to scaling proof of work. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 18:57:04
Erm... he suggested how it could work lol
@_date: 2015-10-24 15:53:13
That sort of thing is beyond my paygrade, but in general terms one benefit, as I said, is that they hear our voice, a second and perhaps more important benefit is that we are seen as NOT harbouring/protecting/aiding/ "criminals" (whether rightly or wrongly so defined) and we are seen as law abiding thus perhaps allowing bitcoin to shake off it's current image of wild west where constant scams and thefts go unpunished.
Now, of course, as far as the protocol itself is concerned, there is little that can be done about these things in practice as with a little bit of mixing one can gain some good privacy and there may be other innovations in that aspect. They may and do control entry points, such as exchanges, but they can not and I do not think they wish to exercise any power over the protocol itself and I think this policy decision to not even attempt was part of lobbying efforts.
So, I see no harm in co-operating (not least because we can be compelled to if we do not voluntarily do so). It's just good PR for bitcoin. 
I can not see why you are taking a combative attitude however, seemingly seeing "them" as some sort of threat, as some sort of entity with no accountability, as "thugs". All of which may be fair to be stated in many informal contexts, but there is no reason to ask for the hammer to come down when they have shown no concrete mal-intention towards bitcoin the protocol nor have taken any coercive action to the level of combative attitude.

Hardforks don't either. As long as you have 51% of the mining power the longer chain prevails. So, what's your point exactly? Is it that there is no such thing as "consensus" save for what is the longest chain or is it that apparently some authority determines what needs and doesn't need consensus?

Hey maaku7. I've had a read about it now and to me it seems that lightning is fatally flawed in that it doesn't actually resolve the double spending problem but only has a game theory incentive. Specifically:
"We can revoke the old transaction: you simply give me the temporary private key you used for that transaction. Weird, I know (and that’s why you had to generate a temporary address for it). Now, if you were ever to sign and publish that old transaction, I can spend my $9.99 straight away, and create a transaction using your key and my key to spend your 1c. Your transaction (1a below) which could spend that 1c output is timelocked, so I’ll definitely get my 1c transaction into the blockchain first (and the paper uses a timelock of 40 days, not 1)." 
However, for you to be able to double spend the attacker you must still have this private key which may have been shared quite some time ago, may have been lost, may have been corrupted, or indeed the victim may have died or the victim is technically illiterate to know how to double spend back, etc.

Of course fiat currencies have deflation as well. For example the FED might print less than it did before perhaps leading to the value of money to go up. 
However, the current economic system is fundamentally inflationary  because it is based on debt. If the FED stopped printing money necessarily people would not be able to pay their debt because more is owed than there are units of account leading to a banking collapse. 
The FED can try and counter this deflation it created by printing, but the FED is not God. They can't know how much units of account there should be in the system therefore the FEDs intervention distorts the optimal allocation of resources.

To continue with the car analogy, although it is not a "need", i.e. it is not necessary, it is almost necessary, especially if you have no means of public transport. 
Of course you can choose whether to have a car or otherwise, or whether to use the bitbank's service or otherwise, but the bitbank's service, like the car, is very convenient, so you would probably use it. 
Most people would probably use a bank to safely store their coins - takes away the hassle from hackers, etc. I would think for example that a bitcard would be quite convenient. If I wanted to withdraw some bitcoins into cash, I could just go to the atm. I could also be rewarded with interest if I give my coins to the bank to safely store as the bank could then lend it. 
They would need to adapt of course, but I do not see bitcoins killing banks. They might become smaller, less profitable, a bit like 100 years ago rather than today, but even during the gold standard banks were central to the economy. They are in the business of lending money which I would think would always be needed even if to a lesser extent than now.

That is lunacy to the extreme thus the rest of the dystopia is not based on any or even a small part of practical real reality.
These things happen slowly not overnight. As such, there would be no hyper inflation. As for taxation, bitcoins still need to come to you from somewhere.

What does Bitcoin is a new way of employing existent money in transactions exactly mean and how is a new way of employing existing money any different from a new currency or just money?
To me it seems that the author is saying the bitcoins is basically a store of value. It can be converted into fiat, therefore it is a new way of employing money.
Couldn't the same be said about fiat however? Fiat is merely a new way of employing gold. Fiat merely stores the value of gold, therefore it is only a new way of employing gold.
As such, what the author seems to be saying is that only gold is money and what everyone calls money or currency is not money or currency but..., well, I didn't understand that part of what it exactly is.

Its nice to see how your replies get more and more one sentence as each quote progresses.
I don't find your response to my argument that we came from the dark ages to the roaring twenties based on a deflationary currency, - i.e. we spent plenty - satisfactory. I have not made the analysis but since you are arguing economics is about empricisims, what percentage owned their homes in 1920 and what percentage does now, how many business were created then and how many are now? 
I think there is an argument to be had as to whether it is better to hand over trillions to banks and in the process bankrupting countries rather than letting banks go bankrupt. This has nothing to do with whether the currency is inflationary or deflationary though. There was a huge bank crises in 1930 - just as in 2008. Banks collapsed. That brings any economy to its knees regardless of whether the currency is deflationary or inflationary. The solution in 2008 was to save the banks so we got away with only a recession rather than a depression. In 1930 they chose to not save the banks so the economy became depressed and businesses failed - just as in 2008 - again nothing to do with the deflationary or inflationary nature of the currency and everything to do with a banking collapse.
Finally dollar unbaked by gold has not been around for more than even 40 years. Its hardly a settled matter. The debate actually has just begun. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:07:45
Well from my understanding you've got to have either inflation or deflation. Is it possible for all the economic factors to so precisely constantly align with the amount of money in circulation? 
As such, again Hayek: "It is, however, rather doubtful whether, from a long-term point of view, deflation is really more harmful than inflation"
I don't understand how bitcoins are not deflationary by the way. Sure prices may also decrease, but since we don't live in a perfect world and thus it is unlikely that the increase in the value of money = precisely the decrease in the value of goods/services, we get deflation as opposed to the opposite. Although there may be times of inflation, but the general trend would be slight deflation I would think. As opposed to the current monetary policy which is slightly inflationary.

Those are good questions which need to be clarified and probably will be in due course. For now, wouldn't it simply be the case of considering the corresponding value of bitcoins in dollars and paying whatever the business tax rate is on that converted dollar sum? 
Otherwise, if a business had to consider capital gains, then they would need to keep a record of each sale in bitcoins, the date, how much the value has changed which for a business may mean an accounting record of each day's sales which would probably be a red tape night mare. Or do businesses do this anyway?

So  the letters on a book have meaning then only if we turn them into words and communicate through them. Would you then say that letters, i.e. a b c d by itself are useless? If they are useful it is only to create words and words are useful because you can communicate with them. So equly a bitcoin is useful to buy things with it and you want to buy things with it to trade. This in turn gives it value.
Obviously, if no one accepts bitcoins in exchange for anything it does not have value. Same as if no one accepted a b and c to create these words a b and c would be useless.

Right. So I am in the UK. I have a bank account with the Bitbank. First of all, I need to put some money into this account. How do I do that? 
Secondly I want to buy bitcoins. So I got £1,000 in it. Now I want to buy bitcoins. Lets say mt.gox has an account at bitbank too. How do I buy the bitcoins? Do I just send my $1,000 to mt's bitaccount? If so, how is anything different from the way it happens now?
I think a trick that you might have missed is that each exchange has a centralised point. Mt basically sells and buys bitcoins from traders. So, unless the bank becomes an exchange as well, I do not see how it could solve the problem of money laundering concerns.

It's hard to pay in bitcoins right now when the price goes from 30 to 260 and then down to 70 and then 120 dollars all within one month.
I mean, if your work is worth say $2,000. How many bitcoins should the contractor pay? If you say, however much it is worth in bitcoins right now, what if he thinks bitcoins are overvalued right now and will go down? What if he thinks they are undervalued and they will go up? So basically, the contractor would need to be a very high risk investor first and a contractor second as a bonus.

I do not see how you can disentangle, as an example, the effect of the invention of the computer from the effect of the monetary policy on median income. 
As for employment, of course inflation is going to cause higher temporary employment but it is temporary and the correction is worse than otherwise according to Hayek anyway. 


As you know, this was while the dollar was gold backed. The dollar stopped being backed by gold in the 70s, some 40 years after the Great Depression. The Government then had the means to fight it. It simply needed to spend more. 
As for 07/08 it is not clear what stopped it from tuning into a severe depression. Government spent a lot, saved the banks, and printed money. Only the money printing is relevant to the argument of fiat or hard currency and it can be argued that such money printing was not necessary and it may cause much more problems than it temporarily alleviated. 


The current conservative centre right government of the UK and Republicans in US. 


Of course. The free market is better placed to decide how much tomatoes or my wage should be than the FED. If my wage is too low, then sure the government can help through redistribution of taxes. 
Banks are not the "the free market" though so banks of course should be regulated, but it isn't clear what caused 07/08.  A housing bubble, too much borrowing, artificial and temporary employment caused by inflation etc.

@_date: 2013-04-15 17:43:40
What I mean in that first paragraph is that the rise of median income was not necessarily because of an inflationary monetary policy. If you can prove why median incomes have risen exactly, i.e. to what extent they have risen because of inventions, such as computers and other inventions and advancements, and to what extent because of inflationary policy, then sure we can say an inflationary or deflationary policy is better. I do not see how you can do that though short of simply guessing. 


I think we are confusing things a bit. You seem to be arguing that the reason why we had a Great Depression is because we had a hard currency. Without this hard currency we would have not had a Great Depression.
I am arguing that is not correct. All that was needed to stave off the Great Depression was to counter deflation with inflation. As you can have inflation even though you have a hard currency, whether America had a hard currency during the 30s or it had fiat is irrelevant. The government failed to step in and spends loads of money which, if in a sufficient amount, would have caused inflation. The government further compounded this mistake by making other monetary or otherwise policy mistakes. That's what made the Depression great not the fact that the dollar was backed by gold.
Now, printing money might make the causing of inflation to counteract depression even easier. As you say, we'll see what future economical analysis state as to the effect of creating money had during 07 - 11 and what effects it will have. To say one way or another though as far as fiat or hard currency is concerned, we'd need another 30s or 07/08 situation where the state takes all the steps as in 07/08 save for printing or creating money. 
As to the free market, the market does not seem that free to me if the state can decide to inflate or deflate everyone's wages and prices and by how much. Such inflation or deflation wouldn't easily be possible with a hard currency rather than fiat.  
By the way, why are you in this forum or why are you putting money into bitcoins if you think its nature as a hard currency means it is doomed?

I do not think any of them is a criminal. I do not think even Marxs was a criminal. They have opinions, they have theories, they have analysis, they probably are aiming for everyone to be as prosperous and as happy as possible. 
That does not make them right though. There is no proof that a slightly overall inflationary monetary system is better than the opposite. Both inflation and deflation have their upside and downside. Which you think is better depends on your political ideology. 
If you want a bigger and a more powerful government which can distort the market by deciding that everyone's wages should go up or down, if you want to encourage prolific borrowing, etc., you like inflation and you voted Democrat and you do not want government spending to be cut right now, but instead you think the government should borrow even more than it is because the interest rates are historically low. 
If you want a smaller government and for the worker and employer to decide how much the wage should be and you want the market to be left alone and decide prices rather than the state to increase or decrease them all at once, you want to reward savers, etc, you probably voted republican and want to cut spending to deal with the debt problem.

My argument is that since we have progressed leaps and bounds people have spent plenty of money in a deflationary currency so to say that deflation is bad because people with save money rather than spend it thus in the process kill the economy is incorrect.
In regards to 1930/2008 I think you are confusing yourself. One moment it is a legislative problems, the next moment the Federal Reserve took action. Which is it? Did the banks in 2008 not go bankrupt because we gave them billions or trillions - so nothing to do with the nature of the currency - or was it because the Federal Reserve took action? I think it was the former and maybe to a much lesser extent the latter.

"you gain more from saving than [borrowing".
Which is good. Saving has no adverse effects on an individual's wealth. They need to delay gratification, so of course not everyone is going to save, but in my opinion saving is better than borrowing. Borrowing keeps the poor poor - or makes them poorer, and keeps the rich rich - or makes them richer.
You and all these economists speak as if we have always had fiat currency backed by nothing. I.e. many argue no one is going to invest  - spend - because more can be purchased later. Yet in the previous 1000 years people spent plenty of money although the currency was deflationary. 
You mention Keynes but he has Hayek. To say that Deflation caused the depression misses the picture. Then, as in 2008, banks collapsed. Following the collapse then and in 2008 money became deflationary. The only difference is that in 2008 billions - maybe trillions - were given by each and every taxpayer to the banks free of charge no strings attached. Had the banks been allowed to collapse in 2008 as in 1930, however inflationary the currency, nothing would have been different from 1930. 
To summarise, just because some economists say so it does not make it so. Economics is not a science. We now have a great experiment. Deflationary bitcoins and inflationary fiats. We will see whether libertarians or liberals are right.

We've gone back full circle now it seems. Your argument was that hard currencies - i.e. gold, bitcoins - are bad because of deflation - and presumably you cite Keynes.
My argument is that deflation is better than inflation and I cite Hayek.
Which is right we may find out in 20, 30, 40 years time. I suspect, if nothing else, bitcoins - unless some much better hard virtual cryptocurrency like it comes long - will be at least a safe heaven in that time frame like gold and may be way more than that.

Just because there can be periods of deflation or the fed can decide to fight inflation or even have a deflationary target of for example -2%, that does not mean that the current economic system we have is not inflationary. It is. The Feds target for example is for inflation to be at 2%.
I think I gave a good argument as to why people - and by people I mean businesses, governments, the whole economy basically - would not be able to pay their debt. That is because the amount the economy owes to each other is more than there are units of account.
Here is wikipedia:
"Worldwide debt levels are perhaps worth two or three years of GDP. GDP (at currency exchange rate) was $40 trillion during 2004. Debt levels may therefore be about $100 trillion"
And here wikipedia continues:
"As of November 17, 2011 the Federal Reserve reported that the U.S. dollar monetary base is $2,150,000,000,000. This is an increase of 28% in 2 years.[29] The monetary base is only one component of money supply, however. M2, the broadest measure of money supply, has increased from approximately $8.48 trillion to $9.61 trillion from November 2009 to October 2011, the latest month-data available. This is a 2-year increase in U.S. M2 of approximately 12.9%"
These facts, it is my argument, make the current monetary system fundamentally inflationary as it is necessary to continue to create new units of account if debts are to be paid back.

I do agree with you. The almost very last public sentence from Satoshi is somewhat chilling. That nothing happened does suggest that "they" whoever "they" are see more benefits than disadvantages to bitcoins.
After all, why should bitcoins be a threat to anybody? Obviously it is not going to replace the dollar any time soon, but even if it does, the dollar was pegged to gold for 200 years or so. I don't see why it would be a threat to the banks. They can just adopt the infrastructure and increase their profits by decreasing their cost of moving money.
I think everyone sees just how beneficial bitcoins is to humanity and the fact that it is an advancement which promises to make everyone better off, although, of course, some will loose.

It gives me a warning?
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:40:14
I don't think so. Firstly, it does not necessarily mean that bitcoins will only grow in value. Bitcoins may turn out to be just a niche and stabilise at something like $10.
Secondly, even if it does go up in value to say $10,000, there would be periods of inflation like the recent crash. During those times, preferable just before it, it would be smart for you to invest in dollars, that is sell the bitcoins. 
And Thirdly, although as a nobody you may have a high percentage of all bitcoins right now, if someone gave you a million for it you might sell them, therefore re-instating the current fiat pyramid.

Yes I understand that. Blockchain.info could open a uk bank account with another bank though rather than simply giving up because one UK bank - Barclay's - closed their account. They could try Nationwide or Co-op or even a credit union.

"The return to the gold standard is supported by many followers of the Austrian School of Economics, Objectivists, free-market libertarians, by strict constitutionalists in the United States and some supply-siders."
That seems like a hell of a lot of economists to me which support my position. As a bonus, one of them is Hayek who won a Nobel for his theory of how to best allocate resources.


Thankfully facts can't be distorted by leftist rhetoric. The indisputable fact is that we have had a deflationary currency for more than not. 
Moreover, you seem to completely ignore the perils of inflation. See for example Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Cyprus, and who knows next which was due to a misallocation of resources - i.e. too much borrowing - because of inflation and now those countries are in a depression. 
You can only print so much money until you become bankrupt as a nation.

That sounds quite paranois. If you aren't doing anything illegal then there is no reason to go underground. I mean, its not like 100 or 1000 people are doing this. Its tens if not hundreds of thousand, including celebs, so, I don't think anyone has any reason to fear.

Read Hayek, he can tell you much better than I. And Hayek isn't old, he died in 1992. He was a contemporary of Keynes. 


Lol, this is the we have never been at war with Eurasia argument.
Hayek is as mainstream as an economist can be. His ideas laid the foundations for everything Thatcher/Reagan did and much of what conservatives/republican stand for economically.
If you mean he is a fringe whako to the left, then Keynes is worse than Marx. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:05:37
You're right, parroting wasn't a good word choice. What I meant was that perhaps you have not considered the alternative economic theories to Kaynes, that is Hayek.
I did not say or imply that Kaynes is a whaco left. Maybe there was a miscommunication somewhere. Instead, it seems to me that you were implying that Hayeck was some whacko economist like Ron Paul - hence my reference to 1984 and the suggestion that you - and the left - seems to be arguing that everyone who thinks that a slightly deflationary monetary system is better than a slightly inflationary monetary system is a fringe and whacko - when of course that is not true - i.e. Hayek and conservatives/republicans. 
So if the left is going to call Hayek a whacko then Kaynes is a whacko and worse than Marxs lol. 
But yes, we are having a discussing about deflation and inflation in two other nested comments so
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:24:37
I haven't heard of any inflationary cryptocurrency though. I don't see what it's appeal would be since we have inflationary fiat.

Turtles all the way down. Debt needs to be paid with debt. If lets say a country has an economy of 1 million and 1 million and 1 thousand needs to be paid back, you need to borrow that 1,000 from somewhere, which in itself adds interest and so on. 
You may say but value is created. That is irrelevant. The unit of account is increased through debt. There is less unit of account currently than there is debt. Therefore more unit of accounts need to be created through debt to pay back the debt owned and so on. This is basically a stealth taxs which makes the government bigger and more powerful and enriches banks to the expense of everyone else. 
Moreover, this constant inflation at some point may become run away inflation. At the end of the day, a currency not backed by gold has been the policy for only 40 years which is a tiny timeframe.

Yet. 
He says the policy of printing money is temporary, but it has been 5 years now! You cant just contract the monetary base - which what stopping printing money would be - and expect the economy to not depress. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:25:51
Its not monopoly money he says. Does that mean the government is unlikely to ban bitcoins since in a way gives legitimacy to bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:45:48
Well, one big difference would be that you can't just print bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 23:40:11
Yeh. That's why I have $5 in flattr. I put in around $10 earlier in the month and exchanged 5 through satoshis, but the guy seems quite bussy right now. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:15:50
In an exchange like mt.gox all you need to prove though is that you deposited $100 dollars on the exchange which is quite easy with recent transactions. Once that has been deposited, the CC'er cant go back to the bank to say I did not receive bitcoins because he was not buying bitcoins to begin with but depositing 100 to mt.gox. So the argument that bitcoins are unrecoverable does not apply because you need to firstly deposit the 100 on the exchange and then buy bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:55:44
I see. So clearly there are two components. One is a bank account for each user. The other is the relationship between fiat and btc in the account. 
In regards to the latter, are you saying that the bank would basically be the one selling the bitcoins or buying the bitcoins from each individual user? So the same as an exchange except that individuals aren't trading with each other but they are trading with the bank?
I can see a lot of conflict of interest for the bank unless they peg their sell/buy order to mt gox. If they do, then that would be a super easy way to buy bitcoins which would mean that whoever sets up the system would make a lot of money.
How would you get the fiat into the bitcoin bank account though? If by SEPA or international wire or okdwalla etc, then why wouldn't I as a potential customer just send it to mt gox?

And their share price would go higher than Apple's. Wouldn't they be killing their own business though? Once people exchange enough money to bitcoins, they can then just send bitcoins, bypassing Western Union.

On a more serious note, depends on whether you are Canadian, German, Russian, British or American.
If American I think COinsetter is pretty easy. I am not American though so I am not speaking from experience.

So you can't yet use the system then?
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:38:04
I don't think I am understanding your proposal. So to be clear, you are suggesting that a bank account could be opened for each individual for the sole purpose of trading bitcoins. Then in order for these individuals to actually trade there would need to be an escrow system, sort of like localbitcoins?
If that is your suggestion, then why open a new bank account when you can just trade at localbitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:42:22
mt.gox is doing it and they seem to be profitable. It isn't decentralised, but I suppose a community exchange, even if not decentralised, would be better than a "distant" exchanger.

Ohh nice, where in Europe? Come to London Brits are starving for Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:48:41
But, if the value of the hard currency goes up prices go down. It isn't necessarily the case that a hard currency monetary system would always be deflationary. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:13:21


How can something be worth ten times more than there are money in the whole world?
What something is worth is determined by with how much money you are willing to depart for it. If you do not have 100 trillion dollars - which is how much everyone owes to everyone else, then the debt simply can't be paid back. So it is necessary to keep printing or creating new money. Hence a fundamentally inflationary monetary system. 
I don't think everything is doom and gloom. I just think that a hard currency like bitcoins is an improvement of the current system. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:23:37
but the guy with CC can also say I never bought that stock, or I never deposited on forex. CCs and charge backs weren't invented yesterday. Sure one or two may claim a charge back as they might do with forex trading but that's compensated but the profits made through more customers than otherwise. Its just part of business and I don't see why bitcoin exchanges are somehow special.

@_date: 2013-05-03 21:05:13
I think that sounds good, but I think that it would be even better if the bank was the exchange or runs an exchange as well because then they would minimise the risk of any fines by themselves complying with all the requirements rather than relying on the potential that whatever exchange they partner with does not comply with those rules.
I think there's probably money to be made there, if you have the money to invest. Sets you apart from all the other exchanges and gives you a prime mover advantage in being the first BitBank. BB ha - Trademarked - lol joking.
