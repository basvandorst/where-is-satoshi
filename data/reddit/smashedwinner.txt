And you're not so big
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:36:34
even technical people on the Internet aren't social media programming experts. and you need to be an expert to detect any backdoors or other malicious codes.

What happened?
You've requested a page on a website ( that is on the CloudFlare network. CloudFlare is currently unable to resolve your requested domain ( There are two potential causes of this:
Most likely: if the owner just signed up for CloudFlare it can take a few minutes for the website's information to be distributed to our global network.
Less likely: something is wrong with this site's configuration. Usually this happens when accounts have been signed up with a partner organization (e.g., a hosting provider) and the provider's DNS fails.

all the concerns you mentioned are not relevant for this presentation.
the kids said to use BitPay. They will not have to store any private keys, they will get paid immediately in USD and will not have to worry about BTC fluctuations, and there will be no wallet address for them to check a balance.

Can you confirm that accounts are safe and that internal infrastructure was not compromised?

How is bitcoin a system of subsidies? 
The miner choose to run their machines in exchange for mining rewards and transaction fees. No subsidies.

Snowden was a hero, not a criminal. How can a free country have so many secrets? 
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:27:38
I agree. But the topic of discussion has been what non-violent crimes deserve being locked in a small cage for a period of your life. 
Treason is an interesting one. However, if you expose an organisation or country for crimes against humanity, you probably dont deserve jail time. But, if you willingly enter into a contract (snowden agreed to the job, knowing what it would be like), and that contract includes secrecy, if you break secrecy you deserve to be penalized by that same contract for rules of breaking secrecy

he did not give us a bad name. He gave us a bright light of the future.
No one should have control over what you, yourself, want to put into your own body.
Coming from the South Side of Chicago, i praised Ulbricht and sites like the SilkRoad. Why? Because i see the reality of the daily dangers of people selling drugs on the street. The consumption of the drug is not dangerous. The dealers are at risk (not from the law) because people know they have large amounts of drugs and money on them. Dealers get killed, jumped, robbed daily because they are exposed. The SilkRoad was the future of peaceful interaction in the black market.
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:14:25
you are stealing their hours worked to purchase the items you are robbing and the home you are burning down.
if i offer to sell you drugs, we enter into a non-violent contract that i will give you this substance for that amount of dollars. that is peaceful capitalism right there. Anarchy is peace. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:28:31
Let's start writing the script. 
My order from SilkRoad2 should be in this afternoon, come on over, we will get high and write the script that will get us out of serfdom

DPR was never charged with these accounts of murder-for-hire. It was most likely a smear campaign so the public would have a negative connotation of a peaceful man. seems like it worked on you.

Law of the land in a free country should not include laws regarding what you do in your own free time with your own body, so long as you are not hurting anyone else. fuck laws to protect our ideal society.
