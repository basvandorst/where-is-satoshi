Thanks a ton! I'm probably going to start mining this weekend, really excited to see some results

I edited this onto a post i put in r/bitcoinmining, but it never got answered. I have an amd fx 8350 GPU, but i can't seem to find the hash rate of it anywhere online. I'd like to know how much bitcoin i can mine before i start. If anyone knows its hash rate, i'd greatly appreciate it.

What subreddits are good for investment advice?

i'd love to buy a bitcoin now, but as a teen I've spent my money on other stuff. guess I need to hurry up and mow some lawns before one bitcoin gets too expensive. I heard about bitcoins probably almost a year ago on the tor network, wish I would have got some then.

I know i'm late, but I would greatly appreciate it if you could help me out some. i'm 100% behind bitcoin. i'm all for it, ready to put some money in for the long haul. my dad on the other hand, not quite. he likes the idea of it, but is completely turned off of bitcoin by the legality of it. I tried to show him some stuff on it, like the legality section of the wikipedia bitcoin page. he can't be convinced. so, is there any information you can show me (to show him) that can prove that at its current state, trading bitcoin in the US is legal, and the same for mining. also, he's worried that the government could try to make bitcoin illegal to trade or mine in the future, so anything disproving that would be great. really any info is appreciated. thanks a ton!

another question for everybody. i'm introducing bitcoin to my dad. he works with computers, so he's pretty tech savvy. he likes the idea of mining, but he's worried about the risks it can bring to your computer. 
so my question is, how risky is it to mine? as in viruses and getting your computer hacked and that sort of thing. not as in your hardware burning out
