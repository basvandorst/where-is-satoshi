2 weeks, I think. If you sent it for zero/little fee it still might not get through.

You’re not helping your case by being on a brand new account.

“Hodl” is more about not cashing out for your local currency than not spending it, I feel.

Electrum was definitely 2.X by then, it had updated to 2.0 in August 2014. You would have been on 2.4.1. Also, I can’t tell if [this commit]( would be relevant or if it was added before you downloaded, but it’s on August 4th 2015.

Whoops, it definitely is one more 0 than I thought it was.
