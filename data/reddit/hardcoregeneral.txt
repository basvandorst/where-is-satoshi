Funny how these companies remove crypto payments when the price is on the slide, then reinstate them when the price is back on the up!? Ha ha ha.

Also need one that lists worldwide, not just U.S. I am in the U.K. And we need more listings!

Who gives a shit, these child rapists are Pakistani gangs that are not native to our country!? They must be deported/executed, either will do. This wave of evil sweeping through Europe must be stopped and Tommy is one of a few who have the balls to stand up for whats right. Rock on Tommy, I’ll send you a few quid.

Much appreciated, thanks.

Thanks, this was exactly my thinking too. Having an olde world pub tucked away in the country, most people haven't even heard of Bitcoin, or think it's a joke or scam, like a couple of my customers yesterday. I'm hoping that putting this place on the Bitcoin map should indeed bring more custom our way, perhaps even from people who just want to support this payment method in its early days. I think it would be quite a novelty!

Hope to see you, make sure you ask for Andrew if paying with BTC, the mother in law wouldn't have a clue where to begin, ha ha!!

I'll look into those, thank you!

I've added us onto both Yelp! and Airbitz. Thanks for the tip!

Hi there, yes we are in Matlock itself, on the hillside. A lot of people just think of Matlock Bath with the cable cars and bikers, but we have a little pub called 'The Sycamore' here in Matlock 'proper'!

Know where I can download this printout? I want to stick it up in the pub toilets!
