I'm thinking about storing my coins on Gdax since I have multiple times of coins, but I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. Any thoughts?

i agree my friend. Buy, HODL, repeat are the answers for success. That is of course, if it doesnt descide to drop like crazy.

I noticed like 2 seconds after commenting that it said shitpost, but I was too lazy to delete.

is there a preferable way to store the coins so that it is very easy to get the forked coins and sell / potentially keep them. I ask because I am trying to find a way so that my parents have the easiest time in understanding the best options for them.

The blockchain.info one is very good.

this is old
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:45:13
But how can I transfer them without the fees, even if it says there will be when I go to do it onto my friend's account?

Electrum is very safe, however I highly, highly recommend getting a ledger nano s. Probably the best option for storage with a very good interface.

How am I cheating? Also, how can a minor get an ID meant for adults?
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:21:17
It says that any wallet that has an address that starts with 3 is compatible, yet I use Electrum which I heard is compatible and none of the addresses start with 3, where should I be looking to check because I feel as if I may be looking in the wrong place. Thank you

Why not just buy straight from GDAX? Why go through coinbase to then to to GDAX when you could just start there in the first place? Just wondering what the best options are.

I don't have an ID. I'm a minor

What exactly does 


And thank you for the reply.
@_date: 2018-08-04 22:15:20
Thank you for your comprehensive and understandable description. I greatly appreciate it
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:32:33
Oh ok that makes sense. Is it currently working as of now or is it all just test funds
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:39:00
Oh ok thank you. I downloaded the app from the website and it is probably just a testnet.
What exactly is the return for hosting a node with what is deposited? I assume it depends on how much is deposited, but i was wondering if you knew how exactly it worked. 
Thanks again

I figured that much, but I was wondering about CRYPTO  -&gt; CRYPTO.
Thanks for the response though, I appreciate it.

Hey, remember me? Well looks like it may happen after all. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:04:56
So if I have a ledger nano s and have my coins on legacy, how can I transfer them to segwit
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:52:36
What if you go onto an exchange like shapeshift and transfer your Bitcoin into another crypto like Reddcoin (as I have) or something of the such. Is that taxed?
