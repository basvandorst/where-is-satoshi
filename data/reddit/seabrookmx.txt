I only mined for a short time, but the quality of BTC Guild's site/pool was top notch. As a Software dev, I can really appreciate when somebody puts in the work to make an awesome product. It isn't easy.
Thanks for all the hard work, and for your contributions to the community!

Anyone know if the Canadian site  accepts BTC as well?
This would be a dream come true.
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:34:10
Huh.. I didn't know they did that. What's the point of the US site then :P?
@_date: 2014-07-21 04:16:34
They did?! Sick. 
Last I checked they hadn't. 
I blew 0.1BTC on gift cards from Gyft only to realize 75% of them were US only :(

Exactly. And this subreddit encourages is for some reason.
I remember the bubble before last, one of the most popular threads was titled "HOLD!" and the entire discussion was on how you should hold your coins to weather the price drop. 
Up above, we have the OP justifying his lack of BTC paranoia by saying he's [in it for the long term]( 
As a commodity, I don't see how Bitcoin is useful. I want there to be more services like Gyft (or for Gyft to support more vendors, and ones in countries other than the US) for me to use with my Bitcoins. I'm not in to spending hours of every day staring at exchange rates. I certainly don't do that with the CAD/USD exchange rate.

Was this before you started studying Comp. Sci? You seem to be pretty knowledgeable... did you get into computers and programming early?
I'm a fairly recent CS grad but I can't even fathom being a notable player/developer in the bitcoin world at my age. 
Thanks for your contributions and the AMA btw.

Well obviously. 
You left out the part where the C beams have to be perfectly aligned with the molecular crystal core, which has to be cooled by a panametric fan due to extremely high energy density.

Not with good case ventilation.

Difficulty is skyrocketing. I just got my BFL 5GH/s (actually averages about 7) but I'm only expecting a return if the price of BTC stays really high. I find it a hobby interest though, so I'm not too concerned.
BFL has shit customer service, and you wouldn't see your rig until the summer most likely. Not at all worth it. I was actually pretty surprised I even got mine, considering I ordered it in March.

Yeah it sounds really loud.

Lestamore is right. You (and me too) have missed the boat as far as mining goes. 
If you want to get into it, buying bitcoins is probably the way to do it. That said, prices are so volatile, its hard to say when a good time to buy is. BTC/USD could drop to it's former ~$130 very shortly, or it could continue its climb. We can only guess which way it will go. 
However, if you do want to buy Bitcoins, do so from a [reputable service]( If you're new to Bitcoin, it could be easy for somebody to scam you when doing a one-on-one deal through craigslist etc.

Your link didn't work for me. I had to take out an errant "http" in the middle of the addy.
Also, as your article states, this isn't the only way to separate nitrogen from air, it's simply the method they use when creating liquid nitrogen because the process requires the nitrogen gas be extremely pure. You only need extremely low temperatures to generate *liquid* nitrogen, not to *collect nitrogen gas from the environment*.
Common method:
Machine using this method:
My uncle owns a tire shop. He uses one of these guys, which separates the nitrogen and fills it's tank with 98-99% nitrogen gas, which you then use to fill performance tires (as nitrogen doesn't expand as much when heated as normal air, and also leaks out slower). 
That said, I still think the miner is a scam. I just think you're a little off base with the nitrogen argument.

I've never seen a Lorax quote used so well. I love Seuss. 
An orange upward pointing arrow for you sir/madam.

How is this any different from buying games on Steam for example? You get nothing physical.
