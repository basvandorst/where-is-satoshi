It will exist one day. For sure. My wife is absolutely against it. 
I will still do it :) 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:34:19
Yes time is different! It is not a bubble! 
Really! I swear! 
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:09:26
Need to sell it on kraken for example. They have a dark market (which doesn't move the public price) because those are a ton of btc. Probably won't get full price though :) 
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:21:03
You don't make big money with it. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:26:26
It is definitely a bubble though. The big question is : how big is it? 200, 400 or 600?
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:03:36
She definitely is :) 
That's why I married her.

Under 40 here, same problem there. I dont care either :) 
I will live in a well suited nice home in a gated community nice and save. They can go suck balls. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:19:25
That's not inside. It is the price (in the old days) 
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:38:28
No one selling. So not much traffic :) 
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:21:59
My wife accepts bitcoin as the new global money. 
She does not care how much it worth though.

What happens if amd and nvidia start to mine?
Create card, move it 100m.
Start to mine.
Profit. Tons of.

I want to time lock my coins for 30 years.
But so, it is still a ton of work :(
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:46:13
I think trump talked already about it. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:01:54
Good, I want cheap coins.

@_date: 2017-05-27 14:36:30
But but Bitcoin was supposed to stop that!
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:43:30
Both. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 11:52:07
Do you mean sex?
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:28:28
It never was. No idea why people thought that. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:21:19
Seems like a ddos is starting, time to sell :)
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:54:31
Return to "normal" 
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:23:39
We are at "return to normal".
Waiting for the real drop. So I can buy :)
Doubled already my sweet sweet coins.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:32:28
Right now whales are trying to get other whales to buy. Which works. 
For now. 
Let's see what happens when one of them stops. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:06:05
No, release those coins to the kids, so they can hodl :)
My plan at least :)
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:26:38
He is joking. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:30:40
Can confirm, friend of mine works in tax office from the government. 
They also have tanks, space ships and satellites to track you! 
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:23:19
Fuck yeah! 
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:25:42
I think it will end more like windows and Linux. 
Firms will mostly use bitcoins. Because they are free / cheap. While public people will will use national blockchain from the state.

@_date: 2017-06-09 15:26:18
W00t? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:39:41
Why the fuck shouldn't I sell high and buy back later for cheaper?
