Thanks! Love the idea of lightning - big fan.  Can you suggest a source for two questions:
1. What is the vision of how the "hubs" will evolve.  Critics keep saying will be banks all over, but I can see many smaller hubs.  Any good speculation on how this may evolve?
2. Heard that tx time for sender is different than recipient.  naysayers have pointed this out, but can we assume these instant confirmations are two way and symmetrical?
Would be great to have someone destroy the hit pieces I've seen (won't post here.)
Awesome list !

He is trying to take over the Bitcoin brand. Reprehensible low .  Like calling yourself redit so people make the mistake.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:36:00
Thanks - my point is that the Hubs will provide channels for users and need to hold them open with BTC.  Therefore if many hubs have channels (I see this like a reserve currency) then that BTC will be locked up and effectively reducing the available supply.  I realize that this "could" be temporary, but as I asked earlier for a vision of hubs, I could see some marketplace leaders with large channels open.  Once could argue that this is just sitting in a wallet anyway but there is real impact.  In fact, this mirrors the Bank Reserve Requirements  which affects the money supply.

Really - so LN is only for &lt;50% of assets, then i have a whole different way to transact.  what if i have assets in other crypto or fiat.  I like the analogy and can definitely work for small payments, but pls don't try to globally apply this use case. 
Having to tie up one's assets is a common thing.  in stocks, CDs bonds, or running a business.  The problem is that it all has to be in bitcoin and people will not (for a while) keep everything in bitcoin and want to go on chain when they transact under certain conditions and not others.  
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:31:37
And what if you want to write a check that is larger than what you have in your savings account. Sure I understand this concept but often we want to send more than 50% of our account value and effectively that would not be possible here

Do not understand your comment.  payment channel required committed funds.  open/close is on-chain fee.

I heard a report that a recipient did not receive the confirmation at the same time as the sender.  Can't recall where, but will look into it.

What is missing: mining is driving renewable innovation and paying for otherwise unused overcapacity which funds more renewables.  There are miners using excess natural gas as carbon capture as they can put machines anywhere - even in gas fields.  This is driving innovation not creating CO2!

Backwards - Bulls getting rekt.  Some whale(s) saw all the stop-losses in the order book (yet again) and drove the price down, then scooped up the cheap btc.  This is a cycle that will continue until we have institutional buyers on weekends with iceberg orders to block these manipulators.  probably retail and leveraged rekt.  Dilemma is that institutions less likely to take btc seriously until volatility and blatant manipulation is addressed.

Question - since a large amount of BTC will be needed to open and maintain a chanell, do we expect this will "lock up" BTC and reduce the liquidity.  This is happening with Dash Masternodes.  You need 1000 Dash and effectively reduce avail supply to trade.  Ultimately, this would drive up the price of BTC if large / many hubs form.

This is not bitmex, these are pro traders.  Problem is bitmex has 10x volume of other exchanges. This short / long squeeze has real effect on volatility until more liquidity in regulated markets like bakkt. Unfortunately this is the only way to stop this and the worst impact are the rekt retail guys that loose thier house and blame it on Bitcoin so roubini and others can call cryptocurrency the enemy. I don't want regs, but until the market grows and matures this will keep happening.

Tragically, this being one of the best wallets for Android, the company seems to have very little business sense. It could have validated the code through third parties or used many other approaches, but they have basically no registered company, and have been tweeting like 7 year olds. It is really unfortunate, they have solved many problems with multiple token support. I hope that they figure out a way to build confidence, and stop deceiving people by saying they are open source, because they could easily code the software to steal everyone's keys instantly. The truth is I use it occasionally but I feel extremely vulnerable. Hopefully the community will pressure them to grow up and either make the code open or provide some other assurance that they are not thieves.

@_date: 2017-12-26 06:41:04
Keep in mind there was a lot of theory.  Tx fees where forseen when mining was no longer profitable, 10 min was arbitrary, it was all an experiment.  We have a problem now with high fees and many solutions which will solve eventually (yes we are all impatient)  Alt coins are good - they drive innovation.  It's all open source which builds off other projects.  The goal is to redefine commerce, that takes some pain and learning - and a lot of collaboration not FUD.

Agree that layer 2 is a needed solution, however other crypto is doing a lot on chain and some proposals - like MAST and others need to be advocated too.If the community agrees that layer 2 is the only answer - then an Altcoin like Dash, Litecoin, Ripple, etc. will take a massive mindshare/marketshare from Bitcoin. The "answer" cannot simply be layer 2.  Perhaps a true collaboration with litecoin and atomic swaps adopted universally to take the pressure off is a pragmatic approach.

I understand where you are coming from, but see comment above.  If bitcoin brand takes too much of a hit, enough people are scammed it could be like Mt Gox and take a long time to build confidence.

Miner self interest almost to the point of killing bitcoin - just to avoid innovation that would reduce their fees.  Totally understandable.  Short term view. IMO a large drop in BTC value is that miners are selling quick as the profitability falls. Long view - adoption and speed, low tx fees, etc. will drive up price due to scarcity.

You can take a look for yourself and see the relationship between the value of the dollar and Bitcoin. There are also historical parallels of gold and the dollar crashing. Typically at first Commodities or assets may increase, but if it is a global collapse, and if the US dollar collapses it definitely will be a global collapse, then assets also will fall as people need to pay for things, they need to sell their Bitcoin. In the end it would just be plain old bad. This is especially true for the US dollar which is the reserve currency of the world.

Anyone old enough to remember the Wall Street boiler rooms in the 70s and 80s while there was lacks regulation should appreciate the step up now in crypto exchanges, it's very easy for people to get cheated and manipulated.  One can argue that it will lead to regulation but at the end of the day scammers and charlatans should be caught and punished.  It does not necessarily mean more regulation just willingness to prosecute. Also for those who say that this is just a US issue, the us can go after any entity that has a banking relationship or customers in the US so the scope is global

Hopefully you have read the dissenting commissioner on the recent ETF ruling. 
 The SEC has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin only the ETF.  They have nothing to do with gold oil or even volatility based ETFs,. Only the regulated ETF itself.  The overreach is completely transparent and at some point will have to give way to the will of its constituents who are mostly the large investment Banks.  I believe that this is a purposeful delay, trying to lower the price of Bitcoin, Endtime the regulation so the large investors can buy the cheapest price possible. This is exactly what happened with the gold ETF

See Charlie Lee's Twitter post, he sums it up nicely, Bitcoin and Litecoin are the hash leaders in their algorithm space so they are the least vulnerable 2 a 51% attack, they also have the highest the value, so the incentive to attack and destroy the value is for the reduced. Also keep in mind that if a miner attacks with just a financial incentive, all that expensive equipment will soon be come worthless too.  There could be terrorist or other incentives but the financial incentive is set up extremely well for Bitcoin Litecoin and ethereum.  Others who are not leading in there hashing algorithm are much more vulnerable.

Is the US republican controlled congress rational?  Last week they played chicken and completely destroyed hopes of their achieving their centerpiece platform of healthcare.  why?  because one group said they wouldn't vote on cutting healthcare because the bill didn't cut enough - in the end THEY ALL LOST.  It was about power, principal, control, etc. and they undermined their own self-interest.  The BU miners may prefer to destroy BTC rather than lose control - or at least try to play chicken.

To contrast that we need to attack him without emotion but with facts.  Several times he quoted bitcoin's scaling limitation, however there are efforts to address that.  He said 90% of icos are scams and bankrupt.  not true and the data suggests that they have failed to deliver on their promise.  In 2013 he tweeted that Bitcoin crashed as it dropped 43% to $54   this man needs to be put in his place in amateur and unemotional refutation sent to the Senate Banking Committee members.

I love it.  **However**  the petty responses here show either a lack of  marketing understanding or an attempt to obfuscate this criticism .  PLEASE DO NOT MESS THIS UP - you will lose your reputation entirely and for no good reason.
Anyone using a crypto wallet is making themselves vulnerable to attack.  they must trust the party.   Coinbase, for all its horrible blemishes, is licensed, insured by Lloyds of London and the FDIC for theft. They are also audited.
Open Source implies a  community auditing.  I get that you don't want your IP stolen and abused - but you can't have it both ways.
Are you actually claiming that you do not advertise as open source and that it is a google caching issue?  It is everywhere.  On your website, android marketplace, blog posts, etc. and you continued to make that reference **AFTER** you covertly made it closed source.
How can you expect people are not suspicious. 
I don't need to see the source - I need assurances that you are taking strong security measures and have some 3rd party audit process.
Conomi  could be the biggest crypto scam since Mt Gox (and so could other wallets.)  You will be far more successful if you can help alleviate valid concerns and not try to sweep this under the rug.

I completely agree. When people look at market cap or volume and not considering that there is about 800 million dollars at last count that is removed from the value of Bitcoin each month do to transaction fees and block rewards and needs to be replaced by new buyers.  Those new tires also need to replace any selling that occurs. This is not a big deal in a bull market but in a bear Market I think it is.  I also think that the whales and institutions who can't wait to buy Bitcoin or sitting it out until we see some signs of a bottom and a systemic health problem in the system.  It sucks and I can't wait for the cycle to end but that's my read.  Perhaps for clothes.

Some do not sell immediately.  Some will hedge with short positions.  The ones that hold and wait for a good price are speculating in the same way that you take out margin on an exchange.  This is really dangerous.  If miners are near or below breakeven, accumulate en-mass, waiting for the price to rise and it stays in a bear market, we will see a leveraged bubble burst and big drops.  we may be seeing that now with dumping.  miners need to pay their bills or have electric shut off.

1. His points are valid, his evidence is either deceptive or ignorant confusing causation with correlation (at best)
2. I didn't see the context of the core dev quotes.  His point that bitcoin should have low tx costs and core devs don't seem to be concerned need a source.  perhaps a definitive statement.  I do see his point that blockstream is interested in creating a channel rather than p2p but the two are not mutually exclusive.
3. He is passionate but appears so hostile - The way he degrades core as not understanding economics and yet is making so many logical errors is scary.

If minors have already sunk costs into equipment then in the near term that does not influence their decision,. These are pretty basic micro economic Concepts that when the incremental variable cost to operate exceeds the revenue, marginal profitability is negative and there is no incentive to produce. Certainly there can be other factors like the expectation that prices will rise in the future but still that kind of speculation is essentially buying on margin because when the electric bill comes they'll have to dip into credit.

Ok - glad you can hear it.


Not personally, just want to make sure when you are making a point that is based on logic that you back it up.  Totally fine to state opinions - but you the way you are writing (e.g. "What drove up the price in 2017? FOMO ... ", "I'm just speaking the truth.

Most hardware is specialized to SHA256.  If you have a more profitable SHA256 coin they will usually switch, unless they are propping up a coin like BCash.  Note that no other SHA256 has much value as they are vunerable to a 51% attack as seen with a few coins recently (e.g. Litecoin Cash)

I would expect to see hashrate stop increasing and stay flat, We're miners do exit but they're offset by increased efficiency and lower cost minors. At some point when hashrate does start to drop and we see panic because my nerves are getting into debt, those signs will be very clear and lead to a systemic health problem in the ecosystem. As it stands right now. At that point the big investors are going to come in because they will see a bottom.  I can't imagine anybody has actually calculated that point, and even those large investors will want to get in before each other so it may not actually reach that bottom, but the big money is waiting to get as close as possible and they have been waiting since November.  Also I think it's indisputable that everything is pegged to bitcoin so all of the other altcoins will have a far greater effect.  I can't wait for this cycle to be over, but I think in the end it will be healthy and let's just be real about this and not try to sugar coat this stuff. Because there many people with lots of money at stake and sugar coating is really scaring them.

FYI - let's not forget miner tx fees - those play into miner profitability too and are as great or greater than the reward at times.  So, some miners are at break-even with fees and rewards near $7K (others much much lower ~ $3K) and if they are holding, waiting for price to go up so they can pay their utilities, and in a bear market that backlog of selling pressure can hit hard, especially with the low volume we are seeing.  I think that is where we could see the "health of the network begins to show signs of weakness" - when miners get crushed speculating on price, and decide to remove hashrate.  This will probably look like a step curve as miner's hold-out, waiting for last chance to exit before they have to pay.  
Note - with exponential efficiency in hash rate, it is unlikely hash will drop - will probably be flat.  a month of that should be a clear worrisome indicator.  
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:30:47
True but it may just be flat because keep in mind that people are operating at different cost levels and efficiency can also come in to play so if we see a flat line in hashrate it means that a lot of people have exited.

Hi thanks yes I'm aware of how this works. My point being that the futures, perpetual's and more like spots they're not really features, are usually above the Perpetual or spot price.  My point being that if miners were really hedging insignificant volume it would mean that the Futures are generally short and Below spot. Of cours
e there could be lots of market dynamics but from my observations, and that generally the Futures are above spot, there does not tend to be much hedging using bitmex. Similarly the cash futures don't have much volume on the traditional commodity exchanges. I do understand your point and I'm not disputing it, I would just expect much more sell volume if miners were really hedging much.

The idea that institutions are a single entity is completely misguided. There are many parties who are waiting on the sidelines, however they are all going to compete with one another. This is Game Theory first-mover advantage. It drove the price up in the past and will repeat as soon as fomo kicks in.  Just like any asset class this is cyclical,. Bitcoin has demonstrated a velocity based on limited liquidity which will Define the bottom at the point where volume and demand accelerates.  As soon as one major investor decides the price has hit that point we will go into a bull cycle.

I think you are absolutely correct, don't know about your estimates of where this will occur but there will be a natural floor where a substantial number of minors will exit.  Personally I think there is a massive amount of institutional and high net worth corporate and other money waiting on the sidelines until they find this point because they want to buy how to near the bottom.  Then we'll start to see a significant rise because everything will follow the smart money. Those bold enough to try and time it may win or lose, I've generally gotten screwed trying to time these things.

What you are describing when minors wait for the price to increase before selling is essentially hedging, because it's some point they have to pay the electric bill with Fiat. So if they weight successfully in a bull market that's fine, but in a bear Market they'll keep waiting and waiting until they have to sell and that is a massive dump of downward pressure, essentially creating a long squeeze. I think we've been seeing a lot of this lately and at some point minors are simply going to exit. This would show a dip in hash power or a flat line in has power assuming that people exiting will be offset by improved efficiency. At the end of the day this will be a painful but healthy cycle, and I can't wait for it to be over.  It boils down to a massive game of chicken where the weekends will fold and the rest of us will hold

Very Strange To me: "SegWit is not running in production because the conditions made clear in the Hong Kong agreement have not been met, in which we foresee a non-witness block size increase coming together with SegWit. "
So on Feb 21st they all supported Segwit.  Then they changed their minds as it was not going to happen - however if all the miners signaled today, rather than BTU, they would be close to 70%.  I wonder why they supported it and quickly changed their minds?

I think you nailed exactly the right analogy with the US dollar and other countries. In fact there is a dilute of effect when other countries print money, but only to the extent that they have value relative to the US dollar and it's trading partners. But the u.s. dollar versus other currencies has value because people say it does. And the reason for that has a lot to do with a network affect which is similar toWhat is mentioned about Facebook and other examples.  Facebook Twitter and other social networks are valuable because of the participants; and number, quality, frequency of communication and many other attributes. For example LinkedIn has a different value than Facebook, and it may not have to do with the number of people or the number of messages but the value of the network nodes or individuals.  So in summary it is quite possible that another altcoin or different kind of crypto becomes more valuable than Bitcoin in the future, and the ruble becomes more valuable than the US dollar.  In my opinion that has nothing to do with scarcity however; I think Bitcoin has a much stronger scarcity value than any fiat currency.  But if the vision of Andre Antonopoulos starts to materialize, and there are many of these Network cryptocurrencies serving different purposes, they may all have a dilution affect overall. That has nothing to do with scarcity, and in fact the value could increase because the ecosystem also grows so the discussion is very interesting but the scarcity argument is false.

Here are a couple of thoughts. First, when you asked a question of driving it, it's really the wrong question. This is a decentralized network phenomenon so by definition it is driven by no-one or everyone depending on how you want to look at it. I think part of the revolution is eliminating the middleman. If you look at how email disintermediated the Postal Service, and the internet intermediated shops and media conglomerates , there is a potential disruption in many different areas where institutions have disproportionate control and drive advantages to the wealthy or those at the top. In particular, the unbanked have a tremendous opportunity. So many people are taken advantage of, and Bitcoin can enable a new source of freedom. Finally, when we here about the break-in of personal information over and over again, and institutions legally or illegally using our spending patterns to Target us without our consent, and let's face it that information is used to determine how much we pay on car insurance, life insurance the jobs we get and I could go on and on. By disintermediatating , we can disrupt and create hopefully a much more modern efficient private and citizen Centric concept of money and wealth.  You can still be a capitalist and a crypto fan, just like you can love media and the internet but things have changed a lot since the days of going to the blickbuster video store.  Besides all that once you start to play with this it's just fun!

Delicious Proof of Roger Ver Employing Sockpuppets!
3 Bitcoin - The Currency of the Internet / by / 28min ago
Roger has said on several occasions, very loudly and sometimes while waving his middle finger at the camera, that he absolutely does not employ sockpuppet accounts of any kind.
Besides his failed 'feed the birds' project that let anyone on his website pay others to be twitter sockpuppets, it's been hard to pin him down to actually employing them, until now.
After writing a particularly Bcash-slanted article about Slush's AsicBoost news over the weekend, Bitcoin.com writer Jamie Redmond got called out by Bitcoin Magazine's writer Aaron van Wirdum on Twitter:
After Aaron called Jamie's source "misinformed noise," Jamie took it as an insult and exited the argument quickly, only to pick up the conversation as a sockpuppet called 'Jonathan Herringbone.'
During that parlance, Jamie then forgot to switch his account back to Herringbone's for one response, and answered as himself, talking about himself in the third person to continue the argument:
To make matters worse, Jamie then deleted his post, but not before the Internet Archive took a snapshot of it:
Jamie then Blocked Aaron, and followed up on the thread by claiming that he is under attack, and that Aaron is fabricating evidence against him:
This is Roger's Senior writer at his newsdesk, clearly an employee. If Roger wants to keep claiming he never employs sockpuppets, he'd now have to fire Jamie.

This is WHY we see these pumps and dumps.  Someone can drive the book and count on this liquidation , then start selling it off slowly at the top.  rinse and repeat.  bitmex themselves could do it - not saying it is the case here, but why else do you think we see these big spikes - to crush the shorts (or longs) who are leveraged or trigger stop losses.  The way to avoid is increase liquidity - you would need a deep pocket to do this to gold, currencies, aapl, etc.

They can.  just keep a copy of the segwit for yourself and it is immutable - hashed to the transaction.  If the nodes go down before the tx there was not tx.  After and you can save the blockchain to validate if you need to.  This is just pure nonsense and fake news.

Point is that you can keep if you want so article is totally mute.  Also, the protocol demands that the signature is valid so ipsofacto you implicitly have the sig.

Exactly.  There is no reason to make dramatic assumptions about how people will act.  A different way to look at is that the miners are taking the high ground and following through with a plan that has a substantial level of support.  You may not like it, but it is FINALLY a path forward.  Could Core agree to a 2MB block size in 6 months?  8 months and get everyone on the same chain?  Perhaps?  The level of hate and emotion here is really dumbfounding.  It is greater than US politics.  Rather than chose to be an ideology and assume the worst of minors perhaps a more constructive solution that gives some level of control to both communities can help bitcoin thrive and be decentralized.  The rhetoric in response to this very well written post is really sad and ultimately will threaten the survival of bitcoin.  Can some of you bright people propose solutions like [ James Hilliard] ( who helped avoid a major segwit clash.

It might be good if Core were more current about their attitude to this in light of segwit2x and miners collaboration.

They have proposed several approaches to larger blocks.  They just don't trust that it will follow segwit - no?  This solves the problem and furthermore they agreed to segwit2x but that alienates the Core developers.  MADASS could potentially resolve that issue.  Why would Core object to this? 
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:43:03
One step at a time.  Perhaps Core can help with 2MB sane approach with better testing and longer horizon - since miners are willing to allow SF segwit that is compatible with BIP 148.  They will likely run Core nodes anyway at first as the segwit 2x code is crappy.   This is a real chance for some collaboration.  Hope we don't blow it.
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:59:46
Really?  My understanding is that every calculation showing growth in dicates the need for larger blocks - eventually.  The main issues are:
when?, SF vs. HF, impact to people running nodes.
In a compromise, nobody gets everything they want, however a gesture by some Core members could lead to a compromise that will build confidence in bitcoin.

I know it is unlikely, but agreement by a few Core developers to safely collaborate toward larger blocks (say over 12 months, or other compromise that gets us to a better tech solution and includes Core team) would probably double bitcoin value in weeks.  Miners could run Core and avoid risky btc1 branch.  
Pure fantasy? Can pragmatism prevail?  Please offer constructive thoughts not rants if possible.

Good point.  What I mean are Core developers indicating their support.  We do not need all Core committers, but there is clearly leadership.  Adding 2MB is not a special interest.

There is so much anger / hate  against groups - it's almost like racism or anti-antisemitism and no trust.  The principal that Core was not involved and the code can be faulty is the main issue.  I see it as a chance for greater trust and collaboration if the miners comply.  The threat of USAF is also very powerful and can be used as leverage but hopeful in a way that will not antagonize.  keep in mind that many do agree with segwit2x - as a pragmatic path forward, not as an ideal solution.

Sorry guys, still not getting it... I'm a miner on core today.  I signal bit 1 AND bit 4.  I don't need to change anything until the 2x hard fork.  In fact many miners are signaling both ... Sort of since segwit2x does not yet exist.  So it seems like this will be a big win for segwit/scale fans who want to to stay on core.  Kicks the can down the road but who knows perhaps core will join the party since they now have sidechains.
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:12:46
    The opinions of "Core," whatever that is, are irrelevant.
But they are running most of the nodes.  I don't think they are.  If there is a solution that can avoid conflict (and lower the price) why not go for it.  Core developers have added tremendous value to bitcoin - even if there is philosophical disagreement, we can all agree that we want it to succeed and not lose out to a shitcoin or ETH - and that is clearly happening.  There is already a ticking time bomb in the future of bitcoin if nothing is done.  This approach lowers the risks.

Segwit2MB=SegWit2x=[Bitcoin Scaling Agreement at Consensus 2017]( or are you making a distinction there.  Agreement is for 2MB.  This is very similar to COOP since BIP91 will support all segwit implementation via SF.  Until now, it was either custom Segwit support or HF - now we have greater compatibility and a chance for Core to influence the increase to 2MB in a safe way.

Ok - perfect, but let's say segwit already gives a 50% boost (I find the argument that it is 2MB already is weak and lot's of games) what if Core added 128k and combine that with a layer 2 with some criteria for growing further.... I don't know the answer but point is that if some smart people like you came up with a solution that could keep miners on Core chain rather than segwit2x and signal BIP 141 to lock in (like litecoin did) then we could get past some of the debate, give the miners a small win and watch the value of BTC grow!
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:25:06
IMO there is general confusion about inherent value and intrinsic value.  the latter has a very specific meaning in finance as The source defines above.  Having inherent value means that it is the essence of the thing.  Currency has inherent financsl value because that's its sole purpose.  gold has inherent value because that is its primary characteristic in addition to other uses.  
Anyone who talks about the intrinsic value of money is making an error in its use, but everybody knows what they're trying to say.
People think that Bitcoin are simply bits like an email or a document. Now if that document contains an earnings report the day before it's filed it certainly has high-value.
The fallacy is that Bitcoin to people who understand it has inherent value and people who don't, well I'll figure it out later probably too late.
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:42:19
I believe that for the SF BIP91 part of segwit2x most miners will stay on core as it is stable and signal on BOTH bit 1 and bit 4 (via patch?).  Can't imagine they would risk running new code fork with little testing.  Fun begins when segwit locks and we have the new HF 2MB debate for 3 months....  I think the world will change (for the better) by then.  Especially if they do stay with Core and some compromise is made or someone spends their BTC to buy massive hashing power :)
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:04:45

@_date: 2017-06-22 23:08:20
I **Agree** but "politically motivated" is different than collaborative compromise.  Anyone who owns bitcoin will benefit from that and adoption will increase / competition will falter.  
But while I agree with what you are saying, calling it a war is making it a war.  




are examples of why they don't want to be seen as "losing" .  Nobody has to lose!  If miners are recognized as important, having agreed to segwit, and all Core devs do is agree to come up with something better than 2x - which may give them a bit more control but done in a much safer way.
So the point being - if they were to make that statement now, and we can get all miners to run BIP 141 with 95% hash rate (we already have 90%) then **everybody can win**
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:12:21
exactly.  its their move.
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:32:45
The battle for segwit is over.  The War is over when there is a meaningful truce which takes building trust over time.  Miners will try and fight back - just look at what Bitmain threatened to do ... insane but you can't dismiss someone with that kind of hashrate and influence.  Also 90% means they have to run segwit2x nodes not core nodes - the whole point is let's get them to 95% on Core runing BIP 141!
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:07:09
Does not rely on premise they are willing to render equipment worthless.  It is an agreement, like ETH that the problem must be solved.  No hard fork.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:13:02
So (my understanding) for miners who want to run core now - before segwit2x HF, they can signal both bit 1 and bit 4 as the safest move.  I suspect there will be many miners who do not want to risk moving off Core immediately and since segwit will be compatible they should be in good shape....for a few months anyway :)
