I think this actually has a lot to do with it. Two weeks ago, before the futures opened, you could get a transaction done in 10 minutes at about 300 sat/B. I've got 3 transactions stuck now because the price has jumped to over 1000 sat/B. I'm only moving small amounts around to exchanges to make purchases, so I'm not interested in paying those prices. Since this all happened shortly after the futures went online, my theory is that large institutional investors (as well as complete Noobs with more $ than sense) have jumped in with both feet, driven the price up, and as the market is correcting (as is completely natural) they are desperately trying to get out ahead of the curve to save some capital from what they are afraid is a complete loss. Basically, people and banks are treating this like a "Sure Thing" instead of what it really is, a very useful tool for moving currency around, based in a HIGHLY speculative market that is prone to WILD swings both up and down.

The Santa Claus Rally is a real thing. Just like Sell in May and Stay Away. All the institutional investors sell up in May, then go on vacation to the Hamptons for the summer so they don't have to work, then usually in November, after the Q3 earnings reports are out, they start buying back into those stocks that have growth potential in Q1 and Q2 in the new year, which leads to the build-up in price ahead of Xmas, thus leading to the "Santa Claus Rally" before everyone takes 2 weeks off for Christmas.
