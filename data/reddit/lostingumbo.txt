Master... thanks for the info... looking for some clarification here.  As I understand it, if you spend $100 worth of bitcoin to purchase something you would claim the difference between your cost basis and the value of bitcoin at the time of purchase.  For example.  I buy bitcoin at $1000 and bitcoin is $1000 when I use those bitcoin to buy something then no tax is due.  The cost basis is the same as the value when the bitcoin was spent.  In the same example, if I buy bitcoin at $1000 and bitcoin is $2000 when I spend $100 on something I will then need to claim $50 as regular income (the bitcoin I spent cost me $50 when I bought it but I realized $100 in purchasing value when I spent it).  
Anyway, that is how I am thinking about it.  Maybe for 2018 and beyond but I can see the logic for 2017.  What I don't understand is how to claim losses (especially if less than 30 days) and gifts... I've given away a good bit of bitcoin, so not a loss or a gain but what was the cost basis of those bitcoin wrt the bitcoins that remain that I may spend or convert... fun isn't it... :)

Great post!  Like many of you I don't talk about it at work and when it comes up I don't comment at all.  That said my family knows I'm big into BTC and have been giving the kids some along the way so we can participate in my "hobby" together.  But I always tell them to keep it to themselves and not make a big deal of it...

And I was thinking you were going to say that the bar took bitcoin!

Kuddo's to you for putting this together, very innovative!

Good for you buddy, glad your plan is working out.  I had a good friend that I used to invest with in the biotechs back in the day when they were having their "moment" and he said something after I sold my holdings of a company after a 100% profit after a week that I have never forgotten.  I was upset that the price continued to go up after I sold and he reminded me that "no one ever went broke taking a profit."  No one can predict the future for sure.  It is easy to get caught up in the moment and lose perspective.  Thanks for sharing.

Did you bid?  It is up to $62,900, or about 8.3 BTC.  Go for it!

Yes, normal.  You can ignore it though, up to you.

That is exactly what I was thinking!

Ahh, cute, I wasn't expecting that.  They put a lot of time and thought into putting this together! Cheers

People have asked what would Bitcoin do if the stock market crashed... now we know.  Or, do we know what the stock market does when Bitcoin crashes? Hmmm

It peaks... 5 min after I buy it, then it goes down, down, down.  After I give up and sell, it goes up, up, up.

Wow, I had no idea.  I figured a couple of dollars for the service but $25 is out of line with the purchase value.  Is this typical of the MyCellium type wallets?  It sure is easy to use but that is a hefty price for simplicity!  Who is getting the "fees?"
