Thank you.

Happy Birthday Bitcoin

Is anyone else confused as much as I am about this? If this recent change isn't coming into effect until 2018, wouldn't like-kind exchanges still be permissible to claim on 2017 taxes?
I don't understand why people are acting as if this also affects our 2017 taxes?

I wish I could be in the trenches coding and helping support Bitcoin's cause more directly, but I'm brand spanking new to coding and I imagine it's gonna be a while until I'm capable enough.
In the meantime, the only other way I can help support Bitcoin's cause is through art, and that's exactly what I plan on doing!! Whooo!! "That's all folks!"

Joe: Ohhh I see. So Roger Ver is kinda like the Carlos Mencia of Bitcoin, stealing other people's hard work and lying out of his asshole. Do you think we could get him to try mushrooms?
