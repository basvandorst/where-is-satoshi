You have some incorrect inormation in your video regarding your commentary on long and short term capital gains.
Unlike in the United States, Canada does not distinguish between short-term vs. long-term gains where you'd pay different rates on each type of gain

In your accounting section you discuss LIFO and FIFO. Neither of these are accepted by the CRA which requires ACB.
The first-in, first-out rule – which assumes that shares acquired first are also sold first – is one of several accounting methods accepted by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. However, the CRA requires that investors use the average cost of securities (including commissions) for calculating capital gains.
I suggest you edit this video and do some additional research. There are too many inaccuracies for a learning video.

The author has these two character mixed up:
Mathematician Dorian Nakamoto is probably the most promising target — however Dorian denies even knowing about Bitcoin before 2014. And is not afraid of suing those who claim otherwise.
Programmer Hal Finney was one of the first cryptocurrency adopters and Bitcoin developers — and his death in 2014 explains the disappearance of Satoshi.
Hal was the Mathematician and most likely, Dorian was the programmer and not likely.

I get this error message every time I have tried to make a transaction over the past 3 days. I have tried cold storage, trezor and SA account transactions.

Can you site a link discussing how the encrypted private key is not fully encrypted? I have just read the spec from davotoula's link and I do not see anything like this. I did not see any warning or mention.
This looks encrypted to me:
Do AES256Encrypt(bitcoinprivkey[0...15] xor derivedhalf1[0...15], derivedhalf2), call the 16-byte result encryptedhalf1
Do AES256Encrypt(bitcoinprivkey[16...31] xor derivedhalf1[16...31], derivedhalf2), call the 16-byte result encryptedhalf2

Forbes has figured it all out.
Anyone else noticed that Forbes has had a huge number of articles on bitcoin? The last sentence of the article tips their hand and gives it all away.
Want to know who Satoshi is? Someones at Forbes already knows. Read it now before someone noticed and the article is redacted.

read the Forbes article, then go back and (re)read the original posts where bitcoin was announced, then go to irc and ask if those guys are still involved in the bitcoin community and see how many private windows pop up...
You don't actually need Forbes, read every one of the original posts and it is obvious but it is not at all surprising that a financial journalist figured it out, this is their job. What is intriguing is that they are hinting at it.

Is vircurex and exchange? I went to check them out but their website seems to be down.

Just be thankful that all they are doing is taking your money..governments have a history of doing a lot worse.

so if I want to transfer to another phone or my phone becomes broken or lost how do I access my accounts if there is no way to backup?

Havelock has been a reliable platform for me so far.

This happened in the middle of the night EST. I happened to be on the midnight shift watching it. I wonder if when the East coast of the US wakes up there will be fireworks.

Don't be fooled, CNBC isn't ignorant they are protecting their interest. This is called propaganda. Learning to recognize it is a huge advantage.

awesome site, wish i could create an account and save it
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:32:16
Diggnation and twit were as close to pure propaganda as I have encountered in the tech world, be careful.

libertybit can already do this.
@_date: 2013-04-27 00:39:35
The problem with "investing" in bitcoin denominated equities is is the price of Bitcoin climbs high, quickly, the price of your investment will drop and you may actually lose bitcoins. You basically have to think that Bitcoins will grow less in value than the company which seems unlikely as it is a real company with real resource constraints.

Has anyone used this service yet? I am interested, it is a novel and innovative idea.

Satoshi is a brilliant metaphore, admitting it would destroy the myth and Bitcoin would lose. Only someone with nothing to lose could do something so heroic. He is Satoshi.

yes you have to setup an account to accept Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-22 14:34:44
You are underestimating Bitcoin. The utility of a decentralized currency such as Bitcoin is a replacement of the entire institution of Banking. Viva the march of technology.

I am satisfied with their service however they are small.

One thing to consider. Satoshi is a genius. Someone with such brilliant insight into a wide array of topics and a desire to remain anonymous could easily have created sloppy code. He knew it was going to be read and analyzed, it's open source. Realizing this makes an analysis of the coding technique less insightful.

If bitcoin goes up then the valuation of the stock goes down as it becomes overpriced.

On the other hand I have purchased products priced in bitcoin and I intend to do so in the future regardless of price. The whole idea of being involved in an emerging market is very exciting.

If you have lower commission rates than the ridiculous 3% monopoly rates I pay now with cavirtex, you will have all of my business.

I have a lot of respect for this guy. I read the entire dialogue between him and Satoshi. He was the first person to accept Bitcoin from Satoshi and one of the very few people in the world with the technical chops (PGP), activist philosophy (cyberpunk) and general genius to pull off Bitcoin.
I believe Hal Finney IS Satoshi Nakamoto.

I have been pleased with the site so far. I would like to see them launch more IPOs in the coming months/years.

Nice I was going to purchase one for my desk at work but $7 for 2 stickers? too expensive..

This is true. I have never sold my Bitcoins or my gold.
@_date: 2013-02-07 22:29:36
Please come in and eat cavirtex's lunch. Teach them that Canada is a land of innovation, rather than a land of monopolies and over priced goods and services.
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:49:15
They just had their IPO which sold out quickly and I realized something. They operate in perhaps the most financially stable country in the world and they are a market innovator therefore they can and do charge a premium for their services. If there was competition in the market then I think they would lower their commission fees and happily do so because they would still be very profitable. The problem with Canada is that it is a small market. This means that competition would be welcome for all parties.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:02:50
The accurate price is what a buyer is willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:59:32
I would say that I have also been very satisfied, I have never experience significant delay in transferring funds. The service seems reliable to the point that I bought shares in the company which is trading here:
