Just looking at sell orders. Pointless walls set up.

No way ETH alone is causing this. Numbers don't match up.

Mine was $35 (SegWit). Confirmed in minutes though.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:35:34
Honestly, who the fuck would sell BTC right now
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:59:35
This isn't a or thing - this is fucking sketchy.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:26:46
Ooh! I got a good one.
Transaction fees.

If you think Ethereum will somehow hold up and rise from the ashes if BTC crashes tomorrow you are seriously deluded...
@_date: 2018-09-25 03:32:43
I didn't. Twas a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:37:22
They're literally deluding people...

Damn shills...

Nine separate tradable indexes. Two (now three) ETF companies (ProShares, Direxion, and GraniteShares)

The risk is insanely high since BCH will most likely decline greatly in value afterwards. If you were some large-scale mining facility it would be suicide to switch into BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:39:37
Correct, but this price push was only due to speculation from the difficulty adjustment. Could sustain but there's always possible failure.

You're losing WAY more than you're earning unless you have a flat/free electricity. Even then you're better off mining altcoins.

Index is weighted by marketcap so most of it is just BTC anyways. And remember the index fund is aimed at institutional money that has no idea how to deal with digital assets so it's a super easy way for wall street investors to get in. Not huge news but still progress.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:17:05
Even then you can migrate value between old and new if needed...

I am done with shittrex. Use Binance.

Kraken no longer accepts USD, last time I checked.

Tom Lee went back on CNBC to clarify that his estimate was misinterpreted. He still fully believes BTC will go to 25k, 20k was just a different estimate based on mining rewards.

I've been waiting for over a week and haven't gotten verified. Having been a long-time customer if they don't do it fast enough I'll probably ditch and join Gemini instead.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:37:29
Wow, that sucks :( I sold out most of my BTC a while ago, and the exchanges I used to use shut down a while ago.

It's not really literal, it's often used as a substitute for "success" on the internet.

Coinbase has been having a lot of problems lately, from what I've heard...
@_date: 2017-06-01 23:09:43
Not really possible for people trying to get into BTC... they have the fastest verification and it's really the only way to buy with credit card for many. Although once you have more options definitely switch.
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:27:23
I have no idea what my password is...
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:37:39
Ok bot
@_date: 2017-06-01 23:07:19
Yep. I use Google Auth on everything and it seems to be way more secure.
