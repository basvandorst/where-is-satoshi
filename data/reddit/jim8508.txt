Sorry OP, I think the movie went over your head and you missed a bit.
What BTC needs right now are financial instruments (AKA ways to incur debt) right now it has very few which limits its fungibility and its adoption.
This movie is a cautionary tale/post mortem warning you of the risks around not enough regulation on those same instruments.
This could happen with a BTC based economy as easily as it could with FIAT,

Don't vote for Rand solely on his enthusiasm for BTC  - money is like a drug to a politician, they will take it from any source they can get it. Please just do not take the stance, "let the world burn, as long as what's left will accept bitcoin for payment, I'm in!"
Life is complex and you need to look at the bigger picture.
Where does he [stand on the environment?]( 
[How about the separation of church and state?](
[Where is he on universal tolerance for all races, sexes, and religions?](
[How about basic science)?] (
[What about abortion?]{
[How about foreign policy?]( 
[Does he pander for votes - just for the sake of getting them?](
Bitcoin is great, but let it succeed on it's own merits - don't try to fast-track it by voting for a power hungry, heir-apparent by way of  another dynasty. (C'mon, if his dad was not in the Senate, he never would have had a chance, and would probably be selling shoes at a DSW shoe outlet.) Fucking entitled little shit!

But mining is part of the fun! 
Though given, it's stressful, brutal, and everything you said, it is the heart of what makes BTC as a currency work.
How can you contribute at this point without producing another monolithic infrastructure?
