A rise of $200 in price would mean a rise of $3.5b in market cap. The ratio of market cap to actual money invested is 50-1 according to Tom $15,000-by-year-end Lee. So the answer is about ~~tree fiddy~~ $70m.

He was predicting a $10m Bitcoin in 2009


becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world.  Then the
total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all
the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household
wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With
20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.

@_date: 2018-07-22 01:49:08
An ETF kinda defeats the purpose of Bitcoin which is a decentralized, trustless and censorship-resistant currency. It's only good for price speculation but not very useful in an economy crisis.
@_date: 2019-05-02 06:19:16

Your Coinbase account and the Bitcoin blockchain are two different things. If you have $15 in your account it doesn't mean that there's an address on the blockchain with exactly $15 in it but it's more likely that your Bitcoin are pooled with other user's Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-12-24 10:41:33
That's just the change that goes back to Coinbase (not an extra fee).
Let's say you have $20 in BTC. If you wanted to send $15 to someone, you would actually have to send the whole $20 in one transaction: $15 to the recipient's address and $5 to an address that you own (change address).

I agree that at this time Bitcoin is not very useful as a currency due to the volatility. But there are already countries that don't use cash anymore like Sweden (mainly credit cards) and some Asian countries (mainly mobile payments). On the other hand, there are countries like Germany (where I'm from) where cash is still king and not even the post office will accept credit cards lol

Bitcoin is a currency not a collector's item. When we pay with our credit card or mobile phone it's also virtual.
