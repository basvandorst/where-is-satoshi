I pinged their twitter accounts several times but it was probably just a waiting game.

Hang tight, it'll happen.  Keep in mind that all of the exchanges worldwide are being hammered with requests for signups, etc.  Mine took a month.  I understand your frustration but be patient...

After 30 something days they finally got me verified.

I got some automated messages from Bittrex support the other day on two of the tickets I opened, but not on my first ticket which I opened back on October 31st or so...  Their automated updates basically said, sorry but we've been overwhelmed and are working to ramp up support, etc...
I took the advice of Clapyourhandssayyeah above and sent a tweet at them which got retweeted (I assume someone from Bittrex support or management retweeted it to someone who could assist).  Check his links and try that to see if you get retweeted.
I've opened 4 tickets so far, one got auto resolved (they just closed the ticket immediately), and my oldest ticket sits with only one reply (the automated reply from when I first opened the ticket.)

Thanks for the commiseration and advice.  I reset my twitter account, posted a comment, and somebody retweeted it so maybe the tweet got passed along to somebody who can help out with it.  Told them my ticket number.  Let's hope it works.

I don't do twitter, but it looks like I got two emails from Bittrex support updating a few of the tickets I opened and I replied to them asking them to please help facilitate the process for me.  Crossing my fingers!  Thanks for the links and maybe I'll set up a twitter account to ping them.
Frustrating thing about this all is they made their slack chat private for enhanced verified people only so I can't ping them there and they closed their reddit chat as well.
Wish me luck!

Correct, still not verified though...
