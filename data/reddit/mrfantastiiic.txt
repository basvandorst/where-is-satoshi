I have and it looked a little too complicated. Plus I just want a one off service to mix the coins. Ill definitely look into it if I'm planning on mixing more often but until then I just want a one off service, thanks

I did and it says i need a minimum of bitcoins to be able to join in and it was like 0.09983 or so and I do not have that much in my wallet nor do I want to withdraw that much just to be able to mix them. What should I 6di?

That's what I thought at first but if you visit the trusted website "deepdotweb" and you click on "btc mixer" it takes you to the page. Plus im just looking for a one off service that's quick and easy. Thanks

Ok so im watching a guide and it says the minimum to tumble them in wasabi wallet is 0.09983 which is 554 aud. I only have around 160 that I want to mix, what should I do?

So what you're saying is that I just have to use wasabi once then after that I'm able to mix the bitcoins from my phone from electrum?

Ohh wwow I've never looked at it like that. I guess I'll look into it. The only reason I don't want to use wasabi is because I dont have anywhere to download it. I dont currently have a laptop and when I do end up getting it back it will be the day I end up using the bitcoins. So i just kind of wanted to prepare the bitcoins so when I get the laptop I can just use them. Does it take hours, days to mix them or is it sort of instant when you mix them using wasabi? Thanks

Ohh yeah I get you. Sorry I'm just a noob at this stuff. I guess my new problem is that I need to send a minimum of 0.09983 btc to wasabi for me to join the mixing pool which is too much for me. I just wanted to mix around $120 usd but that's too low. Any other alternatives? Thanks
