You can play on FanDuel by paying with paypal and they payout via paypal within 2 days or maybe even a day. 
It's not like online poker in the USA where bitcoin is acutally useful (shoutout to swc2) because you can't get money in and out.
Another one of these articles that's long on the blah blah but when it comes down to it is vapid and meaningless.

I'm into solar, and no, nothing is free.  It takes energy to refine silicon and put it into solar panels, energy to make the pure sine wave inverters,  batteries, the copper wires, etc,etc, etc.
Just because they had an inrush of wind power which brought temporary negative electricity rates, it still took energy to make those wind towers and raise them, and maintain them, etc
eventually you recoup the energy input to make it

The sign is actually false.  You can't send any amount in bitcoins (What if I want to send $10 billion?  Suppose I'm a bored Koch brother).  The market cap is ~$5 billion.  A lot of bitcoins are being saved, and haven't moved in a long time, so maybe it's closer to $4 billion.

It's telling  how bitcoiners always ignore the 34% attack , and only focus on the 51% attack.  Take 2 pools with ~17% and combine them to conspire, and there you have it.

No it doesn't. If the miners can't agree to a simple change in max blocksize over the last 6 months or so, they'll never agree to a change in POW algorithm.
Maybe you should look up "ossified". because that's what SHA-256 is.

I concur.  I played Bitcoin Poker for 4 years and it's not going anywhere.  It's had plenty of time to "take off".  It should have taken off after Black Friday, but it never really did.  The same 200 people play on SWC, and that's not changing.  Other bitcoin poker sites (bitcasino.io, burnturn.eu) were total fails.

Yeah right, wait 10 minutes for each fucking action in a poker hand.  Imagine one poker hand.  Wait 10 minutes to raise, 10 minutes for the flop, 10 minutes for the turn, 10 minutes for the river.  Oh? You want a server to handle that ?  Now it's centralized.

I know I'm a buttcoiner but to be fair to sportsbook and merge and those other sites, they do pay.  Most of my payouts are &lt; $500 though.  When you see stories about non-payment, you have to take them with a grain of salt.  Many times somebody did something shady, like making a correlated parlay, or betting on red and black in roulette to work through a wagering requirement rollover.
Lately they've just been taking 2.5- 3 months, they used to take like 2-3 weeks.  This is acutally one use of bitcoin I can get behind!
EDIT: I don't know how it works on sportsbook, but on 5Dimes (at least 4 months ago), when you deposit by bitcoin, and actually win money, you have to break up your cashout into 2 cashouts (I know, lame): A bitcoin cashout for the initial bitcoin deposit amount (not sure how 
they handle fluctuations), and a fiat cashout for the reaminder.
Hopefully sportsbook.ag and 5Dimes change this behavior.

except there is a limit of 100,000,000 units per bitcoin (called satoshis).  And to increase that, some kind of modification to bitcoin is needed (soft fork or hard fork?).  Look at how much they have argued over max_block_size

Capitalism hasn't grinded to a halt - not yet - not while existing reserves and resources have yet to be expended.  What will grind capitalism to a halt  is the finite nature of this planet, which implies limits to growth, and the overshoot of our species.
