I mean, they did literally manipulate their currency. It was all retaliatory to the tariffs, and a pretty amazing power move on their part. “Trump keeps calling us ‘currency manipulators’? Fine you want currency manipulators, we’ll fucking give you currency manipulators you petulant baby.”

Holy crap I’ve never seen the whole thing, and did that song just rip off Pirates of the Caribbean?!

Second the good backups. I lost my wallet with a failed HD and can’t recover. Only had about 10BTC, and I would love even a small percent of that back. At least I’m helping drive up the price?

@_date: 2019-05-11 06:59:38
Anyone know or have a theory what’s driving this surge?

Wasn't ING bought out by Capitol One?

I did “what is bitcoin” and then “how to buy bitcoin”

I live right across GGP from there in the richmond, I'll definitely try to make it.

Of course... all the more reason why we (I) need bit coin.
