dugmartsch is exactly right. There's a myth about [Executive Order 11110]( based on a complete misunderstanding of what it was about.
JFK wanted to *stop printing silver certificates*. Congress passed a law at his request. The same day he signed the law, which removed the Treasury Secretary's authority to print silver certificates, he issued the order which delegated the president's authority under another law, so that the Treasury could keep printing silver certificates *until the new $1 and $5 Federal Reserve notes were ready*. It was never meant to be a permanent measure.
Here's a newspaper article from the time:
["Kennedy Signs Silver Bill"](  
*Spokane Daily Chronicle*, June 6, 1963, p. 34










That last line is about Executive Order 11110.
G. Edward Griffin, author of the anti-Fed book, *The Creature from Jekyll Island*, also rejects the theory that Executive Order 11110 had anything to do with Kennedy's assassination. See his article, ["The JFK Myth"](

Washington didn't reject central banking, he created the first Bank of the United States. Franklin wasn't a president, nor did he ever say anything negative about banks (central or otherwise), that I'm aware of. Lincoln wasn't anti-bank, either.
Jackson was anti-bank.
So, that's one.
