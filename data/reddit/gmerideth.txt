What's weird and expected is I have two accountants telling me two different things.  The hard-fork to the IRS is basically, you got more money whether you used it or not so you need to declare it.
Not sure there's one solid answer.

A friend of mine while on vacation in St. Thomas had to wait three hours to confirm a large jewelry purchase through his bank.  After the first four calls from the bank they then waited another hour, called him again to confirm.  With Bitcoin he could have paid, waited 10 minutes for a confirm and then we could have left.

I know the Facebook account data for at least 10 of my clients as I've integrated Wordpress to their company pages - that, combined with having 10-15 credit cards for those clients on file and wow...I can start making some bitcoin.  Facebook as a verification process is horrible.

That's what I was afraid of.  At least he understands what the fee's are for now.

I provided the transaction which includes the amount he was sending and the fee the bitcoin-ui client provided.  It includes where it came from and where it's going to.
What else do you need?

How many people would it take running the code/miners to disrupt the current system?  Could one person sending out a fork do any damage?  Would it take hundreds, thousands?

Can't a bitcoin payment be listed on a ledger the same way a check would be?  Or is this more of a "i just don't want to have to explain this to anyone" situation?

My withdrawal took 4 hours.  I've had longer times waiting from other exchanges so meh...

I was thinking along the lines of states that confiscate your car/house if you are involved in a drug raid and use it for themselves.  Given what they got the bitcoins from to begin with I figured they would just use it on the spot.
