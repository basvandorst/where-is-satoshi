So thanks for your help clarifying that one.
By the way, I also testified for the FTC voluntarily against the notorious Butterfly Labs to help bring them down. I worked for them as marketing manager for a brief period of time.

If I had the same questions about them I would. But we're talking about BFX and tether right now, not any other Exchange. I'm not going to fall for the trap of "what about all these other exchanges", I'm asking for bitfinex right now. Other people are too.
As much as I want to engage you along that route through the straw man argument fields, I'm not going to play the what about game.
You can take that somewhere else. I am equally critical about anything that doesn't seem right, it just so happens that BFX  doesn't seem right and hasn't seemed right since the hack of 2016 at least.

He has a multi-year history of sucking Phil Potter's cock and being their little flying monkeys when shit hits the fan like the hack. Maybe you should listen to the podcast where Phil gets tipsy and tells them to go on Reddit and counter with bullshit around that time.
Regardless, he's not an auditor and he is not neutral in any way. It is absolutely in his best interest to keep pushing the company line for bitfinex.

I forget. With all this conspiratorial nonsense, are you speaking of Roger Ver or Blockstream/Adam Back as a puppeteer slave master? I just want to be sure since both cases can be made.
And you know what happens to technology that doesn't change to fit it's original vision or innovate in any way? It becomes obsolete. This can be seen time and again throughout history from Betamax/VHS to BluRay/HD-DVD. The best technology doesn't always win out in some cases, and another technology comes out that does what the previous one did better in others. Technology is always evolving, that's what is so great about it!
I've always said, and so have many others, that Bitcoin could be the MySpace to the next Facebook, whatever that might be. At one time the thought was ETH could be the FB, but that doesn't seem to correlate over time. 
But that doesn't mean something else can't come out or is already out that does what Bitcoin does better, especially when Bitcoin as a whole has been bogged down and fractured as a community for years.

True about tipbot. I wouldn't discount that there aren't paid shills as I have been in this game and seen it happen in many subs, crypto or not. There are probably some on here as well and I've identified a few over the years, mostly in There are a lot of people looking for lower cost alternative cryptos to transfer money and quicker transaction times. The only difference is the ideological battle between BCH and BTC. Nobody is attacking Litecoin for low cost, quick transactions or ETH. Just BCH.
My question is why do people care? Bitcoin has gone up immensely compared to BCH, even after the attempted "flippening" so why does anyone care what they do or whether people use it or advocate it. There is room for both parties in the club, just like LTC, ETH and many other cryptos. The war between both sides of BTC and BCH isn't doing either any favors and many points argued against can be also argued against .
Can't we all just get along? I started here in BTC, I still love it, but I'm not blind to other alternatives nor stuck in an ideological paradigm. There are many different intrinsic values to various cryptos, and to deny such is being willfully ignorant and not any better than what the OG poster claims.
Thanks for your reasoned and 
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:46:07
While I don't believe that's a very good analogy, I'll try to play along and I appreciate your effort at making a coherent argument. 
By selling that vase, you put a price tag on it, therefore making it a legitimate quantity that you sold from yourself to another person. Before that, it had no value except as a possession that may or may not provide light should you need it at some point. It was just a lamp that you had lying around. Technically, the lamp has already proven its worth as a useful device because it provides light, but it had no value to you lying around. But when you sold it to someone else, you validated it's worth as a lamp and a producer of light and it regained its value to someone else.
So yes, while I think your analogy is bad, I can still turn it into an argument of legitimizing a worthless asset. You didn't lower its value, in fact you gave it value now.
I want to be clear on one point, however. I believe everyone should have access to make whatever decisions they want to with whatever Bitcoin Fork they receive. If you look at my post history, I was outspoken about how coinbase made a terrible business decision trying to not distribute bch back in August, which took threats of lawsuits for them to finally implement. 
The problem I have is some people trying to compare what we all know, but some people won't admit, are largely inferior forks who have very little utility or innovation and vastly inferior community support compared to BCH.
Thanks for the info on Bitcoin Diamond. While I try to follow all of the different Forks that have come out it has become a bit tiresome, and generally all of my Bitcoin is hidden under multiple bird baths and I don't plan on splitting it anytime soon.
Final point, Bitcoin is meant to be your own bank. If Trezor doesn't support a fork, then you have given up your right to be your own bank at that point. While there are other ways to recover your airdrops, I wouldn't count on a company to support the whim of every Bitcoin or cryptocurrency enthusiast.
In conclusion, I appreciate your reasoned response even if I do not agree with it entirely. While it's obvious that this thread was not started to encourage positive discussion, at least you and I seem to have found a middle ground or understand each other and our positions possibly. Or at the very least have a discussion without personal attacks and alt-right slang. So there's that...
Edit: I just realized I mixed vase with lamp in various parts of trying to work with your analogy. I believe the same principle still applies whether it holds flowers or provides light.

There are more grains of sense in a box of Minute Rice than your comment.
Who are these volunteers you are talking about? Did they go to the University of Tennessee?
Of course it's about centralizing power, that's how everything works when it turns out to be worth money somehow. Look at all the various monopolies in different industries for comparison.
In reality, Bitcoin tried to centralize power first and Bitcoin Cash broke away from that. Is there centralization of power in both? Absolutely. The question is, which currency is hurt worst by the centralization of power and so far the answer has been Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:10:10
I'm fairly sure this poster who has only been on Reddit for 6 weeks is a troll.
Otherwise, how do you explain this? 
Apparently Bitcoin Cash is fake, but Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin God, Bitcoin Diamond, and Bitcoin WTF seem to be real to this poster and he wants Trezor to support them.
That totally makes sense. Not to mention his bombastic alt-right language and inability to understand open source code.

If you look at the link, the poster specifically states that Bitcoin Diamond of all things seems to be the best fork. 
So I guess it's okay for you guys to claim your free money from all the these fraudulent Forks, but then trash them and claim the most fraudulent are somehow more real than bitcoin cash. That totally makes sense.
Edit: also, if trezor was to support these forks it would give them legitimacy that you guys don't want because they're fake right? You just want them to be legitimate enough to make your money and then be out.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:44:03
Well you didn't respond to the first argument I made, so what's the point of continuing this? You're just going to keep asking questions down the rabbit hole. Once again, you are the exact stereotype the writer is talking about with your comments so far.
Once again, you're making false equivalencies. And your straw man arguments, you actually have a central governing body to go to starting with your bank and moving up to credit reporting agencies or authorities. This can even be confirmed, as opposed to the alleged bitfinex hack last year.
And Bitcoin is by far not the most secure or safest means of wealth storage and transport. It's just more accessible than other options to most people. Most people can't even make it through a self-checkout Lane by themselves, let alone set up a Bitcoin wallet and transfer funds correctly. This has been documented extensively in this subreddit and bitcointalk and many other places since the beginning of Bitcoin.
Stop making equivalencies and accept that there are issues with Bitcoin. It is not infallible by any means, yet I see people here act like it was brought from the heavens through Jesus to Satoshi Nakamoto.

Please tell me how you derive any of that from my post. Also, please tell me exactly what points you disagree with and provide examples discounting what I posted.
I am a realist. I believe in the original vision of Bitcoin. I believe both Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash adhere to that original ideology that brought me in to learning about this in 2012, although there are contentious points of argument. I am admittedly biased towards one side now but believe both can coexist for different purposes.
To call me a leftist for buying into the ultimate experimental libertarian cryptocurrency 5 years ago when it was less than $7 and continuing to work in that space for years by mining and advising private clients and investment firms on cryptocurrency is asinine.
But your username explains your way of thinking well enough already, and I imagine you showed up just because you had a filter on Reddit for the word "cuck." So go make America great again or read through my other posts throughout the six years of my history on Reddit and Bitcoin. Go check out Bitcointalk as well just for fun. I have nothing to hide.
Some of you ungrateful fucks don't know how many people worked behind the scenes to make Bitcoin profitable for you greedy assholes five years later.
Edit: I just looked through your comment history. [This]( comment shows you don't understand what Bitcoin was originally even meant to be and are part of the new wave goalpost moving crowd.
EDIT 2: just when I thought it couldn't get worse I found [this]( comment from you.
NOBODY should take the opinion of someone who advocates sterilizing unwed mothers seriously and should greatly question their moral compass. That sounds quite an authoritarian action of someone who supposedly believes in a decentralized currency and whose post history seems to advocate for limited government intervention. But I guess that only counts when it involves women's bodies or gay people or a countless number of other things. Typical cognitive bias.

Once again, you have absolutely no counter-argument and resort to simple ad hominem attacks rather than addressing anything with facts. Let's just be honest here, you're outmatched and have no idea what you're doing. You bought some Bitcoin a couple weeks ago and it went up by double and now you think you're the Wolf of Wall Street. In reality, you have shown an absolute lack of knowledge or ability to have a reasonable discussion, let alone make a counter argument.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:14:35
Possibly. Still a meager wage if the claim is that they are being bought. How many tips were going around here when the tipbot was working a couple years ago? Does that mean everyone here was getting paid to be a shill? No.
They brought the tipbot back, which everyone in this sub loved at the time it was here, because it was useful again and showed an example of how you could move small transactions for low cost on BCH.
Using the tipbot as a divining rod and absolute evidence that they are all shills is specious at best, and disinformation at worst. Which doesn't make this sub any better, as the OG poster seemed to posit.

You made a specific comment stating that Bitcoin diamond is the best of all Forks. That is one of the single dumbest comments I have seen, and you have made a lot of dumb comments in such a short time.
And really, get over yourself new redditor. You're aggressive language, blatant disinformation and misunderstanding of how Forks and open source software works tells everyone what they need to know about your agenda.
And I'm not a "Bcasher", I'm a realist who has been in this game much longer than you. I can hold both and be perfectly happy, but I'm not going to be blind to the downsides of either. 
You can check my post history, it goes back 6 years nearly. I've been mining, working, and consulting in the cryptocurrency world for 5 years.
I can speak logically and make sound arguments and have seen the evolution of Bitcoin since the beginning.

You can use open source code for all sorts of things, even if you don't like the original product that you used the source code from. If they were adding features similar to what Bitcoin is doing right now, you would have a point, but they aren't, so you don't.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:22:34
Ridiculous argument. Why fork off of a fork, when you can fork the original. That has absolutely nothing to do with the technical competence of anyone involved. It's basic math considering Bitcoin has the most users and the longest blockchain due to its legacy.
Just about anyone can Fork off the main blockchain, not many people can fork off of forks and that doesn't make sense in the first place anyways.

I was going to write some long-winded reply, but when it comes down to it, as usual, greed triumphs reason.
You can't even understand the simple concept that by supporting something, you are legitimizing it. How long do you think Trezor is going to keep adding shitcoins from airdrops that are only going to be used once to withdraw and never again? Where is the line? 
People bitch that there are too many forked coins now, but those same people that are the first in line for their handouts.
You can vote all you want with your $35 worth of bitcoin diamond, the going price right now, but someday you'll look back and wonder why there's also 35 different versions of Bitcoin.
That's the day you'll realize you were part of screwing up Bitcoin and sold your soul and integrity for $35 to some con men in the night.

I'm going to keep this to one post comment now but I think you are parsing  language here. I have never seen you come out and say that Eligius was not involved, only that they were not "adversely impacted" by that. There is some other questionable language in there too, but you already know that.
So how did you take it down then if you didn't attack it? You claimed you were against it and then it was attacked, you admitted you did it and then held it hostage. It's all in that thread. That is the manner of which I speak.

The IRS guidance played into it as well. While it can be worked around, it is still an impediment to an already technically complex currency to understand and use for the mainstream.

It did, and I think Josh was actually honest for once when he announced it late 2013/early 2014. The problem lies with their chip designer as flawed chips were the same issue with the 65nm miners and then it was a flawed PCB board design that kept setting them back the same way it did this time. They learned nothing from the 65nm debacle and didn't really seem to care to learn. Just wanted to lock in everyone's money before other miner manufacturers came along. Customer put up with this crap during the 65nm design phase because they didn't really have  a choice, but a ton of manufacturers have come online since then and shown them how real business is conducted.

Obviously ASIC support hasn't been that great either which is why we are flooded with Ghash.io posts now and FUD.
Comparative to the coins I mentioned and most of the rest of the crap alts out there, Darkcoin is innovative. I don't think it's going to overtake Litecoin anytime soon though and something else will come along that is better than both of them and possibly even Bitcoin, maybe.
And I'm not sure Luke Jr is the best at detecting pump and dumps or scams, as Litecoin is still around and going strong. My point is that in a free market an idea/business will survive or die on its own and people will get burned and learn from it. Hell, we may all be burned by Bitcoin in a worst case scenario and there are some people who bought in the $1000's that think they are already burned.
Should CoiledCoin have died? Yes. Did they really need his intervention to hasten it? Not really, because then the investors don't learn anything and find another coin that ends up being a scam because Luke Jr saved them once and hasn't attacked a coin again as far as I know.

"Since Coiledcoin launched with merged mining, Luke Jr was able to use Eligius' combined hashing power to execute a 51% attack against the new block chain. Additionally, the Eligius-mined blocks contained no transactions, effectively slowing the function of the Coiledcoin network to a crawl."
Edit: Not to mention the whole BFL shipping debacle last year where they claimed they shipped and he claimed he got it, but it was in BFL's lab the whole time. All to get out of paying a bet on BFL's part too. That's not very Christian.

In their defense, they are talking about downsizing after the 65nm product line was done. However, now they have another backlog of 28nm Monarch orders which they are around 6 months late on again because they had chip troubles again and it was delayed and whenever they get that figured out, the proverbial two weeks, they will hire more back on.

At that time, ASIC resistance was an advantage. It took them a long time to make a Scrypt ASIC due to interest/market and some thought it could never be done. Darkcoin is one of the more innovative currencies, although as I said I'm not a fan. They're probably more likely susceptible to a pump and dump than Litecoin. But at least they are trying to fill a niche rather than these other random coins with colors like Blackcoin, Whitecoin, Orangecoin, UnicornCoin, etc.
But once again, this is true free market economics at hand. There were plenty of pump and dumps then and are now. They will fail or succeed on their own merits. Some malicious actors will influence that. It just so happens that Luke Jr was one of those people.

It puts his story out there from none other than his mother and gives more of a human angle to the story of Gox, rather than just being the guy with the Frappacinos who "lost" a bunch of other people's money.
I don't think it will work as it is too late and no matter what was/is/may be wrong with him from a mental/developmental standpoint, there should have been other checks and balances in place at Gox and at some point he had to have known there was something drastically wrong with his business.

@_date: 2014-04-24 21:32:34
Let's be honest, this is a crappy article that should have never made it to the front page but probably did because of the BFL hatewagon.
But you have heard about the testnet, right? Maybe you should do some research on that and while you are at it look up the public statements by BFL indicating that they don't test on the network. It's bad business to lie to your customers and the public.
They probably aren't the only one's to do it too, but they had less leeway to do things like this due to their reputation, delays, and the legal troubles of their primary shareholder/innovation officer.
You know what would have been good business? To do something like Bitfury and MegaBigPower did and burn in machines on their customers Bitcoin addresses. That's a good business idea and Bitfury wasn't really even late, maybe a couple weeks at most.

It doesn't have anything to do with Bitcoin except that Bitcoin involves money and money brings bad people, or "actors" into the fray. I look at it like the Wild West during the Gold Rush with everyone coming through town selling snake oil. Pirateat40, BFL, Hashfast, Gox, etc.. and the Silk Road is another issue.

You know where we need the big boys to play in besides Wall St and the Bitcoin market? Real, experienced businesses who take the risk of making a product and then selling it to people, rather than the other way around. We need companies who know how to handle customer service and not look down on their customers, the one's who made them all that money, as greedy peons who are lucky to get one of their super awesome totes fantastic boxes of unicorns and fans. THAT's what we need in Bitcoin as well.

Litecoin used to have advantages then and if it is a pump and dump then it is one of the longest pump and dumps ever. I don't believe it will stay  for long but that's because if innovation like Darkcoin and not manipulation. I'm not even a Litecoin or Darkcoin fan and never gave a crap about CoiledCoin, but the way he went about it was wrong. 
Pool operators, which he was and technically is still in the hierarchy of Eligius, should not behave in that manner, especially without his clientele knowing about it. Maybe they held some CoiledCoin at that time and their own resources were being used against them? There are so many ethical quandaries to even verge into that territory. But he did.

All cryptocurrency could be considered speculative if you want to take that route. I don't know why you are arguing that he claimed the second largest coin is a pump and dump scam over a year ago when it is still the second largest coin today. He was wrong, plain and simple.
1.) Is true, whether you think it is misleading or not. He performed a 51% attack against another crypto. Not many other people can say that.
3.) I guarantee you that unit never left the building. Unfortunately, I don't want to get into how I know that. You can believe what you want, but I will believe what I know and saw with my own eyes.
As for borrowing code, sure it is allowed but when you get caught and then lie about it rather than being honest, well, that doesn't look good, whether it is GPL or not, and goes against your argument of him being honest.
When it comes down to it, Luke Jr is far from a white knight or as honest as you claimed and is an incredibly polarizing figure in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:44:07
Unfortunately it seems that way. Marco Santori, one of the few legal and regulatory experts and chairman of the regulatory board at the Bitcoin Foundation summed it up best, but I don't think the reality has hit home for some people or they think this will be just another impediment. But this is a government time impediment and who knows how long it will take and if they will change their guidance after some discussions with the Bitcoin Foundation like other regulatory agencies have done. Or maybe they will just wait until next year or the flood of revised tax returns this year to see just how hard this will be. "We're the IRS. F You" is pretty much their motto.
Somebody is going to be making a lot of money putting a program together to keep track of all this (startup idea!), auditing taxes for the government, and accountants in general. The miners like me are getting especially screwed from what I've seen and I already have to amend my return now for 2013.

I've always said these people weren't on the up and up. Now they finally pissed off the wrong person. 
I've said it once and I'll say it a million times, developing ASIC mining equipment is rather revolutionary, but customer service, finding your own financing, public relations, communications, etc. have been proven over and over again. This is not reinventing the wheel here.
Even in these early stages of Bitcoin, if you are starting a mining company, the example of what NOT to be is BFL. Hashfast went out and seemed to have copied their blueprints, except they don't have a childish COO who goes around berating customers and being an internet tough guy on wwebsites.
It is long past the time that customers need to be shouldering the risk for companies and this should be like any other industry as we have matured. You, as an entrepreneur, go out and get the financial backing either through bank loans or private financing and YOU take the risk if you don't deliver or Bitcoin goes down, not the customer.

Who made Luke Jr. the cryptocurrency sheriff? He also called Litecoin a pump and dump scam coin last year and was wrong.
Regardless, his actions have proven that:
1.) He performed a 51% attack successfully using Eligius at the time
2.) He did not disclose any of this to the miners there at the time
3.) He will lie if given enough incentive
One more thing, he has shown that he will steal code like he did from CGminer for his BFGminer software. That is old news by now and somewhat contentious but still something that mars his reputation.
@_date: 2014-06-14 09:18:27
So you are saying that Eligius was not involved in any way then? They were completely separate?
I do know more about what was going on inside BFL. They probably didn't tell you the whole story, which wouldn't be a surprise to anyone, not even you and I don't fault you for that. But they had a bet that they would ship and that bet got voided because of the shenanigans with you that you either directly or indirectly played a part in it.
I really don't have much of a problem with you and only brought this up when someone brought up the subject of your honesty and thought that while Reddit was on the Ghash.io kick then they should know about your history as well. I, personally, don't believe you've been honest at times or have engaged in using weasel words. You've done a lot of good for the community, which I appreciate, and you have also done some things that I think are highly questionable, which I don't appreciate. Then again, somehow nearly everyone in the Bitcoin community could fall under that categorization.

While this may not be a popular opinion, very early customers of BFL would have ROI'd even when the price was at $100/BTC and I imagine some later on did when the price went over $1000.

I agree with that, but the rest of the world looks like it may be in for trouble if the US and China(depending on the day/week) don't have as much skin in the game or continue to regulate it in vague, conflicting ways. The market cap drops, innovation opportunities are not as open, etc. We're all in this together, in my opinion. With the exception of China, screw them.

The pace of ASIC development has had a dramatic impact on mining, much more so than GPU mining. Yes, it has been a problem before with Deepbit, but we didn't have these industrial mining warehouse operations that we do now.
Litecoin is not a pump and dump or scam. I don't even know why you're still giving that theory credence. The market barely moves most days and is almost directly tied to Bitcoin price movements.
If his motives were altruistic, then why has that been the only time he did that when there are plenty of real pump and dump scam coins out there?

I'll wait for the final audit report before coming to a full conclusion.
I'm not even saying tether is lying, I'm just saying they have been suspicious with their handling of the issuance and the blowback that tether has drawn.
Furthermore, they are owned by BFX and they have their own issues that are suspect.
I don't even believe tether has no money, but I do wonder if it is a fractional reserve. It's good to see that they do have money in their accounts, the question is how long has it been there and how long will it stay. Hopefully the Auditors can clear that up, something I think bitfinex and tether and the community as a whole would appreciate and want.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:35:07
I never said gdax did use Tethers. They're a legitimate exchange with legitimate on-ramps and off-ramps for banking partnerships. No legitimate exchange accepts tethers. What does that tell you?
But you know what? You can buy other coins with tethers and send them to gdax and THEN buy BTC &amp; prop up the market that way as well. And guess what, most of the exchanges that accept tethers are kind of shady or bucket shops as well. 
You're wrong about Facebook. They are a publicly traded company and therefore have to open their books. This is why they have earnings calls and statements and all of the things that normal companies do. They actually have shareholders and the SEC that they have to report to. While you would be laughed out of the room, it would mostly be because your example is terrible.
There still has been no true audit of tethers and Bitfinex has shown bad behavior in the past, which is generally indicative of future performance. So pardon me if I err on the side of Occam's razor and their history.
I'm not even suggesting using any other specific exchange, just that you shouldn't use bitfinex until they answer the questions about tether and the hack from last year, among other things. Don't use Kraken either because they suck.
And yet asking for concrete answers and pointing to the lack of transparency regarding these facts is now considered FUD. Are we living in opposite world?

Understood. I was a little confused by what you meant. And I agree.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:41:37
Which rally? I've seen both GDAX and Bitfinex lead at times in the past two days. This is irrelevant anyways as you could always move Tethers into Bitcoin or send Tethers themselves to other exchanges to manipulate the price as well.  
You know what WOULD calm any "alleged" Tethers/Bitfinex FUD?
Transparency. A real audit. An accounting of what happened in the hack last year from both Bitfinex and government authorities. They may or may not have done something wrong, but there is a lot of smoke and past performance is indicative of future behaviour.
Your anecdotal evidence is very poor and shows how many people are grasping for straws for reassurance. Bitfinex could easily provide this for everyone to see and I imagine Bitcoin would skyrocket without this lurking in the shadows anymore, but yet we get posts like this...

I understand that you live in a utopian world where that ideology works, but it doesn't in practice in  the evolution of Bitcoin mining.
You can essentially only buy miners from one company, bitmain. Avalon's are old and bitfury only does industrial mining. But that's it, that's all. I remember well the eraly days of Asic Mining and was part of it as I worked for butterfly labs. So now there's only really one competitor and guess what, they take Bitcoin cash only. Example one.
The pool straw man argument is ridiculous. It doesn't really matter anyways because large entities can split hashing power between pools. Although it's quite interesting that the largest mining manufacturer also owns the largest pool. Whether it is their own equipment or not, that's example two of centralization.
Other than that, I don't need an explanation how Bitcoin mining/pools works. I wrote weminecoins.com back in the day as it was a feeder site for bfl.
Currently and since those days I've worked as a consultant, and guess who is interested the most in buying Bitcoin mining equipment? People with a lot of money! Now think about how much of the world owns most of the money supply. Then they buy most of the miners and then they get most of the Bitcoin that is mined.
Now do you see what I'm saying? This is as if only Apple and Samsung made phones and nobody else did. The little guys get priced out and the rich keep getting richer. In the long run though, the rich people really value the money aspect while the hobbyist values the ideology and that is what makes cryptocurrency work. 
Ideologues will mine at a loss, businesses have much less tolerance when it comes to the bottom line.

Goal post moving? You seem to be tearing them down before the game is over. It always sucks having to put them back and then keep playing, especially if you lose.
NOTHING has been confirmed until the "audit" is done or a real audit is done. Until then, they are "alleged". You might want to look up what that means. You also took it completely out of context as I said "alleged Tether/Bitfinex FUD". So good job strawman, but I'm no crow.
I'm asking for cold hard facts and an audit that would pass muster for any business, especially a large exchange. You should too. Why do you NOT want to them to confirm this? Do you have an ulterior motive?
I don't. I'm just asking questions and getting innuendo and petty arguments. If there were facts, you could provide them, but as of yet nobody has, we just know that when the auditors looked there was money in the account. That's it. That's all. Anybody can play that little trick, especially when you have to learn to "bank like criminals" according to Phil Photter.
And lol at people coming to to "learn and share". Nice try to deflect through some sort of higher calling or pedagogy. 
PS: Glad to have you around for the last four weeks. Welcome.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:09:02
Welcome. Probably wouldn't recommend trading on Gemini. Liquidity is lower and their interface is kind of crap. Which is surprising considering the people who started it and all the hype it got from the start. I'm not sure they've improved it one bit since the beginning.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:43:32
I'm not an auditor, but I bet they would have a good idea. I don't know where it came from, but just looking at balances only matches numbers. They could have easily transferred money in or borrowed it and transferred it in before that and then pulled it back out. 
That's why companies, Banks, and anyone who handles money generally have audits. Real audits. That way you can tell where the money came from and how long it's aged and a lot more intricate details that would help clear this up. But they either refuse to do that or try to pull fake audits or lie about contracting Ledger labs.
While cryptocurrency may be revolutionary, standard business practices are not. If your bank or most of the other companies you dealt with pulled substandard business practices like this, people would be outraged. But yet, some seem to think everything is okay because they're the largest and oldest exchange, blah blah blah, it's Bitcoin, blah.
Show, don't tell. Don't accept less.
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:26:17
Except that's the exact opposite of what has happened on a larger scale. There are 3 hardware manufacturers, one of those is industrial scale only. They are all based out of the same country. Hobbyist miners have been priced out or moved out of the garage for a while. Industrial mining is where the money is at now.
Mining has never been more centralized than it is now. What you say sounds good in a vacuum and an animated bitcoin video, but is not true in current practice.

I can absolutely say that the entire market cap of tethers was not added in the last 3 months. Tether has been around for two to three years or more somehow.
And I've traded Bitcoin for many years now, you don't need to explain to me how that works.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:07:17
Your argument isn't very good, just like your anecdotal post proclaiming bitfinex didn't lead the rally so the tether problem is handled now! While I can't pinpoint the role of tethers, I can say that you're wrong because bitfinex was leading this rally at times as well until the other exchanges caught up. That's not unusual in many rallies I've seen for different exchanges to take the lead. How many rallies has bitfinex led in the past 7 months or year?
Show me a tether audit, not anecdotal posts from various price rallies. Otherwise it's all conjecture on both sides, but there's a lot of questions that bitfinex refuses to answer and they are not trivial. The silence is deafening.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:04:28
Are we talking about where they looked at the bank accounts and that's it? That is not an audit and there is no way to tell how long that money has sat there or whether that was just deposited before they looked. Not an audit. Audits are fairly standard business practices, especially businesses that engage in banking or exchanging money. Or is this sarcasm? I really can't tell anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:33:27
The above/below issue is not entirely new, Coinbase used to do that and that's where they pad their bottom line. I don't have an issue with that. The problem I have is that they don't seem to understand that cash is not the same as Bitcoin and are in a world of hurt if they think they can keep pulling this 24 hour line.
The quickest way to go out of business is to be unreliable and untrustworthy.
BTW, withdrawal JUST went through after hitting 17-18 hours. They hit me with the initial,"Get back to us by the end of the day", and I hit them with "No, cancel my withdrawal now". Then ALL of a sudden it went through. I will NEVER use them again.

@_date: 2018-02-08 09:57:59
Not sure if serious...
Novogratz has been into crypto long before many other institutional investors. He even had the balls and integrity not to launch a new fund in December because he was concerned about the market bubble.
Fun fact, a client of mine has a sister who married into the Novogratz family. I've been hearing about his thoughts behind the scenes for years now.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:18:03
I think I saw your tweet, oddly enough.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:37:16
There's not really an allure to that, although they have a fairly low spread comparatively to other instant purchase options and LBC. Maybe 1-2% at most. They also don't charge fees or a withdrawal fee, but that doesn't help if you can't withdraw.
I was really just trying it out as that is part of what I do as a consultant in this space to learn about services and issues so I can be informed and inform my clients should they ask. I get purposely paid to try to break things like this at times and then find out where things went wrong and provide a solution.
There was a big deal made about this and the Robinhood app, I'm just tempering expectations because it seems CashApp has very little understanding of how Bitcoin works at a basic level.

It is a bit confusing. However I don't believe Charlie Lee would sacrifice his reputation in crypto to spread FUD. He seems intent on his characterization and understanding of what is going on in China. If it was a joke, I think he would just use one tweet, but he has made multiple tweets doubling down on his news.
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:14:22

You mean in regards to the investments and some of the calls he made, correct? Or is that a play on hindsight 20/20? Low on sleep.
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:15:59
No, I was referencing this tweet all along.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:18:02
Originally called for a $10,000 top and retrace.
When it blew past that he called $40,000 in 2018.
Then he said it would go to $8,000 or below before rising again which he has been correct so far. I can't remember what his timeline on that was though.
That's one of the reasons he didn't want to start the hedge fund as he kept having to revise estimates.
He did call the top on Litecoin, so there's that.
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:49:34
No. The joke was the shirt. He originally tweeted that it was Bitcoin, then clarified that it was Bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:11:19
I want to clarify that I get this information secondhand and often in spurts, but it is a client/friend of mine who has been in crypto as long as I have and we have seen and been through all the shit over that time so we trust each other implicitly.
I can't necessarily disclose too much here as it would be detrimental to my relationship with my client and potentially give identifying information, if the little I gave hasn't done so already. I'm not trying to be and this won't turn into but I have to be careful.
I knew he was making a play into crypto before he announced it in 2013 and there have been some things over the years that I knew privately but he hadn't disclosed publicly yet.
Hearing what he had to say about ETH finally pushed me over the edge into buying into their OG ICO back in the day. Personally, I was skeptical as were many here. But he got that right.
This year I heard some of the inside baseball behind his decision not to start the fund in December as it was discussed around Xmas. 
There were a variety of factors, but mainly I got the sense he felt like he kept having to revise his estimates, calling a top at $10k I think, but then it blew past that. At the same time, he saw the mania happening in Litecoin and called the top better than Charlie Lee possibly. Very close. 
Just a lot of conflicting opinions that he didn't feel comfortable making that business decision at that time. He's not afraid to take risks, as his record before crypto shows as well, but he's also pragmatic. He didn't necessarily even need to do it then and felt it was better to wait and see.
Never met the guy though. So....take that for what it's worth. I know, nothing groundbreaking, but that's what I feel I can comfortably say publicly.
Hi M&amp;M if one of you are reading this! You know what those initials mean.

Hardwire it into ethernet only when you need to make transactions. You can disable the Ethernet or wifi adapter until it's needed once you login. The USB block is both for security and to make sure nobody pulls any files or wallet backups.
We used this for super cold storage so it wasn't used often and was mainly for collecting payments and not sending anything out.

I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience. I've been using them exclusively since Gox started having troubles months ago. I've never had a problem with them, but now that I say that I'm sure something is going to happen. I've been eyeing Coinbase, however.
@_date: 2013-05-18 05:43:54
It looks like they worked with a developer on bitcointalk and made some sort of agreement with him to bring it to market. I'm sure producing these wallets will be much easier than developing an ASIC and might not have even involved whatever team they have working on the ASIC's as most of the work seems to have been done already by the original developer. 
I understand the sentiment, however, but think we are also missing the impact that a good hardware wallet would make on the Bitcoin network as a whole and help provide an easy way for everyone to keep Bitcoins in a secure, cold-storage type environment from what it looks like. I don't know much about it but from what I've read and what you can see on their sign, though.
@_date: 2013-06-26 22:59:27
How about WTF? Because....WTF?
@_date: 2013-06-06 01:24:14
I meant in regards to communication. Avalon doesn't communicate at all. They don't even take emails, I don't believe. BFL communicates too much. They answer emails and phone calls, albeit slowly.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:24:39
Yeah, Dwolla pulled it like they pulled it from Mt. Gox a while before that. Essentially, while they claimed it was for regulatory reasons it is highly likely that they did it because Bitcoins directly compete with Dwolla's whole idea for the most part. They said it only accounted for some piss poor percentage of their business but I doubt it. I had never heard of Dwolla before Bitcoin and haven't since then and probably never will again.
@_date: 2013-09-19 03:41:37
I understand that, but I don't see that number on that page. I just see the number of chargebacks themselves and not a dollar figure total. A cursory check of the threads listed doesn't seem to reveal many dollar figures either. That's why I'm asking where that number is coming from.

I've come to the conclusion that there is a lot of baby raping going on in the Bitcoin community according to the hatred and vitriol I see for a variety of players.
@_date: 2013-05-18 01:10:00
This is what I was thinking and I'm pretty sure something like this could get mass produced easily somewhere other than where they are putting the ASIC's together. I actually think it's a cool idea and a really necessary component to the Bitcoin network as a whole and the adoption rate as there aren't really many hardware wallets out there right now. I know the BFL hate will deter many from realizing this though. 
**Disclaimer: I am a very early customer who runs two BFL FPGA's while waiting on my Jalepeno and a 60GH on order, I feel all of your pain, but I find the irrational hatred a bit much at times**
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:58:47
Take a step back from the ledge. At first for me, daytrading Bitcoins was more terrifying than jumping out of a plane. But after a while it kind of comes on like the Matrix and you can see patterns. I can't exactly explain it and maybe it's not for everyone, but in the end the long term strategy of buying and holding has been the winner. 
I've made mistakes too that I kick myself for sometimes, but it also helped me learn more, although that lesson was a bit expensive at times.

Nice work! I researched Ukyo and Bitfunder and knew they had connections to the US as well as other countries but couldn't remember where they were actually based. Regardless, while they may take steps to stay out of direct US regulatory control, the country they are located in could be strong-armed as another commenter said. Just look at how Liberty Reserve being based in Costa Rica didn't help them. Another factor to consider is that a lot of those securities listed ARE based in the US and so they WILL have to comply or move as well. The Shavers decision opened a can of worms on this one.

I am not a lawyer, but I have done a lot of research on this and from what I've learned it doesn't really matter where they are based if their listed securities are being traded to customers based in the US. That goes for both the securities themselves and the exchanges.
For reference, check out this original thread when the SEC came down on Shavers: 
MSantori is Marco Santori who practices law in New York is also the Bitcoin Foundation’s regulatory affairs committee chairman.
From that thread:
"Quote from: Peter Lambert on July 23, 2013, 05:09:07 PM
What do you think about the chances they will charge everything on BTCT as illigal investment offerings?
I think they are pretty good, actually.  From the attendant Investor Alert:
"the fraud may also involve an unregistered offering or trading platform"
and, here's the real kicker:
"Any investment in securities in the United states remains subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC regardless of whether the investment is made in U.S. dollars or a virtual currency. In particular, individuals selling investments are typically subject to federal or state licensing requirements."
I have, of course, counseled my clients on this point for some time.
Attention Unregistered Exchanges, Perpetual Mining Bonds (PMBs), REITs, and other members of the Bitcoin investment space: The SEC has explicitly indicated its intention to apply the already-existing laws to your security.  You may be selling securities in violation of the Securities Laws."
@_date: 2013-06-05 22:06:22
This is actually not true, although that's easy to get confused because of BFL Josh/Inaba's duality. This was to make good on their original promise when they announced that they would get 1watt/GH and that if they didn't hit it they would donate the 1000 BTC to charity.
@_date: 2013-06-05 15:59:25
What's the difference? I know Sean's Outpost takes Bitcoins, but not many large charities do that. I think the idea is to help facilitate the growth of Bitcoin and this does exactly that.
How did the EFF, CGMiner, Coinpunk, Bitcoin Foundation, Bitcoin JS, and Armory do any favors for BFL? BFG/Luke Jr is a bit debatable, but it still helps development.

I understand what you are talking about. I've worked for a charity before, actually. My point is that this is pretty much a website that has 1000BTC that you can track where the donations went. I'd imagine that's quite low overhead because they just need somebody to build it and update it, but it doesn't come out of those initial funds because that money can be easily tracked. 
Looks like they did donate 75 BTC to Sean's Outpost and already knew about them but it just hadn't been added yet according to the Sean's Outpost reddit account.

This article is a piece of crap. Really disappointing by Wired to get a review machine and then not even review it. Everybody knows about BFL's troubles, but they act like this is the first time they've heard of this. BFL may have an integrity problem, but Bob Sackocrap has a journalistic integrity problem.

Yeah, this is a really bad "review" or "article" or whatever it was. Not researched well, no review of the product. I'm not sure what the point was of this except to bash BFL but none of that is news either. I would have expected better from Wired.

Liquidity is the reason for the variance of price. Some exchanges are easier to get fiat in and out of, like Bitstamp, some aren't, like Gox and Gox Bucks, and some are pseudo-exchanges like Coinbase. Volume also plays a role as well.

And it's not just an issue of time, but that does factor into it. Many of my clients have already established successful businesses and this is a side project for them. They know it has value and like the concept and have an entrepreneurial spirit, but they don't quite have the experience or understanding that it takes  from someone who has been around it a while to realize their vision or have a feel on the market as a whole. That's where I come in. It's not especially glamorous, mostly sitting in front of your computer all day watching the market price and researching the market/competition. But I'd rather be doing this than anything else right now and the potential payoff is much higher than any other opportunities I might have from my college education at the moment as well.

That would mean that the EFF, CGMiner and BFGMiner were all in on this. You do understand how the Blockchain and wallets and transactions work, right?

I'm not so sure the response bothers me as much as that it took a FUD thread on Bitcointalk to get him to give an update or respond to his customers. As someone who works in the communications industry, I find the difference in communication styles between Avalon and BFL to be quite interesting. However, I wish there was another company that found a happy medium between the two.
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:02:48
You call that article "gloating"?
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:54:27
I don't think it started there, but it still didn't help. Bitstamp is notoriously bearish though and wasn't really retracing to it's 24hr levels like Gox and BTChina did earlier today. 
I saw him moving that wall further and further down and then taking out the fairly large buy wall that was there. He could have made much more if he split that into separate groups but he started a panic. Glad he's out of the market at least.

That is pretty awesome. Where can I find something like that and how much does it cost?
@_date: 2013-05-17 04:35:40
Definitely my exchange of choice. I moved there after Gox screwed up a couple withdrawals and haven't looked back. They have a much smaller volume of trades but I expect that to increase now.

I've spoken with Cyrus and Lee at Ars before. Cyrus was always negative towards Bitcoin, but Lee is interested in the crypto/tech side of it. I'm not sure anything will change Cyrus' mind.

I saw that! I came back for good now earlier when Bitminter went down. After looking around, I much prefer EMC.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:24:50
Definitely. I began by doing my trades on my own Excel spreadsheet and then seeing how they held up. Bitcoin is, of course, an incredibly hard to predict market but there are indicators there if you look hard enough. I won't say I'm an expert by any means and it still makes me edgy, but I've won more than I've lost and I like the adrenaline flow and rational decision making scenarios that eventually happen.

Yeah, Dwolla taking away support was a huge blow. Hoping they can figure it out at CampBX, but they aren't the most expedient unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:19:39
I don't, but I've been thinking about getting a Kill A Watt for a variety of reasons. Might have to purchase one once I accumulate a few Bitcoins.

You are correct. I didn't word that correctly apparently in that I meant to show the ability of the US to strong arm other countries, rather than to equate the similarities of BitFunder and Liberty Reserve.

I'm right there with you in the June orders.
@_date: 2013-08-21 01:59:52
Thanks! That's what I thought. I now think he's talking about how he's stuck at the price he bought them for and can't sell if they go down or up to lock in profit during that time period.
@_date: 2013-05-18 06:04:04
Nice. I left for BX after Gox too and haven't looked back. I like the interface better and it just seems smoother for me. Definitely wish Dwolla was faster but what can you do when banks are involved.

The issue is that they are trying to "protect" US citizens, but we've seen just how well that works with the SEC. While they don't need direct authority, per se, they just need to present their case and what they want the outcome to be to the country where the site/securities reside in and then let them handle it while sitting on the bench. 
Now, I'm not saying there's going to be a witch-hunt on securities and trading platforms just yet, but I do know they have very good reasons to be worried and in CYA mode. BTC-TC just didn't realize it until now but you can see the seeds being planted in that original SEC Bitcointalk thread. The SEC/US government may turn a blind eye for a bit, but they will start paying attention when there are substantial losses or shady practices that affect US citizens like Shavers ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2013-06-04 03:48:28
Yeah...thankfully I considered it more of an experiment or something to play around with and I had some extra money at the time. I believed in Bitcoin, I just didn't know it would get this big so far, I guess. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:13:08
Oh yeah, I got that part it just seems strange that the magic number seems to be exactly 60 BTC for all involved from what I've seen so far.
Regardless, if you did what you said at age 15 then I congratulate you. I may not have had that discipline when I was that age.
@_date: 2013-06-04 02:55:26
You don't have to remind me that, I know. Then again at the time nobody else had anything like this on the market so I made a bet that I could afford to lose. I knew this wasn't going to be like buying any other sort of computer/electronic device or an investment, because Bitcoin as a whole was at the time, and still is, brand new territory for everyone.
@_date: 2013-06-06 16:38:59
Thanks for the update. I am interested in doing this with my Jalapeños and was wondering how hard it was to set up. Going to have to give it a try, for science.

Find your deposit address at your account on Btc-E and send them there. Double check the address to make sure. An offline wallet only means that it isn't connected to the internet, either on a computer with Armory, a paper wallet, etc. An online wallet is like Blockchain.info mostly.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:42:08
Ahh, I see. Thanks for the quick response!
@_date: 2013-06-07 17:23:21
Somewhat, but I don't really count 300MH USB sticks and 10GH erupter blades as consumer devices on the level of Avalon or BFL. Also, that isn't their core business model either. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:03:45
It sounds like you answered your own question. I used to use CampBX until Dwolla went away. They have delayed ACH already so they might again. Who knows?
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:50:34
You can, but the reason for the price difference is mainly liquidity. Its hard to get fiat in/out of CampBX and the volume of coins is much lower so the prices are lower. On the opposite side, it's nearly impossible for many at this time to get fiat out of Gox so they are essentially Gox bucks.

It's just a box of little boxes!!!

I haven't had a problem selling on BX and withdrawing to Dwolla and then sending it to my bank. It's been seamless so far.
@_date: 2013-06-07 17:25:09
The only certainty in Bitcoin is that everything is uncertain. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:10:01
I was able to buy instantly yesterday but today I am not able to either. I'm really not liking that Dwolla took support away from CampBX right about now. It was the only real US exchange, but it did have its issues at times. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 05:10:10
It usually does it instantly for me, but I've had an account with both for a while. I just did one a couple hours ago and it showed right up. You probably need to contact them.

I have a question that I'm not quite sure about. While ASIC's at their present state are relatively affordable to consumers, is that going to change the next generation? Right now, if they ever deliver, the BFL MiniRig ran for $30,000 for 1,500 GH. Am I correct to assume as time goes on that more powerful and costly equipment will be necessary to mine, therefore eventually centralizing the mining network from the decentralized general consumer to those miners/companies with the cash to afford that? Is that an issue or am I wrong in that assumption?
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:04:46
So did Cryptsy just hit the free Bitcoin switch today or are people finding a new way to beg for free Bitcoin from Redditors? I want to believe, but this could go both ways.

It can take a few days sometimes in my experience. I even had the direct line for Tony and Stephen. They just have a relatively small staff for their operation.

You mean the same hardcore Bitcoin advocates who don't seem to understand how the Blockchain and the transparency of transactions work?
@_date: 2013-06-05 21:47:54
Maybe they should have just followed the Avalon business model. I find it interesting the duality of the way the two different businesses communicate with their customers/the public.
@_date: 2013-06-04 03:29:08
What kind of cyclical logic is that? You're asking people to fund you while you find something, maybe, and then publish those findings, maybe. How are you any better or more credible than BFL? Why do your "military connections" matter? Are you going to invade the bushes of their offices with veterans and dig through their trash?
@_date: 2013-06-17 22:46:57
Because...Paypal.  
@_date: 2013-09-19 18:27:04
It is my understanding that if you are a high risk merchant with PayPal they make you keep a certain percentage of your sales relative to your risk in your PayPal account to protect themselves and buyers. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 11:20:20
So what's their wallet address then? Because it isn't on that page and that section just says to donate to the other organizations. Therefore, unless I am completely missing their wallet or Bitpay widget, they don't take Bitcoins.

Well, you're unfortunately screwed at the moment if you hold US based securities or use an trading platform connected to the US because somebody here had to ruin it for everyone else until the legalities issues are cleared up now. Other trading platforms could fill the void and just try to restrict US users as well, similar to other services that are legal in other areas of the world but not in the US.

Lulz, just like they protected everyone from the subprime mortgage derivatives in 2008 and the S&amp;L crisis of the late 80's early 90's. They don't want to protect anyone, they want a piece of the pie.

Did you have instant with a backup credit card by any chance? Then it will just charge to the card, supposedly.
@_date: 2013-06-05 15:09:14
Did anyone actually look at the site? It shows where the money is going to and shows you the transactions on the Blockchain. It is transparent and obvious what happens to the money in the fund. They said they are even going to add more charities and allow people to provide input on where the money should go.
Only BFL could give money to charity in a very transparent manner and make good on their bet and get a knee-jerk backlash like this.

I call bullshit and you know it. First of all, Jallys didn't go up in price to $274 until April and you said you bought yours in February. Then you say you ordered that model because it was shipping faster at the time but NOTHING was shipping in February. They didn't even start shipping until the end of April. Finally, you say you got it in July but they weren't even shipping February orders in July of any miner. Care to try again?
