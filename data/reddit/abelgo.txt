I think its more about the principle for him and the way we got here. The elephant in the room is that bitcoin as it stands now is basically broken. Making the block side debate about Roger is just a deflection tactic for dealing whit the actual problem. The original size increase was put in my Gavin Anderson. We talk about bitcoin being decentralized but that's total nonsense its become a protocol thats esciencially controlled by about 5 people with commit access to the source code who have taken over the IP and created there own vision for its future

Na $100 on the price is is a big deal. This is just one more thing that is fucking bitcoin. Imaging every time you took out cash from the ATM the bank screwed you for $100

Pretty up there I would say.  Wouldn't want to fly the plane but the MSc in Comp Sci and the physics background might buy us some air time. You forgot to mention finance psychology and economics.  Dont get me wrong the crypto important but at the end of the day people are going to use it because it solves their problems or makes them rich and they don't give a fuck if its called segwit or big dildo just as long as it flys.

good luck wiht that one. because most of those alt-coin dudes would sure be happy to sell you there tokens for real cash.

NZBCX. been running for a few years now.

The guy is not Dumb he's just motivated and have some valid points. Its and important part of any open debate to have a balance of views put forward. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:04:18
That dude is just pain. He he just shuts shop when even the price start going up and wont well unless its over the moon then cuts back to only 10% above market when the price is falling.  Just use the NZ exchange.  Cant really beat it.

Vers is not the problem here. He is just being used as a distraction delaying resolution to some very real problems
@_date: 2017-01-20 04:48:39
Have you ever had do deal with the core devs. Seriously some of those guys are so far up there own arseholes its impossible to have a normal conversation with out some of that shit they start talking hitting you in the face.   
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:38:48
That I may not agree with Roger Vers on every thing but on this one meaning the block size increase, He has my full support.   
@_date: 2017-01-20 05:25:15
Pretty much the same either way from where I'm standing.  What we really need is a better governance model. BU is a bit of a fuck you solution but its the only real vote we have right now.
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:45:35
Yeah im running a couple of BTC1 nodes 
@_date: 2017-01-21 15:28:41
I'm fairly certain the Craig Write thing was after Gavin had already split from core. That was a weird one.  My impression was that he was always a bit over his head. Some people might say bitcoin just grew up.  Gone are the days when it was given away for free on a site Gavin ran or any one could spin up some graphics cards to mine.  The original people in it were not actually in it for the money.  They were mostly idealists who had witnessed the financial crash in 2008 and wanted something better. The vision was always to create a for the people p2p network and remove banks and the hands of power from the monetary system. This is not really the vision we see now.  
@_date: 2017-01-20 04:39:20
Yeah its funny.  But it an't helping...  
**Edit** saw it again this morning.. can concur, shit is still funny.
@_date: 2017-01-19 11:48:35
Grow up people. I'm with Roger on this one. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:14:33
I notice the contrast from back in the day when Gaven Anderson was basically the guardian around core. He came across a lot more approachable and was more recitative to criticism. After they split with him they seems to go on a bit of a rampage to revoke his commit access and push him out.  The concept around core that Gaven held up was that is was also only what he called a reference implementation.  It was about an open protocol that should be easy for any one to implement and improve on core has gone another direction. The team are a lot more insulated from the end users now. They are all about following the money and the miners.

Personally I like the guy Ive delt whit him before bitcoin existed and while you were watching mocked him to his face. Rich in the scheme of things that's all relative but IMHO asshole he is not.  
@_date: 2017-01-20 05:15:54
Yes and it scares the fuck out of me
@_date: 2017-01-20 04:11:38
It would be nice to think that but unfortunately its quite far from the reality your suposid lose bunch of volunteers are now well paid for by venture funds and vested interests the outcome being a bunch of infighting and bricking with an eventual power struggle over a network that is now essentially dominated by about 5 people who still have commit access to a system that we all depend on.     
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:13:26
Na its not an investment. Its just currency trading.  Like selling those Mexican pesos for USD and kicking ass. with at 20% gain thanks to Trumpy.  BTC is no real different that putting gold under the mattress and the price is about as voilitaile. Gold is not an asset either its just a hedge against inflation
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:05:36
Bitcoin is totally broken.  So being an early adopter I can now check out of life for generations to come, couple of 1000 btc and we just created the next Trump when my grand kids get hold of it and its worth billions. How is that going to make the world a better place.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:26:08
Hahahahhaha, yeah those bitcoin elites are Angles. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:22:25
I wish they would put some logic in their date formats.
Month-Day-Year  WTF.  02-05-17
Why Why ?? Oh please why ?  YYYY-MM-DD no problem,  DD-MM-YYYY easy, MM-DD-YY ???
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:23:12
I'm just not buying it.  I think is just a natural language representation.  People often say "August 1st, 1980" when they speak, but writing MM-DD-YYYY is just fucking confusing and incomparable whit the rest of the world, not naturally sortable  in any order,  I don't get what you are talking about almost every thing is sorted by day every time we want to know if something happened before something else 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:35:20
Its real seen it in person my self.

I think long term holders. know this sub is a wast of space but check it every now and then for kicks just to see what the latest PR FUD is. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 15:23:05
This one will probably go down as one of the best come back scams of the year.  Claim Hack/inside job, take funds out of your customers accounts replace funds with shit token.  Buy back shit token with same funds at lover price then sell shit token to more investors for 45m, Oh we can get more for them, no problem lets just take the ones back we gave the customers. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:13:55
Yeah I will run both
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:53:51
Crazy thing is I've lost more than 10 BTC just experimenting over the years with all the different wallet providers, lost phones, shitty software, scams, lost passwords and the lot.  Its not worth tracking that down. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:37:23
Its true 
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:37:06
Thats one wild ride. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:39:32
If ... Yeah its a split and could destroy bitcoin or create 2 different bitcoins, Its also kinda of neglecting the fact that many people need time to upgrade there systems and it likely going to be a shit show 
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:33:12
never going near UASF
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:35:17
Its basically a fuck every one we are going to fork any way and do  segwit early, While the rest of the network keeps going. Its a very bad idea IMHO
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:51:57
Seriously Peter,  Just delete your reddit account, Your becoming the  Donald Trump of Bitcoin. No body intelligent gives a fuck about this crap. Show some leadership, focus on the real issues and ignore the bullishit  move froward or just get the fuck out of the way.
