Looking at the price has no effect on it, however I really do love checking the price every day.  When I check my phone in the morning, the price is more important to me than emails or texts.  I just can't wait to see where it went after I went to bed.   No investment is as wild or exhilarating as the fluctuations in BTC.  It is even fun to watch the various prices, volumes and movements on the different exchanges based in different parts of the world.  You really get a sense that it is a one world currency controlled not by governments, but the individual investors in the different markets around the world.

Scary proof that every time a loan is made, new fiat money is created out of nothing.  This creation of fiat money instantly devalues all existing fiat money in the fiat money supply.  Bitcoin is immune.  Scarcity is an awesome thing,

This guy gets it.  A whole new frontier for freedom of the individual.  My prediction is 100k by end of year and 1 million by end of 2021.  Fiat currency is doomed.  Devaluing the currency has destroyed all once great empires.

Politicians having no control over people's money?  That scares them.

My wife makes products with artwork on them and sells them online.  I asked her to make me some coasters with the Bitcoin Logos, (Bitcoin Orange, Bitcoin Gold and one I put together called Bitcoin Bull).  When I asked her to add them to her products on amazon, she thought that I was crazy because nobody would be interested.  I assured her that there are other people like me that are addicted to Bitcoin and would be interested in these products.  If not, at least I have a nice place to set my coffee cup when I am staring at the computer.  You can find them on the Handmade section on Amazon.com.

Not sure how posting new stories is an attempt to "manipulate other users into buying or selling" in my favor.  I believe that bitcoin is in a bull market and headed to the moon.  Many others on this site express the same views.  What is your belief, "no news is good news?"
