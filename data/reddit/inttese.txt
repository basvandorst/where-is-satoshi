In *aggregate*.


This is what I've always feared. I don't even think YOU are serious about keeping full nodes within reach of home desktop users. I think that's just a pretext for Blockstream to capture more and more developer mindshare, and eventually they'll, in their usual bumbling disjointed ways, violate this "sacred" principle of theirs except under utterly contrived scenarios that are not real world applicable. As a Bitcoin investor, I'm unsatisfied with the quality of substance and level of integrity going by what has been espoused by Greg Maxwell and the r/Bitcoin mod squad.


Good question (for it applies just as well to Greg Maxwell's ideas).
I was not the producer of that video, but I take it you've gathered that by now.

I'll be the first to offer our utmost *congratulations* to Blockstream:








At [Counterparty]( we can only *imagine* what those blasted *spam transactions* would've looked like in terms of "blockchain bloat". We should be thankful that Greg Maxwell has allowed Bitcoin to avoid the unseemingly *blockchain bloat* from all those promising BTC fee-paying transactions.
Please think of Luke Jr. He might not be able to run a full node on his Gentoo Linux home desktop then. For sure, we would like to extend our token thanks to Greg Maxwell for doing the public such a wonderful service. Keeping full nodes running in the first world homes of elite Gentoo loving C++ programmers deserves our *highest praise*.
Since Blockstream will play a part in making these wonderful sidechain services available to Bitcoin users through third party multisig accounts with obvious KYC risk, we can now triumphantly say Blockstream is furthering Bitcoin's relationship with banking interests, which are excitedly paying Blockstream to help them create and attain market relevancy. While these services could just as well be done on Bitcoin mainnet, [mainnet innovations]( are known to bloat the blockchain. And we simply can't have blockchain bloat. Or Bitcoin, just isn't Bitcoin anymore.

Like I said, the tradeoff, of course, is so called *blockchain bloat*. We think this is a good tradeoff that Greg Maxwell is making.
Handing over your BTC to a banking consortium's multisig account on a sidechain with obvious KYC risk can never scale any more or in any other directions than what JP Morgan Chase investment bank agrees to, and this is actually good news for Bitcoin.
An embedded consensus system built on Bitcoin mainnet like [Counterparty]( doesn't have that same "bankster advantage", and besides it horribly bloats the blockchain. The BC developers are just caught between a rock and a hard place.

You'll have to excuse me for the delay in response; I'm being limited on this forum to one post per 10 minutes.


That sounds like a good problem to have, but again, you're right. Bitcoin is better off without all that *unseemly* blockchain bloat. It's just "spam", right? We can't *spam* mainnet or Bitcoin just isn't *Bitcoin* anymore. Let's consider the matter settled.


That's odd. This would not seem to explain Blockstream's choice of using a *blockchain* as the basis for its bank consortium-like multisig sidechains.

Pre-IPO share trading is when you buy shares of a company that is not yet public from early founders/employees. Today, if you want to buy pre-IPO shares you have to go through an opaque heavily regulated process like that of [EquityZen]( where you don't even legally "own" the shares you buy; instead EquityZen enforces your rights by proxy through the early founder who sold you his shares. The only value provided by EquityZen is vetting investor status, centralizing the market for pre-IPO shares, and legally threatening pre-IPO share holding founders to pay you your dues should an exit happen or dividend get issued. IOW it's a pretty shitty deal for investors (and a great deal for pre-IPO share holders).
But with [Counterparty]( (built on the Bitcoin blockchain) pre-IPO share trading, you'd visit a site like [BlockScan]( click on all the different pre-IPO shares you find interesting, and then buy those shares directly with BTC knowing with certainty what the terms of the shares are, how many shares there are outstanding, whether the issuance is locked, view ratings of the founders, view what the dividends past and future were/are, etc.
In sum, if startups were to issue their shares with the [Counterparty]( protocol (built on Bitcoin) at inception instead of taking the traditional route, there would be a built-in market for those pre-IPO shares that would be way better than the bullshit offered by EquityZen. The market would be transparent and global from day 1, and there would be a lot more selection for investors.
