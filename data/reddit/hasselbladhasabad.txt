People like you are so concerned with "Bitcoin" you don't even take into consideration the blockchain itself. There are real companies creating real products on the technology that has created Bitcoin...nobody is arguing that BTC could go away in an instant, but crypto is going nowhere. It's a new age of business, a new way of creating a product and whether you believe in it matters not, the blockchain is here to stay.

They won't charge me a network fee if I transfer to GDAX rather than my own personal wallet?

I think you said military wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:51:06
Omg dude no, I didn't. I'm talking about the fucking blockchain, the tech that all of this runs on. What the fuck are you even talking about right now?
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:39:52
Haha, alright tight

Did you just compare the world of blockchain, a world of unlimited potential that is creating new jobs, answers to questions we never even knew to ask and building a possiblity to change the way that all finances are used, including the federal reserve looking into ripple as a legitimate currency accepted by banks, to a stuffed toy? I get that this doesn't make sense to you yet but try not to compare apples to rockets and say one is the other.

Yes but again you're only talking about BTC as a currency. A lot of this is also investing in companies, tech, etc. I have shares of a company that builds start ups and if you own their ICO you can vote on which projects and websites they build eventually rerouting returns to coin owners. The world of blockchain is vast and only looking at BTC and saying that it will fail because it's only as useful as our speculation is not only silly it's just wrong. 
You know, there was a time when only a small amount of people had the intelligence to use the internet and "digital cameras will never catch on" and yet here we are. People will learn and adapt and those that were able to start implementing the tech first will have the most to gain. Do whatever you want in this scenario but stop spreading this corporate agenda. There are no "trickle down benefits." This literally has nothing to do with multi level marketing. With all due respect you are a misinformed individual spreading fear through misinformation.

That's fair, I didn't mean to put words in your mouth, my bad. I did switch over to talking about the blockchain because I assumed that's what you were comparing to a pyramid scheme...calling Bitcoin itself a pyramid scheme makes even less sense. How can the product be a pyramid scheme? That would be like calling LOC cleaning spray a pyramid scheme because it's a product that Amway creates. Amway is a pyramid scheme because you make money by getting people to sign up under you and buy products that you then get a cut of. Real talk can you explain your thought process on how either Bitcoin, one of the many products, or the blockchain as a whole could be this?

The reason bankers call it a pyramid scheme is because bankers have made money off of YOU for ages and now they don't have a piece of the pie. Do you remember when banks used to pay to borrow your money? We used to be the lender, we'd keep our money in their stores so they could use to invest and they would pay us a return. How about now, what's your percentage return on the money you freely give to your bank to use as they please? I bet it's not even close to the amount they charge you monthly to even have a checking account...how sweet of them, charging you to borrow your money. Goddamn, when am I gonna start getting those sweet returns on my student loans I took out...that's how this works right?
No way, banks are afraid and they should be. They've fucked over everyone and had to have zero consequences for long enough. if this is a pyramid scheme sign me up cause I'll lose every goddamn penny on a gamble with them before I pay another one to let rich dicks get richer off my hard earned pay check.

Oh wow, I've been losing money for awhile it turns out.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:32:42
I guess I'm just dumb?
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:35:34
Dang, you got some anger pent up in there huh? No, I didn't give you a down vote and also, just a heads up, the votes aren't really worth anything. I'm a fan of Bernie too but do ya'll gotta make his fans seem so uptight and weird?
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:56:35
What happens if you convert it all to Monero and essentially claim that you lost it all...Monero is completely untraceable for the most part correct?
