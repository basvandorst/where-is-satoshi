If you watch the video, you would see that my opinions most likely match with yours. However, I can understand your distaste with the title.

It was over $9,500 for a bit. A correction is inevitable but hopefully it's subtle.

I agree, but many people are going to be negatively effected by their increased interest. Taxes are something that can not be avoided though.

I agree, it would be a good thing for the market

Try to earn instead of buy, especially as a young person without much capital.

I agree, although by Bitcoins nature it is naturally much more of a risk than just holding money in a bank account. So I hope that Mr. Armstrong and his team over at Coinbase are realizing how much their risk factor and target is going to increase by offering to hold billionaire portfolios. On top of what they are already holding.

Would love to hear your opinions, let me know your thoughts on the subject!

Again, the title does not reflect my opinion. I can understand why the title may have upset you, but if you watch the video you will see that my opinions most likely match with yours.

Just sent you 5 BTC, hope that helps! This is my best investment yet

I won't fight that, but if you watch the video, you will see the points that I make and that my opinions most likely line up with yours. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:14:27
Don't blink, you might miss it

Very risky, but could pay off very nicely. However, most investors would say to simply invest money that you can afford to lose. Not money that is loaned to you.

I can understand why he would want to create that service. It is a service that will have high demand, like it or not. All that institutional money isn't going to download Bitcoin Core and have an airgapped machine to store private keys (as they should) so they will resort to a counterparty. 
If Coinbase is ready to deliver this level of security ready to be such a counterparty of risk (we are talking about billionaire portfolios) it's another story. Armstrong may be punching out of his league here.

I'm sure a lot of whales will be dumping at 10-11k. For a lot of people that will be their selling point.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:02:51
That's also a good point.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:52:23

Such is YouTube. I understand your distaste though, and I appreciate the criticism none-the-less.
