This is one of the greatest things I've ever.

So are you saying people are purposely inflating the number of blockchain wallets? What would be a better way to measure the number of bitcoin users then?
@_date: 2014-10-05 01:05:45
If I'm understanding your question correctly, I don't believe this would be a problem in the long-term. (In the short-term, yes it's theoretical miners with large positions may be able to influence the market, but the forces of economics still apply).
To date, more than half the total amount of Bitcoins theoretically possible have been mined (14 million out of 21 million), and it is becoming increasingly more difficult / more expensive to mine further. Why would bitcoin miners continue to mine BTCs in your scenario and incur expenses, if the price didn't justify it? 
And how do you know how much leverage bitcoin miners hold over the market? How much of the entire market is held by these large miners? My research shows that the largest single holder of bitcoins is ~148k bitcoins, or roughly a little less than 1% of the entire market.

Where did I state this was "fundamentals analysis?" Both of the other "quotes" you have quoted are nowhere in my write up. You are inferring those on your own.
The following are actual quotes from my write up which you have seemed to have completely ignored:






Total valuation of BTC = (# of BTC available) x (current price/BTC)    
Total valuation of BTC = ~13million x $330 = ~$4billion    
$4 billion of perceived value is probably high for as small as the BTC network currently is. But, this number is reflective of the high growth rate in the number of users/owners and merchants that have accepted BTC. In other words, this may be a fair price. And, by definition, it is technically the actual fair price since it is, after all, an actual currency.
Even if there were "tangible, quantitative numbers" (your words) like P/L, cash flows, balance sheets, etc. they wouldn't apply to a *currency* like BTC as they would to an equity like a public stock. What would these "tangible, quantitative numbers" look like?
Read my background, I'm fully aware of what "fundamental analysis" is.

So, your concern is related to the *supply* of BTC. My analysis is on the *demand*, and while they are two sides of the same coin, I would argue that even if supply production were to completely halt today and supply were fixed at something like 10 million BTC (I'm just using that number), there would still be 10,000,000 satoshi/BTC * 10,000,000 BTC = some very large amount of BTCs in circulation. There would still be enough in circulation to conduct transactions.
As demand goes up, however, the price/BTC would rise and incentivize miners to get back into the game, and create more supply, because creating one more BTC would become worth it at some price point.

User base and transaction network have greatly increased since then though, how would you factor that in?
@_date: 2014-10-05 01:07:56
Haha, thanks! I loves me some good California Cab too.

What would they be attempting to accomplish by shutting off the hashrate or "taking control" as you put it? 
Would it be accurate to paraphrase your concern like this:
Market Cornering: There is the possibility a large percentage of the total available BTC are owned by a handful of individuals. For example, it is estimated that [Satoshi]( alone owns ~1 million BTC. In the event that one or more of these owners were to attempt to [corner]( there could be extreme price volatility.
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:30:07
There is definitely some speculation priced in, but what I was saying was that the number of BTC users have [increased exponentially]( since then. Perhaps many of them are buying for speculative/investment reasons, but even so, that is a significantly larger user base which a simple Price*Velocity model wouldn't address.
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:06:07
Agreed it's a long, bumpy road. And BTC may not make it, but the mechanism is viable and valuable, so if it's not BTC it will be another version of a crypto-currency. The question is, how many people will end up using it?
@_date: 2014-10-05 09:22:16


Can you expand on this? Are you saying once a transaction is written to a block and broadcasted, it is possible for a miner to reverse that transaction without the consent or knowledge of the buyer? If this is what you're saying, you need to provide evidence this is possible.


See the question I posed in the post above yours. What would the miners be hoping to accomplish by doing these things? Why would they act in such a way to destroy the value of the BTCs they hold, thus nullifying the value of the BTCs they are mining? 
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:40:41
Ah, I see what you're saying now. So, BTCs are analogous to gold then:
* Anybody theoretically can go out and mine gold.
* In reality, it's not profitable for most people, a few large mining firms dominate the industry.
* There are entities that hold large banks of gold, and could potentially ruin the market if they released it (mostly national central banks and such).
Even yet, gold is still viewed as a viable investment and store of value. Let me ask you, how is BTC any different?

Sent you a PM.
@_date: 2014-10-05 04:10:03


This isn't necessarily a bad thing. 
One of the features of having a de-centralized currency is price adjustments are handled by market supply/demand. True, it might make prices more volatile in the short-run, but I would argue it's actually better for the long-term if there are no elephants holding large positions. It's also necessary to clear the market of artificial price pressures for us to get to 21 million BTC mined.

Ok, I wasn't aware of that, and it does seem MAU might be a better metric for the online users than Blockchain wallets. Any ideas how to account for people who use apps, cold storage, or otherwise are offline? My roommate didn't trust any of the major websites to not get hacked, so he stored his offline, but he was the paranoid type.
Thanks for chipping in!

Ok, I see what you're getting at. From the same article though, 


Nonetheless, I think your original point about being concerned of a "super-miner" is probably valid, however, to me this is a technical problem that can be mitigated with a technical solution. From an economic standpoint, I just don't see a "super-miner" acting against their own interests. In the event a "super-miner" were to be doing harm to the network, the trust and value of the entire currency network would be damaged or destroyed. So again I'll ask you:
What would the miners be hoping to accomplish by doing these things? Why would they act in such a way to destroy the value of the BTCs they hold, thus nullifying the value of their own holdings and the (probably millions of) money they have invested into their mining operation?

This is a key insight, and what I was referring to with my 2nd bullet point about Worldwide Transaction Network. I think most aren't aware or don't understand this aspect about BTC. My intuition is that the secure network itself (the cryptography) could potentially be worth a lot.
