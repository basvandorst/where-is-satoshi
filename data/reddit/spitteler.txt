Think of it this way: the block chain is not just a ledger of transactions, it is a ledger of what public key owns what bitcoins.  Only the holder of the private key for a given public key can initiate a transfer of those coins to another public key. If you generate your public/private key pair offline, you can still send funds to the public key and they will be stored in the ledger ( block chain ) and can only be moved later by your private key

generating a new wallet is still unencrypted until the time you encrypt it. as far as i know, there is no way to have a fully encrypted wallet from the bitcoin-qt client.
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:40:36
Also, I find the warning that your old wallet.dat backups will become unusable when you encrypt a wallet to be boldly misleading.  Any unencrypted wallet backup before encryption can still be loaded into bitcoin-qt and the funds spent.

the Bitcoin community inside second life is quite small, does it really justify $1,000 USD setup cost and $295 USD a month to keep it running?  There is already a Bitcoin group founded by Noodles that is probably the most active Bitcoin group in second life.  Most people trading on VirWox don't even have SL accounts and just use the market as a PayPal pass through.

from what i have read, FPGA mining is not as cost efficient as GPU mining as far as equipment cost is concerned. However the advantages are a lower power consumption per hash. At this time it is only profitable to be FPGA mining if you have access to a large quantity of FPGA chips that have already been purchased for another task and are currently sitting idle.

Bitcoin QT wallet only ore generates 100 address to start, and creates more as needed. That is why it is very important to backup often.  You can check block chain to see the change address for that last transaction, but that is not helpful if the address/private key are not in the backup file.
