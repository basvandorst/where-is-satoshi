It's happening! USDT/AIR = 1.00

Congrats! You are not dumb :\) !

If you say that then you clearly haven't understood the point. Bitcoin are the drinks :\)

Agree. Central Banks and the whole bonds / quantitative easing \+ fractional reserves system are the same kind of scam, even worse since inflation figures are completely manipulated. But if you are so butthurt why don't you do something about it? :D \(not talking about BTC\)

OK I agree, but then you don't want to be holding either BTC or USDT if USDT's value is finally found to be zero. Also as you are stating, there are huge counter\-party risks in holding crypto in exchanges that hold USDT themselves. Why? Well if USDT is worth zero, then BTC/USDT is worth millions but BTC/USD \(fiat\) will drop dramatically since people would obviously cash out of BTC to fiat. Then of course USDT/USD would drop to zero too :\).

Exactly, I have nothing against cryptos, I actually love the idea that they may be the solution to the whole central bank system scam \(which is the biggest scam in history in my opinion\). Then of course I think BTC and others have a certain intrinsic value, that's why I hate the fact that these kind of companies are taking advantage of the situation. The truth is that these and others \(e.g. some ICOs\) have seen the opportunity of making money by selling paper tokens and it seems like very little is being made to stop them :\(
