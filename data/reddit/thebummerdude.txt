This is a two part problem.  Usability (as a user how simple is it to accomplish a payment) and technicality (exchange rates). The usability just isn't there. Regardless of what app you have, this ecosystem is too new to get it down the first time. You have all these steve job designers fly-boys who follow 'the customer doesn't know what they want. I do.' mentality that they actively/knowingly make it 'difficult' for users to just make a payment because they don't know any better. They have zero experience in the the payment space (except being users themselves [do they even know what they want?])  and are given the assignment to make/design a payment app.  WTF do you think is going to happen? Usability = toilet.
On the other side, even if you get the 'usability' down (how much time did you spend? less than 5 min? you're a super user. Everyone else is retarded, right? your product is a win) the technicality of how the transaction is processed is not straight forward. Look at the comments and how many calculations are being presented. I swipe my debit card and I'm done. 2-5%? If it prevents me from making mental calculations and whipping out my calculator, then fine. I'm done. Super convenient. I have a life.
Get your fucking shit together. I want to make a fucking payment. I want to pay someone. Do you get it? I don't want fancy blinking pretty colors and designs. Can you first make it functional? Tell your fucking designers to STFU. Its embarrassing to try to promote bitcoins and this is all I got. Functional first. Design Second.
