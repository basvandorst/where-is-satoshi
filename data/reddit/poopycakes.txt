nice thats awesome. Maybe I should increase the starting money a bit
@_date: 2014-12-21 13:21:05
Haha already have one, they are paying for me to get my masters which is what I coded this for. It was a real time software analysis and design class. I got am A on it. I decided to clean it up and make if secure and post it online. Registering takes 2 seconds just username password nothing else.

Just wanted to let you know I've added rankings. Should be able to see them now. 
thanks for the idea!
@_date: 2014-12-20 17:31:55
Based on your suggestion I will repost this with a different title. thank you
@_date: 2014-09-23 18:59:17
this is why I went with cold storage, even if I felt the impulse to sell it's too much of a hassle to do it.
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:33:07
I bought my coins at their all time high price, fuck me.
@_date: 2014-12-20 23:32:38
Thanks! Thank you for taking the time to look at it
@_date: 2014-12-20 17:28:38
Hey titan. It's more of a trading simulation. Buy and sell, see how much money you can make timing the market etc. Sorry for the confusion. Here are some screenshots
@_date: 2014-05-26 02:56:18
I don't think I'll be out of the red for a very long time. I hopped on the bitcoin train the day before all of the negative china news happened. I've literally never seen bitcoins worth what I paid for them. I just continue to hold on tight and believe that one day I too will be out of the red. If I had just waited I could have had 10 btc for the price I paid for 5. hindsight
@_date: 2014-12-20 22:58:39
Could you explain the first thing a little more? Not quite sure I understand. And yea I definitely agree about the last 2 points Ill add those in tonight. Thank you for checking it out!
@_date: 2014-12-15 00:33:58
no I used  and downloaded the site, ran it offline

Edit: for those interested I coded this using nodejs,angularjs , and couchdb
Edit: I hope some people start buying and selling. Since I added the leaderboard someone named vagina is number 1. ...

@_date: 2014-12-21 01:12:04
Ah I get it now. Nice suggestion I never thought of that! I'll work on that thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-15 01:21:25
thank you!

It's going to go into the negatives.

Am I at risk of this attack if I have a paper wallet? I don't feel like getting it out to check it right now. Is this only for online wallets?
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:25:49
Yea I don't. I panic bought, I lost money but I feel like a learned a pretty valuable lesson at a young age. I've got the lesson and the bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:55:28
This exchange is legal though right? Doesn't that give it more credibility for people who are scared of the whole mt gox thing? It helps people get btc right?

How Ron swanson would react if you told him his money would be stored with a computer on the internet.
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:34:38
that was the fastest reply I've ever gotten on any thread I've posted.
edit: don't understand the downvotes, i had a reply right when I clicked submit i couldn't believe it
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:27:59
thanks hahaha, strangely enough when I made this I wanted to be poopface, but that was taken...
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:41:28
But how did the employer get it?
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:39:51
do you own bitcoin? you don't seem to thrilled about it. Just curious
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:17:25
1000 here. I've literally never seen bitcoin be at or above what I purchased it for since the day I bought it. The day after I bought in was the first day of China banning bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:52:22
I'm not talking about being excited about the price, I'm excited that bitcoin has an opportunity to be more mainstream, thats what this sub is about right? We want everyone to use bitcoin, having legal exchanges pop up where people don't have to worry about the site being hacked is good news. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:22:24
wow thank you so much. I've never received one of these before!
@_date: 2015-07-11 14:51:17
This is satire right? Am I in buttcoin right now
@_date: 2015-11-06 01:54:23
Stop. We've had cheap coins for like a year. If it crashes every time it goes up its never going to be worth shit
@_date: 2015-03-17 11:53:53
In my post I said I know I can calculate it this way but the data returned from the api doesn't include the height
@_date: 2015-03-14 15:21:22
So if a new business wanted to get started interacting with bitcoin, theres no real low level guide for having a secure bitcoin setup? Btw thanks so much for taking the time to write all of this out, based on what you and the other commenter have posted I feel like I've been able to understand this a lot better.
@_date: 2015-03-17 04:26:37
What do you mean do it manually? 
@_date: 2015-03-30 03:28:39
ugh, this thread is 's wet dream
@_date: 2015-03-20 15:46:20
tattoo it inside your ass cheek
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:26:42
I don't even know what some of that is
@_date: 2015-03-02 02:29:27
you're not allowed to take it off
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:59:52
Hmm. Strangely when using bitcore to call this api none of that data is returned. I guess I'll just have to make the call myself. Thanks!!!!
@_date: 2015-03-14 13:21:24
Ok that makes sense, but how can you automate the offline signing securely? Or does it always have to be done manually? Also, for the hot wallet, I'm assuming the hot wallet is connected to the internet and therefore the private key must be available on the server somewhere to sign transactions with right? So how do they safely store this?
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:17:17
Why that year?
@_date: 2015-03-17 11:56:11
Right, but what I said in my question was I can't get the height from the api. Do you know how to do it with bitcore and node?
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:53:47
I like them! I would like to see a coin with the other proposed bitcoin symbol, the one with a B and a little dash on the bottom.   
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:09:01
Just fyi your bitcoin address is not appearing on the donation page, might want to get that resolved ;)
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:49:31
me too
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:08:00
This sounds really bad. Is this really bad or am I being dramatic?
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:01:15
right there with you pal, still waiting to see my bitcoins be worth what I paid for them again. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:56:20
mtgox was running the same transactions over and over again making the graph look like a heart monitor. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:46:38
Wouldn't that only be an issue if a query string parameter of some kind was reflected in the body of the html? I'd be more afraid of someone intercepting the request and replacing the address somehow. Why is it necessary to even show the receiving address, couldn't this be tucked away in a secure configuration file and accessed server side? 
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:49:18
Could you explain this for me? I always hear people talk about encrypting their paper wallet but what is the process for that? And what is the process for checking the balance etc after you've encrypted it?
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:58:04
How does this work? If I bought a coin and sent my coins to it, how would I get them back? And how could I be sure you wouldn't steal them knowing my key?
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:46:30

It can't be used as a currency but it can be traded as a commodity, right? I might be confused. I think this is still good news since it is legally recognized as something, I think that means they understand it. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:01:25
I bought my bitcoins using coinbase. It will take a few days before I get them. My plan was just to export all of my coins as a paper wallet and keep them off of my computer completely. Do you think this is a bad idea?
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:07:09
Wow so currency
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:03:39
No I think he means he's being robbed of bitcoins by a guy with a gun made from a 3d printer. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:04:31
Prices were heading up before the chinese got up
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:48:49
Leave it to me to buy bitcoins 5 hours before china decides to ban it. Ok fine the price is dropping big deal, I'll just buy more right? No, I bought my coins at coinbase, I have to wait 4 business days before I can buy or sell more. where does that leave me? Tuesday. I can't do shit until Tuesday. It's like I'm just sitting here with my dick in my hand but I can't get it up.
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:37:27
I'm sure he will once he gets her back, be patient
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:30:20
That's what I want to know. Not only do I want to ditch my iphone and switch to android, I want to pay for it with bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:27:41
with how bad this news is I'm surprised the price isn't down at like 500 right now
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:31:58
I just wish I wasn't being slowly fucked by coinbase right now so I could buy more. I bought my coins back on monday and they took money out of my bank right away but my coins still arent even in my wallet yet so I cant buy anymore or sell anymore. Lesson learned, use an exchange site instead. Until monday/tuesday I can't do anything though. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:52:36
My problem is that I took a lump sum that I was ok losing (my Christmas bonus) and spent it all on about 5 bitcoins when they were about 1100 each. Convinced my fiancé this was a one time buy and I wouldn't spend anymore money and she saw it as a good investment as well, but if I risked anymore money on it I'm sure it would cause her concern regardless of the value of that investment. Keeping her on board with what I'm doing is worth more to me than some more bitcoins at a discounted price. All in all I'm in it for the long run so I'm holding on until the price stabilizes and then I'm going to spend them as regular currency. I'd rather wait to spend them when they're worth at least what I paid for them. Literally the day after I bought it crashed and I haven't seen it as high since.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:50:02
Don't do that man seriously. Only invest in this crazy shit with money you can afford to lose. I've already invested a little more than I should have and I'm  a little nauseous but I think I'll get over it. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:33:26
I love it. I have a raspberry pi and I've been looking for something new to do with it.. if only I had known about it before I made my christmas list this year
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:45:37
This is why I'm upset.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:57:40
I like this idea, could you run me
Through an example
Scenario of how you would like it to work?
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:13:57
I can't get over how far they went with this joke. It really cracks me up
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:48:17
Oh I see, I think I misunderstood. For some reason I thought in order to use this printer you needed a raspberry pi, I didn't realize this was made with a raspberry pi. even though I already own a Pi, I think I'd much rather buy yours since it's nice and compact and looks good. My next paycheck I plan on buying some bitcoin just for the sake of spending, and I will buy one of your printers with bitcoin. Thanks for offering to share that with me though, you did a really nice job and I'd rather pay you for it than do it myself.

I need to learn how to play sc2, and then I need to win this

@_date: 2013-12-07 16:55:03
nice I like it, I think mtgox has an api I could use to get data from. I think this is doable, I might go this route. Thanks for the idea! I'll credit you for it if I choose to do this. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:31:33
Your comment made me feel like I should buy just 1 more...I think I just might. Fire proof safe sounds good, what about a safety deposit box in a bank? I'm guessing it would be better to hoard it myself somewhere
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:00:08
Even the most conservative of my colleagues seemed intrigued and wanted more info. We'll see what happens.
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:10:09
I would love to have all of my btc in coin form. I hate that they are collectors items now and cost so much
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:10:11
On their site they say before you print out the paper wallet. 
"A paper wallet is not a backup
Any bitcoins sent to your paper wallet will no longer exist in your Coinbase account — they will only exist in the wallet. Consider this an export."
Maybe I should do it the way you said to just to be safer? I'm not really sure.
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:52:36
thanks for sharing this, going to give my dad some bitcoin this year. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:06:26
I fucked it up too. I have terrible luck with investments, always have even since I was a kid playing runescape buying party hats. I bought bitcoin, 5 hours later china banned bit coin and it's been a shit show ever since. You can all blame me, I'm very sorry.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:33:41
BUY BUY BUY.....general tso's chicken!!
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:08:42
I don't mind storing them on the site I used for now, but I think long-term I would like to keep them offline. It seems coinbase has their own "export to paper wallet" functionality I would like to use once I receive the coins. Thanks for posting that info!
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:45:47
I'm very cheap and I never spend money on myself ever. I've been wanting a new pc for years but I chicken out every time because it's like 700 dollars. Last week I did research on bitcoin and felt really intrigued by the whole thing. I went home bought 5 coins at 1100 a piece I didnt even think twice, told my fiancé about it and she thinks it's a great idea. I don't regret it and I haven't looked back. Usually I get nauseous when I spend more than 100 bucks on anything.

I'm not really too thrilled about this glitch even though it saved the crash. I'm worried people will think there is manipulation and it will deter investors or something. I hope I'm just being paranoid
