But they are putting mining power towards classic, so that tells you how not on the fence they are...

I would just buy on Coinbase, circle may get out of the bitcoin space at some point.

I'm guessing the only logical reason they would do this is to prevent fraudulent users and to comply with US regulations.  Like if someone from Iran used tor and tried to setup an account with Coinbase using fake information that claims their in the US.

bought 25btc at 650 right at the recent 3month peak.

just so you know, sitewide updates may take a while to be made.  Their devs might have not pushed it for reasons unknown but that is not necessarily a bad thing...

or they can wait and bid again in a few months.  90k more btc auctioning soon

are you en-route to the moon?

Use Coinbase.com they insure their bitcoins and force you to take some security measures.

And OP didn't even wait to see if/how they would address the mistake.  Pretty extreme to me.  Maybe he is doing Coinbase a favor.

so much buttcoining in the general public..., I think we need some good positive PR campaigns.  Most people think it's a ponzi scheme, and that's really unfortunate. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 12:46:28
I think the only thing holding us back now is the core developers stranglehold on the blocksize.
@_date: 2015-01-20 15:56:59
makes you wonder what they are planning on doing/releasing in the coming years if they are getting this kind of attention :)
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:23:51
Ponzi scheme?  Can you explain?  I'm actually interested to hear if you have any intellectual thought behind this comment.
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:22:26
Nope, just sharing my new years resolution.  I'm not asking or suggesting anyone else do anything.  Happy New Year!

I understand, it's not for everyone, just a promise I made to myself this morning. Heck if it goes to $1,000 or more I'll spend some of it for sure though :)
@_date: 2015-01-01 16:43:23
Yes, I'll spend it instead of selling it.  It's me showing my confidence in BTC as a currency
@_date: 2016-03-13 22:36:05




Awesome thanks for the great response!  This instills my confidance in btc.

There's nothing quiet about Microsoft dropping support for bitcoin.  This is a huge loss, anyone that says otherwise doesn't see what is happening.
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:23:30
This isn't entirely accurate.  You can have the best of both worlds with Coinbase Multi-sig vaults.  You have complete control over those funds.
@_date: 2015-02-08 05:24:42
Nice to know Coinbase has employees that get it
