I trie selling at $9500 last night but I didn’t get my order in on time ����‍♀️����
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:19:42
He only got 10 months and a $2000 fine?!!!
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:03:27
Hah! Starting off the morning right.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:01:51
Life happens. Just know that your time will come too. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:10:49
Ahh makes me feel so much better!
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:49:00
It will, just stay positive. Vent..? Well in that case, I was staring at the dips and didn’t recognize them. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:28:11
Schmucks unite ��
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:21:50
Move it to a hardware wallet stat! Trezor and Ledger are both very popular. I personally use the later.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:16:03
Let’s hope so!
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:51:53
Oh so very true. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:00:38
Umm, why do I love this video so much?
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:22:15
We need more propaganda so the price drops and I can buy more! Muhahah
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:42:01
What makes you think that?
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:22:44
There aren't any fees to move your funds between GDAX and Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:05:49
lol. Now that's all I see.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:08:25
Really? I was able to. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:28:37
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:06:54
how I miss a dip when I’m staring right at it ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:15:34
I wish. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:18:07
I’ve spent $40 in wire transfer fees and it got declined because they’re having issues. Seriously sucks. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:52
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:30:38
BTC is back up to $6800. When do you predict it will lower?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:54:28


@_date: 2017-11-28 16:09:18
Bcash 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:31:55
What’s the expected duration with the last being eleven days? Does that diminish in length wise over the years as well?
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:17:02
I’m a newbie in the sense that I am now proactively seeking knowledge. Previously I was investing a small amount monthly so I guess that’s why mine is higher...?
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:11:21
First and foremost I’m a student. I am always looking to learn from others whether it’s positive feedback or negative, specific feedback. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:15:21
Quick q, I always move crypto to a hardware wallet but what happens to the cash I have in the exchange if they were to be hacked, etc.?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:59:38
When is it projecting to lower?
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:18:34
That's amazing!!
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:12:45
Still less than the amount I want to buy ��. I emailed Coinbase but they haven’t responded yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:39:24
Imagine being able to afford 300 btc now?...WOW
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:09:37
FYI, alerts don't always work. There's plenty of times where Coinbase didn't notify me OR the worst is when it notifies me but it's delayed so I missed the price range I was looking to buy in. I find using GDAX and setting a limit order has given me my sanity back. Set it and forget it...until you change the price your willing to pay.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:37:26
Oh boy. You’re feeding my temptation now ��
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:15:05
Thank you for the link! I guess the short answer is just buy, NOW.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:36:25
Thanks for sharing that piece of nugget. Is there a website that posts upcoming hard forks? I was only aware of B2X. It's $7,300+...impatiently waiting for a dip.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:44:42
Use Gdax! It's owned by Coinbase but it doesn't have a friendly interface that's all. You can look on youtube how to use Gdax without fees.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:21:31
Touché my friend, touché. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:33:57
But the hard fork is not a bad thing if we sell B2X and buy bitcoin. Right??
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:26:04
Why do think so?
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:18:14
My limit is $7500/wk ��
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:33:01
Truth. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:25:42
Thank you so much for you response. I only moved $5 BTC to my hardware wallet to test that it works but I left the remainder in Coinbase because I figured trying to collect after the fork would be complicated. So thank u for confirming that!
Do you suggest buying BTC as soon as B2X is granted? I’m wondering whether the value of B2X matters...as in is it a risk to hold a few hours for example. 
Lastly, what makes this fork different for the past ones? Like BTC cash. I had all my BTC Coinbase but I don’t see where I was given free BTC cash...am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:40:56
Only? That’s a huge amount to me!
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:39:36
I was thinking from about $2k to be honest. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:01:44
Hey, I had the tatas to sell my Apple stock. Don’t sell me short ����‍♀️
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:20:44
I NEED people start panicing again!! I missed $5500 =(
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:30:29
Lol. Thanks captain obvious. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:17:54
Something is better than nothing =)
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:31:57
Are u referring to the past weekend?
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:05:46
I was wondering the same thing. I'm bummed I missed the dip.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:02:33
Will this cause prices to go up or down before December?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:27
By the time I went to cancel my order for $10k GDAX stopped loading. UGHHHHH
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:03:16
Thanks! Does it link to coinbase/GDAX? Or does it require you to manually add?
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:21:15
When on the 16th would I be able to see the B2X I’m given? Will Coinbase create a separate wallet for eg btc, ethereal, lite(something)? Also should I consider the value of B2X when selling it or is it just best to sell ASAP? 
Thank you in advance!
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:57:04
Waiting for a dip is making me so nervous. Any suggestions??
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:50:03
Time is irrelevant in the sense that if it was to drop, new buyers would own a larger portion of a bitcoin than buying it at a higher price. That wouldn’t change whether we’re in it for 5 years, 10 years, or even longer. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:20:43
Thanks! Didn’t realize this sub exists. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:22:43
I’ve decided to sell $10k stock and buy BTC. It is wise to do it before or after the fork? There are so many opinions out there!
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:26:54
I'm hoping the price will go down so I can Buy!!!
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:20:24
Not at all. Join in at your own risk and enjoy the journey!
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:04:48
I'm getting nervous waiting for a Dip. Any suggestions??
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:52:15
Buy under a trusted parent and then transfer it over to your wallet. You don't have to be 18 to use BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:53:14
Tell me about it. Ugh
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:00:22
Sounds like a good plan to me. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:51:16
Hi there, what's the best strategy in buying? What are your most used resources? Would love your thoughts on the upcoming CME situation!
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:20:56
What makes you so sure? Also, whats a "reflex" drop?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:24:43
How would you make a clone of a hardware wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:34:51
$10,800 is a correction?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:15:37
You really think BCH will take over? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:51:41
I'm having the same issue in reverse. I can't get any of limit orders to fill. Grr
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:47:44
How come my orders don't fill? I set it for 0.1btc and it never fills. What am I doing wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:54:20
That makes it quite appealing. ��
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:14:26
I was referring to the subject line. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:27:31
Thanks for all the links!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:13:58
In the US as well =/ maybe it's a sign? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:43:19
Hi there, I'm trying to make sense of all this CME stuff. Is it best to buy prior or after CME? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:06:48
What’s a shift card?
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:16:58
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:17:41
Curious—mind expanding on that?
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:16:25
Thanks for your suggestion. I am definitely not holding you accountable for any of my actions. My intention with both is for long term investment. I try to tell myself it doesn’t exist so I don’t get tempted. In this case would you still suggest going all in on BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:58:37
Thank you! Still going to struggle ��
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:52:26
Holy moly! Thanks for the clarification ��
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:19:30
Totally not looking to disrupt my current lifestyle lol. Stocks and BTC are both long term plays IMO. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:17:37
No, don’t tell me that ����‍♀️. So you don’t think it’s a good idea anymore?
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:13:24
While I did use the word advice on the post, I’m more interested on the why’s behind the what’s. Why sell partial or all stocks? Or why go all in on bitcoin. How important is diversification? Those are the types of things I am interested in. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:27:48
I paid $30 in wire transfer fees to the bank plus $10 to GDAX but I felt it was worth it since the fees were similar for $200 through Coinbase and thousands through GDAX. I haven’t placed an order yet so I’m not sure if it’s instant. I believe there’s a limit to instant but I did set it up in a way where I don’t have fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:24:30
I don’t know too much about Bitcoin gold. Would you mind sharing some insight?
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:02:12
UGH, me too!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:28:40
Will it not drop to $5500 again? I missed it yesterday ����‍♀️
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:05:41
Super nervous waiting for a dip. What should I do??
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:31:43
I pray for a drop!
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:38:54
Were you looking to triple your money at the end of the year as well or were you motivated by something else?
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:12:04
I guess I’m still confused. Why do we get access to BCH in January but B2X immediately? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:26:02
When will you have access to it? BCH is in January I believe. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:24:25
I’m waiting for it to drop to $5500 again since I missed it yesterday ��
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:55:33
How low do you think it will go?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:50:12
I’ve always purchased through Coinbase but was tired of the fees so I’m trying to buy on GDAX but none of my orders fill ��
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:12:04
When do you predict the 5.5k dip?
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:29:41
Ah. So hoping someone is selling a partial amount is a no go?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:49:48
Awesome! How are you keeping track of the growth? Coinbase doesn't provide the view you attached.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:46:02
We're all in the same boat.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:53:24
None of the limit buy orders I set ever fill. Please advise.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:44:51
Mind sharing how you calculated that?
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:59:24
That’s why it’s so tricky ����‍♀️
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:14:28
What does it mean for those of us looking to purchase bitcoin or are already invested?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:06:27
Gotcha! So I went ahead and initiated my stock sale which will take 2-4 business days to settle and then I need to transfer into my banking acct. I should have everything set to buy on the 15th. I’m so nervous and excited all at once!! 
Here’s a silly question...if I buy more on the 15th, the purchase will be pending because of the way Coinbase works. Will they still give credit for that transaction in B2X? If so, will be able to sell B2X immediate to purchase BTC?
Thank you so much for your support!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:35:31
It’s always a checking. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:51:33
I'm trying to purchase on GDAX by setting a limit so I don't have to pay fees but none of my orders fill. Please advise =(
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:14:33
If you’re being serious...I’m referring to Apple Inc. If you’re trying to be an ass, I’d refrain from commenting without adding any value. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:38:30
I made a wire transfer to GDAX which is a part of Coinbase. 
Also businesses don’t use savings accounts for the purpose to receive wires it’s always checking. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:56:59
I want to buy $10,000 I just don’t know when to ��
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:52:57
Interesting. So if I was your sister, you’d advice me to buy right now?
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:31:25
NOOO!!!! =(
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:37:29
So let's say its at 7718 right now and I set it as 0.5 btc for 3859, shouldn't it fill? Because mine is not =(
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:03:01
Bless you for trying! Math makes me nervous. It always has. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:40:34
You guys are all joking, right??
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:13:44
Would that include me as well since I have all my BTC during the fork for BTCcash?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:44:28
I was lucky enough to have had a limit order I set through Gdax which triggered the purchase for me. I would HIGHLY suggest it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:38:22
Guess what?! My order for 0.01 btc for $71 was filled!
