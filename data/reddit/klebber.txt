I live in Quebec, j’aime cette nouvelle :)
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:59:13
Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:11:09
Damn I feel bad, I recommended Electrum to people... 
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:08:52
That sounds interesting, and also decentralized exchanges
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:42:00
Our dependance on centralized exchanges is the real problem here. They have too much influence over the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:39:43
Not trying to say that decentralized exchanges are ready, they need a lot more work to be usable
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:30:07
Thank you, really appreciate it :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:15:05
Okay but dude this is encouraging reckless investing we don’t need that. That is partly what caused this crash. Just invest what you can afford to lose and hodl. Don’t double-down on your investments please.

Have incentives in place for exchanges to implement segwit. Right now they don’t care because customers pay fees anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:13:24
Although theoretically this is good work, take it with a grain of salt people
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:14:03
Not really if they see that enough people are upset they might change. At current numbers I agree it isn’t much.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:20:51
I’ve been using Quadriga for 6 months, never had an issue. I found their support a little slow but helpful. This post is worrisome though, I hope it all works out.

@_date: 2018-01-11 21:59:08
Actually the # of segwit transactions has been pretty stable in the 8-12% range for the past couple months, not really increasing
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:47:48
Not buying this narrative
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:46:45
I think futures had some effect but people are exaggerating its effect on the market. Face it bitcoin is unpredictable and it is difficult to understand its price movements, we overestimate our understanding of rises or drops, especially short term.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:15:19
Ok but this encourages people to think of Bitcoin as a money making scheme, which is not thinking big picture. The fact that it is a good investment is just a positive side effect of a technology that is going to flip society on its head.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:59:52
Exactly the issue is exchanges. What can be done to encourage them to activate segwit? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:29:10
That’s true actually, Green Address would be a good segwit iOS wallet
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:35:45
Well that plan has been suggested, hasn’t seemed to work
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:23:48
The account has clearly been taken over be Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:34:14
I wish I was smart enough to have the solution. I just want to start a discussion that I think needs to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:02:42
My dad calls it bitcomb, gets me every time 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:49:10
Man you serious? Just google it
Edit: ok perhaps I should have wrote “benefits”
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:32:37
Isn’t segwit considered “opt-in”?
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:23:32
Thanks man, I really appreciate the feedback :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:37:36
If the government regulates cryptos it will just become them doing the insider trading instead
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:54:33
Thank you!

People are buying as speculators because they hope that bitcoin tech will continue to develop with LN and atomic swaps. Of course today Bitcoin is not very useful. One day it could be a functioning worldwide currency. Remember people bought internet stocks as speculators. Some people got burned. But in the end those that understood the power of the internet benefited. Employers will pay employees in bitcoin if bitcoin has mainstream usage. Customers will pay bitcoin , and employers wont bother to convert it to fiat or another currency because thats a waste of time.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:37:22
Today that is the case, one day hopefully people will be able to earn bitcoin from employers.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:00:48
Of course its unstable it will only be stable when its worth zero or when its adopted by a large portion of the population. Does it really need to be stable? I have no problem with it going up and down in value because I believe in the long term growth of Bitcoin. I might be wrong but I think it’s well worth the risk.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:40:07
I love this, thank you for sharing
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:16:35
Its a speculative commodity for now, but there is plenty of interesting developments in process like lightning network
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:41:56
This is stupidly good, well done.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:06:27
They are consequences or arent? The word consequences does not imply that it is bad.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:11:07
Youre acting like something that gains value is bad lmao
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:02:20
If you believe in government protections than you have misunderstood the fundamentals of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is for people who have lost faith in the establishment after 2008 banking collapse and government bailouts.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:11:31
Lightning network bro, do some research
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:42:52
They will abandon fiat if bitcoin can scale. If you can send transactions quickly and at a low fee (I’m aware you can’t right now) anywhere in the world then people will use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not taking shortcuts like other cryptos. It is trying to scale in a decentralized way while maintaining security. This is very difficult to do, thus it will not happen overnight. Bigger blocks is a band-aid solution. Side-chains seem to be promising but there are no guarantees, and it has to work the first time the devs cant afford to f*ck up. Again, the internet was not developed over night, it took many years to be user friendly. Bitcoin has similar problems and potential.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:34:36
Let’s be honest this will not hurt coinbase in the short term, they are clearly going to profit a lot from this. However, I do think in the long term this will come to hurt them.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:13:35
I feel like this is so important and not enough people in crypto realize this. The real enemy is the banks and the more we stick together, the better chance we have of freeing ourselves from the current financial system.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:03:06
I just don’t want people to think they will hear cha-ching forever! The government, banks or other cryptos will try again to stop Bitcoin at some point. But we can enjoy it for now :)
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:55:22
RemindMe! Of this in 2 years.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:43:11
Well you kind of have to get out of your comfort zone and ask what regulation really is. Because the government tells you their paper money has value does not necessarily make it true. In Venezuela their currency is worthless, despite the government backing. What makes something good for a medium of exchange? Something that cannot be replicated, something that is rare and lastly something easily transportable. This is what gives bitcoin value, it hits all these criteria better than traditional cash.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:02:03
Gold also has physical use. You can make valuable jewellery from it. And it has along history of value behind it. If people begin to believe that Bitcoin can’t improve transaction speed and lower fees, will it really hold its value? I think the lightning network holds a lot of promise and will be a key move for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:43:42
Any alt coin can copy bitcoins “censorship-resistant property”, I think bitcoin needs to continue to improve as a means of exchange if it wants to be a big player in the long term.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:39:11
The real utility other than the security (which is huge), is the fact that you can transfer wealth quickly anywhere in the world without trusting a third party (banks). Also the fact that more bitcoin cannot be “printed” unless the bitcoin community supports the idea (very unlikely). Bitcoin has also survived many attacks to prove its resiliency and value over time, other cryptos have not faced these challenges.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:36:35
Because bitcoin has a proven reputation with much more $ at stake and has survived through many crashes
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:04:48
Bitcoin cannot last as just a store of value, thats what it is right now because people hope it will become a primary means of exchange in the future. It either becomes a viable currency or it fails. I don’t see why anyone would want bitcoin if it had no future improvements for transaction speed, ease of use and lower fees.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:07:10
Volume is low because there are not a lot of new people joining crypto, currently a lot of hodling and not much selling or buying
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:38:20
Yeah that makes sense I guess it is difficult to get data that better represents the reality. I just wonder if some early adopters or developers will try to tilt bitcoin to their own benefit as it becomes more valuable.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:49:22
Ok I see your point, people will not support a change that somehow benefits the wealthiest. But will this be a barrier of entry for some people. They will feel as though it is unfair that so much bitcoin is already held by so few people that it is pointless for them to join now? (Personally I find it fair, I’m wondering if others will feel it is unfair)
