Truth. They are providing a service for which there seems to be demand and are simply capitalizing on un-captured BTC use demand.

Please note the quotations around that text block. Those are not my words though I had trouble finding the original source (lmgtfy). I ascribe to the belief that Bitcoins transcend the logic of traditional nation-to-nation based currencies.

I wouldn't worry too much mate. Bitstamp is considered quite a legitimate exchange obviously. They have an extremely high volume and I don't expect them to attempt to compromise that for anything.

Good luck buddy.

Paypal is kind of shiesty I'll admit. At the same time what Elon Musk has done since then is quite incredible.

I don't have time to give to that article ATM. I also cannot predict the long term future of BTC. All I am willing to assert is that in the short-long-term the price will probably only go up. Thank you for your input. I would appreciate any upvotes/dissemination of this article at your discretion.

This is largely an ideal and a hope. For a long time it seems we will be tied to bank accounts. Credit cards maybe not so much, but there are certain necessities in life that will be slow to adopt BTC (electricity, water bills, etc)

This is huge. Expect a price rebound.

Yes of course this is a given. Maybe I misspoke. All I meant to call attention to is that BTC is not quite a currency nor is it an equity. It lies in this hazy grey area that gives it inherent power. If your traditional institutional banks were your analogous stone wall, the Bitcoin infrastructure would very much be like water or even an amoeba.
