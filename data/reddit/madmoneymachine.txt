coinspy.io also does this (as I mentioned on my show I released today).
Caution: won't you also get notifications of all the SPAM transactions that people send to that address?

Ooooo. In other news, tellers at all banks in the US were arrested for giving dollars to people who did illegal things with them.
I suppose Shrem was arrested on his way back from the Miami Bitcoin Conference?

Someone check: Don't credit card companies have it in their terms and conditions that retailers cannot offer discount for purchases other than credit cards? I seem to remember stories about merchants offering discounts for cash and getting slapped around by CC companies.

If this really is Satoshi, let's all work to make it into GOOD news for Bitcoin. He seems like a decent man. Like Sheldon Cooper, he likes model trains. Hopefully Big Bang Theory will have an episode about Bitcoin soon. Finally, something to take the attention away from Empty Gox for a while.
Here's Dorian Nakamoto's letter to the editor in O Scale Trains:
**Who Made that?**
I would like to see manufacturer's 
names on the equipment photos in OST. 
I think it is a disservice. When an item 
looks good, we readers might like to 
purchase it. Your weathering article on 
the covered hopper (OST  had no 
manufacturer name.

A couple of suggestions:
1. Would like a way to save a history of the Address/Nonce combinations for sending and secret/Nonce combinations for receiving along with time.
2. An extra space at the end of a string causes an error.
3. I sent you back what you sent me (to test it). There is no way for me to confirm that you got it, is there? If you don't see the nonce, you'll never see the address and the funds won't show up in your wallet. I'd have to monitor the address to see if it is ever used. If it isn't, I'd want to send you the nonce again, making the history useful. Perhaps the history could even check the address to see if the funds were claimed.
Feels a little like throwing a twenty off the top of a tall building in the hopes you will spot it walking by on the street. :-) Still... pretty cool!

Haven't tried it yet, so I have a question:
How does the receiver get the nonce from the sender?

First of all, you came across as the opposite of nervous: confident and expert. Geez, I wish I was able do what you did!
Second: with the lengthy answers to your questions, you only had time to ask two questions anyway (joking, sort of, hahahaha)
Third: I can't believe how quickly that hour went by.

Yep. I got this too. Took me longer than normal to see that it was phishing. Getting tricky! Thanks for saying what the threat was. I killed the browser as soon as it came up, so I didn't know what it was attempting to do.

What percentage does Coinbase charge Overstock per transaction? Visa/MC/AMEX charge 3,4, or 5%? 
It does seem like Overstock could give a discount for paying with Bitcoin. But then Visa/MC/AMEX probably have it in their terms of merchant use that merchants can't do that.

One thing I recently came to realize that I like about alt coins is that the competition with Bitcoin helps keep the Bitcoin developers working toward "good." If the Bitcoin developers evolved into doing "evil," then a "good" alt coin could step in to take its place.
I'm hoping that Bitcoin thrives and itself becomes the "good" competition against the "evil" other forms of currency and payment systems.

Perhaps just invest the funds and put them in a paper wallet. The fees for the Bitcoin Investment Trust in 2014 will be 1.5% to get in, 2% per year, and 1.5% to get out. OUCH! Paper wallet fees: 0.0%

I'm getting tired of seeing these physical coins every time there is an article about bitcoin. They should at least wise up and show a QR code for their wallet. Kinda reminds me of the early days of the web when everyone said "H T T P : / / W W W"

I'm thinking that eBay acceptance of bitcoin will be more significant. But they wouldn't get a cut of the money then, would they? Ah, and that's the reason it could be so good.
