IDK BTC is $170 billion marketcap now, with a lot of coins missing the real cap is much lower.  That is not much money in it.  I still expect it to gain a place in money wiring for oil and international exchange.  The next generation is going to hoard some crypto like baby boomers hoard gold as well.  If BTC mania bubble was going on it would be up in the hundred trillions.  
$/BTC just sounds like a high price because it's a big denomination.  It's like pricing gold by 1k ounzes instead of $2,000/ounce it's $2 million/1k ounces.
There are more millionaires than there are BTC as well.  It's still early adoption phase.

"The world is changing towards the 'digital age' as predicted" it's the information age not digital
"With the internet e-Sports, VR, and now crypto-currencies we are truly moving there."  VR came out in the 80's it's still dumb.  e-sports are just people watching video games i'de argue it's less influential than video games were/are and they've been around since the 80's.

? people take out exactly how much they put in.  It's a trade it all averages out.
You can get more value out than you put in though.  Because the BTC value compared to fiat is going up.  That effectively takes value away from everybody not holding BTC, giving value to those that do.
So yeah they all can take out more than they put in, they are taking it from all of those that didn't put in as the value of the USD drops.

What the coins are worth when you trade for example ETH-BTC is an opinion.  When you traded, when you received your coins, do you even own them?  That is all up in the air.  When you cash out to USD it is not.  
Pretty easy to just pay on gains when you trade to USD and not just going between crypto-coins.  You are sill doing your civic duty and paying taxes, just not in the middle when it's stupid.

You don't have to print BTC and hand it out at banks and then reprint them.  You also don't need a 3rd party to exchange it like USD in a bank account or a CC company.  It is more liquid than the USD.  You can do direct transfers without an intermediary across the globe in the billions for penneys instead of spending millions on guards and trucks.
It only has high fees for a short while which is right now, probably going to be less than a year in the BTC history.  The scaling will be fixed.  Even if BTC has to fork and adopt another blockchain tech like ripple.  You just copy the public ledger and run transfers on a new algorithm scheme.  That is why alt coins are going to crash and are a bubble.
Please do some google research.

This is why it's not a bubble.  Normies see it on the news but still can't buy any.
In the US use coinbase, people hate on them but it's the easiest and has the most users.  Only good in 48 states, two of them won't let coinbase operate.
Also it probably got denied by your bank and not the exchange.  Call them and dump your account if they did.

BTC has the most money and best developers though.  It's the most secure because of the price as well.  It's also the least exclusive and fairest coin in that regard because it was first.  
With the best developers people are speculating it will take back it's share of the market, if BTC has instant cheap transactions in the future alt coins become worthless.

No it isn't, if they go bankrupt for any reason you are SOL on your crypto.  You are doubling your risk.  Only the USD is federally protected.
Hell if one of their employees goes rouge and you have a couple million dollars worth of crypto they can just take it and you are SOL.  They will claim you lost it to a phishing site.
Also bookmark your exchange, phishing sites can look legit and ask for your 2FA or the pin they texted you.  They just take the look of the actual site and put in your password and name on it when you give it to them, then enter any 2FA when you do that too, they pull up a copy with your coins and when you transfer it looks the same, until your coins don't go to where you sent them.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:20:21
File a lawsuit against the exchange, it may very well be on them still.  You didn't log into the account and verify the trade.  You think credit card companies wouldn't love to stick us with all stolen card transactions?  This is the same, it's their site and security not yours.

BTC will skyrocket when oil trades start happening with it.  It's easier than USD or gold and sticks it to the US government.  In fact all the countries using USD instead of their own will switch to crypto, it's harder to fake and easier to use when you don't have a US bank nearby.

Day trading is not a healthy investment strategy.
If you buy bitcoin as an investment, you believe it will be adopted.  Which would put the price way higher than it is and it would be the currency so you don't need to cash out, you did when you bought BTC.
If you sell you are just day trading.

Technological and financial revolution, wrapped in a ponzi scheme.  
Greed is why is goes up and down so much.  People just investing don't believe in the tech and don't see it going anywhere so they panic.  The only other person I know that got in at ~$11k watched it climb to ~$20k then panicked sold when it went back to ~$11k.  He invested for just a week or two, pure greed. 
If you believe it will be widely used someday then it is very undervalued with a market-cap of ~$200billion right now.

BTC is also the fairest, in a way.  
Alt coins like ripple have tons owned by very few.  You can't have an economy run on a crypto with 10-60% owned by just a few.  If you have a lot of BTC you either bought it for fiat or supported it the whole way.  And you probably sold some or most off for money along the way spreading it out.

If BTC starts to fall behind another coin because the alt coin's solution to fully scale is correct, BTC will fork to that.

You can keep the files in your email and on your encrypted computer HD and even if somebody gets your written down passwords they can't get to the file without the passwords you use every day as they are behind that as well.

"you can check if the bill you have is valid by scanning the QR code".  No you can't, all that does is see if there is bitcoin at that address, it does not validate the bill in any way.
This has no advantages over just using fiat, it only has negatives.

Little difference though.  He let it grow to 50% he could take some out and buy other assets at any time, with the pile of investments he has now he's choosing to keep 50% in BTC.

Doubt it, I don't think BTC will ever be in the range where 10% of the population in 1st world countries could just buy one.  There are only 16 million coins and it is on everybody's radar now.  
I think ~14% of the US has 10k sitting in a bank account.  Thats already 42million people in the US alone.  
There are more millionairs in the world than there are bitcoins.  I'm sure they would buy one for a measly 3k.

If you are using an account service like TENX instead of doing the transactions directly in BTC, what the hell is the point. 
You can just use your bank account and pay in fiat, then pull money from GDAX by selling BTC.  That is all your in-between service is doing for you because you want to pay them instead of doing it yourself.
The point of crypto is to remove those services.  What you are doing is no different than having a bank account at tenx

The scaling issue has made BTC lose a lot of market share to alt coins, like from 95% of the market to 60%.  
When the scaling is fixed it's going to be a wild ride.  Alt coins are going to die and bcash will be first on the chopping block.  The consolidation and dominance may then push BTC to a million.

Yeup, Bcash lost the fight when it's common name became Bcash.
It's just a terrible alt coin now. LTC, Ripple, IOTA, Doge all better.  
Not to mention the $400mil worth of Bcash that got mined at the fork for basically free.  BTC will drop when Bcash dies to 0 because of the FUD.  Will be quite a good point to buy BTC because it'll rocket up afterwards.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:30:44
I think this will happen.  Normal people don't hold gold, at least not young people.  That is too close to just hiding money under the mattress and could be stolen.
But they do want to hold some BTC.

Indeed, 
It is also the perfect storm for the rich and powerful, you can hide your money, receive bribes, and avoid taxes.  Very hard for anybody to stop you using bitcoin.  Those are the same people making these policies and it is in their interest to make bitcoin secure and valuable.

Yeah, and when you don't get access to your account for 2 weeks and no indication from customer support about anything, yet still cash checks just fine you get sued.
If you can't access your money and they won't respond file in small claims for &lt;$3k
when they get 10,000 small claims cases individually filed they will get their shit together real fast or stop taking money they can't process.

BTC had ~95% market share for years, only now with slow transactions are others getting a cut.
If BTC solves all it's problem it very well might go back to 95%
I mean why bother with other coins when everything can be on BTC.
If every country could print and use USD fairly, it would be the only fiat.

Imagine people start using it instead of a foreign currency (USD) to trade oil.  You think they give 2 shits about a 30 dollar fee while trading millions?   Look at Iraq loading trains with people with briefcases full of lead and one with gold to transport money.  Now they can just transfer BTC.  The US sending pallets of $100 bills for the war effort in Iraq.  Now can just send BTC.
The USD will crash and burn, good news for people with student loans and mortages.  Bad news for people who want a job.

Seems more like people trying to manipulate and screw with a brand new exchange in the first few minutes. 
Also a bunch of people placing giant buy at market orders like idiots.  The buy at market orders bought everything on sale and then the huge price made a shit ton of people put up sell at market orders.  This got way ahead of the people wanting to buy and was going to execute all the way down to $0.01.  So they halted the exchange.  
Then people got scared and started selling crypto like crazy because they have weak hands.
I can't feel that bad if you got screwed, you chose to go nuts on an exchange in the first few minutes of launch, like that is risky and you are doing it to try and make a quick buck.  It isn't investment or believing in the technology and using it.  It is just a wolf of wallstreet move.  Nobody who wants to play safe got involved in an exchange in the first few minutes of launch or gives  a shit.
Is this a BTC reddit or a day trading reddit?

I think the core wallet now keeps 100 addresses to be used, so you only need to backup if you have used 100 addresses for change or receiving.  And you can set it to generate a bunch more if 100 are not enough.

The current fees are to high, nobody is using bitcoin for anything but an investment.  A few dollars to move a thousand is fine.  A few dollars to move &lt;$100 is not.
This is compounded by the fact that the miners dictate the code, 51%.  Maybe the community can push for a better upgrade but so far they can't.
The question is why is it so high?  It has no utility at that price, other coins are better and at 1% of the price.  The answer is the 'brand name', which is driving people to invest.  That makes it a bubble.
