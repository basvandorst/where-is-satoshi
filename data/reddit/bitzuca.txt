that would be the sweetest thing..
@_date: 2017-02-25 23:20:54
interesting approach, thanks.
@_date: 2017-03-21 07:48:49
It is working fine for me... 
Summary: 
1-price fluctuation not much affected by the hardfork issue; 
2-segwit could (and should) be activated now but miners don't want 'cause they're making tons of money with transaction fees;
3-Dash is overvalued right now. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 08:32:13
Damn, you exposed the whole plan... Now we gonna need to get our smart money out of the market again before is too late :)
@_date: 2017-04-25 20:40:41
Not true. Just watch the chart in coinmarketcap - LTC follows the exact same pattern of BTC, with the difference that BTC restart to grow in 2016 while LTC is starting to grow just now... Besides, I wouldn't call an asset that has managed to survive since 2013 in this wild crypto environment a shitcoin. Like I said, I want both to succeed. I think they can perfectly complement each other in a base of 1 to 1/4 of value BTC x LTC.

@_date: 2017-04-25 17:49:35
Well, maybe... But it is performing much better than BTC lately, specially in terms of governance and agreement. Anyway, I hold both and I wish them to succeed. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 11:23:53
yeah, close your bank account and go try to pay for the parking lot, or a sandwich or a beer with BTC in a daily basis... 
Majority of people are still bank slaves, this is the sad reality and it wont change in short term
@_date: 2019-01-08 10:26:32
How they are gonna convert their crypto to FIAT again, when they need to buy and pay for real sutff in the real world, genius?
@_date: 2019-01-08 10:33:09
BS. 
There are some nerds living purely on crypto, no more. Specially yellow vests, who are in general regular working class people. 
The vast majority of people out there dont even know what is a BTC wallet, dont be deluded

Fuck... it all make sense now!

Auwww ur so romantic... how old are you? I also think BTC is cool and bla bla bla, but I am here for the profit. 
I dont have dozen of analysts working for me to gather information, make predictions, calculations and targets like this guy. When a whale like him open his mouth to state something, you should at least pay attention because they have a way bigger background to base their statements than you. If you dont do so, you are an idiot. 
Of course he wants to manipulate the price, so what? Dont be naive.
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:26:10
Well, back in 2016 when he said BTC would hit 10k, I asked myself who is this guy? Then I saw in his profile he was an early investor of Hotmail, skype, tesla, space\-x and others... Im glad i listened him and bought BTC at 1k.
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:44:45


This is so stupid in so many levels...
So, you have spare cash in December and you buy at $19k, instead of waiting for a correction to be able to buy 3x more for $6k one month later.
If you don't understand the market cycles and its inherent manipulation in price, you are the 'sheeple' here.

When an investment fund makes a 'prediction' they are obviously taking all possible factors in consideration, dumbass. Of course any black swan event can happen any moment. An asteroid can hit earth tomorrow, so what? You don't make predictions anymore? 
Besides, I don't think a guy like Draper, who was an early investor in Hotmail, Skype, Tesla, Space\-x and others is "an idiot" at all. He is a very successful venture capitalist and now he is going all\-in in Bitcoin and blockchain. He is certainly better in 'predictions' than you. Thats why he is a smart\-ass billionaire and you are an ignorant poor.

2400, dip 2000, 3.5k
@_date: 2018-04-13 10:24:32
It took a decade to hit 10k and a month to hit 20k, it is called parabolic move.
Why would adoption grow? Have u ever heard about blockchain?

He will probably be dead by 2022
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:42:46
Well... if your withdraw limit is 2k per day, you simply shouldn't deposit and trade more than that, if you have the intention to withdraw it fast.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:47:53
I think the blocks won't be nearly empty anymore... at least till BTC solve its issues
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:08:55
You can't put FIAT money in Poloniex, it only trade alts.
To buy BTC with old money try Localbitcoins or Coinbase/Kraken/Gemini etc.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:24:39
I just transfered 5 LTC between two exchanges and kept an eye on the block explorer - it took less than 2 minutes to get the first confirmation and about 5 minutes for 3. Thats very good so far.

GO BITCHCOIN !!
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:50:32
I have put 1/3 of my life savings in BTC back in January, and let the rest in the bank. 
Today I regret... not placed 2/3 instead.
@_date: 2018-04-13 10:15:59
I don't care about the bitcoin fomo. I am here because of the price, and a little bit because of tech.
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:58:53
I'm logged at Polo right now; seems it is just fine.
(Level two verification always sucks. Mine took almost two months to complete.)
