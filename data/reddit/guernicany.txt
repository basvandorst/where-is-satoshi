Fundamentals haven't changed. Long term we are going up. This is a blip, BTFD and wait it out.

I know right, how can someone who just created an account have an opinion

I'd drag my balls across a mile of broken glass just to hear her fart through a walkie talkie

Exactly. Not that we've hit 5 figures, we should only meme each time it hits another ten thousand mark. So next in line is 20K. 
It means more if there is more time between big milestones. And imagine the people who don't really follow it, hearing it went from 10K to 20K in less than 3 months! A man can dream, no?

Bitcoin will be 80085.00 on August 8th at 8:00:85 or I will get breast implants.

They are moving from Amazon servers to their own private servers that can handle 100x the traffic. It's a big update. Hopefully we don't see any more down time after today.

So that explains why I'm unable to log in. Thanks guys, wasn't seeing this message when I tried to access the site.

This is why I put a majority of my crypto on a Trezor, before I even fully understood what a key or 24 word seed was. I was fine with an exchange when my holds were less than 5k, once the value started really going up though I needed to secure it. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:02:02
Based on past experience, I'm not FOMO-ing in, just Hodl and enjoy the ride! This is awesome! 
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:42:29
The 24 hour low is just over 4000... That's amazing in itself
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:00:08
The same way you buy them, only in reverse
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:44:08
I've held for 7 months and I'm halfway there.
To think people told me not to borrow against it to buy bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:27:28
Yeah, it's in your best interest to keep the amount of crypto you own private. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:32:55
I applied back in March and it took two weeks, glad to hear they improved their sign up process. I'm happy with them. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:55:56
Lots of people buy when the price goes up, that's why the price goes up
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:11:14
That was your first transaction. How many have you made since then? They hold a larger amount of BTC and ETH than what you deposited. So if you put in $500, bought BTC with all of it, then they hold $700 in BTC as collateral until your deposit goes through.
I just pulled those number from thin air, but that's how they operate. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:50:29
Very true. I bought back in the spring, but didn't really get it until I bought a Trezor and had to move it off the exchange. The hard part wasn't buying bitcoin, it was learning how to make a transaction with it, and thus learning what it is, how it works, and how to use it. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:46:11
Gpu's. Theyre sold out from people buying them to mine. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:24:20
Idk if it's the same dude or not
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:13:08
Why the fuck would the US ban BTC? Did I miss something? 
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:41:02
I disagree, even if it goes absolutely nowhere from here. The purpose was to make people aware of the deceitful practices that bitcoin.com employs to trick people into buying their shitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:14:46
Don't end it. Keep living and spite them
@_date: 2018-04-22 15:15:56
I believe that on chain scaling, such as bigger blocks, is a temporary fix. Off chain scaling is a legitimate, long term solution. 
Rome wasn't built in a day. BCH works better now, but eventually it won't. And the solution will be what BTC devs are working on right now.
@_date: 2017-05-02 12:10:20
Shit, should have stated it's a $13,000 loan.
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:04:25
Bitcoin is Bitcoin, bitcoin cash is Bitcoin cash. Strange how we have no problems with the other 8000 altcoins trying to claim the Bitcoin name, just Roger Ver and his army of sock puppet shills. So no, it's not stupid.
You realize when you go to the bitcoin.com website, they give you the option to buy bitcoin or bitcoin core? And there is no explanation as to how what they call bitcoin is actually Bitcoin cash? And you think it's A-OK to deceive people like that?
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:03:17
Hold for 5 years and talk to me then
The ups and downs in a day, week or month don't matter... The only positive is cheaper bitcoins. Every $100 you spend today is $10000 for your future self. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:34:07
That's the thing, I never take risk. Last year I made 52k, I am 32 and have (well, had) 114k in my 401k. I'm doing OK, have a 3 month emergency savings and no debt, even my vehicle is paid for. I need a little risk. Even my stock holdings are boring, high dividend stuff like XOM. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:55:36
It's always a good time to buy. Jump in! I just bought at $2600.00 yesterday and regret nothing
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:02:35
I got in a month ago and plan on buying $500 a week for the next 26 weeks, then smaller amounts from there on out. I will re-evaluate my position in 2023. 
You should too. Dollar cost average and hold.
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:34:41
It's crazy how events from 17 years ago can still Make your heart jump, and bring back a rush of feelings that I've only experienced on 9/11

As to a Roth, I never really thought to look into that, but to my understanding I won't be in a higher bracket when I retire compared to now so I thought it would make more sense to let it grow tax free.  I will look into it again. 
As to why I contribute so much, I always have. Once I became debt free I saved enough to have an emergency fund, saved for a home, and for a little bit in my 20's I was maxing my 401 contribution. Once I bought a house I stopped that because I couldn't afford it, but I still put as much in as possible.  
Also I was planning to DCA over 3-4 months, and be all in by September.
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:13:24
I think that knowing there is a finite amount, and even further knowing the exact number, means that even though more bitcoins are mined it shouldn't cause the price to fluctuate. 
Also, as to mining, there is an indirect correlation of miners to bitcoins mined. The more miners mining, the less bitcoins each miner gets. A smaller amount of miners means more bitcoins per miner over the same time period. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:23:34
Actually my employer puts in 3% automatically, regardless of what I put in. So I could leave it be, and max out a Roth.
 I thought it was more beneficial to invest in a 401k, since it is deductible on taxes now and grows tax free until you start taking distributions, never thought about how much taxes will be when I retire though. 
I am starting to diversify a bit more, and a Roth is a safe vehicle for retirement... Definitely something I'll be looking into.

I bought one coin on Gemini last week at 1280.00. I took a loan out yesterday, check is in the mail. I'm in it for the long haul. My plan is to sell off 30-40% as soon as it is worth enough to pay back the loan, then keep the other 60% until I have enough to put down on a vacation home. 
Its the first time I've ever taken a risk like this and I had some doubts, but it looks like odds are good that it goes up a substantial amount before going down. I'll just enjoy the ride! 
@_date: 2017-05-20 11:47:05
Sure did. Not that technologically literate, I can't even type. I understand where you're coming from though, I'm 32. You're referring more to if my 55 year old mother wanted in.

You don't need to report the fact that you own bitcoin - the only time you need to report it is if you realize gains: sell it or spend it.  If you hodl, you need not worry.
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:35:10
You're right on. If you're paid for services in bitcoin it's taxed as income. If you sell within a year, I believe any profits are also taxed in income. If you hold for longer than one year, you're paying capital gains on any profit you take from the sale.
I'm not a tax professional in any sense, I do my own taxes on turbotax and that's as far as it goes. But I have looked into taxes and bitcoin a bit for personal reference. 
Hopefully someone can elaborate a bit or point us to a thread that already has. Still new to reddit and learning how to navigate the site.

It took me two weeks, I applied back in February and got approval some time in March, I actually forgot I even applied. Got in when BTC was 1280.00 and ETH was 54.00, lucky me
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:14:12
My application took 2, maybe three weeks. And that was over a month ago.

Happened to me too, on two different exchanges I signed up for but never used. I got over 250 emails from poloniex that my account was accessed, all by different IP addresses. I use 2FA on the main exchange and moved everything to cold storage already, so no worries.
But yes, seems to be a problem. Everyone be sure to secure your crypto. Already enabled 2FA on my email address and changed password there just to be safe. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:43:13
I bought my first dip! Yay!

Gemini was up and running for me, just have to get home so I can transfer it to my Trezor
