 Bitcoin is not like other asset to manipulate easily and say you have what you don't actually possess, investor should demand to see how many bitcoin they actually hold on the their custody to see they are not playing with customer holding by providing public key of their holding.
 If they are shorting the cash settle back and manipulate the price by selling what they collect from physically settle bitcoin is a crime; should be investigated by the FTC if truly like to protract the consumer. 
For now we just watch them play with fire, it will be funny to see when the day come and can't cover anymore and explode on their face. **Show lessREPLY**
