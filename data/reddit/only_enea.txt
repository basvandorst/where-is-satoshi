People get a kick out of shooting down other’s hopes when their own aspirations fail to reach a pleasant enough height. And so, to justify their shortcomings, they make sure nobody can succeed where they so miserably failed.

That 10% can go a long way. At least you’re willing to dabble. Open mindedness and risk are crucial for growth in a society where development never ceases.

We do? I thought we stopped using precious metals to back our currencies after the Gold Standard. Or maybe that was just gold lol. I’m not as educated on the matter so any information on it would be vastly appreciated.

Not concrete, but this suggests that the cybertruck’s aerodynamics are pretty impressive for a truck.

Gotcha. In that context, it’s pretty obvious isn’t it? From bartering to coins to paper to credit to crypto? 
Each evolution provided some sort of benefit that the prior didn’t. Only question is, how long did it take the masses in each stage of the evolution to adopt the newer currency? I’d assume each stage progressed faster than the last, especially being in the age we are in now. Technology, as a whole, doesn’t wait on anyone. Except maybe those issuing bills against any tech that slightly challenges their way of life.
