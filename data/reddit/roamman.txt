Oh, thanks for clarification :)  
I agree with it as well. Let's see what bitcoin can do with LN, though.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:42:37
Exactly. Everyone can invest in it unlike other investments

Keep us updated

Yeah, thanks man. I'm gonna watch this all night

One billion bit by bit? Even your grandchildern won't have time to cash it out in thier life time

Ah, I heard this name. Didn't know it was the same thing. Do you use it?
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:04:44
Ah, I see now. Thanks. But my bitcoins will be safe anyway?

What will happen if I split them unsafely? What you mean by risk losing, new coin or bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:22:00
Yes, I like their concept. Strange that few people reccomend it. What do you use beside this exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:33:58
Okay, thanks

Now it's complicated. If I don't split them, I won't have B2X and I can lose those B2X. On the other hand, if I split them, and can send B2X and lose Bitcoin. What can I do?

Can you elaborate on that please? What shapeshift solve exactly? Can you explain in detail what you do with you bitcoin on shapeshift? Why convert them to another coins 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:00:41
Cool. It works if you do the same on any other exchange, right?

Very interesting question. I saw an ICO recently that wants to solve the problem of fraudulent voting system. But how can they do it? What if government rejects this blockchain voting? What can we do then
