Yes, particularly smaller exchanges that are running on shared hardware.
That seems like a bad idea anyhow, but it also seems like something that isn't unlikely to have happened in a startup that has grown very quickly.

As best I can tell, that's an attempt to muddy the waters.
There are three vulnerability paths that were outlined in the disclosure - two related to "Spectre", and one related to "Meltdown". Spectre has been known about for at least a few months, and as best I can tell is exploitable only in very specific circumstances that are unlikely to occur in the wild. Meltdown, however, basically requires only local code execution (which includes Javascript).
Also, because these are firmware-level bugs, they impact VMs. That's my concern - if you're running anything with access to a crypto private key, that key is potentially readable by any other process *on the physical machine*. That means that if you have a hot wallet running on a Linode VM and I spin up a Linode VM that resides on the same machine, at least in theory I could read the contents of the memory that your VM is using and read your private key.
Note: I don't know for sure if Linode is susceptible to this, so this isn't a hit against them. Any cloud deployment that isn't running on dedicated hardware should be vulnerable, per my understanding.

It has a `requirements.txt` - you should be able to do `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Better yet, use [pipenv]( then all you have to do to set up the project in an isolated virtual environment is run `pipenv install`. `pipenv run python ticker.py` runs it.

I'm disputing the idea that this belief was always ubiquitous in the Bitcoin community. This used to be mostly fairly extreme libertarians. Try asking this question in and I bet you'd get a different response.

I suspect that Bitcoin, while surely uncommon there, is more common than gold.
Also, Bitcoin is better than gold in terms of utility for getting around capital controls. You can't take a fortune in gold with you out of the country, unless you're paying off everyone on the way and have connections to arrange your own transport. If you're that level of "rich", you're not keeping your wealth in Zimbabwean dollars, though.

My family already doesn't use publicly-funded schools - we homeschool. Alternatives would include private and parochial schools.


Until very recently, there was no publicly-funded firefighters where I lived either. Much of the US is covered by volunteer firefighters, and are funded by fire dues paid by property owners.
Don't pay your fire dues? Either accept a very large bill for the call-out, or the firefighters will make sure things are contained to your property in order to protect your neighbors.


People who solicit services should pay for those services. People who cannot or will not pay for those services should rely upon charity.

Having no choice is not theft.
Would you rationalize that a chattel slave in the antebellum South was stealing from his master, because he "took for granted" the food that he ate and the clothes he wore?
Your argument that using services provided by government is tantamount to theft applies equally to that slave.
Further, the money used to pay for those services is belongs not to "the community", but to the individuals from whom it was taken. There is in fact theft taking place - but I am not the perpetrator.

It's possible that we'll see a rally in the next few weeks, triggered by the crisis in Greece.
Note that I said "triggered by", not "because of". If the price goes exponential again, then it will be because of a positive feedback loop of the price going up, encouraging people to buy, causing the price to go up. This will happen again, and when it does, it will eventually crash again and stabilize above the previous baseline.
If the price shoot up again, *don't panic*. Buy in, then sell on the way up until you've regained your initial fiat investment - after that, you're playing with value that doesn't come out of your bottom line.
Trust me. I've been through this three times now - I know that of which I speak.

I spoke about my intentions a bit in the other post - but the overall idea here is that I want this to be a single package that will facilitate writing apps to deal with cryptocurrencies in the same way Requests makes working with HTTP easy.
It already supports Python 2.7, 3.3, and PyPy, and it should work with most other versions. I'll add targets to support once the library is a tad more mature.
I've added built-in support for Bitcoin and Litecoin, along with the tooling necessary to easily support arbitrary altcoins that are based upon the Bitcoin codebase (which, off the top of my head, is all of them).
Once I get this to the point I'm happy with it, I'd like to write an online marketplace that allows buyers to use any currency they'd like - from traditional fiat to Bitcoin to the most obscure altcoin - and transparnetly convert them to the merchant's currency of choice automatically.
While I'm not explicitly asking for donations, I would very much appreciate [support through Gittip]( Gittip works through fiat, but there is also a Bitcoin address on my profile page there if you'd prefer.

Perhaps. I've met comparitively few people who know much about economics, the US Federal Reserve system, or the financial regulatory regime who are okay with it. The vast majority move to toward libertarianism the more they learn about any of these topics.  Granted, not all of them are going to become AnCaps, but there seems to be (anecdotally) a strong correlation between knowledge in those areas and people moving away from collectivist policy.




While ideology is important for me and for many of use in this subreddit, there are several other reasons to use Bitcoin. International remittance, speculation, tax avoidance/evasion, etc. None of these things require ideological motivation.


Yep - these are some of the (often ignored) negatives to Bitcoin in its current state. Each of these must be solved, or the advantages must greatly outweigh them for Bitcoin to reach the level of a national currency of an industrialized nation.


Absolutely true. There's a huge network effect going on within out community though, and opening access to other communities will strength that. We'll be able to leverage the tools we've built to tip the balance in Bitcoin's favor over time.

To be blunt, only accept PayPal from people whose home address you know for a fact, and from whom you could reasonably find and kick their ass to get your money back.
Seriously. There is no effective recourse for any non-face-to-face exchange of value. You either choose a system which is non-repudiatable (Bitcoin), you rely on the system's own mechanism for dispute (PayPal, banks), or you take your chances.
At this point, you had no reason to believe that PayPal's dispute process would protect you. You learned a hard lesson - but honestly, it could have cost you much, much more.

The intent of this can be accomplished by publishing nLockTime transactions.
GreenAddress.it uses these today to ensure users that they will be able to access their coins in the event of service failure. Every time you recieve coins into your Gait wallet - including change - you can get an email with an nLockTime transaction appended. If, after your set time has elapsed, you want to move the coins you can do so by using that email plus your private key. Otherwise, Gait's server also has to sign the transaction.

2. The user sends back the nonce, signed nonce, and a Bitcoin address they claim to control.
3. The server verifies that the nonce was the one it sent, then verifies that the signed string proves control of the provided address. That address is then cross-referenced with the user list and the user associated with it is logged in.

After reading translations of Japanese law for the past hour, I'm fairly sure you are legally entitled to your funds being returned.
You sent the BTC to MtGox by mistake; hence, they remain legally your property and not the property of MtGox. Since only property of MtGox is covered under bankruptcy statute, I see no legal reason they can't be returned immediately.
I would contact the trustee assigned by the court, [Mr Nobuaki Kobayashi of Nagashima Ohno &amp; Tsunematsu]( The email that's been made public to date in the bankruptcy proceeding is mtgox_trustee I'd start by emailing that address, then work on ways to contact Mr Kobayashi directly - which, given the amount of money in play here, would include flying to Tokyo and sitting in the lobby of NO&amp;T until I spoke with someone who could at least nail down how it's going to be handled.

If you're sending or generating recieving addresses, I'd go with Coinbase. Their interface looks much more professional than Bit-Pay's, which is actually pretty important if you're going to link to it from an eCommerce site. That said, I've heard that Bit-Pay have better support for commercial clients - so take it with a grain of salt.
Finally, I'll point out that both Coinbase and Bit-Pay require that you trust them, at least with the funds being transferred. At least with Bit-Pay, you can set it up so that incoming payments are forwarded to cold storage.

I'm an anarcho-capitalist, and I've been passionate about Bitcoin for several years now. I oppose state regulation in all forms.
Even so, my primary means of supporting Bitcoin are evangelism, use, answering questions, helping beginners, and contributing software tools to the community.
If my philosophy is correct - and obviously, being that it is my philosophy I believe it is - the arc of human history is bending toward statelessness. Arguing with people on the Internet isn't going to change that. While I'm happy to debate from time to time, I'd much rather help someone and moving society ever so slightly toward a time when the financial networks are not controlled by government.
I have personally helped several people whose beliefs are antithetical to mine get started with Bitcoin and better understand the technical features. From authoritarians to anarcho-communists, anything that can be done to lessen our cultural presumption of the role of the state is a good thing.

No, I don't watch GoT but I know what you're saying.
I don't think I'm being clear on my position. I'm not saying this sort of thing isn't effective. I'm not saying you're a bad person if you "got a kick out of it" - *I* sure paused for a moment to view the photo.
All I'm saying is that I would never associate myself with the entity that decided to use painted women as advertising. It's offensive to a large number of people and it shows their lack of good judgement.
I cringe a little every time I see things like this in small, new communities. They'll get away with it for a while and people will have fun. The models themselves probably don't have a problem with it either - but the time will come when the community gets big enough that enough people are offended to bring it to the forefront, and then it will be a big mess and have the potential to tear the community apart.

There are several industries that are very poorly served by the Visa/MC networks. Pornography is one of them, but my experience lies more with firearms and associated goods.
At one point, I was developing a CMS platform for firearms industry professionals - sort of a cross between a curated directory and Medium, so people with lots of money to spend on very high-end custom guns would be able to follow craftsmen, and craftsmen would be able to publish an effective website at the same time.
Every major merchant processor I spoke with refused service because some of the pages on my domain would include independent customers selling firearms and parts... even though I was only wanting to charge a monthly fee for publishers.
I reached out to some of the more tech-oriented processors, and they were also unable to help. The restrictions come from the credit card companies, not the processors. It's a huge pain.

I would argue that it doesn't matter whether this is good or bad for the Bitcoin economy. If there is profit in it - and I believe there is - then someone will eventually provide the service.
I also believe that reservoir of untapped revenue will never exist unless and until it's easy for people to use Bitcoin. It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation, but with a key difference. 
Consider that merchants already pay at least something like 1.5% for credit card transactions. Small merchants usually pay something closer to $0.25 + 2.5%. Once people start using Bitcoin-backed credit cards, there's ample opportunity for those businesses to accept Bitcoin directly and recover those fees.
In other words... chill. If Bitcoin is what we claim it to be, then the market will drive adoption in the longer term.

If it's constant or predictable, yes, it can be good.
Economic growth is basically a function of the application of capital. For those who possess large amounts of capital, loaning it to others at a certain rate is one way accumulate more.
With a deflationary asset like Bitcoin will be once we reach saturation and  peak supply, it doesn't make sense to loan capital unless you expect a rate of return greater than the rate of deflation.  If you expect 2% per year deflation, loaning someone money at 1.5% interest will cost you money. Loaning someone at 4% interest might even cost you money once you factor in servicing costs and risk.
With an inflationary currency, money at rest loses value. There is a positive pressure to loan money.
The result of a Bitcoin-based economy wouldn't be "no one would loan money" - it would be "no one would loan money cheaply". In order for a business to take a loan, they would need a solid plan and would have much higher barrier in terms of convincing the capital holder that they were a safe bet.
In total, the economy would grow much more slowly with Bitcoin over traditional fiat - but because businesses who *were* leveraging capital would have had to work much harder to get it, far fewer would fail.  You'd see approximately linear economic growth with very few recessions, as opposed to the near-exponential growth of today (with associated periodic recessions).

If a transaction hasn't yet been incorporated into a block, then it may as well not exist.
If I sign an ANYONE_CAN_PAY transaction and pledge 1BTC, if I otherwise drop my balance to less than 1BTC at the address with which I signed the transaction before the aggregate total is reached then *my portion* of that transaction is no longer valid, and not included in calculating the total pledged if the transaction is submitted.

I started with Bitcoin in 2011, and while I've been a vocal advocate both online and in person, I've not harnessed my skills as a developer to it. I wish I had, but as usual life has gotten in the way.
My current attempt at changing that is [cryptocoin]( a Python library that's intended to help developers work with Bitcoin and derivatives. I'm trying to optimize it for developer happiness and follow best practices in its development - but honestly, the lack of input and peceived interest has been a bit of a morale killer for me.
I've also worked with [Gittip]( to advocate for Bitcoin adoption, with some success.
I'd very much appreciate it if you or anyone else with a passion for this stuff would take a minute to just make a list of the tools and services that you think the community needs.

There is some innovation happening in the altcoin world.
Off the top of my head, Blackcoin has a semi-fixed number of coins - there was a week of mining, then everything beyond that is a 1% growth per year based on proof of stake. With an effectively fixed supply of BC in circulation, price behaves much differently than continually-mined coins.
Darkcoin has coinjoin at the protocol level, and X11 mining.

Keeping your savings in Bitcoin is not really a suitable application yet. It will be in the future once prices plateau and stabilize, but for now it's much more in the "speculative investment" if you're holding coins.

My advice: Don't put all your money in Bitcoin. Put 25% or so in, then put the rest in something else. Say... 25% in gold, buried deeply somewhere and 50% in a tradional stock portfolio.
If legal confiscation is your concern, then cut the stock and go 50/50 gold and Bitcoin.
The long and short of it is that I just don't see a case where 20 years passes and Bitcoin isn't either dead or triumphant. You'll be 50% poorer or stupidly wealthy.
Finally, I can offer sound advice on how to bury a precious metals cache. I'm a metal detectorist as well as a Bitcoin enthusiast, and the last thing you want is for some guy like me to find your gold while you're incarcerated.

I'd argue that it's also not unreasonable for a person running an exchange anonymously to expect to continue to do so.
Personally, I'm not sure if it's better or worse that BTC-e isn't tied to an individual. Not being so means there's a much lower tolerance for "shady stuff" happening before people flee. MtGox was non-anonymous, and the warning signs have been present for literally years at this point.

When you think about it, a Bitcoin address is as far removed from a public key as a public key is from its private key.
Bitcoin isn't so much a "public/private key system" as a "public/protected/private" key system.  The "protected" bit is what we call a public key, but isn't actually made public until a transaction is made.
If you don't reuse addresses, the public key will never be shared for an address that controls coins.

This is an issue I've been concerned about even before Bitcoin came on the scene. To this point, there are basically two ways open source development has been funded.
The first is by the developers' day jobs. As you pointed out, this is by far the most common. People develop things for personal satisfaction and to "scratch their own itch". My concern with this is that it's very difficult to scale - if you're working 50 hours per week and a library or application you've been working on at night suddenly takes off... who handles support requests? Who deals with the onslaught of pull requests, bug reports, and feature requests? It quickly gets to the point where the author isn't able to both write code and manage the community.
The second way is through what amounts to patronage. When jQuery exploded into the mainstream, Mozilla picked up John Resig and gave him the title of "Javascript Evangelist". He was free to pursue what he was already doing in his spare time, and as a result jQuery was able to quickly grow and adapt to its newfound place.
What I want to see is a way for the community to directly give back to the people that provide great value to them. That's why I'm passionate about Gittip - it introduces the first way that I know of for an ad-hoc community of people to motivate and support individual who provide disproportionate value.

I'm looking for a service to do this now. I thought Coinbase would allow for it, but I can't find it on their site.
I'm happy, as a merchant, to accept the "risk" of holding the crypto while my customers' funds clear. My business is small and is primarily a means of generating income with which to purchase Bitcoin anyhow, so it doesn't matter one whit to me.
As far as I know, there is no way to have an invoice marked "paid" on my side before my customer has purchased Bitcoin and they've been released by the processor. It's not acceptable to tell my customer "Go here, set up an account, take a couple of days to hook up your bank account, buy 0.02 BTC, wait a week for it to be available, then come back to my site and pay your invoice".
I don't see why this should be any harder than paying a PayPal invoice with an eCheck. That's *still* not ideal, but it would work represent only a small percentage loss in conversion.

Flash powder like that is still a huge fire hazard. It tends to explode when exposed to flame, while gunpowder and smokeless powder burn unless inside a strong closed container.
I've seen people throw a cup full of smokeless powder into a campfire. There was a big flash and the fire was hotter for a moment, but it didn't explode. Likewise, throwing loaded ammunition into a fire is relatively safe. The pressure necessary to rupture the brass is so low that it generally won't propel the case or projectile fast enough to break skin. The reason it works in a firearm is because the walls of the chamber keep the brass from rupturing, and all of the force exerted on the bullet as it travels down the barrel.
Consider 20 35mm film canisters full of smokeless powder, with the lids securely glued, packed tightly together. The innermost canister has a fuse. If you lit that fuse, the innermost canister would "explode" (barely), and the rest of the canisters would be thrown outward. None of them would explode. If some burst open, their contents might burn - but again, not explode.
Now consider the same setup with flash powder. The lit canister would explode with far more force, first of all. Then the canisters around it, when exposed to the shock of being thrown away from the blast, would themselves explode.

I disagree - I use gait for security reasons.
If someone were to want to hack my coins, they'd need my PIN and gait's key. It's extremely unlikely that they'd get access to both.
Every time I send a transaction, I get an email with the nlocktime transaction for that change address. If someone had access to both my PIN and my email, they'd get my coins once the nLockTime transactions were valid.
Requiring you to redeposit your coins means the timer is reset for those transactions. If they didn't do it, someone could hack your email six months later and steal your coins.

redepositing is a good thing. I've been using gait for long enough now that I've set the nlocktime to much longer than the default. I trust them not to go away, at least enough so that I'm willing to risk not having access to my funds for a year if it happens.

I try to shop with merchants who share my ideological views. I sincerely hope that many of them do not report the income to their government's tax authority. I'm more than willing to spend 3-5% more on a purchase to deprive the government of 30-40% of the total.
I also use gift cards through Gyft quite a bit. They're convenient, and they provide a 3% bonus back that completely offsets the fees involved in acquiring coins.


I have profited, yes - I'm not going to say just how much, but I have said in the past that while substantial, my profits have not been life-changing. Nowhere near enough to retire.
I've never "cashed out" to USD for what it's worth. I've bought precious metals when I felt like I had too great a portion of my assets in Bitcoin, but I've never sold everything because of a lack of confidence in the market.
Buying an investment instrument without fully understanding how it operates is foolish. Buying Bitcoin as an investment instrument is *prima facie* evidence that you do not fully understand it IMO. It's a gamble at this point.
Bitcoin is young. It has a young ecosystem composed of young hackers and professionals, and interest mostly from the younger generation on Wall Street. The price runups are a function of increasing awareness, and the hype surrounding it being a "hot new thing". Well, it's not new anymore, and the hype is almost finished dissipating. We'll find the bottom soon enough, be it at $180 or $0.18, and only then will we see how this is going to shake out. I still firmly believe that Bitcoin's core concept, the blockchain, is revolutionary and will change the world in ways we don't yet fully understand, financially and otherwise.

gunpowder != smokeless powder != flash powder
Flash powder is sensitive to shock and friction, while both gunpowder and modern smokeless powders are comparitively very stable. Gunpowder draws moisture and produces lots of particulate when used, hence the development of smokeless powder.

Oddly enough, I sent ~55 millibits to a guy in Venezeula yesterday to see if he would be able to use it effectively. He'd converted 21 millibits to bolivares (local currency) within 24 hours, bought food and Christmas presents, and decided to keep the rest in BTC due to its relative stability. He'd never used Bitcoin before this.

With 51% of hash power, you get 51% of the blocks over time. That means you have approximately a 50% chance of being able to "undo" the most recent block at any given time.
Double-spends would be possible, but would only have a 50% chance of success with a single confirmation, a 25% chance with two confirmations, a 12.5% chance with three confirmations, and so on.

SHA256 isn't the blockchain though, it's only one half of what keeps it secure. The other half is RIPEMD-160.
As long as either of those hold, the blockchain is secure. Either or both may be replaced by concensus of miners. Therefore, the only way breaking a hash algorithm is going to hurt Bitcoin is if both SHA256 and RIPEMD-160 are broken before the network incorporates a new algorithm.

As for the MRAPs - your article's headline is wrong. DHS didn't "buy" them, they got them from the military, which has retired them. The manufacturing facilities for them are shut down and sold off, and with the winding down of military operations in Iraq, we have a ton of the things doing nothing. Does DHS need them? No, of course not. I suspect their buying them is more about creating make-work jobs to steal my children's labor than it is about civil unrest, though.

It depends.
My intuition tells me that the rise was slow enough that $50 USD / BTC is a level with some real support. From there...
$50-$75 is looking pretty bubbly. Still, it roughly coincides with the European Central Banks threat to steal 7-10% of Cypriot savings accounts. If that rise was due to Cypriots jumping into BTC as soon as they could move their Euros, then it wouldn't necessarily fall (and may go much higher).
There are what, 11m BTC in circulation? We've seen a $25 / BTC rise in value, so that works out to a $275m increase in value in a few days. It wouldn't take a lot of people moving substantial assets to get there, even discounting the second-order impacts of a bull market.

The societal impact of an assassination market's existence is not contigent upon it consistently paying out. It only matters that someone who is willing to actually commit the murder sees the site and is fooled.
If you're right and it is a scam, then the first murder that takes place for which it is publicly known that the market played a part will generate many, many markets - some of which will be perfectly and provably legitimate.
The cats's out of the bag. Bitcoin (and by extension, cryptocurrencies in generate) is reaching the point where it's an unstoppable force in world affairs. The impact it will have on our society in as yet unknown and unknowable.

When buying coins, you cannot bid higher than the lowest Ask.
This is good because it doesn't allow you to manipulate the "last" price, which I was trying to do. It seems like it would be bad though if you are trying to buy while the price is rising. If someone an ask for 0.01 CAD / BTC for a Satoshi, and used the API to do that repeatedly, wouldn't that effetively stop trading?

I fully support this - anonymous transactions are by their very nature voluntary, and therefore moral.
The effect of this on Bitcoin's public image is of no concern. The currency will succeed or fail based upon its own merits, combined with how badly the traditional, state-controlled system makes people want to jump ship.
We're not afraid of a newspaper coming out and saying we're big meanies. We're not even afraid of a guy in a suit with a position of "authority" saying that we're big meanies. Maybe he'll even send men with guns and try to take our stuff, since we're so mean. Good. Let them come - it will show the system for what it really is, and the attention will grow the Bitcoin community at a rate far beyond anything we could have done without their help.

The opposite is only true once a certain critical mass has been reached.
A dozen people disobeying will likely go without response, even it noticed. No need to disrupt the masses if there's no significant harm.
A few thousand people disobeying will necessitate a response. The growing number of people disobeying actually makes it *more difficult* for others to do so.
A few million people disobeying is a revolution, and the more people join the more likely it is to succeed.

Not at all - I understand how we all have our personal biases.
I grew up in a conservative state, raised by conservative parents. 
I hear the word "liberal", and I have to mentally force myself to not discount the argument out of hand. Intellecutally I know that *I'm* a liberal, and that the term is not an epithet. I grew up in a place where the word "liberal" was equivalent to "Progressive Democrat".
To make a sweeping generalization, I would say that a large part of this country and most of the world associate gun ownership with narrow-minded conservativism. Being a part of the firearms community, I know that the stereotype exists for a reason - but it's just a generalization. Probably one in four politically active gun owners are well into the libertarian camp.

There are legal protections given to corporations, limited liability chief among them, that make their current structure immoral. Those protections are given and enforced by government, not the corporations themselves.
There is nothing inherently wrong with incorporation is my point. In all of the instances above, someone made a decision that resulted in demonstrable harm. If it was an individual doing so, they should be held accountable. If that person was acting on accordance with the rules of the corporation, the shareholders should share liability in the same way they share profit.
Weaken limited liability laws if you want to see corporations that behave morally.

They've done a damned fine job killing off the drug trade - with marijuana in particular, that involves moving a bulky physical product across borders, then moving physical cash back in the other direction.
Making Bitcoin illegal would change its niche, but it's still too useful to go away.
As for killing the Internet - that's laughable at best. If they managed to do it, then there would be a revolution. I'm not talking about Anonymous marching somewhere, I'm talking about multi-trillion-dollar international industries crippled overnight. The entire economy would go tumbling down overnight, there'd be food shortages immediately, and starvation within a week.
How much cash do you think your local bank has on hand? Consider a major city, with millions of people trying to buy food and credit cards not working...
Finally - we'd set up a mesh network. If the government were to disable the "official" Internet backbone, they'd lose the nominal control over the medium that they have now. No, it wouldn't be exactly the same, but it would exist.

I'm just as happy to throw a few bitcents and throw in with another organization. In the end, I'm something of a cyrpto-anarchist, and I want to see Bitcoin succeed through whatever means happen to be the most effective.

Not necessarily. They have different utility.
I think there will be a handful - maybe a dozen? - competing currencies with a very liquid market between them and a different niche to fill.
Bitcoin is the first to achieve widespread adoption it appears - so it's likely to be worth the most for the foreseeable future. It's well-suited for saving and wealth protection, as well as unregulated transfer.
Litecoin, OTOH, has faster transaction processing, so it's more likely to be used long-term in physical retail where that is important.
It's possible that we'll see a protocol down the road with built-in *inflation*, or some sort of algorithmic price stabilization based on the expiration of unused addresses or the movements of currency within the system. These "features" probably don't appeal to most Bitcoin users (I certainly wouldn't want them), but we're living in an age where anyone with the ability to hack code can launch a virtual economy.

That said - AnCaps (or which I am one) and Libertarians are pretty much the vast majority of the Bitcoin user base at this point, and will likely remain so for some time. I don't believe having them in the sidebar is a negative thing at all. If there is a left-libertarian faction here, perhaps they should be represented as well. I know there are AnComs and AnSocs in Europe that are promoting Bitcoin usage for reasons antithetical to my own.

In the 18th Century, a Spanish Dollar was equal to 8 reales.
It was a regular practice to cut the coins into - halves, quarters, and eighths. This was so common that Spanish Dollar coins came to be known as "Pieces of Eight".
Each piece was a "bit" of the coin - so a bit is 1/8th of a dollar, or 1 real.
The name transferred to the US Dollar when the country was founded.

I don't disagree - but why would that need to be physical?
I paid my taxes with a check. That money sits in a bank account, which is just a register somewhere. That same bank account has had deposits in the past where I've sold Bitcoins on exchanges.
I understood your comment to mean that Blockbuster suffered from a problem different that that of Western Union, because their product was different. If that is correct, then I wholly disagree - WU's product is physical currency, and digital currency works just as well for that, be it in the force of a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, or a more traditional form like a balance in a bank account.

Yep - although, I suspect that many people wouldn't be willing to transact with him at all, greatly limiting his ability to use that wealth.


Provided, of course, that he didn't have political connections - and that he wasn't in fact a part of the political apparatus himself.
What is your recourse when the government itself, to whom you've given your implicit consent to be the only arbiter in this sort of matter, decides to take everything you have?
There's also the small matter that transacting with him in the first place *was completely voluntary*. Pirateat40 didn't threaten to send men with guns to your home, break down your door, steal your shit, shoot your dog, and throw you in a steel cage if you didn't give him a portion of your income.

Both sides of that war were in the wrong.
The Confederacy maintained that holding human beings as property was the proper order of a society (which is, obviously, evil). They seceded because of the growing cultural divide between the North and South. Slavery was absolutely a part of that divide, but so were things like the federal government placing tariffs on the export of raw materials and on the importation of manufactured goods.
The Confederacy relied on income from the export of cotton to Europe, and their meager manufacturing ability meant they imported most of their finished goods. Both sides of this were taxed heavily.
The Union had a comparitively huge manufacturing base, and as a result did not export raw materials to such a degree. The raw materials they did produce were mostly things like iron and coal, which were consumed by domestic factories. Those factories supplied the Union and made goods available for export.
The Confederacy saw their representation in the federal government slipping away - new territories were turning into states, and it was a fight to keep the ratio or slave states to free states at a draw. If they lost that fight, they knew the federal government would continue to abuse them economically through the elimination of slavery and through the continued imposition of tariffs that only harmed the South.
Upon secession, the Union could have simply walked away. They could have worked with the Southern interests to devise a more equitable taxation structure that didn't disporportionately harm half the country. They didn't do that - instead, they held the position that the Confederacy *could not* secede, and that they were instead in open revolt.
It's popularly assumed that the war was started and prosecuted to end slavery; in fact, the Confederacy offered to pay for federal property in the South and was rejected. Lincoln ordered the commanders of Fort Sumter and other Union-held installations in the South not to surrender, but to hold until attacked.
Ft. Sumter was attacked by the South in April 1861, after having warned the troops holding it that they were about to be shelled. It fell in two days, with no loss of life. Lincoln used this as a rallying cry to more aggressively pursue a war to keep the Union together.
It's interesting to note that no slaves were freed until the Emancipation Proclamation came into effect on Jan 1, 1863  - 20 months after the war began.
The Civil War was about slavery for most of the state governments in the South. It was about economics and power for the North.
It was brought on by cultural and economic issues, and the participants on both sides largely saw the opposing forces as invaders and were in their eyes fighting to preserve the integrity of their homeland.

Levying a tax that can only be paid in a currency that was not possessed by those being taxed was the cause of the first armed rebellion in the United States.
Settlers on the Western frontier distilled whiskey for their own use and for barter. A tax was levied on whiskey that was only payable in greenbacks, which the settlers didn't have, nor did they have access to them.
Thus, the Whiskey Rebellion was born.
