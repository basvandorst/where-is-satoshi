@_date: 2018-01-23 15:17:22
but seriously, was there anyone on this forum, who bought in, when it went above 15k?  
  
just n00bs went crazy...  
  
everyone was seeing the charts and media went crazy to know what will happen.  
  
its time to buy in slowly in feb/march, after hitting 6k or 8k or 10k... who knows exactly....

dude, its a scala implementation of lightning network, ok?
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:09:47
I dont even think it went up to $19k longer then some few days to mark insanity, so everyone is seeing it.  
  
the next bitcoinhalving will be interesting indeed to see some 20k levels back

empty fast blocks goes like, you take one tx, which is fitting the last block, use asicboost (reusing hashes) and you get a valid block in less then 30 seconds.

LN tx will cost 5 cents again. but for that we need to stretch the blocks. If 8 mb blocks are working, lets do it, after LN.  
  
someone who can spend $5 for a transaction is having the money to run a node on fast internet. thats bitcoin then. But LN first

well, fear should not be stronger then development.  
  
but yeah, that was also always my argument
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:25:58
I think its important to keep the discussion alive, before myths are spreading out. And the second thing is, that there is a huge support from the community for the 2MB fork, otherwise BCH would not be so strong.  
  
I am also sick of losing comrades, turning to the other side. I sure we can be all in out boat, maybe sitting on opposite sides, but on the same chain and fork.
Splitting communities creates always a big damage p.e. Catholics and  Protestants or Shiits and Sunnis.

@_date: 2017-11-12 11:40:51
i think there is no more demand. thx costs about $1-5 dollar a tx on the blockchain should be ok. with lightning the costs will go down to pennies

i think they list bitcoin core for bitcore.  
  
  
  
otherwise cant explain that either...?

@_date: 2018-03-23 10:42:28
its an altcoin using btc blockchain for some services. so its not relevant for bitcoin in first place. btc itself can run native simple smart contracts, what enough for now.  
  
rsk has bitmain support, which is running hidden asic booster, mining empty blocks, stalling btc development.  
  
i would never touch anything from this liars.

the question is, can we have a BIP which is enforcing miners to include tx with a certain fee like 50 satoshi/kb?  
  
So less spam tx will be included into the chain, but the tx price will drop significantly, instead of not using the space in the blocks?
  
How to get rid off miners which are not just driven by the fee of tx, but also altruistic to support low fee tx?
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:41:28
its a correction, could stop at 3100 or smthng
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:15:08
I think too. Give the power to the users, instead to continue the war of developers and playing their game of power.  
  
i think there will be a time people will understand that and not follow just the best coders, but will also seek for diplomacy and peace.  
  
war is always destroying. everyone will lose at the end. we are in europe now almost 80 years free of wars. its not easy, we fight, we strugle, but we want peace and therefor we compromise and protect our values at the same time. its possible.
@_date: 2017-09-29 10:53:36
ok, i see the reactions are here today quite aggressive.  
  
i see the problem that alot people are seeing the 2x as not necessary upgrade, but other upgrades without a hard fork will come for sure.  
  
didnt want to hurt peoples feeling here
@_date: 2017-09-22 22:26:42
there is the question, if upgrading the bitcoin with 80% of hashrate is a new fork or not. So I guess, lets just find it out, what is going to happen with the other chain.
  
for me its a no brainer to follow the hashrate in this case. but for some its a no brainer to follow the developer they like. So its open-source software.  
  
i really do hope not to hurt any feelings here.  
  
good luck!
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:21:00
its open source software. you cant fire or keep developers. you can just decide what to merge into project. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:10:45
at the end of the day we will see that there is no way to stop bitcoin from upgrading.  
  
this will be good for bitcoin.  
  
some people call segwit2x an necessary upgrade, some are saying its not satoshis vision, but i really dont need to discuss that. its just politics, who of the developers is having the most power. IMO give the power back to the user, like in a real democrasy and not in the hands of technocrats. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:50:25
83% of mining network are supporting the hardfork. It will interesting to see the abandoned network surviving.  
  
i do hope the bitcoin war is over then :-)

I hope you spent all days listening to Tone Vays, Richard Heart when they said it will go from 20k to 16k, 8k, 6k.

ripple is a centralized system, similar to a protocol like html with the feature that you have to pay if you want to communicate in the network.
its very good and working for banks. some of them are using it for txs. it can save up to some % if you use fiat currencies and some % more if you use xrps.
thats the deal. 
i like it, but its very controversial. the question is, if it belongs to crypto currencies? yes, its using hashes, so its legit.

Matus Lestan, co-founder of the ethereum app Ethlance, for example, recently posted a screenshot of a user looking to create a user profile on the platform – an action that cost 0.08 ETH, or $7. It would have cost "little more than $1" when ether was at $10, he wrote.
high costs are a privilage, i think. 
i also think, i might be wrong, there are several possibilities to bring the fees down by factor 1000. its technology baby. :-)
@_date: 2017-07-06 09:31:11
just a question: bitcoin is having a public ledger. tx are not anonymous. i thought that is the magic behind btc blockchain. So tx can be used transparent, what makes its beauty?

ltc got 99% before activation of segwit. btc can do that too, once there is consensus.
@_date: 2017-07-05 06:57:05
there will be a coinsplit after the hardfork. there will be segwit2mb coin and the bitcoin unlimited . And i am putting my hand in fire, that bu will erase the blocksize limit. Just the value of the coin is the question, it could be $200, the current price on bitfinex. that would make a marketcap of 3.5 bn, not bad.

Lightning Network, the 2nd layer for BTC have been in production since 2013, the blocksize have been enlarged from 100kb to 1000kb.
SegWit went into development 2015. First coins implemented it June 2017. BTC will follow until end of year.
These are just facts. There are so many things more to be developed and its all about discussion, whats take time.
Because talking is democracy and finding compromises, its the best option, we human have, and it will be defeated for great human kind solutions. I live in Europe and we live this every day. Not saying, we have the best solutions everyday, its a work in progress for the next decade not for tomorrow. Because you can destroy very fast alot.
"Meanwhile Bitcoin still can't solve any scaling issues lol" is a phrase to bulli btc. Typical for r/btc or r/ethtrader and got 3 upvotes!
I am holding ETH and BTC and feel that idiocracy is getting stronger, but not going to change my principles.
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:22:04
man you speak out what alot of people are thinking.
we dont want war, we want just bitcoin back on dev track
* but for that we need to make a decision. Do we want a blockchain for the people or for businesses working on it? 
thats the main point in this discussion. it seems bitcoin cant be both. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:48:25

bitcoin hitted 2350, almost 2200. now we will see if its going up or more down. nice profits anyway
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:15:28
and we hitted again the middle line in the green channel. lets see if it goes down, more buying, if it goes up, making some profit
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:25:12
yeah, or short until the dip and go then long. 
finding a dip with +/- 10 % is a good one. so first entry could be buying in on 2640, 2400, 2200.
staying out of the market during high volatility can be a bigger gain by trading less. 
buy the dip worked for the last 6 months if you look at the chart. all altcoin markets too.
stockmarkets went down today, the same with bitcoin. There is some money in btc from hedge funds, lets see how it goes more up.
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:23:48
so lets do it. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:58:33
sounds reasonable. but he is having a history already. cant do it
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:47:03
dont fall on this trap guys. gbminers have been blocking segwit for almost 6 months now.
the only thing we can make is  and algo change to get rid off all the miners stopping bitcoin on scaling. they want high fees, i say we just dismiss them.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:15:05
its coming. nothing can stop it, neither jihanWu 
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:58:56
for how much?
@_date: 2017-06-27 07:43:57
I am sure we will more tx on the chain at the end of the year.
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:02:55
look here
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:14:36
soft fork is the only option, what ever it is. Every Hard Fork is going to split the chain now. 
First segwit and LN.
Then algo change or other solution, so miners can never taking BTC as hostage .  Because it seems that there are like 70% concentration of miners controll by one group.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:03:19
not if you dont care or paid by him
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:05:55
bitcoin is not going that way. it should be always an open ledger and not closed for anonymous parties. 
there are plenty of this discussions.
@_date: 2017-06-22 05:56:57
then tell me you genius, how can i pay my coffe with a block coming every 10 minutes?
so i guess that goes just off-chain on a 2nd layer, what is in development since 2013
