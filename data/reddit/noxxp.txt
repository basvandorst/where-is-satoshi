Do Banks, payment networks and their buildings and employees use less energy? How many employees need the current system?
A car is worse for the ecosystem than a horse. But if we had the horses to replace the current transport industry, the ecological impact would be greater.

The conspiracy you’re talking about is unlikely and very expensive to implement. As I said: it’s not impossible, it’s unlikely.
Sorry about my English, I meant that the price has risen over the past 10 years. I’m not talking about the future. We only “walk backwards” in life: We only can see the past. :-)

There’s a lot of fools out there. But this is not ONLY for cool, intelligent and educated people like you. This is to free us all, like the internet did in some aspects.

I’m new in this space, but I think that a 51% attack is an organized/on purpose action. This is independent of miners leaving their work.
The probability of a 51% attack in bitcoin is not 0%, but it is the lowest in the whole space at the moment, in my opinion.
If the price drops and miners leave, the difficulty decreases and each miner will end with bigger chances of BTC reward (more BTC for each miner).
Also for me is quite funny to read about “the price drop of BTC”... This sentence is only valid if you’re exclusively considering the price development of the last (maybe) 18 months. The price (AND THE FUNDAMENTALS/VALUE) of BTC is growing up in this 10 years.
The opposite happened with the shares of many financial institutions, but most the people still trust their wealth to those firms without questioning...

In my opinion they ARE ACCEPTING CRYPTO! Although in a very “conservative” manner...
How many people holding crypto manage their own keys? How many choose a decentralized way at the moment? Same is with retail, I think.
In my opinion counts! It’s not what it should be, but I understand the development... You can only use your BTC if your peers accept them.
You are right and this is not meant for keeping things centralized. But in my opinion, without a collapse of the actual system, things will develop gradually... I think this help people that don’t NEED crypto right now (like me, and maybe you also) to get in contact with this new “thing” (philosophy, political view, UX, technology, etc) and to learn and loose fear, before the banks come with a “confusing” and “easy to use” version of a (exclusive, censored and “trust” based) pseudo BTC.

In my opinion IT IS ADOPTION! Although a conservative, early one...

Yes. Why?

It seems that Mr. Wonderful had a slightly different opinion about bitcoin a couple of years ago... (April 2013) What happened? What changed fundamentally on bitcoin??? (sarcasm)

Exactly! But he said almost the opposite on tv a few days ago in an interview with Pompliano on CNBC! (

It is maybe safer for them... YOUR KEYS, YOUR BITCOIN. NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR BITCOIN.

Your key(s), your BTC. Not your key(s), not your BTC. Here’s why:

He probably shouldn’t have created a BANK if he doesn’t have the ability to “print” BTC...
