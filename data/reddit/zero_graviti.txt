More like dark side of the ��?
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:46:29
Yes.... the 24 hour window is the metric I was looking at since that is the publically available info.. I will try accelr/waiting before I look at RBF or CPFP alternatives... Thanks.

Yes. I used a Y-splitter. But I needed to make sure that the *fstab* entry allowed for /dev/sda1 to be ready when the os on the sd card needed to mount it :) I am currently at block # 330311 ....

I chose not to since my intent was not an innuendo but a gentle/friendly reminder.... I cant speak for AA or others, but can only keep my fingers crossed.

Close your eyes is as "auto" as it gets :D

I setup mine on a rpi with an external hdd... without pruning it seemed to get into some problems (Log messages on debug.log with '*Rolling forward......*' which was taking way too much time to restore back to the point in time when the disk/network failure/partition happened) ... I have since added a flag for '**-prune=550**' and the node seems to be more resilient to network failures and can be tracked on bitnodes [ ... will make an op later today and possibly a write up since there were some challenges along the way wrt the setup... but nothing which can’t be solved...
Here is my rpi info:
    Linux raspberrypi 4.9.35+  Fri Jun 30 14:34:49 BST 2017 armv6l GNU/Linux
This is the link I used to setup my hdd to my ancient rpi -&gt;  (my external hdd is not powered so i have to figure out a way to power it since the rpi had insufficient power to run this hdd)
The *fdisk* step is what got me stuck a little -&gt;  (take the rsync instructions from the first link (above) *not* this one). **mkfs.ext4** is important here....
Let me know if I need to *steemit* or *wordpress* this or just create a gist on github (I am thinking a gist wd do...)
Good work dude !

Have they taken the same stand for bitcoin cash as well and other cryptos or just bitcoin ?
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:13:05
Done (ie tx got confirmed via the accelr) ... perseverance pays... thanks for giving me hope :D
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:57:50
Someone whisper crypto into his ear.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:28:54
Agreed 100%.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:46:59
Have been trying this.... will try to time it to the x:00 instant :)... Thanks

On trading view add an indicator called ‘td sequential’
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:25:30
I would like to think of it as one of my destinations and enjoy the journey ��
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:22:43
Might be there is an opportunity to decentralize it ? Are all the asic miners in China or we have hardware specs which would allow for fair global production of mining equipment?
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:50:00
Can you share the link for this recantation ? I couldnt find one myself, and no I am not a BB shill unless you chose to think so.... Thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:24:00
Follow whalecalls on Twitter and you might be able to form an informed opinion ... ��

Fix bitcoin first !!
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:17:36
Thats so true esp. for the tx fees with comparable volumes between BTC and BCH....
ETH tx volumes are awesome though :)
Nice share....

Whale call ?

Thats rough :D

Good job !

Keep calm and hodl.

Haven’t been able to wrap my head around why would I want to use a payment channel.

There is no *** in *** fighting... Just shitty forked coin beliebers trolling and posing...
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:59:49

And its just starting.... :) Watch it go down the tubes...

Nice to see the benign usage of the aquatic species ��
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:27:13
The **transaction fee** pin has the potential to either burst or make the bitcoin bubble stronger (if code impl upgrades are operationalized).... IMHO
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:53:02
What kind of algorithms is this quantum computer most efficient in ? Do we have any public available perf benchmarks which can be verified ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:39:36
I do agree
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:31:13
Should we have a hackathon ?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:21:11
Actually the tx fees has gone down from around $10 mio to $7.5 mio looking at charts for Dec 17 and Dec 18 on fork.lol ....

There are 2 segwits - that which got implemented and that which was called off in Nov this year ie segwit2x. 
From an adoption viewpoint - segwit or lets say s1x hasnt happened widely across ATMs, Merchants, Wallets, Exchanges etc...

TradingView is kewl too.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:21:19
Gotta be the whales.... they are the real market movers. You and me and the rest are but minions clamoring abt prices .... sad but true.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:29:08
Bisque seems promising.. give it a twirl and let us know. I am not a big fan of desktop wallets. It’s sposed to be a decentralized exchange ie no middleman.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:38:27
Use BCH for micropayments ....
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:34:20
Right.... we are still in a price discovery phase.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:47:26
Let’s have a look at the code or at least ‘in action’. Github is your friend ...
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:37:21
1) Double spend fix......
2) spv protection/insulation from large blocks
3) Explore LN with/out s2x (ie with s1x)
4) Bloomfilter optimization/rationalization for non full nodes
5) AI based blocksize determination (just saying....)
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:48:47
Shorting the market hurts if you are not a whale... or might be even if you are. Who knows ?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:11:11
Not even this gimmick will rescue yahoo !!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:30
Run to the hills....or stay calm and hodl. :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:41:53
You will need to read up on that. Start with understanding what was the path taken to segwit and all the implemented BIPS. Understand why segwit 2x didn’t hit the road. And observe what’s going in with DARI.
Fun fact: simple questions usually don’t have a simple answer in the bitcoin world ... ��
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:31
Decentralization to the fore !! Onward ....
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:00:26
+1 for bitflyer. Their bitflyerfx has some cool charting widgets too. Support is responsive sometimes even on weekends !
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:58:29
Has anyone tried buying �� with a bitcoin ?

Defo some insider information which was not public knowledge.... The timing was impeccable and too much of a coincidence...
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:43:01
I think it’s big from a retail adoption perspective ie here come the words ....  ‘a medium of exchange’
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:43:33
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:53:10
I guess we need to rechannelize that expended energy ... in our own individual manner. e.g., someone did try redirecting the heat generated from his mining rigs to heat his/their home during winter....

Where is bcash's codebase ... github or somewhere else ?

@_date: 2017-12-22 00:24:12
Some questions and answers seem to be out of sync... Each person having their own script to talk from. How far is LN integration into mainnet away (AFAIK m/n would need segwit first) ? 
The toy UI for "starblocks" was cute and slick though :)
