We also recently started to accept bitcoin at 1xrun.com -  we've got a large selection of limited edition prints and original art. In the spirit of the post, use code REDDITBTC10 for ten percent off your total order until Saturday!

you guys must clearly not want my business. I emailed you weeks ago since you hiked the withdrawal fees while i was in the midst of waiting for my btc to transfer out of the vault, so i was helpless to have to accept the new fees. buying back in shortly, but it won't be with coinbase, since your support has been godawful.

It would be great if you responded to mine as well. I don't want to have to clog reddit with another thread about this. Emailing now.

Much thanks! We've been debating creative ways to expand sales, and this is the hat that I threw into the ring :)

Thank you! I told the owners that we could have the money instantly cashed into dollars, split, or kept as bitcoin. They chose all bitcoin. I'm rubbing off on em ;)

Most definitely! From what I understand, our international rates are quite reasonable.

Sorry that I'd rather get a wealth of opinions from a variety of sources than to blindly trust the results of a google search. So much for community...

Ive been dipping my toes in the water and waiting for the right time to actually start collecting bitcoin. Is this that day?!

Though I can't say I know for sure, I think it was generally positive. I attribute it to his recent lack of faith in the US economy given his hilariously rabid hatred of Obama.

That's one thing I was curious about - after he said it, I figured he read it somewhere or something, because it seems like a fairly accessible thought to come up with. I'm curious if it ever popped up elsewhere from parallel thinking, I assume it did, but this instance was definitely born of his small grasp on the subject.

Trust me - I find the karma-whoring idea pretty retarded. Plus, with all the negative people in this thread, I can't see why anyone would WANT to personally make up a story about their family to see the internet call them/you fake/stupid. I live a pretty full life and seeking validation from reddit seems laughable from where I'm standing. I just thought it fit a unique niche of a life experience that people here would enjoy reading about. Very mixed results on that...

As in, you don't believe me? If I were to make something up, please trust that I'd shoot for something a little more thrilling than my stepdad talking about bitcoin.
