how does a noob start developing for OB or other bitcoin applications? I'm reading andreas antonopoulos book. Am i on the right track?

it is still in beta... so installing requires some command line work. But you just have to follow the steps to install it, It is not difficult just following the recipe. In the future i'm sure it will be simpler but right now is what it takes

I've been interested in bitcoin for more than a year, I saw the 1k peak and bought a small amount at peak. I'm not worried about what I bought at 1k and now is 300 (keep in mind I spent very few dollars, was what i could afford). My thinking process is: 
"Is this technology going to be mainstream?" I think yes.
If so, there is no way (in my mind i'm no economist) that it will be at 100 per BTC it will be much higher. So I'm keeping the small amount I have until it goes mainstream, then I will trade the bits I have for products and not for fiat. Meanwhile I'll try to get some more, so it is a good sign for me that it is falling, it gives me some time to get more while it is cheap. I could be wrong, but i'm not.

I think microsoft acceptance was the last drop, bitcoin is becoming mainstream, I hope so, and hope to get more before it happens
@_date: 2014-12-23 18:20:48
never heard of that

The dogecar is good for bitcoin. People who will search for dogecoin will stumble upon bitcoin for sure. The fact that dogecoin is fun will attract people to de crypto currencies, where bitcoin is king. So bit coiners should also celebrate that dogecoin got that kind of attention.

want to install and check it out follow [this instructions]( It is still not completely straightforward to install, but if you follow the instructions you can check it out for yourself. Don't worry about the github repository, as a normal user you don't need to know what that is 
Edit: 


You have to install something in your computer so you can access the website

I don't know why people are down voting you, you have some really good points. Bitcoin needs a service where you can buy 5$ worth of bitcoin with paypal for example. 
In this sub it seems that the term tech savvy only refers to programmers and whatnot. There are various levels of tech awareness, and people interested in bitcoin are generally more tech savvy than the majority of internet users.
Bitcoin needs to get to anyone, and most people won't leave their homes just to get some bitcoin from a stranger. That's why I buy most of my stuff from the internet, because I don't want to leave my chair.

how would you make transactions? (serious question I would like to know more about this)
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:31:11
could't you put anything on the online computer so it installs a program on the usb to copy the private keys on the offline computer?
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:24:16
Thank god i've been interested in bitcoin. it's like game of thrones but with nerds

and yet again people downvoting because something is critical of bitcoin. Of course there is a problem with this, not being able to fix your mistakes is a flaw in a system that is intended to be used by humans.
you can introduce a 3rd party to correct the mistakes, but then you have to trust the 3rd party. I think this will eventually happen.
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:20:17
Thanks for spreading. You are a really good tipper
