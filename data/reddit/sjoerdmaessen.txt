If you 'monitor' the operator and see something fishy you are already to late. What Romanizer said, it takes only 1 operator at the top. But off course there is also a change of external people that can take control of Ghash.io etc

Nope, didn't use it in a public place, I'm 100% sure I only used it on CEX. For each service etc I have a different e-mailadress and I don't mix them with public addresses.
I will, thank you!

A small update, I asked three merchants so far if they did accept Bitcoin (which they didn't). Next to that I've wrote a small article on my blog how people can receive Bitcoin donations ( I do think that Bitcoin would get a giant boost if large charity organizations start accepting Bitcoin.

The purpose of the test wasn't using Bitcoin for illegal activities but checking the airport security and improve that in the near future. Bitcoin was just a way to make a transaction. It has nothing to do with banning Bitcoin in The Netherlands... (ps I'm Dutch)

Thank you for all the responses so far. Asking if a merchant accepts BTC with every buy I do seems to be a good idea! But I will need to buy a lot of stuff, or more practical, alot of people will need to do the same, before we reach every merchant.
Joining a project like coinagecrypt.com is always possible but (no offense) there are a lot of these kind of initiatives.
Building a BitPay PSP plugin is one to remember! But I do think they will have some dedicated developers available that are already working on it.
One thing I noticed while talking with people about getting started with Bitcoin is they have difficulty starting. Which wallet to chose, why is there sometimes a fee and how much is the fee, what should I do with my private key,... 'ordinary' people still have a lot of problems starting with Bitcoin. What about a website where you can buy Bitcoins but you will get them as a file download. This file then contains a wallet with the BTC that someone bought. This way people that are new get a wallet and are ready to start right away. Do you guys think it's still to difficult to get started for new people?
