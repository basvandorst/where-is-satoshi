I love it when people think they get to dictate what is acceptable to other people. 
These people don't understand the game.

Youre asking for support regarding a product you ordered on Reddit... Not trying to point out the obvious but you're asking in the wrong place.

I've heard people complain about chase but I use them and have never experienced any issues purchasing Bitcoin

The people in financial systems are the ones who stand to lose out because not just Bitcoin, but all crypto is outside of what they deal with. 
There's a wildness to it that they can't and will never understand. That's fear to them. 
People who refuse to open their mind to it cannot be forced. They have to come to terms with it on their own. Keep doing what you do and if the person in question has a genuine interest they will come to you when they're ready. 
And you can glibly remind them of how much they lost out on by waiting.

Bitcoin didn't ruin your family. 
Greed ruined your family. 
Identify the real source before placing blame.

They obviously forgot the part where you have to capture it in a pokeball. Sometimes they escape and you have to throw more money at it to ease it into the pokeball.

Even given valid points of contention to provide a reasonable faith in Bitcoin your response multiple times is "given the recent fork it seems risky" 
If you aren't looking to accept reason to buy into Bitcoin then don't ask. You appear to have your mind set, because you're 50 means nothing. 
You either want to get Bitcoin or you don't. 
I wouldn't try to sell you on it, leave more for me to hodl.

I mean I'm all for Bitcoin. But your reasoning is really flawed. 
Instead of saying who has it states the benefits. Decentralization, blockchain, or world-wide currency. 
Who cares who holds Bitcoin? It's not mainstream... Currently, but wait until the technology can support it. You'll understand why Bitcoin is valuable then.
