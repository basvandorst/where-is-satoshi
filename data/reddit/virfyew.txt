Even if you're using 2FA it doesn't save your cookies from being intercepted.
So MITM is still able to login "beside you".
I think that this is critical, should be fixed asap, and all users should get e-mail from staff instructing them to change their password.

The password is definitely ~~leaked~~ exposed to your ISP's and government agencies [NSA]. ~~I agree with you, that word "leak" usually means "leaking database/api", but in this situation I think it's also correct. As far as "your information isn't as confidential as you think it is".~~
What do you think is a better word for describing this situation?
 I agree, expose is better.

Time-Lock Puzzle is a Digital Time Capsule. It is created in an instant and requires set amount of computations to unlock it.
The main difference is that it can only be solved by one thread/core, so you only need a fast one-core CPU to unlock it. Additional CPU's/GPU's won't make the process any faster. It means, that if you want to protect your BTC's for 7 years you'd cut on a power bill compared to multi-core solution [such as password brute-force proposed by It also means, that you couldn't "cheat" and get the keys faster by renting a datacenter.
So you could benchmark your CPU, create a Time-Lock Puzzle with a difficulty of 7 years, start computing, and 7 years from now you'd have your private key back. But because you'd need to write a solution by yourself I highly discourage it.

I logged in a few dozen times and transacted many BTC's before realizing it.
Once even did it on a bench in a park using an unencrypted, public Wifi.
I don't think that title is misleading.
Especially since most times when you hear about exchange leaks you hear that only hashes were leaked. This time it's plaintext passwords.
Most people aren't conscious enough to change protocol to https. It took me a few months.

13780$? 10 years?
Look at the historical trend. More like 10 months.

The fix is not the problem. Like I wrote in the article the fix is "5 lines in an apache.conf".
Administrators of the exchange are the problem, they don't understand why their approach is insecure.

IMO the best solution would be the [Time-Lock Puzzle](
It's created in a constant time and can be solved using only a single thread, which means that you'd need only a cheap CPU.
Unfortunately AFAIK nobody implemented it yet, so you'd have to code it by yourself.

In my workplace I've hidden several [over 100] paper wallets with small amounts on them. Some were easy to find, some won't be found until the furniture is moved.
A few tips:
* Keep the private keys. Some paper wallets *will* be lost or trashed. Keeping the private keys will allow you to reuse them later.
* Be sure to make a note "Withdraw before: 23.05.2015". If someone won't withdraw before this date, you can count the paper wallet as lost and make a new one.
* Make wallets from script if you plan on making more than 10.
* Import public keys to a separate wallet to keep track of progress. Preferably use blockchain.info, it allows people to send messages to you.

My tips:
* Install linux. There is a lot less malware on linux.
* Use separate browser for banking websites. For examples: For normal browsing use Chrome, for exchanges use Firefox.
* In your banking browser install only one extension: [HTTPS Everywhere](
As for me, I've transacted a lot of money through Bter. 95% it's a problem with your computer.

I scanned whole 0.0.0.0/0. I've found 4948322 ip addresses with port 49150 open. Considering that rodarmor's program is buggy, I don't think it's reasonable to scan for a real one.

You have a bug in your code that sometimes makes it crash:
    root ./main "Thank you Mario, but your Bitcoin is in another castle!" | tee puzzlelog.txt
    213.187.127.36:54806
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "./main", line 17, in &lt;module&gt;
	message = c.recv(4096)
    socket.error: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer
Also if someone connects to your port and doesn't disconnect, your server will hang for some time without accepting connections.

Yes, it works.
 - Here is a Defcon presentation about this particular program.

It's a VC funding bubble. Just like in 2000's when .com in name gave you 10* more funding.

Mycelium keeps keys on the phone. Even if every Mycelium server goes bust, you can still export the key to another wallet.

TwinWinNerD [CEO] is an old forum member [2011] with very long history of money-related services [lending, off-exchange currency exchange, escrow, ...]. It's not a scam.
