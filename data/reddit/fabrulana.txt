You know I have thought about it a lot. About who one should help when being a philanthropist. There is a lot of people helping the poor, animals, nature etc. But I think one issue that is overlooked is (like one of the comments stated in a joking manner) is to help hardworking people out of their endless debt spiral. One if the worst stress point in families are financial concerns and it occurs in a lot of hardworking families, and also the cause of many suicides. I know I went through a rough patch myself before and am currently trying to help a good friend through his. The thing is how to do this is an issue, as said people are usually too proud to accept assistance... with my friend it is obviously different.  I thought I can convince some of them into buying Bitcoin but then they can't afford buying any and will panic on dips. Just a thought. Maybe people smarter than me can figure out how to do this. Satoshi?

Aaand $13k done and dusted...

Why shouldn't it? People are still awakening and learning what it is. Unlike faith it is an actual existing disrupting technology, no faith required. As awareness grows so shall the "price" in whatever you want to try and evaluate it in.

Me too, only thing I regret I is that I could have bought more BTC now. But it is a good learning experience and it will be up next month again as we continue our journey to $50-$60k.

Just don't sell, it will go past that this month.

Bitcoin is a great way to cover our asses if things go pear-shaped. Venezuelans are experiencing this first hand.

Yeah, we are savvy...

Chances are really really bad (slim to zero) if you need the wallet.dat file, any installations to that drive like Windows and Recuva may have overwritten where the data was. Your only chance is if you have the private key.

Correct, the child key will be added to the content before the parent's private key of 256 bits gets generated. Something similar to that is explained clearly here:

I'm conflicted. One side of me says you are still young and to go for it and learn from mistakes. Other side says be careful. So yeah, I guess try and do both... be careful while taking risks lol...

Me too. Joined your channel ;)
@_date: 2019-10-11 05:19:22
I do it everywhere in social media, twitter, youtube, whatsapp etc.

What Satoshi came up with was a brilliant design... but it only works if all of the pegs function as intended. The only coin to have done this right so far is Bitcoin. Others are all centralized by design. Watch for example the series Startup and see how they are taken on by authorities. Bitcoin is the only one that can survive such a scenario so far. There are other factors like Schelling point etc. like another person said check out the Bitcoin Standard - I think Chapter 9 starts out on the the Bitcoin attributes if I remember correctly.

Very cool dude!

As someone who also really loved his dad and miss him, I can understand. I am glad Bitcoin created the opportunity for you to see your dad still one more time.

Get ready for 11,000... Now even the meme's can't keep up

Hey Peter !
@_date: 2019-01-22 10:24:48
Right with you Grandpa

Yes, go figure... I thought it would keep going down or stay low. Now it is rebounding before August. Obviously I still don't understand these currencies fully yet. Could be that the Bitcoin segwit signals are looking quite positive currently. Not sure... 
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:17:06
Don't worry about it, just keep it. It will come back when the whole August 1 thing blows over. Buy more if you can before Aug 1 at lower price. I think I have learned a lot from this. I bought as well before learning the current cryptocurrency environment. Won't make this mistake again, next time I will be prepared... Read the emotions of the market and act accordingly.
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:12:53
Same here... :) But riding this one out. Will buy on the 26th again when my salary comes in, hopefully the price will be low still. Selling would be silly now.

All the best to all for Xmas!

Only if you can carry the risk and realise you are speculating. I remember buying Bitcoin during the bull run in 2017. Using my credit card to buy at the beginning of month &amp; payback at end of month. A friend of mine called it credit card mining :)   It only bit me in December, and then I stopped. But I made a lot of profit until then, easily covering December's loss. I was even able to help a friend of mine that was in financial dire straits and still profit. Point is sometimes you got to take a chance, just  make sure you can cover the losses. Due to the global impact of Bitcoin it is very difficult to determine when it will be pumping or dumping.
