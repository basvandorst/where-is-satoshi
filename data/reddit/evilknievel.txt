Sorry for that, I will edit the OP.
Could you instruct me how to setup the "tipbot". I have looked for it as I have seen it before, but I had no luck obviously.

Well, the transaction was for a dollar to demonstrate the thing live on bitcointalk.
If any Gambling Site or Bitcoin Mixer would use the Blockchain API and accept Zero Confirmations you could easil (with a successrate of 100%) exploit the "bug" to gain profit.
A demo does not need be necessarily presented with 100000 Dollars, even if I would be willing (if I had that much) to do it .. and in this case you can get your money back surely.
Imagine you bet, the casino pays you out (or if you lose not), and you take your money back just to rebet ... do that in an infinite loop and you cannot lose.

Yes, the second one is confirmed. That is the successful double spent that Blockchain.info is not aware of.
In TX
I have sent 0.0049 BTC to some adress.
The output came from transaction
The very same output has been spent in the transaction you have lined from bitpay.com.
So the guy, who uses Blockchain.info API still thinks he has the money, while the money already switched owners already (as seen on bitpay.com)

It was not the dust output, it was a non standard "illegal" transaction in a long chain of constucted transactions.
This TX is invalid (though accepted by blockchain info).
Basically a 0 of 2 Multisig that was.

I have 680 BTC, but I am not sure how to put even a single coin into the "changetip" wallet. If you instruct me how to do that, I will tip you properly ;-)
Specially, I have no clue how to tell the changetip bot that you are the receiver of the 100000xxxx bits.
@_date: 2014-11-29 00:47:43
Well, the very same coins arrived at  some address in transaction
Not visible in other Explorers, but fully valid in all Blockchain.info wallets. Perfectly suitable for the zero confirmation attack.
@_date: 2014-11-29 01:06:50
Yes, I agree with you.
But gambling sites allowing 0-confirmation deposits (which are common) could be screwed then.
This transaction (0 of 2 multisig) should never ever be accepted by blockchain.info.

Thanks, I have a hard time explaining things sometimes,
I dont care about a dollar, once I find out how the tipping bot works I will tip you properly :-)
Yes, the big deal is the 0 of 2 Multisig 
that is recognized as a valid transaction by blockchain.info
@_date: 2014-11-29 01:23:48
Well I have to say sorry for explaining it so badly.

The Bounty just vanished from the escrow address?
Is this bounty still ongoing? Many people started working on this.
@_date: 2014-05-18 19:40:29
Hi Oliver,
thanks for this interesting bounty! I totally agree in all your points. However, there is a slight problem that I see: 
It is not enough to create a wonderful democracy platform, with bazillions of nice features, when the core developers still work hand in hand with the foundation. This would result in the activity on this platform being completely independent of what actually happens with the bitcoin client/source.
I will make some brainstorming, because unless we get this fixed, all work is for nothing.

Check out this:
The double spend warning also appears AFTER the double spend, before it goes underneith the radar.
@_date: 2014-11-29 01:09:23
For the record:
0 of 2 multisig is here:

This is the problem with Zero Confirmations. A gambling site which allows 0-confirmations would allow this TX as a bet.
If you win, you push the transaction chain I created to eligius and get it confirmed, if now you do the same doublespent shown in this demo.
So you basically double spend the losses, and many many casinos allow 0-conf bets ... hopefully they aint using blockchain.info wallets.
Yes, it never happened, but in bockchain.info it appears, even if you query your wallet using their API.
@_date: 2014-11-29 01:01:07
If you want I can send you an arbitrary amount of BTC to your blockchain wallet which you can send around to other blockchain wallets i any way you want .. NONE of that will happen of the real blockchain however, ...
wanna try?
@_date: 2014-11-29 00:31:07








Let me try to tip you back:
10000 bits @_date: 2014-11-29 00:18:04
Nope, I am talking about the 0.00479999 BTC transactiion sent to
and then taken away from him 10 hours later.
@_date: 2014-11-29 01:09:09
0 of 2 multisig is here:

lol, doesn't work
