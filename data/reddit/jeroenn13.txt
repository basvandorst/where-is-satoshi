Completely incorrect

Seems legit.

The master protocol is perfect for this.
March 15, launch of the distributed exchange

@_date: 2014-11-22 20:49:43
Remember 99% of these topics are members trying to get tips.
@_date: 2014-06-21 00:25:37
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-07-15 16:06:21
Lol this.
@_date: 2014-05-11 18:18:05
Just like Mastercoin but without any dev bounty or fundraise?
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:31:53
But China did not ban Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-18 23:32:14
You realize there are RATS available for mobile devices?

You should check 
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:12:25
It is, you should take a look at Mastercoin and decide :)
@_date: 2014-05-12 15:10:21
This project will stop soon.
Again, No fundraise. No money.
@_date: 2014-11-22 20:54:30
Ok thats cool :) Congratz on your tips
@_date: 2014-06-02 14:39:56
Reddit manipulation aswell.
Why would anyone at /Bitcoin upvote this message?
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:50:03
Divers license :)
@_date: 2014-08-16 22:14:14
Not yet.
Is coming in the next releases.
@_date: 2014-05-15 01:04:18
For Mastercoin I recommend to post this question here:
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:16:23
"This Could Be the End of Bitcoin"
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:17:08
Reminds me of:
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:28:21
Mastercoin also have a block explorer: 
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:20:55
If you simple check the upvotes you know there is something shady going on here.
Why would anyone in the r/Bitcoin upvote this message?
We all know it's fake and/or a way to manipulate the market.
@_date: 2014-04-25 14:59:36
Crowdfunding on Master Protocol?
Just like MaidSafe?
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:29:08
Proof of burn?
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:02:38
This is actually good news!
@_date: 2014-05-25 23:01:01
Good news!

I was interested in this until I saw the shipping to EU is 40$.
Are there other options available for this?

Its not magic, nxt is using it's own blockchain to process payments.
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:14:59
Seems legit.
@_date: 2014-06-22 18:32:38
Don't ask for donations.
@_date: 2014-04-09 13:03:29
I also love the Master Protocol

@_date: 2014-11-21 19:04:36
Maidsafe exchanges
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:06:12
The Master Protocol.
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:14:16
China 3.0
@_date: 2014-02-15 16:43:52
Huge difference:
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:56:14
IMO you will never be able to output to Fiat in a decentralised exchange.

**Post a NON-Refferal link!**
@_date: 2014-07-19 00:23:15
1. Start looking for someone who has an "Excellent reputation" and ask him/her to start the fund.
2. Wait for donations.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:23:38
Great idea.
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:18:52
Actually they did release some features.
It's all about the final product.
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:31:15
Aaaand it's gone.
@_date: 2014-04-15 17:53:44

You ment 17000 safecoins right? Look at Safecoin.io
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:19:32
Counterparty is a copy of Mastercoin, not even a competitor.

I will wait until someone comes with the exact same idea but without monthly fees.
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:41:49
Just don't.
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:39:44
Are you the same guys as buymastercoin.com?
@_date: 2014-04-07 10:09:34
@_date: 2014-05-10 21:15:06
This is BuyMaid.com,
We recently updated our MaidSafecoin prices.
You can still buy them from our website, ready to deliver.
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:54:32
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-08-20 22:39:33
Scammers will always be scammers.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:39:38
Atleast they we're the first with their product/service.
@_date: 2014-05-15 09:06:22
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-04-29 21:37:18

There are 2 "Trusted" exchanges:
* 
* 
When the SAFE network goes live, owners of Maidsafecoin can redeem SAFECOIN (Used in the SAFE network) by sending Maidsafecoin to a burn address.
Network : SAFE Network
* Network : SAFE Network
* Coin: Maidsafecoin (Before launch)
* Coin: SAFECOIN (After network launch)

Really. These guys are begging for tips.
@_date: 2014-04-12 12:31:59
Do not download.
@_date: 2014-09-08 01:10:35
So what does that mean?
Go up or down?
@_date: 2014-04-29 16:41:51
OK. Any news?
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:55:29
No, maintenance.
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:26:11
I recommend using 
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:47:25
Use of the Master Protocol?
@_date: 2014-05-16 22:12:06
Openscam, are you serious?

Where is your source about 50% ?
@_date: 2014-06-09 19:16:00
Maybe we should not and just wait until they are forced to do so? Ebay/PayPal are accepting it soon.
We shouldn't beg for it.
@_date: 2014-04-25 23:28:41
Oh damn. I feel sorry for people investing in your company.
You are completely misinformed. 
What did the Master Protocol copy?
One more thing, watch the coinsummit video.

The developer is a scammer. Please check Bitcointalk about this script. Do not use.
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:06:25
Ok but Master Protocol released the asset exchange 5 days ago.
Have you seen what happened with MaidSafe?
Good luck anyways.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:29:57
You added transaction fees?
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:39:42
Read the Master Protocol specification here:
Very interesting.
@_date: 2014-06-02 14:05:59
Why can't we just ban every "China" title or post at /Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2014-03-26 16:36:06
There must be a reason for them to use it.

Expect what happens when they lose all their coins?
They are not able to pay you back. Even with 40-50% lost coins you cannot be sure.
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:16:05
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:03:59
I will test it soon!
Thank you prophetx!
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:01:24
There is a webwallet which doesn't need these requirements.
Mastercoin is a great project.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:57:03
Poloniex have been hacked before. New design doesn't change the security.

To cover your losses.

Mastercoin is way better compared to this.
