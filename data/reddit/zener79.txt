Ok, so BitPay will need to have as much liquidity to supply all the channel it has with end users, right? Unless it does an on-chain tx for each user that has enough balance that worth the cost of the "withdrawal".
This will be needed to "recharge" the channel it has with the Exchange.
It doesn't seems to be able to scale to me. It is  a completely different business model and risk management for BitPay...

It seems that is not even fully implemented/released in the official Core client yet!
I just asked here:
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:52:02
Let's keep it simple: let assume I install the last stable production-ready release, the 0.15.1 as for the .org website;
if I fire the "getnewaddress" RPC call, am I going to get a segwit address or not?
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:27:29
The problem is that it seems that is not even fully implemented/released in the official Core client yet!
I just asked here: 
So what is all this FUD about???
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:52:56
So, please, what is all this FUD about the poor adoption? I'm going mad!
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:29:24
And does this solve the problem?
I mean:
1. I open a channel with BitPay and pay a BigMac. 
2. BitPay give USD to McDonald.
3. BitPay has a channel with gdax.
Can BitPay move the fund from the channel I have with it to the channel it has with gdax without an on-chain tx?

You comment is just wasted space as it doesn't add anything to the thread.
I never talked about GUI as I don't care about it. I just asked a simple question: is Segwit already implemented and released as stable in Bitcoin-Core? Does the native getnewaddress RPC call produce a segwit address on 0.15.1?
As you did not contributed at all but only "wasted space," I'll do:
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:14:24
Ok, at the end I found the answer somewhere else: even if it is no documented on the wiki ( there is a new experimental RPC call that is there from 0.13 that is *addwitnessaddress*. Addresses beginning with a 3 generated using *addwitnessaddress* are called P2SH-P2WPKH addresses. That means it is a Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH) script embedded in a Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) address.
You must use it like this:
    bitcoin-cli addwitnessaddress 1BRo7qrYHMPrzdBDzfjmzteBdYAyTMXW75
So far I don't know how stable and production-ready is. Probably when 0.16 will be released with default Segwit support, people will use it more confidently.

This is weird. If your Amazfit Tools setup looks exactly the same as the following picture, it could be a permission issue related to your phone model
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:47:50
To achieve this you just need an Amazfit Bip, an Android phone and the following apps:
Tasker: [
Tools &amp; Amazfit; [
Unfortunately you have to pay few bucks for these apps, but if you have some money invested in crypto, you probably are going to have a lambo on the next few years, so this is not a problem, right?
1) Open the Amazfit Tools app
2) Go to the "Button" section on the left sidebar
3) Click on + to add an action
4) Click on "More" and on "Send Broadcast (Intent)"
5) Click on "Intent Action", write "bit\_tap" and confirm
6) Download this Tasker XML configuration file:
7) Open the Tasker app
8) Long press the "PROFILE" tab and choose "Import"
9) Choose the XML file you just downloaded on point 6
10) Double press your Amazfit Bip button and wait few seconds
11) Enjoy :-)
You can easily add/remove ctypto and/or change the ticker source (currently Bitstamp) editing the Tasker Task.
This setup is very similar to the one I posted for the Xiaomi MiBand2:
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:53:20
It strictly depends on your network speed. I'm on holiday, and my connection sucks :-)
Also removing cryptos from Tasker will speed up things, as it will need to fire a GET request for every pair to fetch the value.
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:11:18
Did you imported the Tasker XML? If you open tasker, do you see the "BtcPrice" task?
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:35:01
You don't need root privileges. 
Did you correctly set the bit_tap Intent Action on Amazfit Tools as described in points 1 to 5 of the tutorial?
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:23:38
I took the same screenshot :-)
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:26:17
In your screenshot (Tasker: event -&gt; system -&gt; intent received) I see you wrote "mb2=tap2" instead of "mb2_tap2".
Try to fix it and le me know
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:55:14
Same thing I thought :-)
I'll keep a copy of the privkey for her on my cold storage. You never know...
@_date: 2017-04-18 06:24:33
No, just a regular P2PKH address
@_date: 2017-04-18 18:44:48
Of course is only the public address. To reveal the private key you have to break the seal.
@_date: 2017-04-17 20:24:00
You are a really good theacher!
An HD seed would be a clever way to give btc, but for long term holder I think a plain paper wallet with the privkey printed on the back is a better choice
@_date: 2017-04-18 00:03:51
Yes, but you have to use a bip32/bip44 perfectly compatible wallet. Will you find it in  2027?
Probably you will be always able to git checkout  the source code of a compatible wallet, revert back to a 10 years old commit and rebuild your wallet... But I like to keep things simple
@_date: 2017-04-17 20:40:40
Yes, that's great, but if you put the 12 mycelium words in your safe box for 10 years, are you really confident that restore your wallet will be simple as is now? we do not know how long Bitcoin will last, but I think it will do more than mycelium
Anyway, congrats for your initiative!

You can have a multisig address 2of2. Keep a key for you and give the other to the parents.
Then sign a transaction  (without broadcasting it) with both keys and the nLockTime in 18 years from now that move funds in a regular P2PKH address
Give the parents also the signed transaction and the privkey of the P2PKH address.
In this way once the CLTV expires they can broadcast the signed transaction and take control of the funds without your agreement

if your wife is complaining about you always staring at your smartphone checking the BTC price, now you can make her happy, and look at your $15 fitness tracker instead.
You just need a Xiaomi MiBand2, an Android phone and the following apps:
Unfortunately you have to pay few bucks for these apps, but if you have some money invested in BTC, you probably are going to have a lambo on the next few years, so this is not a problem, right?
Open the "Mi Band 2 Func" app and set the values as shown on the following image:
Than open Tasker and follow these steps:
Create a new profile: event -&gt; system -&gt; intent received: action=mb2_tap2 
(press back button to save and exit)
Add a new task (and give a name like "btc price" if you want)
Add an action: Net -&gt; HTTP get: ServerPort=
 (press back)
Add an action: Code -&gt; JavaScriptlet: Code=var jsonData = JSON.parse(global('HTTPD')); var price = jsonData.last; setGlobal('%BtcPrice', price);  
(press back)
Add an action: Plugin -&gt; Mi Band Tools -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Custom pattern(enabled): VT(9, %BtcPrice) 
(press ok and four times back)
Enjoy :-)
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:10:36
What is the problem?
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:02:09
Actually I don't think there is an easy way to do what you asked for. All the information MiBand2 shows/rotate are from its internal sensors, and are fully working with or without phone/bluetooth/internet connection.
BTC price must be fetched from web and there must be an "event" to be triggered for it to be displayed.
In my setup the double-tap trigger a Tasker event on your phone. Tasker fetch the BTC price and send it back through the MiBandTool plugin to the MiBand2.
As for the flakey tap of "miband2func" is not so bad once you are use to it :-)
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:44:12
not indeed. In fact, maybe your OCD might get even worse with this thing always on your wrist :-)
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:42:43
You have errors in all the three steps :-)
Step1 is https instead of http
Step2 you have to remove "Code="
Step3 is all wrong
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:47:30
If it shows the bitcoin price when you press the play icon in the tasker app, the task is fine.
In your profiles section I see you set the value as "Mb2_tap2". It must be ""mb2_tap2" without capital letter.
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:18:37
You have to remove "Action=" from the value
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:10:16
Unfortunately no,  I don't think so
The advice on the title was about the phone/pc brightness, to better see the video.
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:27:36
Do you see a message on your phone when you tap on the band? Is the band connected to "MiBand2Func"?
@_date: 2017-09-05 05:41:47
Can you show me also a screenshot of the "profiles" section on Tasker?
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:48:10
Good to know :-)

This is good indeed, but  LG G Watch R cost about 20 times the cost of MiBand2! 
This is why I'm so excited about this setup :-)
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:40:22
You should have 3 actions on your task.
See this: 
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:34:08
Good. If you send me some screeshots of your Tasker configuration I can double check it for you.

1. I want a ready-to-use solution
2. I can't go online
3. Is not easy at all to upgrade a package on Talis
