Ummm, get a permit to start your protest route one building before theirs and end one building after.  Get the permit to do it as often as you're allowed.

This seems to be a PSA at least once a month.

Just like people who hate Howard Stern.  To see what happens next.
ps. I own bitcoin and love it. Although the community can be a little circle jerky sometimes.

Why is ghash.io "evil"?   They created a mining pool that is seemingly better than the majority of the other pools which is why so many people use it.
Is that correct thinking on my part?   I think other pools need to up their game to get more miners.

I'm sorry but as much as I love circle jerking.  She's tearing up b/c there's probably an itch in her throat that she can't clear with a 2nd cough on air.  Anyone who has even been in a situation where you don't want to be coughing like that first one a bunch of times knows that it's very hard to fight that tickle in your throat.  
It's pretty obvious. But then again, it's way more fun to make fun of her b/c she's a terrible reporter...
Also, let's not forget how the TV interview process goes down.  I remember last week or so, the guy that went on to defend bitcoin.  Everyone was swinging on his nuts about how well he did, he described the process minute by minute and it was incredibly stressful.  If she had a minute to grab a sip of water, this interview would've went much better (like some of the other ones people have mentioned that weren't as bad).

No, they usually put two that are completely wrong and one that might work.   She happened to pick the one that might work.

Okay, thank you.  I wasn't sure if I was missing something or not.

So what can we do to help the problem?  Run more wallets?
I've been out of it for a while now.  But if it's just running a wallet, I can throw one up again.

Mine LTC?  That's what I did to get an extra 200$ out of that card after BTC became too hard for a couple GPUs.

Because they bought at 900

Wait for it to go higher than your buy in price, cash out and profit.
