Then why not chain 4 different KDFs to make it extra, extra unlikely -- because that's not how good cryptography engineering is done.

One thing you're missing is that even a well-connected node can't get a block that doesn't pass verification into everyone else's block chain -- no node will *ever* accept a block with illegal transactions or that is self-contradictory (the same coins spent twice).
So your hypothetical well-connected entity that solves the proof-of-work and wants to publish "the block with a 'double spend' transaction in it" can't just publish a single block that spends coins twice (no one will accept it).  Instead they have to rewind the blockchain a bit, start building an alternate, and then make the new chain longer (by finding still more blocks first) than the "real" chain -- and do it faster than everyone else can grow the original chain -- not an easy task.
Add to that that no node can create a transaction for which it doesn't have the private keys.  That means I can try to spend "my own" coins twice, but not yours -- I can't even spend them once.
The upshot being that someone with a lot of processing power and good connectivity, is still pretty limited in what they can get other nodes to "agree" on.  They can't spend other people's coins, and they can't spend their own twice in the same block.  The best they can do is to try fork the block chain at some point in the past -- before they spent their own coins the first time -- and then build a new fork where they've given them to someone else, and then try to make that new fork longer than the one everyone else is working on.

Please don't do this.  It's neither novel, nor a good idea.  You're creating unspendable outputs that can't be pruned and growing the size of the blockchain without value.  No one can stop you, but this is like carving your initials in a tree in the woods.
Pop into  on freenode and someone will help you understand how many people have done this in the past, how most of them were finally convinced it was a rude waste, how how to achieve the same goals while creating transactions that can be pruned to save lightweight clients the carrying cost while still keeping the txn in the permanent record.

Things work much better when you put the URL in the URL part of the submission instead of doing a 'self' post.  Just sayin'.

Please don't re-invent this particular wheel.  The standard, well-supported [BIP38]( wallet format already uses scrypt for the same reasons you did.  Asking a user to pick both a password and a salt means it's not a salt -- it's just a longer password.  Salt is system selected, either site wide or derived from some info about the user, and unknown the the user.  What you have is an un-salted, scrypt wallet, which is exactly what BIP38 already defines.  Please just encourage people to use that.

It can't "hurt bitcoin" any more than carving one's initials in a tree can hurt a forest.  It's just rude, pointless, and silly.  It's been done so many times before, and there are better ways to do it that don't mar the landscape.

This isn't a Forbes article and neither are most of the ones linked here.  If the URL starts with  it's 3rd party content on what's essentially a blogging platform they host.  They're horribly diluted their brand by letting anyone hang content on their name without any editorial judgement.

I knew the person who named it thought it was bad and didn't understand heatbleed. There were plenty of alarming suffixes that wouldn't have achieved the first goal without the second.

Your PR seems to be failing CI test runs because you need to add a test for it.

Ugh, Bleed isn't a generic suffix for security problems.  Heartbleed was called that because a HEARTbeat would **bleed** out regions of uninitialized memory.  Cloudbleed did the same leaking of uninitialized memory from a cloud provider.  Antbleed is nothing like those.  It's as inane as using Gate as a suffix for any political scandal when watergate wasn't about water.

One way to check this is to go to  and move your mouse along the blue line (representing sell offers) until the line at the bottom that says "price $X ($Y required)" has a $Y value of $1,000,000.  That means it would take $1,000,000 to get buy the sell orders all the way up to that $X.  Currently I'm getting $12.75 for $992,000.  So up to $12.75.  That's only mtgox currently of course.

If you can't get your 2FA details back you'll have to contact each exchange and service's customer service and ask them to disable 2FA.  They'll want some personal info, and some will require a few weeks of delay after the send an email to the main account.
Next time consider the Authy instead of Google Authenticator.  It does the same thing but allows for easy encrypted backups.
@_date: 2016-09-16 02:34:07
Right w/o a backup you can't get the 2FA secret back, but the service can disable 2FA on your account.  Some services, Linode for example, require a two week cooling off period after disabling 2FA during which you can't login at all.

People pay for TA signals because they don't understand markets. People sell TA signals through excellent marketing.  People build TA sales empires because their lucky subscribers tell their stories repeatedly, and their unlucky ones slink away.  There is no science of the markets and anyone who tries to sell it to you is cheating you actively.

I bought a lot of bitcoin in August of 2011 at $11 after it dropped from $33.  In December it dropped to $2.  That's an 82% drop.  That's like $2800 going to $509.  I'm not suggesting what you should do, but at this point I'm pretty happy with the coins I held from then.

They didn't make it publicly known.  People figured it out by watching the block chain.  When thousands flowed from suspected silkroad wallets and into a new wallet shortly after the arrest, everyone made the obvious guess.  They've confirmed nothing.

When you've hashed the salted password on the client side and are communicating it int he clear ("No SSL required") what steps are you taking to prevent replay attacks?
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:57:48
Do keep in mind that QR codes have error correcting codes built in (fancy redundancy): 
Depending on what the correction level was set to it's possible (not certain) that the person with "top half" and "left half" could re-constitute the whole even though they have only 75% of the material.

This is incredibly great.  My employer uses expensify to reimburse us for travel, meals, and miscellaneous spending, and to date it's all gone into our individual paypal or bank accounts.  Now the co-workers I've been badgering about bitcoin for months have a zero-effort way to get a few.

The blockchain.info app isn't a wallet.  It's a tool for accessing a remote wallet stored at the blockchain site, and does some encryption and decryption locally, but can't, for example, actually send or receive bitcoins directly.  It connects to a single remote website, not peers as a real bitcoin client/wallet does.

If you use the transactions service that localbitcoins.com provides (which I use and recommend) there's no waiting for anything.  It already happened when the seller x-ferred the coins to localbitcoins (which only waits for 3 transactions, because that's plenty).  At the exchange the money is "released" by the seller at which time localbitcoins instantly moves it into the buyer's account.

I imagine they have a cash position too.  It sounds like they're advertising they use some very-cold cold storage, but shutting some of the fund back and forth between cash and bitcoin as they see fit is a lot of what they're being paid for.
