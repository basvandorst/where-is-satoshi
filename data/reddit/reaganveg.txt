[0.00000001 BTC is the smallest amount that can be handled in a
transaction](  So, at $600/BTC, it's 0.0006 cents.

It's *very* easy to create the hashes with javascript, using crypto-js:
    &lt;script src="
    &lt;script&gt;
        var hash = CryptoJS.SHA256("Message");
    &lt;/script&gt;
Ref:  
Of course you would want to host the sha256.js locally and use https.

That's the opposite of delivering physical cash.


Localbitcoins.com is basically a site where people can advertise bitcoin sales and purchases.  It is not itself a service which delivers cash for bitcoins.
Certainly, there's no reason to suppose that the prices advertised on that site will amount to less than 3% or even 15%.


Where can you sell bitcoin for a 0.2% fee?
Suppose I have $10 in cash -- a $10 bill.  How can I take that $10, get BTC into my BTC wallet, then use that BTC to acquire $9.98 in cash?  (Assuming also that I have a regular bank account and I can deposit the money into the bank account.)
I want you to link me to actual sites that make this possible.

WTF?  I defined it from an objective point of reference.
If some thing is *never* bought in order to be used, then it has no utility.  There's no point of reference here.  I'm not saying that if *someone* buys something only in order to sell it then it has no utility.  I'm saying that if *everyone* buys something only in order to sell it, then it has no utility.  NB. the number of people who would use a thing is an objective characteristic which is the same from the perspective of the people who would use it and who would not.
It sounds like you're repeating a scripted response, without actually reading what I said.

The collapse of the USD does not in itself imply BTC increasing in value.  (The rapid collapse of the USD is also wildly implausible...  but I won't argue that point.)
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:24:46


You're missing the point.
Just ask yourself: is someone going to eventually *use* it for something?  Or does *every* person who  buys it *always* expect to sell it?
With gold, there is utility -- even if most of the buyers expect to sell it, *some* buyers will actually use it.  With USD, there is no utility.  (Except as TP?)

The whole premise here is that the lack of impetus to produce is the *reason* for the basic income.

Bitpay advertises a 0.99% fee, but the figure is meaningless without also specifying an exchange rate.  They don't apparently *sell* BTC, so it's not evident that you can take $10 in USD and somehow convert it to BTC and then get $9.90 back from Bitpay.
(Keep in mind this is what the CC fee means.  The buyer pays $10, the recipient receives $9.70.  That's what the 3% fee means.  It's not a fee for one half of the transaction.)

It's a measure of how long the BTC traded on a given day was held before it was traded.  At least, that's what it sounds like to me.


It wouldn't measure BTC that had not been traded at all.  But, I guess, heuristically it might suggest something about the quantity of BTC that had not been traded at all, since it represents a propensity of BTC to get traded.  (However, it's not completely 100% valid to assume that never-traded BTC has the same propensity to get traded as previously-traded BTC.)

I just defined it objectively.  Whether something that is bought for re-sale only, or bought for both re-sale and use, is an objective distinction.


LOL, you're missing the point.  I understand that economics does not deal with utility in this sense, but that does not mean that this distinction is a false one.

The President of the AFL-CIO talks about the obsolescence of labor?  Really?  Can I get a quote then?  Citation needed on this one, definitely.




Did you even read the article?
You've gotten rude which does not make me want to explain things to you.  But I will give you another shot...
The point is, (and this was the point of the original article), if human labor becomes obsolete, then there naturally arises a new form of political claim to the machine product, that is not based on labor.
@_date: 2013-07-13 17:43:06


I bet you cannot give me a single example of a "union leader or politician" talking about the obsolescence of labor. 


Did you even read the article?
There is absolutely no reason to believe that, 10,000 years from now, human labor will be more efficient at *anything* than machine labor.  The machines can build the machines.


I never said anything like that.

But you're not including the spread!  It does not matter what the *advertised* price is.  The question is what is the actual *price paid* by me PLUS the actual *price paid* by my customer.  The important quantity is the *total* overhead going to *all* third parties.
It's not meaningful to look at any *one* transaction that is merely a *part* of the total customer-to-vendor transaction.  Sure, there may be some one part of the BTC transaction that is cheaper than the CC merchant fee, but the CC merchant fee enables the use of zero-fee banking transactions for all other parts of the customer-vendor circuit, whereas the BTC transaction may require other transactions that are not similarly zero-fee.


The point of talking about a single party sending money to self, is purely illustrative.
I can take a $10 bill out of my right pocket and put it in my left pocket, and I will have $10 left.
I can take a $10 bill out of my right pocket, deposit it in a bank, withdraw it from the bank, and put the resulting money in my left pocket.  I will have $10 in my left pocket.
I can take a $10 bill out of my right pocket, deposit it in a bank, use it to pay down a credit card that I use to send myself money via Stripe, which will then deposit back into the bank.  At the end I will have $9.71 in my left pocket.
If you want to compare BTC transactions to that $9.71, you have to look at *all* the third parties taking a cut in between the transfer from my right pocket to my left.  If I can't get money from my right pocket to my left pocket in the same number of transactions, then that means counting more transactions.

Tell me how I can turn BTC into cash on hand for less than CC fees.  Seriously, I would like to be able to do that.

What exchange?
Still, again, that's only half of the transaction.  To compare the transaction costs you have to compare the *full* price -- overhead of *both* sender and recipient -- since that's what the CC 3% represents.
@_date: 2013-07-13 19:02:28


It means that the exchange rate they offer is one-way.  So we don't see the spread.
