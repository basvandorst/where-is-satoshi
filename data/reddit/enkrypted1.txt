I quit watching tv and movies like 10 years ago. Sounds vampirish.
What does my 'theory' lack? You're saying there isn't enough meat, but some? Why don't you take your doubt a step further, and try proving to me that there is none? Everything is a grand conspiracy, ESPECIALLY, when it comes to financial markets.
@_date: 2014-02-15 11:14:32
In some senses, it's just business as usual.
@_date: 2014-02-15 10:35:53
Ahem... Like I said, I was a little early on the info drop ;)

Moon is relative, but we'll see a nice correction before end of the month.
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:23:03
Someone is paying attention.

Also, I never said it was IMF that greased fat man. Whom exactly is irrelevant, it's all the same players we've come to know. World bank, IMF, BofA, HSBC, all the same. I used the word strongholds for a reason.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:25:23
I'd also like to point out what I said below came to fruition. Another, Gasp?! How'd he know!? Keep watching.

No inner sancta of power, just a normal guy. Well educated and affiliated, sure. But I don't personally play in that realm.
What you want to see, you won't. Never will, won't happen. They'll kill. The reasoning is spiritual in a sense. To put it blatantly, there is an illusion around us and it's purpose is to serve as a learning grounds for us, breaking this illusion alters the spiritual growth of everyone on the planet. So for these reasons, you won't see what you want to see. The 'grey screen' doesn't show up on camera. No screenshots, no photographic evidence, not possible.
@_date: 2014-02-15 11:41:52
Really? JPMorgan isn't an IMF bank?
News to me. 
You of malcontent or just misinformed? 
Or caught up in the hypnosis that it's implausible that someone that actually knows something substantial would ever try to help guide people in the right direction?
Everything is traceable.

Multiple exchanges, btc-e for example, had implemented measures to protect against this exploit long before we were talking about it.
Not all.
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:48:02
Ummm, are you insinuating that ddos attacks are a bitcoin flaw?
Ddos can deny any service on any site by that logic.
I was referring to tx id malleability.
@_date: 2014-02-15 10:37:39
Another piece of information in your face backing what I know.
@_date: 2014-02-15 12:27:16
I can't, do your own research.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:22:59
1. Chase is closing checking accounts for those interacting with Coinbase.
2. Gox is now processing withdrawals. Gasp! How'd I know?! lol.
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:30:05
On the alternative universe, we all are.
And I wasn't aware of this. Honestly. Link?
I know they were ddos'd, but from what I understood those attacks had no merit as btc-e was protected, so the attacks subsided rather quick.

Let me put some icing on your cake. I'm aware of trading platforms you couldn't fathom exist. Grey screen, treasury screen, Bloomberg access anyone? ;)
I know why JpMorgan employees are being killed. I know of the movements of certain instruments that would shatter your concept of reality.
I normally tone it all back for you guys though. Too much too comprehend.
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:41:45
You might not see the link, but a friend of mine is an exec at capgemini, in the know so to speak. As far as friends of mtgox, look on bitcointalk.org forums. You'll see the offers.
@_date: 2014-02-15 11:17:01
I'll be interested to see what else slips through cracks between now and then.
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:57:59
He doesn't have to sell anyone's coins. Just create the issue that he's created. He's been paid to to do this. 
I'm not on my personal computer for obvious reasons, but I'll try to find links on forums of those buying the coins from mtgox. If someone else can find and link for me I'd appreciate it.
To clarify, publicly known associates of Mark Karpeles, are offering to buy your bitcoin of mtgox for a fraction of the price. The only reason this can occur is because of the fear induced by Mark not allowing anyone to withdraw from his site.
In other markets this is referred to as insider trading.
But big picture, it drags the price of btc down across all the exchanges, snowball effect. Allowing the good ol boys to come in and take over the market.
It's not that they minded paying $800/btc to take over the market, but reality is, you guys wouldn't sell them enough. This is just an elaborate attempt to shake the weak hands, save some money too.
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:32:35
Why all the downvotes? Someone doesn't want this seen, lol. Don't agree with what I've stated? Ask a question, worst case, I disappoint.
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:08:20
Got another 15 minutes to clarify if anyone has any other questions?
@_date: 2014-02-15 10:34:57
Ahem... I was a little early on the info drop. These down votes make sense now? lol.
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:33:10
Your intellect is refreshing. You might understand this. Karpeles isn't being paid in cash, he is being extended an unsecured line of credit through an IMF bank. I'm sure you can figure out why.
@_date: 2014-02-15 12:05:25
You should always be skeptical. But not so quick to rule things out. Instead of being skeptical, as this leads for you to rule things out before you understand what you're even looking at, remain aware. Awareness is everything. You want the truth, hunt for it. And as far as proof, it's called a grey screen for a reason. I'll be sure to point out the allowed clues in your face though. I may even tell you about them before they come down the pipeline. But, honestly with a enough knowledge and awareness anyone could've logically deduced this. Having certain networks is obviously to one's benefit.
Not sure what a replicant is?
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:40:27
@_date: 2014-02-15 11:54:46
JpMorgan and IMF have a 'tenuous' link?
How about one in the same?
What was cryptic about it? Fat man was greased into causing a ruckus to allow for market manipulation. That's cryptic?
Yeah, I have powerful friends. Sorry you don't. Not all of us discern our information from the msm outlets.
I can no longer entertain you.
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:34:35
Way overextended my stay, lol.
My final piece of advice for this community. Watch those that you put your trust in. The prominent figure heads in the community, especially. They are the biggest targets, and everyone has a price. 
When in doubt, follow the money.
If you're reacting off of fear, you're doing the wrong thing.
Logical discernment is your friend. Good luck all.
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:31:35
Greed runs the exchanges.
$300 is a great price. $200 is better.
This isn't an extra group I've created out of thin air, it's in your face:
One giant, elaborate, bear trap.
Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt.
Mtgox isn't the core issue, just the catalyst.
They're not insolvent, you guys will see soon enough. But they're definitely not to be trusted. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:52:30
I got kind of lucky. The day before this started unfolding I started using my bitcoin to buy stuff. Tigerdirect, overstock, and even donated to some not for profits I vibed with. Got $800/btc at the time.
And yes I've shorted btc before. The amount I have in btc at the moment is negligible to me. Under $10k, I've decided to not contribute to the chaos and let it ride. Busier with other projects anyway.
However, I am watching market and when it bottoms out I'll be purchasing a sizeable amount, that amount depends on whatever it bottoms out at.
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:07:23
Also, I don't do price predictions. Admittedly, I'm not a very good trader :)
@_date: 2014-02-15 12:33:37
Would you agree that reasonable and voluntary might be one in the same? See where I'm going? Now what if data comes to light showing the ddos attacks on mtgox were perpetrated by jpmorgan? Albeit, through a web of other entities? And no not every single corner, There are some divides but for the most part, there is one ruling system.
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:17:06
Yup, that's one.
@_date: 2014-02-15 11:12:57
Who said all the proof has come out yet? ;)
@_date: 2014-02-15 11:48:56
Also, I like bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-02-15 12:35:16
I'm (rather) certain you can find some info in the troves of Google.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:23:59
Looks pretty vertical to me.... Keep watching.

Funny how none of the 'regulators' have yet to address the real core issues. Such as the ones that allow this to occur.
And it is not a problem with bitcoin. That's essentially saying Mtgox is &gt; Bitcoin itself. Easier for mtgox to change their backend than it is for btc devs to change btc protocol. 
Need an example? Every other exchange that addressed the issue on their backend before this was a topic of discussion.
@_date: 2014-02-15 12:16:45
Trading platform.
@_date: 2014-02-15 10:36:53
This is called business and usual, your intuition was right, I was just early on info drop :O
@_date: 2014-02-15 12:25:09
I'm off. I'll keep what you said in mind. I do what I can with what I know. Like I said, just a guy.
You're smart, put that intelligence to use. What it could it hurt? Let's say higher minds do collect and create safeguards against these well known measures, for crypto currencies as a whole. Where is the harm in that?
While I'm sure this will be labeled a 'vague' or 'cryptic' assertion in the future. There should be 2 more reports coming out regarding major banking institutions and crypto currencies, within the week.
