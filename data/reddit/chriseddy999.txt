Oh yes, one more thing...
Does anyone have any information regarding if/why bitcoin will remain the dominant cryptocurrency? 
Any kind of 'bitcoin is the internet and altcoins are its websites' discussion? I'm looking for all the best info I can on the topic, was wondering if there's any specific video/article that's widely considered very accurate on the topic. Bears' perspective encouraged too!

Would be great to get any feedback on a couple of queries I have regarding the developers of BTC.
1) Since it's decentralised, what is the incentive for these developers to build on the network? Is it simply that they themselves own and believe in BTC? Or are they rewarded in some other way?
2) I understand it's completely open source, so anyone can build on the network. Once something is built, does it have to be 'approved' by the majority (95%) of the mining network to actually be implemented? If not, how does this whole process work?
3) if they aren't being rewarded through methods other than simply owning some BTC themselves, wouldn't there be massive incentive for the sharpest developers to shift towards centralised alternatives where owners have very deep pockets? Hopefully the answer to 1) answers this already, but didn't want to clog up the thread by posting twice.
Thanks in advance!
