Isn't this a good opportunity to mention bitcoin? I didn't know his channel before but I like his reviews about RC stuff and would also donate some AUD in bitcoin.

How big is a LN transaction including all the routing information that has to be flooded through the network? I guess a single transaction will create many kbytes of routing traffic?
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:19:59
This seems to be an active routing (routing tables) but how can this work when the channel states may change with every single transaction?
I think reactive routing is the way to go and then funds have to be reserved between the moment a route is found and the moment the transaction is finalized. ( to prevent race conditions between two transactions depleting a channel)
But this will create a way for DOS attacks (reserve funds but do not finalize the transaction).
I still wonder how all that is solved...

Bitwa.la is out of business for now. No bank transfers, no CC anymore. (see bitwala twitter).
Bitcoin (and companies supporting it) is constantly under attack.

are the limits required by the law? It is a bit strange, that the buy limit raises from 0 to 100 Euro after only confirming the mobile number. (since this does not add any additional security)

The only thing I can imagine is that some scammer sent a money mule to deposit this money into your account instead of sending it through western union like usual. (and now the money mule wants his money back) But it still does not make sense, because with a 150 btc reputation account, they could have just bought coins by wire transfer, without raising suspicion.
Revealing your ID when cash deposit more than a certain amount is completely normal even in Europe. But there is usually no way you can claim back the cash. This is only possible if the transaction was not authorized by yourself. (stolen CC or online banking credentials) But this can never happen with a cash deposit.

How is it possible to reverse a cash deposit? Sure bank wire can be from phished accounts and CC numbers can be stolen too. But cash deposit? Did he deposit counterfeit cash (via ATM) and the bank noticed later? I just cannot understand this part.

It's a very good thing, that people can buy bitcoins instantly. Many people surf the web and see "bitcoin accepted here" and then they try to obtain bitcoins but on most pages they have to wait for days (verification, bank transfer etc.). With your page, it is a matter of minutes (they just have to confirm email and mobile phone).

The help texts for level2 (mobile phone) and level3 (home address) verification are mixed up.
Great project, well done!

Only two points are really worrying:
- Too much mining power concentrated in china
- WTF DDOSed XT nodes?
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:50:00
He actually meant XT is dead, and since this should be considered an altcoin, it is offtopic on bitcoinobituaries ;-)

Did someone try short line=0, long line=1 or vice versa instead of clockwise/counter-clockwise?

The building on the back looks like the meridien. So i would say it is in or near loi kroh road. I will look around when i am there again. Meanwhile you get 10% discount when paying with lightning at food 4 thought near phucome.

Are all cloud miners ponzi/scams or do some of them actually deliver hashrate?
In case of a slowdown due to hashrate loss on the 1x chain it might make sense to point additional hashpower to there until the diff adjustment.

Seeing the 2400 eur ATH i was just warming up the cold wallet to change some BCH into something better. Seems like its too late now but of course it was obvious - empty blocks, inflation, empty pumped bubble

Zentralbanken und Aufsichtsbehörden müssten frühzeitig eingreifen, um eine Gefahr für die Finanzstabilität zu verhindern, sagte der BIZ-Generaldirektor, Agustin Carstens, in Frankfurt laut vorab verbreitetem Redetext.
What's misleading about that?

I couldn't wait to experiment with bech32. I moved some tiny amount to a bech32 address and then exported the privkey with "dumpprivkey bech32address".
Unfortunately no wallet seems to be able to import/sweep that key.
Mycelium (no segwit support) shows a legacy address with 0 balance.
Samouraiwallet just crashes /does nothing.
Electrum shows "No inputs".

Localbitcoins is banned in germany for years. Same with bitcoin atms.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:26:20
Article in german. The bank for international settlements seems to worry about crypto and especially bitcoin. They want crypto to be banned from the existing financial infrastructure.

Miners cannot hardfork. They will produce invalid blocks and lose their blockreward.
