2X camp's playbook:
1. Sell BTC and buy BCH, pump up BCH price and make it more profitable to mine than BTC (due to the delay in difficulty adjustment)
2. Rational miners switch to BCH, making it looks like "the real bitcoin"
3. Dump money flow in BCH, making it even more profitable to mine.
4. Step 2 and 3 repeat until BCH difficulty adjust upward by 5X
5. BTC once again more profitable to mine
6. Hash power flows back, BCH price drops.
Smart people can make a lot of $ along the way. Enjoy the ride!

Finance 101: ARBITRAGE. If the futures contract is going too high against spot BTC, arbitrageurs will long spot and short the futures. So there will always be someone who short the futures, especially when the futures is rising ahead of spot BTC. Cash settlement is fine, there are tones of cash settled derivatives trading everyday.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:44:14
Agree, a spectacular 12 hours to watch

@_date: 2017-11-13 16:16:51
We must make sure BTC is much higher than BCH
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:33:28
my current view is that since they are mining 1 block per hour now ( they'll make the new difficulty level 1/6 of current. So that they can absorb about 3 times more hash rate before the profitability reaches parity with BTC. If they don't pump BCH and dump BTC, they'll never capture majority hash power again.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:40:05
my pleasure
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:01:34
Could you please explain how the big miners sell BTC now without futures? Do they go to the regular market, or do they have some special arrangement with the exchanges?
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:45:16
The problem is when hashrate increases, adjustment comes faster than when hashrate decreases
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:16:38
Great analysis my friend, I believe you are a pro in the financial market. But I think BTC is still very different from equity, in terms of using leverage in the SPOT market. When futures rises before spot, arbitrageurs will short futures and long the spot to bring them together again. Otherwise the rise in futures cannot sustain. For equity, it's easy to long the spot with leverage; but for BTC, so far it's not easy to borrow and buy the "coin", at least not at institutional level. So my guess is that, for BTC, the rise in its futures market will be slower, as it's easier to short the futures than long BTC with leverage, and we may not experience that madness in 1987. But off course, access to leverage for BTC spot may improve and change the picture.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:19:53
unfortunately this sub has become soooo shallow. It seems BCH's 10 min adjustment frequency is too fast. Miners know that moving over there will only enjoy higher profitability for 1 block. And at the same time BTC/BCH price may change and also affects the profitability ratio.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:10:59
As an arbitrageur, spot going up fast after my long position is perfect for me, it helps me to realize my profit.
About your question, if spot is 8K and futures is 15K, I will buy spot and short futures, lock in that 7K profit NOW, rather than 30 days later with great uncertainty.
So back to my point: there will be a lot of people shorting the futures, if it's much higher than spot
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:19:05
When it's available in 2020, how many bitcoin will it cost? My guess is 1
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:44:47

Perhaps the devs are waiting for even higher fees, so that LN will be more attractive.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:34:31
12 hours later, BCH will be 5 times more difficult to mine, and it won't be more profitable to mine than BTC. Expecting hash power to flow back and end this madness.

@_date: 2018-03-22 14:30:16
I understand your point, buddy. But even in the very long run, when bitcoin's blockchain handles most smart contract, as long as your contract depends on external factors, like the outcome of certain event, there has to be some trusted entities to verify and input that outcome into your on-chain contract. Unless we have fully intelligent AI to do that job.

@_date: 2017-09-10 05:26:19
the value of blockchain is in decentralization. Banks, in current form, are incompatible with the idea of blockchain. Using bank's blockchain is like: you go to a post office 1 to mail a letter --&gt; post office 1 types and emails your letter to post office 2 --&gt; post office 2 prints it out and delivers to the receiver. Why bother with post office? Just use email!

Great question, I think it's because I "took the blue pill" first. I'm doing pretty good in the current system, and as a result, most people around me are similar and don't care about an "alternative". Although I frequently feel disgusted by the status quo, I couldn't see a way out.
This May one of my clients mentioned an ICO he was interested in, and I decided to read about blockchain and cryptos just to have some common language with him. And voila! I found the red pill!

What prevented the inflation is that all those credit are still in banks' account at Fed, as there's no way of lending them out giving the struggling economy.

Agree. Actually I always tried to begin with its tech potential, but perhaps they are more interested in price ;D

I never wanted that. But the current institution will not just give up overnight, if they realize BTC is unstoppable, they'll try and find a way to "parasite" on it. Issuing BTC backed bills seems one way of doing it. For countries with censored internet access (ex. China), it becomes more likely

Don't FUD, no matter it's bitcoin or fiat. They skipped the May report, but more frequent stats are still here:

Bitcoin doesn't need gov's greenlight to run. People can just start using it for transaction and ignore the fiat money. Government can ban it, like China did, but banning bitcoin is technically difficult and those marginalized economies' gov may not be able to do it.
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:58:26
no banks won't. It's a prisoners' dilemma scenario: N banks agree to kill Bitcoin together, but if one of them deviate and deal with bitcoin, this one will make $$$$$$$$$$$$
So the Nash equilibrium is a short-lived agreement

Lightning Network (LN) is a second layer payment channel that will solve the scaling problem for good. To establish and maintain such a network, each node has to "deposit" some BTC, and the amount will limit your overall transaction capacity. For example, to maintain M channels each with N BTC capacity, you have to "lock up" M*N BTC in the LN. If you have many BTC, you can serve as a "hub" and help other nodes connect with each other through yourself, and charge a reasonable fee for it. Just search "Hashed Timelock Contracts" if you want to know the details.
Anyway, with this thing, you can lock some of your BTC for a month and earn an "interest" from the fees. There'll be a huge market for creating hubs with different capacity and maintaining period.
I personally believe this tech, once realized, will blow the banking sector away and send us to moon or mars.

It'll be quite sad if your first point is true. I agree with your second point, but for most other economies still in "normal" situation, the cost to switch seems too high. We need some marginalized economies, e.g. Venezuela, to switch first and make bitcoin more stable. Then there'll be more and more to follow

That three surges are QE1,2,3. What Fed did was buying mortgage related securities from banks, and credit banks with "excess reserve" (means deposit at Fed over reserve requirement ratio) at the Fed. Fed didn't even "print" the money, they just credit banks from thin air

Thanks, I'll give it a try
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:19:31
Yes and No.
First of all, at this moment institutional holding or BTC is literally 0%. Yes some of them will short, but as long as they increase their weight to a positive number, the NET result is institutional buying bitcoin.
Secondly, even the ETF is based on futures, price impact of purchasing the ETF will be transmitted to spot bitcoin price, otherwise there'll arbitrage opportunity.
So all in all, bitcoin ETF will save McAfee's dick.

@_date: 2018-04-06 09:51:28
Let's ignore the cost of carry and other complexities in futures pricing and say fair value of futures (F) always = spot BTC price (B), and ETF price is E. All contract sizes are standardized to 1 BTC.
Now let's say E &gt; F = B happened due to $ inflow to ETF. Arbitrageur will short N (borrow and sell) ETF @ E, buy N futures @ F to create N ETF and close her short position. Profit = N*(E-F). While she is buying futures, she will drive up futures price and making F &gt; B, which is another opportunity (short F long B). So eventually $ inflow to ETF will drive up spot BTC price, other factors equal.
The opposite case is the same logic.
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:46:09
no it's not false, check my reply to 
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:55:58
You don't really understand how futures market works. The arbitrage trade between ETF and futures has nothing to do with whether it's cash or physical settlement. I believe you have never traded futures by yourself. Learn more and think more, and you'll understand what I mean. Before that, don't trade futures as pros are going to crush you.

You can spend bad money ONLY when some one is willing to accept it. Gresham's law, right or wrong, is only half of the story. Instead of encouraging Spending bitcoin, we should encourage Accepting bitcoin.

to all of you   who pretend to know a lot about investment, current global fund asset under management is over 80 trillion USD ( while BTC's total market cap is just over 100 billion. Do your own math, even if ALL BTC are owned by funds, it's just 0.1/80 = 0.13%. So yes, it IS literally 0%! I don't care how many tinny tiny funds that hold BTC you can find, because their size don't matter at all. Please educate yourselves first before calling out other "insane" or "false". Thanks!

Read the CBOE/CME bitcoin futures production spec file, and figure out how the settlement price of futures position is determined, and ask yourself if there is a link between ETF, futures, and Spot BTC prices, before coming back showing off your ignorance. Thank you!

Once new users get familiar with crypto through FB, they'll figure out the true value of BTC
@_date: 2019-05-03 00:06:45
exactly, without crappy early search engines preparing the users, Google wouldn't grow so fast on its own. If FB is smart, they'll at least facilitate BTC on their system, then there'll be an exchange rate between BTC and FBcoin. Like gold and silver. If FB is not smart, they'll try to suppress BTC but a truly decentralized crypto like BTC cannot be suppressed
