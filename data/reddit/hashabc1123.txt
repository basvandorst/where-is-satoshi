You can trust me. Just send me your Bitcoin and I'll make sure you get 3% back a week! Also if you have any friends I will give you 1% back of what they send me and they can earn 3% interest too. For every friend that your friend sends to me I'll give you .5% of what they send me. Start your own business and be your own boss, it's the dream and you can have 5 cars and 2 mansions like me.

As long as the long-term trend is ***up*** I consider it a long-term investment with cash that I do not need immediately. Am I going to use it to store rent and cost of living... no because of said sudden rise and fall in price. 
What you consider a good store of value depends on time and how undervalued you think the asset is compared to its future value. Now it's a question of, how do you determine the future value?

20 cents with the potential to turn into $20k

~~I'd feel the same way too if I bought in at ATH, the emotion is real. Glad I didn't.~~

You wouldn't be laughing, or maybe, I guess you would if you stored your dollar as Bitcoin back in 2009-2016.
If I were in the future 5 years from now and to look back to today, I'm sure I'd be giddy and happy if I held Bitcoin and Litecoin.

Try to research these areas yourself. Current active users vs potential. Tech Developments, Political Developments... Market Developments.
I take all those factors in and I form an opinion. Now, all you need to do is believe in your research enough to act. All this information is publically available, you are responsible for your own actions. You may not believe in it, but someone else does. Who are these people and how much influence do they have? Who are they and what are their motivations?
Jack Dorsey for example. CEO of Twitter and Square, publically announced that square will eventually accept Bitcoin. A while back he and a few others including Charlie Lee invested into Lightning Labs. That's 2nd layer scaling for Bitcoin, instant transactions with a fee that is comparable to nothing accepted at every Square POS. They also have the Cash App that allows you to buy and use Bitcoin.
BAKKT &amp; Starbucks...
Union Bank, Philippines... Remittances worth Billions in potential being sent across borders from Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW's).
Samsung Galaxy S10 that includes a crypto wallet
... So to answer your question, how do you determine the future value, my answer is a lot more than it is now. It ran up to $20k without much of a user base but now it has a name for itself and a lot has been developed. It's hard for me to conceive of a situation where it does not reach ATH again within the next 2 years. At the current price, that's an amazing ROI.

The money is on the blockchain, not the phone. Just like a Trezor, they may have the device but that does not mean they have access to move the coins unless they have you.

I was just playing, but just to play more with the idea if I had a wallet that connected to an API along with a good UI as well as having a 'throttle' built into your wallet as a safeguard, maybe there's something there.

You're right. There's a lot of counterintelligence going on on Reddit. Things are said in ways like what iPoopedJustNow did with the word "Locked" which that alone makes people think they can't get their coin out for an extended period of time but it's completely wrong. As you said they can pull it off of the network at any time.

The best analogy I've thought of is Email Vs snail mail. 
At one point it used to be 100% snail mail. Then the internet was created and it became 99% snail mail. I'm not sure what the market share is between the two now BUT i'm confident that majority is done over E Mail.

Obviously, there are caveats, but any number greater than 0 using this to purchase items with their Bitcoin, yes, even though it's on a custodial wallet, is better than 0.
More and more people will be curious about using their Bitcoin at retailers, they'll ask those working at those retail locations, and those working at retail will be exposed to it, might purchase, or tell their boss who will then tell their boss. 
It's better than nothing. If you want nothing you don't have to do anything.

We've come a long way down. Looking back, buying in now seems nice, and the fundamentals and development are substantial. Bitcoin is at a discount with a lot of potentials.
