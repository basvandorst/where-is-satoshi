what will they use the money for?
@_date: 2016-08-21 22:37:39
I would think the desired capital flow would be to buy bitcoin, not sell it.
@_date: 2016-08-21 22:36:08
LibertyX.com to see if there is a store near you. Need to use cash though, but there is no wait period like Coinbase/Circle.
@_date: 2016-08-14 23:43:06
LibertyX.com may have a location near you. Check out their store locator.

i wish my employer would pay me in BTC :(
@_date: 2016-03-17 15:59:56
i always recommended libertyx and bitquik to my noob friends.  why are the founders stepping down?
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:22:38
what are the debit card fees?
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:07:01
check out libertyx.com for local stores or bitquik for banks
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:24:47
libertyx.com. depending on where you live, you probably have a local store where you can use cash and buy bitcoin instantly.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:31:03
there are stores and banks near you pretty much everywhere. check out libertyx.com (buy with cash at local store) or bitquick (deposit cash into someone's bank acc)
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:07:13
that is pretty awesome
@_date: 2019-03-28 20:55:10
Agreed. I think we are saying the same thing. That's exactly what it looks like the OP posted (traditional ATM upgrade). Surprised no one has done this before. Cash bitcoin kiosks are getting all the rage.
@_date: 2016-01-14 18:59:11
nothing more instant than libertyx. had bitcoin in my wallet before i left the store using their app.
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:41:18
i've claimed probably $50 in free bitcoin from being the first to purchase bitcoin at a bunch of their new stores. their new app is a big upgrade as well.
@_date: 2019-03-28 20:40:06
going to give it a spin!
@_date: 2019-03-28 20:39:46
Isn't that the point though? Lower friction =&gt; lower cost =&gt; more adoption =&gt; BTC moon!
@_date: 2016-03-23 15:36:12
wow. know what small bank they use? does GS do biz banking?
@_date: 2019-03-29 02:03:33
Yeah those flashy ones are a honeypot for sure. I feel like I read about someone breaking into one every few weeks.
@_date: 2018-10-16 09:55:25
I would think the fees would be lower as well since you don't need to deal with the cash logistics. Some of the BTM operators like Bitcoin Depot/Bitstop are charging in excess of 12-20% so will be great for us small time buyers. I tried operating a Skyhook back in the day (OG) but it was a nightmare. Did they say when this will be rolled out?
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:40:08
can me old fashioned but i prefer handing cash to a cashier instead of a machine so i've been using libertyx to buy bitcoin. they have stores in most cities around the US. just searched atlanta and it seems like quite a few.
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:10:04
check out libertyx to see if there is a location near you. usually half or a quarter of the BTM fees from experience.
@_date: 2016-12-08 03:14:17
i use libertyx and localbitcoins. they've both been around for years and work. working is the most important thing for me. all the other companies come and go.
@_date: 2016-12-08 03:15:00
is it a btm or libertyx store?
@_date: 2016-12-11 19:37:05
Looks like they have a Preferred Store 1.7mi from Minneapolis. i just did a search:  
i've had only positive experiences form their Preferred Stores, their PIN stores not as much
@_date: 2016-12-17 16:58:23
I would second this. I used to use Circle but Libertyx is just as easy. Only change is you have to go to the store to pay cash but there is no waiting period or low $20 limits like Circle/CB.
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:29:49
Just paste the Ledger wallet address into the LibertyX app to get your code. Give that code while paying cash to the cashier and the bitcoin will be sent to your Ledger direct. It's fine with your setup since LibertyX doesn't offer a wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-11 19:37:41
I'd keep spending money in a mobile wallet and the rest in a hardware/offline wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-02 02:20:35
how much are those?
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:40:42
Awesome. Depending on how much BTC you need I would buy from LibertyX first (can't beat no fees for first 1K, 1% thereafter) until you reach the daily limit. Then use this bitcoin ATM for the next $2K until you reach the $3K limit? 
...Or buy from LibertyX and sell to this machine? Infinite profit! 
Has anyone had a chance to try it out?
@_date: 2016-02-23 22:01:19
libertyx for 1k/day
@_date: 2016-02-23 22:02:23
has someone done a survey on user satisfaction? i would imagine a bimodal distribution.
@_date: 2016-09-14 17:35:59
Awesome. I'm going to try later this week and report back. Beats the 10-15% I'm paying at BTMs right now.
@_date: 2016-09-15 19:30:53
Have you purchased from them? I've been using them semi-regularly and its worked well. The blue markers on the map are unreliable but the red/green markers work every time for me.
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:54:30
No better solution for instant bitcoin. Way more trustworthy IMO since you are dealing with a cashier at a store instead of a bitcoin ATM that doesn't work half the time. 
@_date: 2019-05-31 18:55:35
can buy a regular ATM, make money from customers that want to withdraw cash and then enable libertyx for bitcoin. if you don't want to deal with cash, i'd recommend libertyx.
