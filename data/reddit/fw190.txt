To understan bitcoin is to understand how it works and why it works. I don't think he could be bothered to waste time while someone is explaining him how SHA-256 works, and that's just the begining.  The whole technical side is very opaque and abstract to majority of bitcoin users. He might be a smart man but I just don't see him properly understanding it from that side.

5€ sounds about right for regular wire transfer fee

Wait, you're saying that having closed source apps is good thing aka security trough obscurity?

Same goes for Wikipedia. Jimbo is soliciting donations with his ugly mug but won't accept BTC. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:53:17
Yeah... man, I just shat by the toilet on accident, here's my btc address

WTF, $100 for this?

Read my post again, it's 1 iOS version and 4 androids, that's at least 75% of all phones, that's 5 versions of backdoor in total. Closed source google apps and what version are they don't matter.

QR is old but when the hell was it good? Its best before date ran out long time ago, if it ever had one. And you can have your phone camera always on processing images searching for code but only for half of hour until battery runs out of juice.

I know it's not right for sepa transfer, I'm just saying that bank might have done regular wire transaction to get more in fees. I don't see mention of transfer type on  both of your bank statements, why don't you check it with a bank?

Android is Google walled garden but mainstream is not aware of it yet.

It's the same thing as Xbox private key in processor. The only way to read it is maybe with electron microscope. Processor is doing encryption, you can't get to key. It is possible to hack something else up the chain, that's what jailbreak does.

Is there a way to nominate this guy for, I don't know, "integers in computers" award or something?

The whole article boils down to speculation with no reason or explanation given for any of it's points.

Your story doesn't hold the water and alot others don't. There's pattern right there, you're not the only one this, I'd say day to post such post.  Even if it's true, why you want people to send you the money? Got nothing to eat?

Mining bitcoins is a bit different than running one while loop while i is less then 100 billion which takes minute and a half. Also, how do you know ripple won't print another 100 billion of whatever? Maybe you should read up a bit on the subject, then come back.

I bought BTC from them and when I was supposed to receive it I was informed that I had to buy some "membership" first. Why did they let me buy BTC if I didn't have required membership in a first place? Maybe it's extortion then? And on top of that, I had to wait 3-4 days before I received BTC even though they claimed they have several BTC in stock. Anyway, I got the message, they don't want my business, I'll take it somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-02-22 12:25:02
I bought BTC from this site but each time had to wait couple of days, even though site said BTC was "in stock". Customer support didn't answer emails either. I got my last order only after I mentioned chargeback. 
Not to mention "bronze membership" pay trap scam.

What's the percentage of Android phones running closed source Google apps? There's the vector. Android has serveral versions of which maybe 3 or 4 make majority. So you need 4 (maybe) versions of backdoor. That's not an obstacle so situation is the same on iOS as well as Android. Everything else is just a spin and my phone is better than yours dick measuring contest.

I waited 3 months, good luck with that. Better cancel withdrawal and do it via bitstamp.

It's not about stores. Google has stopped publishing source code of their apps and is forcing device manufactures to make Android phones with whole set of their apps or nothing. If your phone comes with google apps, you're in their walled garden. You might try and do without these apps but you'll suddenly feel like it's 2010 again.

computationally expensive block chain is where the value is. Ripple has none. Getit or should we ask shittywatercolor to draw it for you?

I don't mind membership thing, but why allow people buy BTC before they buy membership? Either way, there is other service and I can have as much as BTC as I want in a mater of minutes. And they don't have 'quick' in their URL but are in fact very quick.
