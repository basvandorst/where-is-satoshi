I'm probably reading too much into this, but after thinking about this story a while, something occurred to me.
The "hitman" in that scenario's name was readandwhite. Hm, immediately makes me think of the Hell's Angels being known as red and white.
Then my inner deadhead came up with this bit of a song: "Red and white/Blue suede shoes/I'm Uncle Sam/How do you do?"

I wouldn't have fallen for it but I can see how some people would. 
I hate these kind of things because it makes me distrust a lot of my emails. Now anytime I get any email from Paypal, no matter what it says or what it's about, I just delete it on the chance that it might be fake.
Long ago I remember getting some fake "Paypal" email trying to tell me my Paypal account was compromised, please enter your info, etc. Except when I got the email I had just come off the Paypal site and knew good and well there wasn't anything wrong with it.
I guess you only need a few people to fall for it to for it to be successful. Sigh. Assholes. A pox on them all.

Hey, at least you were smart enough to just send a little bit.

OK, this is a really dumb question, but having just gotten onto coinbase and haven't done much on it yet, I see a box asking me to buy however much in bitcoins. Is it possible to just say, hey, I want to buy $10 worth? I'm kind afraid if I say, buy this much bitcoin that the price will rise dramatically.

Cool, thanks.

Thanks for this. I was thinking of buying my first smartphone and wanted something I could use for playing around with Bitcoin. 
Android it is.

OK, so does this mean that if I put in an order today for, say, $10 worth of bitcoin that I'd get whatever $10 worth of bitcoin is by Friday, Nov 22? I'd hate to say, give me X amount of bitcoin and then it turns out to be too expensive for me then.
BTW, thanks so much for lowering the minimum purchase.

Where are you buying the bitcoin from? I just set up a wallet recently and haven't bought any yet.
