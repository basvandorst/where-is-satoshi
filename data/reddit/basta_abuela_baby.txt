I, too, enjoy laughing at others while contributing nothing of substance.

Apparently the threat of "liberation" is just as viable as gold when it comes to backing a currency.

"So, you put out a sign saying 'All You Can Eat' and then got mad when patrons dragged their chair up to the buffet and took up residence?"
You are lumping two problems together:
First, the original design assumed that individuals would not create a new industry to optimize what was assumed to be a fairly generic proof of work algorithm. That assumption was wrong, and it is a good problem to have (if one has to have a problem), but still a problem in that it centralizes mining.
The second problem is that the proof of work algorithm contained a flaw that means it doesn't prove as much work was done as it was intended to.  This is the Asicboost issue, and it is a bad problem to have, as it devalues Bitcoins.

I make the claim because the original paper doesn't explicitly state any assumption that Bitcoin would create a mining hardware industry in its wake, and an assumption that large would certainly be stated.
The paper also makes the unstated assumption that hashes *aren't* being calculated on an abacus or using some other method that makes such computation impractical for human lifetimes.


Bitcoin's adjusting difficulty of work is not contingent on the flaw I mentioned.

Pssshh... you're just jealous because I make a billion trillion dollars a year.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to fill up the trunk of my car with million dollar bills so I can go grocery shopping.

To extend your analogy, if less than 5% of the Earth's population even knew *what* gold was, I'd be pretty bullish about buying gold in the long run.
