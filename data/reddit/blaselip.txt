I guess what I am struggling to understand is why Bitcoin is treated as a speculative asset, like gold. I gather what I'm missing is that Bitcoin isn't only about the transmission of value in an incorruptible, it's-all-there-on-the-ledger way... but also a hedge against the devaluation or possible corruption of fiat money? Am I getting closer?

Ugh, homework, thanks... Okay, I think I already understand how the market cap is established. Like in theory if everyone decided to HODL except for one person, and he asked for double the price, the market cap would suddenly double if someone paid his price.
I guess my main query is why there's a market at all? It seems if Bitcoin were just about transmitting value (albeit in a virtual way) then having it's price fluctuate and soar seems antithetical to that purpose. Like why isn't the value in line with the amount exchanged for it on a previous date. Not gonna spend it on a coffee today if that Bitcoin increases many fold a few months later. But what I think I understand now is that it's treatment as a stock/asset is much the same reason as golds... We place value on it as a hedge against inflation and as a store of value... Which is because Bitcoin is seen as so darn secure and limited and incorruptible.

I think it's the store of value thing I overlooked. Although it's still hard to wrap my head around. At least with land I understand why people covet it. Everybody has to live somewhere, and some places are better than others. I think the analogy with gold is better. Limited but less practically useful. More of a place to dump wealth securely, and be an insurance against one's native currency devaluing. Which the properties of Bitcoin afford.
