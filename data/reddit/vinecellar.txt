I don't usually see a 10 year account with &lt;10 karma. Damn.

My sincerest thank you to cryptocurrency "visionaries" who believe that all shitcoins will one day soar as BTC did.

Weird. Never had an order fail. Although I've taken a hiatus since the start of possible chain discrepancies.
Are the market (price) orders failing too?

Can you *really* even travel with bitcoins? When you travel with a calculator, do all the numbers travel with you? Is 7483924 in your bag?

Neat that you can still pay with bills consisting of nothing at all.

Yes, well, you are not obligated to answer the questions, but they are not obligated to let you on your flight. Suffice to say "I'm getting off", and they won't ask you any more questions, I'm sure.

It's a joke. A few flights back I heard a man utter "my body is ready", for which dozens of people burst into laughter.

Needs more comik sans.

Why so? You don't get the backwards compatibility, there's risk. What downsides of the softfork/BIP are there?
@_date: 2017-07-14 22:17:41
This is the only real downside I see to this whole drama. That a bunch of cheap derivatives might jump the market. The two credible chains is eh, it will be sooner or later that one dies, by a pretty democratic choice. If we have 6, 8, 10 chains, we might as well have someone build for bitcoins what Unity is for games.

It can be a growth asset kind of deal. Ideally an underprivileged socioeconomic class person should invest in even smaller housing in a to-be gentrified area. It's especially beneficial for the poor, because you can't live in a stock portfolio, but you can live in your home. Slap a recurring tax on that and you cheat this person out of a smart investment back into poverty.

That second part is agreeable, many work as TSA agents because they can't find a job for their qualifications. As for that first part, you haven't seen the stupidest people, clearly.

Not a smart thing to do, considering whatever momentum the land value has. Especially with gentrification or substantial economic recovery/growth. So property taxation is pretty much cheating the poor out of their growth assets.
I personally have property which is too expensive for my income. I acquired it in a ex-soviet state after the collapse of Iron Curtain. Property was dirt cheap then. Over the last 25 years, it has increased in value by 264x (yes, by 26429%). Thank god or whatever there's no property tax. I make what my property is worth in four years!
