Thanks for the direction! I'll check those projects out.

Haha, is this a joke? Bitcoin definitely is not like houses or food.

Implementing elements of digital cash into the central banking model only prolongs its reign. That's why it's troubling.

No, I don't think central banking is going away any time soon. But that is why Apple Pay is concerning. It's simply a theoretical divergence, wanting incremental advances to move from one system to the next versus a wholesale changeover. Given the ways in which central banking is *currently* proliferating economic stratification, it's concerning when market leaders roll out new and innovative ways to keep that same structure in place. At the same time, I don't think a wholesale changeover is even feasible, because the impetus required would be a catastrophic breakdown in financial markets that would probably end the energy availability necessary to run a cryptocurrency global economy. 
The idea that central banking has "worked decently well" is subjective, and there is no way to know whether avoiding centralized banking would have served us better or worse. The advancements in civilization over the past 100 years have been driven by oil-dependent technology and conveniences, and I'm not sure that central banking was necessary to achieve those advancements.

I like your view of BTC as an insurance policy against the centralized monetary system. Even if it's a long shot that it comes to fruition, the potential value of its use in that scenario is so high that it justifies hanging onto it and not cashing in. As far as that going against the principle of using it as a means of transfer, well, you'll be doing that plenty if and when that insurance policy comes to bear : ) Don't worry too much about your individual part in crafting what BTC is about, what it does. Let the foundational logic of crypto play itself out and enjoy the benefits of being an early adopter later on.

You're a silly goose.

Because such a site would require securing licensing agreements with the owners of the content. And absent an upfront payment or a verifiable revenue stream to provide compensation for the duration of the contract, those content owners wouldn't agree to allow their content to be streamed. Bitcoin would not provide the stability and predictability they want.

Basically: how would the market's opinions get conveyed into the math of the cryptolaws?
@_date: 2014-08-07 01:58:12
Definitely not incompatible. I like the mentions of contracts and arbitration on OpenBazaar.

Lie! Tell 'em you buy shit with BTC all the time!

The people who were working full-time on internet-related endeavors in 1994 likely retired years ago and haven't actually worked those 20 years. So even if it takes *a whole twenty years* for something to change the entire world economy, yeah, it seems worth it to stay involved. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 21:28:57
Oh well then hellllllllll yeah!

Maybe Bitcoin could make a google voice account, equip it to give automated, circular feedback that only frustrates the caller, and then cryptocurrency can take over the world. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 22:52:48
Good. Then people who are holding will sell, the price will go down temporarily, and its usefulness as a mode of exchange will become more apparent.

Really fun visualization of a world that utilizes some of the most exciting social aspects of cryptocurrency--nice work! 
In this hypothetical, is liquid democracy being applied to the population at large to determine the parameters of the crypto laws and societal direction? How would that be achieved on a practical level?
