As a CPA that's helped some clients with their crypto taxes, It's always been the law. They just clarified it. 
If you buy a Bitcoin for $100, it appreciates to $110, and then you buy Ether, you just have a $10 realized capital gain because you technically "sold" your coin and purchased another. Every single time a portion/coin/group of coins transfer out of your possession, it is a taxable event. So now if that $110 of Ether drops down to $90 and then you buy some LTC with it, you just realized a $20 loss. If those were your only two transactions for the full year, you would report a cumulative $10 short term capital loss on your return. If you ended up with a net gain, you would report that total short term capital gain and pay taxes on it at your ordinary rates.

The law hasn't really changed my friend. Most accountants will tell you this is how it always was. All this law did was take away any prior vagueness that more aggressive accountants took advantage of to claim crypto to crypto transactions were like kind exchanges that yu can defer gains on. You can use FIFO, LIFO or specific identification for now. Your accountant can better guide you on which would be more beneficial for you.

Haven't advised clients on forks and frankly, the IRS hasn't released any information on it. But using what's already in the code, a new asset was created that you didn't expend any value on. So your basis at the time of the Bcash fork was zero. If you hold on to it and sell it after one full year from receiving it, you would qualify for long term capital gain treatment ranging from 0% to 20%, capital gains tax depending on your total taxable income for the year.

Original question was regarding fiat so that’s what I was answering to. For now, you are correct though. 
As more competition comes to the field however I would imagine that exchanges will start offering crypto insurance to their customers whether that be through self-insurance (Binance) or through an insurance provider.

Coinbase is FDIC insured for USD so no safety concerns up to 250k there I believe.
