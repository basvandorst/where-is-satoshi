IMPORTANT UPDATE   CRYPTO is NOT banned by RBI, News is that all the entity under RBI will not deal in cryptos. There is no ban on payment made to exchanges. Like bank deals with dollar - pound selling n buying, that's it.
Mr. Varun - Blockchain Lawyer, has checked the RBI Press Release which has created this FUD .. so while we can also wait for the public info from exchanges or the circular to be issued and we have decided to analyse if a PIL can be filed. if we can get support from this group in becoming signatories to that PIL, we have valid point to reach Hon. Supreme Court for this.
Moreover, do not panic sell at falling prices which has no correlation to USD worldwide market! Read and Analyse news, do not believe what newbies spread their "outlies" to you to shake your positions.
I hope this helps you from preventing of fake panic selling. ✌✌
