If you can and have the means to I'd suggest cost averaging that over an extended period. You can hang on for the ride up, but there can always always be a down. And when you need to spend money and the BTC price is down you'll end up spending more BTC. Your also going to need a CPA who can work with such an asset class, preferably an offshore financial law firm, just kidding. 
I suggest you do that before you upload you bank account to the internet. Because if it goes down to $4k and you have payments. You'll be using many more coins. So I'd do a good solid 70/30 crypto/fiat balance. You always want to have some extra liquidity when it drops to scoop then up cheap when you can. Been banking with the crypto since 2013. Been a great ride!

I sure hope you know how to mix, and that a 'mixer' by nature runs on an algorithm that will 'tumble' your coins. Algorithms can be easily reverse engineered. Let's hypothesis on this one for a second. Coins come into a wallet from said 'mixer' and are spent, you really think they can't track that. Seriously!? The ONLY possible way is to have printed out a paper wallet, have an obscure copy of the X-pub key and only deposit funds there. Because when they raid your place, it's all over. Your phones, computers, documents are all up for a good search and it's almost impossible to hide a wallet when your caught unexpected. Correction* if you have a way to reference that wallet whenever you want to send funds there, odds are they will find that. 
Oh, you wanna buy something now? Using Bitcoin from the suspicious wallet, the IRS aren't stupid maan. They see the coins move, the will get your shipping address from the payment processors, who will get it from your merchant if they have an issue. Oh I almost forgot �� maybe you just want to cash the coins from there, which is obviously going to bring them right back to you. Basically those coins are as good as gone if you get into serious trouble. Actually you might as well consider them gone right from when you decided to 'mix' them.
Maybe many of you are forgetting your accounting 101, many institutions offer crypto-back fiat loans. So no you don't need to sell your crypto, you can simply take a loan out backed by it's value and repay that loan over a period of time. 
Really there is no GOOD reason, unless your doing something naughty, to feel the need to hide your crypto assets in the event of an audit. If your fucking with crypto on a sizable level, your accountant and lawyer should have already explained this too you in addition to the banking offshore and guide to tax mitigation leaflet. It's NOT illegal to get professional help in mitigating your total taxes, in fact it is VERY normal. It can become illegal when you pay nothing in taxes but drive a Lambo.

Not to hard one to answer. There was a website for this, it's just beyond me right now to remember it. The short answer is yes, one can derive your X-Pub key with a few of your addresses and you bet it fits into a bigger ecosystem. So yeah, I can probably see you buy coins from CB's ecosystem and send them into another ecosystem (cold storage, mobile wallet, Binance, Gemini, whatever...) 
Sure her husband can set a Google page alert so whenever the URL blockchain.info -wallet is updated a nice notification shows up. Because coins are orphaned and that's just a matter of fact, it be damn small odds if any for anyone else to be assigned the same exact key pair so it would be a good assumption that the seed was recovered by the original owner.

Whoooo buddy. Can I get you to PLEASE cite your sources on crypto NOT being taxed unless trading IS your profession. I am a mathematician who does a lot of things, including software development and algorithm constriction. I operate a trade bot, but I'm not a trader. I have a couple brokerage accounts that I trade stocks on, and investment diversification but I'm not a 'Trader'. I'm a hardcore academically trained mathematician. 
Could use the beta you share. Obviously your not going to get taxed on crypto trading because crypto is only crypto until it turns into D∆LlA$. Did you just overlook liquidation situations? 
Your telling us that if we went to liquidate 50 Bitcoin we wouldn't owe anything to the IRS?
@_date: 2019-08-17 20:38:36
Sure. I'll be right there selling 100 BTC worth in a public place. Right. Even 25 BTC. Then what dude? You putting that cash under your bed? Gonna take it to the ��? 
Register with a non-US exchange. Get verified. Link up your accounts. Depending on your resources, level-up to a 'business account' (consult your accountant &amp; mind your jurisdiction). Bitstamp, Kranken, ... 
This way, you get digits to show up in your account, close to spot pricing and you don't even need to leave your house. Coins don't need to leave your Trezor until your ready for them to show up in your bank and vise versa. 
People don't know your DON'T own bitcoin ��. Seriously. The only place I would find use in P2P OTC trading is while traveling. Super useful to be able to go anywhere in the world and get local currency for Bitcoin. In many places in the world $1 USD goes along way, and you really notice it in third world countries trading Bitcoin.

Let's just look at it from a -not so private- or -on the fence about privacy- persons point of view. I'd say a majority are in this category. 
I would highly highly suggest Apple consider working with the Trezor team to incorporate a way to make the Trezor compatible with the embedded FINTECH security features it is hoping to provide. Let's say I don't care if Apple knows I have one Bitcoin on my Trezor. I'm sure you would see hords of Apple users flock if they saw the Apple wallet had expanded functionality of storing crypto, trading crypto for cash, integrating crypto into the Apple card. Offering crypto back loans or lines of credit through the Apple card with crypto as the asset class backing the credit. 
Guys this is the future of mobile payments. I can scan n pay, I would like to have the option to scan and pay with Bitcoin.
Call the widget "Wallet" like "Phone" &amp; "Messages" on all devices moving forward. Really Apple should be getting in on this with wearables and NFC payments. Digital finance and financial services are huge inroad for Apple. This "Wallet" could be just like the 'Cash App' but -for us / by us- for Apple Mobile users.

Hm. Interesting. Recent LA resident, myself.  However I have been in the ecosystem since 2013. 
I would point out the very obviously price fluctuation in BTC value, and that rent is due the first of the month. Brings you to a slippery area where what if the coin price is relatively constant at $10k then drops 35% in 5 months for 4 months out of your year. I'm all for banking with the crypto, but minimum wage employee are rolling dice in the short term if they are going to try to bank with the crypto. Coming from within the ecosystem I can say that sure over the long term it's up, but you never know when it'll dip and for how long.

I do wonder, if anyone has Satoshi wallet for his personal stash of coins? Wonder if he uses what he created. Wonder if he still pays attention to Bitcoin. Wonder what he is working on next. 
I honestly wonder more about the sort of projects Satoshi is stabbing at these days. What interests him or them now that bitcoin is where it is. I wonder if Satoshi is going to come out on his death bed, or if he will take it the grave with him. If he will ever touch his personal stash of coin or if he plans to cycle them back into the ecosystem.

Remind me in 1 years to see which services have some base of operation in Portugal. Bitpay? I bet this is related to the spawning of Libra and whatever headway Facebook and MasterCard are trying to make so they can process FOREX vs Libra. I'm calling this one, I see it coming.

I agree with this statement ���� Facebook taking the initiative to dive into an easier way for them to collect money from users worldwide is a great idea for Facebook. Facebook collects billions in add revenue globally, it really isn't a big leap for them to try to streamline the payment system within their platform. If you use Facebook for business and whatever else, then privacy really isn't your biggest concern. You buy a Libra to run an add for shampoo your US business is running in India. 
What has been interesting is the government push back. Suddenly when a HUGE social corporate giant even remotely thinks of offering another form of payment aside from US dollars. They shake. 
However I can also see the Libra coin as being one of Facebook's most valiant effort to mitigate the taxes they will pay in the future. 
"Oh man! We made $3.5 Billion US dollars last year in the US. Gotta pay a tax on it.!"
"Oh man! We made $30 billion Libra last year in the US. Move it to 'Isle of Man' and let it sit."
The whole premise is US companies pay taxes on $$$ they earn. Not on Libra they earn. If Facebook just redirects you to a place to buy Libra, and use it on their platform, they aren't collecting USD directly. They are collecting Libra. Sending it to a Tax Haven and cashing it out there. GOD! It makes complete sense for Facebook to pursue a project like Libra. And I honestly don't think they are done with it. I believe they're still working on it behind a strong curtain with or without the support of MasterCard or anyone else. Really, what was MasterCard going to do with Libra anyways? Use my MasterCard to buy a Libra? Facebook should pursue their Libra project, for the sole purpose of streamlining their own ledger and accounting system. 
Full disclosure: I am deep and long Facebook stock.

OP Just went down the list, of things that would get you banned and just checked them all off. 
LMAO. I remember when I was once accidentally credited a coin. I though about withdrawing it and my funds, but then I thought about the fact that it's stealing, I already have my own coins, the coins is probably someone else's, and I opened up a support ticket and had it resolved promptly. Even support didn't believe me and froze my account. 3 days later my account is unlocked my account was upgraded to tier 4 from tier 3 (higher transaction amounts). Best choice was realizing how pissed I would be if I lost a coin, and returning it. Exchanges do pay attention to that stuff, because it doesn't happen very often.

I most certainly would like to at least peep at what he has poppin under his hood. Could Satoshi also be Tengi137? I mean the cloak and dagger was cool, but Bitcoin is unstoppable now. So "fear for life" I doubt is much of an issue now that adoption is becoming more widespread. I doubt they would kill Satoshi. Anyone still know Satoshi OG wallet?

This is NOT illegal in the US. Make sure you have the proper paperwork squared away with your tax attorney and accountant, which I hope you have if you plan on doing this and if you don't you should consider hiring one because trust me, if your books will get very messy very fast if you don't do it correctly from the start. Ideally your going to want to have your Corp docs buckled down and register that business and yourself with an exchange, then proceeded in making the purchase through your business account. You also want to consider setting up in a state with little or no capital gains tax, so you can more easily move between fiat and crypto, and retain more of your profits or purchasing/setting up a subsidiary of the company in a different country to mitigate your expenses. If purchasing a company, you just transfer majority shareholder to your local business and refile the ownership documents. Your accountant will be able to better do your accounting, because it's common practice for accountants to work with corporate books. You definitely need to consult your tax attorney, and have them make sure all your boxes are checked. You should* invest in professional advice (on retainment) especially if you plan on entering the cryptospace with +$1M, as this is usually the threshold for various auditing flags. 
You should also be prepared to follow all AML and KYC regulations willingly, which shouldn't be a surprise. You also want to tell your attorney what you plan to do, if your going to be making this a frequent thing (quarterly, monthly, ...) They will give you better advise on how to and where to incorporate.

You took your money offshore and hid around the world, but we found you. You went on the dark web thinking that your actions were anonymous, but they weren’t, and we again found you. You now deal in crypto-currency, again thinking this will make you anonymous, but our agents have once again proved that there is nowhere you can hide.” He added, “We will not stop in our pursuit.”

Their is an entire DOJ division that's made to watch you, it's called the NSA. Yeah that bird in the sky, the camera along the roads they're all on YOU. 
Am I missing something here? What's this issue with KYC? You wanna open a bank account? You need a name and they need to make sure they know you. Same thing. Ok, you don't want a bank account. Fine. You know how much a million USD in $100 bills weighs? You going to put it under your bed and play with it? You going to carress it at night? No dude, you want that shit in a bank where it's insured or in something that makes your money grow. You need a name for all that stuff bro. 
Haven't you people ever heard of holding companies? Jeez, if you DO have something to hide then DO your job at keeping that shit on the down low. You can say 'Fuck KYC' but that's all you'll get man.

Just another one to add to your portfolio during the next pump... Stack up some Gold, trade it locally for cash and that's your rent n some for the few months. Gotta realize these numbers are super amazing if you can take advantage if them properly. People in real life still use dollars, and sure Bitcoin is the future gold and wat not, but you might have forgotten about tomorrow or the day after. These pumps are a great opportunity to double up on coins and all, but you should rightfully take profits in the short term and live a little.

Why the hell not.! More power to you and whoever else is in the same position. It takes patience and persistence. With a traders mentally, in that at some point you should sell some of it with an intention to do stuff with the profit and buy back in, because you can always do that. Hold and grow you wallet while you can slowly waiting on the sideline for a solid run, and break em out...! Make it rain. Diversify and reinvest. Rinse and repeat till your kicks are nice and clean.
With Bitcoin it really helps to try to think if it as cost averaging. If your thinking of buying in now, do it.! When and if it drops don't panic just buy more and cost average your investment. Only spend what your willing to lose, but keep you coins safe no need to leave em on an exchange when you can put them in your pocket!

You just have to be handling that kind of money flow. What gets reported, and not something you should worry about if your bought your coins is if it's an abnormal transaction.

A SWIFT transfer if your anywhere in the world. SEPA if your Europe. Generally a SWIFT transfer will route anywhere in the world. Most exchanges send a SWIFT for large amounts of money and waiver the fee if your business require. Either way with crypto being the way it is, moon is an arbitrary point of reference because -one- can always assume it will go even higher. So if your a disciplined trader, you take your profit when you can, invest wisely, cost average if your holdings depreciate, use the basis spread method to equalize your realized profit. You also don't need to actually sell your crypto. You can take out a loan backed by it value and pay it back in crypto or USDT. Depending on where you are you may or may not have access to the services. 
My own experience, I managed to get a good 1/6 of my total wallet before coinbase froze my account Jan '17 but honored all the transfers. I reentered about a year later.  Had to pay Uncle Sam, but that was refunded thanks to maintaining transparency. Cleared off my student loans and moved. Now that I know, I started myself a business and I do a lot of algotrading and have diversified to different investment instruments so I'm always moving money around between my brokerage accounts and exchanges. I now understand this $10k scare point. You don't need to worry about money laundering unless your mixing ill-gotten gains with legit money in an effort to mask the dirty gains it's origin. Many crypto exchanges and OTC brokers have bank accounts in the regions they service. So yes, if a different person is depositing $9,010 in cash into your bank account every other day for 2 weeks then that's a red flag. But if you bought $300 in BTC (6 times) from XYZ when it was $3k and when it hits $100k you want to take out $10k (6 times) the transfers are going to be reported by XYZ that you bought BTC and sold BTC, set some aside because you'll need to pay Uncle Sam.

You implement YOUR own investment strategy! Forget the cost of Bitcoin because your looking at it wrong, think of it's 'value'. Like Gold. Most people don't buy gold low and sell high. They buy gold when they can and HOLD it. They may have bought a bullion or coin when it was very high, but they also bought a bullion or coin when it went super low. Making their average cost lower and lower as they add more and more.

So far, I've spent nearly $65k on my HF bot in just development and backtesting. What exactly do you want the code to do? Start selling at a price and liquidate your entire portfolio as it hits the lower limit? How fast do you need your program to react, because latency parameters can become a real prick especially if a 'trailing stop' is what your trying to set? 
The bots you see 'in the wild' might do this for you. But really it's just a few lines if code. I'd be careful with the trailing stops because I have been noticing traders will cover a call causing the price to drop quite a bit before recovering, similarly they will buy up a bunch of coins to cover a call causing the price to shoot up for a very brief period of time. ∆t (time to execute) must be an adjustable parameter or you'll notice that flash sells trigger your trailing stop while you sleep and you'll find yourself waking up to losing trades.

@_date: 2019-12-05 04:46:47
I totally agree. All these statements of "�� wallets" moving are just a result of trade transactions. Everyone was talking about how CB has some 1.2Mil BTC in a cold wallet, little do they understand is that they provide the service of securing trades (buy/sell) orders and they NEED a minimum to be able to float the fiat sent out. In order to provide their service they MUST have at minimum XXX amount of assets. Most institutional investors hold their crypto in multi-sig cold wallets. So the fact that $9 Bil USD -moved, the first thing I think of is 'a new partner or investor signed on or an old one signed off a project.'

These 'Whale' wallet post by Forbes and Bloomberg are unsubstantial in any way shape or form. Most institutional investors have their crypto assets tied up in multi-sig wallets. So when a new investor signs on to a project, or an old investor wants to pull out of a project they move the coins to a wallet that includes/excludes said individual or entity. Large wallets, and the movement of coins they hold have no effect on the market when they are moved, I don't understand why Forbes and Bloomberg keep hammering away at it.

Modern encryption still relies on the same old encryption algorithms, only now they are insanely long hex strings. 
So in theory you could crack modern encryption with either enough time or enough computational power. 


Tokenization, specifically user tokenization has been implemented for a lonnnng time already. What it tokenization? It's the aggregate user information compiled to form a unique signature. It involves using various constant and predictable features. 
Really they could just go into a state of emergency and jam all airborne frequencies. It is, after all, in China. I don't think they give a shit about the right to free speech.

Similar situation, but am applying to more technical/finance fields and quant firms. 
Do they pay in crypto? Are you on the US? 
Glad your enjoying the 'remote working' you probably will for a few years. I got out of school, and started traveling around the world. From Tanzania to Thailand, from Denmark to Kashmir. It was a beautiful experience, and at the time I was doing a lot of start up work, working on a few of my own projects, and some open source material in exchange for crypto in compensation. Because It was easier and cooler to travel with Bitcoin and exchange small bits for the local currency as I needed. 
Best financial choice I've made in the last 7 years of my life, because the cost of living abroad is sooo cheap and a the value of the Bitcoin kept increasing. So I managed to save enough crypto from my work, to leave enough coins for a -possible- couple generations. So I'm looking for work to get me sane again. Routine, and other minds to collaborate with. It's funny when a job hunt goes from, a need to want. A need for money turned into or a want to work on higher order, more complex FINTECH solutions and their global applications.
But I will say, being a Digital Nomad, and working remotely can get very lonely. Sure you meet people everywhere, but you also leave them behind when you move on. Learned a few new languages, had a bunch of great experiences, but coming home I really felt alone. You don't realize it, until you come back home and a 1/3 of your college buddies are married and 1/4 of those have a kid or have one coming. You feel like you kinda missed out on life ��...
The process of reintegrating back, is a process. Sadly. Everyday is a new day, but be sure to keep a solid balance between your work life and your actual life. Don't let the remote part dictate your self discipline. Sometimes it's best if you leave your work behind the computer when you close the screen. 
If you already have kids, and a wife then I can see how remote work would be excellent. Get to watch and play with your kids more is always +1(dad) choice.
I'd also wonder if they paid in crypto? And how that works for the IRS. When I was doing it it was very very grey. Is their an income tax on the crypto? Is it realized upon liquidation? What if you don't liquidate it all, does you income now become a capital asset?

Bitcoin has gain such wide spread use, and to the Average Joe it's still above their head. Bitcoin WILL be the supreme standard. Anything and everything new will be vis-a-vis the almighty Bitcoin because it's gained maturity to a point where market manipulation by whales pumping and dumping is becoming non existent. Rather now in recent times you see computer reacting to other computer creating a strong cascade down, to specified technical values where you notice the trend pattern stop (likely some sort of failsafe or dropout function causing tradebots to slow down and mitigate looses) this is suggestive of a much more resilient financial instrument that can only be developed by market maturation and liquidity. So Libra and whatever else enters the space will be vis-a-vis Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin is vis-a-vis a currency. There for by a transitive property Libra (or -next best thing-) is vis-a-vis a currency, any currency anywhere in the world.

See this is why I try to deliberately not call it an investment. I call it an instrument. Because that's exactly what it is. It's a financial instrument, to say it will replace currency is speculative at most. Why is Bitcoin and instrument and not a traditional 'investment' like gold or stocks?
1.) It is highly liquid in the global currency market. People will still use a physical medium (USD/GBP/EURO) to buy a soft drink. That won't change. Sorry, people won't use a Satoshi, or a Libra for that.
2.) It doesn't occupy a physical space, so logistics in transport is negligible. Yet it is still finite supply. 
3.) It is entirely independent of the existing monetary structure, yet interconnected to the global money supply. So it lacks any fundemental value aside from it's connection to FOREX. 
What I mean is, if people are assuming in the 11 years of bitcoins existence it is on course to displace gold...
Then, who is to say that in the next 11 years we don't have 2 other parallel instruments that money is flowing through? The assumption made here is that crypto may expand on itself and provide more ways for money to flow through the internet.
-side note- think of the situation the USD would be in if the global markets are pegged to 1 Satoshi rather than 1 USD. And we assume no more money is printed. How violent do you presume stocks will swing in that situation. It would make hedge fund managers and EVERYONE on 'the street' pull their hair out. Smart traders, get off on volatility but that kind of volatility would be outright insane to trade on. Now tell me your IRA and 401k are there and I'm running for or to 'the hill'

If you can buy futures on a currency why not Bitcoin. When you really think hard about it. What invention connected the plugged the world in? The internet.

 I been HOLD'in since 2014 and you have no idea how many different agencies called me, and the slew of questions I had to deal with cashing out just 50 BTC at the high in the latter part of 2017. 
My US account where frozen for a few months pending 'internal investigation' basically a fucking nightmare until I clarified that I'd been holding them in my Trezor since early 2015. Even still I was milked hard as hell in taxes, paid off my student loans, and was left with enough a little over a quarter in cash to reassess how to better go about it. 
So all this BS about money laundering is just that. If it is happening, it's being done by insiders in already established institutions within the cryptospace (like the BTC-E launder) moving massive amount of cash in and out of the crypto space. Try buying +$200k in bitcoin in one shot, then try selling them in one shot and have that SWIFTed to your US account.

DefCon 2019 a talk on cracking encrypted message on Signal. Check it. 
I'm well aware of the keyspace, again your assuming a 256 bit hexstring. Currency computation has a capacity of 512 bits. Making the keyspace exponentially greater. Again I said "-in theory-" because it isn't actually possible, nor is it likely. 
What would worry me, is if they are able to decrypt whatever 10% of encrypted data, all they would need to do is start to train datasets, add gradient parameters, and have a machine learning program and automate the decryption of the remain subset of keys. If a single key pair is decrypted successful, then it's reasonable to assume the remaining keys are equally as compromisable.

So with enough capital and a solid reserve you can just cycle  your cash flow without actually selling your crypto, and repay on the ups. And use liquidity to rebuy if it dips.

And he is right. I didn't get to sell as many as I would have liked to at $16k I just wasn't  prepared to handle that much cash flow properly. But the ecosystem has developed.   And it has become very much akin to Gold, and will continue to develop. 


This is a classic trader dilemma. Bitcoin blows it out of proportion. You can ALWAYS have MORE money, but how much money does it take to make you happy? Like really. Just think about it for a second. HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU NEED TO be happy?  Because, the next guy will have more, and on and on. The secret is, to make a shit ton of money and tell no one about it. I take my profits when I can, I never try to liquidate entirely, and I keep liquidates available to re-enter if needed. It's important to know this. Because you don't need SO MUCH to live. A car, a place to stay, some food, clothes and some company if fortunate. If your trying to hard on any of those, I'm of the opinion that it's not necessary. More power to him, but your going to sell your 2014 Porche 911 for Bitcoin? You should keep it, it's going to give you more enjoyment than the 3 Bitcoin you'll get from it. Should have done it long ago. Sell your house and downsize for Bitcoin. Sounds like a ��idea, now we are talking a good amount of coin. Depending on how he financed the house. He could see a solid couple hundred racks from the equity, that's a good place to start DCA a collection of Bitcoin. 
If it gets back to $16k I drop off 10% of my portfolio. Up to $30k another 10% liquidates, goes up to $50k I'd probably liquidate a solid 40%. And leave the rest of the crypto for my kids and their kids..

Similar. The Reimann-Zeta function was or still is a million dollar question. 
The more appropriate one would be the p vs q derivation. But yeah similar. If input you in a plane and sent you somewhere far, but all I was didn't tell you where your going and gave you three tickets to get there. 
This is a crude example, but it will suffice. We maybe could find your last flight. No problem. But if you left NY to Africa to Indonesia then to China. It would be virtually impossible for anyone to tell if you DID infact go to Africa. You could have stopped over anywhere else in the world. 
It's stacking of various encryption function like Samirs Secret Sharing Algorithm + RSA + .... 
It's not in possible to figure out. I honestly would take supercomputers and dedication. Your already fucked if your a subject of targeted surveillance.

�� Hopefully it doesn't get to $99k and come crashing down. 
This scarcity thing is getting old, because it doesn't assume infinite diversification options in the future. It assume that the same instruments we have today are going to be the only ones around WHEN bitcon takes over gold. People will ALWAYS want MORE options of places to put their money. If I own bitcoin, I'm going to add some gold, silver, stocks to diversify.
How many billions are spent on campaign finance? What about Libra. That could be a perfect example of a parallel instrument. What if Facebook's stock shoots up they strategically buy up a billion USD in crypto just to allow Libra movement, and the crypto ecosystem is now divided between Bitcoin and Libra? Add to that you have a grip of money flowing into the system during campaign time and out towards the end. 


Great in theory, you must have a few coins youve been collecting and saving for sometimes hu? That's good! But what you just said, I don't even think about. That shit is so far out in the crypto time frame, forget it. 1.) Depending on another service that doesn't exist to profit 2.) Assuming it will go down after it goes up to 6 digits.

It's not wealth until it's cold hard cash and can be categories in class if assets that have a fundementally and almost constant value. How can you tax an instrument of 'wealth' when at anytime it could be worth 50% less than it's current value? Until they start accepting Bitcoin for tax settlements I don't see an easy way for ANYONE really to know to total amount of 'wealth' one has. Take our great Mr. Trump who is an expert in hiding capital and wealth through a slew of offshore subsidiaries, that are -party-�� his own.  
LMAO. Try getting anyone if the Panamanian or Cayman Island banks to respond to an email regarding a client's finances and/or holdings. They don't need to and won't tell anyone anything unless ABSOLUTELY necessary. I don't see that happening until I get to +$50mil and my accountant is really not doing his/her job.

Either way, the only real threat I see to encryption is quantum computing. Even still, many people from around the world are currently working within the field of 'Quantim Cryptography' but even that is some time in the future, and when it is available to consumers and general people there are BRAND - NEW encryption algorithms to even better protect the next 60 or so years of computational innovation.

@_date: 2019-05-30 04:56:39
Neither. I guess "Pro" I personally trade the swings on Robinhood, but my Trezor stays as my go to storage device alongside the Mycelium app. Coinbase banned me during the first pump, I guess I unloaded to many too fast for them their system flagged my account for some reason. Seriously what were they going to expect? I was a broke recently graduated mathematician who started fucking around with Bitcoin because the crypto was dope to me in my field of studying. So yeah I unloaded a grip of Bitcoin and an even bigger amount of litecoin on them pretty much out of nowhere. Either way it gets grey when you 'get rich quick' everyone and their mom wants to know more about you. Lucky for me I really was a broke ass mathematician with a grippa coins sitting in my Trezor since 2013.
It was a bitch to get any kind of support from them during that time, lucky for me they heald up their end and I was able to liquidate a good amount by the time the spike was dieing down. There is BitStamp and Gemini who support US customers. You'll get the best pricing going directly to the exchange and withdrawing and holding from there. There are also apps like Abra, and Cash app that support purchasing Bitcoin, but those are secondary trading parties. So you will get secondary prices. They make money connecting your trades to an exchange and charge a fee for it. It may not come on the form of a 'fee' but you'll notice it because the exchange rate is always in their favor (buy higher or sell cheaper). 
I pretty much think those grey times are gone for the most part, it needed that first pump to get off the ground. Now it's easier for you to not get flagged because your transaction history will show your pattern of purchasing, etc...

Please* replace 'mainframe' with whatever 'current appropriate' word is for the server side (vs user frontend) of the exchange. A 'maimframe' is what they would call the main logic structure (language independent) of a program in the mid 70s. Goes to show I've been in infosec/netsec probably longer than you been alive. 
There is a more technical term for reverse packet tracking. I guess I'd be to old to tell you, either way I shouldn't have mentioned it as you (the general public) probably shouldn't know it's possible. And no I can't disclose my employer.
PS. How the hell do you think catch people who try to hack into Bank, ACH, Trading houses? Maybe you might to try it and see if there really is a 'reverse packet tracking' and you'll see it quickly if you get close enough to something your not supposed too.
And I'm surprised you even know of such an old attack vector buddy, was it in your computer history class or something?

I woke up this morning to a bunch of stop lose limits in my portfolio being executed. And I'm about to short out what I have to break even on those sells. The US stock market and Bond/yield rate coupled with the lack of displacement in the FOREX value of the USD makes me very nervous. But it also has me looking for the best time to buy in, in a couple quarters I'd say. Real Estate is so slippery right now, I wouldn't dare consider financing a house. It's just not liquid enough for me to feel safe in. Even with my current active BTC portfolio of 10 BTC I'm making good enough money interday trading to call my trading days 'good days'. That's just swinging +/-$300 daily between the peaks and troughs on a 10 coins position. Forget about finding returns like that in the stock market unless your striking the spot on options repeatedly and consistently. 
I think I'm going to be leaning more towards 40/30/30 crypto/stocks/FOREX set some solid buys in on semiconductor sit back watch Trump talk shit and the market react to it, and wait for a good time to re-enter.

BINGO them nice dividend paying blue chip stocks are fantastic passive income. Buy BTC with you dividend pay outs! That's not a bad idea.

I feel you. I honestly don't understand how successful day traders get off on 15-25% ROI and how on fucking point stocks are. A tenth of a point off on earnings report by a company, send their stock +/-10%. Kinda lame coming from someone who fucks with huge swings in crypto. I literally have only the slightest bit of insight into fundemental analysis, because FOREX vis-a-vis BTC is all technical analysis and more than enough of it.

Maybe it was or maybe it wasn't an inside job, but I assure you someone on Binance's staff was likely compromised. Not to mention that upon assessment not this breach it was likely in the planning for a few months by a few skilled operators. 
Your required to 2FA and Email verification when you withdraw funds from the exchange, so in theory the attackers might not even need to worry about them if he gained privilege inside the network. They didn't steal the coins in your wallet, they stole coins that had been actively placed as either a buy or a sell (hot) wallet, because the finds that your wallet is storing are (apparently) on cold wallets. 
So it wouldn't take much of a leap to say that the hackers gained high privileges on the network, the API point likely just helped them find the hot wallets commender control over the main (hot) wallets then 'sweep all funds from subwallets' to a wallet  or wallets likely still within the Binance mainframe (to avoid being flagged for a HUGE transfer) and then to wallets outside the platform. Likely from the hot wallets as well while they already have high admin privileges. Once they saw it work for ~1214 BTC they went in for all the other hot wallets. 
Now you see classic money laundering tek, breaking large sums into smaller and smaller and smaller amounts while everyone is watching. They're on the hot seat right now, and they know it so they're pulling some Jedi mind tricks to keep everyone entertained. At the rate they are going, theyre likely going to break it down enough and the transfer it all through something like XMR and so on it for sometime, till the heat dies down. 
Although I must give it to them (the hackers) for this breach. Highly planned, skilled operators working as a team, plent recon on the exchange infrastructure API keys, verification, 2FA verification, email verification, the exchanges structure of HOT-COLD wallets. Most of which would have required some kind of internal access to the exchanges mainframe, so a compromised employee sound more possible than an inside job. Unless all or few Binance staff are in on it in some form. Either way it's not easy to hack these exchanges, if it's a group of individuals then I reckon it's the same group who have been behind the other recent hacks as they have an extremely good understanding of specifically 'hackimg crypto exchanges'
However, I do want to express concerns as to why Binance unlike other exchange didnt run cloned �� servers to divert or confuse the hackers. Banks, corporations, and everything that has to with really top level security run cloned servers that mimic the real server, so as to confuse the intruder, log their attack method, run reverse packet tracking to uncover the attacker and the exploits they are using with causing any effect on the actual server. But then again it would only help your doing a black box hack, and insider would already know the server configuration.
@_date: 2019-05-09 22:50:55
Haha, ok. CSI tells you all about traffic logging, server requests, packet authentication, database infrastructure, cert verification, dynamic payload deployment. 
If that's the CSI your watching, then it must be very entertaining to watch people slamming on a keyboard. 
Yeah 'Reverse Packet Tracking' when you use a VPN to do you naughty and the �� logs all you little moves and turns it over to the feds so they can follow up on you cute little prebought VPN configuration. You really think 'Unauthorized access to computer and/or network' is something GCCP is set up exactly to do. Track your traffic (packets) globally.

Although this is true for most millennials, it's definitely NOT true for those who have been riding the BTC waves heavily since 2012. No joke, Bitcoin has been able to help -this- mellenial (and I'm sure plenty of others). Had a big fat ass 'bag' of litecoin that I fumbled into trading early on when btc-e was around and just forgot about stashing them on my Trezor. Just that bag of LTC cleared my student loan, buy a house, get a spanking dope ride, and reset my career with after the first pump. Bought back in almost 3:1 while diversifying my portfolio bro include stocks...I feel so blessed to have had come into it the time I did.
In a way I'm totally contributing to our GDP guys. I hope. Although I doubt I'll ever get the top 1% but I'm totally fine being on the upper 20%. I just don't understand how the hell you can ban a publicly distributed via internet ledger from a state. That raises a bunch of privacy concerns about my internet freedom that I don't support. He's probably pissed because his son didn't bank in on the rage earlier and has student debt from a preppy private school. 
Now with the US stock market correcting hard AF + recent inversion of the bond/yield curve have investors running into an economic climate that's very unique. I only see a positive climate for such a price dynamic instrument.
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:44:24
Really? Really? You really think someone with 'User' level privileges did this? No way in hell. They're attacking exchanges mainframe and people who have access to it, no users who slide puzzle pieces around as a captcha. 
To be honest you really don't know that an exchange takes 'security seriously' or not until they're jack knifed like this. And it could still happen to any exchange out there operating right now. 
I had a strong feeling about Binance API token scheme, usually when working with API keys and API endpoints they should have been updating the API keys or having user update them quarterly, and use different hashing algorithms to produce non sequential and virtually random strings  to update the API keys regularly. This could have prevented the hackers from getting to the actual exchange targeting the Hot wallet Database. Basically they collected the API keys and secrets likely through some sort of SQL injection or web browers exploit and subsequently dumped the API keys. So now hacker-team has a nice spreadsheet of a tens of thousands of API keys, that they can various methods to ping the associated wallet, aggregate them into the recently dumped API keys, and assuming they already have privilege escalated within the internal Network, I don't see how it would be hard to 'allow withdrawal' across all dumped keys... API keys and secrets should be changed regularly.
