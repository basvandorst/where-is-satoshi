Can I buy with bitcoin at my local store? Or does it have to be online?

My problem with these "estimates" is people thinking that Bitcoin is some lottery ticket and a easy way to make yourself a millionaire in other words, wishful thinking.
It isn't. Promoting these ridiculous "predictions" are ignorant individuals that know nothing about the true value of BTC.  
The true value of Bitcoin is not from individual wealth but as a decentralized currency that can truly influence the world by changing it.

Predictions are dumb, predictors are dumber.

My problem with these types of posts is that it promotes or "hypes" up bitcoin for the wrong reasons. 
Does Andreas constantly talk about the price? No. Why? Because he is a very well educated individual and he knows that at the end of the day the price is a part of this but it is by far the smallest part.
I'm not trying to attack you or your reasoning, I'm simply pointing out what type of people posts like these attract.

I understand op's optimism but seriously, people have to stop being delusional.
Please read and educate yourself so that you can derive a well thought out opinion based on realism...not far fetched dreams of wealth in the future.

I feel like i'm going to win the lottery, it just feels eerily similar to that pattern where other people win the lottery. 
I'm going to win the lottery because it "feels" right and because it follows a pattern.
OP plz fix the logic centers of your brain.

I feel your pain fawksey, but remember next time access ur wallet via virtual machine/linux, its way easier to set up than you think. I have a laptop exclusively set up to access my btc. 
P.S. You have a kickass body and i would totally go he-man on you if u were straight.

Everyone here has given this young man correct advice. But people please stop with the bashing and swearing, what the hell are you all immature teenagers or something?
Bitcoined, listen to the people here, you made huge mistakes..i'm not saying you can't make it back but it requires discipline and experience that you don't have.
My advice, DO NOT touch the money that you have left. Get a job. Invest in bitcoin with your own money not your sisters. Above all be smart, learn everything you can.

i'm wary of bitinstant, for many it has worked, but for a few their funds have disappeared or it takes a very long time to transfer to their Mtgox account. IMO, it should not be this hard for newbs like me and others to buy BTC. I know it's a often talked about issue but, i feel like there has been no progress in its resolution.

Hi there Trevor, first off, I think your work is very important for bitcoins future and i wish you lots of success. 
I recently bought my first bitcoin :D, my process was painful, I live in Puerto Rico. I first tried to get my funds to Mtgox via bitinstant but for some reason the moneygram/zipzap thing didn't work and bitinstants support was no help. I had to finally settle for Dwolla and it took them 7 days to get the funds from my bank into my Dwolla account, I then bought my lovely bitcoin through campbx. All in all it took me a total of 2 weeks to actually get 1 btc and it was frustrating. But i'm very happy that i have at least one, and if your service facilitates getting btc than people like me will be very happy.
