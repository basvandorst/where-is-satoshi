institutional money came in about a year ago. [Check the wallets]( A bunch of wallets opened up with $20-$50 million parked starting around January and continuing. You can clearly see from the wallet growths this is general public investing. The exchanges don't go out to the open market each time ... they are self-contained and just swap assets in between their users. Their wallets grow and shrink in blocks.
 I predict many of them are in practice, fractional reserve and don't actually have all the liabilities on hand.

an hour? psshhh ... I've got a volatility based trading bot. These 1.5% spreads are where the opportunity is.  It sells what it bought under a second prior and then repeats. There's no fees for limit orders so it'll flip the same X btc over and over again and keeps the difference in profit. A good *minute* is 20% ... let's not talk about the bad ones though, ok?

on gdax it just needs to clear $80 million and those people can pull those bids back at any point ... many often do. The 24 hour trading volume is about $1bln on gdax right now. that price could be hit within a few hours.
edit: $40 million
edit 2: $30....
edit 3: $20... may happen soon.
and there's 10mln

I wrote it myself. Bots are mostly secret and not open source because most of them only work really well if nobody else is using them.
Also, there's a lot that goes into this. Sophisticated math, algorithms, skilled programming, days of testing, careful observation... And i still get bugs. Bugs can cost me lots of money before they are detected.
Anyway, you should go on your own journey here. Have fun.
