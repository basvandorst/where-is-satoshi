Elected officials make like $175,000. Not that ungodly honestly, it's the lobbyists and such they get them alot of money.
And I think good riddance. Them out of Washington. It stops them for fucking more stuff up. Let's just leave it shut down. We're better off!

I threw away my password 2 days ago because I thought I never transfered money to that wallet. Well I checked today before completely deleting the wallet and there was .01 btc.
Spent the last 30 mins digging through my garbage for the password. It's not much but I was so relieved when I found it.

What would be the best way to upgrade a trezor to latest firmware when I have funds currently on the trezor?

I prefer cash app now, used to only use coinbase. Less fees and faster with cash app.

Download a software wallet. Samurai for android or wasabi for Windows are good choices. Generate a wallet on whichever platform you want, and send the coins off of localbitcoins to your new wallets address.
If you want do any trading, you can send the coins to an exchange like coinbase pro.

A time preference still exists in humans. People will still need things. And humans don't live forever so they will always be an incentive to spend today. 
The deflation isn't going to be like 10% per day. It'd probably be very little. The economic system should reward people for saving and putting off consumption for the future. That's how the economy grows!

Why is inflation needed?
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:33:46
Yes. Don't send coins to anyone. No way to get them back

So price will drop soon?
