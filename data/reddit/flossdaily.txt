Since bitcoin is all about a majority of machines agreeing on transaction histories, it seems like it wouldn't be that hard for people to demonstrate that a particular bitcoin was placed into MtGox's exchange, and wasn't moved before the shutdown.
I really don't understand how that would be open to abuse.  If someone makes a false claim about a bitcoin, and that bitcoin's transaction history contradicts the claim, it should be immediately obvious, right?
Anyone willing to launder a stolen bitcoin in this situation would be an idiot, because they'd be trading out clean, usable bitcoins in exchange for unspendable bitcoins on a watchlist.
What am I not seeing?

Another lawyer checking in... fair use calculation considers how much of the protected work is copied (in this case 100 percent), and whether the use was for a commercial propose (absolutely).  
It's not as open and shut as you're making it out to be.  I think lawyer  has the stronger case.

That's not the legal test at issue.  Who's to say that the commercial purpose here couldn't be demonstrated merely by pointing to the fact that the ad is clearly designed to harm western union's money wiring sales?

That question hurts my soul.

What makes you think that there has to be a specified endorsement in order for the message to be commercial in nature?

This is actually good for Bitcoin.
