Nothing wrong with that.
If you don't lock your doors, it's partially your fault if you get robbed. Not taking steps to protect yourself is stupid, and you should be prepared to face the consequences. Theft isn't going away, so best to protect yourself.

yeah. Why are those people entitled to his money? what did they do? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:13:23
I said partially. Obviously the criminal is still at fault. But I'm much less inclined to sympathize with somebody who wouldn't do something as simple as locking a door despite basically everyone alive knowing that locked = more secure.
A lot of the time, a locked door or phone is enough of a deterrent to prevent a theft.

Mining isn't feasible for everyone. For me, buying bitcoins with dollars is the only way to get it.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:07:28
Storing your wealth in bitcoin is a bad idea. It isn't stable.
Its a good investment, but when it comes to saving and storing wealth, a savings account is hard to beat.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:54:44
is it? By us, sure. But not by the general public, much of whom don't even know what it is. If BTC is to become a proper currency, people should be encouraged to spend it, and thus vendors will become aware of it and accept it as payment.
Joke or not in this case, the concept of simply holding onto BTC and never using it is a serious issue that is very much present. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:07:48
Wouldn't the market simply stagnate since no supply = no money flowing?

Bitcoin must be viewed as a *currency*, something to be spent on items. Not as a stock.
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:24:53
Yes, but in a year .27BTC won't be worth what it is today

That's a good strategy. 
I have an investment account, but its-long term. But I still like my savings account because I can spend it any time I like by moving it to my checking account which I can do online. But If I wanted to withdraw from my mutual fund, I'd have to physically go to the branch and request a withdraw, and 3 days later I get the money in my account after I pay the 18 dollar fee.
maybe I'm too much of a bear, but I'm not willing to invest all of my money, especially in something as volatile as cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:29:32
Well yes, in theory someone could buy all bit coin that's for sale. However, as long as there are miners, more bitcoin will be made and they'd have to keep buying it.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:08:29
Or someone who wants to be in power
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:43:22
Well, it depends.
On one hand, the last thing we want would the government to have a vast share of the Bitcoins. 
On the other hand, whether the government has control of currency or not, they'll still want their taxes (which of course brings up the question, how would that even work if your account is anonymous), meaning they will accrue bitcoin overtime anyway.

oh absolutely invest money. 
however, the problem with investing, especially with high risk investments, is that if i put in 1000 dollars, i don't know if i'll have 1000 dollars next month or next year. but if i put 1000 dollars in a savings account, i can be more or less certain i'll have 1000 dollars next month unless the federal government collapses. even if the bank fails, the government has a program that insures the money.
plus, it takes basically no money to start a savings account. but many VANGUARD accounts take several thousand dollars to start. 
also, if you have a checking and savings account at the same banks, many banks will move money from the savings to the checking if required, saving the pesky overdraft fee.

it'll be worth more USD or any other currency 
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:20:42
I wouldn't advise not having a savings account. While I have nothing against investing in Bitcoin, having a savings account  is important because of the stability it offers.
Never bet all or nothing.
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:11:26
But if it isn't fiat, what is it? I would think that the not being backed by a commodity is more important.
And I think there was something about the IRS taxing Bitcoin, thus de facto giving it at least asset status.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:04:53
True, but in general, buying high is a bad idea.

Negative interest? 
I have to pay you for you to use my money?
That's Nigerian prince level.
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:34:03
Of course. However, low-risk investments tend to be more long term investments. Treasury bonds, for example, are extremely safe, but take ages to pay back (in fact, it takes so long that treasury bonds are never worth it because of inflation).
and not all stocks can be easily liquidated. for a mutual fund, for example, stocks take some time to be sold and the money to be transferred to your account (though it's common practice to keep a small percentage as "cash", to pay for fees and such without having to sell shares at an inopportune time). and i don't think bonds can be liquidated at all. correct me if i'm wrong. 
plus many stock managers have a high transfer fee. that adds up.

Ikr. I want to buy but buying high is bad business
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:45:00
that's still fiat, it isn't backed by a psychical item.
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:33:52
Isn't bitcoin fiat? It's not backed by anything, not even trust in a government like the dollar.
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:05:49
Of course, but right now BTC is at the highest price its ever been- not calling it "high" would be crazy

*drops 100 dollars*

@_date: 2017-10-14 16:20:45
I would do that if the price was more stable. The nice part about dollars (besides that basically everywhere on earth accepts them) is that its really stable. I know that what I can buy with $20 today I can buy with $20 tomorrow. 
Meanwhile, last week I had like $70 some worth of BTC and today I have $87.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:29:11
Can't wait for the next crash so I can afford to buy more again :p
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:14:04
It still can be hard, its dropped several hundred in a week
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:12:16
Wouldn't people sell when the price is high and buy when the price is low?
I buy when the price is low, which raises the price. I sell when the price is high, which lowers the price. That's how it works with stocks at least.
