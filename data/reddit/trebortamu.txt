Ah thanks.   You're right I was confused between short term  capital gains and capital gains.  Short term capital gains tax rates are about the same as income tax rates.

you made income.  if no one else can claim you as a dependent then you owe income tax.  if someone else can claim you as a dependent they owe income tax.  IRS always wins, welcome to adulthood.

that sounds plausible, if he resides in the US it is required by law that coinbase collect this information.

good point, i guess I have been talking about GDAX this whole time.  I always think of them being the same thing since its the same account credentials and company.  So all my trades to and from USD were on GDAX.

But no one dictates its value

that's just for capital gains tax... wait a year or not and you'll always owe income tax if the value increases from the time of acquiring to time of dissemination

i have traded for USD many times with no problem, but I have not cashed out or attempted to move USD in anyway using coinbase except to trade back into BTC ETH or LTC.

Bitcoin is international.  Any regulations imposed at a government level can and would be circumvented through Russia, North Korea, China.  Bitcoin should NOT be regulated.  Exchanges dealing with Bitcoin should NOT be regulated.  People need to quit treating Bitcoin like it is regulated.  Market prices WILL fluctuate if this bothers you, you shouldn't be investing.

However it could be brilliant to feed off of the stupid crypto investors who don't know what they are doing.   I mean BCH is at $1500, that by itself is $26 billion owned by sheep that Venezuela would be tapping into.

Long term hodlers are less likely to hodl at higher prices.  Your theory seems to assume the hodlers are inhuman and their likelyness to spend is unrelated to their wealth.   This is a very unrealistic assumption that goes against basic human nature.

It is ridiculous that this post is not down voted off the front page.   The ledger s nano is a great product and headlines like these falsely portray the nano in bad light to casual passer bys.  Your nano was NOT hacked.

12 can be halved, third-ed, and quartered into whole numbers.  can your beloved 10 do that?
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:55:53
Also when using sites like bitaddress.org to generate a paper wallet ALWAYS download the site to your computer and unhook from all connections.  Generate your wallet.  Print it.  And delete the app before connecting back to the internet.  Also know that there are viruses for internet connected printers that will look for private keys.  It is good to disconnect your printer from the internet as well during this process.  You can never be too careful when generating your paper wallets.

If I had an infinite improbability drive, I like to think I'd use it to brute force bitcoin private keys, but I know at some point I'd use it to  ask out a hot chick way out of my league.

@_date: 2017-09-23 12:23:17
 yes, a loss of bitcoin is perminant. However, the more that is lost the more each individual bitcoin will gain in value.   The more value a bitcoin has the less likely it will be lost. This is why you find one dollar bills and coins on the ground more than you find $100 bills.  It is very unlikely the end of bitcoin will be due to the leakage of becoming lost. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:43:19
 You can't Hodl your bitcoin and spend it too.  Eventually those with large sums will have to spend or invest.   This will help our economy greatly when this happens as these people will not be able to leave botcoin in bonds that get paid with printed money and no risk.

The only right move is buy.  And if it comes back down, buy again.  And if it goes back up, buy again.  Continuous investment during a bull market is the only strategy that works better than 'HODL', but one could argue they are one in the same.

[bitcoin controlled supply]( 
from bitcoin source on github


























EDIT: To add this fact I just learned from bitcoin wiki
* In Block 124724, user midnightmagic mined a solo block to himself which underpaid the reward by a single Satoshi and simultaneously destroyed the block's fees. This the the only known reduction in the total mined supply of Bitcoin. Therefore, from block 124724 onwards, all total supply estimates must technically be reduced by 1 Satoshi.
