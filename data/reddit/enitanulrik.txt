A bitcoin walks into a bar.
Bartender says "What can I get you?"
Bitcoin says "I'll have a beer, a plate of nachos, and a can of motor oil."
Then the goat sitting next to him gets up and starts playing jazz flute.

I don't think it will be able to completely replace fiat, but it may one day reach the same acceptance level as fiat and be considered as another kind of money by general public.

This is a real magic. I believe!

as i know that exchanges show dollar amounts. so its not about bitcoin being fixed to dollars because i in england tell people a POUND value, so its all about heling the person infront of you understand the local value of bitcoins. and nothing to do with a dollar pegged price.
another way of thinking about it. imagine the world which was more used to, which fully understood, and really grasped the 'cost of living index' then we would say bitcoin is 1.5 of COL. even if exchanges were measured in dollars or the person was chinese, russian whatever. its purely about getting bitcoin recognized in a value the other party would accept and understand.

Yes, what is unsafe about electrum?
Thanks for the input Justus!
One of the reasons i heard is that it has deterministic wallets with 160 bit seed, vs 256bit seeds in armory.
But armory is switching to 160bit, soon anyway (bip32 i think).
They say that 160bit, is big enough to make seed collisions "impossible" enough.
What other reason is Electrum less secure than armory, for storing/spending 10,000 btc?
Possibly the seed algorithm is less secure? Perhaps there are other technical shortcuts, because electrum was focused on ease of use and not security?
Is it because armory dev is more "trustworthy" than electrum dev?
I know many bitcoiners only trust gavin, and still only use the satoshi client (though fewer nowadays, because armory/electrum have built reputation).
Justus, can u send a link or describe the technical reasons why it is less private? or secure?
And what improvement to electrum do you need, to finally make the switch to electrum?

Sadly there are nothing we can do to stop the Chinese from taking over the world.

i don't know
paper wallets with cool design
a cool pendrive
you can buy a metal wallet for example(although for that you'll have to spend 0.0X)

I think we should start with something very simple, like a website just llike reddit but instead of posts and links people would submit polls/questions that everyone could vote on.
You could upvote or downvote any poll and set for how many days you think the poll should run.
Each poll would run for the average of days set.
People could discuss just like on reddit.
Later we could make it more sophisticate with ways of avoiding too much repetition with hashtags and circles of people that would get voting and moderating powers delegated to them.
I can help with testing. I can read code like php, mysql, css and stuff. 
Do you like my idea of a reddit of polls?

How aboot you cross the border because it's happening now =p

Nobody is promising you anything, you buy bitcoins to use them. A ponzi scheme is based on giving a percentage each month based in your investment.
Bitcoin is based on supply and demand.

About time we knew, I guess that is.  It's been a knowable circumstance for a long time. Just not widely known, I guess.

I think i want this service too 
But usually, they send email / notification to your smartphone (that news apps)
You should request at news provider if you really want it

Even if Bitcoin and altcoins match the volume of creditcards, we should be happy

I agree, mining is risky if you are wanting to multiply. If I wanted to multiply I would either invest or I would do loans with trustworthy people who I know I could trust to pay me back.

Twitter is a good place to face the project devs and follow news. But such policy is ruining it
