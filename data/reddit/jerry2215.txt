My transaction with a 0.0003 fee didn't go through yet either, usually it doesn't take more than 1 hour. It's been 4 hours now. Ah well. Patience

Slush posted this on the bitcointalk forums:




Today at 3pm UTC I noticed that somebody succesfully resetted the password to OVH manager, the place where servers can be managed, restarted to rescue mode etc. I promptly resetted the password at OVH to something different and I also changed password on my email account and checked that there're no other active connections to my mailbox. I have to say that my mailbox is secured by OTP passwords and I take physical security very seriously, so nobody other had an access to my mailbox. I known that password-reset feature is quite popular attack vector, so I made everything possible to prevent it to happen.
