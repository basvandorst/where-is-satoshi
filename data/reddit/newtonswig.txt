Wouldn't be here asking if I were an expert :)

Ah, security is a big concern for me. If the user base is large enough, could a proof of work system still function on 'ordinary' computers, with success being more random, than a reward of intensive grinding?

Transparency and decentralisation, why else?

Wow, okay, and how many people in the world have done it before? Would I be looking to hire from a pool of like a hundred guys? Would there be people in London, for example?

By 'protocols for wallet creation' I mean something very simple along the lines of 'you have to be invited by someone who already has a wallet'.
Limited size, I mean # of coins.
Oh, also, very importantly, I want people to be able to take back their coins once they've spent them.
I'm basically talking about keeping the architecture and screwing with the permissions in a big way.
As to 'who is going to run [my] nodes?', I have to admit that I'm not a hundred percent sure what you mean...

At the risk of being frustratingly cryptic, fraudulent charge backs won't be an issue for the application I'm envisaging.
Mining would be done by anyone with a wallet.

Ah, if I understand you, the verification would be done by miners as per vanilla Btc.

Thanks, I'll look into it!
Are there any disadvantages to a lower resource proof system I should be aware of?
