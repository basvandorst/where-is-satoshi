We are still in early stage of BTC since it is priced in $ and other currencies, in this stage there would be the need of intermediaries to get in to the system to "buy" BTC, alternatively, one could even earn BTC by doing jobs for BTC and then use it to spend accordingly.

As for the 50% failure of bank connections, maybe I was not clear. It is when one wants to link bank account to a third party service provider like google wallet / venmo; there is an option to either deposit with micro payments or the option to login to bank online to connect bank to the service provider. That is where I have seen my success rate to be less than 50% for whatever reasons of online link failure, try again errors, and then ultimately suggesting to use the micro payment confirmation methods.

"Nothing will ever be priced natively in BTC.  it's too volatile and not national to any country" That is BTC in current form. BTC is ever evolving.
 is one of many which is in testing phase. Why are you so anti-BTC, anti-innovation? Why do you like to use broken systems which have several failure cases, limits, fines and chargebacks?
Bitcoin isn't spendable many places YET. There are many initiatives rolling around the globe to make way for a truly international currency. My points are about the problems that exists today that need to be worked on, but you chose to ignore those and continue using existing broken systems that do not work for all equally.

Almost all exchange is done via a third party for escrow when changing commodity, BTC ecosystem is actually even solving that problem by building P2P decentralized exchanges.

In Satoshi's words: It can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.

It is unbelievable that some people never learn from mistakes in history, and are bound to repeat it. 
You are denying the block size issue's existence even when all blocks are full, you support the companies and their plans to create a rental market for transferring cryptocurrency which people already own,
Good thing there are people who can read between the lines and fix the issue before it is spread like a virus. Cryptocurrency offers scarcity in value in a virtually limitless digital world, there is no place for people who want to impose the age old rental market to "own" transmission pipes and collect fees, thus making the system itself un-affordable. After saying this, you would jump to the extreme and make a point about how can the transmission be free? And that's where you're exactly wrong, the pricing can be dynamic on-network. Multiple solutions to Bitcoin problems exists, Bitcoin has always benefitted when it is trust-less and the middle-man is removed, why choose an option which creates a middle-man?

Please do not change the topic and troll.
I made a point about how the core team put off the block size issue and focused on working on proof of concepts like LN. Bitcoin network already hit max capacity, which is a risk since it was never designed to run at full blocks capacity, even Satoshi mentioned that block size could be increased to gigabytes, terabytes over time.
@_date: 2016-03-09 23:24:23
I am not disagreeing against the benefits of these innovations. The bottom line is, the core team along with their advisors have FAILED the network and we are at max capacity TODAY. There are no more excuses or reasons remaining against increasing block size as a code red priority. It is time to roll back all the proof of concept code from the core clients, focus on what is good for Bitcoin, and not the individual.
Unbelievable as it is, the core wants to still play around time and test side solutions on Bitcoin live chain, and limit block size to 2MB to buy more time.

The "errors" are fixed, see my replies to riplin who brought up the same questions as yours.

See reply, just because the git code exists does not mean LN works.
Please ask yourself why was it brought up as a solution against blocksize increase when it was not even tested.
@_date: 2016-03-09 23:05:24
Upvoted, agree that the way I put it was wrong.
Blockstream announced development on Lightning Network, it does not change the fact that it is not developed nor tested, add on top of that RBF, SegWit, all side efforts pushing aside the block size issue and endangering Bitcoin, knowing that Bitcoin has never being operated at max capacity.

Vaporware is often announced months or years before its purported release, with development details lacking. Developers have been accused of intentionally promoting vaporware to keep customers from switching to competing products that offer more features. Network World magazine called vaporware an "epidemic" in 1989, and blamed the press for not investigating whether developers' claims were true. Seven major companies issued a report in 1990 saying they felt vaporware had hurt the industry's credibility. The United States accused several companies of announcing vaporware early in violation of antitrust laws, but few have been found guilty. InfoWorld magazine wrote that the word is overused, and places an unfair stigma on developers.
Via Wikipedia 
Here is how I see it: Blockstream hires all devs who are not sure if increasing block size is a good idea, alienates other core devs, announce a vaporware product(Lightning Network) and keep delaying growth of Bitcoin network which ultimately hits max capacity on Feb 29, 2016

“his proposal”, sorry, the on-chain scaling was proposed by Bitcoin developers way early in 2012 on bitcointalk forums, both Gavin and Mike Hearn were ready with a bitcoin client and tested scaling in 2015-2016

August 2017 they broke BTC by adding SegWit amongst all hooplah for SegWit 1 or 2 or X, not thinking the risks for end users.
@_date: 2019-03-20 11:47:54
again it was not him alone, a whole community finally decided that they waited long enough to resolve the scaling issue, and had to avoid adding SegWit and decided it was the right time to fork and scale on-chain, which worked perfectly against all the lies about the issues it would face by some of the core devs who even revoked Gavin’s key to bitcoin core. The reality is stranger than fiction.

Satoshi was also part of discussions about the idea of majority users might stay on a chain for sometime till they prefer the rules of engagement in an alternate chain and they would have the option to switchover.
Roger is a vocal personality, he might shine out and look like he is confusing people, but as per non-SegWit, non-artificially-limited block &gt;viewpoint&amp;lt;, Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. While Bitcoin BTC chain has the majority mining power, business logic and excitement about LN, We have to unfortunately live in this debate due to the disagreements of certain individuals in the 2015-2017 time frame.
I’d say give it time, BTC is still riding high off the pump that started early 2017, the ridiculous onchain fees and risky/crippled LN implementation is literally delaying the adoption of crypto. Dell, Microsoft, Steam all stopped accepting BTC. This is unforgivable, people in BCH camp talk about how they fired the core team in August 2017 with the fork which itself was a hard decision that would start the confusion.

Have you given a thought about conflict of interest for jack's public company? Square benefits when BTC users don't use LN as it is cumbersome to setup your own LN channel VS users just using cashapp as a custodial service. Also jack hates BCH as it can handle PayPal level of 100 TPS on-chain today, which would not allow him to become a middleman to make money from holding user's Bitcoin/cash in cashappp.

Obviously you can modify the tx on the wallet side, save them, and broadcast later.
Only when the wallet tx is broadcast on the Bitcoin blockchain, they are Bitcoin transactions.
Stop confusing people regarding LN and LN wallets transactions being Bitcoin transactions, they are not processed on-chain and they do not have the security of Bitcoin network.

Never say never. An institutional investor WILL put money in BCH when they look at its fundamentals. BTC has no technical edge over BCH.
@_date: 2019-04-03 01:13:04
Wrong. Bitcoin Cash follows the original Bitcoin protocol closer than BTC which has SegWit coin, RBF, LN capacity of 1000BTC tx only!! Both BTC and BCH are forks of Bitcoin that occurred in August 2017.
Bitcoin Cash has solid developers, multiple implementation clients vs core's single monarchy, and BCH has strong principled backers.
BSV was an attempted take over of BCH by a wealthy backer + an imposter, but they failed and are stuck with an insecure fork that gets expensive to maintain everyday.
Only time will tell when the next Billion users join crypto, and which one will they choose? BTC with its choice of higher fees than western union or using LN sidechains for receipts/tx complexity OR on-chain transactions on BCH.
@_date: 2019-04-09 10:38:57
It’s totally logically consistent, 1MB block-size can only have limited number of transactions, come halvings to 6.25&gt;3.125&gt;1.5625&gt;... the miner rewards reduce significantly and the tx fees do not increase due the choked up block size; and there is no incentive for miners to mine and secure the network. Satoshi did point this out specifically that the network will run on fees as miner incentives after the block-size rewards phase out. Now if you are going to convince people to use LN, there is no incentive to pay the miners who are spending loads of money to secure the network. This will cause the miners to mine something else that’s profitable or totally give up on Bitcoin and move onto some other privacy coin or make money on PoS blockchains.
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:09:34
lightning is not used more than BCH, check the stats [
more LN nodes = more trusted third-parties to work with when Bitcoin was made to avoid third parties.
you don't need to imagine when something becomes easy, BCH on layer 1 scaling works just fine, centralization concern is FUD with BCH and BCH is more decentralized than BTC in terms of client implementations and ideas.
@_date: 2019-09-30 13:24:46
I understand LN works for you and is dear to you. Think broader, do you really expect a Billion people to run their own LN nodes? Or do you expect them to use custodial services?
BCH on the other side is optimizing layer 1 tech which is as simple as it can get. No risk to funds getting stuck in channels or not finding enough capacity. There are so many ways BTC has blocked itself from growing that it has started to replicate the banking system, If you still cannot see it, I feel sorry for not being able to bring out the core issues.

How much does it cost you to load up your LN wallet to and from your BTC wallet when the on-chain prices are set to rise with the limited block size? (Peak BTC fee till now being ~$80)
Are you then going to start using custodial service to "use" BTC or switch to another cryptocurrency?
Do you realize that LN as a scaling solution makes everyone else(holding BTC) use a custodial "third party" wallet that holds user funds, the very thing Bitcoin was designed against? Do you realize that LN has several 0-day bugs being exploited and fixed on the go?
LN scaling approach is anti-Bitcoin network, it does not leverage the benefits of Bitcoin and instead adds intermediaries who play the role of trusted third-parties. Using BTC thus becomes Retail Banking 2.0

Lightning tech was never designed as a scaling solution in 2015, it was developed to reduce un-necessary on-chain transactions within trusted parties e.g. Amazon charging users via their credit with Amazon and paying Sellers multiple times a day. The author of LN doesn't even work on it any more and the LN White-paper was modified to a scaling solution(after deciding to not scale block size) to give rise to rent-seeking second layer businesses i.e. third parties.

This issue stems from the path chosen by bitcoin-core team in 2017 where now there are proposals to reduce block size to 300KB.
While the BCH community went with multiple node implementations ABC, BU, BCHD and 5 more all working to optimize the on-chain scaling. Computing power increases exponentially over the decades, Bitcoin can scale to all transactions in the world, while still keeping off-chain transactions to the minimum between trusted parties(layer 2 is not the answer for scaling problem).
It is your assumption that is very wrong that only 1 person working with businesses is the driver of transactions on BCH. Again, sorry, but I do not see a future where Bitcoin is limited to work with add-on software or trusted third-parties to route transactions.

Stopped reading on your point number 4.
It is not required to scale the blocks infinitely, this exaggeration is not required when solving an issue on hand. The scaling by bigger blocks solves problems faced today and the upcoming years. There would be scaling required going further, just Ike the Internet cannot even scale today for 360degree retina+ real-time video scaling for a great VR experience. One step at a time is required, but as history repeats itself(for the VoIP, telecom monopolies convinced everyone how the Internet could not handle telecom, and now they themselves route over VoIP), we have Blockstream and party pushing the core devs towards a fee market, as it is easy to hijack a small community,
Core devs are replaceable and the current ones think they are not, only time can tell when newer vision solves the issues on hand and works towards accommodating a much expansive use of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:20:09
They are not clowns, all they want is to follow the path of what Bitcoin was, and not install the SegWit code sponsored by MasterCard via PWC&gt;AXA Fund&gt;Blockstream and the core devs they hijacked to limit Bitcoin from scaling on chain.

Think long term. The block mining reward will incentivize the miners for the coming several halvenings. After that, the fees would play a majority (&gt;50%) part of the block reward.

Bitcoin is about freedom. You have a choice to follow the SegWit implementation. Bitcoin is also not about 100% agreement.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:22:47
Bitcoin is about freedom. Clients, miners and exchanges can fork off and fire the Blockstream co from their grip on Bitcoin core software and follow the path of Bitcoin to scale on chain.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:29:29
NON-segwit coin == Bitcoin. We don't want MasterCard lobbying Blocktream via AXA to limit Bitcoin as a settlement later only. Can't believe most miners don't realize they are the ones getting hit hard if they mine the SegWit coin which has deployed alpha level untested side chain software that breaks bitcoin's security model of incentivizing Miners to take block finding prize + fees. More side chain transactions = less fees = less incentive to secure Bitcoin.

With any change in the crypto eco-system, it is easy to point and scream at it as a greedy pumper. Fear not, as there is no change with the ABC client from the Bitcoin idea. It is the SegWit implementation inside Bitcoin core client which is the change, and not acceptable to many a folks in our Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:34:38
Bitcoin is about freedom. As per the white paper and vision, users choose which rules they want to follow(by updating the Bitcoin client). It is my personal opinion that SegWit is a virus to break Bitcoin incentive for miners to secure the network. Pushing transactions off the main chain means less fees for miners which breaks the Bitcoin model.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:45:56
Bitcoin ABC is not a worthless client. Thanks to the contributors to Bitcoin ABC client, we now have a SegWit code free client which supports on chain scaling. The miner will only secure their future by mining the chain on Bitcoin ABC client which guarantees that the mining reward + fee will be part of the block reward with all the transactions occurring on-chain without any third party side chain settlement operation. Bitcoin idea lives on.
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:30:25
Not yet :3
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:22:12
We are in the year 2017. People do not need to worry about available space when using Bitcoin. Bitcoin ABC makes space availability a non-issue.
It is not secret that ever since the entry of Blockstream in the Bitcoin eco-system, their team of bullies have trashed every idea in the trash can and kicked the can down the road all the way in 2017 regarding scaling.
This also shows the beauty of open source, democratic discussion. In case of Bitcoin though, it turns out the singular source of client software needs to be run by the users, exchanges and miners to follow the same set of rules. This enabled a single consortium (Bitcoin core) to smear former core devs when they did anything not aligned in the bad interest of Blockstream(limiting Bitcoin to 1MB and saying that blocks are not full).
Bitcoin is about freedom.

My reference to honesty was in terms of mining the next block with packaging the transactions from the last block in a honest way.

@_date: 2017-07-22 22:12:30
It isn't about the money invested. It is about what is their interest for Bitcoin. Bad interest has no place in Bitcoin where it is proven that in today's world there is a way where honesty can be an incentive in case of mining and keeping the chain going forward instead of causing harm.

When you think long term, the number of tx everyday in the future would dwarf the tumbling activities by Bitcoin users.
Blockstream control of core has clearly shown that it is not about who writes the softwares instead it is about what the software is about. Bitcoin is open source. The community already knows about the core dev trolls who shamed and attacked former core devs who supported on chain scaling to leave the spotlight. Good thing is that the miners are realizing their role in running Bitcoin, running the appropriate client which the exchanges and users need to update to, and not the one dictated by a singular core dev team with corporate interests.
