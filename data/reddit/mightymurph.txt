I don't blame you. BTC dominance is on the wane with plenty of alternatives working at present without the same level of fees or delays. The writing it on the wall.

Coinbase stated bch would be launched By Jan 2018. For those of you struggling with interpreting the English language, that suggests before Jan 2018.
