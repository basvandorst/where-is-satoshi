Hell yeah. CSV is no problem.
I can fetch all relevant URLs to "block size" and "blocksize" in no time. It takes literally 3 seconds.
I'll reply to your comment when the data you've requested is up.
Also when are you generally online? I'm in Australia and busy for the next few days with finals.

Updated. Scroll to the top of this post for more information.

In that case it makes me think there should be no limit at all as to how old an account is.
What do other people think? I'll re-run a modified script and upload the new data. Just let me know.
EDIT: The upvotes have prompted me to re-run the script. Expect more data in 12 hours.
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:38:38
Yeah, that's one of my hypothesis's. The other is there are a lot of presence of 1 comments which simply didn't catch on at all, that are for or against 1mb block size.
But that's why I tried to make the data as least intelligent as possible, so people can come up with their own hypothesis's and check things out.
Lastly are there any decent quick anonymous file upload services?! This is nuts. I can't find a single one.
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:29:57
Edited :) Thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2015-06-18 02:57:25
I'll have the CSV data up tonight, 10:00pm GMT+10.
@_date: 2015-06-13 09:46:05
Yes, exactly. There is actually no way to determine where the votes are coming from so I've opted for the latter :) I put in the total scores just as something else to use, even though it may not be necessary.
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:31:14
I've updated the text with a link.

That pickle file is binary Python spits out. We need a filebin-type of service!

Yo, good job man :) For some reason mentioning me didn't send me a notification...Weird.
Yeah I haven't heard back from even though I PMd him a bunch of times. A little disappointed at the lack of communication...
So I just read through your pdf and wow! Good job at actually generating some graphs to lay eyes on :) From the looks of things everything was as I thought...your heat graph though was really cool to see. Seeing stick out like a sore thumb was awesome.
One tiny thing: &gt; Code ran until Jun 13 20:28 UTC.
He wanted everything from before the bounty started...So June 10th and before that. You data includes everything AFTER that point. Oh well.
Well there we have it folks. 2/2 hypothesis's with data to support them that there is no manipulation.
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:56:29
It's already filtered. If you want to wait another 12 hours though you'd probably get very, very similar data. It's so people can avoid the (bullshit) wait.
[I've uploaded it to a new website.](
@_date: 2015-06-13 08:29:06
I thought about that. I thought about even eliminating the restriction all together. What if there is a sock puppet master who has accounts like at 4 or 5 years old?
I think it's safe to draw the line at 6 months, because it shows there was a recent attempt by *anyone* to try and inflate the debate.
There is no clear answer to me.

yous a suspect mister saddit. watch yer back. /s
@_date: 2015-06-13 10:21:02
No. I sort by their presence. A presence is user making a comment or post.
@_date: 2015-06-13 19:34:20
@_date: 2015-06-13 12:59:13
Well I was doing this for the bounty at first, because I need about 1/4th of it for an expense. But that's just it, I don't need the entire thing, it'd be greedy and keeping this work to myself is just silly.
I just hope I didn't waste my time...
@_date: 2015-06-24 08:09:25
I'll link your thread on my thread too. Yours didn't seem to get the same amount of publicity.
EDIT: It is done.
@_date: 2015-06-13 14:00:23
So far that appears to be the case.
@_date: 2015-06-13 11:14:50
I did contact you, actually.
The current script that is running as we speak is tracking the age of these accounts now.
The 1 or 20 is not a filter. It is just another simple "score" to check out.
I expect the list of relevant threads to be associated with these users.
If there's anything else you need let me know.
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:08:13
The data might not go further enough. Additionally, after looking at your account, you were not considered a suspect because your reddit account is more than half a year old.
@_date: 2015-06-13 09:24:16
Yeah that's what's cool about this script. It can be used to scan ANY sub-reddit for keywords and see what users have a high presence involving those words.
Give it a go! I'd like to see your results :)
@_date: 2015-06-13 19:26:25
Thank you! The positive comments are really brightening my mood...!
I wholeheartedly agree with you.
