I have been living in China for the last six months. Every month or so, I transfer about 500 CAD from my home bank account to my Chinese bank account. Start to finish, it takes about 2 hours. 
I use Interac to send money to QuadrigaCX, buy some Bitcoin, and sell on LocalBitcoins. Money is deposited straight into my Chinese bank account. 
Very fast and convenient, and zero bureaucracy involved in the process. My only problem is that I end up paying about 3% in various fees. This fee could be reduced to 1-2% if I bank transfered to the exchange instead of using Interac.

Let me get this straight: he was arrested because people bought BTC from him on his site, and then went to SR spent it there?
So like if I withdrew cash from my bank account and then visited my drug dealer, then they'd arrest everyone at the bank right? 
Edit: So he allegedly knew exactly what the BTC was for, and according to the law that makes his actions illegal. Cases like this are still incredibly frustrating and infuriating to read about, knowing that HSBC got off with a slap on the wrists for laundering billions of dollars for a cartel, knowing that the CIA has been caught smuggling cocaine into the US, knowing that the DEA is colluding with a cartel, etc etc etc. 
It's so fucking disgusting. How much longer will we tolerate this? It seems that no one wants to start shit because here in North America our standard of living is among the highest in the world so why do anything, right? Let's just keep being good little sheep and maybe the bankers will leave us alone for now. 
I know, I know, keyboard warrior and all but come on... I can't take anymore of these fucking lies, corruption, and manipulation.
Edit 2: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger.

The latter, the device's hash rate goes from being high relative to the network difficulty, to being standard relative to the network difficulty.

Some wallets include it automatically, some wallets let you choose how much of a fee to include. There have always been fees, but in recent years they've gotten higher due to a high volume of transactions and the finite capacity of transactions that can be included in a block.

no, he means the fee when you send bitcoin from one address to another. the fee is incentive for the miners to include your transaction in the next block mined.

yeah it is, it's already a problem. there's a debate going on  on about how bitcoin scaling should be handled. if I'm not mistaken there's two solutions, Bitcoin Unlimited (block size is reached by consensus of nodes and miners) and segregated witness (aka segwit, not too sure how it works)

That's a good way to look at it. Might as well enjoy your time at the carnival.

I've done this loads of times with Local Bitcoins. I've used a couple of guys, off the top of my head tncat is fast. His listing is in Shanghai.
