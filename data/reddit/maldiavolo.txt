1) being that the Ukraine was the grain belt for Russia when it was apart of it.  They are right up there with the US in terms of ag production 2) Russia's gas pipeline to Europe goes right through Ukraine.  Part of the reason the Pro-Russian President was ousted was because he signed an energy deal that was unbelievably costly.  The populace got straight robbed legally so they protested.  With him gone Russia has no ally.  The Ukraine has considerable economic leverage on Russia and Putin does not like it.

You didn't think to goto MT GOX directly?  You probably now have a virus.

Lol are you actually calling out a company for using what essentially is the same as using a stock photo?  You got a lot of threads to make for every company or organization out there using stock photos on their website.

I have one card mining 24/7.  My gaming card mines when I am at work, sleeping, or otherwise when I am not on my computer.

I too dream of a day when each company has their own set of infrastructure to support their individual business.   It will be amazing to see Amazon pave their own roads, build their own bridges, pay for their own air traffic controllers, educate their own workers, among other things.  This country will zing with efficiency.

The reason I gave the advice is because it's not a well designed cooling system in my experience.  The heat sink is good, but the case itself heats up and once that happens you get what is called heat soak.  The whole system simply has no ability to efficiently cool with all of that trapped heat.  Yes it will stay below their thermal specs if your ambient air temp is whatever they say it should be.  However, you if are borderline on the ambient air temp you will throttle on hotter days.  I hope that helps.

I use [CampBX](  Trades might be a little slow because I believe there are more sellers than buyers using the exchange.  Prices reflect that as they were/are a little lower than MtGox.  They have doubled the amount of users since I last checked though.

Definitely remove them from the cases.  My FPGA singles ran 10C cooler w/o the cases.
