Serious question: If this sub doesn't allow altcoin discussion, why does it allow "blockchain" discussion? In my mind, an altcoin is much more related to Bitcoin than a "blockchain" is. Maybe try replacing "blockchain" with "non-SQL-like database" and then show me how this relates to Bitcoin. 
I mean, the article itself says that the speech the article is referring to doesn't reference Bitcoin.

In this subreddit, of course. In general, no, but it goes without saying it is risky and you can lose a lot or all your money, as with a lot of 'investments' in this space, or startup investments.

Hmm American Banker is getting increasingly bullish on Bitcoin and is a voice of reason among all the 'blockchain is the best thing since sliced bread' crowd of financial industry. There was an article yesterday too that was quite positive on Bitcoin. Maybe the bankers should actually start reading American Banker for a change.

Yes! Seems like American Banker is leading some of the contrarian voices in the financial industry that otherwise seems obsessed with 'distributed ledger technology'

This is the project from Paul Szorc's Truthcoin, which others may be a little more familiar with. 
Here's one of his (long) essays about why he thinks Augur is broken:

Yes. You don't need a blockchain copy to backup your private keys.

As much as we all like to see Bitcoin to the moon, I wouldn't read too much into this. It's a guy who likely owns tens/hundreds of securities, and probably included BTC for whatever reason. We don't know his stance, how much he holds, when he plans to sell, etc. Just because someone predicted something 10 years ago doesn't mean every stock/bond/fx he owns will turn to gold. It could be part of any number of strategies. 
Let's just focus on what we're able to build with Bitcoin that was never before possible in the history of mankind, and price/value will follow.

I completely agree. However, is there an explanation somewhere by u/jgarzik as to how his thinking evolved? How did the block size, being a scarce resource by design, become non-trivial or so urgently needing to be increased again after a recent doubling already? Why is this good for Bitcoin? What are the trade-offs being considered, and why are they worth this rushed increase (did I mention, this is a doubling from the recent doubling)?

None of these 'distributed ledger technology' uses have anything to do with Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies as you know it. They just happen to have some overlapping features, but really, they are nothing like Bitcoin.
