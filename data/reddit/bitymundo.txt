Great questions Bitusher
Here you go:
**KYC** 
*level 1: email. Trading is in BTC only 
(litecoin available in about 10 days and shapeshify API is also built into the deposit field)
*level 2: email and sms verification
*level 3: email, sms and document verification
*level 3 corporate: all of the above + personería jurídica and ID's for 25% or greater shareholders.
All citizens are welcome although US citizens are subject to standard reporting requirements as per FinCen. Our KYC was custom developed for Central America. As you probably know addresses do not really exist in Costa Rica which is why our digital level 3 verification was designed the way it was. Another interesting note is that as far as we know we are one of the only exchanges that offers fully KYC verification through the use of only a smart phone. 
Our owners will be announced in our next press release along with the announcement of our next office opening (in another country)  Can't really be fully anonymous in Costa Rica these days :). 
BTC transfers are within seconds. Fiat intercountry transfers are processed each day at 12pm so for Banco Nacional customers the funds typically arrive by 1pm and for other national banks they arrive the following day. Standard 3-5 days on international wires.
Yes purchases can be made at our office in Escazu by appointment at market rate + .5 or as some of you also know we also have a cash 2 way Genesis ATM there. (no it is not on the map:) The ATM rates are 5% + a process of .5%. $10,000 max per day.
Please feel free to PM to schedule an appointment at the office or just to learn more)
