You wouldn't be able to withdraw from exchange $4 of each because of exchange fees. Or pray the exchange stays alive long enough without hack or failure to see that $4 rise above withdrawl fees :/

Really? I think the people in Greece 2013 or Venezuela 2018 would like to have a word with you. If you are one of the lucky few to use a 1st world banking system, you should want crypto to succeed so you can have insurance against the gov freezing your bank accounts and limiting withdrawals during a financial crisis (which btw they have caused or allowed to happen without recourse). Or insurance against many more darker, Orwellian situations that already happen today in the USA, but on a small scale.
Edit - sorry I realize you're talking about a guess about "most people" maybe not your self

Yep when crypto becomes a threat to the Fed or IMF you can bet there will be bans and weak hands will sell. There's no way institutional powers will not fight to keep their power, however it could be suicidal for them to try to ban or criminalize crypto, for fear of being left behind in the world economy. It would be like trying to ban the internet. Apply enough pressure and you'll have people turning to mesh networks or satellite internet. It's more likely they'll try to pivot into becoming the dominant digital currency. Then there's the 2 Billion people still unbanked and how many more don't have access to first world financial instruments? There's a thought in crypto that they might leapfrog the current system, due to failed states/corruption/other, and look to crypto for solutions. "A guy with a $40 phone can become his village's bank" - that kind of thing. 
There's definitely some shady coins that look like "wealthy and powerful big banks" where there's a few people at the top holding a majority stake of premined coins, or systems like Proof of Stake where the rich get richer, or systems of centralized mining/node power so the owners can control the future of the coins code exclusively. And definitely there's some bad actors trying to take over Bitcoin so they control the code for personal gain. This is why the future is uncertain and volatile but also why it's worth researching a coin before investing / voting for its success.

That's exactly what it means. Gold's intrinsic value comes from its properties - it doesn't rust, its chemically inert, nonalergenic, reflective, electricity conductive, etc. It's monetary value comes from supply and demand. 
One of Bitcoins unique properties is that payments can not be removed from the settlement system. This is a first in the history of money. That is a source of Bitcoin's intrinsic value. A settlement system that solves the problem of trust in  disintermediated trade, that is a source of intrinsic value. Those are properties of BTC that gives it value regardless of how supply and demand value it monetarily.

Agreed. Also I just stumbled onto peter van valkenburgh. Has some great interviews that clear up challenges regarding regulation and can go head to head in agro round table discussions.

You could look at Bitcoin as is a currency kickstarter project funded by people willing to take the speculative risk that it will fail for the chance they will see returns on their investment. It has intrinsic value from the fact the payment itself cannot be separated from the payment system, a trustless network of computers verifying transactions without the need for gov or king backed institutions to verify transactions or print more money when they commit fraud.

I've also heard it boiled down to  "bitcoin's intrinsic value comes from the payment being inseparable from the payment settlement system."

There is no removing that intrinsic value. How we value that feature monetarily... time will tell.

Thats not how this works, thats not how any of this works! The author describes the pros of using a fedcoin
* When was the last time you ever used large bills? Who uses them, criminals that's who! (war on cash)
* every transaction is public and tracked, great for catching those criminals! (and totalitarian govs!)
* "strengthening the power of monetary policy to help manage the economy." I thought he would say how the supply is limited and impossible to manipulate (BTC), but no, he envisions a FedCoin that can print more money at a keystroke. What was the advantage here? devaluing our currency *faster*?
*"it would be decentralized....but there would be centralized control over it" ...wow
An old writes article for other olds. Olds chop at the bit. WashPo makes ad rev.

Dude you have no idea how any of this works

What? Coinbase or the us economy has nothing to do with what he's talking about. Buying 100 Alts sounds like a fun experiment but it's risky to leave your coin on an exchange in case of theft or sudden instatement of KYC rules. To take it off the exchange involves paying a withdrawal fee.

The entire market is driven by speculative sentiment. All memes are relevant hah

Thats a fun symbol for Satoshi, but a 3 syllable word is an uphill battle for language adoption.
I feel like Bits will be the increment that gets used the most. Today a $4 Latte would be 1500 Bits. Pretty easy to say. And if you're Japanese, the conceptual semantics is not much different than speaking about Yen.
At what valuation would someone actually need to bring Satoshis into conversation? "Hi that coffee will be 10bits and 370 Satoshis" I think we'd have to go way past the moon for that to happen heh.

Please go do the math on how much hard currency exists in the world and compare that to 21mil Bitcoin X BTC Value and see what kind of numbers you get. You don't want to live in a $100k BTC world, that implies a lot of 1st world collapse. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:11:10
No, just no. That means there would be 7.35 quadrillion USD in Bitcoin. No. So much facepalm here.

Some ATMs don't require ID, and given the cost of the Fee in the grand HODL scheme of things, I'd say that's worth it

A $5 coffee right now could be labeled as:
* 5 USD / 549 JPY
* 0.00189471 BTC
* 189471 Satoshis
* 1.89 mBTC
* 1,894 Bits
If bitcoin ever gets to a place where it's actually widely accepted in coffee shops, my guess is you'll say "bits" if you say anything at all. Things will still be labeled as in fiat though and that coffee could be $30...

You're assuming a 100,000 Bitcoin only if you're thinking in dollars and need your sundry purchases to be valued in 2 digits only. If you're thinking in Japanese Yen, then you're already paying 1000s of yen for a coffee. That's 4 digits. "Bits" is fine, it's easy to say, short and sweet.

It instantly updates on your phone wallet, then the confirmations take 30-60min. In the wallet you can choose if you want pay for faster or slower confirmations.
