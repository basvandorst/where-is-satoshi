Equity valuation models cannot be used for Btc.    
At one time, I was frustrated like others who traded in legacy markets.  But there are interesting articles about this topic.  Try searching for "bitcoin valuation".  Good luck.

Hmmm... I don't see the...  
"link to submit a post literally says "NOT about price."    
But will re-read rules.  No worries.

That's a new one.  Maybe Arthur got tired of "system overload"?

Awesome - thank you
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:26:25
Apologies.  :(  
Help out a new guy with a link?

Good to know - thanks.

Wonder how many "Goxxed" are still waiting for their coins.

We're up about 170 pts from severely oversold conditions.    
Let's not get too excited though, bear is still alive (until it isn't.).  
Short term?  Great to finally see a green candle.

Without knowing specific accounts, can't say.    
Who knows what the acct size was, leverage, entry etc...

They obv weren't shorting bottoms.   Or did I misunderstand your question?

If she bought at $20k, she fomo'd long at top.  
Now if same person now says "it's over", she's probably selling bottoms.
People like that are worth fading (counter-trading) if other indicators signal a bottom.

$400??  I know someone who's still waiting.   Should call him and ask.

How about non-phone based hardware solutions?    
I'm not an engineer, but I think we're in early stages of hardware too.  
Sky's the limit if the tech is allowed to grow imo.

We frequently saw walls over 1,000 btcs in 2017.
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:10:33
Did she buy at 20k?  If yes, we should buy now.
@_date: 2018-12-17 15:25:02
Hope this doesn't cause too much of a problem.  Guess I have to read the rules again?

Also BTC 1 yr ATH anniversary present!  :)  :(
@_date: 2018-12-16 20:58:34
I could def see btc (or another coin) easily outperform Apple or Google Pay.    
Imho, mass adoption will be more influenced by global regulations, not the tech, etc ...  
If "powers that be" feel threatened, they'll do anything to kill btc/crypto.

No way!  No implants for me!  LOL  
The day they force me to get chipped, I'll join the rebellion.  ;)

Gotcha and in retrospect it's my fault.  Won't make the same mistake twice.

Just meant to show that Spoofy was much more active last year but def not gone.
