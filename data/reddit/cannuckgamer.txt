Keep applying the pain.

Definitely will hit $27,000 by Christmas.

I second this. Thanks for bringing this up u/SeekingHeaven!

I should've bought when it was $200. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:24:11
Makes me want to see more.

Can't foresee McCafe eating his own dick anytime soon. $500,000 here we go!
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:18:24
Sorry, but what is this other sub you're referring to?
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:37:55
I was going to add the words "I'm now going to punch myself in the face a few times", but that would've been seen as too dark and/or self-destructive. I just sighed after seeing it rise to $3400, shrugged my shoulders, and told myself I should be happy for Bitcoin. In fact I'm both a fan &amp; believer in a currency that's not controlled by any one government or corporation. It's a currency of the people, by the people, for the people of Earth. Bitcoin serves this purpose for the people of Earth, so keep rising Bitcoin! Rise, and destroy the other fake (fiat) monetary enslavement systems around the world!

Wish I knew what was truly going on.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:22:52
It looks like some sort of disinformation war is going on. By who or whom is just a matter of finding out who would benefit from either strategy. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:39:27
And this is why I don't understand anything. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:41:24
Looks like you dodged a bullet there OP.
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:15:20
Damn, time to buy!

Oh well... I was hoping it would reach $100,000 by mid-summer this year when I wrote that post a few months ago. You see, I'm all for crypto-currencies. I don't own any, but the reason why I like them is because I hope crypto-currencies destroy the current "fiat" system (by decree), as I feel our fiat system is a system of debt and enslavement. I still hold out hope for bitcoin and all the other coins to reach new heights by this summer. I think there's a lot of manipulation going on that's hurting crypto-currencies in general, by that manipulation is being done by the "old guard" (those who currently control the system). For now it's a "hold &amp; wait" game. Stay strong and stand tall. :)

The more the better. The financial systems of old need to be done away with. Long live crypto currencies!

What's a whale?
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:11:52
Thank you, I didn't know. I guess the "whales" are the real players in this game.

Clench them holes!

You keep your current coins, and buy some more (that's within your budget).

He was given "assisted suicide". Probably didn't want to give up the codes to unlock a safe or server vaults.

My sentiments exactly. Almost finished my build but the only thing I'm missing is the video card. Just wanted a decent card but all the ones I want are either out of stock or resellers have priced them up exuberantly high.

I hope all those crooks at the Fed suffer from their gross incompetence.

Darwin Award contender. The less the merrier we all are. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 00:16:11
Wow, this is scary how the system screws people who worked hard for their coins. :( 
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:28:09
He was "suicided". Reminds me of Hillary Clinton's list of many people "suiciding" under extremely mysterious circumstances.
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:07:56
Oh my God... what happened??
