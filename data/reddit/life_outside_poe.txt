Uhm, it had mass media attention at the end of 2013 when it hit 1k as well. I remember because it was on TV non stop. They even had a Bitcoin price running along the bottom during morning television...

And that's different to the end of 2013 how?
Plus then you also had the biggest loss/hack of Bitcoin in history to really instill some confidence in the market. /s

Unfortunately right now the value of bitcoin has NOTHING to do with its practical applications. Which is my whole problem with cryptos right now. People are viewing them as a get rich quick scheme, rather than a viable alternative. Obviously it doesn't help when the value goes up 1000% in the space of a year.

This is wrong. Adoption assumes absolute or predominant use. I would argue that there is no one who truly uses bitcoin /crypto for all their day to day and puts all their money into crypto.
Owning a bit of crypto for the sake of a speculative investment is very far removed from adoption.
If anything, adoption should be measured by the number of service providers accepting bitcoin as payment, which effectively will determine the longevity of crypto.

Your argument is based on the assumption that it will keep climbing and climbing. The problem is that it might not keep going up. For all we know BTC will crash massively in the next days/weeks/months (or it might not). It's not viable as a currency if it can fluctuate in value by more than 5% a day, let alone 20%.

Didn't the Mt gox fiasco precipitate the bitcoin crash of 2013/14? The whole cryptocurrency thing was a lot more unstable back then. I seriously doubt it will ever crash that hard again. 30% drops sure, but no way 80%+. It's way too established and people know it can pull through again.

Except its survivors bias. Bitcoin has gone up so of course they'd say it's a good store of value. Had it crashed because of a fatal flaw etc they wouldn't be on the news saying "sorry guys, the whole bitcoin thing wasn't as great as we thought".

all of it?

Isn't that exactly what you're doing here with bitcoin??!?
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:12:17
But they won't. People who are buying now are buying because they saw a 1000% ROI in a year. They're treating it like any other investment. Which unfortunately is not good for the general usefulness of cryptocurrency.

However you'd be silly to think that Steam/Valve would solely go off what people say and not look into it themselves and their bottom line

I did have a question about something similar though? If BTC is meant to be used to buy things online etc, who in their right mind would do that? Especially in the current climate? A $10 pizza could end up costing $30 tomorrow. Lets say you bought a $1000 laptop with bitcoin. Suddenly your $1000 laptop cost you $3000. 
Surely to become a real currency, it needs to stabilise before people use it as such?

I laughed at my brother in 2014 when he said bitcoin could reach 10, even $50k. He kept his 10btc, bought a shed load of ether and now has way more money than me, even though I've saved for the last 15 years.
