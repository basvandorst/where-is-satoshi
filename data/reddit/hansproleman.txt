Bingo. It only has value if the market believes that it does. There's little to no practical difference between BTC and many other coins except first mover advantage. Some alts are more technically accomplished, but their fundamental value is still zero because, ultimately, it's all just data which is only worth anything if markets value it.
Fiat doesn't really have *fundamental* value either, but governments say it'll buy stuff - that's as good as it gets, aside from the gold standard, for money in general.

It's not a crime. These are unregulated markets so it's part and parcel, you should expect it to occur and factor that into trading decisions.

If you honestly can't figure this out for yourself, you should probably avoid crypto investment.

The DNMs don't quite use BTC as currency. It is/was the most convenient crypto proxy. If those transactions were legal, they would be conducted in fiat.

So long as you are prepared to, and can afford to, lose your fiat investment then go wild. The problem is in investing more than you can afford to lose.

How do you *know* that's his motivation? If you believe in BTC fundamentals, it shouldn't matter anyway - BTC will recover and continue appreciating.

Insider trading is a *certainty* in unregulated asset markets where insider information exists. Market participants need to decide what the lesser evil is.

Investing all you have is never "doing it right". It may pay off, but that doesn't make it a good investment decision.
