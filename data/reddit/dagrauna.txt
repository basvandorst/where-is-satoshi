OP, this is a hard lesson, I took a huge blow of more than 200 BTC trusting the wrong people.
but they will never get my bitcoins online like this. Im my own bank and I make sure to have them on coldwallet.

only reason I dont add to this or further bountys is I dont want my money going to some charity out there. I have my own way to help people in need. If we cant catch the thief the btc ought come back to my address.

Im not a native english speaker and reading this I realized the following: Millions of non english speakers depend on the work of subtitlers to enjoy that juicy movie or series. Altough its mainly a volunteer ocupation they usually release their work very fast after each episode. True heros.
This is surely a good way to spread the word. There are big subtitle portals in Brazil with a HUGE audience that could start a very interesting donation loop. Well, I guess I have some convincing work to do.

remember, blockchain.info is only one of many block explorers applications that query the blockchain, the big database of bitcoin.
anyone can do this kind of query in the database if they want, these sites just made it easy for you, and they do it in real time.
first you need to know the address you are sending to, then go to a search for more info.

Too bad mercadobitcoin used his trust to break Brazilian early adopters legs, one of the reasons why Brazil is behind the curve.

That means the growth rate of transactions is 0.3transatcions(or simply tx) per second, each year.  The actual bottleneck of the network is 7 tx/sec.  Search for bitcoin blocksize for more info.

You cant digest Bitcoin even you try to eat it.

A brazilian CS scholar, most respectable critic of Bitcoin. He claims to be doubling his bitcoin savings everyday since the day he got acquainted with it. I like him.

 - List of Major Bitcoin Heists, Thefts, Hacks, Scams, and Losses [Old]  
Can you explain why your exchange is listed here? You are major scammers in Brazil and hope you keep saved funds to honor what you stole.
To everyone else:  
Use with caution. This exchange is in fact being prosecuted and will probably face serious problems with the authorities very very soon.

I believe Gangster Town, Master System is a better fit here. Shoot a random brick, get a key. Bitcoinland is no kid`s playground.

you are saying, before anyone does it, they can buy lots of bitcoins with their infinite money?
@_date: 2015-10-01 21:06:07
After that its still a computer. Use it where you see fit. Upgrade it to a piperwallet, whatever. Its a raspberry and a flash drive. You can do infinite things with it.
