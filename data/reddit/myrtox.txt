Who's trying to stop them?

Reddit was only a small part of this. Groupon shit down comments to their Facebook page due to the backlash.

Honestly nothing,  but I'm sure it will happen at some point. And before they do,  there will be meetings,  and somebody will buy before the announcement.  I was curious as they would be using non public information.

See, that would make sense, if I didn't currently have a credit card, that I can completely use online, that automatically came with my account. 
So far you have been wrong so many times, that I can't tell if your an idiot or a troll, but either way I'm done with this. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 01:13:34
Well, the government did at least. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 01:37:24


Yes I do. No application required, at least in Australia, I got a card sent but by my bank, arrived a week after I opened an account.

What's it matter if your in rehab though? Sure it sucks if they relapsed, but its not a bar tenders/bouncers job to manage peoples will power for them.

Guess what changed in that time?
@_date: 2014-10-15 04:40:25
Really? Because I fucking do all the fucking time you idiot. Google, Amazon, Steam and even Reddit gifts all accept it.
Here's an interesting fact, Americas payment system is a joke compared to the rest of the world.
Next take don't make statement you don't know a thing about.

The problem is you think the value of an episode is 25p, the industry strongly disagrees. 
@_date: 2016-09-19 23:38:27
I 100% agree, but I do realistically think that sweet spot is still higher than 25p. If we were to push prices lower the middle man (Netflix. Hulu, Google, Amazon and Apple) needs to be removed and the creators, including big studios, need to sell directly.

Uh, no, war is funded by people who want to find it, dollar, euros or bitcoins can all fund war.

And can do all that for free as well as provide powerful APIs and services for free...

Not because they are not bound by the Google Play developers ToS, I know you are trying to make a point, but at least try to do it intelligently.
@_date: 2015-02-13 07:33:43
Uh, in the Windows store they do all the time...
@_date: 2015-02-14 11:48:21
Best buy also don't buy complex APIs and services that are also played for from the 30% revenue they make. Best buy provides 4 walls and a roof. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 11:50:49
Yeah, but Google wants its cut of those. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 11:46:37
Awesome story, but this entire post is about Google Play.
