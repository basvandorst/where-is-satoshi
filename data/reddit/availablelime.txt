Part of me feels like anyone who has the minor sophistication of knowing where to find and how to use a bitcoin ATM, would know not to send their BTC to those agencies

should be way bigger for bcash to symbolize the humongous blocks that solved all of bitcoin's "problems"

The tax situation for crypto is beyond brutal. On top of that, every agency is fighting over Bitcoin and all alts to roll up under them in an awkward power struggle that makes it painful for all of us, so i hear you loud and clear. I also agree with your point about the small merchants that support BTC payment. The only people that would pay on Amazon with BTC are ones that are likely sophisticated enough and knowledgable enough to know which vendors support BTC or wheret o find out who does, im thinking using BTC for amazon purchases just isnt that great anways- coupled with the privacy comment from [nowitsallgone]( and im not that psyched on it anymore. This was my first time coming across the project and didnt see much written about it on reddit so figured i'd ask, and as predicted you all knew what was up with the project, thanks for the insight

Using Satoshi's name here is sort of lame. Satoshi's treasure is much much more. And his design is giving away tons more btc than this as each block is mined

Also- thanks for the insight!

This is very good- that third link under ecurrencyhodler's post looks like primary source and is pretty damning. Thanks for sharing\^\^

This is really disheartening. The ethos of preserving privacy in the crypto world is something that should be held in high regard, not tossed out there as one of the primary ways they can think of to make money. There's a constant assault on privacy anyways, so to see them let their CTO go (the one who seems like he gets it) to move forward with a shitty approach of just selling out people who are supporting and using BTC is a massive letdown. Oh well, we don't need paywithmoon anyways
