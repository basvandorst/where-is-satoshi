Bittybot is not an exchange. All it does is list the prices and places you can buy it. It links through to them. 
Bittylicious.com is probably the most painless place to buy but the premium can be high. 
It's P2P like Localbitcoins so you're paying someone directly via faster payments. You usually get the coins within a few minutes. 
If you want to do exchange trading, completely forget GBP. The markets are tiny. Buy Bitcoin with GBP first and send it to a USD or EUR exchange and start playing there.

Electrum is a little trickier than other wallets as it usually uses a different seed method. 
When entering the blockchain seed, click on options and check bip39. Then your coins will show up. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:37:07
Of course it works, it would be alarming if it didn't, but like I said you have to take that extra step with Electrum that you don't with others.

For a computer Electrum's the best.

@_date: 2017-03-15 02:44:33
The fee is decided by the amount of separate inputs that makes up what you're sending and it's nothing to do with the amount. 
The extra inputs make it a larger amount of data for the blockchain to process and there's 1mb every ten minutes to fit all of the transactions in. The data is what costs. 
A $1 billion transaction with one input would cost less than a $5 transaction with more. 
The fee has been reduced in the past after Bitcoin went up a lot - 
It may be decided to do that again but who knows? It kind of feels unlikely at present. 
If you trust the site paying you you could let the future payments pile up on their ledger and send a large amount in one go if that's possible.

I genuinely couldn't give a shit what form of work is taking place. All I care about is a chain that works, is secure and isn't being coerced by small minorities. 
I also don't give a shit what happens to miners as long as there are other ones who are ready to pick up the slack if it morphs. 
I didn't ask them to stake everything on very narrow terms that everyone knows are changeable. 
Maybe it's time they were reminded that they provide a service to us and we should be deciding what service that is. 
However, a mooted PoW change might drive wavering miners to BTU, but that also makes the case for disposing of all of them stronger too as it's pure self interest at the expense of a greater good.

Casascius buyers won't be interested in a CGS rating, only ANACS.

It's the laws and your USD that's the slow part. Bitcoin can't do much about that. 
Look into the Gemini exchange if it's in your state. Transfers should be faster and there won't be a similar buy limit. 
Coinbase is a buying service. Their exchange is GDAX. 
As for wallets, blockchain is only as secure as your computer. Look into a hardware wallet like a Trezor or Ledger Nano.

The monetary element is what separates Bitcoin from any comparison to software, be that the clapped out Myspace/Facebook comparison and this as well. 
The thing that creates the real value is the history and trust Bitcoin has. That transcends versions of software. 
If enough people choose to place that trust in a different form of the software that builds on all previous transactions then that's Bitcoin. 
It's not as if the Bitcoin of 2009 bears much resemblance to the version of today other than the shared history and interoperability.

There is no incentive for a consumer to use Bitcoin at present unless they bought for far less.

@_date: 2016-06-19 00:45:30
They won't be currencies, they're digital tokens for existing currencies. 
That'll make banking less painful in general but won't do anything to address what Bitcoin does like inflation and debasement and so on. 
They'll also make Bitcoin look even more like the answer if they attempt to push all money onto it. They'd be able to trace every single one of your transactions and shut you down with one press of a button. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 01:46:24
That's my take on it. And it's by far the most obvious one. I dunno where people are getting the idea that governments are going to spew forth a bunch of their own brand new currencies and that they'll all be 51% per cent attacked and traded on Yobit. Let's have some reality. 
They like their present currencies and they like the idea of Bitcoin's tech giving them an even tighter grip on them even more.

Are you off your trolley? A vast amount of the alt bubble was financed by these fun tokens and most of bitfinex's volume.

So does this mean I could use Litecoin on chain transactions to open and close channels and then transfer them to Bitcoin channels if necessary?

@_date: 2017-08-09 23:56:30
Tether is USDT which is a token tied to the US dollar which is in theory redeemable for 1 US dollar. It's what Poloniex, Bittrex, Bitfinex and many others use to avoid real banking and compliance costs. 
Here's their terms and conditions - 
BFX is still the leading USD exchange, even though you can't get USD in or out. 
It doesn't have to be the whole market to lead it. Gox had a big hand in the 2013 rise despite its market share decreasing. All markets have leaders that others follow. 
If USDT turns out to be backed by nothing and Bitcoin was bought with tokens created from thin air then the rug is pulled from a huge portion of the market instantly.

It's one thing to execute Segwit, something that's been around and tested exhaustively for over a year and is operating on other coins.

They have every right to reject it if turns out to be a piece of shit, which it may well. They're going to run something that risks everything they've spent years building up because they feel obligated? Nope.

Why would they fail? They'll find a way to make the tokens irrevocably redeemable. It won't be vastly different from current electronic banking, just faster and cutting out all the clearing house crap.

@_date: 2017-08-03 17:17:42
The reason for that giant trough will of course never be known for sure, but the main culprits are - 
Ridiculous over exuberance in China that pushed it over $1000 from under 100 a few weeks before and spread elsewhere. When the Chinese government saw it that was starting to be used as a currency they forbade banks and businesses to touch it. It crashed after that. 
Mt Gox - This is a swampy one, but the theory is that Gox was buying on its own exchange with funds that didn't exist that pushed up the prices elsewhere. 
Gox was also hacked hugely between 2011 and 2013 and hundreds of thousands of coins leaked. The sale of these might have contributed to the suppression of the price for so long. The BTC-e closure was partially related to that.
Gox then died and took an awful lot of money with it. In the early days it controlled 90% or more of the bitcoin markets. 
Chinese exchanges - exchanges were allowed to stay open after the 'ban' but only for trading purposes. They were zero fee so millions of trades could happen every second. 
This led to relentless price suppression because the West slavishly followed the Chinese exchanges despite it all being illusory. They really took charge of the market in late 2013 and continued for several years. 
All the Chinese had to do was let the West rise, then dump and they'd all run screaming and the Chinese would buy up cheap again and repeat. This continued endlessly. 
When the Chinese zero fee exchanges were shut down the price started to rise and here we are. We wouldn't be here if they still operated.
At least that's my take on it.

This type of thing means people will simply bypass it. I've seen talk of those reckoning people will pay $100 fees for censorless payments.

I don't think it's a question of safety, it's a question of the perception of safety. 
The number of true Bitcoin believers is vastly outweighed by the skittish kiddies who dump at the first sign of trickiness. 
That means either they have too much skin in the game, or they're non believers and probably both.

They absolutely should not be falling for stupid crypto hype whipped up by a bunch of teenagers and anonymous pumpers on a couple of exchanges. 
If ETH had been running smoothly for 3-5 years then it would deserve some serious attention once it had proven itself. It hadn't and it certainly hasn't now. It should've remained a non monetised research project until they could be sure but greed won out as ever and plenty will pay the price.

Stripe US will be a different proposition to Stripe UK but both will be defined by what banks they can get on board. Stripe is a quasi Paypal desperate not to offend their banks. They have no power of their own. 
In the UK even Coinbase has to bank in Estonia. There are no exchanges that don't require foreign transfers. Literally no bank will offer an account in the whole country, but Coinbase might secure something.

This guy is in the UK. UK banks don't want to play. Stripe depends on the banks.

I don't have any use for such an expensive system nor do the overwhelming majority. It's not a failure of Bitcoin, it's a failure of the people involved. I'm not interested in subsidising miners who are forcing an artificial situation on me. 
At some point someone else will come up with something which corrects all of the mistakes Bitcoin has made and be genuinely usable by the masses. 
Bitcoin's still small enough to be left behind in such a scenario if it brings in more real people. And it sure as shit won't be ETH. 
99.7 per cent of the globe doesn't care a jot about Bitcoin. It's not too big to fail and it would be heading down a dead end if it refuses to accommodate more. 
They're welcome to have their consensus to never change. No one outside will care and will simply bypass the 2.7 tps paradise. If Bitcoin's incapable of responding to the real world then it deserves to become an irrelevance. The rest of the world won't bend to its will.

You get all the forks. The private keys have been doing nothing since 2011 so everything that's forked since will be available. 
It'll be down to you to retrieve them all individually with different wallets for each chain. Move the Bitcoin itself before you do anything else. 
If you're paying in BTC and a significant premium in BTC I'm not sure it's worth it. I can't see the premiums going up. Error coins have gone from 5-6 BTC to 1.1 BTC for the last sale.

I presume when they came out in 2011 and BTC was $10 or so the postage alone would've been another BTC. 
I bought a silver and gold 1 BTC coin from him. It was one of the very last he sold in December 2013 a couple of days before he announced he was shutting down. I paid 1.3 BTC. It's super cool and I for one will never regret that. 
I certainly would if I'd paid 5-6 when they were at their peakiest on the secondary market.

Tether may well be fine, but many seem to be hugely underestimating the effect it can have. 
You can claim 5 billion in volume. The vast majority of that is not new money. It's the same money sloshing around. 
Similarly BFX is usually a market leader, other exchanges follow its moves. 
That gives Tether a doubly geared effect. New money on the most influential exchange counts for an awful lot more effect than stagnant money on a second tier exchange.

Gold doesn't give me a boner I'm afraid. 
I'm fucked if I'm putting any money into something that experienced its last all time high 35 *years* ago inflation adjusted and still hasn't returned. 
I'm not buying paper gold. If I buy physical then I run the risk of it being fake. To mitigate that I have to buy from a recognised dealer. To get rid I probably have to do the same and fund their spread. 
No one will accept it as payment for anything. It's too unsafe to carry it anywhere. 
People say 'well it has 5000 years of history'. Yup. In another 5000 years we probably won't even be biological beings any more and the whole concept of finance will be an odious memory.

In China they build their own machines and negotiate discounted or even free power and house the mines in dedicated warehouses near power stations.

Weird stuff like Lastminute gift cards can only be spent on flights and hotels and not holidays. 
Ryanair used to be on there and you could only spend £50 each flight and you had to call a special line. Virgin trains was another weird one that restricted the spending to certain routes. 
Give them all a read before buying or you might end up with a card that's useless to you. 
The big stuff like Amazon is straightforward.

It doesn't matter if money arrives via different routes, it's still human nature and that never changes. 
New tech. Excitement. No one knows what to do with it. People create a load of shit to glue it to. Excitement drives the shit to crazy heights.

Tether at present is functioning fine. The agitating about it has gone quiet. 
As demand for Bitcoin is a fraction of what it was then there's no reason to create any more. 
If it does go pop in the near future then it'll be at a price where the impact will be much less catastrophic than had it happened at 20 grand.

Probably. The difference with banking is that at least you might have a chance to freeze or reverse transactions and lock all the unspent money. With crypto once it's gone it's gone.

Buying and selling would move to P2P and there would still be enough believers for it to have some demand.

You're right to be wary and extremely acute to have figured out that this is the biggest threat to Bitcoin's price short term. 
The only way Tether can be converted to USD right now is to sell it to some other mug on Kraken's USD/USDT market. 
This means Tether themselves have effectively washed their hands of backing it and are leaving it to private individuals.

I just don't see how it's going to happen. It's going to be same problem as the Winklevoss one and any other.
The SEC has the power to approve things like this because it also has the power to police the markets they're traded on. The two abilities go hand in hand. 
The Bitcoin market is still beyond their control and thankfully always will be. 
Even if they want to, there'll be rules they're bound by and that's one of the most fundamental.

If it carried on along their preferred timeline they and Bitcoin will be left in the dust. Unsexy but true. 
While they're pontificating the finer points, an army of twitchy kids will be running elsewhere. 
There's a vast disconnect between users and them. They may well be right. It doesn't count for shit if everyone else walks away. 
95% Segwit was their offering. It hasn't worked. They need to find another way for it to attract adoption. Barry Silbert's offering is an opening. They need to take it and run with it.

That was the Chinese exchanges. They had zero fees so the same coin was sold millions of times over per day. 
All the moronic media outlets quoted China as taking 98% of Bitcoin's trading volume because of this.  
If there was a zero fee exchange in Guatemala then that would be the world centre of Bitcoin trading. 
The Chinese exchanges relentlessly suppressed the price with dump after dump for years. 
When they were shut down in that form and forced to add fees they turned out to be a mirage. Then withdrawals were stopped and they're now borderline irrelevant. 
Most of this rise is thanks to the real world taking control of the trading.

There's this -  but I've hardly ever seen a mention of its use in the wild. 
Another thing you could do is buy a physical Bitcoin like a Casascius coin and send your coins to its address. It'll probably wreck the premium if you add more, but it'll also be a disincentive to cash out as it involves a physical process to redeem it. 
Or you could encrypt a paper wallet and send yourself a future email with the password but that's fraught with the possibilities for failure.

The only problem will be if your bank has kittens as UK banks have serious problems with Bitcoin fans. 
I would suggest looking into opening a separate bank account to save potential closure hassles. 
Fidor UK is the only properly crypto friendly one and there are cheap SEPA transfers to Kraken. 
You could also look into using Coinfloor's brokerage service which might be better for large amounts. No faffing around with markets.

USDT was never a dollar. It's a token and according to the wording of their terms you're giving up any right for it to be redeemed as a dollar when you take it on. 
"Once you have Tethers, you can trade them, keep them, or use them to pay persons that will accept your Tethers. However, Tethers are not money and are not monetary instruments. 
They are also not stored value or currency.
**There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money. There is no guarantee against losses when you buy, trade, sell, or redeem Tethers.**"
This will ultimately be yet another Bitfinex/Ifinex rape. I don't understand why people continue to give them chance after chance. 
Nothing pegged to the dollar has ever survived for long. This is no exception. I would never have gone anywhere near it even if there weren't these problems.

I think in this day and age Fidor to Kraken is the cheapest option. 
Other than that wait for less hype and often the premiums on P2P places like Localbitcoins and Bittylicious fall radically. A few times they've been cheaper than exchanges.

In terms of alt only that's the least offensive and sketchy in my opinion. 
The team is publicly identifiable and the support is considerably faster than Poloniex. I got fully verified on there a few weeks back within 48 hours. It took 12 weeks on Poloniex. 
Poloniex has the volume though, but I wouldn't be too happy leaving decent amounts there. I wouldn't do it on Bittrex either though. 
It all depends on what your man is trading. If it's ETH/BTC and a few others he has some properly legit options.

All Bitcoin wallet types, yes. Dunno about alts. It's the network itself that decides the acceptable fees, not the wallets.

They're all much of muchness cost wise. Xapo waves the first year fee I think.
Regardless of the company it's branded with, it seems all GBP cards are issued by one company in Gibraltar. 
Xapo cards convert the moment you spend the Bitcoins, most others fix the total deposit in GBP when you send the Bitcoins.  
I have a Bitpay one too and that does that. 
If you have someone older available it might be prudent to do it through them instead as they're all very twitchy about compliance and they'll freeze you. You'll be controlling the card anyway.

When you get the Ledger and fire it up make a note of the seed. 
Don't do any transactions and note the first address that comes up. 
Wipe the Ledger and restore the seed. Double check the address is the same and that'll tell you that the seed is good. 
Then you can send coins to it. 
If you continually add to the balance you're adding more and more inputs. That's going to make sending coins out very expensive with fees the way they are. 
You're better off piling up coins and inputting them in one large transaction if that's safe and practical.

I read about it in early/mid 2009 on an anarchist forum. Did I do anything about it and become a mining mogul? Erm, nope.

Fine. 
I was signed up for a few signature campaigns on Bitcointalk which often paid over 0.1 BTC a week, occasionally  0.2, thanks to the low price so it eventually added up to a very nice salary in retrospect. 
There were also multiple alt opportunities around at the time too which would be paying off stunningly around now.  It was a good time to be around. 
It almost seems too easy looking back, but many people would've cracked. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:56:52
Yes. You might not like the fees, but it's still a painless way of testing it. 
You may have more than one address as you've received and sent. Note all of them before wiping and check they all match when restored.

Your fee is 5-6 times too low. If they're never confirmed they'll return to your wallet eventually.

The communities will be the Bitcoin one and the other will be Bitmain and its employees. I don't call that much of a split.

quickest option. only sell to a long established trader with hundreds of feedback. they'll do a faster payment to your bank account. 
you might possibly regret selling in the years to come. that's only £70 ish now. 
sign up for localbitcoins. get the deposit address up. 
download mycelium to your phone. choose cold storage option. scan the private key QR code of your wallet, scan your deposit address, send 'max' or whatever amount you want to sell. 
job done.

No matter how much the ICO touters feel they're on the cutting edge and shouldn't be paying attention to those dumb old law things, the people with the guns and the power to put them in a cage are not going to agree with them. The clock is ticking.

I still don't get this. Litecoin can do everything BTC can and more. With greater use and functionality, the more users, the higher the value. Why would I want to go back?

Mycelium devs, just introduce a paid version with a few bells and whistles. I'll happily pay. It's a great product.

If you'd bought in late 2013 you would've had to wait over  three years for it to be strange and easy again, by which point you're so battered nothing feels easy again. Don't get too euphoric.

Awful. But his call for personal account insurance from the personal end is 100% unviable. And I wonder how good Coinbase's insurance is for themselves. It hasn't been put to the test.

It is for me.  It might have taken well over a week for any money to arrive there.  Certain people were waiting two or more weeks and there's not much comeback if it goes wrong.

Yup, it's capital gains in which case you may as well hold raw Bitcoin. However it might involve much less banking ball ache receiving the profits from an HL transfer. 
It's beneficial for pensions. I don't have one.

That's kind of saying everything and nothing. 
How and when it's deployed is the big question. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:09:56
1 - yes. it's an address like any other. watch those inputs though. if there are too many the fee to empty it will be horrific. 
2 - no. it only creates bitcoin addresses. check the individual coin's community. some will, some won't have the possibility. almost all should let you just write down the private key from a wallet which is the same thing effectively. make sure you do that firmly offline.
3 - look into hardware wallets. some of them support multiple currencies.

It's not possible to exchange through Revolut. 
All you can do is get price exposure to Bitcoin. You can't deposit or withdraw it. 
If you're in the SEPA zone the better option would be to buy on an exchange like Kraken or Bitstamp and send the coins to a wallet you have full control of.

Yes they will. They see more dollar signs. That's what attracted 99% of people to Bitcoin.

Right on. Because Bitcoin 'investments' have been such roaring successes, no? 
I can think of at least, um, errr, lemme think about it...
Two or three out of several thousand?

A few dirty letters and the odd prosecution and everyone's 'investments' instantly become worthless. No exchange that isn't btc-e will let them be traded.

He can't do anything unless you hand over an idea of what that password was and he plays on variations of it just in case you forgot a part.

Bitcoin fees are decided by the amount of the data you're sending, not the monetary amount. 
Each time you deposit is an input and that adds up to more data to send out. A $1 equivalent transaction with 10 inputs will cost more to send than $1 billion with 9 inputs. 
Google the coin you're interested in along with 'paper wallet' and see if they've made a generator for it. 
It's still the best option as it's 100% offline if you do it right. 
I don't know anything about Maidsafe. Perhaps it is somehow linked with Bitcoin. You'll need to look it up.

How was he to know how the practicalities would fully play out? While satoshi was around it was all so tiny it was easy to remain a visionary. it's a bit harder when there's real and constant pressure from all angles. 
Hopefully something will come along that fully nails micropayments,  dunno if LN is it. until then it's the decentralisation that's constantly under attack and needs to be preserved before anything else. I'm not sure how well it's doing right now.
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:35:20
It was never $2 billion. Market cap is utter bollocks. The price is set by a few thousand coins on exchanges. 
You can buy a $10 billion rise in market cap for the bargain price of about $5-20 million.

You don't need to do anything fancy. 
Write the seed down on paper. Note the Bitcoin address that the Trezor creates and don't do any transactions so there's only one. 
Wipe the Trezor and input the seed again. If you have the same address it's all good. 
That's assuming you haven't put any coins on there. You haven't without testing the seed have you?
