I was actually trying to see if it could be done with bitcoin because well lets be honest there is a sea of cryptocurrencies out there that a lot of people don't care about.
Btc its the most popular by a wide margin.

I found this argument at SE bitcoin:
*Folding work is not compatible with the required properties of the work that needs to be performed for bitcoin. In particular, the computation work required for bitcoin mining needs to assure:*
*(a) difficulty of getting a 'good' result*
*(b) ease of verification of a good result once it is found*
*(c) precise scaling of difficulty depending on total network power.*
*The folding problems provide neither assurance of difficulty nor are in any way easy to scale depending on network power (since each folding problem is unique). They probably do meet the (b) ease of verification, but not the other criteria.*

Give me a break, I'm living there and you got no clue, the kind of shit people have to put up with here has no parallel with the US or the EU.
Example: you can't import shit anymore so we are stuck with the worst computers, phones and tablets all at a price easily 3x that of other countries.
And don't get me started on doing business here, its a nightmare

Man, even with stolen processing power the ASIC is cheaper? are you kidding me?

I can totally see tangible goods being more popular specially for those who mined/bought bc cheap and can now turn that into a new laptop, a car or even a house.

Have you been over here? because I been over there and there's no contest, in terms of fuckups the Arg gov wins by a landslide

Don't forget fuel: most planes are very thirsty, and VTOL planes are particularly fuel inefficient.

I know, but a lot of people when you say "flying car" think of the BTTF or bladerunner types which are VTOL

Dude seriously, you wanna trade? cuz I'm not balking at that
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:42:59
Ok but what if we were talking about millions of clients (PCs and other devices) mining in this network?
@_date: 2014-08-04 18:50:01
You mean first world countries? I doubt it, I seriously doubt the US could ever fall this low, not that it isn't doing badly now or that it never did any terrible mistakes, but the level of idiocy of the Argentine leadership is epic, and every new regime manages to outdo the last.

Real coming soon? or "flying car coming soon"?
@_date: 2014-08-19 16:12:16
But couldn't you divide the task of mining along several clients in the same way folding does? Sorry but I'm having difficulty seeing the difference between the two

THIS, thats what I meant, so it can be done? its not impossible like the comment above said?
