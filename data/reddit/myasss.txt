How might I do that? Sorry if I sound dumb, all of this shit confuses me much more than I care to admit.

Gotcha, thanks. Is there any wallet that won't shaft me like that? Cold storage wallet? Or are high fees inevitable?

Quick question. Bought a small amount of bitcoin a while back. Had it in electrum wallet. Just sent it to coinbase. It was some .0056 bitcoin. Now in coinbase I received .0029 bitcoin. Is it really possible that there was a 50 dollar fee to send a $100 of bitcoin from a wallet? Kind of annoyed, I would not have sent it if I had known I would lose half of it. Any way to reverse it?

Correct. I just bought a small amount before my bank could get verified. Wanted to play around with transferring to a wallet and such, didn't realize the fees involved and then I forgot about it and bitcoin has near tripled since then so I wanted to send it back to coinbase in case I decided to sell it since I've been too busy to dive into bitcoin much.

I set it to the lowest setting? It said there was a mining fee and the usual 2mbtc fee or something along those lines. If you set your own fee, wouldn't everyone use the lowest setting? I guess I just don't understand. 
So I just lost 50 bucks for nothing? Not mad, just trying to learn so I don't do that again.

Hm I selected zero fee. Still got shafted. Oh well I guess.
