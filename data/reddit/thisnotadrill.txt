The battle between anarchy and structure continues unabated.

I still remember the day that the Bitcoin network volume reached 1TPS.
A distributed, trustless, redundant database with no dedicated pipes performing this feat was astounding.
Scaling Bitcoin, IMO, is in the top 3 hardest Computing problems we have.  (After AI and Quantum)

I just did a 15 minute skim and holy crap that was epic. 
I dug the "Diff" blocks, liked the parallel validation and then "pow" (pun intended)....Extension blocks.  If you guys can pull that off....

Well done.
I can see it in on the "All Seeing Eye".

This should be the new Rickroll.

Nightmare?  This bloke has some pretty lame dreams.
A "real" nightmare would be:
Satoshi moves coins to the Cryptsy exchange and swaps them for Dodge Coin.  At the same time he successfully double spend those coins on the Bitcoin chain.  He then proceeds to out himself and publishes photos of himself goat.se style.

Only one of those is a real asset.

It's like there is a mysterious invisible hand smacking people upside the head when needed.

Paid $0.30USD to shift $100USD.  Took 3 blocks before 1 confirmation.
That's still cheap for a ride on the "one true blockchain".
We love you Satoshi.

Every member of my family and close friends has a copy of a KeePass file.
My son and my lawyer has the password.  The lawyer does not have a copy of the KeePass file.

I bought a VIVE this Christmas using Bitcoin via the Living Room of Satoshi.  Paid 1.3 BTC.
Been spending about 50 BTC per year since 2011

Which is based on the assumption of Moore's Law.  
Moore's dead.  Now what?  
Changing a constant does not an O(n) make.

Spooner was an incredible individual.

Excellent news and reaffirms that Bitcoin utility is driving price not speculators and traders.

I literally just sent a 0.12 BTC transaction with a 5 cent fee and it was included in the next block which occurred within 3 minutes of broadcast.  Electrum rocks.  It is my go to spending wallet.
PS:  I still freak out when I sweep keys into it.  I stare at the screen for ages checking it.

The corollary is that if the Pirate Party does not win, Bitcoin will crash.  Right?
