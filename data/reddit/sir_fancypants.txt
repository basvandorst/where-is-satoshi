Or, at the very least, properly flair them so that those who aren't into them can filter them out.

On the desktop using RES, or most third party Reddit apps, like Sync, support it natively.

I would say the difference is that the use of sock puppets and vote-rigging is to cheat or break an established system, whereas this encourages that behavior *by design*. I ask earnestly, what are the overall objectives of using such a system?

It's a shame this is being downvoted. Whether you agree or not with the overall goals, this is a really interesting application of the technology. Of course, I'm not sure how they'd deal with the growth of the chain, considering the exponential volume of GIFs.

Crypto doesn't necessarily mean BTC though. I think it's far more likely we'd see EACoin, Ubicoin and the like, as it would let these companies further control, constrain and profit from all aspects of these purchases.

I find this post perfectly embodies how much of the Reddit Bitcoin community now takes itself way too seriously. That ad was created by the pioneers who were really passionate about it long before it achieved any kind of public relevance. It was lighthearted and brought curious people to the sub where helpful fans would take the time to answer their questions. We could definitely use more of that around here and less constant fighting and vitriol.
