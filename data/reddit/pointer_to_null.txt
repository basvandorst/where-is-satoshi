Greenwald has stayed out of the US and lives in Brazil, and IIRC has some contingency in place. The docs are all digital, and I'm sure he's stashed plenty of copies with plenty of people. I'd say that Greenwald is probably nearly as wanted by the US govt as Snowden is, except for the fact that he's a journalist and not a former NSA contractor, and thus more difficult to successfully prosecute him (due that pesky "freedom of the press" clause).
But that doesn't mean they don't harass him. The US seized his partner at Heathrow when he was making a connection flight between Munich and Brazil (travelers take note: if you're wanted by the US govt, avoid the UK), and confiscated all data he was carrying claiming it fell under the Terrorism Act.

Satoshi is a time traveler confirmed.
That said, if I had the ability to go back in time, I would do a lot more than corner the market on bitcoin.

I bet the network got hacked and the wallet was suddenly emptied.
Then the IT guy resigned in embarrassment, then disappeared overseas.

I was one of the fortunate few who paid cash for my little jalapeno. Got it six months after they promised too, managed to mine just over a bitcoin before the market crashed and made it unprofitable. While it was advertised at 5 Gh/s, mine actually pulled in 6.5 Gh/s.
Here's a [pic I made]( testing this little sucker for the first time, disappointed that this noisy little box was barely profitable at the time. I mined by stashing this old laptop and the ASIC in a spare room, only to occasionally check on it from time to time in case the software crashed. I only regret not continuing to mine after the BTC crash caused it to become negatively profitable.

That's the joke.

I'm currently on mobile, but if you google for "bcmon Android crack wifi" you should be able to find a number of tutorials. You'll need to be rooted, install bcmon and allow your device to scan and collect data for an hour or so (depending on the speed of your phone's CPU), but it's doable.
Don't use WEP- it's horribly insecure. If your router supports it, opt for WPA2 with a strong password. If your router only supports WEP encryption, get a new router.

People still use WEP? You can crack that on any rooted Android phone these days.

If Trump wins, I'll eat one of my kid's halloween snickers. Not allergic, but that's about all I'll commit to.

Tried. They closed off access to US citizens, and won't let me validate my account.

Same here. :(

His messaging may have matured to provide ample doublespeak to keep regulators at bay and investors from fleeing, but his actions- and by extension, his company's- haven't.
It might be important to remind our friends that he personally owns the majority of voting shares in his company. He has absolute control, so every misstep his company has made- from video content leeching, sharing datamined user data with advertisers and groups like Cambridge Analytica, selective censorship of its users- these are all things he had no moral or ethical concerns about at the time.

I really hope this catches on. I'll call it bitchcoin from now on.

I'm hodling, but the beer is now flat, stale, and worthless- unlike my BTC.

Same. I "cashed out" during the pump a couple months ago, and exchanged it for free btc.
Centralized authority (with a CEO, no less!) defeats the original intent of bitcoin. Add the delusion of and the Bitcoin tweets ("BTC is the fork! We're the OG bitcoin!"), and any sensible person will want nothing to do with it.

That does a disservice to cheap Chinese knockoffs. More often than not you'll get something about as good for a fraction of the cost.
