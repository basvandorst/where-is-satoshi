It's all fun and games until the power goes out.  Then you're stuck outside in the rain.

Maybe for huge conglomerates with many subsidiaries?  They might need to track how money flows to/from their various operations.  Maybe the home office doesn't quite trust the overseas office?  How about auditing firms splitting a blockchain with client firms to keep the shenanigans to a minimum?

Long live Bitcoin!

Not sure gold is as useful as you say.  I ran across the following parable at [

Me too.  Prevents hoarding.  Allows "lost" bitcoins to come back into circulation.

Also the *worth* of a bitcoin is set by what people are willing to trade for them, not by some algorithm.
It's the release of bitcoins in circulation that's controlled by an algorithm.
Author needed to do a little more research.

If most money today is [debt]( (negative value), then wouldn't a bitcoin, having no value, be worth *something*...relatively?

The exchange rate for USD to GBP is about the same as GBP to BTC.
Just seems odd for BTC to be stronger than the pound

I'm one.  I lost both of my bit coins.  But since I haven't spent any actual money on my coinage, I'm not too pissed.  I do feel like a jackass for having lost them, though.  My passwords are now changed.

He's at least doing her right.
@_date: 2011-11-25 21:06:48
Stronger is the wrong word...I was looking for something meaning trading at a higher price.  It just strikes me as odd that a bitcoin costs more than pound.

3rd paragraph, 2nd sentence:


I said "value", author said "worth".  Meaning roughly the same thing in this context.

Hi mom, here's a 12 word seed.  Write it down and keep it next to your birth certificate and SSN card...it is THAT important (eventually).

I use Satoshi for the smallest divisible chunk of a bitcoin.   milli and nano for the larger divisions.  We could bring back some of those old British currency units (in name only) for various other divisions...farthing, ha'penny, penny, tupence, shilling, groat, florin, crown, guinea...be all good fun.
