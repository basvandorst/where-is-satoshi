[ETF won't be coming this year](
Frankly, odds are it won't be coming at all with it's present proposal. And while we're at it, bubbles *can't* occur if they're anticipated by the majority of consumers.

According to the lawyer in charge, well over a year.
According to sensible people, never.
Also, never and I mean NEVER, trust this subreddit with a question like this which could legitimately impact your financial future.

The batch 1 avalons had significant wear and tear upon arrival. They had dust built up in the from weeks of use. Here's a thread where people complained about it, with pictures.
Presumably they've gotten better at covering their tracks.

It's far easier to DDOS 1 exchange rather than 10. If there were 10 exchanges, each with an equal market share, no one would notice if one or two of them went down.

It sounds like you're doing it backwards. Going from Camp BX to Dwolla.

Why do you keep making these posts? Do you think your little posts are gaming the market somehow?
I messaged him in his last post. With his *other* brand new account. He's not selling anything.

Its a combination of the April post bubble burst which may mean many months of a slow decline in value, and the short term news that Mt.Gox is opening up withdrawals for the first time in weeks tomorrow(which speculators worry may lead to an exodus, or may indicate a more serious problem on the part of Mt. Gox).
The better question is why you don't have any idea. Both of these issues were predicted long ago. Most sensible people should have seen this slump coming.  Unless of course this subreddit is your only source of bitcoin news, since people here very rarely upvote bad news and when they do its filled with apologies and naive assertions. I reccomend visiting bitcointalk.org if you want slightly less one sided speculation.

Well there was a rise at the start of this latest Mt. Gox drama as people bought bitcoins there only to sell them on other exchanges. Bitcoin's price depends entirely on what Mt. Gox does tomorrow. If they follow their two week promise I think confidence will be restored and we'll see a meteoric price rise as people rush to cash in on cheap bitcoins and some of the better news we've heard this week(Winklevoss and hinted new features in development) will have their expected benefit.
On the other hand if Mt. Gox can't allow withdrawals tomorrow, I'd expect the price to at the very least stagnate, and at the most continue their downward trend. 
Pay very close attention to the news for the next day. These are the times when fortunes are made and lost.

My guess is that once we hit rock bottom, the price will level out and ever so slowly recollect itself as bitcoin falls back into its niche as a drug currency. And a few months down the line when its looking better, it'll still be scoffed at by those who remember this, and not allowed to catch on anywhere else.
Bitcoin isn't going to get a second chance in the public eye. The mainstream populace who just heard about bitcoin in the past few weeks has just had their worst suspicions confirmed for them. The majority of the mainstream financial community is probably feeling smugly superior having predicted the crash. The few who were brave enough to venture into the market have been burned, and won't want to touch the fire again. They'll take the advice of their colleagues and consider bitcoins to be a scam for which they fell for. So there's not really anyone left to invest for a major rebound to take place. 
You only get one shot in the limelight. Bitcoin(or rather Mt.Gox) blew it before it was accepted by enough people to become a norm. I still think if the bubble had gotten big enough, and bitcoin had become accepted by retailers like Steam, it would have been made, and to big to fail. That obviously didn't happen though. So long term I'd say Bitcoin will stick around for the drug dealers and libertarian nutters, but never flourish like everyone hoped. New crypto-currencies may come and go, giving bitcoin a run for its money, but it doesn't really matter. We won't get our new world order any time soon.

Why would mainstream adopters who just learned about bitcoin two weeks ago(most of whom predicted this crash, and the rest who just lost all their money in it) continue to invest? You say adoption of bitcoin is increasing? It *was* increasing. Now its a stampede to the life boats. No level headed investor or merchant new to bitcoin is going to look at this crash and think "this thing is the future". 
There'll always be drugs and libertarian nuts to prop up the value. But climbing into a well accepted and established currency? Ha.

I linked my TD account to Dwolla to transfer into CampBX for the exchange. Dwolla works with MtGox too, the biggest exchange, but there's currently a two week wait on verification there.

It's been endlessly amusing watching the loony zealots in this subreddit rationalize their ideology and try to paint this as a good thing for Bitcoins.
