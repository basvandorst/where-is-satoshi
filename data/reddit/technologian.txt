I'm saying that contemporary banks could easily penetrate the bitcoin market and convince people to keep their coins in the central vault via high interest. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:15:05
Got it. I think that would be outside the scope of what we want to do.

No they wouldn't lol. Old gold banks handled fractional reserve banking pretty well for quite some time

Can you elaborate on what a game micropayment is? 
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:48:26
Do you know of any literature which expands on your points of financialization? 
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:48:08
Great idea, thanks. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:02:12
Yes, sorry. I'm not much of a gamer. I understand the concept - a user would pay for game content (Expansion, etc), but how would this be delivered? Is it normally delivered in the form of a serial code?

We figured as much, but we were afraid that if we went down this road that Coinbase might frown down upon our idea.  
@_date: 2014-02-22 05:02:44
Correct... Probably won't be as good as fiat, but it's hard to say how prevalent it would be. I wouldn't say that btc is very liquid right now in the grand scheme of things. Not yet anyway

No, it's really not cohesive. I have an android and a chromebook too. Why can't I easily access my phone's files on the chromebook? Why can't I receive text messages on my chromebook? Why can't I access the pages that are open on my android phone on my chromebook? Besides logging in to the same google account, there is no ecosystem. They are not complementary products. I can own a chromebook and have an iphone and be no better or worse off than before. Love my chromebook btw ... best thing $150 can buy considering the insane battery life.

It was overvalued.

No silly it will crash again soon 
@_date: 2015-07-11 04:48:19
Not a chance. You realize the buyer demographic here is in their 50s+ and don't want to link any transaction to their bank account originally ... which all mainstream BTC marketplaces do now days. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:32:13
Wait what? Satoshi is answering questions? I thought he completely disappeared? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:22:54
Sorry but at this point you're just speculating and hoping to get rich quick. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:23:06
Wouldn't it be 100000x easier and more effective to just put it through a digital mixer?...
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:25:42
Yep. But this is America. And in America you do what the people with the guns want

Only invest what you're willing to lose. For me it's six bucks a week auto occurring. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:41:50
If you were actually vested in Bitcoin's future you would see this as an opportunity. Yes, please continue selling....
