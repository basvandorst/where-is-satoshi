Well at that point the "market" would have deemed that Bitcoin has no value. It's similar to how other currencies work the people give it value. If no one uses/wants to use it the value will be zero.

While I can agree the use case for first world counties seems very mild. However,  think of all the countries where access to banking isn't the norm. Where funds have been frozen, stolen or declared mute. Think India, Venezuela, Zimbabwe etc. The best use case for Bitcoin isn't so impactful for those in the first or second world. 
On a more personal level, I have had my funds frozen because I have been travelling. The bank required me to let them know when and which countries I was going. This isn't difficult but inconvenient if you forgot. Don't have this problem with Bitcoin.

For your second question: Bitcoin is peer to peer so to "cash out" in most circumstances you would need someone to buy your Bitcoin.

So the guy is saying that the price will only be determined by first world countries? And the majority of use is for illegal activities - sounds like the story of the internet

Buy it off them! And use it peer to peer!

Well that wasn't the basis for the argument. It was you can open multiple so a 1:1 correlation of ln channels to users isn't accurate. 
You may choose to seperate your payment channels for local and international. Not sure I personally don't have a use for multiple channels but others might.

Liked the graphic but wanted to point out one thing. bitcoin aren't stored on your computer - wallets store keys and the blockchain verifies you have access to those funds and have not spent them. It may cause the misconception that if your computer was hacked/lost/stolen you would lose your bitcoin.

If you are with coinbase already, setup a Gdax account. You will be able to move your Bitcoin there and send to an address for free. 
As for your comment about circumventing bank fees by not using a bank. I thought that's exactly what Bitcoin was doing :). Once youve got some in your control with your own private key, then you can choose your fee!

Yea fair enough - maybe an alternative is "you control your funds, not the bank". I really do like these easy to digest info graphics

I agree that I personally don't have a reason to open multiple channels. Maybe I might set one up for funding  domestic spending and another for international transfers to family or even maybe bigger thresholds for purchasing. Other people may have different reasons though and even if I don't have a need to I can open up heaps of channels just for fun or testing? 
If you were restricted to only having one channel then yea you could maybe use it to check how many users of bitcoin there are. However, users currently can have any where from 0 to infinite channels open so I don't see how you can go the number of bitcoin users is equal to the number of lightning channels? 
It is difficult to gauge how many users there are, wish there was an easy way.

Oh fair enough, as rough estimate once there's more adoption you may very well be right!
The pseudoanonymous nature of bitcoin probably intentionally makes discovering user numbers difficult haha 
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:57:47
You can open as many channels as you like you just have to be able to fund them

Segwit is a soft fork - you get to choose if you want to use it or not. My explanation may be wrong but here goes, it increases block size by seperating the witness and transaction data into two sections - removing the witness portion at the start and appending it at the end. This frees up space for transactions to fit into the block. If you can process more transaction in one go the backlog should reduce and as a result you wouldn't have to pay such a premium to have your transaction included in the next block.
Not everyone has adopted segwit and the big exchanges are implementing it soon. Updating an exchange takes time and it would be horrible if they got it wrong. However, if you have a hardware wallet like a ledger nano s, you have the option to choose between segwit and legacy/non segwit

Wow, some of you guys are hardcore with the security. I didn't know those were options

Here a two good videos:
But essentially, everyone in the system is anonymous to each other, no one trusts each other but they compete in a game like problem that has rules that are mathematically constrained. Because everyone can come to agreement on the output, which is based on the rules, they can trust the ledger (the output).

If you would like to avoid all transfer fees - you can open a GDAX which is the exchange associated with coinbase. Send your Bitcoin there and then send it fee free to as many of wallets you would like to. You do need to validate/verify the account but apart from that not bad.
