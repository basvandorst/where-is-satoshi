Quit using google to find legitimate links, dammit!!!
Type the damn url right ONCE and you will never have to write the whole thing ever again from your device...
And if you made a mistake remove it with [Shift+Del]

It slows down my PC as it's mostly ran on Javascript, since bitcoin my computer has experienced $0 USD worth of upgrades and 97% runtime

Isn't this the same as buying .44 BTC and selling it in the "future"? I don't understand where the extra 56% of the value comes from.
Edit: Arithmetic.

Some of the already wealthy will be obscenely rich.

Not even the real Satoshi could do such thing, what he COULD do is prove he mined the first block or something like that.

Better prepare ourselves to when BTC moons!

I'm aware, it's just so damn convenient... :c
Also, mobile is only more secure 'cause of OS (Linux in my case).

I forgot clipboards could get hacked, fortunately I didn't lose almost $700-worth of crypto.

Must've been a shitcoin wallet that came with the malware, won't trust Windows ever again!

Oh yes, as a consequence I'm prepping to switch back to trusty Ubuntu on my desktop. Someone pointed to using android to make transfers so I'll look into setting up my galaxy for that as well.

Ok, I accessed my modem for the first time ever but there was no port-forwarding options on it.
Thanks for that advice though, I never thought I could log into the modem as well as the router.
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:39:59
It was almost... hypnotizing!
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:45:36
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:34:49
Agreed, got a new modem/router and same port is blocked.
CURSE YOU I. S. Peeeeeeeeeee!!!
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:18:44
Ah, I see... [You're welcome!](

That creates another paradox; if it succeeds then it wouldn't need to go back into the future in the first place since it... *GASP* Nah, nah...
Reminds me of Uber and how it came to existence after the internet, GPS, and smartphone became available. Not to mention the means of transportation.

By design a flawed coin should fail in the long run as we re-invent the banking system.
I've been fearing Segwit, and in my own ignorance I understand it may be revolutionary, but why it wasn't implemented earlier still boggles me. We are basically blind-trusting some developers and miners alike.
To this date I don't yet know who is at the mercy of whom, but everything should balance out.
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:14:23
Yeah, that was about 7 - 10 mph when he landed, he should have run **with **the wagon at the least.

Bought a negligible amount at $1856. Thanks!

Some people seem to really want this fork, i think it's come to a point where society cannot be held to a single crypto.
Much like the unfortunate "repeal and replace" debate over healthcare here in the U.S.

No one here is begging, it's like the "buy bitcoin" guy sharing his address to the public. Was that begging? This might actually encourage innovation. 
How often you change it is up to you, if I had 50 btc I wouldn't want strangers to know, so a new address with 0 balance would be recommended. Much like a throw away.
It may be a terrible idea though, thanks for your input. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:15:48
Oh thanks, by hardware wallet I thought you meant something like a spare smartphone with no internet or SMS but would verify through 2FA. I forgot those types of custom hardware wallets like Trezor even existed.
Doesn't the hardware wallet use the internet to verify the 2FA? This whole encryption thing and security is very interesting, like leaving a breadcrumb trail only you can follow.
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:09:42
Nah, about $18.56 :D
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:24:23
Yes, and the rebound is for not buying at the bottom.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:58:20


WTH does this even mean?
A hardware wallet with no internet connection that is authenticated through non-SMS 2fA on a separate device? Sounds absurdly complex, can you please elaborate?
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:57:02
YOU CANNOT DENY THE ALAMOOOOOO!!!!

WWSD? What would Satoshi do? Here's what I vaguely understand:
He will either love or hate the idea, this is where the community needs to come to terms with.
IMO if he **hates** the idea is because SEGWIT creates a vulnerability, meaning that the signature did not turn out to be redundant after all, and this is where I trust the supporters of SEGWIT with 90%, meaning: I feel there is a 10% chance there is a vulnerability somewhere.
Otherwise Satoshi may actually be **impressed** to see his creation being *drastically* improved, and thus Bitcoin wins.
