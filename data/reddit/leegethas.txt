Create a paper wallet, move coins to that wallet. Put the paper in an envelope, seal the envelope and put it in a safe place. Perhaps a few copies in several safe places. 
And I don't think you need to download the whole blockchain. Just export the keys and import them into a more practical wallet.

Yesterday I moved my bitcoins to a paper/brainwallet. Checked the address on blockchain.info this morning, still there.
Having them on a paperwallet just feels saver. When someone breaks into my house, odds are they're going to take my laptop. There are ofcource backups of my wallet and the wallet on the laptop is encrypted. But still. 
Another advantage is that my wife has something tangible, in case I get run over by a truck, or something. And in case my house burns down, I can restore the wallet with the info I have in my brain :)
[This guy]( gives a good explanation, how that works.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:05:02

That means someone was sloppy and being insecure for very different reasons than the used method to create a brainwallet. If this would happen, better retire that wallet asap.

So, the only secret here are 2 secret passphrases (that could have any length). So, again, this method is NOT security through obscurity.

* At least you would know there was an error. In any other voting system you would be none the wiser. There is no way to check your vote.
* There should perhaps be some sort of legal procedure that would deal with these kinds of errors. The system is only decentralised in a way that makes it transparent, so anyone could check if the voting went fair. The government could still fix these errors. But not tamper with the votes, since everybody would see the fraude, due to the transparent nature of the system.
Edit: Maybe something like this?
* You check your vote at home, just after voting
* You notice that somehow the vote went to the wrong address
* You return to the voting office and explain the situation
* They will reclaim you paper wallet and mark that coin as invalid. It won't be counted.
* You recieve a new paper wallet and can do your voting again.

Good point. I think these are valid issues.
Edit: It would ofcource be an option to hide the blockchain until after the election. But how to deal with incorrect votes, that's a tough one. I think people would simply have to deal with it, if it were only a few errors. As I said, at least they know. Not ideal, but better than any voting system we use today. But in case of a massive errors, or fraude, lots of people would complain and a re-election could be demanded.

That is a keen observation and would indeed be the more efficient approach. But I think it doesn't matter really much. As I pointed out elswhere, the security ultimately comes down to the chosen passphrases. If someome is stupid enough to choose, say, 
Well, I don't think we're going to argument about that. It's just plain stupid. Always choose lengthy passphrases. And don't take them from a book, or a movie, or whatever. And it will take a tremendous amount of raw computing power, to bruteforce it. It definitely won't be easy, as some people seem to insist.
My approuch has a few advantages over choosing just 1 lengthy passphrase. In the end it's obviously still one lengthy passphrase. But by splitting it in 2, the passphrase won't be just one sentence, making it harde to guess/crack. Adding the : between them also adds extra characters, making it even harder to guess/crack. And that character can easily be replaced by  or whatever. Also making it harder to guess/crack. And as I stated before, using the hash as a salt is just a way of just taking it up a notch, without hardly any efford on your side.


I don't have a datacenter at my disposal to bruteforce the brainwallets of all these so called fools, that fell for my "scam". Rest assured, I'm just a stubborn fool.
To sum it up:
* Choose lengthy passphrases and don't take them from books, movies or whatever.
* If you like, use my proposed method just to kick it up a notch.
* But ultimately, choose good passphrases!
You know what? I actually did use this method to generate my brainwallet. With good passphrases, I might add. If you are so confident it's easy to crack, go ahead :)
No, I'm not going to give you my public key. That would be too easy. Just like any other brute forcer, trying to crack brainwallets, you have to check every single found key against the blockchain, too see if you struck gold. All I'm gonna say is that this wallet holds 2+ bitcoins.
Happy brute forcing! :)

I think a specialised altcoin would be better, instead of polluting the bitcoin blockchain with massive amounts of vote transactions. Using colored coins and running each vote through a voting office/machine also prevents fraude.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:43:50
Well, not trying to be a dick. But what you say is pretty much irrelevant either. Suppose you leak your private key. That would mean anyone can harvest your bitcoins.
Keeping the key, or passphase, secret is vital to any used security method. So saying that loosing a key is a huge compromise in the security, is kind of a huge DUH! :)
@_date: 2014-03-19 10:56:08
Yeah, that is sort of the **very** short version of what I said...
@_date: 2014-05-10 13:28:35
They could. But it would make a lot of people very angry, who would refuse to use the new rules and keep usining the old blockchain, with the old rules. A fork will happen and the "new Bitcoin" (with more bitcoins) won't actually be Bitcoin, but just another crypto currency.
So, yeah. They could do that. But in reality it's not that easy. Increasing the division of all available units on the other hand, can be done very easy, without upsetting anyone.
@_date: 2014-02-23 14:28:40
But does Blizzard consider bitcoin as a real world currency (yet) 
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:46:34


True. But that also means you have to remember you added your month of birth, making the passphrase just al bit harder to remember. Adding the hash, on the other hand, does not. But it does make the passphrase twice as hard to brute force. So, as I said, why not do it? Sure, it's not perfect. I never said it was. But is DOES increase security, with little to no effort.


Well, I'm sorry for the foul language, but you just struck a nerve with the very tone of you reply: *This is just security through obscurity. Downvoting for being dangerous advice.* Just. So Arrogant. While cleary showing you have no idea what security through obscurity actually is.
To clarify, hiding your key under the doormat is a classic example of security through obscurity. Knowing the method grants acces to the key and therefore access to anything protected by the key. Now, you can accuse me of a lot of things. But NOT that.

I'm not suggesting to use the blockchain te route calls. Obviously that wouldn't work. I'm suggesting to use the blockchain the register phonenumbers (or SIP URI's) in a decentralized way. Just like Namecoin is used the registar domainnames in a decentralized way.
A solution for routing all calls (dynamically?) would be something that should be fixed with Asterisk, I guess. Or perhaps volunteers, creating trunks among eachother? Since the SIP-protocol is designed for peer-to-peer, The network of private Asterisk-servers would only serve to setup the calls. The audio-streams would go from one phone, directly to the other phone. Right?
Basically I'm suggesting to combine the power of Asterisk with the power of the blockchain. I think it would be awesome if mankind could pull off a global decentralized telephone network, where even the poorest among us could plugin and participate. Everybody could call everybody all over the world, for nearly zero cost.

Asking me to reveal a part of the key? Come on! Let your clever brute force script figure that out :)


If (and I stress the if!) you manage to hack it, sure. They're all yours. But you won't succeed. Not in our lifetime, anyway.
And that is exactly my point. When a good long passphrase is chosen, noone is ever going to brute force it. All this talk about entropy and how a random generated key is more secure? [This](
When I choose a passphrase instead of a random generated key, that might bring the time to brute force it down from a billion years, to a million years. But I'm fine with that, because I'm no longer around in a million years. And what are those entropy-thight-asses going to say when I loose my paper wallet, when my house burns down? I should have kept multiple copies? And how is that not a breach is security? I rather keep a copy in my head.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:43:05
Using a random key is always better than any kind of brainwallet. No argument about that. But as I said, the idea to be able to restore the key, in case it gets lost, is appealing. If I get this option in return of some decreased sucurity, It's worth concidering, in my opinion. The question is, how much security can be lost and still be in the safe zone?

No, not really. The hashrate is an indicator how many miners are producing hashes and how difficult it is to find a valid hash.
The more miners, the higher the hashrate and the higher the difficulty.
In order to carry out foul play, one has to, at least, match the current hashrate, in order to find a valid hash (and keep doing this) before anyone else.

Not really. All the machine needs to do is transfer yor vote to the chosen wallet. How the machine does this, isn't really relevant, because you can check your vote in the public blockchain.

Thats true. But gold isn't really suitable for spending (anymore). Bitcoin is. Also, gold has a looooong history as a trustworthy store of value. Part of that trust was build because it was used for payment, in the old days. Compared to gold, Bitcoin still has a long way to go.

By not releasing it to the public. All the mining and transactions would be done by private servers. As long as in the end the enitre blockchain is realased, so anybody can check the results. In case of tampering/fraude, it would still be noticed and provoke a massive outcry. And releasing the entire blockchain is still a lot better than just announcing the results, like we do now. So, even with the mining and transactions kept from the public, it would still be a great improvement over the current voting systems.


See above. When the blockchain is released after the voting is done, any tampering will still be noticed, because everybody can check the results for themselves. In contrast with the current voting systems, where the government just announces the results and noone can check anything.

With all this talk about brainwallets being a bad idea, why not do the following:
* Take a passphrase. Easy to remember, not too short, not from a book, or something.
* Hash this passphrase.
* Take something else, that's easy to remember. Like the name of your favorite OS.
* Put this second easy to remember thingy in front, put a : behind it, past your first passphrase behind the : and put another : behind it. And finally, put the hash of your first passphrase behind the second : Something like this **FreeBSD:Super Secret Passphrase:2a9cabd9bc30fe3ab828143918157916e632e67a87601e9d746e681c83763ac8**

Simply to beef things up, make it harder to brute force. Adding the hash of one, or both passphrases as salt will significantly increase the difficulty to brute force, while the passphrases themselves will not be harder to remember. So, why not do it? But the security ultimately lies in the chosen passphrases.
Edit: All I did was show that, if people insist on uning a brainwallet, a few simple measures can enhance the security of their brainwallet and provided a simple example. But that's just what it is, an example. People can spin this any way they want. Someone suggested to use scrypt instead of sha256. I think that a good idea, because that will make brute forcing even harder.
And for giving a simply example, I get burned and downvoted for being "insecure" by the lovely community, that's know as Reddit. Some of these little arrogant know-it-all pricks even have the nerve of calling it something, that it's not.  Well, thanks.

I think this approach is dangerous and opens the door for massive fraud. See my points for using colored coins and running every vote through voting offices/machines.

If bitcoin catches on, anyone can see those transactions forever and ever. And a name can be linked to those addresses, sooner or later. Ironic when most of those payments were probably done in bitcoin, because they though it would be anonymous. Why do people keep thinking that bitcoin is anonymous, while it's actually a privacy nightmare?

When fiat currency starts to fail, people look for escape routes. Gold and silver are often the first thing they look for. But those are not as easy to obtain, spend, divise, sell, etc as bitcoin. Gold and silver are also hard to get your hands on, when the fail is already happening (you are too late and should have bought it sooner). So people start buying bitcoin, to get out of the failing currency as fast as they can. We've seen this already happen in Cyprus. And I predict it will happen again, on a larger scale.
I think when the dollars collapses ([and it will]( bitcoin will go through the roof.

First of all, this remains unchanged. People still go to the cinema.


I dislike legal solutions like Netflix, because it's limited and restricted, compared to the illegal solutions. I also dislike paying a montly fee, regard less what and how much I watch. It's like paying a fee for WoW, back in the day. I felt obligated to play, because I payed a good deal of money for the monthly subscription. That's when I decided to quit. I feel the same about all these other subscription based solutions.
As for pay per view. I refuse to pay $8 to watch a movie in a 48-hour window (that's what my cable provider is offering).
So, I download the movie instead. And they get nothing. But if I like the movie and could donate something, I wouldn't mind donating a dollor, or something like that. That's 100% profit, compared to the zero profit, right there! It's just a completely different business model.
In the curent situation, they get nothing. There is really nothing to loose. And I tink the result will be surprising.
It's a case of the big numbers, exactly like spam works. Lots and lots of people download movies. And even if a small percentage donates, that will build up to a nice profit.
I really have no doubt this will work.
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:12:51
Well, yes. The chosen title is a bit unfortunate. But that is partially because people whining about *"we need inflation"* are making the same mistake. What they often mean is: *"We need to be able to increase the money supply, to accomodate a growing economy."* Which is true. The **effect** of increasing the money supply, is devaluation of existing money. And the effect of that is rising prises, to compensate for that. That is what we call inflation, right?
So, the true issue they want to pitch is: *"The total supply of bitcoin cannot be increased, to accomodate a growing economy"*. They are right if they mean creating more Bitcoins. That would have the exact same effect as the system we are in today, with fiat currency. But there is actually no need to increase the amount of existing Bitcoins, when we can simply divide the existing ones in smaller units.
When one Satoshi is going to cost more than 10 cents, that is going to be problematic and actually a sign there is a money shortage. But this can easily be fixed be using smaller units. The money supply will increase and the value will stay where it belongs, the rightfull owners. Noone has to be robbed. This can be done with a simple update and it won't upset anyone.
So, can Bitcoin handle a growing economy? Yes!

The internet used to be a shady place full of scumm, thieves and porn. It still is, but it is now also broadly used by everyone else, for anything normal that can bare the light of day.
Also, any technology that gets adopted by the porn industry usually wins. VHS, DVD, Bitcoin. You name it.
The fact that something is used for illegal activities, is a huge indicator how practical and usable it actually is. And that it is going to be addopted by the broad masses eventually.
It is a good sign.

* A decent passphrase still needs a tremendous amount of computing power, to crack it.
* It's salted with another passphrase, increasing the computing power need by a lot.
* It's salted with a hash of the first passphrase, doubling the allready needed computing power.
Even if someone knew the exact scheme, I really doubt it can ever be cracked by brute force. And some simple variations can push up the treshold even further. Instead of hashing the first passphrase, I could hash my email-address and use that. Hell, I could hash the two phrases and my email-address, and hash the combination of those three hashes. The idea remains simple to remember, but produces something that's really hard to crack. I would say impossible. Or at least too expensive, to make it even worthwhile.

@_date: 2014-03-14 09:14:29
Well, let me put it another way. Price is all about supply and demand. De supply if digital media is nearly unlimited. That does something with the price. It plummets towards zero. It's not me saying this, it's simple economics. Apparently Hollywood doesn't get that. They try to manipulate the supply with artificial means (DRM). But people see through that. And they don't like it. It really stimulates the *"Oh, you're trying to fuck me over? Well FUCK YOU!"* additude. Not a smart move, in my opinion. Those are your customers, not your enemies.
There is ofcourse the option to sell the product with some added value. Like showing the movie in a cinema. Or selling it in a beautifull collectors box, with all kinds of neat extra's. Fans love that! And a good movie will get lots of fans. And lets not forget the merchandising. There is plenty of money to be made.
And here is the funny part. If someone else, other than you, would do this and make money out of your work, **noone** wold argue that it would be ok. Because **that** is the realy piracy.
But for all the consumers who aren't interrested in the added value and simply want a piece of the nearly unlimited supply, yeah, it's basically rattling a tin fucking cup to get paid. These are the people who were not planning to spend any money on your movie, anyway. So, any penny you get from them is really a nice bonus.
The best strategy would be to maximize this as much as possible. Don't block the Piratebay, host a mirror! Upload the torrent yourself! The more people who watch it, the more you get paid in your rattling a tin fucking cup. Some of them might even get out to pickup one of those collectors boxes. Because, boy! Did that movie turn out to be fucking awesome!
I really don't get your frustration. You act like it's below you, or something. But I have no doubt, plenty of extra(!!) cash will be flowing in. And with zero effort form your part.

The total supply of **units** can be increased. There is a big difference between the two. As I explained it my post.
If the value of one *Satoshi* get too high, we could chop the *Satoshi's* up in even smaller parts. And sooner or later people start naming those smaller parts too. Before you know it, you'll pay 3 *Andreas* for a pack of gum. And that would be 0,03 *Satoshi*.

When I say passphrase, that kind of length is what I'm talking about. But using just 1 passphrase, even one that long, gives me the creeps. Hence the idea of beefing it up.
Edit: If my passphrase would take 10.000 years to crack, simply salting it with it's own hash would not at all make the passphrase more difficult to remember. But it would increase the time to crack it to 20.000 years. Little to no efford, huge gain in security, in my opinion.

How? HOW the fuck is this security through obscurity!? Everything is out in the open. How was done. What was used. The only thing hidden, was the passphrase, or key. Just like any good security measure ought to be. Being obscure about the used method, THAT is security through obscurity.
Sure, you might argue that using a passphrase, or using this particular method, isn't the smartest thing to do. And I might even agree with you. But do NOT say that this is security through obscurity! Because it isn't.
And let me add another thing. Being secure through obscurity isn't always a bad thing. When you have a bar of gold, some cash money, or your precious paper wallet (that isn't based on on a passphrase). You know what's the dumbest thing you could do with that? Throw 'm in a fucking vault! Because that's what any criminal is going for! A fucking vault! If your smart, you throw those things in your freezer, behind those odd looking pork chops, that have been in there for too long! No burglar will ever bother to look there.

There is nothing wrong with debt. What is a problem is too much debt. But when you create debt, you have to consider how to repay it. preferably within your own lifetime, to prevent putting all that debt on the next generation(s). Because that would essentially mean stealing from the future generation(s). This ensures that the debt keeps within realistic and manageble boundries.
Creating an infinate amount of debt with the intention to never repay it, is simply a bad idea. It will grow exponetially and eventually become an unstoppable train. As we have seen happening over and over and over again. As we can see happening right now.

Actually, this is not entirely accurate. Governments make only a very small portion of the money in circulation, by printing and minting cash. But the vast majority of all money in circulation is created by banks, when they provide loans. If you loan $100.000 from a bank, BAM! that $100.000 is created out of nothing with a few keystrokes.
But what really baffles me, is that governments takes these loans too. And pay interrest over those loans! That means that huge portions of tax money flow directly to private banks.
Why on earth do governments take a loans from private banks, that requires them to pay interrest, if they have the power to create it themselves, without have to pay any interrest? Shouldn't that be a huge saving on the budged, to begin with?
But that would encourage governments to reckless spending and to create unlimited amounts of money, you say? Well... they do that already, anyway. And the current scenario is much worse, since it involves paying interrest. Building up much bigger debts. Requiring the need to loan even more. And making the people pay private bankers huge amounts of their tax money.
This truly baffles me. What kind of evil conspiracy is behind this? Why isn't there any politician that says: *"Hey, lets greate our own bank, that allows us to create the money we need rent-free. And while we're at it, lets use that bank to provide rent-free loans to all of our citizens. Instead of having them pay rent to private bankers, we'll arrange a system that pays back the loan in X-years. That would lift a huge burden of debt from our society with the stroke of a pen!"*

So do governments. At least, any sane politician or government would want to prevent that.


So do banks. It's happening right now in the US end the EU. It's the nature of the beast. More and more money needs to be created, to pay the interrest of old loans. It will end in tears, no matter what. The idea of paying interrest over a loan, that's exactly why.
If governments could create money interrest-free **and** manage the money supply responsibly, that could very well work for a very long time. No need to create more and more money to pay interrest of old loans, until the system blows up in your face. And the government could easily controll the money supply by adding to it, or subtract from it.
Besides, Bitcoin would be an excellent means to keep an irresponsibly spending government in check. If they create hyperinfation, the people would stop using it and switch to Bitcoin.

Yes. Do you know why? It works like this:
* Expand the money supply, by flooding the economy with lots of cheap loans
* When the economy it booming, stop giving cheap loans
* Foreclosures are imminent, since everything depend on the cheap loans
* The banks end up with ownership of **real** value
Yes, it is indeed in their best interrest. Thats how their business works. It's like casting a fishing rod and reel it back in. Over and over and over again.

Didn't this have something to do with multi-signature? For example, between a party of 3 people, 2 signatures are needed to validate the transaction.
Update: [Yes, it does](

Yes, there is. It's the markets being nervous about the dreaded fork on August 1. The markets declining and the prices dropping leading up to that, is totally expected. As are the prices rising after that.

Because the amount of debt is completely spinning out of control. They can't print their way out of this. Sooner or later, a reset is inevitable. As soon people start loosing faith in the dollar, things will spiral down very quickly.

I doubt it. Open Source Hardware will probably be less powerfull and more expensive as proprietary hardware. And since most consumers don't understand and/or don't give a shit, they will go for the cheapest solution. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:05:10
Because companies aren't going to do it, so it falls to hobbyists and hardware hackers. And they lack massive funds, time, people and professional experience to compete with the big boys.
Another probelem is that developing hardware is not the same as developing software. For software, anyone, anywhere in the world can participate, with virtually any type of computer. This makes it possible to work with a large group of people on the software, for little to no costs at all.
For hardware, you can't do that. You need to have a team working on the project in a lab of some sort. And you need specialized equipement to do anything. Not so easy. 
Trust me, it has been [tried before](

Bitcoin is still growing to it's full potention, in my opinion. If it gets used as currency by everyone, the price of 1 bitcoin is going to be way higher than $1000, because there are only going to be 21 million bitcoins ever. And there are a lot more people, houses, cars, you-name-it than 21 million. But that's nu problem, we'll be paying in mBTC and uBTC instead.

As a FreeBSD user, I found [this]( helpfull.
Edit: Be aware that this makes bitcoind run as root. To fix that, do the following.
Edit the rc-script and change the line that starts the daemon to look like this.
*su bitcoin -c "/usr/local/bin/bitcoind -conf=/usr/local/etc/bitcoin.conf -datadir=/var/db/bitcoin/ -noupnp -daemon"*
This assumes there is a user *bitcoin*, so make sure of that. This also needs the user *bitcoin* to have shell-access. So, make sure you set a ridiculous password (you won't ever need it anyway) and make sure you deny the user *bitcoin* any ssh-access. To do that, edit */etc/ssh/sshd_config* and add the line 
*DenyUsers bitcoin*
That should cover the security part.
Also, make sure /var/db/bitcoin is owned by *bitcoin*

I'm not buying bitcoins myself right now, because I simply don't have $1000 laying around. I have to pay the bills and take care of my family first, you know. Never risk any money you can't loose. But if you happen to have that kind of money laying around, I seriously think it's a safe bet. According to [this guy]( there is a good change the elite also invested in bitcoin. And if that is true (I don't know that) they probably did so with good reason.
You could also consider buying litecoins. I bought a few meself last week, just before they took off too. I see a bright future for litecoin, right next to bitcoin.

This is basically shifting the hassle to buy bitcoins, to someone else.
It should be the other one around. As a promotor of bitcoin, you should offer to pay with bitcoin.

But why did the Chinese government allow an elaborate documentary about bitcoin to be broadcasted on state television in the first place? This is what got the whole Chinese-buying-bitcoin-like-crazy thing started.

I too don't like the term *globalization*. But in this case I think it's a good thing, because it's a form of globalization that is in no way inforced by anyone. It's just free trade with anyone all over the globe. With a currency that is not controlled by a powerhungry elite, or anyone else.

[Millions]( Remember, only 21 million bitcoins will be created ever. And that is in 2140. For now, we have to go around with 12 million bitcoins. If (yes, if) it catches on (and personally, I think it will) demand will skyrocket, but the supply will remain the same. Therefore the price will skyrocket too.
0.00000001 btc, will be the cents we use today. 0.0000001 btc will be the dimes and 0.000001 btc will be the dollars. I see it going in that direction. So, no. $100.000 is not that far fetched.

Haha, people keep telling me the same thing: "Sell them, before it is going down again!" However, I'm convinced the potential of a single bitcoin is huge. There is a limit of only 21 million bitcoins. And we have to wait until 2040, before that limit is reached. For now, we have to do with around 12 million bitcoins. There are a lot more houses than that. So, potentially, 1 bitcoin could easily pay my entire mortgage. I'm waiting for this to happen. For me, it's all or nothing.
