correct, this is the limitation of the card issuer, unfortunately.
However, you can still use our E-card in those countries when travelling there

thanks, mate, this is a rather long shot, but will keep your idea in mind for sure..

similar. But it's available to order and is being shipped already. Where are you based?
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:36:15
that's one of the directions we are working towards.
We don't want to become another bank, but rather create a convenient tool for bitcoin users to spend their coins. 
Would be happy to hear your ideas and suggestions, as we want to better understand what people need and implement this in our service

QR code for your BTC wallet, you mean?

How exactly do you see this, mate, and what value would it create? Interested to hear, as the idea sounds cool

If you want higher limits, there is an option to verify your identity and address, the limits will be increased considerably

*good! please, let us know how it goes - very interested to hear about your experience.
If you could also let us know how long the delivery took, would be grateful. It's normally 5-10 days for Europe, but for other regions depends on local postal service, and we are trying to compile the statistics for different countries*

*unfortunately, we can't send cards to the US, India and a few other countries. It is the limitation of the card issuing bank. This is the case for the moment though, and we will be looking to change it soon*

*the limits are set as allowed by the card issuer.
Unverified users can enjoy anonymity, but have lower limits; if you need higher limits, feel free to verify the ID and address. Both options are within all KYC and AML regulations, there is nothing below the radar.
Another option for unverified users is to order a new card once the existing one has used the limit*

*would you name a few, please? Those that are currently available and working?*
