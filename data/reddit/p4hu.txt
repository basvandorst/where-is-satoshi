Well I agree that for some LN could make sense and they could then free up some space in blockchain for everyone else.
Still as you said it yourself, it's not suited for average user and therefore it's not silver bullet like I see bunch of people thinking it is, even some developers!
I just wanted to clear that up. When I first understood how payment channels and LN works I had "aha" moment it's cool concept but LN has single big flaw. If somebody thinks of a way implementing LN without nodes needing to lock/expose their bitcoins then sign me up...
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:29:50
You are missing some economic incentives in PoS system. First off there will have be "staking pools" similar to mining pool where stakeholders lease staking power to pool.
Now, nobody cares more about well-being of currency then those stakeholders and you are completely missing that! Soon as some of those pools even think of doing something like censoring etc they will lose all staking power right away. Also if protocol needs to change at some point in time stakeholders should be only one with power to decide. We are lucky that in bitcoin miners for the most part are also stakeholders so they somewhat care but it's not the way for the future...
Bitcoin is like corporation, users are customers, miners are employees. Customers or employees should have no say in bitcoin development only hodlers!!!
Having said that I nobody is using ethereum so I am pretty sure it will not catch on, same as other PoS currencies peercoin, nxt, bitshares... Except off course if bitcoin fails to scale.

Oh first non-troll comment thank you sir! Maybe I exaggerated a bit in my rant, I don't really think LN can never be used for any purpose, as I said (imo) it will be impractical to "average user". My bottom line point is when LN is activated it wont lead to cheap instantaneous transactions without any drawbacks everybody hopes for.
There are a lot of factors to count in so we can't now say for sure who would have use of the LN and who would be better of without... I personally cant see LN beating centralized services for micro-transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-28 12:06:48
Ok I'll try to explain it to you,
1. Even after segwit transaction malleability is NOT fixed as "normal" bitcoin address are still supported and that fix is only applied to segwit addresses. Transaction malleability btw is a joke! It's with bitcoin from start nobody complained about it everyone said it's not real issue when did it bothered you or anyone???
2. Throughput is serious problem but segwit is threat to make it less not more. If segwit is adopted it will be big blow to whole "big block" community and will delay block size increase to god know what time in future... Yea it will give small increase in throughput but only if ppl change their ways and start using this new format. If segwit would increase throughput to x10 it would beat drawbacks and I would be all for it.
3. Many online tutorials will become obsolete, this change will affect and confuse users like any change would, they would now have to use new address formats they would have to investigate why that is...
4. Segwit changes bitcoin block header and makes bitcoin protocol much more complex. New programmers will have difficult time to figure out how to validate and go trough all transactions in their programs. Old programs validating blocks would have to be reimplemented or would be broken. Bitcoin should stay as simple as possible as it is today, build complex stuff on top of it.
For any fork to have sense IMO it needs to fix at least 1 big problem, but real big problem not some stupid non-issue thing like malleability or increase block for little bit.

I don't think Roger Ver is not part of the show.
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:56:09
1. malleability is with bitcoin from 2009 and it's not important issue, no user ever complained about it, no company ever stated that it prevents them from doing anything. It's not gigantic issue, block size is!
2. segwit changes whole block structure unlike bu which leaves block structure intact. Satoshi designed bitcoin blocks to be very simple, there is header with few variables then transactions and that's all, I couldn't make it more simple then that myself, I think he did good job with it. What segwit threatens to do is to break block structure completely, change block header, split block into multiple parts so that it is not enough for nodes to have block anymore, they will also need all the witness data. Users would have to learn new addresses, all wallets would have to be re-implemented/updated nothing of that is required by BU but you think BU is more complex?
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:31:06
Because BU fixes urgent problem that can't wait and segwit solves some other problems that are definitely not urgent now and would not be used in short term
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:30:06
I'm also hodler, my point is Bitcoin is not design to be communist utopia where people do work for the good of society.
In the end Bitcoin should only rely on people following their own self interest and in that process are helping bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-05 20:36:50
Do you want bitcoins to turn into cash or you need them in bank account?
If cash is good for you then you can pull it off, it's not that easy but here is how I would do it.
First go abroad to e.g. Europe visit known bitcoin atms every day and sell as much as you can (probably 3-10 bitcoins at the time). Travel trough Bratislava, Vienna, Berlin, Amsterdam etc...
Most countries have limits how much cash you can carry over border without reporting it like 10000 euro per person. You then need to assemble family members or some people you trust to carry money up to allowed limit over the border. Best would be to travel with 1-3 cars and 5-15 people.
Then you would have to repeat this few more times...
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:00:38
What are you holding now? usd or other coin?
Bitcoin still has best chances among all coins!
Ethereum has huge evaluation right now (~20% of bitcoin marketcap). I'm not expert in long term trading but selling btc and buying eth in this moment seems ridiculous to me.

Well let me educate you. CEO is just someone elected by stakeholders. Stakeholders are actually the one with power to decide everything and bitcoin have stakeholders (hodlers).
CEO of bitcoin will effectively  be the guy (or team) which majority of stakeholders support!
When they lose hodlers support they are fired similar like in traditional corporations.
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:21:34
I'm against segwit proposal and blockstream roadmap, but this guy can't be serious.
Economic majority hodlers for the most part are only thing important, miners will just follow coins with good price...
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:45:13
Yea looks like he definitely said that...
But once segwit is activated it will not allow more transactions, only after couple of months depending on adoption, how fast wallets would be re-implemented/updated, how fast users would dump bitcoin addresses (those starting with "1") and move to new address format etc. Only then we would see some increase in throughput.
@_date: 2017-03-29 03:41:55

Wow that has never crossed my mind, very cool idea whoever thought it.
Still that would not be possible with 40% they would need at least 55%-60% to realistically pull it off without losing money.

I know how LN works down to raw bytes so I don't really need explanation from you or anyone, but you can tell me what you think and I'll tell you if that is true or not. Technically LN is not very complex but nobody knows how it would work economically in real life what fees market would impose...

@_date: 2017-03-07 23:31:18
No my metaphor is more accurate. Miners don't produce anything, crops (bitcoins) will grow at steady pace whatever miners decide. Hodlers are actually the one "producing" bitcoins because each new bitcoin is released by hodlers trough inflation...
Soon as fork happens holders will be put on vote, if most sell bitcoin A then bitcoin A will have lower price and it will be strong indication where is economic majority.
As someone who spent years implementing trading bots I can tell you there is nothing wrong with it, they are helping whole community at many fronts. When user wants to buy/sell bitcoin do you think it's better for him to have buy sell spread 1250.1$ / 1250.2$ or e.g. 1250$ / 1265$? Reason why difference between buy and sell price is so close on many exchanges is because of my and many more bots competing over it...

@_date: 2017-03-25 00:10:10
I don't think compromise is possible because there is a lot of bad blood now and both sides are to far away.
BU will never fork until they are sure that their fork is what will be called "bitcoin". As long as major exchanges are with core I can't see bu fork taking place.
So when/how this could be resolved is beyond me.
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:46:23

Ok thanks for response.
Yea actually it has something like 8-9 steps my implementation was in C++ so I can easily introduce it, but still that's not the point and is not the point you to help me do that.
Point is I and other programmers now have new "moving part" on our hands, new thing we need to think about, new problem to solve...
What will happen with wallets written in different languages. What about Java wallets I assume they use Java on android.

He implies with these posts that market value Segwit more than BU which is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-03-24 07:31:32
Pfff bugs are always possible with everything I guess, but I wouldn't worry about that. I'm sure there are more pros/cons but these are what first comes to mind:
- User pay once per some period (e.g. per month) and during that period it doesn't matter how many transactions he sends 0 or million
- transactions are confirmed instantly (there is no waiting for blockchain confirmations)
- user needs to lock his funds for some period
- LN nodes have to lock their funds in user's behalf
- LN nodes have to move private keys from cold wallet and put them online 24/7 (that could affect fees???)
Difference what fees are based on: With on-chain fees are paid per transaction no matter what value is transferred, with LN fees are payed per value transferred no matter how many transactions (if you want to send/receive up to 1 BTC for 1 month fess would be 10 times cheaper then if you want to send/receive up to 10 BTC for 1 month)
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:09:10
Problem is I know how LN works both technically and what economic incentives stand behind it, what sort of fees will be required (it's not just 2 on-chain transactions), you obviously cant understand any of that and I wont blame you.
Try harder to understand or go keep on thinking how LN once enabled will work for everybody with micro transactions and large amount with zero fees...
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:08:03
No, it's not you really don't understand what bet those tokens represent.
BCU -&gt; there will be BU hard fork until end of the year, and Bitfinex will classified it as alt coin no matter what.
BCC -&gt; 
1. There can be no fork at all (Status quo)
2. There can be Segwit hard fork
3. There can be other XT, Classic etc hard fork
4. There can be some compromise between segwit and bu at e.g. 4MB
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:31:09
You are lost case but I'll reply anyway, maybe someone else reads it...


To run a LN hub along with software you'll need bitcoins, a lot of them.
Node fees market is setup so that bigger the node the bigger interest (fee) it can charge. Why? Biggest nodes, the ones most useful with many channels that can reach many/all users trough just few hops will charge biggest fees as everybody would want to connect directly to them but their resources (bitcoins) are limited.
Therefor biggest nodes would not be affordable to regular users because of high fees. Users would connect to smaller nodes, smaller nodes to bigger nodes etc...
Also for smaller nodes it would payoff to borrow their funds to bigger nodes instead of running node them self, because bigger node charge higher interest...

Why would hodlers run a node? What do they get from it?
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:47:23
They like to appear like anyone can submit new proposal. But truth is not all core developers have same weight on decision. It is very centralized process and it was proven many times if some developer disagrees with authority he gets pushed out completely.
Top authority among core devs AFAIK are the guys employed by blockstream.
@_date: 2017-03-29 04:12:42
Yea because bitcoin adoption will be school example of 
Just like with internet facebook etc when we hit critical mass adoption rate will start to grow orders of magnitude faster then before. That would last for few years and then adoption would slow down (because everybody is already using it). But I think we are still years away from reaching critical mass could be wrong though.

Can you fit 2x more transactions into block if you make blocks 2x bigger?
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:22:16


As I understood 1MB Block would be incomplete without additional "witness data" at least for segwit transactions and I saw somewhere comments that block (1MB) + witness data would result in total size up to 4MB. Is that correct?


I don't want to dig deep into segwit code there is no value for me to do that I need basics. This is the least technical issue, it's more economics - politics issue. All I know about segwit is from segwit people not bu.


They spilled block header into coinbase transaction, now whenever somebody asks for header they will also need to get header + coinbase tx in other words they hacked it. They would like to change it further:
But that si not big issue as it wouldn't affect users and wallets only full validating nodes... What will affect users and wallets is new address format.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:09:53


If transactions in block cant be validated without additional (witness) data then block is incomplete in my book.
I agree that PoW and older segwit unaware clients are not affected and not need witness data or "real" header (coinbase tx) but point is that all clients would upgrade to support segwit transactions if activated and my point stand true that block is fragmented etc...


Yes I use technical arguments to bash segwit but those technical arguments are not most important issue why I am opposed to segwit. I would swallow even worse and more complex dependency injection into bitcoin just if there is clear scaling solution that I am happy with.
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:25:09
you obviously don't know how it works and what it means to run LN hub
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:27:45
Nobody will burn money for high fees spam attack, that is just stupid excuse...
Current fees are not that high. If fees reaches certain level bitcoin will stop being used as crypto-currency of choice and will lose it's store of value function as hodlers will move to the new currency of choice.
Nobody can tell in advance how high fees need to go before bitcoin loose it's status as "reserved currency" of crypto, if I have to guess I would say 5$ but definitely at 20$.
I'm still 100% in bitcoin (stupid me maybe) but soon as I see dark markets and other business using something else instead of bitcoin I'll move to that currency as well...
@_date: 2017-03-29 04:58:35


Yes we should.


I believe tragedy of commons doesn't apply if bitcoin hodlers are the one deciding important issues.


I believe we should add support for LN as it is small change, but I don't expect whole lot out of it. I did cost/benefit analysis and I analyzed economic incentive that would take place in LN. I presume Roger is holding his private keys somewhere in cold wallet, with LN he would have to take all private keys and put them online 24/7 to serve LN users, do you think he would do that for free? There are many more factors that play in this I don't want to go into all of that. I am not saying LN could never work but IMO it is vary narrow use case (only microtransactions) and I believe for that use cases centralized cervices will actually take that market with much lower fees and better user experience, exchanges already are settling off-chain when possible, in future they could interconnect and bitfinex user could send coinbase user btc off-chain. Users will value decentralization and security for bigger amounts not for small ones.


High fees are also risk of centralization. Miners, devs and nodes will never have "real" power in bitcoin. Real power is with hodlers and if we approach centralization crisis hodlers will demand protocol change. IMO problem is that we don't have good system in place to know where hodlers really stand on this issue.

Untill now to program regular transactions all I had to import of 3rd parties were 1. sha256 2. ripemd160 3. ECDSA secp256k1 and 4. Base58 and now I would need this new thing.
I understand that I don't need to understand it deep down but programmers would still need to figure where to get implementation for their language, how to use it, encode/decode address, how to validate how to tell which character is wrong how to handle when character is wrong... It can give a headache to some existing wallet implementations.


I don't agree with this. One of the biggest technical strengths of bitcoin protocol is how simple it is. The way how block is structured, simple header then transactions and that's all. I don't know if anyone could make it more simple than this? Even very lazy programmers like myself can grasp whole protocol without much effort (at least everything around regular bitcoin transactions).
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:30:12
OMG no status quo is not 1031$.

Honestly core had it's chance to win over big block crowd. 2MB would be enough to adopt segwit, all biggest miners would jump on board just like they signed HK agreement and bu would not be a thing.
For some time I didn't saw anyone from "bu camp" offering/advocating any type of compromise so I guess compromise is not option. Core has only them self to blame, their arrogance, Luke's 300KB proposal, censorship and all the things that draw big blockers away from them towards BU.
I noticed there is no censorship here anymore but even if "core camp" do everything right now, I feel it could be to little to late.

Unlike segwit proposal bu implementation changes only block size.
It doesn't matter what some devs want or don't want. Unlike core crowd, we "big block" crowd don't look up to developers to tell us what is the best for bitcoin and we should think, we have opinion of our own and we tell devs what to implement!
We realize that many devs are incompetent to make good business decisions anyway and we don't look them as some messiah, I myself am C++ dev with over 9 years exp so I'm not hatting on devs it's just how it is.
We understand issues and we tell devs what we want (big blocks) and which ever team deliver we will support them. I bet most bu supporters don't know who are bu devs anyway and would be willing to switch to other implementation if needed, unlike core crowd that would follow core devs no matter what.
You really think BU supporters would stay with implementation that is expanding 21 million limit?

It's same thing as bitcoin code. How many bitcoin users did code review? If I have to guess I would say 0.1% but not every user has to review code so we can say it's decentralized.
We just need to ensure that
1. Anybody have access to review code at any time
2. Anybody can run node with enough resources
If any of those two would be compromised it would be detected immediately and it would take only one person to raise alarm.

@_date: 2017-03-26 08:33:05
Yea I know basics emergent consensus is about 3 variables that miners are supposed to set and that is all about block size. That should not touch anything else, users wouldn't be aware of it, wallet implementations wouldn't need to be re-implemented/updated unlike with segwit where users would need to learn new addresses, bunch of tutorials would become obsolete etc...
I am not a saying that system is perfect to regulate block size and yea I didn't look into technical details beyond basics, but it's way better then anything else we have right now... I would rather crash bitcoin for couple of hours and recover then have next 12 months at 1MB that is much more dangerous!
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:15:16
You are right, but there is a reason why blockstream would do anything else but increase block size. They were ready to lose all support before they increase to 2MB that's how strong agenda that company has.
Even if they increase to 2MB in the end after that they will continue to harm bitcoin trough block size limit and by complicating/changing bitcoin protocol so that it would be harder for any new dev to jump in. Users have to learn new address formats, all wallets have to be re-implemented/updated...

Ok I think it's a bit optimistic but for the sake of argument let's say you are correct. Let's say segwit increase throughput x1.7 then what? That increase would be eaten right away, big block crowd would take a hit and whole big block movement would be delayed for god knows how long.
Segwit doesn't solve one urgent issue that's why we should increase blocks first and make throughput x16 (not x1.7 which segwit would give). After that let devs solve whatever they want to solve...
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:45:41
Could be, that's way I cant wait to see some fork already, any fork just so we finally get some tangible feedback.
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:01:56
Problem would not be solved as segwit would actually decrease block size, as it would stall block size increase and push whole big block movement and delayed it much more.
Also segwit introduces big changes that would complicate bitcoin protocol and would impact users and wallets unlike bu/xt/classic.

No it's not, try to dig bit deeper under the surface maybe you understand it...
@_date: 2017-03-21 06:36:13
I don't think it will be optional for wallet providers or exchanges and other businesses... You can't tell wallet users that your wallet doesn't support for all types of bitcoin addresses.
Everything can work and everyone can make small effort, but I would keep things simple as possible. Drawback: users would not see where error in address is.

He has right on his own opinion but that could never make it into proposal I am sure Roger Ver, Erik Voorhees, Rick Falkvinge, Gavin Andresen and rest of big block crowd would laugh at that. Unlike core crowd that believes "devs knows the best", I noticed BU devs don't have much leverage on big blockers. If they don't deliver what we want, we will just move to other implementation like classic/xt, just like we moved from core.


This is true but it's not a big benefit. Notice that for someone to be full validating node they don't need to keep blocks just all unspent outputs and last block. If hard disk ever becomes issue nodes would drop old blocks and that history would be kept on few places. Even if let's say first million blocks are lost forever that would not affect bitcoin as nodes would start from some snapshot in the future and that would be new genesis block if you understand what I am trying to say.


Miners are encouraged to mine empty blocks only until they validate last block and compose their new block which is few seconds. If blocks are 16x bigger then they would need more time to validate block and during that time they would mine empty blocks. There are some technical advances in propagating blocks so 16MB block will be propagated faster then whole 1MB block is propagated today. Best would be if blocks are 10KB but we need to make some balance.
I am opposed to idea that miners should govern anything in bitcoin, they should just provide security. Even according to Satoshi there should be 1 hash 1 vote which is not best model IMO, any bitcoin rule change should be decided not with 1 hash 1 vote but with 1 btc 1 vote that is much more superior. I am sure miners governance will be solved easily if we get to that crisis now scaling is much more urgent.


Nobody segwit or bu wants to fork if there is risk that their coin will not be "BTC". BU to fork they first need to win exchanges etc...

Do you know how much time and effort Winklevoss twins put to secure their bitcoins in cold wallet? A LOT!
Imagine us asking them to run a LN node, they just need to move ALL their bitcoins from cold wallet and put them online in hot wallet 24/7 to serve LN users...
You think they or Roger Ver or exchanges etc would do that for free?
Actually exchanges do have hot wallets but not all balances maybe just 1% LN would require all coins in hot wallet always.
If you think these risks and costs can be avoided by multisig or some other method then you didn't spent enough time thinking about it...
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:48:42
They would feel 3$ fee more
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:38:59
Core has ~28% they would also need ~55% to attack other miners.
And one more thing, to attack other miners all bu/segwit miners would have to be on board for attack. So if Bu have let's say 75% but only 40% wants to attack other miners then it is not enough...
@_date: 2017-03-24 08:11:17
Just to correct you on one thing right away... There is one direction in LN you either send or receive never both at the same time.
Now it's true you can change direction between send/receive but each time you do that it will cost you 1 day, meaning if channel is open for 30 days you reduced it to 29 days etc...
I don't think you are seeing all incentives that play out here, I feel it is possible that LN will never be used by normal users. Why?
LN is inherently design to be used for small transactions and simply centralized services will kill LN with better user experience and much lower fees. Decentralization is not important for small amounts, not everything needs to be decentralized...
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:18:51
Interesting point indeed.
Don't worry It will be much more difficult to spam when fees reach 15-20$.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:11:53

And users always pay for it either way.

I don't know I am not convinced. I think it will be crucial who will win bitcoin brand, which chain gets to be known as "Bitcoin". As we know some big exchanges signed that document stating they are with core, others declined.
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:07:27
I don't think it can work without centralized nodes because economic incentives and we need network effect for LN.
Would you open channel (lock funds) with a 10 different users that doesn't have many channels them self and are not always online when you need them?
Everybody would seek to connect to the biggest reliable nodes (that can reach all/many users) and smaller nodes would have to pay bigger nodes market would force such a climate.
I am not saying that LN is dead it's all matter of cost and we don't know how much will LN nodes expect to gain in interest per month.
With on-chain transactions fees are paid per transaction 10 txs are 10 times more fees than 1 and it doesn't matter how much value you are transfering.
Note that with LN fees it's the opposite. It doesn't matter if you sent 0 or million transactions it only matter how much value you are sending (channel max amount). If you want to open channel for 1 month and receive up to 1 btc it will be 10 time cheaper then to open channel for 10 btc.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:03:31
Didn't saw that but It doesn't matter he still supports big blocks. Unlike segwit crowd which focus on supporting devs and whatever they decide, bu crowd has focus on issues (block size) and many don't even know who bu devs are and don't care about them as long as they give them what they want - block increase.
If there is "successful" big block fork I don't see many hodlers rushing to sell...

@_date: 2017-03-21 22:29:55
No you don't understand how LN works it's not magic bullet and LN would introduce new fees (lighting node fees). For many users LN would be effectively more expensive then on-chain transactions that's why there is a big chance that nobody would even run lighting node.
You don't see 5% of all incentives for and against LN so please stop talking about things you don't really understand.

Yes I had to import dependency code for Base58. Also had to import 3rd party code for
1. ripemd160
2. sha256
3. ECDSA secp256k1
And if I remember that was all I needed for regular bitcoin transactions, now I would need one more thing. Yes I can add new lib and that lib can be ported to other languages but it's still a "hassle" and I think it's not appropriate for bitcoin layer 0.

For me it's not about devs it's about issues. I don't care much about BU devs and I do disagree with them on many (almost all) issues just like I disagree with segwit proposal, but at least they didn't change protocol so much.


BU proposal does not change fixed money supply I would never support something ridiculous like that.


I have to disappoint you segwit is not magic solution to any of these, I know exactly what features segwit would bring and at what cost and that's the reason I am not in favor of that proposal. Some parts of segwit I agree with (placing support for lighting network) but these are biggest drawbacks I don't agree:
1. They introduced new address format, making all wallets obsolete and forcing them to re-implement/update, also forcing users to re-learn how to use "new" bitcoin.
2. Throughput increase is not sufficient and what is even worse if segwit is activated with core devs in charge we can collectively forget about next block increase as many core devs (Luke) has stated very strong opinion about increasing/decreasing block size.
3. (This is a bit more technical) They radically changed block structure, they expanded block header with nasty hack by moving header data into coinbase transaction. They broke whole block into multiple parts so that there would effectively be 2 types of blocks, block (first type) + witness data (2nd type) and off course both of these blocks are mandatory to verify any segwit transaction. I'm not saying that system would not work but IMO it's ugly and makes whole protocol more complicated without much benefit. Only benefit there is that fragmented block would propagate faster as rest of the block (witness data) can be received later, but there are much better ways of zipping block without changing whole block structure e.g. miners can send just transaction hashes (32B instead of 500B) and as miners share most of transaction pool they would already have those transactions and maybe would download just few they don't have in their pool. There are a lot of better ways to propagate block faster but segwit is very bad as it changes complicates protocol for any new devs in future.
Out of all implementations they made biggest unneeded changes and complicated bitcoin the worst, I am not sure but it's probably only implementation that went so far to even break block in 2 pieces. Bitcoin is perfect example where less is more and I somewhat understand devs that they want to do something for bitcoin, commit bunch a code, do a lot of work make some impact and it's tragedy there is nobody to tell them "hold your horses" at least when it comes to most basic bitcoin part such as block structure and addresses.

belcher_ is right I'll explain it to you...

I mostly agree all those are valid viewpoints.
Where I disagree is that I think regular users should run less and less nodes with time. I believe that was also Satoshi's viewpoint when he said that every user will run a node at first and later as bitcoin picks up only specialists would do that. While there is diverse set of node operators bitcoin will remain secure.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:56:33
No nodes should have different incentives.
Coinbase have incentive to run a node
Shapeshift has incentive
All the exchanges 
All darknet markets
All miners
All blockchain explorers
And any business that needs to be "sure" in transactions as small users like us can just trust blockchain.info and other services. Running a node should never be subsidized by the network.

That would be big node with e.g. 500+ users, nodes that have few channels would be useless.


There is no point to put 1% of your money to LN (savings account) to get e.g. 1% interest you either put all (a lot) money into it or nothing.
Also bigger nodes would charge higher interest rate that would incentives nodes to commit more funds or to lend funds to bigger nodes think about that.


It's easy for bitfinex and other exchanges to have "low" fees for borrowing while they store 99% of coins in cold wallets, LN nodes don't have that option. Also exchanges don't make much money on that lending they make money charging fees for every trade 0.1-0.2%. LN with all the risk would have to be more expensive then that.


You don't seem to be presenting any drawbacks here. Why don't you think Lightning would help with scaling Bitcoin? It allows many times more "coffee sized" transactions to happen in a trustless manner than on-chain scaling alone would allow.
More choice is always good I don't think LN can harm bitcoin in any way I am just skeptic about how it would take off and does it give enough cost/benefit so that users would choose LN over centralized solutions. Also LN has sense only if enough users are using it.


Maybe you don't but I feel most people do think it's magic for big and small transactions with zero fees.

You don't need evidence their actions speak louder then words. And their actions are:
1. Avoid increasing block size at any cost even driving large part of community and miners turn against them because of that 1 reason.
2. They pretend they are doing something for bitcoin by solving some completely non important non urgent issues like malleability and are presenting that as something important just to distract community from real problems.
3. They are perversely changing bitcoin protocol, expanding block header into coinbase transaction trough hack, splitting block into 2 types of blocks without any good reason. Creating new address format just so all wallets would become unusable and would have to be re-implemented, so that users would have to bother to learn "new" bitcoin, making many tutorials on bitcoin obsolete, making it more difficult to new devs to understand bitcoin...

No, fees are not following price like that, if bitcoin price rises 50% fees will rise something like 200%.


It will lower fees x2 or x3 at best it will not be enough and only if all users switch to new bitcoin (new addresses). In process segwit will undermine whole bitcoin by changing protocol, fragmenting blocks and forcing all wallets to be re-implemented. Bitcoin's big strength is in how simple and easy it is for new devs to understand it.


I understand lighting network both technically and which economics incentives are behind it, what fees will be required (it's not just 2 on-chain transactions) and if we wait for lighting to make economic sense for users bitcoin will become thing of the past...

Either he is lying or you are missing some facts must be one of those two.
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:23:18
I already spent a lot of time explaining a lot of aspects about LN. Ok I'll repeat just basic one but to truly understand all drawbacks you'll need to dig deeper.
Lighting network is not viable without lighting nodes that would have multiple connections (channels) to other nodes/users and would act as "routers" to facilitate transactions between users.
For someone to act as useful node they would need big amount of bitcoins (if node has few bitcoins meaning few channels it's not useful and no user would pay to connect to it). We have a lot of people with huge amounts of bitcoin which would be perfect to act as LN nodes let's say someone like Winklevoss twins or Roger Ver.
Now problem is that Winklevoss put a LOT of effort into securing their bitcoins by putting them in cold storage, they had some special computes to do that safely, they even put usb sticks into vaults across different banks. To act as LN node they (and everybody else) would have to move those private keys online on server to be available 24/7 for LN users. Even exchanges don't do that e.g. bitfinex has less then 1% in hot wallet in LN it's all hot wallet.
Now it should be clear to you that LN nodes will require fees from users to make up for the locked funds, risk of having private keys online and they need to physically secure server with armed guards etc... Those fees would be payed as interest on locked funds so the bigger amount user want to transfer over LN more fees he needs to pay.
With on-chain transactions fees are payed per transaction and it is not important what value is being transferred 0.01BTC or 1000BTC
With LN it's the opposite, it is not important if user made 0 or million transactions, important is value transferred. If user opens channel for amounts up to 1BTC he will pay 10x less fees then if he opened channel for 10BTC.
If interest per month is e.g. 1% and tx fee is 0.5$, if somebody opens channel for up to 10000$ he will pay in fees 100$ (1% fee) + 1$ (2 on-chain tx) = 101$. In this scenario if that user made more then 202 tx he would be better off with LN otherwise he would be better off with on-chain.
So it's all about what kind of fees we would see in LN vs on-chain. Obviously for large amounts it will be cheaper to stay on-chain but for micro transactions it could very well work. Another serious competitor to LN are centralized services like exchanges, already exchanges are settling balances offline when possible with time they can interconnect and user from bitfinex would be able to pay to user from kraken offline. Sure that would not be decentralized but for small amounts it wouldn't matter to most users.
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:28:27
That's what I said, you support "100+ engineers" not issues them self. And it's not really 100+ engineers as descending opinions will be blocked and kicked out as it is shown many times before, it's only top of hierarchy that you support blindly others have voice only if they agree...

Nothing wrong with second layer solutions if they work. Lighting is cool concept I was thrilled when first learned about it, but has some big drawbacks which everybody here ignore. When lighting support is finally included in bitcoin protocol everybody will be surprised why nobody is using it...
RemindMe! One Year
I have no magic ideas unfortunately. That's why only viable solution for time being is increase block size and add support for lighting (that would be small change) just in case it does work for at least some users...

@_date: 2017-05-23 20:35:00
I think BU has "xthin blocks" and core has "compact blocks" as equivalent according to nullc 
I'll explain in short how I see this with most primitive technique...
1. each mining pool has it's own mempool of unconfirmed transactions.
2. mining pools and nodes share 95% of unconfirmed transactions
3. when miner solves block, instead of sending transactions (average 500B per tx) lets say he sends just transaction hash (32B)
4. miner receiving block already has in his mempool 95% and he just needs to download remaining 5% instead of full block
I suppose core and bu just went further with this and made it much more efficient.

@_date: 2017-05-06 22:31:26
I am not saying segwit has hidden bugs or that it would not work. I just think it would undermine bitcoin's future and that bitcoin would do much better without implementing segwit and it's drawbacks (and benefits).
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:26:40


Are you thick in the head?
@_date: 2017-05-06 23:59:54
Well you sound reasonable in your arguments...
Issues that I have with segwit I don't want to repeat I enumerated most important points here 
Yea block increase to 8MB or more will not completely solve scaling but will push the can down the road for some time (~2 years?) and will enable a lot more adoption. Later we would face scaling issue again.
I wouldn't mind adding LN support with block increase since that would be small change (you don't need whole segwit to support LN). I know exactly how LN works and I believe it will not help much with scaling. Drawbacks (costs) of LN I tried to explain here
 
So bottom line most important thing is to increase 1MB block size any way possible (even with segwit + block increase) everything else like LN, transaction malleability etc is less important.

Bitcoin is taking over gold use cases because gold is not useful for daily transactions that is my entire point! Bitcoin must be useful for daily transactions, at least for next ~10 more years


Lightning Network cant help with scaling even core devs will not say that publicly... Most they could say about LN is "could" "maybe" etc... truth is LN can't help with scaling, it will not be used on litecoin or anywhere else because it is economically flawed model... Show me one implementation how I can use LN to send litecoins to any exchange or merchant?
I explained many times to segwit parrots issues regarding LN but not everyone can understand that. Here are my main issues with LN 
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:36:42


Sorry but you are wrong e.g. 16MB would scale bitcoin x16...


Validating blocks is not the issue we should worry about over number of users network can support.
@_date: 2017-05-14 16:28:23


It's nowhere near being usable and never will be... Show me single LN implementation and how to use it to send litecoins to any exchange or merchant?
This concept is known for long time and is fairly simple to implement (LN is not technically complex at all), many devs have played with this for quite some time. You'll see that problem is not code is missing, problem is that LN has flawed economic model and no "code" can fix that...
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:17:28


I think in future initial blockchain download will not be needed. Users can start blockchain download from "new genesis block" like some snapshot starting from e.g. block 1000000.
Of course there would always be archive nodes that are storing whole blockchain but not every full node needs it.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:21:54


This is the only urgent thing that bitcoin needs to solve!
Malleability, quadratic hashing and other stuff are completely opposite, we can fix that but we don't have to at the moment as it would not affect users anyway...
Why is urgent?
Because it is slowing down adoption trough out the world and setting us back for years, this artificial block limit is more damaging for bitcoin then any central bank regulation.

Miners are irrelevant, if coin raise in price so will miners reward and miners would jump on that coin.

When do you expect first users to jump on board? I read some comments saying soon as segwit is activated we would have LN.
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:41:56
It depends for who.
People not invested in bitcoin shouldn't be bothered they can relax and watch, but for me that would be literally the worst possible thing that could happen.

You don't need proof their actions speak louder then words. And their actions are:
- Avoid increasing block size at any cost even driving large part of community and miners turn against them because of that 1 reason.
- They pretend they are doing something for bitcoin by solving some completely non important non urgent issues like malleability and are presenting that as something important just to distract community from real problems.
- They are perversely changing bitcoin protocol, expanding block header into coinbase transaction trough hack, splitting block into 2 types of blocks without any good reason. Creating new address format just so all wallets would become unusable and would have to be re-implemented, so that users would have to bother to learn "new" bitcoin, making many tutorials on bitcoin obsolete, making it more difficult to new devs to understand bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:30:36
Hm I don't have answer to this, I can only guess.
I see that one block is "Mined by AntPool usa3"
and the other one "Mined by AntPool usa4"
so maybe they are behaving as different pools.


Blockchain.info saw it in 22 seconds apart, still 22 seconds seems like to much maybe some glitch or some miner didn't receive update from pool and continued mining with old hash, I really can't tell what could be the reason, good catch.
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:25:06
Any PoW system would have such incentives set that in the end there would be only one mining pool no matter how big block is.
But if we don't increase block size soon we wont have to worry about solving that problem in future... Reducing block size right now would hurt bitcoin adoption a lot IMO.
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:31:16


Nope I have almost 10 years exp in c++ (didn't use Go) and I understand LN down to raw bytes.
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:29:26
I have to disappoint you, I would like UASF also but even if majority of core supporters are for it core devs will not allow it.
Their mission is to stall bitcoin as much as possible especially scaling part. That's why they set 95% threshold in first place so it would delay indefinitely.
@_date: 2017-05-14 15:09:27
No it's not going to work like that LN wont get user adoption you'll see. I must be very smart to see that in advance or you are all thick in the head.

We don't really need this improvement it is not important, block size is.

If LN is basically free and instant why not use it anyway?
You have valid point it's not the same, I guess we will have to wait for bitcoin to activate segwit (or die in the process) so that people like you can see it.

If bitcoin fails it will take down all alts with it. It would set back crypto currencies for at least 5+ years, that's how much time people would need to regain trust into crypto currencies and to start investing heavily as they are doing right now. It looks to me that people on both sides devs and miners want exactly that, at least that's what their actions are saying.
There is no value in me trying to creating some shiny new coin, all I want to happen is that bitcoin change this single variable and I would relax and wouldn't ask for anything else.
All devs on altcoins (litecoin, dash, eth...) said that of course they will raise block size in future when needed, I still don't understand core devs excuse. I am appalled how much damage this non-issue and some propaganda managed to do to bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-05-14 15:49:40


When would that happen in your opinion? In 1 year 2 years? I think never... Segwit wont allow more users to use blockchain especially not instantly and if it gets adopted by users it would be very modest throughput increase. Bigger blocks would be instant huge throughput increase we desperately need.
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:58:24
No, he is doing great service to bitcoin trying to enlighten as much of you "core devs knows the best" as one possibly can.
LN is not the answer to scaling bitcoin, I (c++ system dev with almost 10 years exp) also knew that from start.
LN is very simple concept technically, missing code is not the problem... Problem is underlying economic incentives and no amount of "code" can fix that.
Here are my main issues with LN in this comment 
@_date: 2017-05-07 14:41:01
Bitcoin is not democracy and that is a good thing.
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:27:51
It is inefficient increase as full block (block + witness data) wont hold as many transactions as normal simple block of that size would.
Witness data is mandatory part of blockchain as full nodes cant verify any segwit transaciton without it. Only difference is that witness block can be received after "main block" but that is ridiculous way to speed up block propagation.
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:06:53
Nothing wrong with that, if bitcoin can't support visa volumes then it cant and not eerybody can use it.
Problem is that bitcoin at least can support a whole lot more then 1MB per block...
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:59:25
First show me how to use LN effectively, or at least one real benefit of segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-14 15:19:29


I also don't use bitcoin at all except as store of value, but unlike these brain-dead segwit parrots I understand if bitcoin can't be used by "real" users for their real daily needs I won't be able to use it as store of value as well, because bitcoin would not be valuable any more...
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:38:20
I didn't dig deep into this issue like some other people like Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn but I believe propagation of 16MB would work right now.
Also propagation block between miners should evolve with time.
Miners already share most of unconfirmed transactions so in future miners would send/receive just header and simple hash and they will be able to recreate whole block from that so it wont matter that much if block is 1MB or 200MB.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:40:36
Antpool basically "trust" other nodes that block is valid (first few seconds). If other nodes would send "fake" block to antpool then antpool would waste mining power...
Maybe other pools don't start mining on top of the block until they have validated it?
EDIT: I see this as tweak/trick to somewhat increase profit margin.
@_date: 2017-05-13 05:45:02
My most preferred choice would be simple block size increase without adding any new complexity EC or any other.
- EC is adding much less complexity then segwit,
- EC can be dismissed later and changed with something else segwit cant
- I would support segwit (with all it's complexity and drawbacks) if it offered real block size increase, not increase soon as LN is widely used or soon as most users make switch to "new" bitcoin (new addresses).
@_date: 2017-05-08 02:17:07
I feel like I'm developing paranoia. Everything starts to look like delay tactics, like everyone is trying their best (both camps and miners) not to fork bitcoin as long as possible.
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:52:37
segwit is just delay tactic to stall bitcoin adoption as much as possible
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:55:18


That variety of "features" is not important as it doesn't fix one crucial problem users complain about, block size is big problem which all users are affected.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:31:54
Eventually quadratic block hashing will have to be solved but not any time soon. You don't have to solve that problem (or any other problem) in order to increase block size to 16MB.
Segwit doesn't offer anything of real value for real users.
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:50:14

@_date: 2017-05-13 05:11:00
Nope I don't mind LN or people trying to implement LN or whatever they think is worth their time I wish them best.
But I don't want LN to be used as excuse to not raise block limit.
@_date: 2017-05-14 04:23:15


You may not call it split but in essence it is. To verify segwit transactions full nodes must keep all blocks and all witness data. If block is incomplete without witness data, I call witness data mandatory part of blockchain, the second block type. So full block is block + witness data, please correct me if I said anything wrong...
EDIT: full nodes can ofc prune blocks and witness data they don't have to keep them forever but must verify them once...
@_date: 2017-05-14 04:08:19
Yes and why nobody is (and will not) use it on litecoin? If it is really free (cheap) and instant?
They say code is not written yet, I say that's just excuse. I know how LN works and it's not very complex solution at all. Technically LN could work, problem is with underlying economic incentives which are not met and no amount of "code" can fix that.
I stated my main issues with LN in this comment: 
@_date: 2017-05-13 05:00:49

I disagree, we should stick with current address format as long as possible even if bech32 is "better". Just like we stick to IPV4 instead of moving to IPV6. Only when there is real need e.g. ECDSA is broken or something like that we should change address format, but not change it every time there is new shiny thing slightly better. We must hold back not-so-important changes that would affect all users, wallets, software...

You cant predict how LN will play out by running any type simulation it must be real money. We can just guess how users would behave and my guess is that LN would not take off and fix scalability for multiple reasons.

@_date: 2017-05-06 23:03:34
Technically it works, but in practice would be way to expensive for handling big amounts. For small amounts it could make sense but people would rather use centralized services for that use case.
So LN eventually one day could work for some niche, but LN definitely  would not solve scaling issues today if implemented, not even close.
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:42:46
Very reasonable comment that I didn't saw in a while, and all negative comments. Shows how much people already have chosen sides and turned their brains off...
@_date: 2017-05-14 08:12:36
Then blocks in segwit are not 1MB as they are now but would be up to 4MB (I knew that all along), and that is equivalent to 2.2MB traditional "simple" block (in best case).
Why not just increase block size to 2.2MB and avoid complicating bitcoin with bech32, separation of signatures and transactions and new transaction format?
There are lot better much more efficient ways to propagate blocks then segwit, so that argument would not be valid IMO. Also 2MB is not enough...
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:49:53
No it doesn't.
Sidenote: We cant never ever fully solve bitcoin malleability. Why? Because even implementation like segwit that fix this, they do it only for segwit transactions not for "normal" ones.
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:32:00
I don't expect, that's my entire point. If segwit gets activated on bitcoin it would not be instant throughput increase only after users switch and taht can take long time... Block increase would be instant scaling solution and much much bigger than segwit would deliver.
@_date: 2017-05-06 23:33:34
No I never said it doesn't work at all, especially not because technical reasons. It can't work (solve scaling) because it would be to expensive for big amounts and inconvenient for small amounts. For small amounts it could maybe make sense one day but users would probably rather use centralized services for that use case.
@_date: 2017-05-06 21:38:26
Once this user moves to "second best" coin he will never come back even if scaling is solved in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-07 16:16:16

@_date: 2017-05-14 19:39:19
I have no problem with blockstream devs trying to improve technology in any way they see possible, I have problem with them using excuses to stifle real scaling which is block increase.
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:54:25


Yes, I don't really know flex-trans but looks like they are also adding complexity and not solving one crucial issue so I'm against it.


xThin is not change to core protocol, it's just more efficient way of transferring (zipping) blocks, miners will solve that issue on their own as only they really needs it. That can be gradually applied between them and not whole community needs to adopt it.


I think community is so divided that we will have to have fork segwit vs big block implementation and market will decide winner, maybe we could avoid that only if segwit adds block size increase. I cheer for UASF or any fork, the longer this standstill lasts the worse it is for bitcoin brand and adoption.
EDIT: I can't support segwit because segwit in it's current form is not block size increase IMO.

Litecoin is a lot more complex now, has blockchain split in two. When segwit fails to activate on bitcoin it will be a lot more difficult to maintain that code as they wont be able to leverage bitcoin code any more. Also it will be impossible for them to reverse back to remove segwit...
@_date: 2017-05-14 16:08:09
Nope it would be minor throughput increase but only after it gets adopted by users which can take years. Block increase would be instant and huge, you should learn what segwit is if you are supporting it. Ah yes you don't have opinion of your own you just trust "core devs" blindly and whatever they think is best, without thinking it trough yourself.

It's very simple... BU or any other implementation that would raise block size from 1MB to e.g. 16MB would enable a whole lot more people to join and make transactions.
Transaction fees would probably be above 1$ again pretty quickly but a lot more people would be allowed to use bitcoin meaning a lot more global adoption which is the most important thing for bitcoin...

Segwit drawbacks overweight it's benefits but I would also agree just to get that x2 increase.
Later when people see that nobody is using LN and that it was just talking point for people who doesn't understand it, then it will be easier to raise limit further.
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:55:27
segwit would force users to learn "new" bitcoin, new address format. Only after users switch to segwit addresses and after bitcoins are moved from "normal" addresses we would see small improvement x1.7 in best case, but most people would just stick with what they already know... Also segwit brings some big drawbacks without much benefit, most important I explained in this comment: 
Segwit is just delay tactic it is not answer to scaling problem by long shot.

1. new block is mined
2. before miners receive whole block they receive just block header first.
3. Now they can start mining new block on top right away because they don't need whole block just hash.
4. BUT they don't know which transactions are in the block and if they include in their block the same transaction as previous miner then their whole block is invalid.
5. so first couple of seconds they are mining empty blocks then when they receive and validate all transactions they can safely include new transactions....

To compare bitcoin with traditional corporation it would look like this:
bitcoin - decentralized corporation
miners - employees (protecting network for paycheck)
hodlers - stakeholders
users - customers
So I agree that users are very important if not essential for bitcoin to prosper but they should not make decisions on how bitcoin will develop.
Hodlers should make decisions and they will consider everyone's needs (customers and employees etc) to make bitcoin more successful.

@_date: 2017-05-06 18:22:33
It looks like there is strong political will on both sides to keep status quo.
As soon as segwit picks up some steam new miners starts signaling BU, then when BU is on the run F2Pool which everybody (both camps) thought would signal BU starts signaling segwit and we are again at the beginning.
I'm against segwit and for any implementation that would increase block size without changing protocol to much. But even I would like to see segwit activated at this point! Then at least people would see that LN didn't solve anything and then big blocks would have much more chances / better arguments.
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:49:16
