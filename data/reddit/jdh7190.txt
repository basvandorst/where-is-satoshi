Doesn't matter if you do not have hashing power (mining). Totally pointless. This was peddled as justification for not raising the block size.
Only a few use cases make sense - if you are coding your own integration against the blockchain or as a merchant to ensure transactions are legit.

Disagree. Debt is slavery, coercing people to go into debt for shit they don't need.
Inflation is the hidden tax, happening every day due to the fractional reserve banking system, this is how we are robbed of purchasing power.
Best use is to invest those dollars into something you truly own like real estate, metals and crypto.
 Dollars are units of debt owed back to the Fed with interest. Dollars are backed by nothing, created out of nothing.

Futures, derivatives, even most stock investments (ones where you have no stake in the company and don't pay dividends) are all forms of legalized gambling. 
The bitcoin futures are cash settled meaning no real bitcoin is being traded. They are just speculating (gambling) on the price moving.

I don't understand how a regime can be totalitarian (dictatorship) when he was voted for/elected by its people.
 
Also in the words of a former president, Venezuela has one of the best election processes:
 
People really need to do their own research before repeating stuff they heard on the television.

We did not have slow, steady inflation. I do agree that inflation is not necessarily bad for an economy.
The problem is that via fractional reserve banking, the money supply increases everytime a loan is taken out. One thing for sure that caused the housing bubble is that banks were handing out subprime mortgages to anyone and everyone - this inflated the housing prices. Taking this into consideration along with the casino games (derivatives, futures) Wall Street was playing an economic crash occurs.
Now this time is much worse because interest rates were around 5% in 2007. Now we have had 0% up until a couple of years ago. 
0% interest rates mean that everyone can borrow money cheaply which increases the money supply and so on. This upcoming crash will be worse than 2008.
Prices in my area in Atlanta were 50% higher in 2007 than in 2013 when I purchased a home. In that same area homes are selling higher than what they were in 2007.
Also let's remember that audit of the Fed showed they printed 16 trillion to bail out the banks. That is inflation, and no way is only 2% like the Fed has been claiming.

Yes. Fees are anywhere between 1-3% per transaction and contrary to popular belief, much slower. 
A merchant doesn't actually get paid until days after you swipe the card.

Holy shit I cannot believe the top comment on this thread is so ignorant, and that you are getting downvoted.
OP is correct, we have been brainwashed into thinking the dollar losing 97% of its purchasing power is fine. Tell that shit to people who lost half their retirement savings in 2008. 
A decade of 0% interest rates and a rising ponzi stock market has made us Americans blind to the fact that our economy is in deep shit. 
Never forget Bitcoin was created to oppose the insolvent banks and corrupt Federal Reserve System.

Under our constitution Congress/the treasury should only be able to print money. If done properly they would only print under certain economic conditions.
People wouldn't need loans if their currency had not been devalued by over 90% since 1913. 
People wouldn't need loans if we didn't have the bullshit income tax since 1913.
People wouldn't need loans if our dollar was not a debt issued note, instead of one backed by gold or the U.S. Treasury.

Yes this is possible. I would not personally participate in this type of activity, I'd be 100% against some exchange like coinbase even allowing this.
The allowance of fractional reserve banking will always be abused because humans are greedy - it's their nature. 
For our sake, it should be barred from crypto otherwise we will fall into the same trap as with fiat 
I'd argue that everyone should store their own bitcoin/crypto. 
As someone else points out loans via smart contract implementation could work but that should come as a mutual agreement between two people.

My mind is blown every time someone posts the truth about the Federal Reserve system that the comments attack and call bullshit.
Is it because they are paid shills? Bots? Or uneducated?
If they are uneducated this is understandable because our school system does not teach is this ON PURPOSE.
Economics is not that hard to understand but is made nedlessly complicated in school by design.
I would advise anyone invested in cryptocurrency to please understand how this system completely fucks over the American people.
Everytime a loan is issued in dollars - because of fractional reserve banking, the currency is inflated. The money is created out of nothing. Banks can loan much more than what they actually have.
If we did not have fractional reserve banking, this would not be possible as banks could only lend out what they have on deposit. 
This is why crypto is such an interesting counter - no authority can arbitrarily increase the money supply, at least without strong inclination from the people.

As some people state natural inflation is OK in the economy but having a private central bank being able to arbitrarily inflate the currency by essentially having the treasury print it is a problem. (see 16 trillion dollar bank bailouts from housing crisis)
The difference with bitcoin is that yes it's fixed but is divisible which means the people have the power to inflate by the way they transact.
Some central authority cannot inflate the currency just because they want to.
