Hashnest is legitimate. They charge $.19/Th  per day. But you can sell your hash on their exchange. So you can recover your principle.

He's not saying 21 million people will have one. He's saying that large of a demand will drive the price up.

Good, thanks for the psa!

You cant for genesis. I said hash nest is legitimate. They're owned by bit main, the mining hardware company in china, and the antpool owners.   
Unfortunately you're screwed.

Being high is a problem if the price of bitcoin goes below a certain threshold. Mining is less profitable now by a striking amount vs. 2 months ago.
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:40:11
The same hash power now is generating less bitcoin by a marked difference vs two months ago. That also means less fiat is generated. Mining is extremely power intensive. So it means it's less profitable no matter how you slice it.

I know, I feel for you. I'm sorry.

If you're holding bitcoin for a while I suggest using hashnest and buy cloud mining. Its an effortless way to turn bitcoin into more bitcoin. I average about .4% return per day. They have a hash market so I can sell my hash for bitcoin or buy more hash. Their maintenance ce fee averages to about 28%. Without rebuying hash its around 150% APR, if you rebuy hash daily its more lime 400 to 500% APR. Its really a no brainer. So no matter what bitcoin dooez, to an extent, I can make a profit.

They've been around for years. They manufacture the ant miners. I personally have had no issues withdrawing bitcoin. If you have evidence they are a ponzi scheme I encourage you to share it.

That website tracks transactions and reports ratings for the individual much like ebay. There was no one near me  so I didn't bother, I just used coinbase.  The ATMs are useless as they overcharge by about 10% or more.  Libertyx may work but looks like a pain.

Do a wire transfer if you can do them for no fee with your bank. I wired money to Gemini and it was available in 12 minutes.

You pretend to know a lot without being able to offer anything tangible.

use bank wires. They deposit with in the hour for me. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:13:12
Why not just cloud hash, it's basically a free .5% of principal btc per day you can either wallet or rebuy hash with. Just use hashnest or anyone who has a market so that you can recover your principal.   
On 47 btc and this price I'm walleting .22 btc per day

The payoff for mining with antS9 is very high right now. Reinvesting that payoff daily is the same as compounding interest at a daily rate. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:22:45
I like Gemini, a wire from my bank took 12 minutes to reach my Gemini account. Zero wire fees as well. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:58:23
It's worth looking into. I only use hashnest, the maintenance fee on the antS9 is about 28%, varies depending on how many blocks are found.  More blocks lower fee.  I think the S9 has plenty of time to remain profitable, the S7 is still running strong. The only downside is the hash market volume is only about 300 TH/s per 24hours. Which is about 40 to 50 BTC. So moving a lot of hash would be hard.

Contempt prior to investigation is sure to leave a man forever in ignorance.

Use wire transfers there are no fees on incoming wires. My bank has no fees on outgoing. The only fee is for purchasing from the exchange. Plus, the wire hits within the hour on business days.

Which claims did you find extraordinary during your investigation?

I have a checking account with three banks where I have "investment products". BOA, chase and Merrill lynch. They're all the same thing.

I put in 10btc on December 30th w
2016. It pays out in btc every block found and I rebuy hash. My 10btc is now worth 16.2 btc on the hash market.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:43:33
Yeah, I'm hoping it crashes back to nothing so I feel better.

I've got about 5 million Doge in a wallet from the old gpu mining days. No idea what the passphrase is. My wife is convinced it's "hairy balls" but that didn't work. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:26:14
I use hashnest t mine because I don't want to own hardware. Hashnest is owned by bitmain who produce mining hardware. I buy hash on their website from other users on a hash market which is an exchange. Mining has roughly a 30% maintenance fee. Any hash you buy can be resold. This is the key, you can liquidate your position at anytime.

Great question! Thanks for posting.
