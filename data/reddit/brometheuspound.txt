I'm hodling, but I'd be lying if I said this stuff with BCH doesn't have me nervous as hell. Here's to hoping in 5 years we still have a great asset!

Great way to end up in prison my friend.

That's a completely incorrect way of calculating net worth with assets. Your worth is based on what the assets are valued at in that moment.
It's okay to be worried about losing 15% of your portfolio in 3 days, even if you're confident it will rebound.

It's tough to predict, because BTC could become like Yahoo but it also benefits greatly of being the first. Normies flock to name brands, so I have a hard time seeing anything overtaking Bitcoin in the next 10 years at least.
On a related tangent, my crackpot theory is that ETH will never challenge Bitcoin as the de facto currency because of the name. I can't picture myself having a serious discussion with my mom about Ethereum, which sounds like a precious metal from a fantasy novel. Bitcoin is simple and professional, something the general public can get used to.

This is just Coinbase's home page, but there are many other websites that chart prices as well. My favorite is CoinMarketCap.
