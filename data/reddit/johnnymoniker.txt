I can't think of a way to safely do this without giving you an easy way to locate the original posting.
I don't feel comfortable exposing the guys information more than it already has been.
A reporter basically just told the world that a man from suburban LA possibly has half a billion dollars buried in his backyard.  
He's got 99 problems and privacy aint one

The topics he touches on look about right, but how are you making this connection otherwise.....? Hopefully not the  anagramical similarities in names.

Your first link was to the second link I posted. my takeaway from that was that the newsweek reporter observed that he switches between American English and British English spelling conventions, presumed to be a side effect of many of the hobbyist trains he imported from England from his childhood had manuals written using  British english.
his usage of 'tyre' in that post is not necessarily a misspelling, as that's how a brit would spell it.
re: the phone posting
excellent point, and he uses text notation in two reviews:
'rust u don't c.'
'if u bump the mirror'
those bothered me mainly because they seemed so out of character even from the posts we can attribute to "dorian" (not satoshi).  but posting from a mobile device may in part explain that

Proves nothing, but the man that wrote the one in 2004 is able to express his thoughts clearly and in a precise manner.
Seems like a pretty logical dude, and had you only read the crazy rant about LA transit and the amazon articles, you would not get that simpression.
Hardly conclusive, but lets get some more facts so the analysis isn't biased by making ridiculous comparisons

I've found much more posted by dorian under various psuedonyms, but it's more or less consistent with those writing styles.  Much of it contains contact information (phone-email) so I won't include them here.

I know what you mean, about the British spelling conventions, I do it myself from time to time, but though it's not exceedingly rare to see an American author do it, it's uncommon enough to use as a tool of analysis.
Also, according to the article, and some googling I've been doing..
Dorian lived in New Jersey post 9/11, the range of dates he lived there is unclear, it may have been during the time that Satoshi was active on the boards. Or perhaps he's a night owl

They should have dug around a bit more, there are better and more lucid examples of his writing, the man's passionate about model trains, start there:
(search for 'dorian' and it'll take you straight to his comments)
this one in particular is interesting, notice that he adopts the british spelling of 'tyre'
and this one from 2004 where he appears particularly sharp:
