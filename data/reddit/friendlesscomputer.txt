Except crashes are frequent and there's no denying Bitcoin is in a massive bubble right now, quite possibly one even bigger than the dot-com bubble. Sure it's easy to store physically, but as an actual unit to store value as of right now it's awful. 


And we've already seen the ill effects of trustless and regulationless systems. Dare I mention Mt. Gox? Despite not being a central bank it was for a time the only big-name one around and the community really adopted it as a single entity for storing and transferring BTC. I'm not too familiar with the Bitcoin scene as I left shortly after that fiasco and it seems like there's competition now but that's still a pretty glaring problem.
And what about the frequent "xyz pool is too close to 51%!!! abort abort switch now!" posts you constantly see? You're putting a lot of trust into an easily gamable system filled with profiteering miners. 


Most of your points are either wrong (the federal government can indeed seize Bitcoin... see also: SilkRoad), and the other points are either already crimes (lying to Border Patrol) or the regulations simply haven't caught up to new tech yet.

Sooner or later that's going to run out. I can't see how anyone justifies a $180 billion market cap for a crypto whose only real use is to buy drugs on the Internet and coffee at a few random Seattle hipster coffee shops. And all this talk about price and not about the practicalities of Bitcoin really shows where the majority's midnset is

If you can't answer "why is it soaring in price right now" it probably is.

Ever hear of the FDIC?

The fact that we're still talking about prices and "getting burned" by investing into a heavily manipulated market speaks volumes about where Bitcoin will end up long term.

Wait, LN *still* isn't a thing? Two years ago at the height of the bubble when fees were so high you'd have to pay $5 in fees to buy a $1 coffee, everyone was saying LN adoption was "right around the corner."
