lol do you really think the new investors who heard about btc over thanksgiving and just got in, and don't even know what a futures exchange is, are going to hold the first time this dips? they're going to run for the hills and never come back. all this new money is uninformed "hey i heard this thing makes you rich" money. that money runs in fear the second they realize they can lose.

it is so amazing to me how many people that have no financial investment experience or knowledge are willingly investing in crypto...

why are you assuming that they had a balance at the time of the b cash fork?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:14:27
so you made $11 off a 1200 rise, but somehow would have made $19 more from an additional 800 rise? 
do you know how numbers work?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:05:42
i guarantee that 99% of the first time buyers over the past month have no concept of the utility btc provides (or lacks), have no interest besides seeing if they can make potential profit, and have their coins sitting on an exchange, completely counter-intuitive to the idea of bitcoin. not sure how you can logically consider that mass adoption.

i'm not saying that i personally feel this way, you clown. if you honestly think that there aren't massive amounts of people that do feel that way, then i'm sorry to say, but you are the joke.
also, you ignored my question. explain how this is more likely to interfere with the price discovery process as opposed to aid it, I'm anxious to  hear your enlightened opinion.

no i've never heard of shorting before. you got me again with your in depth finance knowledge!
i'm not arguing whether or not these futures contracts will prove overall beneficial or not for bitcoin as a whole. I'm simply trying to explain to you who "needs" the futures, or who the main people that will be interested in them are.
it's never been traded on the futures market because the big players in the futures exchange markets hadn't taken the steps to offer futures contracts on bitcoin, therefore the majority of traditional investors didn't feel comfortable allocating money into crypto. Now one (CME) has decided to offer it due to recent demand, therefore you're going to see things like bitcoin traded on the futures market, bro
Older traditional investors with big pockets want in on the action and this is the only way the bulk of them would ever take the leap. i don't understand why you're having such a hard time grasping this obvious fact. it's a step towards legitimacy in the eyes of many.

you are an absolute clown.

there ya go. knew you could do it.
@_date: 2019-12-30 14:13:21
sold to or bought out by... go ahead, you got this...
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:09:03
if you think it's going to keep dropping, why are you suggesting that people even buy back in at 3800, where did you even pull the 3800 figure from? 
your reason for why it's going to drop was "because it hasn't done anything but drop since December". Do you realize how vague and useless that "analysis" is?
Do you honestly think you have even the faintest clue what is going on to be posting anything close to buy/sell tips on the internet? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:05:35
the general idea you just proposed is fine, and obviously true... the point is that you didn't describe anything remotely close to that idea in your previous messages. you literally said "cash out now" while also providing an arbitrary target price to buy back in implying that btc price will be down in the 3800 range in ~2 months time... a figure that you later acknowledge "was just a number you threw out there". 
if u regularly communicate your "general ideas" this poorly *you* have *absolutely* no business posting.

am i mistaken that the current bitcoin network isn't suited to handle the high trading volumes that would likely come along with major institutional futures/arbitrage trading?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:32:27
based on what
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:28:31
can wall street whales naked short hundreds of millions of any cash settled contracts with zero risk in the underlying? aren't there margin requirements in place for players that large?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:22:59
you think major institutions are going to trade BTC futures without hedging with actual BTC? And do you think the inevitable price variances between the futures prices and the spot BTC price won't cause people to buy BTC for arbitrage purposes?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:38:41
are you asking if anyone here know what a future is? yes. yes, many people here know precisely what a future is. 
who needs futures? are you questioning the volume (i.e. "need") of the futures market in general?
 
how about people who want to get in on bitcoin but don't understand the tech side or don't trust themselves to buy/secure it correctly, therefore they feel more comfortable using a reputable institution?
finally, why would this interfere with price discovery as opposed to aiding it?
