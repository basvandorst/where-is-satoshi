Backstory: I found a Reddit post a while back with a painting I really liked named "Bitcoin is the future" or something, I tracked down the artist and bought the print with permission to create a t-shirt. I'm not a graphic artist, though, and could use some feedback. 
**Dope or nah?**
Should it use two different font styles(perhaps an 80s style script font on the bottom)?
This shirt type is just normal printing and thus the print area shown here is basically as large as it can be, however, I do have an alternative option of "allover printing" which might be cool, but I can't think of a patttern/background that would fit?

I haven't yet but it's a good idea! I am an expat however and I dont speak the language at a high enough level yet - but I'll consider it ��
@_date: 2018-08-16 06:57:25
Interesting, it's a painting so I can't modify much. Might be able to change the hair color though, cheers

Yeah I think you're right; when I generated some mockups it was too high up, will definitely tweak it

Phew, I gotta learn that shit myself. Try posting your designs sporadically on Reddit and try to find a niche subreddit to post it on? Reddit ads?
@_date: 2018-08-16 06:56:23
It's a print of a painting. I can't change much.
@_date: 2018-11-01 18:02:01
The image came from a painting by the lovely and talented "barsa_artist" on Instagram. Yes, I had permission. ��

You right you right.

Weird that the crypto market still tanked, eh?
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:13:40
Exciting. At the same time, annoying to read this and have to then wait to actually get it. No email list to subscribe to for the launch, either? I don't wanna follow a million folks on Twitter.

This is the scariest part for me:

I'm more concerned about the second part of my sentence, sorry if unclear.


Buying a service with Bitcoin and using said service cannot be money laundering. Buying something with Bitcoin and converting it to something else, maybe. Even so, how can you know the Bitcoin was procured from illegal activity? The point here is that this is a dangerous idea for our justice system to be considering and can be used to harass normal users of Bitcoin in the future.

So I was thinking about that use case exactly. Let's say you come back from Las Vegas with over $10k cash. You could buy enough BTC through the ATM to get under the $10k reporting threshold.
Or just a convenient way to get rid of your leftover foreign currency after traveling.

I'll take it.
