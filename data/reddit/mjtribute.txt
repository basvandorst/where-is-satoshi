Great idea, great execution. Thanks for the continuous improvements.

How is this different from testnet?

Somebody tip this man! (I would if I had any BTC currently)

Let's not forget that, even with its minimal compliment of vendors, bitcoin holds far more flexibility than gold as a medium of exchange.

This article is a mischaracterization of the state of the problem which it attempts to describe. 
The article fails to mention that the "dust" limit for payments is derived is from a miner-defined setting. Assuming that miners disagreed with the default setting, or if the value of bitcoin increased sharply in a short amount of time, *the minimum payment amount can be tweaked accordingly*.
This renders the change made by Gavin to be downright uncontroversial, and a non-issue. Lets not make a mountain out of a molehill, as this article does.

I really do appreciate your sentiment here, but try to understand the situation perspective of the developers of bitcoin.
This is an engineering problem.
Many people assume that the entire blockchain is required to verify a block. It is not. All that is needed is something called the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Outputs) which is a data structure which enumerates all spendable coins across the entire bitcoin network.
The blockchain is roughly 7.8GB in size. The UTXO is only 300mb in size. While the blockchain is generally archived to disk, the UTXO is kept in memory at all times by miners.
Why do I mention all this? Because sufficiently small transactions are allocated in the UTXO *permanently* as a matter of practice. Why do I say as a matter of practice? Because one day those transactions may become more valuable, and fees may be reduced at that time to make such payments possible.
Until then, from an engineering standpoint this is a denial of service vulnerability. If a determined party wants to render bitcoin unusable, they can cheaply create enough garbage transactions to force every single miner on the network to consume a significant amount of memory to verify EVERY transaction. This is not a theoretical problem, it is real and may as well be the exhaust port in the Death Star.
The default implemented by Gavin is therefore very reasonable by today's standards and can easily be modified in the future if and when it becomes necessary to change it for economic reasons.

Liking what I'm seeing so far. Here's a suggestion, which may prevent some unintended purchases:
I noticed that after I 'purchased' some testnet bitcoin, I was redirected to  If I refresh the page, my browser gives me the option to submit the form again, even though I'm on a new page. By doing so, it inadvertently creates a second purchase. I would expect it only to refresh the status of whether the first trade had gone through, and definitely not create another bitcoin purchase without clearly indicating it.
I'll keep poking around to see if I can find anything else.

It is important to remain skeptical of bitcoin's long term adoption in the face of graphs like this one. 
Until bitcoin existed, the mere idea of cryptocurrencies was a pie-in-the-sky. Now that has been demonstrated that such a model can serve as an effective medium of exchange, the possibility exists that other improved implementations will surface.
The usefulness of bitcoin will in the long term be determined by whether the types of transactions enabled by bitcoin are desirable. The network effects of bitcoin suggest that any competing currency will have to swim against the current of inertia already in place, but it is not impossible for a competing currency to one day be conceived and widely adopted.
All I'm saying is not to get too stoked by the dollar signs in your eyes. Diversify your investments, and don't risk any more than you can afford to lose.

As a programmer and bitcoin enthusiast, I think your explanation is on point and concise. Thank you.

Mulpacha, in fact, this patch allows exactly that to happen.
That is, if a miner wants to, they can set a previously hardcoded fee higher. Miners can collectively vote for higher transaction fees should the need arise.
