It's not fake, it just doesn't work.

Who is this "they?"
@_date: 2019-11-28 01:11:47
Well, that might be the idea. But it doesn't work out that way for basically anyone. Making consistent money doing technical analysis is a myth, a fantasy. The vast majority of people trading lose money. That is fact.
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:16:14
Yes I guess not. Me and most other people. So that's fine.

Well if he pays his taxes like he should then he shouldn't have anything to worry about.
@_date: 2019-11-09 12:40:31
I doubt anyone is going to go to such great lengths tracking this guy down to rob him of his $900. The only people that would even know his exact location and name are very specific people at his ISP.
@_date: 2019-11-09 12:48:06
I'm pretty sure that in ten years this post isn't going to be remembered by anyone. And if it is, for all they know he could have sold.
@_date: 2019-11-02 16:59:44
That's why you split it across more than one. Probably should also check in from time to time.
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:49:31
Maybe if the FBI got involved.
@_date: 2019-11-27 23:15:21
weather forecasts work quite well and are generally correct

Then he might have a problem if Coinbase is forced to hand over his trading activity. But that won't be because the IRS was monitoring this reddit post.
@_date: 2019-11-28 01:17:43
If that's true then you would be in the something like the top 1% of traders ever. So I feel pretty safe saying that you're full of crap.

The max tax on long term capital gains in the US is around 20%. No where near 50%.

This person is probably a child that has never had a job.

Maybe this wife he claims to have in the house with zero knowledge on BTC found the seed phrase and used it to get back at him for hiding it from her.
@_date: 2019-10-05 17:08:38
I think the simple answer is the one he probably doesn't want to accept. He made a mistake somewhere that compromised his seed or his device. It's probably not something he even remembers doing and that would explain the confusion. Or he is lying and is very persistent. In a post in another thread he claims to live with a wife in the house that has no idea what BTC or crypto even is. From the sound of it he is someone that is very involved with crypto, talking about it openly on his twitter, owning hardware wallets and having a fairly large amount of BTC. So that's very suspicious and doesn't add up. Made a mistake or is lying.

I like the way you think
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:18:48
Getting a consistent 10% return yearly that's reliable enough to retire on is probably less likely than BTC reaching 500k
@_date: 2019-10-05 18:10:29
In all honesty I don't think the new fees are that much. Gemini has similar fees, Kraken and Polo trading fees are about  half of that but Kraken charges for USD deposits. Coinbase and Gemini seem like much more reliable services to me. Maybe it's reasonable to expect to pay a little more for the better service? And speaking from the point of view of a person in the US i'm not comfortable taking my business overseas.

Care to explain? That's a pretty odd opinion. I guess you can have a copy of the blockchain on hand without internet but how would you send or receive transactions? How would you stay up to date on the latest blocks? What use is it to just have it without the internet? It would just be an outdated archive....right?
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:32:55
I think you're too short sighted. The halvenings keep happening and the moon is a long way away.
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:04:09
That isn't really how it works. It would only work that way if you had zero other taxable income for that year. Capital gains that don't raise your total taxable income over 40k aren't taxed. If you make 45k a year at your job then make 25k in capital gains that same year it's all taxed. The only difference is that those capital gains are taxed at a special rate.
@_date: 2019-12-08 01:10:57
I'm going to guess that this is fake or a joke. Although if real I am impressed.

 "Coinbase Pro was an absolute breeze to set up for ACH transfers. This Kraken shit is ridiculous."
Kraken is known to be the cheaper service. Makes sense.

You get what you pay for?
@_date: 2019-12-08 01:22:03
Soooo.....buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-12-08 13:53:36
It doesn't take a hour to complete. I think you must be referring to a older standard that six confirmations was considered irreversible.
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:06:23
It's priced in already because it's a known event in the near future. People are already buying or selling based on that information and driving the price.
@_date: 2019-12-08 01:15:13
Well that's neat. I'm impressed. I like the concept that you can buy real estate with BTC directly. I think that if you try to buy real estate with fiat gains from crypto they won't allow it unless you've held the money for quite some time .
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:00:49
They will have less BTC to sell and need to sell it for more. The event is known and it's true that it's already priced in. It will probably crash right after the halvening. Less selling pressure in the long run is the real upside here.
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:25:44
You have to look at it two different ways. The long term effects will be the reduced selling pressure and that won't be seen until after the event occurs. However, for right now people are able to buy or sell based on the known information that the halvening is happening and that does drive the price right now.
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:42:25
I mean, isn't that the true spirit of this thing to begin with?
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:52:17
You know that isn't what I mean. But that's a funny comment, sure.
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:39:44
Except that Microsoft only stopped taking BTC for about a week or so. Likely for updates or something or other, I can't remember. You can currently spend BTC at their store.
@_date: 2019-12-15 01:31:02
Well the average person that doesn't know about bitcoin isn't going to be moving the price of bitcoin anyway. Halving or not. What's your point?
