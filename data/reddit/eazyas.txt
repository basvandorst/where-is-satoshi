I looked at bitcoin a year or so ago and wanted to buy a few but never got round to it and i forgot, now bitcoin once again caught my  attention and i dint want to let it slip this time. I live in the uk, its hard to sort out buying one online here, i was going to get a friend to use his i-phone to try and buy one for me, however, i found out that service with pingit  and blockchain went down 4 days ago. Im also a coin collector so i thought buying one of these was the way to go, shame about the premium , however, it was all that was available that i could find at the time. I dont think its gonna be a v1 coin or anything, ill let you guys know more when i recieve physiciall delivery :-)
