Well if I am reading it right its because they dont consider it a currency, but "property" thus would be taxable.  However at my tax bracket it appears to be 0% long term capital gains tax.  I wonder if that new law that people don't like here would turn it into a currency?

Is it?  I was debating this in my mind.  As I never bought BTC, I mined it back in 2011.  If I had 1 euro for 6 years and buy something with it, I don't have to be taxed buying something for that 1 euro right?  Either way it doesn't seem like much money, but it just seems to not make sense to buy something with foreign currency and have to pay some sort of income tax on it?  It's different than converting it from a foreign currency to USD and paying a windfall tax right?

I just found my old wallet address, from back in 2011.  After I get the blockchain reloaded, how do I go about moving these to be sold?

So do you need the money now?  For me it was worth getting a new computer than doubling my money or more.  Is 3.5k worth of weed better now or is 5k weed better later?  Even more so, is 20k of weed worth it to you later as well?  In another 5 years if bitcoin stays on its track it will probably be 100k, so it will be 20k.

What would you do with that extra 2k?

Is there anything you need that $2500 for?

Just want to say I found &gt;.25 BTC from an old wallet that had 1.5 days of mining back in 2011 (on a 6950).  I just cashed out getting myself a new computer Threadripper, 1080ti, H20 cooling, NVME etc.  Not sure what the best way to figure out what to mine (when I'm not gaming like sleeping/work) with the 1080ti or my current H20 cooled RX480, but any advice would be great ($.071kwh).  I tried to read lots of guides and ended up slightly confused compared to how I mined back in 2011.
Lastly, on cashing out now.  One, it was a wondrous surprise to find that old wallet.  Was going to get a new system when my tax return (plus end of year bonus) came in, but that extra cash will be good for putting into my house.  
I did the calculations based on different prices of BTC from 16k to 20k within the possibility of a year and it wasn't a huge difference.  I also then compared the possibility of it being 100k five years from now and if I can be ok with that ~15k difference.  After a 5 days of deliberations while my wallet updated, I ended up on settling on 17k cash out point.  It pays for my system (DDR4 prices killed me) and if I wish to I can mine zcash/eth/monero if I want some more BTC or alts to hold onto.
The last thing was a computer nerd thing where I had to figure out if I wanted to wait for Volta GPUs or Zen+(2) TR.  However looks like either of those may wait till next summer and even if BTC stays or ups a little bit, that wait isn't worth it.
Just wanted to share my .2btc.

It's because someone said that the name means roughly as wisdom/intelligence central. I thought I was reading it on btc.

Is 2k pot worth possibility of losing 3.5k?

Apparently I can use it on Newegg as well.

Which is why I think bitcoin fails as a "currency", but not necessarily as something of value.  Among various other things bitcoin (that I recall) really started getting real world investment when the financial situation in Europe started going bad (such as Greece).  When peoples faith in the banks fell below something few of them probably understood, crypto-currency.
Bitcoin has value because people put value on it and transferred from one form of value into another believing it to better hold the value it already had.
Bitcoin is much as useful as a currency as gold is, which is pretty impractical to use, however, gold can still be a good holder of value.  Which is where I think Bitcoin is and should go, rather than trying to have Bitcoin compete with the USD, it should be more anomalous with gold.
Other alt coins are better suited to constant transactions, but that doesn't mean they are as valuable as BTC, but they can be used as a transition between BTC and goods/services.  So BTC is to gold as  altcoins are to the USD.  The USD (or altcoins) are how we buy goods/services, but are backed by BTC.
At least that's how I see the future going.

What happens if you just buy some computer parts on Newegg (like a few thousand $ worth)?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:25:22
No, I am in the US, but that's what is basically going on.  I'm purchasing computer parts in a foreign currency (BTC) and not converting it to US dollars then purchasing it.  And I didn't "buy" it (so like foreign currency exchange rates where you would pay capital gains on the difference?).
Put another way, its like I found a gold nugget several years ago and now I'm trading that gold nugget for something.

Sorry I'm getting old and just woke up, it was 2010.

Sold my 0.2 btc I mined back in 2007 when it hit 17200.
