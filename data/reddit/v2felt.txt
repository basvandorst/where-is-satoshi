I thought this was old news?      
       
       
Note the date in the Bristol Post article.  I wouldn't necessarily believe this story until there's more evidence than some PR-like articles from shitty tabloids.       
MintPal/Moolah fell, and this guy made his exit, all under the cover of a monster dogecoin pump and a fishy "suicide" of the ball comic artist (also used press releases, turrrrrible proof). I wouldn't be terribly shocked if this was a cover for a Bitfinex exit (unlikely, but possible).      
      
EDIT - This type of maneuver was tried before back in early 2015:              
     
Whatever happened with that case?   :P

Has this loss been verified by an independent person?  Shouldn't there be a tracking number that shows the shipment as being lost - something customers can check against?

He called for the moratorium, which is interesting.       
     
     
Maybe this is all a big lesson soon to be revealed.

true as a cannon; helpful like a dentist.

Great post.  I posted this over at BCT and its somewhat related in the sense that proving identity relies on the continuity of certain variables between the past and present:    
    
How about Dr. Wright post some code he's written for another project so we can see how his coding style compares?         
     
I Wonder what Martti and Hearn think of all of this hoopla considering they had private correspondence with Satoshi way back when (in addition to collaborating on code)?        
     
I wonder who all got invited to opine on the veracity of Dr. Wright's claim? If Hearn and Martti were not asked to opine on the evidence, or even Theymos, why not?  I believe Grigg works at R3 - surely Hearn has some info here.  Perhaps Hearn is Satoshi - he did coin the phrase SPV IIRC (according to him).      
  
Back to the code comparison issue.  A code comparison is something I've been working on for a bit.  I'll share a little now.  If you look at the original bitcoin files, you will Satoshi liked to break up his code into chunks using both whitespace and comment blocks.  For many comment blocks, entire lines were filed w/ dashes to break up the code/to start and end a comment.  See here (just scroll through):      
      
       
I haven't seen any current developers break up their code blocks with this convention (and it is a convention, see  of first section here:  Indeed, many of the original comment blocks have been removed.  I have not reviewed every Satoshi-suspect's code for similar codeblock comment borders, but I have looked at a lot of them.  Only one person I've found so far utilizes comment block borders like Satoshi did:

Here's a side-by-side of the first pages of the Wright paper and the first page of the Bitcoin Whitepaper:

Correct. Hearn claimed, maybe too strongly, that he coined the term SPV.  There was a brouhaha over that claim a while back. I was referencing Hearn in my post to raise the issue of what his opinion on this craig-thing might be (since he probably has an interesting perspective on the matter) and to also be a little funny RE: the SPV "coining" brouhaha from a few months back.

Not sure we can draw that conclusion just yet.  His expertiese may be a complicated issue.  See my post here providing a juxtaposition of a Jan 2008 paper of Wright's w/ the Bitcoin White paper published later that year:

Montana is "wild." (you'll have to dig to understand the Montana reference).    
       
One big crypto biz claims to have been located - at least at one point - in Montana.  There might be a whale involved.
