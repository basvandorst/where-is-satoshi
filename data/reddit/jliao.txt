Not sure what your point is with that text dump. Let's be honest you're becoming delusional because you've likely suffered catostrophic losses and you're not willing to believe that someone could take your money and get away scot free. Unforunately that is not the reality of what is happening. Sorry.

Thats why Eddie Snowden went to Hong Kong after exposing the NSA right? The US was sure glad that the Chinese govn't cooperated with extraditing him quickly. 
Just want to add that perhaps that in the past the HK courts would have been impartial. Nowadays the court says whatever the Chinese government dictates. Period. If you don't believe look up historical cases in which China has folded to the extradition requests of the US. Almost never, and in the few cases which they do it's a man for man swap.

the US is not going to extradite any director from Hong Kong/Taiwan that would violate China's sovreignty and is 100% the reason why BFX decided to situate themselves in Asia. China doesn't give a flying fuck if a group of westerners scam a bunch of other westerners and hide out in China to spend their ill gotten gains. They would only intervene if Chinese nationals were fleeced but AFAIK China has their own platforms for margin trading.

said it before and i'll say it again, when MtGox happened the key players all got away scot-free leaving the plebs to pay reparations, same thing will happen here again. 1 year in jail is no big deal if you walk away with millions just remember that. i mean doctors spend 10 years in school just to earn 350k - 1 mil for the rest of their lives how much is a 70 mil jackpot worth in relation to the time you'll spend in prison? plus it's unlikely anyone will go to prison b/c this is asia we're talking about...

only parties with the money/lawyers/leverage to get an injuction would be whales, however this agreement was specifically negotiated with whales in mind. make no mistake if you were not invited to the roundtable with BFX and Whaleclub last few days you're the sheep getting fleeced.

by the time a class action is organized the people behind bfx will be long gone and hiding out in thailand. only reason they are settling w/ the really big whales on bfx is because they don't want to live the rest of their lives in fear, however small holders have neither the means nor the organizational abitlity to coerce them in any way. as such they have no real leverage. 
this is going to be similar to the mtgox bankruptcy where they key players get off scotfree and everyone else takes socialized losses. unfortunate as that is, that's bitcoin for you. worse case BFX board elects a fall guy to go to jail and negotiate with the big players for their security and protection in exchange for some protection money.

Because how is that Chinese person going to find a buyer for his Bitcoins without advertising that hes selling on some public exchange or website. Ofc the counter argument to this would be that so long as the Chinese person privately knows individuals that will buy his Bitcoins in foreign countries then he has no problem. However the counter argument to that is that there is no guarantee that the person you've privately made a deal with will agree to his end of the bargain especially once he's gained the leverage of knowing that you're attempting to bypass capital controls. He could just as easily take your Bitcoins then report you to the Chinese authorities and have them deal with you. Currently local Bitcoin exchanges rely on Escrow however that introduces the third party which CAN be coerced into spying on their users by powerful government entities. Like I said Bitcoin is actually weaker than cash right now if you want to use it for money laundering/escaping capital controls.

LBC and apps like Mycelium cannot protect Bitcoin from increased government scrutiny. It is becoming more and more clear with every day that one of the use cases most commonly attributed to increased bitcoin adoption (money laundering) is actually an area where Bitcoin is increasingly non-competitive in. However Bitcoin is still extremely dominant in terms of DarkWeb economic activity. However I no longer see Bitcoin as an effective measure against capital controls.

Hell no lols, Canadian banks are super wary of Bitcoin and bascially anthing new.

If you're a whale and you do large transactions this doesn't work as they will follow you through multiple hops. For the casual bettor sure.

If you're a whale ask a whale friend, if you're not it doesn't matter.
