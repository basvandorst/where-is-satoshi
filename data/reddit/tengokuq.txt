A trusted source, he gave me the money and now it disappeared from the " Pending balance "
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:11:10
And how do I avoid these kind of mistakes in the near future?

This is my account address :
Account website : 
I am not making this up, I went to bitcoin wallet, made an account, the guy sent me the money, had it pending yesterday and lost it today, I have the tx hash, and hash 160. I basically have the blockchain info.. Dunno if that's useful 
@_date: 2016-10-27 09:23:30
Hey man, just letting you know that I got my money, one thing though. Whenever I want to send money to buy stuff they tell me that there another transaction in progression even though I don't have others in progress, something wrong?
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:30:26
I wrote the hash and everything up in the comments
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:55:21
So approx after one day I am going to get my money? Are they going to show up in Bitcoinwallet? Sorry if I keep repeating myself over and over :/ 
@_date: 2016-10-27 12:54:02
Was I supposed to write a paragraph? I am posting in need of help. If you're not helping then just move on :)

I have no experience whatsoever in these stuff, I used to be a Counter striker global offesnive trader, made money trading stuff and decided to cashout my stuff. Saw this had the " Trading exchange " and went for it :/ I have the address and the hash, dunno if that'll help 
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:57:31
That's the thing, I lost the transaction ID. I can't track it back..
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:01:09
Thank you so much.. Is there a way where I can get the money instantly instead of waiting?
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:58:27
Trading exchange, it was fine yesterday, I suddenly lost the money just now.
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:35:45
Is that enough? 
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:29:58
I got the transaction from the game trader's bot(which is trusted, this guy's link  )
using bitcoinwallet(dunno which) just went to the website " bitcoin wallet.com" and made the account. That's all what I have/know. I made the account yesterday.
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:48:23
hey I am really sorry to bother you but I really need help with this thing. Apparently I lost 0.019 btc(around 14$) And I haven't done anything beside waiting.. Is there a way to track the money to whoever got it?

Do you mind if I give you a feed back tomorrow? Incase things didn't turn out good :)
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:46:42
So I am going to get it eventually? How long do I have to wait?
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:44:28
Hey mind helping me out a bit ? I had 16$ in my " Pending balance " yesterday, I logged in 10 mins ago and saw neither my balance nor my pending balance have that amount of money, where did it go? ._.

Ah .. I see.. Will do that next time, thank you! :)
@_date: 2016-10-28 17:08:05
how can I know if it showed in my account?
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:01:31
I went back to history and found the tx hash, date. Dunno if that'll help though
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:53:46
Any clue why it keeps saying that I have another transaction in progress? Been trying for hours now to figure it out :c
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:56:10
I got this from a big trader in a game, he's trusted.
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:48:56
I thought it was necessary in order to make transactions. I have a pending balance since yesterday waiting it to get confirmed. Can I / do I have to do something to confirm it? I am new to BTC. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:53:17
bitcoinwallet.com, same place I logged in yesterday, had my 16$ as " Balance pending "
