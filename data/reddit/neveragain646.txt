6000 is the bottom. People don't want to sell below 6000, it's been like this for months. Gonna take a couple of years before bitcoin goes back to 20.000. So hold and do something productive with your life in the meantime.

You are right. There needs to be macro-economic reasons to invest in BTC, and these reasons aren't here yet. But they will come once inflation hits the economy and the stockmarket prices fall due to slowing down of the economies. 
The demand in btc isn't falling, it's stabilizing. So unless catastrophic events happen like massive regulations, this is pretty much the bottom. But there is no new demand, that's true. The demand will come though, once the western economies slow down.

People shift to ther things if the utility is higher than what they have now. Problem with btc is that it's not reliable as a daily currency. You want to buy coffee and suddenly the price drops with 10 percent. So, atm it's not a reliable currency. It's either something you specualte on or a currency, it cannot be both. Btc coud be a daily currency in the future if price stabilizes, but we are probably far away from that moment, and that's a good thing, cause we want to make gains.

It's psychologically nearly impossible to have a new bullrun after the biggest bullrun in the history of human mankind and after such a big crash. It all depend on demand. You have to wait till crypto gets adopted by society slowly. It can take a couple of years, but sure something like etf being granted could lead to amedium bullrun. Even during the bearmarket between 2013 and 2016, there were periods where it went up. Don't forget that average joe boosted the price at the end of 2017, and he's nowhere to be seen right now. So either institutional money comes in or average joe comes back, both are highly unlikely in short term.

Nah, crypto are highly speculative. The reason people go from alts to btc now is because of the bearmarket. They were right speculating on alts in 2017 and now they are right going back to btc again.  We all know 99 percent of alts are going to die. But it's still worth a try speculating on some of them. That being said, things can change any time in crypto.

Really? It takes a day or more before my money is transfered to someone else through bank, and if i want to wire it to other countries, sometimes a couple of days. In the weekend two days. The fees on paypal and my credit card are very high. It's an outdated system. I'm not even talking about the altcoins. They could solve many many real life problems, for example corruption when money from ngos is directly wired to the ones who need it instead of passing through corrupt governments. You'll say 'but they can use a bankaccount'. That's the problem, 2 billion people don't have a bank account, the only way to reah them is through crypto and mobile phone. Many other things: reducing energy costs with something like power ledger, where people can trade energy together, reducing many many other costs. This will be the biggest revolution since the internet. The moment cryptos are gong to be adopted by the mainstream, you'll see big big changes. Within a couple of years, governments are going to actually stimulate cryptos and cryptocompanies. , because it's going to take the ecoomy to another level, it's going to make it way, way more efficient. It's also going to elevate the standard of living in thrid world countries. For the first time, they will have the opportunity to enter a global financial market, as equals. Tremendous advantages.

The most worrying thing is that nothing has been done in 2018. Hardly new regulations and adoption level of crypto has been lowered.

Just bought more bitcoin. Interest level has flattened, which of course is the best time to buy - when volatility is gone. Good to see that price always follows interest, which gives me the mathematical certainty that bitcoin can't fall below 5800 in 3 or 4 weeks time. The rules are very simple, but we are too stupid to follow the rules, let alone block our impulses. Increase of bitcoin to 20.000 will take 4-6 years, so i will have 300% gains. Great investment. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 20:58:39
Certain criteria must be met before a new bullrun occurs: 
* The stockmarket must crash
* There must be an economic recovery after a recession in order for people to look for new ways to invest
* There must be adoption of crypto into everyday life
* The milennium generation must obtain their degrees and enter the labormarket
* Goverments and institutions must adopt crypto to a certain degree
* Online companies like Google and Facebook must give full access to advertiement of cryptocompanies
This is going to take aprroximately 3 to 5 years. Bitcoin could rise to 20.000 again in 2022, which will make it a great investment if you invest now.

No we won't. Trust me, this is not possible, as much as you want it. Only extremely bad news can cause this, and even then, the price will go up again to over 6000. Because it all has to do with the level of interest. Price follows interest. The interest level is pretty much stable between 11 and 7 on a scale of 100 the past 7 months. The chance of a sudden drop in interest from 8 (current level) to 5 in one week, which will bring the price to something like 5000-5500, is close to zero. You just don't understand. Maybe in 2 or 3 months, the price can drop to 5000 because of declining interest. But not in one or two weeks. This is based on google data on interest. I said the same a couple of days ago, that the price cannot drop below 5800 right now. Before the crash. You can look up my post. It's all based on data 
@_date: 2018-10-30 01:37:58

Price follows interest. Interest is at 7 out of 100 at the moment. Price can't fall below the pricelevel that corresponds with interest level. If you compare the current price at the current level of interest with the price at the same level of interest a year ago, you'll see it was the same price. No more proof is needed to understand that price follows interest. So btc could hypothetically fall to 4000 in two weeks, but the price will bounce back to approximately 6000-6500. Cause that's the pricelevel that corresponds with the level of interest.

I have predicted the future, the 2018 bearmarket in january 2018, when everyone was saying price will go up to 50.000 this year. Same goes for the guy with technical analyses about Elliot wave, who's being hated here, while he predicted everything right.
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:16:30
It's almost impossible to go lower than 5500. Price follows the interest. Interest is at 7 out of 100 (in december). Lowest point in 16 months. But you need an interest level of 5 to go under 5500, which is unlikely to happen so quickly (maybe in 2 months). Numbers are based on google trend. Price follows the interest. Number one basic economic rule. 5500 is the new bottom based on the interest though.
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:23:36
No, i need to be realistic, being negative or positive = subjective feeling and should not lead ones decisions. There hasn't been as much positive news about btc as in the last 8 months, it did nothing positive. Positive news doesn't matter, as long as market sentiment is bad and as long as there's no interest from the mass. The only thing that matters is interest. Price follows interest. You need to see an uptrend in interest. This depends on exposure and market sentiment. The time isn't ready for btc for a new bull. The last bearperiod lasted 3 years, this one could last longer. This is called realism.  
@_date: 2018-10-12 00:55:27

Stockmarkets going down. It's going to tak 6 to 12 months before real economy gets hit. Then 2 or 3 bad years. So in appr. 4 to 6 years, there might be a new crypto revival and new bullrun. IF there is a considerable amount of adoption. Great opportunity to invest now and wait 6 years before 50 or 100 percent gain. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 09:51:03
It's certainly not a bullish signal. Looking at the past btc can go sideways for a long time. Also, the past bullperiods were in periodes when nobody really knew how much real value crypto had. When things go up in those speculative periods, you can get mass hysteria. In a few years, we will know more about the true value of crypto, so i don't expect new mass hysteria. I expect btc to reach a value of Lets say 20.000 in a few years. Pretty much the same pattern as online businesses in the 2000s. 20.000 in 5 years is still a very good investment if you invest now and i doubt any other market will reach 120 percent gains in a period of 5 years.
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:59:07
Price slowly going back to its natural level (6200), which is logical, as price follows interest and there's no increase in interest in Bitcoin. Every breakout will follow by a dropdown if there's no increased interest.

I agree with the last part. People still invest in .com businesses like Facebook and google. It's just different. There's no mass hysteria anymore and no massive gains.

If the .com bubble wasn't a crash, i don't know what a crash is. It took microsoft 16 years before reaching the ath of 2000 again. People live 74 years by average. 16 years is a quarter of their life. I don't now how long people can wait before btc rises to ath of 20.000 again, but most people don't understand how exceptional 20.000 was. It was exceptional because so many people were investing in bitcoin. 5% in western countries is very very high. In 3 weeks time in december so many people from the mass jumped in. One should ask the question: where will new money come from. The vast majority of people just don't like crypto nor bitcoin and will never like it. Also, search results for crypto dropped since january. It was the first time the search results dropped since the launch of bitcoin. It means crypto hit the ceiling. It will be very very difficult to breach the ceiling, and the past 10 months proved this.

Institutional money? You think that banks and retirement funds are going to gamble with people's money in a highly volatile market? Never ever gonna happen.

@_date: 2018-10-26 04:57:38
Volatility is gone, which usualy is the best entry point. But something tells me this flat line could last forever. Still, it's the best entrypoint. 90 percent of peoplle, including me, are dumb though, and don't invest when volatility is low. They invest when price drops or when it climbs. Both dumb strategies. One should always invest in low volatility periods.

Like I said a couple of days ago, btc is slowly going back to its natural pricelevel (6200), which corresponds to the interestlevel. Price follows interest. Every outbreak that is not followed by new investors, will lead to pricedrop to previous level, untill nobody wants to sell. Around 6000 is where it's going to stay for a couple of years, maybe it drops back to 5000 in 2019 due to declining interest. As long as average joe is not willing to step in, no significant price increase wil happen. Average joe = your God and emperor.
@_date: 2018-10-11 13:55:12
It's more like the .com bubble cause all crypto crashed not just one company. It's better to compared it with Microsoft. It took Microsoft 16 years to get back at ath of 2000. It could take a long time for btc as well. Maybe not 16 years, but 4 or 5 years. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 05:44:13
Flat = Ideal time to invest. Don't look at price but at volatility. Once volatility is gone and the line becomes flat, that is the time to invest. It may take another 6 months or maybe 2 or 3 years before  another bullrun, but always invest when it's flat.

you are right but it's not only the American economy. you deal with world economy as well. If price of oil rises for example, companies will have a problem. But you just deal with normal economic cycles. An economy can have just so much growth during a peak period. Then things get overheated, companies will have problems hiring people, consumer expense drops etc. I don't think a big recession will come, just a bit of lower growth, which is normal. In the long run, you still deal with the invention of the internet, which will have a very long positive impact on the economy, like 50 years or so.

point 2 happened, point 3, 4,5 didn't need to happen cause it was another phase of crypto, point 6 didn't happen, but if it happened, no bullrun could have occured. The past bullruns are not the same. There will never be mass euphoria of the mass about crypto again. That only happens once. Average joe got in in december, got out in january, and will never come back investing into crypto without gradual adoption, something you didn't need before 2018. Without adoption now, average joe won't come back. One thing is for sure: you need average joe or his money through institutions. You didn't need average joe at the 2013 ath.

That doesn't mean price will go up. It can take a long time before it goes up again. 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, even 5 years. Look at the pricegraph after bearrun of 2013-2015. Long sideway track. This time the bearrun probably will be longer

Blokchain will be implemented in many companies and governments the coming years. It will take some time before a new bullrun. It will come AFTER an economic crisis or the coming recession, which will force governments and govermental organizations to be more effective. They way they will do that is blockchain. Blockchain will be actively promoted by governments. They have no choice. The question is: how will the price of btc augment because of the new blockchain society? That is the big question, nobody knows. But chances are btc will become more popular, just for the fact societies and businesses will transform into blockchain societies and businesses. I do not believe in hype-bullruns though. Next bullrun is based on adoption and implementation, not on crazyness and speculative value.

Nobody Will convert into btc risking to lose half of its value in one minute.
 Secondly: yes, this will happen. Companies will transform their system into blockchain, saving alot of money. I don't know if that's possible for companies like visa and MasterCard though.
It doesn't matter for Bitcoin, btc won't be a currency until it loses volatility. It will probably be only digital gold. So if more and more blockchain adoption takes place in companies, it will schine on btc.

It is based on google trend data, which is extremely reliable. Proof is the google trend graph follows the price graph very closely. The price drop the past 7 months is due to declining interest and nothing else.  You can look up yourself. I'm willing to bet all my money that the price won't drop below 5000-5500 next week. In other words, there won't be another big crash next week. Price could drop to 5000 in the course of weeks or months, but it's extremely unlikely that a sudden big fall happens again, and if it happens, price will go up again very fast to the same level because of interest level. You look at past crash of crypto in 2013, and the big pattern is the same. After a big crash, a long sideways movement happens. Same goes with other big crashes, for example the stockmarket in 2000. Once high volatility is gone, there is usually no big danger anymore. When volatility is gone, it's the best moment to invest. Most speculators are gone. Ironically, this is the moment where the least amount of persons invest.

2-3 years, maybe 4 years or even 5 years. Gonna take a hell of a long time before it starts to go up. Won't go up before some coins get adpoted by society and blockchain becomes part of life. This Will probably take 4-5 years.

No because during the bearmarket of 2013-2015, it went down slowly over the course of months (although there was a small minibullrun during that period). But the price probably won't go down much i guess.

But but i thought price increase would lead to more interest and average joe would jump in to invest and btc would go to 20.000  and everything would be okay? Cause that's what they all say, right? Interest follows price? Right? 
@_date: 2018-10-14 08:40:04
Price follows interest. Not whales, not Tether, not anything else. Google and Facebook blocking ads and less msm coverage caused a massive drop in exposure and interest in 2018, which is the only reason the price dropped. Now that google opened up the possibility for ads again, and Facebook did the same, there might be coming more interest again if cryptocompanies spend money on ads. But you have to take human psychology into account also. After ath + crash, it's very unlikely a new ath follows so shortly after it. More likely, sideway movement will continue till after economic recession (end of 2019) and when crypto shows uservalue, which might take a couple of years or might never come.
@_date: 2018-10-14 21:20:19
Yes, the price could go down. The price goes down until the point there is no incentive to sell anymore. There was incentive to sell in january, because of cashing out. There is no real incentive to sell right now, cause there's nothing to cash out. The price might slowly go down in the course of months because of slow decline of interest, but we probably pretty much hit the bottom. Let's say the bottom is 5000 in april 2019 or something like that. If btc has another bullrun in 2022, you must invest now if this is the bottom. or wait a bit. Another crash like in january is highly unlikely. It basically almost never happens, unless an asset just dissappears after a big crash. If you believe btc will dissappear, then obviously you must not invest in it now. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 01:23:06
From 6000 to 20.000 = average joe. Everyone else holded and has invested in btc. I'm begging for average joe to be so stupid to invest in btc again, but of course average joe is stupid but not that stupid. So we're fucked.

Blockchain certainly makes the whole economy more efficient. I think the function of Bitcoin Will be the one of digital gold. The only problem is that society doesn't have confidence in btc at the moment. But the longer it exists and doesn't die, the more confidence there will be.

You have some points, but the past is the past. This asset/coin has been touched by the mass. Once that happens, it's a different ballgame. If you look at december, how many people were investing in it. We're talking about aunts and uncles that never heard of btc before. Average joe. That's really the maximum this speculative coin can achieve for now. Now, if you're talking about adoption as a payment method, the only way it can be a payment method is if there's no volatility. If there's no volatility, it can't give huge gains. It's one thing or the other, it cannot be both.
Also, the reason of the huge gains in 2017 were that nobody knew what the real value of btc and crypto was. As time goes by, we will learn what the real value is. The real value is always lower than the speculative value in bullish speculative periods when the value isn't known, untill it slowly and gradually goes up. You only have to look at the past to see this pattern. See online companies in 2000s for example. We pretty much know what the value of Microsoft is now, so there will never be a huge price increase like in 1999. Btc is probably the same. Once the real (practical) value is known, there is no reason to speculate so much on it, cause speculation is based on expectation. This expectation was huge in 2017 and probably won't come back. Again, if you're talking about btc as a payment method, adoption could grow. But it cannot be a payment before volatility is gone.

I hope people understand, in order to make wise decisions, that the january crash IS the .com bubble for crypto. Every new technology goes through this bubble of overinflated prices compared to intrinsic value. It happend with online businesses, the railroad bubble, the radiobubble etc. People who don't understand this pattern think that btc could suddenly have a bullrun towards 100.000 within a year. This is simply impossible, cause every new technology goes through the same pattern. After a new technology is adopted, it takes many many years before the intrinsic value reaches the ath value of the bubble again. For example, it took Microsoft 16 years to reach ath of 2000. If btc is adopted, it's still a good investment, but price will slowly increase during adoptionstage instead of having a crazy bullrun again. This is how the pattern works and there's no technology in the world that can escape this pattern.  BTC reaching 12000 in 2021 would be an extremely good performance and probably the best investment if you compare it to investing in Gold or stocks. But how much bubble compared to intrinsic value was there in cryptospace? Alot of empty air. Companies raising 20 billion is just insane. Alot of empty air must go. Remember: from now on, it's not about specualtion anymore. It's about intrinsic value and adoption. Obviously, when you have so much overinflated prices, it's going to take a very very long time before the intrinsic value reaches the ath bubble value. Most cryptos will never even be able to reach this value, even if they're succesfull. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 00:49:29
I don't call the amount of people that were investing in december small. On average 5.5 percent of western population at ath is really not small but huge. How many people invest in gold? I'm sure it's not even 5.5 percent. 
You also have to take into consideration time. There is a speculation period for everything. Then you get adoption (or not). The speculation period is where the big gains are made. Everyone is afraid to miss the boat. That feeling and hype can simply not come back in the same way cause after a while we will know the true value of crypto. It's when people don't know what the true value is, that big gains are made. It took Microsoft 17 years to get back at ath of 2000. Cryptotime is faster, so let's say 4-6 years before btc is back at ath. Still a good long term investment but crazy times are over.

I guarantee you, a million positive articles and extremely positive news the coming 6 months, STILL won't get him back. He'll ONLY come back if, and only if crypto is partially adopted.
20.000 is EXTREMELY high. We needed MASSIVE amount of publicity to get that price. I mean, it was MASSIVE. That's how much exposure you need to get back at 20.000. Bitcoin must be the talk of the town, people must talk about it at birthday parties, msms daily reports, 5 billion ico ads a month on facebook, etcetera etcetera. That's how much HYPE needs to be created to get back at 20.000. People can't imagine how much exposure btc needs to get back to 20.000. It won't happen within 3 months, won't happen within 6 months, not within a year. It can only happen when there's a major shift or crisis in the economy.

People are afraid of a big Bitcoin crash. I hope people understand that this is mathematically almost impossible, no matter what happens. If you look at how fast the interest dropped during the big crash in january, it dropped from the level of 100 to 46 in 2 weeks time. And then from 58 to 19 in february. Because of miners and average joe cashing out. The interest level between june and october is almost a horizontal line, ranging between 10 and 8. It's almost impossible for btc to have another big crash. For that to happen, the interestlevel must drop to something like 4 or 5 in 2 weeks. That won't happen, cause we're dealing with a horizontal interest line and there's nothing to cash out like in january. I hope people finally understand that price always follows interest. Now, will there be another bullrun in short term? Of course not. That's like saying could there have been a bullrun so close after the .com bubble? That's almost impossible, cause you deal with market sentiment. Why would anybody wants to stand on a vulcano shortly after an eruption? You'd want to stand on it after a couple of years, when new flowers and bushes have grown. Same for Bitcoin. It will take approximately 4-6 years before a new bullrun. That's how much recoverytime human brain needs to recover from the biggest crash in human history.

We've got to be more realistic about crypto and blockchain. Everyone is expectating big gains like 900 or 1000 percent a year. Those days are over though, and will never come back. What's wrong with earning 100 or 200 dollars in a year on a 3000 dollar investment anyway? That's still way more than you'll get when placing your money in a bank. The most modern societies and governments like in South Korea are slowly beginning to adopt blockchain. Altcoins? Not so much.  Only a couple of them may have a future. The rest is pretty much useless, maybe only to gamble. Everyone can make a blockchain. It's going to be easy in the future.

That is what's happening and that's what will happen for the coming weeks/months. I've been saying this since february and got the same responses as yours. Bitcoin investors have simply no clue of how the market works. They think universal market principles don't apply to crypto, they live in a parallel universele like Kanye West.

Macro economic forces will drive crypto demand. The economic crisis was THE reason Bitcoin began climbing. The macro economic factors aren't favourable at the moment. Normal economy is doing good. So there's no reason for anyone to invest in crypto right now. That's why there's no interest whatsoever. Once economic recession kicks in, you'll see people searching for alternative ways to invest. Problem is, banks have taken measurements after the crisis, so it's unlikely a new banking crisis emerges. We have to wait till something happens. Imagine something like Lira downfall happens with the dollar. It won't happen so soon, but it would be ideal for btc. You would see a major shift from dollars to btc, topping the ath of btc for sure. The question is not if a big shift will happen, but when...

He's completely right in his argument, saying the transacion fees are ridiculously high and there's an oligopoly of miners, controling everything (centralization). BTc makes the rich people richer according to Roubini, and unfortunately, it's true. There must be change. But it doeszn't matter what Roubini says anyway.

The price follows the interest (not the other way around ofcourse). Interest is at the score of 7 out of 100 (december) right now. The lowest score in 16 months. The only positive thing is, it Wlwill probably not go down much more. You have to wait for a new economic crisis, and then 2 or 3 more years before btc goes up to 20.000 again. Could take 6-10 years.

So logically, there will be a setback now. 
Bt this won't have influence on btc anyway, cause crypto already crashed. I think the only thing that could influence btc on a macro economic level is a huge recession/crash like that of 2008, or huge inflation, making people shift their money to crypto.

The Bottom might be 5000 in 4 or 5 months, but for now it cannot crash again like in january. Why? Because of the big drop of interest in january after ath. Price follows the interest.

You see, the problem right now is lack of exposure. You compare it to december: 5 billion crypto and ico ads a month flying all over facebook and google, msm exposure, millions of people seeing btc everywhere. You think you're going to to fill up a gap of 5 billion crypto ads a month with a price rise of 30%? You're wrong.  Crypto interest is flat for months now, while the price went up many times.

You think average joe is going to invest in Btc because of bakkt? He doesn't even know what it is. Only way to increase btc price is heavy adoption, which is not what's happening right now. Banks and businesses cut out their btc payment methods, so adoption level dropped. The thing that could save btc is blockchain adoption by governments and organizations, which will take a couple of years. You can invest now, wait 5 years and you'd maybe have doubled your investment when btc is at 12000, which would be a fantastic achievement.

Fact 1: the mass doesn't like speculation. Only few of them invest in stocks, and even they are afraid of stocks losing value. The mass likes safety. Some of them invested in crypto, cause this time they couldn't resist (same as .com in 1999). There will never ever be mass adoption of crypto as a speculative asset. Never. Fact 2: bitcoin is either a speculative asset or a payment method. It cannot be both. You won't buy bread with a coin that can lose half of its value in one minute. If it remains a speculative asset, the price of 20.000 in december is extremely high. Going back to that price is going to be very very difficult, because you simply need average joe, who lost money on crypto and tends to not come back and doesn't like speculation. Fact 3: institutions won't invest in crypto as long as volatility is so high. Not a single institution is going to gamble with people's money (retirement funds, banks). Way too risky and governments won't allow it. If btc loses it's volatility and institutions step in, it cannot bring big gains anymore. This is pure logic. If you think about these things, the conclusion is very simple: it's going to be a hell of a job to get back at 20.000 and might take years or never happen. And by the way, what is wrong with btc attaining 20.000 in 2022. It's a fantastic ROI if you invest now. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 21:30:07

Hittng 20.000 in december after a 900 percent bull was an extraordinary bullrun. It's going to take years to get back at that level. I think we can call it the cryptobubble in 10 years, like the .com bubble. It's going to get back to Ath, but it's probably going to take 5-10 years or something like that. Still a good investment if you invest now. Someday, btc will maybe be 100.000
@_date: 2018-10-14 23:33:03
Of course there is evidence. Google search results tell you everything. Huge spike in december. It means new investors came in. Akmost all of them dropped out in december. This can only be average joe and not the crypto fanboy. 
Adoption as a payment method can only occur if btc loses its speculation value. It cannot be a speculative asset as well as a payment method. Would you want to buy a cup of coffee if the price could go up from 2 to 4 dollars in 20 seconds? It's either one or the other. If it becomes an adopted payment method, that means it would have lost its volatility and won't be interesting to make big profits. If it's still a speculative asset, it cannot become a payment method, thus it would be very difficult to be adopted by the mass (the mass doesn't like speculation - only a small part invests in stocks and gold). It means the price of 20.000 is extremely high and attaining that price again would be fantastic but very difficult, cause average joe doesn't come back so quickly to speculate a second time and get his ass burned again. We have seen it with .com companies. It took Microsoft 16 years to come back at ath. Same goes for other .com companies. The only difference is that Microsoft and Google already had VALUE. Google had a great search engine which displayed great utility. Microsoft had hotmail and other great products, which were used. Bitcoin? The question remains: what is the real value of it? Even after the .com bubble, Google had value, but we can't say the same about bitcoin and crypto. The only thing that has true value now, and even the biggest enemies of crypto acknowledge this (Roubini), is blochchain. But there's a difference between blockchain and crypto. It could well be that all crypto fails but blochcain survives. Remains institutions: institutions will never ever invest in crypto if high volatility remains. No big institution in the world is going to gamble with people's money (retirement funds, big banks). Way too risky and they're not interested in short term gains but long gradual gains. The stockmarket is ideal for them and poses way less risks. They have no incentive to enter crypto. If they'll enter, volatility would be very low and the time of big gains would be over. You have to think logical instead of being a fanboy. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:50:23
Lol. Are you that stupid? You think average joe is looking at the price every minute, like you do? First he reads something about Bitcoin in the newspaper or hears about it on tv, which spikes interest, THEN he looks at the price, then he buys. Interest first, then price increase. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 19:36:26
I hear people say: but bakkt, but LN etc. Remember: it's buy the rumours, sell the news. Bakkt is already part of the price. There is positive news though: btc can't fall below 5800 in the next couple of weeks. The line has flattened. Level of interest is 8 out of 100 (lowest point in 1.5 years). As price follows interest, it's almost mathematically impossible to drop from level 8 to let's say 5 in 3 weeks. You can safely invest in Btc without losing much money the coming 3 weeks. 'But but you cannot prediction the future, you idiot'. Yeah, just like i couldn't predict the fact btc couldn't fall below 5800 3 weeks ago and everyone was yelling that btc would drop to 5000 (which is mathematically impossible to happen so quickly when we deal with a flat interest line after a crash in january).

4 percent = 1 in 25 people. Of course you won't find people who invested that easily. Doesn't mean 4 percent isn't high. But let's put the percentage aside.

I still believe in the technology, especially blockchain. I'm in it for the money, i do not care about changing the system, people get the system they want, and if it's a centralized system cause it fits their need, it will be that.

It was the biggest hype in human history with the highest potential payout ever. The fall was to be expected and is going to be very very painful for a lot of people, including me. Now that it fell under 6000 everything is possible. It could go back to 1000 if the bearmarket lasts 2-3 or more years. Alot of altcoins are going to bleed to death, they are worth zero. Lisk, power ledger, reddcoin etc.: zero value on the market. Way too much money still in the marketcap - empty air that has to be released. MC can go down another 50-60 percent.

People are complaining that the price of btc doesn't go up and we can't breach 6600. Actually, the facts are, the bottom was 6000 this year, it went up to 6500. Everyone is waiting for bullruns, mass hysteria etc., but it's actually far more healthy if there's a gradual climbing. After the biggest mania in human history and a monstercrash, a sideways movement or gradual climbing is extremely positive. Also, this IS the time to invest. Low volatility, low volume = IDEAL for long time investors. Take advantage of it, cause when there's a short spike again, you might be too late. You look at previous spikes, and you see it goes very quickly up and then crashes. You have almost no time to react properly. Now, you have all the time.

The technology is not bitcoin, it's blockchain. People are beginning to realize that the value of bitcoin was based on the belief in bitcoin, but believing is not enough to sustain value. If i find a stone and you want to buy it for 3 dollars, and then you convince someone else that it's 4 dollars, this can continue until people ask themselves: what the hell can we do with a stone? At the moment, there are no benefits in btc: transaction costs aren't lower than fiat transfer, it has high volatility, so you can't buy anything with it. So the big question is: what is it's real value?

You're going to lose all your money, cause you're looking at your imaginary neighbour and say to yourself: i'm going to do something when he does something. Then, it's already too fcking late.

Zero adoption. Adoption = using to buy goods or services. Nobody does that, because nobody wants to pay for a cup off coffee that suddenly costs 8 dollars more the next morning. Even criminals don't use it anymore. It's a catch 22 situation. You need more adoption to make it less volatile, but in order to get more people adopt it, it needs to lose it's volatility. Another fundemental flaw is that if volatility drops and coins are used as a currency, they aren't interesting anymore for speculation, so holders will sell it or drop it. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 07:43:34


That is a possibility, but in the end, the client decides. If the client wants btc or there is potential demand for btc, as a company, you should fullfill their demand. Also, they could offer both, as well as other established cryptos in their portfolio. So the story is not banks versus crypto. Btc has the brand, the universal usage etc. So to say banks could start their own crypto and just dismiss the nr. 1 crypto is not smart if there is demand for it.

I really don't understand the weird reasoning and emotional reactions from certain btc and crypto investors (most of them to be honest). They get angry because some people decide to invest in Bitcoin cash or forks. As an investor, you are NOT supposed to be emotionally attached to anything. If there are investors who want to invest in altcoins, then this is a reality or even a possibility to deal with. Bitcoin is not your wife or kid. You are not supposed to defend it, no matter what happens, what kind of crazy stuff is that? I have never seen so much irrationality when it comes to crypto. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:07:24
The price didn't fell because of that. The price simply fell because people moved some of their btc into bchsv and babc. Then the price dropped, others sold, it dropped further, hitting long time holders and some miners, who sold, falling further.

There is a fundemental cryptocrisis at the moment, that is, not one of the coins is used to buy goods, not even criminals use it because of high volatility. I talked yesterday with someone who had Monero and he said: but you have to wait till Monero has more people in it. More people owning Monero leads to less volatility. But even if Monero got more owners and reaches for example the MC of btc, it still would have massive volatility, cause btc still has volatility.

You are completely right but you can't have a discussion with someone who's not an investor but a believer/cult member. Remember that most btc holders are cult members, not investors. I'm one of the few owning bitcoin who isn't a cult member. On the other hand: it's good to have these cult members, they won't sell their bitcoin, maybe only when a nuclear world worldwar breaks out. Same goes for other crypto holders. If you understand their mindset, you'll understand why people like Hitler and the nazi-party became so popular. All these Telegram groups and Reddit groups are extremely fanatical. Every dissident is being attacked, every critical opinion is being deleted, people with a critical mindset are being banned. It is 1942 with a modern touch, digital totalitarism. If you understand these groups, you'll understand that it wasn't Hitler's fault, it was the mass. The mass is way more dangerous than a dictator. They want totalitarism, they want to ban different opinions, they accept no opposition. Fortunately, it's only about crypto. Imagine if it was about politics. Oh wait...

Volatility is dangerous and deceptive in bearmarkets. Volatility is only good in a bullmarket like last year. But with the volatility at the beginning of the year, lots of people lost their money. Besides, you have to go through a period of low volatility to go back to a bullmarket. Speculators must dissappear in order to reach the bottom.

Everyone was panicking 6 weeks ago. 'O, this is the end of Bitcoin, it's going to fall to 5000, help me!'. I said: 'don't worry, price follows interest'. 'It's going to stabilize around 6200'. Price can only fall to 5000 in the course of months. It's almost mathematically impossible to fall to 5000 in 1,2 or even 3 weeks when you're dealing with a flat or almost flat line. My predictions of btc are on spot since january. Everyone thought the bullmarket would continue in 2018. I said: 'no, price follows interest. Interest is gone. It's over for this year'. This is the .com bubble for crypto. How do I know? You need to follow the interest. For the first time in 10 years, search results of Bitcoin dropped. That's a huge indicator. It means we dealt with the .com bubble for crypto, and the hypermania is gone. This hypermania will never come back, like the .com mania never came back. Of course, everyone was angry. I'm predicting this shit the way it should be predicted. It's going to take 3 to 6 years before btc reaches ath again. This is what's going to happen. Of course, this post will lead to anger and agressive talk.

Is this a serious remark? I can sum up numerous things blockchain can make way more efficient. It can cut off middle men, it can cut off labour costs for companies by putting parts of their process on blockchain, it can cut off additional banking costs for companies, it can cut off labour costs for banks, it can stimulate entrepreneurship everywhere, especially in third world countries, it can bank the unbanked, it can lead to flow of money directly to the one who needs it, surpassing corrupt governments, it can cut off government costs, et cetera et cetera. The advantages are numerous and extreme. This is one of the most important inventions in human history and will make economies way, way more efficient and effective. You will see, in a couple of years, when societies and governments will shift to blockchain systems, how much it will change. It's not only about the financial system.
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:26:35
Already been researched. 5 percent in the US. Extremely high percentage for a speculative asset.

@_date: 2018-11-13 03:47:26
I don't think you've read enough whitepapers of cryptocurrencies to understand how precisely blockchain is going to revolutionize things, with all due respect. 
 
*Well not yet. If you want to do anything with your BTC you probably need to convert it to fiat via an exchange. That's less efficient. Do you have an appreciation of how much energy it takes to move a dollar on BTC vs VISA or SWIFT? Bitcoin is NOT an efficient payment network. It has other cool properties, but efficiency is not one of them.*
 
I'm not only talking about btc. I'm talking about blockchain. Imagine being able to sell and buy your energy as a household yourself like with power ledger, instead of passing through big energy companies. And there are many more examples like these in different domains. it will cut off many middle men and could even cause redistribution of wealth towards the middle class in the long term, something the current economic system clearly cannot achieve (the current system is extremely unequal, with wealth accumulated at the top and everyone else staying poor or stagnate). 
*Um what, that sounds like adding labour costs to me? Again, blockchain has some cool properties like trustlessness, but efficiency is not one of them.*
Quite the contrary. When companies work together when it comes to production lines for example, instead of each having their own centralized system, it will cut off costs and labour costs. Other examples are financial decentralization (instead of different centralized isolated systems within each different company) and IT decentralization et cetera. It will reduce costs.
 
*What are you talking about? Companies need to do three things, buy stuff, sell stuff, and pay their employees. This all happens in fiat. What savings are you talking about?*
I have a company. I pay fees to use payment systems. Banking fees. Some crypto have zero or almost zero fees. If you're a big company, just making your clients pay in for your service in crypto will cut off paying these fees. And when you sell alot, you cut off alot of fees.  
 
*It's about a decade too late. M-Pesa's pretty darn efficient and has a massive market share. Hard to see how Blockchain is going to make it more efficient.*
Didn't know Mpesa. Haven't done enough research about it to be honest. maybe you're right, don't know. 
 *Example please?*
Almost all government systems are centralized systems and because of this centralized system they constantly need to be monitored and controlled et cetera. Decentralizing systems on blockchain based on the blockchain trustless system will reduce their costs. Centralized systems are also prone to mistakes and corruption, adding indirect costs. One example is being able to vote through a blockchain system, from your own house, watching tv. There are current systems and countries where you can vote digitally, but these systems are prone to hackers and corruption, etc. A blockchain voting system is more reliable. The vote is registred on the blockchain and nobody can change it. 
*There's a single example in there that really makes sense (interbank transfers). Everything else is just propaganda.*
No, if you read my post you'll see i'm extremely critical. I don't like to make propaganda for btc nor crypto. 
I just don't think you understand the full possibilities of blockchain. You're only looking at the disadvantages instead of the possibilities. There is alot of progress still to be maid, and new problems will arise, but in the end, I think it's revolutionary. I can go into more detail with alot of whitepaper plans from cryptocompanies, but i advise you to read them yourself if you didn't do it. Some ideas are really well thought and satisfy needs. Meanwhile, stay critical of course, that's a good thing.

Agree. It's too manipulated and obscure. 2018 was a very bad year, and I'm not talking about the price. I'm talking about progress. Very little progress. This crash was to be expected, but the fundementals for a new bullrun are bad. Still too much manipulation, not easy to buy, declining public interest etc. Also, in fact one shouldn't talk about bullrun anymore, but adoption. Cryptos need to show their value in society. But you know how it goes, as we know from the .com bubble. Owners take the money, throw parties and post pics on Instagram. Only a few are willing to work hard. I absolutely do not agree with the general opinion here that all altcoins are shitcoins. Some of them fullfill an actual need that cannot be fullfilled by centralized systems. 90 percent of altcoins will die out though. I'm not positive about the current market. I expect at least another 2 years of bearmarket and btc might fall to 1-2k. Very harsh times ahead of us when it comes to cryptoprices. Things need to be weeded out, coins must die, blockchain must be adopted by governments etc. In the end, blockchain will make societies 50x more effective and moneyflow way more effective and efficient. Again, i'm extremely negative about the current market, but in the end, after the next economic crisis, governments and companies will look at new ways to make economies more efficient, and blockchain will be the way to go.

The bottom at the moment is around 3500-5000. It's likely to go up to 4800 instead of dropping further, unless something very negative happens again.

Here is the link where it says 8 percent (!) Of Americans own crypto, because people asked for the numbers. It's a HUGE percentage. 
The percentage of western people owning btc is 5 percent. An ENORMOUS amount of people own it. That's why this is not 2013. In order to get back at 20k you need HUGE exposure, one never seen before like in december. That's why people who got angry at me in february, when i said it's going to take a very long time, are simply wrong. They are still wrong cause they predict a bullrun in 2019. This is not going to happen, it goes against every logical thinking. All people predicting a bearmarket are right at the moment. You better stop being stubborn and start listeningen to people who's predictions are backed by facts. They are not here to shill or whatever, they simply state facts over and over again. The Elliot wave man was consistently right in his predictions, but was banned and cursed. Why? Because people can't stand the truth. 
People think it's normal that worthless cryptocompanies are being loaded with 80-100 million? Are you kidding me? They are hugely overrated. They are worth ZERO, extremely overhyped. Normal companies that operate for more than 20 years with very succesfull products don't even have a million to expand their services and have to take account of costs every day, and then you have these worthless cryptocompanies stacked with 800 million? This is insanity. They will implode, cause the local shoestore is worth more than all over of them combined. That's why it's going to be a very very long bearmarket. The market is overrated by 90 percent. 90 percent of MC must go to have a normal rating of the value of these companies. It's going to happen, going to take 3-6 years to let go of that empty air.

Crypto and blockchain was the invention that perfecty fits into the needs of the new generation. 
People need to invest during periods of LOW volatility. Not when price goes up, not when it goes down. LOW VOLATILITY. The time is now. It can go a bit lower, but you can't time the perfect moment.

That's why i say: price follows interest. And we're in a downward trend, with decreasing public exposure and interest, worsening image, no new investors etc. These tech btc cult members are living in a bubble. They don't know shit about public interest, image and demand. They are focused on technique and stuff, but nobody gives a shit about it, it's all hype. That's why all alts went up in 2017. Not because of good tech, but because of hype. You need hype, an upward swing in interest, and i don't see it coming in the coming years.

Enough people have bought it in december. Everyone was in it. They stepped out. More people will invest in it in the long run, when blockchain starts to have value in real life. Just not now. This period is for massive correction, the coming years. Things are highly overrated at the moment, including btc. Too many people in it compared to its real value and usefulness. It's correction time and that's why you see people stepping out of it.

To finish my previous post: money and companies and societies move towards cost effective methods and techniques. This is a basic principle of economics. If you understand blockchain, you know how much more effective and efficient it can make economies. So it's only a matter of time before the whole system works on blockchain, from governments to companies.  Now, what will be the role of btc in this system? You need to see btc as the symbol of this new system that will emerge. The dollar is the symbol of the old system, btc will be the symbol of the new system. The more blockchain will be adopted (governments and institutions are working on it everywhere), the more popular btc will become. It doesn't really matter if btc will become a good payment method. It is the symbol of a new system, and alot of people have TRUST in it, like people trust the dollar. This trust will rise. The more blockchain adoption, the more trust there will be in btc.

What is the prediction of Bitcoin going back to 20k? 5 years?10 years? Gonna be extremely difficult and the only way i see it happening is if banks and other institutional players are going to offer it to their clients as a possible part of their portfolio.  Of course big institutional players like banks and retirement funds are not going to gamble with people's money on a highly volatile market against their will, so the real big money is excluded. So it's going to be private money from clients that want to diversify their portfolio by taking a crypto portfolio. The problem is, banks hate crypto at the moment. Nevertheless, in the long run, I think it's an opportunity for them to earn more money, especially when the milennium generation enters the job market. They will be more open towards new forms of investment than the older generations. So, crypto is an opportunity for banks instead of a danger in the long run, and i think this is how banks must see this. Crypto will not replace banks, banks will adopt it but in a different way people think will happen. People will feel safer if they take a cryptoportfolio that is supervised by banks. They won't need to worry about losing private keys for example, or being hacked, and banks could earn additional fees. I see great opportunities in this way of working, and i think this is how it's going to happen. The question is, how long will it take. I personally think 3 to 5 years before banks change their attitude towards crypto, and this could lead to a new bullrun. At the moment, there is just too much risk and too much manipulation.

I agree that it can take a long time before a new bullrun, but there is nothing in society that could make society and economy 500% more effective and efficient than blockchain.

The big .com/crypto bubble. One of the biggest bubbles in human history. Unbelievable: 99.9% of companies in the top 500 have litterally ZERO value, yet are loaded with several 100 millions. It's going to take 5 to 10 years before intrinsic value of some of these coins matches value during speculative hype. Some of them will never reach it, even if they are succesfull. Value of most of the coins is way way overrated and still way too much money in it. There is room to pump out more empty air out of the market. Most of the coins will go down to close to zero. That is their real value.

We are past that point. Btc is not a viable form of currency. I don't know what the problem is. You want a viable currency, you buy Tether or another stable coin. Why should btc be a viable currency if you want to make money on it anyway? It's either a good investment opportunity/speculative asset or a ccurrency. It cannot be both.

The fact that it's not mooning now doesn't mean it's not a good investment opportunity or it's a bad situation. The fact the price is flat for a couple of months is actually a good thing after a crash. This is what you want to see after a crash. Every good investor will tell you the best moment to invest is when the volatility is gone. It means short time speculators pulled out and the market pretty much hit the bottom or is close to the bottom. It means people are numb/pessimistic or cynical about the market. No fomo, low volume. The best signs when you want to invest long term. Now, it would be different if the market imploded and btc was going down to zero. Then you deal with a tulip mania. It means nobody believes it has underlying value. The last crypto crash is like the .com bubble: weeding out bad projects, lots of people losing their money cause they invested in bad project, hypermania gone. One thing we learned about the .com bubble is it takes time before prices go back to all time highs. Luckily, ten years with .com businesses is like two years in crypto. So everything moves faster. It took Microsoft 15 years before reachibg ath of 2000 again. Let's say with btc it's going to take 3 to 6 years. Still a long time and it's difficult to have patience. But it is what it is

Volume of bchabc and bchsv is 240 million in total. No wonder Bitcoin fell. Where else should the money for these two forks come from? I'm pretty sure the bottom was reached based on the normal market trend and market sentiment, and based on the Google search results. But when you deal with forks, money can be shifted from within the market to these new coins. The moment the price of these two forks starts to fall, you'll see money shifted back to btc. They're being pumped at the moment by whales who had their money in btc and Bitcoin cash. Every new coin is being pumped by the devs/owners as well. Then the whole thing crashes because they take their money out, leaving bagholders behind.

April run was caused by sharia law announcement. People that were already into crypto invested more money in it, thinking a new bullrun was coming. Price was unsustainable though, cause it didn't attract new investors. It quickly went back to its natural pricelevel, corresponding with the level of interest. New investors = key. 
That being said, looking back at the april run: some coins made x 10 or even x 15. I mean, if you look back: what do you want more as an investor than x 10 or x 15? But people were still too bullish and greedy to acknowledge despite minispike, we were in a long term bearrun.

There are no possible bullish signs. What the hell are you talking about. Why can't people understand that as long as there is ZERO interest in btc, nothing will go up and it only can go DOWN. Now, the question is: is this a problem? Yes, when you want to get rich quickly. But that's not going to happen. We are in a BEARmarket. That means no interest, negative sentiment, correction, people selling their coins, no new investors, insecurity, criticism and cynism. It can take a LONG time before this kind of sentiment goes away. Especially after the .com/cryptobubble. That means speculation period is OVER. Why? Because once average joe steps into the game, like what happened with the .com bubble, the rules of the game change. Average joe steps in, gets burned and steps out. Now you have a problem, you have the big bubble, bursting. Cause average joe will NOT come back. He is not a holder, he never really believed in btc and actually he doesn't give a shit about it. He forgot about it a long time ago. That is why it's going to take a very long time to pass 20k again. The only way to pass this point, is when an asset proves to have VALUE in real life. Its intrinsic value needs to climb in order to match the fake bubble value during hype/mass hysteria. In this case, it means adoption of blockchain. That is when companies are going to see VALUE in things, and when companies see value in a technology, it's a different ballgame. Governments will start to see value in it, and eventually society as a whole. Now, it's not difficult to see the value of .com companies. Crypto? Alot has to change for it to become valuable. There are too much problems that need to be solved. It's going to take time. 2,3,4,5 maybe 6 years. Will btc reach 100k one day? Maybe/probably. But not any tim soon. The ones who have the most patience always win the investment game.

Don't underestimate macro-economic factors. A big economic crisis might change the game. That is the reason btc was created in the first place.

Dropping to 4500-5000 over the course of several months/years is a possibility. Nobody is interested in crypto anymore, so there are no new investors. From 7000 to 20.000 = average joe, who will not come back. 4 percent of western world has already invested in btc, which is a huge proportion for a speculative asset, considering the fact btc will never become a currency (at least not in the coming 50 years). I'm sure gold doesn't reach 4 percent. The fact that big institutional investors never were interested in crypto and will not be interested in crypto for the coming years, means we have a problem. Cause if average joe doesn't come back and institutional investors don't want to invest in crypto, where will new money come from? Only possibility left is from current investors, but they already lost too much money. You need extremely good news to get more money out of your pockets.

I earn 12k a month now, so it isn't a very big problem (I invested 50k in february). But it still is a considerable amount of money to lose 35k, also considering the fact that i earn 12k a month only since august and before that it was 6k a month. Only positive btc and crypto brought me was i invested more time in my company to go from 6k to 12k, since I saw the money invested in crypto being evaporated and didn't like losing so much money. This last drop drives me to compensate the loss with my company even more. I expect to earn appr. 20k a month in a couple of months, but this is never a sure thing with business. Still stressed because of losing 35k. But there are more important things to me than only money. Still, I don't like it at all to lose so much money. I guess i'm a good businessman but a very bad investor, whatever that means. On the other hand, one thing I learned in life is: it's all about luck. There are people in worse circunstamces than me, so I understand them completely when they are angry or stressed.

You are right that it will recover but it's probably going to take a long time before reaching ath again. This drop was exceptional in that it didn't follow the market sentiment.

We'll see. You're right that Mt Gox played a big role. But i think it's easier to go from let's say 1000 to 20.000, than from 6.000 to let's say 30.000. I hope i'm wrong. I mean, if this price stability lasts long enough, people will realize the bottom was reached. But there must be reasons to invest: macro economic reasons, technological reasons, adoption, etc. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 20:42:35
Yeah, that's why everyone here was throwing their money in shitcoins and btc in february/march/april, huh? Only to realize we were in a bearmarket in AUGUST.

Using the word bearmarket was enough to be banned on this board, until end of july - probably the moment the mod realized we were in a bearmarket. People streaming FUD! all the time. Very Annoying.
Now you deal with cynical people when you say you should invest now, with low volatility and low volume. I learned from my own mistakes in the past: never follow the mass when it comes to investing. The majority is always full of shit and wrong.

I miscalculated the potential price. It is 4400, based on the interest level of 11 out of 100, last year in the first week of october. So, now the interest level went from 8 to 12 in 2 weeks. Somewhere between 4000 and 6000 is the bottom, cause price follows interest. It looks like the interest level in btc is climbing, but it might be too soon to tell if these are new investors or current investors with a higher level of interest. So if it's climbing, price may go up to correspond with level of interest.

my explanation for the high volatility of crypto is that most investors are basement dwellers (combined with a couple of whales that abuse them) and overall have  lower levels of testosterone, which leads to higher level of anxiety in general. So they react in a hypersensitive way on everything that happens, a bit like women do.

And STILL nobody has answered this crucial question neither solved this fundemental problem: how in the hell could there be ANY adoption if crypto's volatility is so high. There is litterally ZERO adoption at this point (using crypto to buy stuff). This becomes more and more urgent as time passes by. More people are going to ask themselves: what's its use? You can have the greatest idea in the world, if it is of no use, it simply dissappears. The problem of utility wasn't so urgent in the past. Now it becomes a crucial factor, and each day that passes by without any adoption endangers every crypto, including btc. There is never any guarantee that something will go up again, especially when the hypeyears are over. It must be useful, or else, you shouldn't even want to have anything to do with something that isn't usefull.

We can conclude one thing now that we have thought more about crypto after the current crash: crypto doesn't work. It simply doesn't work with high volatility. Nobody's going to use something that risks losing its value in 1 day. It turned into an online casino now and nobody really knows what the hell they're investing in and if all these cryptos really have value. All cryptos had more than one year to prove value, but nothing is happening, nobody is adopting them. Most companies start to be useful after a couple of months. More than 10 years of crypto has brought nothing but gambling, manipulation, speculation and casino.

What do you mean with sales? I was lucky and found a niche hole in the market i'm currently in. Like I said, I lost alot with crypto, but also run out of money because I had to pay for some health issues. I also dealt with a competitor who was becoming more and more aggressive. So i felt stuck and had to do something. I needed to find a way to increase my revenue/ money. I thought about it a couple of months. At first i thought i had to hire more people (and accept lower revenue and even loss the first year) to hold my position in the market and then slowly build up the revenue. I hired one additional person. Then I met someone who did freelancework for the service i sell. He didn't perform his job well, so i wanted to stop hiring him. But he was persistent and he was easy with communication and was goal oriented. Basically a sales mentality. I gave him another order from another service the company gives to clients. He was better at this task and also was able to sell it for a high price to clients. Not only that, he gave one client an extra service which wasn't part of the normal service i give. This gave me an idea to give this same service to other clients. I doubled my revenues and salary with this since september. It was a hole in the market. But there are always dangers, so i'm cautious.

What worries me most is that not a single cryptocurrency has been valuable/adopted by society, except for maybe Monero. And don't come up with Ethereum, that is an inner circle crypto. This is completely different compared to companies during the .com bubble. Microsoft was already useful and established for example. But not a single crypto has value in society nor is it being used by the mass. You can call that a huge failure.
@_date: 2018-11-15 08:41:42
Nice try. The difference is: previous bullrun didn't need average joe. Price from 7000 to 20.000 = average joe investor. What we know from average joe is that he's a one time investor. He gets in, burns his ass, and gets out. It was the same during .com bubble. He won't come back. That's why it took 16 years for Microsoft to get back at ath. The january crash of crypto IS the .com bubble for crypto. Once average joe is in the game, crash happens and it takes a long long time before intrinsic value of an asset matches the speculative value during hype/bubble. In fact, average joe is always the one who fucks everything up. It's all about intrinsic value now, that means adoption. It's going to take a long, very long time before adoption rate slowly goes up and crypto and blockchain start to get real value in society. Much longer than previous bearmarket. One thing is for sure: the speculative days are over. Don't expect new investors in the coming years. In 5 or 6 years, btc might have a value of 100.000. Until then, nothing is to be expected.

You are right. But every time you're trying to be realistic, you get a shitton of angry people on this board. The bearrun will take a long long time. First recession, then recovery, then you need a level of adoption, you need new money, governments adopting blockchain, etc. It's going to take 3 to 6 years in total, providing there is a certain level of adoption.

Suppose there is 500 people holding btc at the price of 6000. Now, let's assume 250 new investors want to step in (new interest). Do you think the price will go up or stay at 6000? Now, let's assume 250 people want to step out. What do you think will happen with the price? Right, it will fall. Current situation: flat interest line, which means the amount of btc holders stays approximately the same over a longer period of time, which means interest level is stable. No matter what happens, the price won't fall below a certain level that corresponds with amount of investors that are interested in btc, unless a nuclear war or something like that breaks out. I hope people finally understand this simple fact. You can moan all you want and dismiss what i say, the price will bounce back to natural price level

Volatility of bitcoin hasn't been so low since the start of bitcoin according to reports. As there is no interest in bitcoin, nor from average joe, nor from institutions, and price follows interest, sideways movement will continue. The nerds/bitcoin fanatics/miners don't want to let go of their bitcoin, so it's not likely it will drop below 5500-6000.

Things will probably go down untill the amount invested in cryptocompanies matches their true value: 60-70k. Enough to hire a PHP encoder and a secretary and continue business in an old garage or in the basement. These companies have ZERO value. I could start a company tomorrow that has more value than 90 percent of the top 500 coins. They have an app. So what? Everyone can make an app. There are millions of apps. Nobody uses these damn apps. You take a look at MC's of some cryptocompanies, you see 40,50,60 million. Are you fucking kidding me? I own a small business and my company is worth more than all of them combined, and i'm talking real value. The empty air must go, alot of empty air. MC's of 80 million of companies that don't even have a product or service? Give me a fucking break. It's based on air. These owners must laugh the shit out of their pants, having parties everywhere: Las Vegas, Hollywood, New York, Paris. Why would they give a shit about their own company, putting time and energy in something that has 0.1 percent chance to succeed.

Because price follows interest and interest is flat for months now, and that's why the price doesn't move. "But but that's not true, you're full of shit". O yeah? That's why i predicted the price to fall back between 6200-6400 when everyone was screaming moon two weeks ago and when everyone said it's going to fall back to 5000 6 weeks ago. Remember this: PRICE FOLLOWS INTEREST. And stop posting about Venezuelan people investing in btc. They got in in juli/august and already pulled out according to the interest charts. As if Venezuela is going to save us anyway. All their Pesos can't buy one btc.

6k was the real bottom though, if it was a normal market. But when you deal with forks and schifting massive amounts of money to forks, then it's a different ballgame. This is absolutely not a normal market pattern, cause if it was, it would have stabilized around 6000, or maybe slowly went down or up in the course of months, like it does on other markets when there's a crash. This is manipulation of the market.

What really is a shame is so many people invested their money in these useless companies. They have no value. I mean litterally zero value. Would there be ANY investor in the world that would pay money to buy - let's say - Reddcoin? I wouldn't even buy it if people payed me for it. If nobody would pay to buy for a company, it has ZERO value. Why haven't we seen big companies buying cryptocompanies? Because they have zero value. Where is Google, Facebook? Why don't they invest in cryptocompanies? None of these companies has value.

It's different now that there was massive exposure in december. To reach 20k you need massive exposure, a hype that has never been seen in human history. So at 20k you really exhausted maximum exposure. Yeah, and then there is the option of institutional money but of course institutions are not going to gamble with people's money so that is excluded. Conclusion: 5 to 10 years before hitting 20k again.

You're wrong. I earn more with my own company than any small/short bullrun of crypto ever could give me. I always take the worst case scenario, this has proven to be very helpful for me, cause it makes me think in problems, that's why i see almost every potential problem with my own business.
I haven't been succesful with investing in crypto though, and it seems that admitting this, is a problem for many people. As if gambling takes somekind of skill. It's mostly luck or patience.
Your reasoning is the same reasoning as what has been said at the beginning of the year by many people. Back then, I said the same thing: bullrun is not going to happen this year, and everything got angry. I say the same thing about 2019. It's not going to happen. Everything you say is a small drop on a burning plate. It's not about making it easy for investors. There is simply no (additional) demand for it. This is logical after a huge crash/.com cryptobubble. The hype is gone, people ask themselves: what is the true value of btc, and the value of blockchain in society, mass euphoria is gone. It has been labeled a hype by society, so you can put a cross on it, until the technology proves its value. But stating simple facts is enough reason for people here to get angry and even threatening to kill you. 
I agree with your last statement though. The only thing i say - the only thing i guess - is that it's going to take a long time. If i didn't think the value would go up i wouldn't have invested in it, and i have invested alot.

No lol. Wishfull thinking. It's going to take a very long time. The hype has passed. Going to take slow adoption, technological adaptation, slow acceptance of crypto and blockchain in society before it could reach 20 k again (which is peak exposure). Also, macro economic factors like inflation, recession etc. will play a role and the psychological recoverytime after a huge crash is long. 4-5 years before climbing would be positive, but i wouldn't be surprised if it takes longer. There's more room to drop the coming years, even to 1000 or lower. Exposure is extremely low, public interest declining. It is clear that there is huge overinflation of crypto prices. It doesn't correspondent with their actual utility. Alot of coins will dissappear, most of them will drop in value close to zero. The prices are based on hype for 99%.

I don't think you can compare the price and last crash with previous years. Things have changed, everyone knows Bitcoin now. 4% of western world investing in btc is a huge amount. People also underestimate the amount of publicity, hype, talk and exposure that is needed to get btc back at 20k. I mean it's enormous. The whole of society was bombarded with news about btc in december, adds flying over people's heads every day. It's going to take years to get these people back into btc, cause it won't happen with a new hype but with slow adoption. Hypes only happen once, never twice. There is no example in history where hypes happen twice. And with hypes, I don't mean the bullrun of 2013, but hypes in society. That being said, I do think that btc can reach 100k one day, but it's going to take a very long time.

Source? Haven't you seen how much hype it caused in december? It was all over the news, all over the net, all over Facebook. People believed in something special. To attract that amount of investors, bitcoin needs to be useful. For example, if fiat money depreciates in value, there might be a reason for people to invest in it. But now that the hype is over, and people start seeing Bitcoin's true value at the moment, there's absolutely no reason to invest, that's why it's declining all the time. You need major economic shock for people to move their money into crypto. It might happen some day in the future, but it could take a very very long time. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:41:50
Your example is wrong. AI is by far not sophisticated enough to solve these problems (but it is already used on a very small scale in western countries). Crypto actually already possesses the technology to be able to solve a couple of these problems. It's better to compare it with virtual reality. In the 90s, lots of people talked about it, but it took like 20 years before the consumer began to use it, especially now in the gaming industry.

Big crash after all time high of 20k was in january. This crash was caused by two forks a couple of days ago. Some people moved their money from btc into new forks and others just took their money out of btc and converted it into fiat, afraid of losing it. This caused a psychological blow. People losing confidence in btc and not re-investing their money, so the price didn't bounce back. Also, what you see now are miners selling part of their bitcoin in order to survive.

Yes, it would be completely irrational and dumb. Honesty and integrity should be completely illiminated from an investor's mental headspace. The only thing that counts in business is demand. If there is demand for Fool's gold, then people have spoken, and one should accept it as a reality. You are not ought to be a moral judge when it comes to marketlaws. You should be there were there's demand. Besides, who are you to judge morality? The same thing could be said about btc: it is fake money, no real value, prone to manipulation, etc. Just to say: everyone's perspective on what is moral and honest is different. You are not an investor but a fool.

Firstly, external macro economic factors: banking crisis of 2018 lead to blockchain and btc. It also lead to innovation in many countries and governments to cut costs and make profits. There will be a moment this economic growth reaches it's top and it's already slowing down. The next crisis could lead to new ways for governments and companies to implement cost effective methods. Blockchain is the solution. Blockchain makes the whole economic system and governmental system way more effective. So, it's about adoption now. With gradual adoption of blockchain, crypto will become more popular and mainstream. This will take some time. There could also be a currency problem like in Turkey (unlikely to happen in western countries) or an inflation problem (which already is happening in western countries, prices are going up). That's another reason to invest in crypto, cause investors always look for ways to maximize their gains (they had no big reasons to invest in cryoto with stocks reaching ath this year). The mass also looks for ways to secure its wealth.
Secondly, you deal with the psychology of the market. Don't underestimate the crash in january. It scared the hell out of people, especially average joe. It takes time before people get adjusted to the idea that Bitcoin and crypto are here to stay and are not going away. The last bearrun took 1.5 year. This crash was bigger, involving more people. It needs more time to recover.  You look at past marketpatterns, you see a huge crash in the first few weeks, then more dropping, and then a long sideway movement with low volume and low volatiliy. This is the period to invest for smart investors. 
So now the .com bubble for crypto has happened (once the mass touches an asset, the bubble bursts). Average joe = 'quickly in, quickly out an never return'. That's the reason why for example Microsoft needed 16 years to go back to Ath. The stock was touched by average joe, and new money didn't came in for years. Same situation with btc. Every nerd and cryptofanatic is already involved. It's going to take years before slowly attracting new investors and new money. 
There are other factors. Institutional money will not come in. I already said that in february here and everyone was angry and said institutional money will come 100% in 2018, and i was banned for saying the opposite. Institutions are NOT interested in highly volatility markets. They are looking for long term gains (10-20-30 years) with reasonable growth and medium risks. They are not interested in quick gains. They don't care if btc could reach 12000 next week. Big institutions are gambling with people's money, they will not invest in crypto unless volatility is stable. It's out of the question. 
But i am convinced btc will reach 100.000 within a couple of years, cause society needs blockchain and btc is the symbol of this new system. I'm sure people who invest now will have made x 10 in 3 to 6 years. This is THE period to invest. Volatility is gone, flat Line, volume is low. What do you want more as an investor? What are people waiting for? Ah, of course, they are waiting to invest when price drops or goes up, the most stupid moments to invest. You need to invest when volatility is low, volume is low. 
Besides, even in bearmarkets there are ups and downs. You look at the bearmarket of 2013-2015, you'll see some small bullruns. I would say, take advantage of it and be lucky.
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:07:06
For some it won't, for others it will. It only takes some to sell to make it drop lower. Besides that, it's going to take at least 5 years before it goes up again. Most people don't have that patience.
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:24:11
I don't know what you're trying to say. In order for prices to go up, something must have value, produce value or be used. Not a single crypto is used by the mass. No cryptocompany has intrinsic value. Alarmbells should rinkle, owners of cryptocompanies should stop giving parties all the goddamn time and start WORKING. I see pictures of parties on Telegram groups all the time. All talk, no action. These people must be attacked, but we're dealing with zombies/cult members, not investors. Every time you hear a critical opinion, it's being shut down. Why are these companies not working and partying all the time? They need to WORK. They took the money and now they're talking and partying and posting pics on Telegramgroups. It's not a fucking Instagram contest. In case you wonder what this has to do with btc: adoption of crypto and blockchain in society is good for btc. But there is no pressure on these companies by investors aka fools aka cultmembers, throwing their money away instead of putting pressure on these companies to start deliver something. Nobody's working, it's the .com bubble all over again. They took the money and went partying.

Yes, here is an example of an article about it. 
Soon after this announcement, all crypto went up and continued to go up cause holders and traders kept putting their money in crypto. People thought middle eastern oil money would poor in. Looking back, maybe a little bit more middle eastern money came in from some private investors, but certainly no huge amounts of oil money, otherwise we would have seen massive price rise. 
It was a period when investors were emotional/sensitive: very scared of bad news and hyper with good news. Every good news caused price rise, every bad news caused a price drop. So, there was huge overreaction. I'm pretty sure, if this announcement was made now, almost nobody would care alot, cause investors are more cynical at the moment. Also, less scared and at the same time less hopeful.

Despite the media telling you otherwise, there is NO institutional money flowing in, and there is no interest from the public. The spike towards 8400 was caused by hype of eft, no new money from new investors. Alts are dying, btc goes to 5500 in november, before going back to 9000 in december. In 2019 it will go back to 7000, before a new bullrun begins end of 2019/beginning of 2020. It will be a 25 month bear market, which was expected. Almost all alts will die (98 percent).

You are right. Good explanation. Still, I do think that it can reach 20k one day again. Btc is here to stay, but it might take 5-10 years to reach that value.

7900, low volume, not alot of positivism after eft disapproval, no renewed interest from the public, have seen that before. Harsh times in the coming months. Only thing that keeps price at 7900 at the moment is speculation on etf of 16 august.

Trust in bitcoin has reached its highest level in history. Institutions are beginning to see it as something sustainable and not a bubble. This is a markingpoint for crypto.

So much nonense from these crypto media. The btc rise was sparked by eft news.

Not a single cryptocompany is adopted or makes money. If you put any of those ones for sale, nobody would buy it, which means they are worth zero. They're loaded with cash and throwing parties in Las vegas/los angeles/new york/qatar/london/paris, but deliver nothing, meanwhile nobody wants to buy their failed apps. I wouldn't spend a single shekel on them. They need a roadmap of 1,5 years to launch a company and build an app? Are you kidding me? Give me 500 dollars and i'll start a company tomorrow. People put 800 million in cheap ass companies that sell empty air? 3 billion in dodgecoin? fcking lmao. How about these people are completely delusional. You'd hardly find a company on planet earth worth more than a billion. At least dotcom companies made money DURING the crash. They delivered. Cryptocompanies are a complete utter failure at the moment and people start to realize that. And can we please stop with those sob stories about Venezuela? These people don't need bitcoin, they need to start working and build up their country. For god sake, you don't even need an education in 2018, just read internet, all information is available, all scientific information, everything. Stop being lazy and start making money. So, there is this intelligent guy with good education from Venezuela on this board. Instead of using his skill and education to enter the world online boundless market, either with a company or as a freelancer - and start making money - people tell him to put all his money in crypto and treat him like an eternal victim with no skills and brains. Worst advice ever given, wasted 5 years of his life, could have been rich by making right decisions - no education needed.

The most important post ever written on this board:
 
I have been studying the Google trends chart. This log chart is particularly helpful as this is the only way to see the whole picture instead of one huge spike.
Now as I have often mentioned earlier, one has to be very careful interpreting the relationship between price and search trends because they feed on each other. That said, one uncanny takeaway I see is that the price at various bear market bottoms for Bitcoin has been proportional to the square of the search index prevailing at that time. Search index on the link above is defined as the search multiple from 1/1/2012.
So if you look at the boring lows of 2012, mid 2013, mid 2015 and even late 2016, you will see that price has been very closely proportional to the square of the search index during those periods. But the relationship very quickly breaks down during any period of hype or over bullishness.
My theory is that this is because at the boring lows, Google trends are indeed a good indicator of how many people are genuinely interested in learning about bitcoin whereas during hype periods, the search index gets contaminated by speculators who are searching bitcoin only because they hear of rising price.
So now that we are at a boring low, I see a search index of roughly 25 whereas in Oct 2016, it was around 9. So this shows a support for a price of around 700 times (25/9)2 = 5400.
Ofcourse this is assuming that search interest has stabilised and not still contaminated by speculators but I think that's a fair assumption especially after the very dull and low volume markets in October.

'Most people I know'. Lol. Everyone always knows the good people: the ones that work 80 hours a week, the ones that got rich, the ones that deversified their portfolio, the ones that got out on time, the ones that bought the dip, the rational ones, the smart daytraders who always make money, the ones that could afford to lose it, the ones that only lost 10 percent during the crash. Nobody knows the majority: NEETS, cucks and REKKT people with miserable lives that lost 90 percent of their portfolio + the 2% that already jumped off the golden gate bridge and a bunch of others with low testosterone and high anxiety levels causing huge volatility like a woman during her period.

Yeah 'very easy', i'd rather be a bit realistic after a disastrous year and the .com/cryptobubble, and absolute no positive signs for the coming 6 months.

Trendindicator signals we're passed the bottom. Bottom would have been something like 5500 if the forks didn't happen. Now, maybe we can slowly go down to 3000, but nobody fucks with statistics/Google search results, the only valuable data about bitcoin. We can go sideways a couple of years, but either way, these are the moments to buy.  I rely on my analysis that public interest = THE indicator that should decide when to invest. I will come out as a winner and prove I'm right. I don't give a shit about other people's analysis.

Everyone that put all his cards on crypto deserves to get Rekkt. This is usually a sign of lazyness and lack of productivity. Time to get out of bed and do something productive for society. Fortunately, lazy people usually don't get rich, so there is some justice in this world.

Banks are going to adopt crypto themselves. Why? Because there is a huge market of people that would want to invest in crypto but don't know much about it, don't want to spend time on it, are afraid of losing their keys, afraid of being hacked, afraid of not able to control their emotions, etc. They will gladly hand over their money to banks like they do with stocks, to let other people invest for them. Banks are completely stupid if they don't take advantage of this potential market. This is what's going to happen within 3 to 5 years, when most of the milennium generation will enter the labor market and won't be so scared of new ways to invest like the older generation. They will be accustomed to crypto. So no, banks will not go away, neither will crypto. The biggest enemy of crypto will adopt it themselves and secure their existence by doing so.

\+ instinct. Use your (business) instincts. I can't believe there are poor people on this planet, in this time and age of internet. So much opportunities to earn money on the net, with all kind of things. All knowledge is available on the net, you don't even have to go to school.

The most delusional people in crypto are the ones that keep telling us 'institutional money is coming soon'. They get angry when you say crypto is an investment for basement dwellers with low testosterone and high anxiety levels (hence the volatility), mixed with a couple of smart whales and daytraders who rob them off their money every now and then.

I hope that everyone understands that the moment average joe steps in, the game changes. The level of hype in 2017 was EXTREME. It means the hype value of the asset is way, way higher than its actual value. ALL markets work the same, there is no exception, cause human psychology and emotion is always the same.  The ONLY bullrun that counts is the bullrun leading to average joe stepping in, the only real bearrun is this bearrun. I don't care what people say about previous bearruns and bullruns. They don't count anymore. So if you had the patience to hold between 2013 and 2015, you will need to have three times as much patience now.  The price of btc will only exceed the ath of december 2017 if, and only if, the coin proves to be valuable (that means adoption, that means blockchain being implenented all over countries and companies, that means people using it to buy stuff). This can take a very very long time, but trust me when I say btc will never reach ath again only based on hype. It has to prove its value, otherwise it's game over.

Easily means MASSIVE hype to reach 10k. I don't know where you get that easy from after 1 year bearmarket and declining public interest. It can take a long long time, especially because no institutional money + continuous declining of public interest. 2019 will be another bearyear so that will be 2 years of bearmarket.

See, this is why people don't take crypto investors seriously. This has nothing to do with investment (aka looking at things clearly and draw realistic conclusions based on the market, that could be negative or positive conclusions for crypto). You say this to a stockmarket investor and he will laugh his ass off. There is no negative or positive, there is a market that could go up or down.

Nobody precisely know what he/she invested in. Nobody precisely knows what the hell it is and what you could do with it except speculate and gamble like in Las Vegas. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 03:03:07


Something becomes a payment system from the moment it is used as a payment system to actually PAY for things. From day one, btc was a mean to speculate, like a slot machine in Las Vegas, and now, after 10 years it still has the same function. When I make a car, it doesn't become an airplane after 10 years, just like that. This is not a bearmarket, this is an EXISTENTIAL problem. One could say:  what's wrong with it being a speculative asset? Thing is, that idea only can last some time, because it doesn't have an underlying value. Then people will say: but its value is that you can transfer money within a trustless system. Yes, that's only a real value IF it's a payment system and is used to pay things. You see the flawed logic? Crypto has a fundemental problem, something the .com companies didn't have after the crash.

I believe that not much will happen with crypto when there is a financial crisis. Also, you just don't want a financial crisis. The last one caused alot of friction and problems in western societies, all over the world: ISIS, terrorism, hate, unemployment, anxiety, political crisis, insecurity, angry people, etc. It diminishes the quality of life. People want to have peace on their mind. 
It also depends on what sort of crisis. If it's inflation or a currencyproblem like in Venezulea and Turkey (highly unlikely in western world), crypto might benefit. If it's rising unemployment, people will have less money to spend. If it's a banking crisis again (highly unlikely so soon after the previous one), crypto might benefit directly. If it's plummeting stockmarkets, people will look at safe ways like gold and silver.  There will of course be a new crisis, but you better not hope for it.
