I wouldn't be surprised if we learn in the future that we find some power companies have been quietly mining bitcoin for years.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:39:35
Unfortunately, they will also be mining BCash. The article from the local paper includes a short highlight about the enterprise in which a representative from the company talks about BCash being on the agenda.

Their status page is a big mess at the moment. Those transaction delays might be helped if they integrated SegWit, at least then they could remove an item from the list of broken stuff they are currently displaying.
People are going to be mad about the BTC market being unavailable. BTC is on a nice moderate bull run right now. Coinbase fucking things up.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:46:05
That is actually a good question because it gets really hot and humid here in the summer. For about 4-5 months of the year, the cost of cooling that building is going to high. Of course, we also have an ice skating rink in town that operates year round so if they can find a way to make that work, I suppose a bitcoin mine can work too!

It might even be that the coffee shop ends up having an internal channel just for themselves. For example, customers interact with a set channel to make payments, but the company has two nodes. One node is for customer payments, which can remain open indefinitely, but the channel to the other node is managed by the company accountant which siphons off money from one node to be sent deeper into the company to another node for payments and cost distribution. Since channels are like accounts, it would make sense for the company to have different channels/accounts for different purposes.
Just because a channel exists for us to pay for our coffee, doesn't mean that the company doesn't have other channels which are intended to collect and collate those funds for other purposes. It's a network, so the network can be leveraged to do that kind of thing. As it grows, we will get to see rather creative use cases like this for moving money into and within an organization.

That's my town! The local paper has reported that this is going to be the largest mining operation in North America. I don't know how true that is, electricity isn't cheap here. However, the city is the landing point of a new trans-atlantic internet cable. Because of that, the city is more willing to invest in tech companies. There is a desire in council to turn this town into a data center hub.

Stellar is fine, for what it is, however it is notably different than Bitcoin - to the point of being almost apples to oranges comparison. Stellar is a great project, with some great people behind it, but it is not decentralized. That one fact alone is very important to consider.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:17:42
Except that, in time, you won't need to. LN uses intelligent pathfinding through multiple hops to get your payment to the shop. This happens within seconds. It is a very elegant concept.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:23:53
I actually like the stellar project and there are some good things going on with it. However, it is no where near enough to being decentralized enough to be a Bitcoin replacement (which some people are hoping for). Stellar may prove to be a great project but at the end of the day it is entirely dependant on the benevolent dictators who operate and control issuance of the coins. Yes, that method works for open source software, but not so much for currency (see The Fed).

@_date: 2018-01-10 18:22:24
No, the channels stay open and store the records of the transactions that run through them. When the channel is closed, by either party, the money in the channel is distributed to its owners and that transaction is stored on the blockchain.
The blockchain does the heavy lifting while the channel holds a pile of little transactions before writing the final tally to the blockchain when the channel is closed.

@_date: 2017-12-20 18:24:35
Correct, but because it has been locked it has the same effect as new money. The interesting part is that this is a better example of how new money effects things than a hard fork because now we have two existing currencies with viable markets (at least in this example) and one of them is getting a massive increase in its circulating supply while the other is not. I think this makes it more interesting to watch than a hard fork as a hard fork you get two currencies but only 1 has a viable market at the time.

They are specifically targeting commercial payment processing. This is a different subset of transaction space other than what bitcoin will do. They are building the infrastructure for merchants to accept dash easily with a simply embed code along with all the account and transaction management that businesses need for accounting.
LN will make bitcoin fantastic, but business transaction and accounting services for bitcoin are not being addressed. It is up to the business owners to do the accounting. Dash is, admittedly, more centralized with a very specific target in mind. This focus is a positive, because they are intentionally working to supplant the existing commercial payments industry for businesses with a more complete infrastructure.

No, the coins pending at GDAX and Coinbase are *not* in circulation. (okay, they exist on the books, but they've been locked up since they were created). All of this is new money to the economy and it is going to drop very, very fast. I'm thinking below $1,000 before the buyers make it in to supports. Savvy buyers who value BCH will wait as long as they can before buying, they will be perfectly fine with it dropping to $500 before triggering support.
How much and how fast it recovers from the release of this money remains to be seen, but because of the large amount of money being *created* into the economy today, you will need a pump to get back to the current price.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:19:34

I think bitcoin shook out all the profit takers on the bull run the other day. If we are lucky, this push is backed by a lot of natural buying
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:54:41
This is what I was thinking. It occurred to me that that big bull run in the days just before the futures market opened (the one that took us close to 19k) was just those institutions buying up enough coin so that they can turn around and keep the price suppressed. 
I was thinking that run was the big investor money being used to build a strong enough position to keep the price under control for the future calls.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:39:45
Remember, there is a massive supply of new bcash coins entering the market in a few hours. This is massively going to depress the bcash price (overwhelming supply lowers prices). This is a massive inflation event of new money being printed that didn't exist before.
Expect to see a major fall in bcash price coupled with a major spike in BTC price. Over coming days they will correct.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:36:36
With the starting price of BCH being $4300 when they hit the trigger, the initial fall is going to be massive. I wouldn't be surprised if BCH goes as a low as $500 in the first hours.

Yeah, I saw that, but it isn't actually working yet. When I checked in the site, the addresses are not segwit addresses. They even have a button to generate new addresses on demand, but when I clicked it, the address it generated didn't start with a 3, which is what segwit addresses begin with.
They might have it ready, but as far as I can tell, it isn't actually deployed yet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:34:20
I think technical analysis doesn't work in this situation because we are being presented with a market event that technical analysis can't account for (since it can only account for past patterns). Even if you think that technical analysis is a good predictor as the market subtly adjusts and prepare for moves, I think today's event and the amount of new money coming in that never existed in the economy before is make technical analysis methods invalid.
While I love telling people that they are right because it just a nice thing to do, sadly, I think today will be a day you might be wrong (and I say that in the nicest possible way!)
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:05:28
BTC is not going to drop. BCH is going to drop because of newly printed money entering the economy today. Bitcoin is a good you can buy with BCH, with a known supply that is not changing today, therefore price of BTC is going up this afternoon, and BCH is going down.
This is an *inflationary* event, we are witnesses a small digital version of the Venezuelan money printing that ruined the Venezuelan Bolivar.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:33:04

It may be temporary, but we are going to the moon for a vacation. It is going to happen because the amount of bitcoin in circulation is going to remain the same. Meanwhile, the amount of bcash in circulation is going way up. You are going to witness what happens when massive amounts of money get injected into an economy. The value of that money massively decreases and the values of the goods surrounding that money increases. Today, Bitcoin is one of the goods surrounding the money being printed.
Economics 101 proves that Bcash is going to crash and remain depressed for maybe a couple days, while other things you can buy with Bcash (Bitcoin, for example) are going to become more expensive.

The increase is just people buying, could be a pump or just market activity. Without all the garbage surrounding bcash, it actually has some good tech fundamentals (in the short term, but not for massive scaling) so it has value it in a way it is worth buying (if you can look past the bullshit surrounding it).

Sent this in to support. They may never read it, but if many people contact them, maybe some of the message will get through.
*I know you guys are really busy, and I appreciate all the hard work you have done recently in keeping Coinbase and GDAX online. Thank you for all you have done for the bitcoin community!*
*I'm writing to throw my support around getting Segwit support added to Coinbase and GADX. As a technology company, I would argue that it is important for you to keep pace with the technology of bitcoin as it evolves. I think users want this to be able to take advantage of lower fees and faster transactions. I know I do and I'm probably not alone.*
*Coinbase is a market leader and I'd love to see that you are using that position to stay on the cutting edge of bitcoin.*
*Will you be publishing a timeline or roadmap to firm up when segwit support will be added?*

I use Samouri as the go to wallet to introduce people. I get them to download and then I send them $10 from the stash I have in my own wallet. The conversion is easy and Samourai has been a good tool for introducing Bitcoin use to new users. 
Removing the fiat option now, I think, is a bit premature by a few years. It needs to come, but we aren't there yet. Now I have to switch to a different tool to acclimatize new users to Bitcoin.

It looks like transaction fees have doubled in the past two days. In December alone they have gone from a reasonable $5 average, to now, nearly $40.
Source: 
I do actually see this as a problem. That is a significant increase happening very quickly, and looking back historically of the charts, it is fastest spike in fees BTC has ever had and the highest fee. Given the trend, it may actually go higher in the coming days. We might actually see a $100 transaction fee average by New Years.
is going to be on Bloomberg later and I'm hoping she is able to give a realistic timeframe for relief of this. 
Looking at the spike on the chart, I am actually a little concerned.
Usual caveats: I strongly dislike bcash, and am hodling BTC. Since I'm hodling, I'm not hugely concerned about the transactions fees, but I am concerned about their impact on the value of BTC (after all, I am a grumpy hodler).

This video actually does a terrible job describing, but this Reddit thread has done a fantastic job of describing it.
**Thank you to the great members here who have been patiently explaining the Lightning Network!**
I've actually read through the whole thread and learned alot. One of the things I've found interesting the role of the hubs. I'm assuming that these are just well-connected major nodes. As I see it, lightning nodes offer banks an opportunity to be part of the bitcoin network.  While it is democratic in as long as the nodes can be powered by home-class computers, I admit that I actually like the possibility that banking institutions can also work to setup larger hub nodes.
I know that among bitcoiners, anti-bank is a thing, but this gives banks a chance to get on board without being a bunch of assholes about it, while further driving adoption.
Overall though, after reading this thread, I'm finding that the lightning network is as a magnificent piece of technology as bitcoin itself. Thanks to all who have kindly answered questions and described it so well!
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:48:14
The source is here, you can view it first hand on the BTC/USD and BTC/BCH charts.
The function of large supply depressing price is basic economics. Think of bananas, if banana producers have a good production year, the market gets flooded with bananas and farmers can compete on price driving the price down. Bananas get cheaper for everybody.  Price goes too low, farmers start grinding their crop into the ground with dozers to reduce the supply.
This is newly printed money in the form of bcash entering the market for the first time ever. Today, supply of circulating bitcoin remains the same, but the supply of circulating bcash increases by many thousands of coins.
On the markets today, you are going to see the digital version of the money printing and inflationary disaster that happened in Venezuala.
(keep in mind this price depression won't last and bcash will correct upward in the next week - at a price closer to where its fundamentals put it.)
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:50:06
I think Dash has a longer lifespan even in the presence of lightning. They are specifically working on a branded approach using the blockchain to compete with PayPal. I do think they will gain a foothold there on the commercial side of things. Dash will never overtake Bitcoin, but they very well may hold their own. Big software release on track to deploy next spring and their roadmap is set for the next several years.
The self funding is helpful. They are currently working with a 10 million dollar monthly budget. Bitcoin will be a solid general use coin, but dash is intentionally targeting a very specific market and may very find success there as a solid alternative.

Stop sells are protection mechanisms meant to get you out of your position when the price moves against you. If the market falls too fast when the stop is triggered, you will get the price you get and it may be lower than what you expected.

Bitcoin isn't going down today, it is going up. The influx of new money (bcash) into the economy is going to crash the value of bcash today and raise the value of Bitcoin (where the supply of money is remaining the same).
If you like trading, buy bitcoin right now to build your position and sell in several hours.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:47:45
Given the amount of downward pressure on BCH and the massive increase in monetary supply occurring in BCH today, I'm predicting we are going to see one of the largest intra-day increases in BTC in history. Within hours, we might hit 20k and maybe go higher.
It will correct, but I hope your moon buggy has gas because we are going to be visiting today at least for a little while.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:05:43
Dash is intentionally going after PayPal as a payment processor. They want to use the blockchain to bring trustless payments to consumers. Given their roadmap and their funding (part of the mining reward goes to the treasury to fund development), I think they have a high chance of success.
If someone told you about PayPal 15 years ago and told you to invest, would you? I'm telling you about Dash right now and I firmly believe they have a chance to take down PayPal.
Their end goal is actually to make it easy enough for grandma to use. They've actually adopted that as their slogan, but it also serves the developers and designers as the horizon for development.
They will not replace bitcoin, but they will become a major player in the online payments industry tackling Stripe, PayPal and Venmo in the process.

Sort of, but it really is only speculating at the level of a high school student in the first week of an economics class. This is one of the basic rules of economics and monetary policy. It isn't even a matter of confidence in the idea, I can actually make the gaurantee that this afternoon Bcash is going to crash alot, before it is picked up and supported and that Bitcoin is going to rise by several thousand dollars.
The effect may last hours or days, but expect cool drama.

If you like trading, start buying bitcoin for your trade right now (as in immediately after reading this message). The value of bitcoin is going to increase by a few (maybe several) thousand dollars.
The increase in bitcoin today will be exponentially higher than the decrease in bcash, but get you trading fingers ready. There is a lot of money to be made when GDAX flips the switch and turns on trading. You can already see the pressure building. This is going to be fun.

Agreed on the shady history, but they appear to have evolved. They basically demoted the founder (he volunteered) and hired a real CEO. Have done a lot of good business moves. In my view, they are one of the only currencies that balancing decentralization with centralization rather well, which is something a lot of consumers are comfortable with. They stand a real chance in finding success as a payment platform. 
I think Bitcoin will always be bigger and better, but dash will likely succeed in filling the niche they are targeting.

That is a really good article about the strong use of cash in Germany. I remember that from traveling there several times over the last couple of years. The values and theories which cash brings to a transaction (privacy, security, etc) are still values that appear to be important to Germans. The article talks about the elements of using cash that are important to us Bitcoiners that elements that Bitcoin has.
Bitcoin brings those things with it as well, especially as privacy models and transaction costs improve.  It has the convenience of digital money, but the effect and usefulness of cash. As Bitcoin continues to spread, I can Germans, with their privacy-minded thinking, being at the forefront of the Bitcoin movement. Americans are okay with the banks and government tracking us every time we buy bread and milk, Germans don't care for that crap. Seems like Germany would be a good, first-world proving ground for Bitcoin adoption as a daily currency.

I don't see a lot of sell offs happening. That last run to 20k happened so fast that there couldn't that much accumulation by people who want to sell it out. I suspect only a portion of those who bought at these levels will sell, and now with the increased demand we might eat through those sells.

Gave my 11yo and 13yo Bitcoin for Xmas. Paper wallet in a nice card. They thought it was pretty cool. They didn't ask for, but we're thrilled to have it.
11yo wanted to now if she could buy slime with it...

That was really fucking bizarre. Those two are crazy and amplifying each other's crazy. That whole interview was nutty.

He, himself, prefers to be called *Bitcoin Sherpa*. We are lucky to have such a great guide.

I wonder what his politics were like. He raised two knuckleheads... His son is a leading player in the UKs current crisis.

One of the main long time promoters is Venezuelan. I'm not sure if he is still in the country, but he actually was paid wages by Dash, via their governance system to promote it. He also runs one of the main info blogs and podcasts about it.
Even before the crisis, Dash already had healthy foothold in the country thanks to his efforts.

Just checked the price. Just think, people still don't get it.

Question about Bluewallet.
My understanding so far is that to load the lightning wallet, I first have to send Bitcoin to the segwit wallet on the app. Then, I have to use the app send the coin from the segwit wallet into the lightning wallet. Is that required, or can I just transmit coin straight from from my exchange wallet into the Lightning wallet?
Right now, it seems like a two-transaction process to load lightning. Am I doing it wrong?

God I love the Bitcoin markets. Somebody sneezes and it moves $300.
It's just fun.

Well, that's all we got folks, all going down now. Pack it up and go home.

Not gonna happen, just going to tease us for awhile.
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:37:24
Well, that was fun. Good weekend everybody, we should do it again like that more often!
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:36:23
Yup, and that suits me just fine.

I never tire of this video. I like to share it with skeptics and remind them that the Bitcoin that was worth 26 cents is the very same Bitcoin that now worth thousands.

Nice to think that I'm a veteran hodlr now from 2017. I've learned to have strong hands.
Bought but have never sold...
