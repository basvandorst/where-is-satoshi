Bitcoin on discount!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:46:26
We'll see
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:47:49
No. Bitcoin cash is just a bad fork. It's like the twin little brother that nobody likes. Pump and dump. Now is the time to buy BTC and HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:21:40
Coinbase shit the bed and fucked everyone whilst confirming what we all knew which was that they were cancer. I wish I could be more specific but I'm not an oncologist. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:07:26
In a word - yes. Grown ups use banks and stock exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:51:34
Radical man HODL to the moon
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:45:40
The recommendation is you don't use Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:57:29
Crypto currencies don't invade my community under the guise of "cultural tolerance" and "integration" then build mosques everywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:08:28
What the fuck are you on about. It's BUY 1 GET 1 FREE. 50% OFF EVERYTHING MUST GO DISCOUNT
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:54:31
It will go back up but one thing you need is time. This is what you get when you take financial and/or investment advice from random strangers on the internet. There's a stickied post that says "Don't invest recklessly". Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:48:19
Like any investment, you should talk about it with someone qualified.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:13:22
You're talking to a subreddit full of a wide variety of ages, some actually being literal babies.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:11:00
What other exchanges are there out of interest?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:23:28
I wonder how effective the SEC will be considering their jurisdiction and the global nature of crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:22
Coinbase shit the bed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:16:23
The end for you? Fine. I'm just getting started.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:25:52
Probably refresh the page and all that. Website issue.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:46:44
Nah I won't prove you wrong because you're right. Glad people are finally realising.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:06:09
Coinbase have always been and will continue to be shady cunts
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:54:37
You might have to go through some kind of verification process as well if not already done.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:53:28
Coinbase is cancer too. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:42:09
Here's an idea for anyone with a bot
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:06:37
Free lambos all the way bro get on them parabolic curves and surf it out
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:19:20
Coinbase are registered in the UK so probably someone there? "Coinbase services are provided by Coinbase UK, Ltd., a UK entity. Coinbase UK, Ltd. is not a regulated financial services provider and does not operate outside the UK."
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:18:00
I think you accidentally a word.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:32:17
Shitcoin from shitbase what a surprise
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:31:19
Not sure what actual authority BBB have over this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:18
The amount of BTC you get should be the same as the value you agreed to when purchasing but the value will change once it's in your wallet to reflect the current value.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:23:59
Give it a few days.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:25:54
You need to get them physically - i.e. get the computer he used, his email account, his phone if he has 2fa, his hardware wallet, etc. If they are on Coinbase you'll need the login information. You could attempt a legal route by contacting Coinbase support and providing a death certificate but I don't know how any of that would work out.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:22:39
Did you just assume that I like bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:38:19
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:41:14
They weren't thinking the employees were too busy buying BCH
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:04
No, you're retarded
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:34:54
Did we just watch the same thing? Discount bitcoin was flying off the shelf. HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:51:48
You haven't lost anything till you cash out. HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:50:54
Using Coinbase? I'm so sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:23:48
There's only 1 rule.
Rule 1) HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:29:20
10/10 for the music.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:57
There are no regulations. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:41:35
RIP all those people who bought on Coinbase for 8k.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:02:05
Thanks for your input
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:55:53
Yeah they are out there. Higher rates though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:15:11
You do 0.01137376 divided by 3
Maybe bitcoin isn't for you...
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:14:02
Coinbase is bullshit so yes?! Don't act so surprised. Oh you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:53:03
Doesn't centralization defeat the purpose of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:06:26
I can't see how a credit system with crypto would work but I was also exploring the idea - you bring up an interesting point about mortgages and loans though. The concentration of wealth wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing though would it - if families held on to their money it could be plausible.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:44:49
Mass sell and devaluation of BCH until it's irrelevant
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:56:50
What a world it would be if we were forced to live within our means.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:46:13
Oh I hope not. This isn't new they've always been doing this I suspect - hopefully this brings some light to Coinbase and people become more aware of the issue. The internet doesn't forget.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:38:45
Far out bro can't wait for the parabolic
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:16:39
The solution is you check and double check and be super careful. You are responsible for your own actions.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:24
Coinbase are doing something unethical? SHOCKER.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:16:18
You might be retarded
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:15:02
Its a fork of bitcoin - read the release CoinBase put out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:50:07
It's Bitcoins ugly brother that nobody wants.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:44:00
Probably not enough evidence to determine insider trading considering they released a press statement stating their intentions...
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:53:47
WHO KNEW THEY MANIPULATE THE DATA?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:12:09
I hear Coinbase to GDAX is a good way but double check I may be wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:31:39
Yeah true.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:03:04
Coinbase is just a big general huge mistake.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:49:10
You could contact the people you bought it from if you're seriously worried.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:08:58
Bitcoin Cash is the ugly rejected brother of Bitcoin (Fork) and it's really needing the coathanger from Mum.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:06:49
No. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:36
To withdraw you need to confirm your bank account by doing an international SEPA transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:10:12
Bitcoin just burst mate. You better sell it all before it's worth absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:52:13
7 more days than I gave it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:42:20
Also hate Coinbase that is all.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:30:46
Who knows. With their terms of service you're at their mercy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:45:04
Legal? This is the internet mate. There are no regulations. You can probably dispute this with your bank or try their customer support with the exchange.
