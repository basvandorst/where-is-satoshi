So close to breaking thru that $13.9, fuuuuuck
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:53:07
Its not the only reason. But I disagree that its a minor factor. 90% of the 324,000,000 US population celebrate Xmas. Let's just say 25% of that 90% invest in Bitcoin. And now lets say half of that 25% are hodling and the other half is cashing out for holidays. Roughly 37,000,000. Ok, knowing that and that the average amount of investments of bitcoin buyers is 0.1 per bitcoin. Roughly averaging $1000 lets say. Now times that by roughly 35,000,000. And you get a $35 billion drop essentially conrtibuting significantly to the 25% drop in the market cap. And this isn't even including other countries that may celebrate. I may be talking out my ass. But its something to think about.

And if they are smart investors, they'll see the upward trend that's happening right now.  But if you scare people here, and it starts to tilt off its pattern, it will just scare the Asians into selling.  We're in positive motion right now.  Anyone looking at candlesticks and a chart can see it.

" Remember guys, just zoom out!  This is nothing new!" 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:10:23
Gonna be seeing some drops. Support is at $12.7.

I feel like this is a battle between us and Roger Ver. Like fucking Mario and Bowser on Mario Party 64. Bowser is hoarding and manipulating all the coins. Bcash Bcash Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:42:37
Has anyone else noticed that almost every fucking coin is going down on CoinMarketCap?  How is this possible?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:07:59
Don't get scared everyone.  This is a bunch of people taking out for the holidays.  But when thats over, every damn investor, millennial and their mother is going to buy the dip and shoot it back up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:52:40
I like how the media can't keep up with the value.  Every time they put out some article, they're behind by like an hour.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:40:15
Personally, been on here a bit and can vouch for this guy.  It was mainly Panini and Leggos or whatever the fuck.
EDIT: May not agree with what you say, but it doesnt sound badly motivated, or trollish imo
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:07:45
Hodl on people. We got this. Rich people are buying the BTC dip and its gonna rise back up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:18:36
EVERYONE.  If this is a crazy short by the big boys, then just HODL ON.  They are trying to drive the price down, scare people, buy at the dip, drive it back up and then sell off.  Just riiiide the waves. Almost every coin is going down by at least 20%.  You can't tell me that millions of people are all invested in every single one of these coins, and are somehow selling off all at the same time within the last 4 hours. We are being played.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:29:59
If you go look at it on a chart like TradingView for example,  and create a trend line from its lowest point in the last 6 hours at $11k, to its most recent low ($12.6), you'll find that it is on an upward trend, and that its getting higher with each hump and not getting lower than the humps lows. If that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:14:56
Oh wow, it going up right now is a good sign. If it breaks 12.8, we've hit a new high and its sort of on an up trend
EDIT: nvmd, fml
EDIT 2: Oh wait...
EDIT 3: OH DAMN
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:42:18
If it can hit 13 within the next hour or so, we've broken a barrier. HODL (AKA let Coinbase just not let you do anything)
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:26:51
I know it says to avoid repetition on community guidelines, but I'm gonna keep saying it:
Everyone who is buying right now, you are GODDAMN HEROES !
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:00:16
Fuck off dude. You've been spreading fear on this sub for hours now. GTFO.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:59:05
Whoever you are that's buying.....I fucking love you
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:55:19
It all makes sense now.  I think that drop was due to the South Korean exchange getting hacked.  It was something like 50 or 60 billion got stolen and the drops we were seeing were the thefts selling off all those damn coins.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:08:18
Just a tip for any newcomers, ignore "fonestar". This guy is constantly trying to scare people off BTC. Just HOLD. HODL*
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:54:36
STOP PANIC SELLING.  YOU JUST CREATE MORE PANIC SELLING.  HODL longer and you'll get a better reward. We're on a fuckin up trend right now. SHhhhhHHHhHHHhh....
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:48:40
Dude nobody cares about BCH. Its just as useless as BTC. I'm just trying to make USD off this shit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:11:47
Technically, its sort of a good thing that Coinbase and GDAX are down. It means all the people panicking can't do anything to decrease the value.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:20:44
Personally, I'd wait a sec. The next support line is $12.7, and we may see a dip at $13.  But don't buy there.  Be cautious. Its been going up since 6am very slowly.  As much as I don't want there to be a drop.  There most likely will be one within the next 30 min to an hour imo. So I'd wait and see and buy at that next obvious dip.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:12:36
HODL, its going thru re-growing pains right now. Look at a chart and you'll see that its slowly breaking through every ceiling.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:23:52
This is also true.  Let's just hope that its down long enough for Bitcoin to build back up to where people feel safe.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:44:05
Look at that beautiful fucking jump.  I drew my trend line up at 9am and it hasn't fallen below since. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:15:21
Next 15 min is about to get shakey
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:39:55
Personally, I don't think this huge drop was due to a few big investors.  I thought that yesterday until I realized a South Korean Exchange was recently hacked into.  Whoever hacked them took about $60B worth of coins. The Korean Exchange went bankrupt.  I think whoever hacked was selling those coins yesterday. Dropping almost 50% of the market and all the panickers behind them. Just my take.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:50:36
Stay away from "The Greatest Panini".  He's just trying to scare you.  Right now we're on a decent uphill battle back up. I drew a trend line 2 hours ago and no candles have dropped below it yet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:51:31
BUY or HODL. Don't sell. It's making progress!
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:27:12
1.) Put in an amount you are OK with losing (even if its low)
2.) Wait to buy for the best dip
3.) HODL 
4.) Sell when it hits a REALISTIC percentage increase
5.) Repeat
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:19:23
At this rate we'll all be dead soon
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:28:48
These last 10 minutes of it dropping could have been a lot worse.  I think its stable. May even go up a bit more and break thru in the next 15 min.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:35:05
Send it to my account, I'll know what to do with it
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:04:50
nAhhhh nobody listens anymOe
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:43:30
I wonder what the odds are that huge investors, are in the end trying to play both markets.  Jump back and forth. Because the stock market for 2017 steadily rose and didn't flinch. And in 2018 it may not do as well possibly. And now that the crypto market has taken a fall, might be the right time for them to jump in into a new market. Just a thought. Not predicting anything so don't hold me to that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:51:57
Well even Ripple is taking a hit.  It's just sustaining.  It was at like $1.10 about 3 hours ago.

@_date: 2017-12-22 15:46:17
HODL errybody.  The more you sell, expecting it to go down to buy another dip, the more it stays within a certain range and doesn't grow.  Today is about BYUing and HODLing to make up for yesterdays shitty lows.
