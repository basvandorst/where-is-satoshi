GREETINGS from the future!
The happening hasn't happened yet, so the wait is still on.

Bitcoin is money and doesn't care if you are a man, or a woman. 
I do not speak for anyone but myself, but I would be surprised if more people do not agree with this. Do you have any evidence for this? I am not just going to accept what you say without proof.
What has Gavin said that made you "uncomfortable"? 
So what if 95% of the people involved in the community are men? There is absolutely nothing prohibiting women from becoming developers themselves. 
Are you really offended by the pronouns the community uses to describe Nakamoto? Who gives a fuck if he is a man or she is a woman?

Or other filesystems BTRFS, EXT4, ZFS.

If you could reference a specific frame of time, that would be nice. 
It's early, there are bound to be failures, I don't think that it is a good comparison. I mean, the dollar is a super centralized asset that can be printed on a whim by the bankers at top. 
I do think you are over simplifying the dollars position a little bit.
It might be the world reserve currency now. But certainly not forever. The worlds central banks have all announced new stages of Quantitative easing. The Fed will probably announce a new stage of QE sooner or later. These currencies are being used to prop up banks and governments against the long term sustainability of those economies.
I do think that the ship is going to take off later rather than sooner.
I don't know if, say, the Winklevoss twins owning millions of bitcoin is a bad thing. They made the investment, they took the risk. JP Morgan holds the economy hostage and they get rewarded for that.
What do you think *would* have to happen in order to get the ball rolling?

Couldn't banks also integrate some type of blockchain to transmit money over their networks?
@_date: 2014-11-18 02:58:28
How do you know that? 
I certainly can't say sooner than later, because I don't know what is gonna make people switch,  but maybe you know something I don't.

It really has only stopped recently. And even then not really. 
Printing money affects everyone, although not equally nor does it affect everyone at the same time. 
But it still affects everyone. When it will affect everyone is up to debate. 
Here is why it hasn't become apparent yet. 
The graph shows that total transaction amount has decreased drastically, as you can see.
This graph can show you supply of Dollars that have been printed.
Something's got to give.

Consider any Web wallet as secure as the computer your using it own, plus the unknown state of their server security. Cold storage is king. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 22:18:00
Oh don't worry, I understood you, nor was it my intention to insinuate otherwise. I think it will happen later rather than sooner.
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:26:45
Not every web wallet is open source.
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:00:39
You have no way of seeing if they're telling the truth.

Why should I install a virus scanner on my linux based PC?
@_date: 2014-10-02 21:47:55
Por que no los dos?
@_date: 2014-11-14 04:27:05
It will still have the same issues as the current centralised model, it will be closed, proprietary, and all that is wrong with this world, but given that the blockchain can confirm transactions quicker, at a lower cost, and can maintain records just as well, I don't see why banks aren't looking into integrating some of these software.
@_date: 2014-11-24 17:16:57
If you think that bitcoin cannot replace the dollar, do you think it can disrupt it?

I think that saying short time preference is clearer than high time preference. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:24:16
Oh, well, this clears things up! How nice!
@_date: 2014-11-08 19:58:10
I just don't know of any.

However, scientists are still humans, and can be as politically motivated as any of us.

Like the drug cartels are also a free market correct?

dolartoday.com   
A lot of Venezuelans use this website as the metric for the black market exchange rate. I don't know if he is using this website.

Don't forget about speculators.
