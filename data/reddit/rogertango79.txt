Yeah but it's "free" to join facebook and requires no effort relative to the complexity of even understanding what a bitcoin is. So I think the adoption curve might look a bit different. I'm all for a billion Bitcoin users it just won't be that steep.

computer with wallet for lots and lots and lots of bitcoins....

They are my transactions.
When you play SD even if you loose you get 1 satoshi back. These amounts as they grow become unusable as the fee to move them is much larger than the individual inputs of each transactions.

Well their product line makes total sense:
50 GH/s is $14.9K and 60GH/s is $13.5k
They are based in prague.
Will only buy from them if i can give them all my bitcoins

It's better than the current system. The micro-transactions are destroying Bitcoins everyday. I have a wallet with 0.2 BTC in it that I can't use because of SD 1 satoshi payments flooding every corner of my wallet.
Better yet read the log to see why and what's going on before jumping to conclusions:

Yeah, I didn't know how screwed up satoshi dice was. And I'll have you know that I turned 2 btc into 6 btc and then lost it all. lol

Actually it's not SD faults, It's blockchain.info fault for providing a way to play 10 times in a row with one click.
