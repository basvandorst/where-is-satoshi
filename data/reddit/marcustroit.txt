Didn't know that this could affect the market so much. I've been using bitmarket long time ago, it was one of the oldest crypto-platform from Poland. Glad that I switched to coindeal...

I thought that benthall was imprisoned for couple months, when he was waiting for his trial. Anyway, there always will be a dispute when it comes to length of sentence. Every case is different, every court will judge differently. Sad but true

According [to their twitter]( it looks like they are finally available in US: "We've recently announced we are beginning to expand in the US. Step by step, we achieve this goal". I just wonder in which states first o\_O?

"Some cryptocurrency platforms have been slow in adopting it" - slow is an euphemism here. Huge number of transactions are being done on bech32 addresses and biggest exchanges are still during the test-phase. It's ridiculous that it's taking them so long to let people enjoy lower fees, especially when the share of transactions will definitely continue to trend upwards. It can be done in a different way, for example you have Coindeal exchange - they are having 50% discount on btc segwit withdrawals for months right now and such huge platform like Bitmex is introducing it just now.
