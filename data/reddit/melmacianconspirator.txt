Of course they can. The USD is a very popular currency and it's dropped like 99% in value compared to Bitcoin in just a couple of years! :D

Getting rid of them would mean sending them to an address from where they were irretrievable. 
At the time there wasn't much of an economy around bitcoin, but today holding a million bitcoin would give Satoshi economic influence over decisions that perhaps he wouldn't want to appear to have.

I wouldn't want to do anything with someone else's property. Satoshi would have needed to make the decision.
I was curious if it was ever discussed but I'm guessing I would need to look at bitcointalk.org to learn more.

Was there ever a discussion back when Satoshi was actively communicating about the pros and cons of getting rid of the ~1 million BTC that was mined early on?

I fed some chickens on pollofeed.com. Otherwise I pretty much hold on to it.

Roger is obviously pretending to be a little bit more ignorant than he really is here, but it seems like a better automatic fee adjustment mechanism is pretty critical for Bitcoin to work for regular users.

A huge false flag operation by the cowardly leftists, desperate to make Alex Jones and the alt-right look bad.

Why do you assume that most people haven't sold their BCH? I'm not saying you're wrong, just wondering what it's based on.
