What a fucking racist.

I hope they could help out Venezuela too.

These might help. Especially the videos, I'm a noob as well and those made it easier for me to understand.

I also have mixed feelings about KYC, but I'm trying to look at it in a positive note. I mean, as long as you're not doing anything illegal there shouldn't be anything to be worried about. Another alternative to Localbitcoins is Paxful, it's what i'm currently using. They don't require KYC until you reach a trade volume equivalent to 1500 USD, if i'm not mistaken.
@_date: 2019-03-28 12:45:56
As mentioned before, I have mixed feelings about it. I agree with the fact that KYC destroys the concept of Bitcoin but thousands of people are losing their money cause of the loopholes of not having KYC in some platforms. Unless you have other solutions as to how p2p bitcoin marketplaces can combat scammers, rippers and money launderers on their platforms, then feel free to share.
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:04:35
Optional KYC? How do they deal with dishonest users? And charge backs? I don't know how I feel about it as of the moment since the exchange is fairly new and it's a little too good too be true, honestly speaking. Staying on the safe side first and look for feedback and information from people.
@_date: 2019-03-19 12:04:10
there's another p2p bitcoin marketplace that is known for having a variety of payment methods. i would mention it here but apparently, users that mention that platform are getting banned from participating in this subreddit and i'd like to prevent that from happening to myself. so just message me of you're interested to know. good luck, OP!
@_date: 2018-10-10 10:45:49
I agree, but it's unavoidable. This is why all should trade smart, always check other buyers' feedback on the vendor. If you've ever encountered a scammer, report it immediately. They have awesome customer support
@_date: 2018-10-10 10:36:46
Agree, i think that having awesome customer support makes a platform a good one.
@_date: 2019-03-04 13:39:51
Hmmm. The last time I checked, Bisq users were complaining about the platform charging high trading commission. On top of that, they lack no. of trading pairs. Not sure about the state of it now cause I checked it when I was looking for a P2P Bitcoin site to use, now I use Paxful.
@_date: 2019-03-19 10:44:03
Man, that is awful. Any response from their moderators yet? If you can gather proof/evidence against the seller, you should send it as well.
@_date: 2019-02-27 08:46:21
Of course. Money is a crucial topic, it's important that he knows. Transparency.
@_date: 2019-02-27 09:01:09
I don't think there's any way you can buy anonymously through paypal. Try buying BTC with another payment method like Bitcoin ATMs or using gift cards.

*Ooooooof,* compromised.

I applaud you for contributing to Bitcoin adoption! More power to your business!

Aw, cute. A hater.
@_date: 2018-11-08 10:53:11
If they only knew how shitty that platform is. Lol
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:20:01
really? even if it's risky?

I hear that a lot about Bisq. But I haven't tried it yet
@_date: 2019-01-15 08:32:58
@_date: 2019-01-30 15:57:56
This is amazing! Love that this company actually does something to help those who are in need, they actually deserve to be acknowledged.
@_date: 2019-01-15 10:04:20
best comment in this thread. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 11:57:45
Actually, Paxful has better customer service than LocalBitcoins. Experienced it first-hand and it was horrible tbh. I filed a dispute but it was never resolved, it was either they face me with lame-ass excuses or they won't respond to you at all.
@_date: 2019-01-17 10:41:07
But I read somewhere here in reddit that Bisq forces both traders to make a security deposit? Revealing info about themselves which drives users away. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 13:12:07
Not sure if what I read was real, but there aren't much traders in there?
@_date: 2019-01-16 10:33:05
True, I wonder how things are working out between the Venezuelans and LocalBitcoins. Now that the trade volume there is doubling, i'm curious how their support services are holding up.
@_date: 2019-01-21 11:44:09
That is definitely a fake app. They only made an announcement about Paxful 2.0, but none about the app yet.
@_date: 2019-01-09 09:15:41
most p2p marketplaces I know have several payment methods that include credit/debit cards
@_date: 2019-01-15 10:01:29
Ooooh, now that's a cool way to introduce BTC. LOL. Good job, man.
@_date: 2019-01-15 08:29:51
They have a 24/7 live chat support if you need anything. It has a similar concept with eBay, they connect the buyer and the seller so you have to be wary. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 11:56:53
What could be the reason hmmm
@_date: 2019-01-17 13:16:19
Have you tried peer to peer exchanges before?
@_date: 2019-01-21 11:36:40
that would depend on the vendor's offer. it varies from vendor to vendor.
@_date: 2019-01-11 12:11:32
Great read! The article came right on time, the holiday season just ended.

@_date: 2018-12-11 18:16:23
Not doing enough research before getting into Bitcoin/cryptocurrency is a common mistake that most people do. In most cases, these people are the ones that are prone to getting hacked/scammed cause they didn't give themselves enough time to learn Bitcoin and the works. It shouldn't be an excuse tbh.
@_date: 2018-12-30 12:39:40
But isn't getting proper information about what you're getting into is what you're supposed to do? I mean, that's basically common sense. Well it could depend on every individual, whether they're someone who likes to play it safe or they're someone that has a loose grip on money.
