It's easy, just say that it is a cryptocurrency but it's actually a sql db.

Well, abuses already happen, but the justice system cannot be held properly accountable without polycentric law.

WOW, LOOK AT THE FILTHY WESTERN SPY HERE, QUESTIONING THE GREAT LEADER. /s

@_date: 2017-12-04 17:50:08
And what if people want to have more things  than the government thinks it's fair? What if they want to accumulate wealth? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:49:26
Sell the rights to pursue the case to someone, as they will get the fine, not you.

Regulatory capture can only happen in a government-existing scenario.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:50:40
How would you achieve that without a civil war? How would you maintain it that way without strong police repression? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:36:37
Why would someone that wants the state to control everything like a decentralized store of value?
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:31:22
This better be trolling.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:38:32
I would argue for free market police and justice, just stop paying the shitty ones.
@_date: 2018-08-10 04:49:37
Who's better? He's the only sensible one, it could bring us out of this backwather protectionism and regulatory shitstorm, we'll worry about the weed and abortions later. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:20:58
Oh, they do, at least all of the Argentinians I spoke to hated the government and how it was fucking the market.

A big part of bitcoin is about the community around it, be it miners, devs, or the plain old user, so it makes sense to talk about things like this as early as possible. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:46:01
I fully expect to be alive in 2140, why wouldn't I? 
@_date: 2017-01-14 03:00:50
transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:54:55
If there is no cap bitcoin will fall flat on it's stomach.

Wires are more useful, it has that nice conductivity. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:57:52
There is the ethical argument of being able to defend yourself even if the police are absent.
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:45:22
While I agree with the idea that's a very relevant username.

I'm planning on being financially independent by 50, mantaining a modest income and saving 30% of my income, it's not impossible.

Europe is killing itself. 
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:20:23
Save first then finance the house, use the compounding interest rates in your favour.
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:45:20
That's called financial independence.

Because you value a pizza now more than the theoretical 2x increase later. 
Good old marginal utility valuation.

Filthy keynesian.

Yep, I agree.

Rabo is also a slang for good ass in Brazil.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:45:41
Thank you for the explanation. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 05:26:27
Fuck them, then.

Traditional currencies can be inflated at whim, crypto not so much.

What about the fact that we have animals that live in altruistic colonies with little to no blood relation with each other? Is that not evolution? Are we not the result of evolution?
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:20:29
Tax heaven is another way of saying that it does not help the plundering of its citizens by the largest criminal enterprises.

This assumes that there is no such thing as a network effect with the miners and users. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:40:59
Why do you sign your comments, Ben? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:36:35
Yes, we do not want manipulation.

I don't know about equality, more like justice.

Inherited money lasts up to 3 generations, usually. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 07:19:32
And so is language.
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:30:43
That is unenforceable.

@_date: 2018-02-10 00:13:49
What a ride.
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:17:45
I agree with you. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:30:43
That is unenforceable.

Fiat and commodities are two very distinct classes of financial assets, and gold can be mined in space, one little asteroid and the price plummets. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:34:22
That's some broken English. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:47:31
It's a common thing.
@_date: 2017-09-17 07:18:17
B-but taxation is theft.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:02:42
It's an ideology thing.
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:30:32
The alternative is everyone collaborating in the plunder, each plundering for itself and competing on tax code is better than an agreement on the plundering. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 06:28:06
Shit banker coin.
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:27:06
Still better than the alternative, which has governments cooperating in the plunder, Malta can be used as a heaven from them.
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:17:18
What were you saying then?
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:53:18
I don't think I should have to ask permission to the government to exchange any property. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:48:30
Well, lightning networks are going to be a thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:48:54
How can people have things without the government letting them, that's absurd, they should learn to bend down to their masters, right? ^/s
