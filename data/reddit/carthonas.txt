Bitcoin would look better if it was spendable everywhere and didn't fluctuate in price like the speculative asset which it ultimately is.

All I'm saying is if anyone thinks a multi trillion dollar global economy can run on the basis 22,000,000 Bitcoins they're out of their goddamn minds.

If everyone started using Bitcoins, the price would skyrocket since the Bitcoin money supply is basically static. This means new users would be quickly priced out, and hoarding would become an issue.
Bitcoin is nothing more than a speculative asset as long as there's no way to increase the money supply beyond the final 22 million Bitcoins or whatever the number is.

So how are we going to explain all of that to John Q. Public who just wants to go down to the corner store to buy a sodie pop with his dollars? Mr. Public can barely send an email from a smartphone, how do you expect Mr. Public to pay for his sodie pop with bitcoin? How will mass adoption to ever be feasible?
The Established system is so deeply ingrained into our collective culturally history, it will take many generations to change. Mathematically it works, but mathematically we can also build warp drives. It doesn't mean we'll ever see it.

Global currency would need price stability, which would be impossible without the ability of a central bank to manipulate money supply at will 
@_date: 2014-08-24 12:38:54
How do we address the argument that price stability is impossible to achieve given thay money supply is virtually static, and cannot respond to monetary demand

If you gain wealth by illegal means (dealing drugs for example), convert that wealth into BTC, then convert those BTC into dollars - that's money laundering. 
So long as the original wealth wasn't gained by illegal means there's no laundering going on, seeing as how it wasn't 'dirty' in the first place.

It's almost as ludicrous as having no guarantee of price stability.
Imagine if the value of the US Dollar changed as dramatically as Bitcoin, there'd be no economy to speak of, everyone would just be hoarding and/or dumping currency, speculating on tomorrow's price.
When a national currency changes by 1% in 24 hours it's a monuments, earth shattering event. When Bitcoin changes by 1% in 24 hours it's a pretty average day. This is because national currencies have central bank guaranteed price stability, and Bitcoin does not. 
Bitcoin is a great niche thing and I love it to death but, to act like it could be the basis for a mass-adopted currency in today's economic paradigm (fractional reserve banking) isn't at all plausible. Sure, in the future blockchains could be used as a technology to verify monetary transactions... but the currency would have to be built a central bank or similar authority who controlled the money supply, else there is no price stability and currency speculation runs rampant, and currency becomes a commodity. This is like macro economics 101.

Given Bitcoins price is determined almost completely by monetary demand and there is so mechanism to increase the money supply to meet extreme demand spikes, to this day I still fail to see how Bitcoin isn't ultimately a speculative asset. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:43:23
I think it will be mainstream when people are more inclined to spend it as a currency as opposed to hoarding it and waiting for the price to increase as a speculative asset.

Ooooh man, there's a lot of work to do here haha. 
First of all you said it yourself, there's a maximum supply of 21 million bitcoin, there can never be more. So as the number of users increases (increase in monetary demand) the price of bitcoin increases along with that adoption, since monetary supply is basically static. The price increases with the market cap. This rewards early adopters who owned bitcoin when it was a lower price, because it's a speculative asset. If people decide to leave Bitcoin, the price goes down. The price of bitcoin is determined almost completely by demand for the currency.
"Fiat" currencies aren't backed by commodities because they're backed by the entire economy of the country they represent. The USD is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States,  every citizen collectively contributes to its success or failure, not some commodity sitting in a vault. If the USD was still based on Gold we would need more Gold than exists on the planet to "back" our currency at it's current value because of the behemoth size of our economy. Nixon knew this wasn't feasible which is why our currency is today backed by our entire economy and production capacity. 
Also you need to understand how quantitative easing works, "creating 80,000,000,000 euros each month out of thin air" is a complete mis-characterization. The ECB is taking bad assets off of banks balance sheet to increase liquidity to avoid liquidity traps. Assets aren't being created, the assets already exist as debt on the bank's balance sheet as illiquid assets, which prevents banks from loaning money into the economy. Central Banks buy those assets for face value gives the banks they money the need to operate. No value is created or destroyed, this is why the US Federal Reserve owns like trillions of dollars of mortgage backed securities after saving the US Banking systems ass back in '09-'12...  they didn't print money and give it banks, the fed just bought their illiquid to pump some cash into the economy... AKA Quantitative Easing.
Sure there is sometimes moral hazard here because banks are shady as fuck, but the point is central banks don't just "print money," thats a college sophomore's fever dream. Our current financial system is far from perfect and needs reform, but the needed reform has much more to do with banking eithics more than our paradigm of money. 
Here's some a good place to start if you're interested in learning how the monetary system works:
 (Great into about how the Federal Reserve used monetary policy to both create and resolve crisis in its 100 year history)

Well yea but people don't parade around stocks like a replacement for the US dollar they're just a vessel to hold value a lot like bitcoin

The entire point of the entity of "The State" is to monopolize violence. A fundamental function of The State to be the dominant  powerful actor and keep the overall peace in society. Corruption is inevitable when we're dealing with an institution as large as the United States Government, but that doesn't mean the entire institution is criminal. 
Here is a relevant short story:

Comparing bitcoin markets to old world commodities markets is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. 
Bitcoin blew up because of media coverage and unfettered speculation. It's dropped since the peak because Bitcoin isn't used for much more than a speculative asset or moving money around. Bitcoin supply is static, amd Bitcoin demand has been dropping ever since the 2013 media frenzy.
Without a huge uptick in demand for Bitcoins, the price will never skyrocket.
