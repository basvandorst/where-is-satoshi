This is pretty obvious dumping price to increase position market behavior. It's still a thin enough market that a few hedges can basically swing the price by 10-20% whenever they want to. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:02:26
But none of those reasons are why they banned the subs
@_date: 2014-04-11 21:09:53
I see what you did there, and I approve.
@_date: 2014-09-02 15:07:10
ikr, pretty fluffy stuff but not negative and coming from USA Today which means there is at least some editorial support there.
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:06:09
Wait, shouldn't they have been scrambling to get set up with an exchange a couple of months ago?
@_date: 2014-07-04 15:22:17
I'd love to read the whole story from beginning to end, you've got time don't you? :)

What's dangerous is how embarrassingly cringe worthy this video is and it has over 300 upvotes at 89% currently. This better be on because that's where it belongs. Pretty sad that on a day where my BTC has dropped nearly 10% the worst part of it was watching this video. Just awful.

Yay, some raging scumbag who is probably a key part of the giant conspiracy against which he rails is adopting bitcoin. Woo-freaking-hoo.

You guys just can't stop posting fodder for You are your own worst enemy.

Same for Rogan who likes to talk like he's a world all-star expert on every subject in the history of human kind.
@_date: 2014-04-16 10:12:24
Is anyone realistically thinking they will see anything fiat or not?
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:50:13
As long as we keep selling them "banned" bitcoins for cheap.
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:29:57
I feel like I've seen this exact comment many times. What I haven't seen is anyone coming up with innovative ideas to fix the 51% problem. How a community with a high percentage of eggheads hasn't even attempted to band together to find a solution to this is astonishing.
@_date: 2014-06-14 06:06:00
Bitcoin needs a good dose of Nash equilibrium and this is a good start.
@_date: 2014-04-07 18:55:18
So who are these people who don't understand this very basic principal of bitcoin?

There's not enough volume going through most coins on VOS, and this is hurting them. I think the problem is high fees for casual traders. Their fee structure is insane to me, it just doesn't make any sense at all.
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:13:05
Wow, I'm pretty sure I saw this exact post and exact top comment a few weeks back. At least this sub is rock solid predictable.
@_date: 2014-06-22 13:37:53
Uncover simple solutions to problems no one has
@_date: 2014-10-30 18:33:43
And with that, the biggest rat has fled the ship.
@_date: 2014-07-04 17:55:56
Wow, great that you got them back, I would have thought your chances of getting coins sent to Gox back would be around 0%. Was Karpeles involved at all? I can't imagine that he would have any control whatsoever. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 13:38:26
In a People's Republic, the people are the republic that's exactly the problem.
@_date: 2014-05-02 03:11:56
You're right. I guess we'll have to settle for a $500,000 bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-04 11:54:11
Somebody owes us a story
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:39:57
This changes nothing. The exchanges still can't operate. But whatever. This seems to be the accepted strategy, simply undermine crypto as a currency by calling it a commodity. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 13:55:53
What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
@_date: 2014-12-07 02:16:14
I hear this all the time, and I agree but as long as they exist people will use them. There is no learning not to use them when you have new people adopting. They either don't know or they figure the risk is minimal. Then when people do lose their bitcoins it just creates more fodder for the typical security related FUD. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:48:50
Whatever entities are manipulating this ride, they aren't very imaginative. 500, 450, 400, 350. Come on pick something random at least.
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:15:39
Probably because it's extremely cringe worthy. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 17:10:37
Does everyone in have aspergers or something? Don't you realize that videos like this hurt more than help? This is Steve Balmer "I LOVE THIS COMPANY" level cheesy. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 03:33:01
Honestly, since when is Ken Hess worthy to share a stage with any successful entrepreneur let alone Voorhees? This is baffling to me that anyone would even acknowledge him ever.
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:49:05
No different than Gox, anyone who lost BTC deserves to. It will just keep happening over and over again, people never seem to learn.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:05:46
Yes. I guess the 96% premine sold them on it....wait...
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:01:04
I'm also not Max Keiser
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:33:22
Compared to the 750K that Max Keiser predicts yes.

It was in one of his RT videos during the bubble, I don't want to go through them. But even before the bubble he was making claims of 1-10% of the Forex market like he does [here](
@_date: 2017-02-03 16:31:35
Terrible organization, losing their subscribers and probably won't last another month. SAD.

Like that kid who wanted to make the rules of every game and if you didn't play by them he would go home. Basically Cartman.

Yeah I've really grown to dislike this sub. And while I applaud this post and your efforts to affect change, the comments within tell the real story of how it will never happen. I think I'll just unsub and make my day a little bit less annoying.

Mark Karpeles is either an incompetent boob or a mastermind criminal.
@_date: 2015-04-17 04:48:43
I haven't noticed it being any worse than usual.
@_date: 2015-04-22 11:38:04
I've never had anything to do with ripple but the level of disinformation and naivety in these comments has me concerned for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-18 16:53:11
Oh, that's much worse then.

I think he's right though, I'm convinced of only one thing through all of this: that the real Satoshi is dead.
