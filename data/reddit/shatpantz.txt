"Ethereum will always have more consensus failures than bitcoin.  It has a larger attack surface, and competing implementations.
Ethereum will always be more risky because they abuse the “default option” power over apathetic nodes. Thus any regulator can just have them make aml/kyc/sec reg a requirement and bye bye efficiency.
Ethereum will always have more down time than bitcoin, check out 2017 for instance. (see point 1.)
Ethereum has 3x less reddit users, a couple x less twitter mentions, a few x less wallets, a few x less press, a few x less years of testing, less hardware wallets, less adoption in nearly every way. Where can you spend this “currency?”
Ethereum tricks developers into losing far more money with “smart” contracts that have bugs, than bitcoin does with accidentally sending change to the miner instead of to a new address. Smart contracts will always be dumb as long as you have to trust a signal from the real, non digital world (oracle problem.) If you have to trust any way, then just let the oracle do it all.
There’s nearly no demand for the Ethereum gas you’re supposed to buy to process transactions, because no one really uses it for computing, it’s just speculative platform utility. Gambling on gambling. Which just got banned in china.
Their blockchain is bloated. It grows faster than many users can download it. 
It’s transactions per a second is maybe 3x bitcoin’s. It’s very likely sharding and other solutions will not “work” if you care about immutability/trustlessness.
Ethereum is more centralized, more risky, loses more of peoples money, down more often, and always will be."

As the CFTC is a federal agency I think it's safe to say the US government considers itself a central authority that, having considered and granted approval to CME and CBOE to trade bitcoin futures, maintains an official definition of what bitcoin is supposed to be.

I acquired a new asset at zero cost.
Until I sell the BCH for something it is unrealized gains.
* You come into ownership of BCH.
* Was it income? No, because there is no taxable source - it simply appeared as if you found it in your letterbox one morning; it's not income from BTC because HMRC have already said BTC is a foreign currency, so it would be absurd to say a bunch of currency decided to vote to give you some assets.
* Did you acquire it? No, you didn't give any consideration for it
* So, it must be taxed under CGT provisions as it's a form of property under the Act.
*  Since you didn't acquire it, you didn't spend anything on acquisition, so no acquisition cost.

 A 7.69% speed decrease from 70mph to 65mph is not going to cause gridlock. Even if the speed of the car dropped to 0pmh, a single car isn't going to cause gridlock.
Even if the number of upvotes for the topic dropped to 0, that doesn't inherently mean the post is spam. It would just mean it's not of interest to people, which would probably be virtually impossible in the foreseeable future until fees/scaling are fixed, given the nature of this forum and the number of new subs daily.

@_date: 2017-12-28 13:49:08
As another commenter pointed out, if ledger is not completely open source it's because they use a security chip which makes the device more secure than a Trezor.
Secure Elements are a critical part of a security architecture to provide protection against physical attacks and device interdiction.
Why ledger has never been compromised, unlike Trezor.

It's been stated many times that the date you gain access to forked coins is considered a taxable event with a cost basis of zero.
Where?  Under what authority?
My source is common sense.  I can't see people ever being liable for back taxes and/or penalties for coins they may never even be aware they had. It's not viable that a third party could create a taxable event for you against your knowledge. It's a split, the clue is in the term chainsplit. Nothing/no one gifted you anything, the coins never belonged to anyone or anything else but you. It's not reasonable to expect every person that owns any BTC to monitor every shitcoin forked from it. They might never even have access to some of them dispite it technically being theirs.  I would say it's only theirs in the sense a payment they are owed, but have not yet picked up yet is "theirs". 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:16:20

@_date: 2017-12-26 00:36:38
It's still kept in the blockchain. It's just kept in a way that non-segwit clients never see or store the signature.
It moves bytes from the area counted against block size to an area not counted by (presegwit) block size. A non-segwit node never sees and cannot validate segwit signatures. There are two major reasons to do this. 1) Effective block size can be increased without a hard fork. 2) It's nice to have an identifier for the transaction which can't be changed without re-signing the transaction.
