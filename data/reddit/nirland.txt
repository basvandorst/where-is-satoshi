It was until it reverted back up again :/ Now I am a little bit unsure but maybe drop again because the resistans at 12-13k is to strong...

We don't know and btc falling has nothing to do with news it's just correction wich could trigger bearish season if we go bellow support lines

It's not over yet mate, second drop is coming very soon and then it's gonna test real support 8-9k

Yeah come back at 19 Jan around 15:00 and say that shit again mate.

Ok yeah it's way to little volume so it's 99% gonna go down and test support again...you are welcome Update: Estimate ~9k in 12h-48h ;)
Also, check chart history. Same thing happend last time!

It looks exactly like a classic bubble, pop may not happen but it is very possible since everything crypto related is overvalued atm. I would say it's good to short now between 12.5-15k. If it can stay over 15k then I will change plans.
I have an open short position at 12.6k

There is way too little volume so not bullish at all yet.

If your are a smart trader, you cash out everything now into usd and buy when it dips again to the REAL support or you short the market to earn even more.

I agree with you, IF it only drops a little bit the panic will start a chain reaction with so many noobs in the space currently. It's only a matter of time, It could continue pumping for a while but major correction / bubble pop has to happen sometime right? Just look at the chart 1k should be new bottom. It will happen slowly and then come back hopefully in like 2 years..
