Why is cardano better than ethereum?

LN requires the ability to push a penalty transaction on-chain to prevent double spends. So while it may be *unnecessary* it must be feasible.  
Which also means that unbalanced channels where the maximum loss for one party is less than the current transaction fee are unsafe, as you would have to pay more in fees to prevent theft than what you would lose. Which means that actual spendable capacity is equivalent to locked balance - 2*fee for a penalty transaction.

Your manifesto gives a strong vibe of a serial killer calling for race war

I don't know, I actually read the cardano whitepaper and its page and was unable to find anything. I don't mean that I disagree, I was unable to find any actual technical claim. Strong haskell fanaticism though, almost lisp level

It's PaaS. The company has total control over locked bitcoins - which means there's no point to the rootstock blockchain at all.  
They can be ordered by the court to give back eg. stolen bitcoins regardless of what happened with them on the rootstock blockchain - which means being forced to break the peg.  
Dangers like these are the reason why decentralization is important.

I verified your statement. Just finished doing a full validation - [it only took 25 hours on a mid-range desktop pc]( and takes 44.3GB of disk space, all blocks included.

The Ethereum blockchain is small, the main problem is that geth doesn't do state pruning after initial syncing. 
It's also slow.

Yes, they are generated from executing blocks.  
Look at [this]( image. The default behavior of bitcoin core node right now is 6. 7 is called pruning in bitcoin. 8 is SPV. 3 is closest to txindex=1. There's no equivalent archival mode at all. The equivalent would be a full database like [abe](

You don't understand what an archive node is. It's a collection of historical *results* of executing the blockchain. Pruning in ethereum means removing old states. Pruning in bitcoin means removing old *blocks*. The closest thing to an archival node in bitcoin is txindex=1 but that still removes old utxo sets.

Which is the reason why resistive electric heaters are rarely used. Heat pumps can convert 1kW of electric power into 3kW of thermal.
