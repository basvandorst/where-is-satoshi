Going from the last few years history, sitting on it and perhaps withdrawing a small portion from time to time seems to be the smartest thing to do with it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:03:10
Fun idea :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:35:17
Probably not
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:51:05
Coinbase, its so simple you'll kick yourself.

NOD32 is complainng about some javascript on that site.

Zimbabwe dollars?
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:44:29
Just a couple of basement dwelling skiddies, nothing to see here.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:20:42
Maybe they don't reside in the US, crazy idea I know.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:29:33
Timing it? Yes. Successfully? No

G̶R̶E̶E̶D HODL IS GOOD!

You mean to tell me I'm part of the 1% and didn't even know it???!!
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:32:10
I'll tell you the answer in 3 years.
RemindMe! 3 years

It may just be an anti fraud feature built into their affilate system. Maybe leave it a day or two and then get in touch with support, I'm sure you'll get your credit.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:09:55
Make it burn daddy.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:26:45
I assume you won't be investing?
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:47:31
Why Fire? Why cant you go straight to Revolut? Have they blocked transfers from Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:33:27
Yeah I'm a little foggy myself.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:18:18
That's good to know, thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:10:44
Yes just as the price of a gold bar you had hidden under your floor boards would increase as gold price rises. Same concept.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:20:33
There's no excuse for it in 2017.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:23:47
Coinbase is a good starting place to get comfortable and then perhaps their exchange GDAX once you are settled in.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:20:50
People were asking the same question when it was at 200,500,1000,2000 you get the picture.
Some speculate it to be around 40k at the end of next year. It wouldn't seem like you came in too late if that scenario panned out huh?
As others typically advise, invest what you can afford to lose. Don't panic should you see it dipping, this is typical as Bitcoin is very volatile. You will almost certainly see a nice return on your investment.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:22:50
Right there with you :( Waiting on a damn replacement 2FA device from my bank before I can initiate a SEPA transfer.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:02:31
I mean 4k would be great.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:11:58
GDAX has a big scarey button titled Enable Margin Trading that I know I must not press.
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:51:51
Revolut is a good option. Added bonus is it keeps any bitcoin references off your bank statements.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:48:19
This thing isn't ready for the horde of mindless drones on YouTube yet.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:24:54
People were saying that when it was at 3000, no it isn't too late. Theoretically? How long is a piece of string. No one knows but some think a lot. It could easily reach 20k in the not too distant future (imo).
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:14:57
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:07:32
Nope, Windows, Linux, OSX, Android.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:37:16
localbitcoins.com is probably your best bet.

Just gently remind him of the conversation when he asks for a ride in the Lambo.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:31:01
Sky is falling, its over folks!
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:07:22
Yes, probably best to start small to get comfortable with the process anyway. Coinbase is great for starting out.
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:51:48
20-30, but what the hell do I know? Just a gut feeling.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:58:32
Have you purchased from Coinbase yourself with your account?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:27:18
Can you not sell for USD and eat any conversion fee from your bank?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:44:47
Hop on bud.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:31:18
This guy knows.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:05:05

We had no business being in the 11k's so soon. This is our penance.

@_date: 2017-11-27 08:22:39
Big correction incoming if you ask me.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:07:46
For a long term investment I say jump in now, sure it will almost certainly dip but that correction will seem miniscule in hind sight if we're going where I (and a lot of others) think we're going.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:03:52
Yeah this is just an elaborate tax dodge imo.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:40:19
Well the coins are held in escrow until the transaction is complete, it's quite safe.
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:14:26
GDAX, part of Coinbase but lower fees.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:07:45
Yes get them in a wallet, preferably a hardware wallet. If the exchange disappears one day so do your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:00:07
Move it to USD wallet on Coinbase and then transfer it to your bank, eating any currency exchange fees your bank may charge. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:06:09
Another vote for Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:30:48
Hmm is the email in your junkbox or regular inbox? Some email clients will remove links if its perceived as junk.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:13:56
Are you looking to buy or store coins you already own?
