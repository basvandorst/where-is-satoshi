I like the way this looks. And of course you're right -- if the growth does turn out to be exponential, then we'll have to rejig it once again as well as probably implementing other scaling solutions, but it's a good compromise that I hope will bring the community back together a little. Good now will always trump great later in my book.

I'm glad to hear it, though I can't help but express a little pessimism that all miners would respond the same way.

Oh please let that be true. Let the only things the founder of Bitcoin says online since 2013 be some adorable faces, changetips, the words "to the moon," and the words ["on the internet, nobody knows you're a toaster."](

But, in theory at least, the increase should eventually lead to more nodes on the system, because of greater adoption as everything scales up. So even if your node goes down (which would be bad) others will likely rise to take its place in a scaled-up Bitcoin. Roger Ver basically makes this case [here.](

Just a question: if BIP 101 is, by some contingency of fate, accepted by the vast majority of miners and end users, doesn't the way Bitcoin works essentially make the BIP 101 the valid chain?
@_date: 2015-08-27 20:29:47
So at that point, the blocks bigger than 1MB will be valid blocks? I think you and may have been in violent agreement, that's all. I think his line of thinking was just that if BIP 101 is implemented (i.e. if it gets more than the 75% mining needed), there won't be a split, there'll just be a mass conversion in the two week grace period, in which case there wouldn't really *be* another viable chain. Am I reading that right ?
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:31:24
I'll alter your wager slightly -- I think folks running BIP 101 will be happy to signal BIP 100 support, but will stay BIP 101 until they see BIP 100 actually coded.

But that's because there are no economic incentives that would kill off a much less popular fork of Linux; nobody loses value if they run their own version and it's just them and a few of their buddies. Bitcoin has very powerful economic incentives for everyone to abandon the weaker side of a fork. So you won't ever end up with hundreds of different versions. At the most, you'd just get hundreds of either failed or successful redirections, no?

Both, which is why we have both entrepreneurs and academics in the cryptocurrency space on our board of directors. We don't want to be limited to just traditional academic views, but would definitely like to follow the academic peer-review process in an open way.

So, I think you're confusing measuring consensus with creating consensus. For better or worse, the 75% number would create a consensus -- vendors would not hold out to keep a coin that wouldn't be mined by the majority, it would make them lose money. When I wrote about the breaking of equilibrium, this is exactly what I meant. Bitcoin seems to me to be a system where, inherently, miners control hard forks. When 75% of miners go, the other 25% of miners will go. Vendors won't go with a coin with only a tiny number of miners, because it's too insecure (see my comment about the 51% attack). It's in nobody's interest, that I can see, to stick with small blocks if 75% of the miners have agreed to mine larger blocks. 
Now we can have a philosophical debate about whether it's ethical to release a piece of software that offers miners the chance to hard fork, but it's also important to keep in mind that that's exactly the system that Bitcoin is. There won't be two coins unless equilibrium is somehow maintained, and I fail to see how that could happen, unless miners worked against their own best interests to destabilize the system by deliberately spoofing XT into triggering, maintaining the ruse for two further weeks (which would only enhance consensus with vendors) and then switching away at the last minute -- which would be really *really* dumb of the miners, but I guess stupidity can't be totally eliminated.
Basically, I think the way Mike sees it is that 75% is enough to build a consensus on, the way that it's enough to win a solid mandate in an election. Because when things get big, 95% consensus is unrealistic, so we go with 50%+1 vote and everybody else has to go along with it until the next election. I'm not saying I agree 100%, but I think that's his point of view and why he's picked 75%.

We have one, but unfortunately with the OJS system their ability to change the layouts is limited to basic CSS changes. I, too, lament the decided mediocre look of online academic journals (and perhaps one day, down the road, it will improve). If you take a look at the Author Guidelines pdf, it will give you an idea of what the papers will look like. I hope they're more to your liking as we had more freedom there.

I agree, but making it physical takes away some of the things we really like about the digital -- unlimited space, for instance.

And we don't want it to be ivory-towerish, which is why we have both academics and industry professionals involved. In this sense, "academic" means at least two useful things. First, it means that it's carried out according to the standards of peer reviewed academic journals -- meaning submissions are required to meet certain standards of intellectual rigor (an awareness of other scholarship, for instance, or the absence of obvious logical or rhetorical leaps). Second, it means that it will (after a few issues are published) be indexed in academic journal indices, making it easier to have a record of the development of ideas, and therefore easier to interact with the growing body of research. We absolutely *don't* want to try to turn Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) into something only accessible to those with degrees, as that would cut off large numbers of highly intelligent, talented, and skilled people currently working in the field.

Oh maybe some people who volunteer for the journal get money from the government in a roundabout way during their day jobs -- I'm not one of them, of course, not working for a public university -- but in terms of being paid to work on the journal, well, nobody does. We pay the publisher on a yearly basis, and volunteer our time. So I think calling it a government publication would be a wee bit of a stretch. Unless, you know, taking a personal exemption on your taxes makes you a government employee. Then we're all totally government shills.
But hey, NSA, if you're listening in, I'd *love* a big fat check for editing an academic journal. Send me some of that sweet, sweet government black ops budget if you're interested.

I feel like I should probably point out that it's a cryptocurrency-only academic journal, so not *only* Bitcoin (though many of us involved are self-avowed "bitcoiners," to be sure).

Well, here's how I'm thinking about it, and you can let me know if you disagree or partly agree or whatnot. 
First there's the matter of stability. If only a small number of miners switch to a new standard in a hard fork, they'll have more than enough mining share to render the system insecure by way of a 51% attack, which will shake a lot of faith in the coin as a store of value, and people will stay with the more popular currency. 
There's also the matter of usefulness. A currency is only as useful as it is widely accepted. If only a small number of vendors start accepting the new coin, it becomes essentially worthless because it can't be spent. The value drops, people abandon it, and it becomes another meaningless altcoin, meanwhile Bitcoin remains Bitcoin.
What would have to happen -- what would be the perfect storm of things that could happen -- to make Bitcoin fork in two? First, you'd need a relatively even split, in both miners and vendors. Vendors could, en masse, decide to accept both coins and both blockchains as valid but equal. Miners, because resources are limited in the real world, would pick one or the other. If about half the miners went one way and half went the other, then in theory you could have two stable blockchains, but I'm doubtful it'd ever happen. Why? Money makes people conservative. No miner wants to be on the wrong side, and they're going to be very sensitive to it. If it looks like one side is going to "win," (and the other "lose") enough will switch to break the equilibrium, and once that happens anyone else will switch for fear of being left out. Being left out means losing money -- more and more as time goes by in a divided blockchain.
Thankfully we don't stand a chance of that happening with XT, because of the 75% on switch. At that point, I'd argue that equilibrium is already broken, and the remaining 25% of miners will switch -- and where the miners go, the rest of the Bitcoin economy will follow.
But I have to admit the slight possibility, in my understanding, of a potential hard fork split in the absence of a consensus activation switch like the one present in XT. But in that case, it's doubtful to my mind that anyone would run the new one, for fear of that exact thing taking place. Nobody wants to be on the losing side. Thoughts?
Edit: forgot to mention that vendors don't want to accept currency that might at any time lose its value, so they'd probably start converting to fiat immediately after any transactions... and to do that, people like coinbase and other exchanges would have to have stayed on the fence, too.

Well, yes, among to the core devs. But that's pretty much been the case the whole time, hasn't it? Anyway, until they come up with (read: release) a non lightning-network scaling solution, it's nice to have something the Bitcoin network can implement should an emergency occur.

It's also technically possible he was a part of the possibly multi-person "satoshi nakamoto" but not the part that had the keys, and so he literally *can't* sign from the genesis block or move early coins, I suppose. Imagine that: "I'm Satoshi!" "Keys or GTFO" "I lost them." Hopeless.

Yeah, the real innovation isn't a shared ledger, or even the "trustless" nature of the blockchain. It's the brilliant harnessing of competing interests and incentives that renders the system stable. And I haven't seen another shared ledger system yet that does such a good job of that.
