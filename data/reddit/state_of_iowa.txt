it's not like stock in a company. you pay for 'educational materials' and are rewarded with 'mined' coins, of which there is no proof it has occurred. you don't own any equity in the company from having onecoins. they can't be spent anywhere. they can't be traded anywhere other than their internal market i.e. no other market trades onecoin. 
many 'members' were already arrested in China. it's a giant ponzi scheme just like other MLM bullshit. their own videos explain that you will receive 60% of your commissions made from your referrals in cash, and 40% in onecoin. in other words, you have to sell onecoin to other people in order to make money. mining is not possible. and straight up buying them is not even possible. you just 'earn' the right to buy onecoin. 
it's also not a Thai company. it's on an 'observation' list in multiple countries. it ceased operations in Bulgaria after warnings. it's bad news. at the very least, the authorities need to have it on their radar.

it's not an altcoin. it's a fake coin. no coins are mined. there is not enough proof a blockchain exists. it was built off of an MLM scam. they adjust the value of the coins as they please.

i am in Thailand but i wouldn't know how to approach that office or another. i'd be worried it could backfire on me.
still, they should be watching out for this guy  Swedish scumbag who has made millions off of it and comes to Thailand often.

that's the point, people should be educated on how onecoin is a fake coin so it can be taken down before it has any more publicity that reflects badly on the cryptocurrency community, allowing banks and their PR teams to use it as fodder. we need to take a proactive approach to getting rid of scams.

Nowhere. I'm literally sitting at a bank in Cambodia as I type this looking at a bank standup brochure that explicitly informs customers that crypto currency is not legal in Cambodia. What a scam. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:05:06
Agree. I'm at a bank in Phnom Penh as I type this where they have brochures informing customers crypyocurrency is not legal.
