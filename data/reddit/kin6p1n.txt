Bitcoin was rare. Now that there are 20 forks and another stack planned, it's now just a legacy joke. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:26:26
I don't you understand how markets work. You can only bid a market up if you have the liquidity to do so. I highly doubt all the long term holders have great stacks of cash not already in the market.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:04:35
What strength? It's getting owned just like everything else. If bitcoin was going up or holding while everything else was falling I may believe that. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:44:14
What's that based on out of interest? From my point of view it's not doing anything particularly well that's its intended to do and is on a path very far from the true purpose it was created for. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:42:18
Blind faith? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:38:12
Core doesn't view the direction as a design flaw. It's actually the direction they want. If you have a large stack of something would you prefer if people were to hold and not spend theirs which would create a store of value through low supply to meet demand. Or on the flip side, if people were actually spending their savings, additional supply would be available which in a sane world would make the price go down not up. So Core has taken the stance that its better to be a store of value than a functioning currency. Why do you think there is such a HODL movement in the space. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:21:12
You didn't answer the question? Why do you think bitcoin is under valued? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:24:23
**Disclaimer: This is a very basic comment so you would be better served to do some more in depth research if you want hard data** At its most basic it comes back to the problem that bitcoin was/is trying to solve. Providing "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"
Have a look at the opening statement to the bitcoin whitepaper. 
"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution"( 
Bitcoin core is slow and expensive to use so by very design became a store of value as opposed to a means of exchange. The goal of Bcash was to be fast and cheap to use meaning you could actually use it in a currency function if you so desired. Cash is cheap and easy to use so digital cash would need to be even easier and cheaper to use to make sense. 
The Bitcoin crowd used to use a term that the goal behind bitcoin was to "Bank the un-banked" If the cost to use something outweighs its usefulness it will never suit majority of use-cases as things like transaction fee's are a big deal if you don't earn much money. No good using bitcoin if the fee to do so it equal to 20 hours of your labour. There is a lot more to it than that but the minute bitcoin became another tool for the rich was the minute it outlived its usefulness IMO.
Litecoin being the second crypto-currency on a scene has definitely stood the test of time that a lot of newer coins can't say, is by the very design automatically 4 times faster than bitcoinCore, has been stable as far as development for the most part, has never forked its direction (not including the fact that it in itself it basically a fork of the original bitcoin), has already adopted segwit and the lightning network with no issues and will be able to do atomic swaps which means proper decentralized exchanges. 
The list goes on for why i think litecoin is a far better choice than bitcoinCore or Bcash but like anything is life and especially investing do your own research and make up your mind based on your parameters. 
Happy to discuss further as my jumbled thoughts probably don't make sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:43:16
It's the modification to the original source code. 
You are correct in that it never forked the blockchain but due to it having probably as much in common with the open source code as the other bitcoin forks you can see how people still call it a fork. 
Maybe there is a better term out there. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:26:18
If you have invested money in anything and don't know what these terms are you are just straight gambling and following the trend. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:28:39
As much as core bitcoin guys hate on roger you would be blind not to see that bcash is alot closer to the white paper than the current direction core is on. The trend of bitcoin over the last few years is why I switched to litecoin.

@_date: 2014-02-07 21:06:31
Just look at the buy and sell volumes. Looks just like stock volume not currency trading. As the price slides more and more people dump their coins to lock in a profit or stop a loss. It's not like when the USD drops against the AUD people go out and sell there currency. I would suggest the opposite, there is no proof people are actually using btc as currency
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:09:35
If you only use crypto to buy fiat, are you mining them or how did you acquire them in the first place 
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:47:21
Technically you still are not buying anything with btc as its still priced in a fiat currency at you are merely converting the price of btc at that moment into currency to complete the transaction. There are multiple  systems where you can do the same with gold if you so desire, Goldmoney for example. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:20:16
Gold has been a store of value for thousands of years. Btc wasn't even a thought a decade ago. Give it some time to see if it survives long term. If gold was actually in a free un-manipulated market would be interesting what the real comparison would be. My thoughts are precious metals would be smashing it. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 23:00:10
Clearly you have no idea what your talking about. All associated fee's in relation to goldmoney in particular including the use of their debit card setups are 0.5%. Bitpay for instance is 1%? 
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:32:43
Hindsight is 20/20. Remember only a few years ago bitcoin took a dive from a similar level back to the 200/300 mark, i am not saying history is going to repeat but you never know. If someone had said sell at 900 you would have laughed back then also but in the longer term it still may have been sound advice. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 23:11:19
"Separately, "the above mentioned resources" are what secures the network" &gt; Ok fair enough probably a poor example. 
I have seen discussions in the past in relation to the amount of resources dedicated to the task solving the mining task but i have never seen anyone truly elaborate what the cost might actually end up being. 
The cost in 2017 i was referring to is the current cost to actually mine a coin in terms of electricity, infrastructure charges, electronic equipment etc.  If the projection is by 2140 all coins will be mined. i am just wondering what the end cost of the exercise would have been.
To break it down a bit more simpler. (hopefully)
If you had a typical mining setup today and all associated costs to run the machine were frozen indefinitely. If i started today &amp; ran the entire bitcoin mining exercise from start to finish. How long would it take under current projections and what would the ultimate end cost look like?
Does that make sense?   
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:41:58
What's the point of showing this? 
@_date: 2017-03-03 00:20:40
Gold is priced off the back of the paper markets namely the Comex. Nearly all transactions through the comex don't result in physical delivery and in that vain they trade something in the region of 100x actual supply. 
Just do a quick search of the issue and there is tons of resources around the topic. 
Take this example in relation to price manipulation. When Donald trump got elected the price of gold spiked and the price of stocks slumped. To reverse this trend the manipulators dumped paper gold contracts onto the market short &amp; over the period of 3 days around the election victory dumped the equivalent to the entire gold mined over a 3 year period. To aid to this there would be no doubt they wouldn't have been buying equities on the flip side. 
TLDR: Physical gold is priced through a paper exchange mechanism and not a physical one making it easier to manipulate as you can sell gold you don't actually have. (Naked short selling)
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:44:06
Most likely the opposite i would think. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 23:13:51
I was under the impression that the concept that there can never be any more coins produced is only on the basis the protocols don't get changed?. What ever that means. It may not be entirely impossible. Someone in know feel free to correct this statement. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:19:26
I personally get sick of the constant focus on price. Measuring one fiat currency against another has no point. It's like watching a collective of speculative gamblers gloating about how right they are when the price is going up and refuse to see other points of view. If the price of btc in USD dropped back to 100 would it make the concept any less interesting? Would all the people on this thread claiming it's the second coming still be on here saying how good it is.? All the things that make btc great are not measured in USD. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:53:03
No stress.
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:25:34
Agreed they are two totally different things but definitely a more accurate comparison then 1btc to 1 ounce of gold that gets thrown around a lot. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:43:43
To clarify. "All Silver Mined in History - 1,411,475 T" Majority of silver being mined is consumed by industry. Silver has reached peak production and for the past 10 years the world has been consuming more silver then produced. The paper price of silver is heavy manipulated down so if it was a free market the price would be far greater making the price divide even larger. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:24:37
I did the sums off the today's number of bitcoin hence the 16223525 number. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 02:50:22
In a very broad perspective. When gold goes up it makes thier fiat markets look weak. Gold as the original money is direct competition for all government backed fiat currencies around the world. I highly encourage you check out the YouTube series 'hidden secrets of money' by mike Maloney. It breaks down the system in simple terms and it's vital information everyone should be well aware of. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:32:29
I used those two measurements as they are realistically the smallest unit of measure for both. Silver is consumed therefore it's being lost everyday. The technology that i am using to reply to this thread used a tiny bit of silver. As technology expands so will our need for silver. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 03:04:00
As far as my understanding the internet is merely a protocol and the wealth your referring to is from companies building on top of this network to generate value. Whilst the protocol is invaluable it's not where the wealth is created. I see bitcoin similar to this in principal. Is that a reasonable connection to make? 
@_date: 2017-03-03 00:09:01
Perhaps at the very least have a look at the Goldmoney system i am referring to before making statements. 
I am working with the assumption that you already have an amount of gold or bitcoin and want to make a transaction and comparing those costs. Isn't that where this discussion started?                    
@_date: 2017-03-03 10:28:39
So which one is btc. The network or the provider? 
@_date: 2017-01-03 21:02:43
Gold 2.0 is a bit of a stretch. What can bitcoin do other then be a financial tool or currency? 
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:17:05
You make out like if your invested in bitcoin the only other option is fiat. There are plenty other safer places to transfer your investments if that's what your after. Most people aren't invested in fiat but are forced to use it. On the flip side almost everyone in bitcoin is making a clear investment decision. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 21:08:31
Don't get me wrong a am not defending fiat currency by any means. The only thing keeping them afloat as that people are still "using" them and that's the point I was trying to make. If the bitcoin community on the whole isn't prepared to use thier bitcoin and replace fiat currency then what's the point? When the price goes up measured in say USD did bitcoin go up or did the USD go down? It's a mindset thing that if you measure the price of something in fiat currency it's always going to go up as the value of fiat currency is always going down as more and more units and created. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:42:49
Depends, what are your converting it to? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:22:39
In theory you could divide say a element like gold down to the atom but seemly an unlikely situation. Division down to a gram is an accepted unit of measurement. When you enter the digital only world that's a different story.
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:25:21
Or from day one......that's all i am asking. 
Not so much on the suckers angle but definitely on appearance of unit rarity.  
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:19:09
If something has swings of more than 20% at a time. How can the usual bear/bull criteria apply. I think the original intent was that bitcoin hadn't experienced a serious long term bear market similar to gold to see how many people are still signing it's praises. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:08:44
So what's new.?
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:09:56
Wouldn't hold your breathe. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:27:34
Except for the fact that some of those metals are the key backbone to most technologies. Over looking that is like saying that the internet is not constrained by energy requirements. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:25:48
If the people that owned bulk btc at $10 were just blinding gloating about how rich they were and it's going to the moon would anyone have cared? The concept of bitcoin is ground breaking but not because the price has gone up against some fiat money. The more people hype btc only because it's going up will ultimately be it's downfall. So far majority of crypto's haven't actually made good on their promises and there is no sign of that changing in the future. Let's focus on how btc can 'BE' the solution going forward based on what is actually does as opposed to why it might do In the future theoretically.  
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:37:28
To be clear, I am not getting pissy about people gloating when the price goes up. Bitcoin has still got a lot of hurdles to overcome if it's ever going to make it long term. If majority of People only care about price conversion to fiat do you think it's going to make it. Do you think that's what it was created for. Open your eyes. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:26:43
Is that what these subs are for? What happens if the price goes down at any point? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:01:09
Incorrect, copper can be easily substituted for other metals and the world has an oversupply of copper. Maybe do some research? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:03:27
Sure on a two year timeline bitcoin has gone vertical compared to hard assets like gold and silver. The idea behind gold and silver is it's a long term hedge that retains its purchasing power over time. Although going well at the moment the whole idea of bitcoin could just as easily go down to zero as it could go to 1 million. On a flip side, silver for instance is needed in majority of electronic devices and can't be substituted for a lower base metal. If you went one step further without silver there could be no cyrpto's of any sort as the entire computing infrastructure has a core need for silver. All I am saying is you would be crazy to go all in on one idea that may or may not work out long term. Play the numbers and diversify. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:16:11
Its more an observation about the supply argument that is always brought up. I.e there are only ever going to be 21 million bitcoin therefore its rarity is confirmed. While this is true, if i can personally have 1 bit of bitcoin of which there are 210 trillion total it doesn't quite have the sensation of rarity that the larger unit of 21 million does. Its just an observation that i always consider when i keep seeing these comparisons to other assets most commonly gold. The argument usually compares one asset which can not be physically divided any further then two decimal places with another  that can be divide to 8. I.e Ounces of gold to bitcoin. 
It's only a language thing and only really effects how people perceive rarity, i just wonder if it was done on purpose. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:53:21
Guess time will tell. Bit early to call it yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:48:55
From my view. At current bitcoin is acting like an asset not a currency. Although yes you can sell and trade assets (stocks for example) they are far from currency, making any move in or out of them an investment move. Bitcoin in the future may ultimately become a currency but in my opinion that day isn't today. When majority of People talk about buying bitcoin and holding for a future value, that's an investment move. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:15:24
Quality comment. I totally agree with your assessment. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:22:21
Correct. Paper gold is basically the essence of fools gold. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:50:36
Assuming you own any of the mentioned gold and silver. Why would you sell something at its cheapest point in recent history to speculate on a 'new' concept. Sure get into to crypto's instead of fiat investments like stocks and bonds but you would be crazy to liquidate gold and silver at this point in time. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:25:27
Ironically, a useless metal you refer to known as silver is irreplaceable in most forms of current technology. Without it, there would be no bitcoin, no internet, no smart phone, no computer etc etc. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:24:26
Most physical things are hard to measure once they get any smaller which is why 2 decimal places is typically the limit.

@_date: 2017-09-03 19:02:55
What's the bear/bull criteria in the crypto world. I would suggest based in current volitility it would have to be at least double the norm meaning 40% swings to qualify. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:08:57
I would say if bitcoin went proper illegal it would suffer massively. You would be crazy not to think so. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:39:56
Sound approach. Maybe it was just the wording from OP. 
On the point of value. Do you know an accurate way to measure crypto's like bitcoin in relation to current value against a basket of various goods to establish whether or not its sitting above or below where fair market value may lie?
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:24:18
You are making the claim not me. I didn't say it's 100% not?  (Edit: poor spelling)
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:46:29
Interesting points. I especially like the bond villain reference. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:56:19
You are missing the one key factor that is currently letting bitcoin down and why until it changes will never be used as a proper direct currency. "Stable store of value" sure, there is no denying that bitcoin has been retaining and improving its value over time but on a short scale when it matters to most people bitcoin is currently unusable. Untill there is no fiat conversion requires it's volitility is almost guaranteed. If I got paid 5btc and my rent was 1btc then who cares what the fiat conversion was, however we are still very far from that as who would price anything in something (btc) that on average has a 2% day to day price change. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:35:59
I think that untill this space truely experiences a bear market cycle and has a few years of downward spiral there will always be the opinion that if your hold it will go up. Props for putting it out there however, I couldn't agree more. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:35:35
Except for the actuality that all that bitpay does is convert btc to fiat at the point of sale, nothing is actually priced in bitcoin (yet). That in itself is not a new proposition. Before any crypto can ever be remotely considered as currency it must first level out the volatility. No one would ever price anything in bitcoin when the day to day swing might be +/- 10% or more. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:57:25
Answer me this, if the point of buying btc is because you think it's going to be worth more in the future. What's the number that you will actually be willing to part with your btc. No point owning something thats purpose is to exchange for other goods if you never do it. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:40:04
In the governments eyes. Gain is gain. If they want to hit me with tax on an annual interest gain of $17 you can bet they will be all over this. Tax is percentage based, especially vat type ones. Unless I am mistaken they is no vat free zone untill to make a large purchase?  
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:38:18
If it shoots back up. That's the point, when sentiment is crushed the belief is it might never shoot back up. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:27:21
Totally agree. I still find it hard to imagine that only 10 years ago bitcoin didn't even exist. To say that there is no chance that something won't come up in the future that hasn't been created now that might make current gen crypto's insignificant is crazy. If you truly embrace this technology you should embrace bitcoins potential replacement even quicker than you may have accepted bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:14:28
If you just use the known money supply stat's since 2000 the US alone is up 552% and that doesn't include things like the 30+ trillion that was created to bail out all the banks in 08. But for argument sake. $5USD in 2000 to $17USD in 2017. That's like 350-ish% making is still 200-ish% off. The price of silver would have to be more like $30 to even be the same as 2000 but that's still not factoring how much less silver that is available now or how much more demand there is industrially. 
*My numbers could be sketchy but hopefully good enough for this comment to be true.*
@_date: 2017-09-20 00:57:40
Correct me if i am wrong but aren't all the current solutions to make bitcoin transactions faster actually pulling the tech further away from p2p and closer towards the digital models of the traditional financial competition its trying to replace.

@_date: 2017-09-20 00:49:06
I appreciate the people in this space with an actual long term mission as opposed to chasing returns which i feel is majority of the noise in the space right now. My issue i think is i really can't see how bitcoin and its current direction can/will ever be a true currency. Seems to be getting more and more off the path of the original direction i thought its intention was. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:15:14
Would you mind elaborating a bit more. As far as i can tell your saying that because bitcoin is a technology and can be changed and improved that's an advantage that silver doesn't have. Wouldn't it be exactly the same as new industrial uses for the metal are always evolving making its demand change with technology just like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:43:06
Btc does belong to any one country obviously but that's not to say it couldn't be steered in a particular direction by another country. Would you want that possibly? 
@_date: 2017-09-20 06:31:56
I don't understand? Can you expand on your statement a little?
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:25:45
I think if given the choice most people would support and vat or sales tax over a gains tax. Most places have both and that's usually money that's already been taxed at a salary level and charged a vat on a product that's already been taxed 10 different ways already. Makes you really hate the system. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:55:25
Whats your thoughts on the concept that for every one bitcoin there is actually 1,000,000 units that make it up. Would be similar to saying that the new term for $1USD is actually 1,000,000 cents or ($10,000) Does the supply seem more rare even though its the same?
On the price thing: I feel that its value is 'over-represented' purely based on the fact that it still hasn't delivered on a lot of the initial promises and its popularity seems to be driven from price mania than true fundamentals. To me personally it seems very similar to companies that get huge stock valuations based on what they are going to do in the future but aren't doing it in the present. 
It's still such a new technology that the jury is still out whether it will survive long term or not. Although supply of core BTC is capped, with every fork additional BTC variations are created, thousands of alternatives are constantly popping up with various pro's &amp; con's and for the most part the weight of government regulation and intervention is yet to truly impact the scene. 
Whether it's successful of not, its definitely an interesting time to be  paying attention to the space. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:24:49
I agree with your assessment. I often wonder why i get so much resistance when i suggest that bitcoin is and should be an asset not a currency.
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:37:02
politicians perhaps but the bankers that really run the show would be all over this space. 
Surely. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:06:37
Who said anything about silver being money? Bitcoin isn't acting as money any more than silver is. I wasn't trying to make that comparison. Silver is rare, supply is lowest it's ever been and it's real price upside has never been bigger. If I am backwards for thinking this way than so be it.  
@_date: 2017-09-04 04:39:10
I am no expert either. I have been following it for a fair while but still enjoy to challenge the concepts and speculate on the world of tomorrow like everyone else on here. I don't often get much back and forth on here only pitch forks and flames should anyone dare challenge the status quo. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 00:45:34
To be clear, i am not talking about exiting my position in silver at this point in time. I would be selling something at its cheapest point in history to buy something that for all intended purposes is its most expensive. I am more talking about going forward and if i should A: double down and buy more silver or B: by crypto's instead.

I would have thought that bitcoin is definitely large enough to be a concern to the powers that be. 
Including all the BS paper derivatives the silver market is only around 4.5 billion total market cap. That makes Bitcoin around 16 times the size. The silver market is one of the most manipulated in the world, by the central bankers. 
On a side note: when various central banks around world own majority of the apple stock i would say their stock valuation is no where near an accurate reflection of the companies value. 
This also goes for a lot of this current stock market i would assume.

To be clear I think silver is far to rate to be used as money, it's paper price is no reflection on true supply and demand. I am not sure where you got the idea that mining is cheap or that recycling silver is easy. The issue is that silver is used in such small amounts in most modern technology that the cost per ounce would have to be very high to be worth while break down say an old iPhone and savage 0.1g of silver meaning that most silver ever mined has been lost. The world has been using above ground reserves as the consumption is higher then production. The low price that is keeping people away from silver has a double negative that miners are not exploring or bringing new mines online as they are not profitable at the current price and I am not sure what the exact timeline is but I think it takes something like 7 years to bring a mine online. End of the day it's in so much technology that can't be substituted, we consume more then we produce, it takes alot of effort to pull out and ground and refine and it's difficult to recycle. How does any of that suggest that its value is going to be always going down.?

How do forks impact the concept that there is only 21million bitcoin. With every fork additional competing coins are on the scene just in a slightly different configuration. How is this any different to saying that the USD supply is fixed but we can fork off and create usd-cash or usd-classic. Isn't every fork additional units and blockchains being created.

How could something without intrinsic value be an advantage over something that does? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:52:14
Fair enough, that makes the motivation behind obtaining bitcoin make sense from your point of view. Do you have a backup approach if the day when you get paid/use BTC doesn't eventuate?
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:36:21
So do you think that eventually they will weigh in? Wouldn't it be to late by than?
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:15:05
How so?
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:36:33
Sure, i wasn't saying that it wont survive on some level if that scenario did unfold. Physiologically however if bitcoin were to suffer years of continued price destruction and experience a true bear market cycle it would discourage and shake out majority of the current holders who for the most part have only experienced long term gains. If over the course of 3-5 years bitcoin slammed back to $100 or lower most people would be destroyed or leave even though the fundamental principals behind the principal haven't changed only the price movement. 
Have a look into the gold and silver market. The effect of government/central bank intervention and a long term flat/negative price movement has shaken a lot of people out of the section at a time when the fundamentals that probably attracted to them to their position are even better now than any other time in history.

I hope that spread is only refering to crypto's and not your entire investment holdings. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:58:18
Correct; a 'failed currency' by all accounts. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:00:33
The main issue I see with crypto's is that it's still very new and hasn't stood the test of time. If you take an industrial commodity like silver that has a history for thousands of years and then you add the recent transition for its requirement in most forms of technology that has no substitute. It's a pretty hard case to argue that it won't continue to be valuable into the distant future. Give crypto's another 10 years and alot of the doubters would have come around. If crypto's can survive the eventual government crack downs and level out to some form of low volitility then I would say the appeal above and beyond the fomo price to the moon type shit we see going on now would hopefully turn into people using them as a better solution to fiat day to day and not primarily speculating on future worth.

I think that untill this space truely experiences a bear market cycle and has a few years of downward spiral there will always be the opinion that if your hold it will go up. Props for putting it out there however, I couldn't agree more. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:27:51
Why would a country adopt someone elses money when they could just make their own? Even if they copy pasted the core btc framework but just retained direction of the core code to ensure a market takeover from another country. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:13:48
I hope you reported the sale as you have now confirmed that you brought something at $30 then made a confirmed 130x+ gain at sale. You would be crazy to believe all transactions are not tracked/recorded.

That meme is in relation to the bitcoin measure in USD argument. It does not address what i said. If your mentality is that tomorrow something you own is going to be more valuable at what point to you utilize its value? If something is never used than its not valuable at all. Do you see what i am asking. What is your objective behind buying bitcoin and what is your long term plan? The blind logic behind HODL could very well mean that you go from zero to a million back to zero again. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 06:29:24
Don't get me wrong i am not saying that bitcoin is bad only that due to the crazy volatility it would be very difficult for any merchant to price goods in it. 
Take a local electronic's chain near me, they have a no questions asked 7 day return period. This can only function if the $70 i used last week is still worth $70 this week so both parties are not disadvantaged by the passing of time. How do you think bitcoin might get to a point where this wouldn't be an issue.?

I would imagine the day the world actually needs to go off world to get resources the current price of such commodities would have to be, no pun intended, astronomical to make the ROI even remotely tangible. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 00:53:52
Agreed the only decision being considered is Fiat&gt;Silver or Fiat&gt;Bitcion/crypto. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:45:04


Interesting term, i wasn't aware of it. 
Nice. 
It's somewhat true but the exception would be the reasoning for me to take that position has only gotten stronger. Sure price isn't reflecting that at the minute due to intervention, but conceivably it can't go on forever.
One interesting concept that i am hoping will come into play soon is using a blockchain based exchange to set the prices of physical (not futures) commodities based on true supply and demand and ditch the price fix system.

I am familiar with the difference between currency and money. 
**Stability**: bitcoin will never be a currency until its stable enough for goods to be directly priced in it. I am not convinced on the argument that once the price is high enough the volatility will go down. Just this month bitcoin went +/- 30% Profit margins are only getting smaller on most things relying on volume, in which case stability would be a far more important factor then price appreciation. Wouldn't it? Isn't the whole idea behind currency is to store your time/labour so that you can use it in the future.
How do you think bitcoin will ever cross this issue?
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:56:48
This type of logic is definitely starting to really ramp up. Buy buy buy and for no other reason than buy! I constantly see crazy advice being given about people sacrificing day to day necessities to buy bitcoin instead. Investing 101, only invest money you can afford to loose. The bitcoin mentality at the moment chasing the gains is you must invest everything because you can't afford not to. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:00:51
It's not acting as a currency that's why. Sure it meets some of the requirements but it's definitely acting and being perceived much more like a asset than a currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:41:53
That's such an arbitrary statement; how do you know if you are already there?
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:00:22
This is such bullshit. Why would any government support this. Currently in the fiat system if I have currency in the bank and it happens to earn a minisquil amount of interest, most likely less than inflation, I am forced to pay tax on it. To think that if you buy an asset like btc and it goes up by 10,000x the government is then going to allow you to liquidate that position tax free in small increments. Don't get me wrong, capital gains tax is the worst but I can't see them allowing you to profit tax free from btc. A more likely situation if the price continues to rise is the governments will start to notice how much money they can milk from btc in form of vats, gains taxes etc. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:02:11
The constant bitcoin forking is what i think makes bitcoin likely to be replaced. If bitcoin came out from day one with the current parameters to be a useful global means of account and never forked or deviated from the original mission than I think it's adoption would be alot larger already. It's hard to convince people this is the next big thing with this shit constantly going on. 
On a side note, op forgot the litecoin fork. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 06:35:20
Never said my life was on the line. The space interests me and i like to explore different lines of thinking outside my own through discussion. 
If i wanted to blindly follow the shepple i would be getting my investment advice straight off mainstream media in which case bitcoin has already died 100 times so why bother talking about it. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 04:16:36
yeah, i was generalising. 
Are you investted in bitcoin much?
@_date: 2013-03-20 23:49:24
I might be missing something but whats the relivance of those charts you posted?
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:16:07
I am more thinking of if this current up trend is sustainable in the immediate term.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:19:22
For sure. I have watched it for awhile missing massive gains but still not convinced on why the mainstream would use it as its insanely volatile and most people that own the coins wouldn't dare trade them as they think they will be worth millions soon. If everyone is buying and no one is selling.....doesn't make much sense as a currency
@_date: 2013-03-20 23:25:31
granted that version of the chart doesnt look as dramatic, but reguardless of how it charts. the concept of buying into something when its clearly having a run up doesn't make sense to me. I have always thought when the price is going up and steep thats when you time your exit and when its coming down thats when you get back in? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:57:31
Only confidence
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:17:29
Na was thinking if it got some serious network failures and successful large hacks. But otherwise governments could impose massive taxes on it as they did with precious metals. See how it goes, interesting time to be aware none the less 
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:48:56
Yeah that's what I have been thinking. If it survives
