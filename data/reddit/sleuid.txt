This is really a badly organised description of bitcoin. It's comparing the underlying technology of bitcoin with how pyramid schemes, but it's not really comparing what's important to the average 'investor'. 
* To the average investor there is a 'promise' or rather indication of returns - likelhood is that they're looking at bitcoin because the value increased by x%. 
* Whilst it's true the number of users doesn't influence the viability of bitcoin, it *can and will* influence the value of a bitcoin - so for a person's investments to go up you do need the people. 
* In Bitcoins case the original promoter is analagous to existing investors in bitcoin - bitcoin absolutely suffers from the issue of having anonymous investors who have a huge investment who could easily engage in market manipulation. For example, maybe that talking head on CNN is just trying to pump the price to dump his investment.
* Collapse. Again, everyone deserting bitcoin won't cause it to collapse, but it will result in the value of your investment to collapse.
* Long term members get their money out by selling it, they make a profit if demand has increased due to new investors.
I'm not going to go any further, but the point I'm making is to stop confusing the underlying technology of bitcoin with the current market value of bitcoins. To the average Joe Bloe they're interested in the actual investment in bitcoin rather than the underlying technology - because they're not buying the underlying technology.
