I'm going to go ahead and write you off as a troll because with all the shit going on in the world, I refuse to accept that someone as stupid as you is real. 
Edit: Yup, troll and a racist piece of shit to boot, haha, glad these losers are on the wrong end of this, not that there is anything that will stop their downward economic spiral into drugs and violence that will leave them in an even more disgusting societal shitpile than the people they hate. Except instead of sympathy, no one will give a fuck about you subhuman asshats. Rot in hell, we'll pay you enough to keep doing menial labor. Enjoy being the bitches of people who have empathy rather than a lizard's brain.

Arithmetic lesson time: Pretend the world is 1000 people (big numbers are hard for your little brain to contemplate). 5 people own some bitcoin. Another person buys bitcoin each week. 100 people are journalist econo-idiot types saying you should sell and that it's a bubble -- you believe them because you are a child that needs the government and pseudo-experts to walk you through life.


You are likely from a much lower socio-economic background than I am using terms like that, my friend ;)

You almost nabbed the upperhand my friend, but you let slip that you covet "elitist" values as well. 
It's like the racist Trump supporters that deep down are fragile snowflakes that want to be valued by society pretending they don't give a fuck. They imagine they are just uneducated, but really they're just the scum of the Earth.
Eat a bag of dicks you Bernie-bro douche canoe. You're not going to short bitcoin because even though you're an idiot (first prerequisite), you're also a coward -- you're just tawk, which makes you the elitist cockwad in this situation.

Bitcoin does not need to function effectively as a currency to be successful, it is more of a store of value that you can think of like digital gold. Gold is also terrible for day to day purchases. *Payment* systems are a separate thing than gold and we are in the very early stages, but payment systems are being built such as lightning network.
We had cash for a longtime... and only later did we get PayPal, Square, etc.
It doesn't matter what anyone *intended* regarding Bitcoin, it exists as its own entity, beholden to know one. It works because of monetary economics so all you need to be able to do is buy and hold it. Holding bitcoin *is using* bitcoin for what it is better at than anything else.
There are still tons of people who don't get this: people who have flooded this sub, people who were involved early but didn't understand what they were doing so sold or will sell at some price (laptop mining dogecoin in 2013 didn't teach me monetary economics). Plus, all the econo-idiots calling it a bubble when it is more like the pin to the ponzi-like system of government backed debt-laden money. Then you have the 99+% of people who only vaguely started hearing about bitcoin, but aren't buying any. You however asked a question and didn't get offended even when I was rude so you too can be part of that 1%, even if you're not part of the 0.001%.
It might go to zero, but so might the USD. Bitcoin is backed in solid math and threatens USD so I see it as a 50-50 shot. If I'm wrong, I lose what I put in, and keep working to make more money. If I'm right, it goes up 100x or so.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:28:39


Dude, you seem to have some serious anger issues and have trouble reconciling reality with your inability to grasp it. 
If you can lose all your money, you might be doing all right, but that means you either inherited it or are no longer useful to humanity. I could lose all my money and my net worth would keep going up, it's called building valuable companies.
You can now short bitcoin ya' piece of shit. You know you're full of shit or you would be shorting it -- so either you're an idiot for not shorting it or you're an idiot for your basic line of thinking -- I don't really care which it is.


I know exactly how stupid I sound, this is the internet, I don't need to make myself sound fancy. I'm not bragging about my socioeconomic status because you're far enough at the bottom that it's not a brag -- I thoroughly established your position by pointing out your use of the word "retarded" as a pejorative.

Everyone here thinks Bitcoin is at an all time high for some reason. It's actually more realistic to think of it as an all time low of the prices you will ever be able to buy it at.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:10:52
It certainly is. Richard Feynman said there is right, wrong, and *not even wrong*. You fall into the last category.
You're a lazy piece of shit, and the markets will punish your wilful ignorance. Fact is, btc going to zero, or to the moon, I will be happy with my decision and you will be wrong either way.
In the case it goes to zero, you will be gleeful for a moment and then go back to being a loser because you are not a genius, nor do you understand the nature of putting skin in the game to get ahead. This is not so for all people who are misguided, but how flippant you are fundamentally makes you a loser. Hey, but at least you don't have to work hard!

Lol, I was never measuring success by net worth, although the two are often correlated. 
Today you can live holding 100% in btc if you wanted, and transfer to USD just in time (there are even debit cards that do this). Not saying that's advisable, just that it's currently no more inconvenient than having only a credit card and no cash in your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:47:16
Lol, except everyone is calling it a bubble and saying sell and don't buy. Only small echo-chambers actually say to buy, which is why it is not too late. Buffett's quote assumes you're not a moron that can't figure this out.

This person is actually right. You can be a billionaire, but you don't really own any money until you cash out into the only real money we have, which is bitcoin. Until then your "billions" are just a government sanctioned number in a computer with questionable security.

With hyperbitcoinization prices could reach a few million per coin so the idea is either that will happen or somehow it will collapse to zero. If you buy before hyperbitcoinization any price is cheap -- and if it goes to zero you lose exactly the amount of money you put in. This is why if you decide to invest you should start buying right away. However, you can decide to allocated 30-50% of the capital you want initially, and then buy-in over time in case there is a dip or a small crash, this is called time-averaging.

Lol, I meant finance in general, I know *you* didn't come up with that term. If you ever built anything you would understand why the rest of the world laughs at you when you think your financial work is "technical". The math is trivial and the "engineering" is a circle jerk of your ego that doesn't get anything to happen in the world... if that's your thing, go for it. 
In this world economic illiteracy is a feature, not a bug. You're just confirming it's not too late to buy since the world is full of people like you -- guessing you've never heard of Nassim Taleb.
If you want to pretend you're a hotshot trader you need to do better to keep your story straight. You said you were certain that bitcoin would crash, but that you would short later because it's not a top. If you could call the top to short it, you would buy in now and sell before the crash. Time to cut your losses and go home.
Why are you even in this subreddit? Are you just trolling by pretending to be one of the half-intelligent fin-losers that will have to face a sad reality of their own uselessness if Bitcoin takes off and leaves them behind?

You're confusing absence of knowledge with a precise statement about probability. Given that you are too much of a fucking idiot to know that a coin flip has exactly a 50% probability of landing on a specified side, it's good that you have developed this heuristic since you certainly can't foresee the simplest of events unfolding if you can't follow a basic conversation.

I get wanting people to be friendly and everything, but that's not why I'm here. Honestly, I'm not an evangelist and I don't care about whether why or anyone else decides to adopt Bitcoin -- I don't care about "community".
I had someone tell me in 2010/2011 that I should look into Bitcoin because it's the sort of thing I'd find interesting. Too bad I didn't because I'm a lazy son of a bitch and I still am. Unlike then, I have a salary know and am fearful so I bought a tiny bit of Bitcoin a couple months ago.
I don't know how I missed it when everything seems so simple now. Maybe the privelege of being young and not having to worry about whether my rent and food were paid made me oblivious to to the world.
Anyway, be pissed off at me if you want, I'm not angry I'm passionate. You're on the right track. If I thought I could actually have an impact related to Bitcoin I might be nicer, but I know where my sphere of influence begins and ends so that's where I focus.
