*We can make them a thing again!*
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:31:16
And look at us now! Gox is still around, and *still* fucking things up.
Good times....

He likely knows. The hilarious thing is that joke is becoming a reality.
We're actually moving into a world where you can literally download a car. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:57:12
Pretty sure it applies to the folks with almost no or neg karma..I'd guess under maybe 50 comment, as even if you're not trying that doesn't take too long to reach. 
Just guessing, however.

Clearly the magic candidate that everyone keeps acting like exists when they throw fits about people not voting properly. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 20:33:16
Thaaaat's not how that works. At all. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 02:24:35
To occasionally laugh at the tin-foil hats who assume banker automatically means demon. 
Also because we're interested in a cryptocurrency, which doesn't mean agreeing with said tin-foils crackpot moments.

What are the other reasons? I've not seen any issues with them, but I can believe there might BE some...just none I've run across. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 07:00:17
..And...how dare companies...advertise.....
...Yeah, not really seeing the problem here beyond 'Stop doing what you want with your money and do what I want'. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 06:28:49
Except for the part where they're, you know, Crapware: The website now. 
Seriously, their old legacy is good but their modern incarnation is just...no man.

I know the Bloomberg guy made a lot of mistakes, but he gave the *private key away too?*
Does this guy hand his password to his email and his PIN out too or what? 
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:51:37
Now that I think about it, there was Ultrasabers..those were the only ones worse....Saberforge at least was fixable and *did* look good and fight good..once you did a little work.
Ultrasabers were just giant piles of crap.

This is like being scared because the doorman at your apartment knows when you go in and when you leave.

From a little research, Litecoin claims its better due to faster transactions, mining isn't as big a bitch, they also say better security.
I'm not sure either way..I could see them operating side by side, or maybe not....
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:27:19
hahaha, you know things from the internet, THUS I CAN NEVER HAVE YOUR FOOD AGAIN YOU DIRTY CASUALS!
That's what I'm getting from this....
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:39:55
That's the way I do it. There *may* be a way to pull funds from a different account, but I find the safest way would be to setup a mobile wallet, put a bit of money in there, and send the backup to your home device incase your phone dies/gets stolen/gets lost/etc. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:31:52
I missed that...why ARE they bad anyway. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:54:37
Translation. They're waiting to see if it stabalizes in a way they can profit.
If it does, yay!
If not, they still get a business boost because everyone thinks they're so modern and want's to support them then months down the road they just shrug smile and go 'Shucks'. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:50:21
Huh. I did a bit of searching and some folks whined they never got gear, or they got it six months to a year late which, by the time they got it, meant it wasn't profitable.
Doesn't matter to me..when/if coins rise back up I want Black Arrow equipment. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:48:08
I think you're OVER Estimating people....work in IT for a bit. You'll learn. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:28:27
Or maybe they saw a dangerous murderer on the TV and are trying to keep your fool head intact.
Seriously, while banks aren't the *greatest* things ever, not *everything* they do is malicious. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:10:38
Just get it on the front page of Reddit itself, they'll DDoS it by accident
@_date: 2013-12-15 13:43:06
..Why the hell does it all say 'I' and 'Me'. Is the company sentient, or what the hell am I missing here? 
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:14:52
Really now? Well that sounds pretty cool....I suppose I'd be willing to get my hands on at least one Saberforge saber than just to double check but if what you're saying is true, it'll make getting my hands on good quality ones a little easier as we won't have to custom make every single one....
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:30:20
Oh yeah, I should point that out. As a showpiece they're fucking beautiful...but unless you want to rebuild each one you get, well...unless there's been a jump in quality since two or three years ago, expect issues. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:31:30
Ahh. Yeah most folks if they're going to send coins are going to do it from a mobile wallet.
For example, I keep a very small amount of BTC on a Cellphone wallet that I'm intending to show to a few friends who questioned me about it a while back. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:15:25
...I really don't think I'd trust a one man outfit to be my ISP, the infrastructure requirements to properly supply..everything..just...
@_date: 2013-12-25 12:27:19
...Right, we...we talked..we hashed that out...we...I already know what he meant...he clarified...
@_date: 2013-12-15 13:45:40
Some people assume VPNs fix everything.
These people also assume you can track folks by writing a GUI in visual basic. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:17:38
Pretty sure it's not able to withdrawl..people can only *send* you stuff as it's the public key, and they have no access to the other credentials needed to do anything else. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:45:22
....Thaaaaat...doesn't sound right. Like..at all...
@_date: 2013-10-27 07:18:33
It was a Photoshop thread on SA, to be exact. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:24:32
While it's cool you guys are accepting Bitcoin, I don't think I'd buy a Saberforge saber. My old group used several, a mix of these, some other place and the hand builts for full speed, full contact fights.
These lasted longer only than the ForceFX some joker brought one day.
