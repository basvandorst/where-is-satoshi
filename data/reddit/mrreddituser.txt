Your title makes it seem like consecutive days

So what happens when it's not worth mining for miners anymore?

For such a large amount, and especially because they won't be using it actively, they should probably store it in a cold or hardware wallet.

Let's say sha-256 is broken at some point. Would that make the whole currency useless and everyone loses their money?

Yeah, that list is full of shit. Apple's app store doesn't accept Bitcoin

I think if it were yes, buy the time you got around to buying it would have already rose

Amazon doesn't accept Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-01-22 02:51:14
Why is that?
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:21:50
That's kind of how money works.

The network is also ready to unlimitedly scale, waiting on miners 
@_date: 2017-01-07 16:41:06
If you're not kidding, that sounds like a really dumb decision.

What are you farming?

Now let's increase the blocksize so transactions can actually happen!

A long time ago I heard about the concept of Proof of Stake, how is that doing? 
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:21:58
It works much like any other investment really. You could buy 50 mBTC today, and it might double in price tomorrow, or your investment could turn out to be worth half a cent in a month. It's probably considered a more risky investment than most of the mainstream stock market, so invest accordingly.

Everyone is an expert when it's a bear market
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:03:35
Worth celebrating though

In addition to not keeping Bitcoin on exchanges, don't keep an excess of fiat either!

What stops someone from sending the coins and selling them at an exchange twice from both chains then?
