A hardware wallet would be the most secure option. Mycelium or AirBitz are great mobile wallets. Avoid any wallet that doesn't give you full control over the private key to the wallet (ex. CoinBase)  Be sure to make a backup as well.  Your Bitcoin wallet contains all of the private keys necessary for spending your received transactions. If you delete your wallet without a backup, then you no longer have the authorization information necessary to claim your coins, and the coins associated with those keys are lost forever.

It isn't, you just have unreasonable expectations. Most people have a bank account/credit card or would be able to use local bitcoins.

You could deposit your prepaid card into a gambling/sportsbook that deals in bitcoin. Play around or do whatever you have to do to make the minimum cash out threshold and then cash out into bitcoin.

Really cool idea!! Too bad I'm in FL and the closest landmark is 1,000 miles away 😢

Well it's up $13 in the last hour after being relatively flat for almost 2 weeks. It will be interesting to see if this trend continues as the instability of the yaun continues

How so? If I purchase my BTC via CoinBase, then send them to my trezor  / mycelium wallet, how do they know what happens past that point?

Even the media are becoming mooners.
