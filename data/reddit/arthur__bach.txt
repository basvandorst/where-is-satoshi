Not sure why the insult. I own Bitcoin and continue to buy it regularly. I appreciate the advice, but lose the hostility. It will serve you better when you look at those who you reply to as human beings with a life in pursuit of happiness, health, and financial well being just as yours. 
Buy Enjin Coin.

Good for you for trying to make something happen in life. Looks good. Forget these loser comments. Those who can, do. Those who can’t criticize. Keep that in mind. When I was 22, I was broke as shit. I’m 32 now, and I’m doing alright for myself. This type of hustle is why some can retire at 35 based on their efforts. You’ll always have more negative comments than positive. When you post it, stay professional with the comments from assholes. You’ll do nothing but come off as a winner. You making the page is winning. You putting in effort is winning. Ignore the bullshit and keep doing what you do, man.

No problem, bro! Never let the negativity of of random internet strangers affect you positively or negatively! If you’re 22 and into cryptocurrency like this, you’ll be just fine. Live as cheap as possible. I think I do fairly well, but I don’t spend my money on much at all. Like like a student and keep doing this with cryptocurrency and you’ll be living a different life. Never give up. Michael Jordan-“I can accept failure, but I can’t accept not trying.” Hell of a lot more than I was messing around with at 22. Stay up!
