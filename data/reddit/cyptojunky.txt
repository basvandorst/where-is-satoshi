Well, nobody's asking you who should and who shouldn't be investing, don't they? Grow up, who should and who shouldn't be investing became a redundant issue - people WILL invest because thanks to crypto nobody can stop them, period.
And all this whining about FUD and who should be allowed to invest belongs to pre-crypto era. People will invest because nobody is stopping them. They will get burned. They will then understand the risks. They will then either continue to invest more wisely or will stop investing in crypto. The point is, it is out of the hands of governments or all kinds of "wise" financial advisors (who do not know shit about crypto dynamics just like the rest of us).
What really cracks me up is all these people who solemnly blame speculators and people affected by FUD for the dropping price of Bitcoin. Hahaha. We are ALL speculators because we ALL do not know shit - crypto is not well enough understood yet. So we are all playing in one giant casino. The good news is: transaction fees are low. So prudent people can start small and see how it goes. Which is one of the things that is great about crypto investment.

The story of your life heh? Just by the whining tone of your postI can tell that you lost a packet, dumbo. You had it coming.

Don't be so full of yourself. Go and sigh/fart elsewhere.

Well, this does not seem to be such a big problem to me. Easy to circumvent. So they can use Kraken and do a wire transfer from Kraken to any account worldwide. Or just keep the money on Kraken for the time being.

Isn't Binance a chinese exchange? Besides, I said - peopel will move to international exchanges, i did not say they cannot ban local exchanges - only it is futile

Yep this is probably the only choke point they have. Banks are trying to choke crypto. Take eg Transferwise - a great service for moving and exchanging money, and their borderless account is a great feature, but the underlying banks won't let Transferwise customers wire money to crypto exchanges. This will not last long - crypto investors (or i should rather say speculators) will always find a way!

No I am not missing anything. you are missing the question I asked. The answer is apparently: their stupid government CANNOT do anything, even if they wanted to. People who want to trade and invest in bitcoin will do so. That's what Tor and crypto exchanges worldwide are for. There are plenty of ways to withdraw fiat and I am sure there will be more with time. Their government is advised by bankers and bankers are stupid and also afraid that their ass will be fired which is what is going to happen to most of the bankers in the next 5 years because of cryptocoins. Once the dust will settle down, viable business models and applications for crypto will emerge and banks will become largely obsolete. Yahoooo!

You probably are not familiar with the mentalities of people in Southeast Asia. They will trickle though the cracks.

I hope you lost your dirty underwear. You seem to deserve it :)

That's what I think myself. Tired of all these people who responded to my simple question by whining about FUD and telling me to "read research". Morons :)

Yeah yeah
