This tether shadow could become really the biggest problem ever for Bitcoin. MtGox 2.0.....
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:10:13
Let’s talk about it, pm me
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:36:55
Just have a look to Sidera, they are releasing the first cryptowatch with crypto-to-fiat on-the-fly conversion!
@_date: 2017-02-12 11:04:14
That would be amazing ahahah!
@_date: 2017-02-12 17:15:01
BOC is the real name.. actually I don't understand why everybody calls it like that here.
@_date: 2017-02-13 03:46:50
Incredibile, thank you very much for the clarification! I live here in China and never saw the PBOC... I think that it's just the central authority printing money and regulating everything, because everybody here uses BOC, all of us have the account in BOC.

Price bottom hasn't adjusted since 72h, we are going margin called and we can't do nothing.

Seems unlikely, it would already came out. Somebody would have claimed the thing. Also they have the bitcoins as it is possible to buy them and even to withdraw in some cases (BTCC Pro Exchange). I think there is something else happening but I don't have any clue. Another explanation could be a major crackdown, something really big like a major shutdown.
@_date: 2017-01-12 09:39:47
They don't have the money to buy all the Bitcoins lol.
@_date: 2016-11-14 06:49:02
You will have a BTC wallet and debit card with fiat currency. You can freely exchange money between them, so from BTC to card changing in USD/EUR/GBP (depends what card do you have) and the other way round. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 04:55:29
Actually I think there is a bit of fear near the 6999 resistance. They are starting selling a few..
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:44:15
Oh and this is proof obviously: 
I'm curious about your couple of dollars you can afford so that you can elevate yourself like that.
@_date: 2016-11-07 14:57:29
I'm currently in China and localbitcoins doesn't have a PayPal option from here.
@_date: 2016-12-22 07:27:27
Thank you!
@_date: 2016-11-18 03:40:37
Got it! Thank you for the clear explanation!
@_date: 2016-11-28 18:46:53
@_date: 2016-12-21 07:57:22
Is there any ETA for BitCache? I know the expected release date is in January, did they say something more precise?
@_date: 2016-11-15 14:43:04
Reliable and fast, will do business again!
@_date: 2016-11-18 01:50:04
I have a question regarding bread iOS app. Assuming obviously that I have the phrase of the wallet. If I loose the phone or I delete the app how can I recover the wallet? Only from the same app or can I do it with a PC? Thank you.

Probably a scam.. it's very difficult to buy BTC with paypal. The best way is using Virwox.
@_date: 2016-12-27 10:25:35
In these years I started buying BTC with Virwox because it's quite easy (there are high fees though). Other options are localbitcoins. Pretty easy.
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:33:34
My god...
@_date: 2016-12-09 13:25:30
China is laughing out loud
@_date: 2016-11-14 04:40:17
Hello, I'm currently a Wirex user. I activated the account and received the plastic card. The app is very nice and is so easy and fast to purchase bitcoin. You feel as you have a dual currency card: BTC/EUR for example. You can load your card from BTC in less than 10 seconds and vice-versa. It's not so easy to transfer fiat money though, you can attach it to PayPal and load it from there. I don't know if you can wire transfer. Since I started using it I only loaded BTC so I can't give you other feedback.

I trade in China. Currently I'm using Breadwallet on my iPhone and do trading with BTCC.
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:12:24
True, just finished my light lunch! (Living in Beijing lol)
@_date: 2016-12-28 10:58:29
How to read this chart? Is it good?
@_date: 2016-12-04 05:53:11
Personally I would prefer .btc extension because it's shorter.
@_date: 2016-11-24 01:49:10
Well then they should not advertise Bitcoins on their platform as an anonymous private currency, as in their case clearly is not like that. They are exaggerating, I think that storing personal documents, require a selfie holding the ID, mobile confirmation, email, personal address is quite enough. What will be the next step? Bring them my mother? 
@_date: 2016-12-28 11:19:32
Is 1163$ the ATH in all history of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-12-20 03:30:47
Bad as PayPal

I recommend the one from Princeton University, there is also a free course on Coursera which follows the contents of the book. 
Here the link to the book on Princeton's website:

So anyway I will be always able to recover the wallet with the app?
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:33:58
A paper wallet

I'm Italian. The title is completely wrong, we didn't vote for leaving or remaining in Europe and the possibility of an Italexit was used by the PM in order to move votes in his favor. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 12:23:52
4 am in China is 12 pm in Los Angeles
@_date: 2016-12-27 15:11:31
Yes it is, I live here and now it's 11 pm, it's late and we are going to sleep. In addition major bank's transfers like Bank Of China are closed between 9 pm and 4 am. I think that early tomorrow morning there will be a big pump.
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:48:41
Yes true.
@_date: 2016-11-24 00:19:20
These requirements are slowing Bitcoin adoption. It's contradictory to have a currency which guarantees the privacy of the user and then I am required to pass through all of this.  Documents, questions, etc etc are de-anonymizing and contra-privacy.
@_date: 2016-11-21 04:47:39
That was clear, thank you all.
@_date: 2016-12-31 10:46:11
Honestly I don't think that Satoshi is a single person. It's nice to imagine "him" like a super geek or hobbyist but I think there is an organization behind Bitcoins. Such a complex system... too complex for one mind behind. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 06:23:18
So because of the Italian vote the price is going down? I don't get it... 
@_date: 2016-12-26 14:15:54
This is a nice gift: 
@_date: 2016-12-27 08:14:22
Download and install the BTCC mobile app (from their site) and if you tap on the CNY price it changes to USD.
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:33:07
6BTC and I have another 6. Why are you talking like that to me if you don't know nothing? Fucking idiot..
@_date: 2016-10-29 14:32:35
Coinbase is the bitcoin PayPal.
@_date: 2016-10-29 16:04:16
Paypal is known for freezing accounts without any explanation. It's a pain in the ass, there are merchants that can not use funds for months.
