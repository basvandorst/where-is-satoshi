You are completely off target. By controlling it I mean getting paid for the transactions. If people start using bitcoin credit instead of banks they lose revenue.

The mainstream financial community is terrified of a financial instrument that they don't control.

Replace the word 'bitcoin' with any other currency on the planet and what you are saying is still true. Bitcoin does not have value other than the faith of those using it. Unfortunately bitcoin purchasing is a bubble that will burst like the housing market. Those thinking it is their retirement vehicle are fools.

Gold will still exist when there is no electricity...

Large portions of the planet don't have reliable electricity, and the existing grids are man-made and VERY fragile, even in the US.  You depend on a service that has not been reliable except in a handful of places on the planet in the last 50 years. 
I like bitcoin, but it is not a real currency in all situations yet. Maybe someday, but bitcoin cannot predict infrastructure issues.

That is ridiculous. All the major investors who matter are turning to gold right now. 
Bitcoin is as volatile as any currency, more so because of its dependence on tech.

The person who wrote this is a fool. If there is a major financial crash bitcoin will fall like all other currency.

This is stupid. No one is going to try and guess your bitcoin key.
They will steal your personal credentials so they can break into your wallet and will not need your bitcoin key.

Wake up. Government is necessary.

You are a fool who understands nothing.  That is all I have to say.

Bubbles indicate an anomaly in the economy. Its called a bubble because the pressure inside the bubble is not sustainable - eventually it has to normalize. 
Bubbles in the economy are typically negative - I don't know if an economic bubble can be positive in the end. Would like to know about one if they have happened.
