Yes you should sell it all and never buy again. \s

Yea, was referring  to the Petrol fee which is 7%. It's probably easier to buy at Petrol though as there are way more Petrol gas stations around as LON atm machines. The 3% difference probably evens out as gas money when you are driving to the only LON atm in town, instead of going to the nearby Petrol :)

It doesn't say anywhere that you must have an account, but I am assuming that you don't have to because it's a very small bank, actually the first time I've heard of is right now. They only have 1 ATM in the capital and around 15 over the country. The process is the same as on the Petrol gas station around Slovenia. You put the money in, pay the 7% fee and get a coupon with a code that you later input into the website bitins.net and they send you coins to your wallet.

Yes you can, but only for amounts of 20, 50, 100 and 200€.

Well I guess that is the second way you can buy it. But you can definetly buy it in a coupon kind of way that I have said. Tbh I haven't bought BTC on Petrol yet, but I checked the Petrol/Bitins website to see the instructions. You can see the BTC coupon [here.](

In my country, whenever bitcoin hits the news people are saying it is Illuminati's work.
