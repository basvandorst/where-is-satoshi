Does anyone know what exactly happened around those blocks that caused such a sharp drop in Segwit use?

This might sound crazy. Like really crazy. But does anyone else notice that they use red for the Bitcoin charts and green for the Bcash charts on coinbase? A place where small marketing techniques to the average consumer would matter? Adding this to the sudden Bcash support....showing price  while they "wait for liquidity" to start trading....

What governing body would change this? Lets say a group got together like for SegWit2x and it got passed. What would be the "change" that would be implemented? I guess that is a very broad question, but it just feels strange that something decentralized can be voted on and changed by a central entity.

okay, so lets say segwit2x happened and it was more popular than bitcoin core. Would we have two coins (segwit2x and core), cores price would be driven to zero and then our segwit2x coins would be the new standard?

The only reasoning behind touching Satoshi’s coins is that while these coins are assumed to be “lost”, what happens if a single entity IS still in possession of them? If these coins were seen to move at all from their current location, I would assume for it to be a bad day in the Bitcoin world. However I do agree they shouldn’t be distributed equally...maybe locked instead...

this is just a hypothetical situation to help me understand how future changes to bitcoin would be processed
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:04:51
but my question is can bitcoin core somehow update this or is that impossible?

Futures are upwards of $1000 now. Not sure what you mean by “legit”. People feel it isn’t legit because they are “stealing” Satoshi’s coins as well as have 2 mil coins pre mined.

Segwit2x on the 28th

Do you link your bitcoin to a different wallet such as blockchain.info in order to lower the fees? I want to do all my business within Electrum but there is no way I am going to deal with a fixed fee every time.

I guess I’ll look up and learn about the mempool, thanks! So am i wrong in thinking that every miner is figuring out the “answer” to the same SHA256 hash? Like every miner has the same list of transactions that will potentially be the next block right?
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:05:55
Random question. I’m understanding more and more about the ledger and how blocks are verified with proof of work. The only thing i don’t understand is how every group picks the same transactions to verify. Like, for instance, why don’t they only verify the ones with the highest “tips” associated with them? How to transactions with no “tips” get chosen? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:09:15
So how does every single miner choose the same transactions to add to the ledger? Or is there a single ledger in which miners add to? I guess I’m confused because i thought each “miner” was competing to find the “answer” to the SHA256 question that was being asked of the ENTIRE ledger. If that is the case, then each copy of the ledger that they are all trying to solve would have to be the same, yes?

I’ll take a look after work. Thanks for the help to the both of you!!

Where? I’ve been trying to find them but it’s just a bunch of people flipping them for 1400
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:51:06
This was the explanation i was looking for. Just one more question in regards to this. So there are multiple blocks being mined at once? There isn’t a single block being mined and everyone is racing to finish that one first? If so, that makes a lot more sense in my mind. I thought it was a constant race to mine the same block.
But shit...then that makes me wonder. If different groups of miners are mining different blocks, isn’t it possible that three blocks get solved one after another, therefore breaking the “one block every 10 minute” rule? Sorry for all the questions

im watching now, thanks!

Every time i feel like I’m understanding it, i get more confused. It was my understanding that a block gets filled to its top with transactions. Then, once it’s full, miners try to find what they need to to match the hash target. I’m wrong, but how far off am i? I’m trying to have a basic understanding but it seems like going into the weeds is necessary to get a decent understanding.
