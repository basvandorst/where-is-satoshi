GPS proof of 200mph or bullshit.

This announcement seems to set the stage for further delays.
Why can't you test firmware without a case?  
What machine shop is incapable of of adjusting the CNC code in a reasonable amount of time after the 1'st prototype unit is milled and fit-tested.

While I haven't had that particular problem, I do often receive the, "cold-storage wallet maintenance try again in 6 hours" quite often. 
Though since they are no longer doing ACH transfers, the $20 money order list is backlogged, "virtual office" presence, lack of an explanation of  the user info leak, and the frequent BTC withdrawal issues are eerily reminiscent of events that mtgox is currently putting everyone through.

If only there was a site in which you could exchange bitcoins locally with other hobbyists.  It could be called something like [localbitcoins.com](

possibly, but it doesn't implicate satoshidice as having been exploited or an actor in the current situation.

godspeed to your colon.

I'm not tempting you, I'm calling you out.  Neither the car nor the motorcycle pictured can touch 200mph on flatland.

the problem today is the lack of liquidity, 5 months ago it was unsustainable growth/lack of staffing.

I can't even bring myself to watch the content of the video with Jeffrey Tucker is acting like a 13-year old girl over Charlie Shrem.

have you actually bought toilet paper? Double ply toilet paper is $.5-$1/roll.

I'm curious by the way the addresses were aggregated.  It seems many paperwallets, physical coins, and satoshidice addresses were collected together.

Be sure to let us know how the demands end up turning out.

nah, this is where legitimate gun stores buy inventory for retail sale at significantly below market value.

A prototype not only tests the design but the tooling, production methods, and material selection.
How was the entire batch completed before someone caught the "finish" problem? 
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:01:00
Could you please link a few of the instances for reference?
The fact that it has occurred cannot be ignored, there has to be a cause.

General contractors and the senate work on the same schedule... It's going to take at least twice as long and cost at least twice as much as originally anticipated.
