Gee thanks.


Nobody is imposing a specification on you prior to running a Bitcoin node, nor is anyone forcing you to adhere to any specification. You are merely choosing to run code you feel is sensible to run. That is all. This basic attribute of software applies to both PoW and PoS and is certainly not limited to Bitcoin as you explicitly say.


Yes. But not for the reasons you state.


You validate this in either case. This isn't relevant at all.
You've misunderstood what it is I said completely. In a PoW system you can make objective judgements about what happened in the past, because a PoW blockchain relies on external factors (production of 'work') in order to function, whereas all judgements you can make about a PoS blockchain are subjective, because PoS blockchains do not have external factors to rely on.
This works better if you are a miner, because presumably you can make these judgements more confidently.


This isn't ambient knowledge, this is aprioristic knowledge.


You've omitted context. As I said there are things beyond 'nothing' that Core software takes advantage of.


PoW is also resistant for the reasons I state. PoS is resistant because added assumptions. Admittedly both means of mitigation introduce an assumption.
Ripple is out of scope.

 should help you out.
Some pointers:
- Miners don't collaboratively mine: each 'hash' has no relation to any other hash, other than that each are unique.
- Miners in the same pool don't communicate with one another to the benefit of mining, all they need in order to mine is the previous block's hash to mine on top of. They communicate 'shares', which are proofs of work that are insufficient, and the pool uses as a gauge to determining how much to reward each miner.
- Each miner is hashing 80 bytes worth of block header. 4 bytes version, 32 bytes prevblock, 32 bytes merkle root (a hash of all transactions), 4 bytes unix unsigned timestamp, 4 bytes diff bits, 4 bytes nonce.
- Your miner increments the nonce until its value saturates, then it changes some things in the transaction set (typically a number in the coinbase transaction) which changes the merkle root, and then resets the nonce and restarts. (alternatively it has some bits in the timestamp to play with)
- (Stratum) pool mining is a bit different: the individual miner does not validate transactions, or compose the transaction set it is mining. But it has some control over some bits in the coinbase transaction.
Any further questions/unclarities, don't hesitate to ask.

Markets are a funny thing; participants' individual demand curves are non-deterministic and, more often than not, not entirely rational - completely subjective. These things are impossible to predict.
Though it stands to reason that the price of the commodity in question would drop by a fair bit, if, all other things being equal, its supply doubled.

It's quadratic complexity of the initial sync assuming linear blockchain size growth (which is conservative, given that demand is already filling up blocks to the current maximum and methods are being devised to cram more stuff to validate into it as much space. ie. segwit, schnorr and signature aggregation).


Evidently not, though. I strongly doubt controversial hard forks are possible in Bitcoin in the first place - so in order for this easily arranged schedule to work at all, the contention needs to be done away with first, which I don't see happening in the light of things like segwit operating on the same timetable.


BU-like solutions where various constants are made into settings, however, are hardly a sound means of perceiving to have this choice 'in the hands of users': what this is doing is introduce consensus incompatibility across the network. I'd think the ETH/ETC precedent would be enough of a deterrent to keep this type of thing from happening in the short term. But perhaps not.
That said. I, too, would like the decision of what strain the network is imposing on itself in terms of validation to be in the hands of users. Effectively, that's where it is today; the network is overwhelmingly in consensus on the 1MB block size limit.
But, of course, I acknowledge there are various users wanting more, even in the face of fact pointing to the non-rationality in choosing to want that. I'm sure myself and many more would happily explain to them how and why that is unwise and will not happen under current or given conditions through civil discourse, but at some point I feel these users (given what I've seen happen in the past year) can just be ignored and left unhappy, because they do not appear to be ever satisfied.

The function and merits of money being fungible aren't a matter of debate.


US currency is legal tender, it is fungible and will be readily substituted by, if nothing else, the US government.
Considering there can never be a law that can make bitcoins fungible, because there can never be an authority that can guarantee its equal substitution, bitcoins must be made fungible through technology. That is, doing away with all factors that allow one 'bit of bitcoin' to be distinguished from another.

Fees are typically chosen based on the transaction size, in bytes. If the transaction in question is comprised of many inputs (making the transaction's bytesize higher), the fee required to have it be mined into a block within a reasonable timeframe may be quite high.

So, _I guess (?)_, that means by disclosing a transaction (which in MimbleWimble is 'morphed'/sorta-invisibility-cloaked) and some mimblywimbly sort of UTXO proof, you can prove a specific TX happened (/ was involved in a 'merger'). Which means the size of this proof is little more than the tx size. However there's range proofs in here, so this tx size will be ~&gt;2k.
But I'm still miles away from wrapping my head around this thing, so don't take my word for it.

The nonce is only 4 bytes long, which means there are 2^32 (4294967296) possible values for this field. A typical miner hashes all possible values for the nonce field multiple times per second, 'saturating' the field.
Ie. the Antminer S9 does 14 TH/s, for example, which is 14 * 10^12 hashes per second, or 14000000000000 hashes per second.
    14000000000000
        4294967296 /
    ==============
            ~ 3259
^(* real multiplier value varies because miners can also flip bits in the timestamp)
So the miner needs a new/fresh header (or more accurately only its merkle root, by flipping a bit in one of the transactions) to hash through roughly 3000 times per second.

It isn't absurd at all.
It would be quite rational for BFX to bribe all miners (through conditional OP_CSV fee burns, or regular timelocking) to do a rollback, and it would be quite rational for all miners to be swayed by their doing that, and it would be sensible for all users to consider this a possibility because this is simply what a PoW consensus system allows.
This rollback can still happen until the block reward outweighs the value stolen in the hack.
Indeed this is something we will have to deal with in the future as the block reward decreases further. (By that I mean mitigatory practices, because clearly this is an undesirable property)

Yep. It's very unfortunate that this is happening. But P2SH is just the 'encoding' of an arbitrary redeemscript into a hash.


Only because, in practice, multisig is the most used application.


Everything that is non-standard in Bitcoin, is standard for P2SH. P2SH will be used for pretty much *every* future application in Bitcoin. If we could rewrite Bitcoin today, then P2SH would be the sole transaction type in the network.
P2SH has better privacy, it is the most compact in the UTXO set, it is the most secure.
P2SH will run Lighting, and it will run all future smart contract top-layered systems.

P2SH isn't by definition larger than any other transaction. The primary application for P2SH today is multisig, which typically takes some number of signatures. Multisig is just one way of using P2SH.
Segwit-style P2SH transactions aren't necessarily multisig (though many of them will be). In any case, there's gonna be savings in the scriptsig for any segwit spends.
Research the meaning of P2SH more to better understand why.

Yes - assuming the connection is over clear-net and not TOR. However, this node presumably would not know it is the first node, and typically would not be able to distinguish 'your' transaction from any other transaction a node is relaying.
That said, this is a privacy leak. A willing adversary could connect many sybils to your node, partially eclipsing you, and trivially derive which transactions are yours, and which are being relayed.
Best privacy practice would be to _never_ broadcast your own transactions through your own node (except for TOR), and instead use some mixing network / messaging service, or a 3rd party broadcaster that does it for you.

But they *are* double spends.
A bug produces faults, the malleability problem produces no faults.
A malleability-related bug might exist in vendor software wherein an (for now) incorrect assumption is made that the txid is immalleable; this vendor software should use all of the transaction excluding the scriptsig to refer to a transaction, rather than the protocol mandated txid.
Alternatively, the malleability problem causes certain smart contract constructs to be unfeasible as a use case if one transactions' inputs builds on another transaction's outputs while that transaction hasn't yet confirmed.
But that doesn't make malleability a bug. It is an undesirable feature at best.

I would suggest you observe the actual workings of the network rather than iterate what is claimed in the white paper. The white paper makes some unfortunate implicit assumptions that are no longer true - namely that majority hash power is represented by the economic majority. In reality, consensus is determined by the latter - not the former. The white paper wrongly assumes both are one and the same, which I think is at the root of all this confusion.
The economic majority today is represented by economically dependent fully validating auditors of the Bitcoin blockchain. And to make matters worse, there is not even a metric to measure these participants.

That's the merkle root commitment of the witness merkle tree. Not the witness bit of the transaction.
The current scriptsig as we know it is left empty in segwit (well ... not so for P2SH -- but that's another story). The actual witness is moved outside the block (as we know it), and referred/committed to through the merkle tree commitment in the coinbase.
The witness propagates through the p2p network sort-of as usual (except for legacy nodes) - but serialized differently.
OP_RETURN has nothing to do with segwit. OP_RETURN is a Script opcode used in practice by individuals to embed arbitrary data or commitments. It isn't some inherent thing we can use to sneak data into without anyone batting an eye like we do with segwit.

Compiling software and reviewing code is literally impossible, apparently. A fundamental downside of the Bitcoin trust model indeed. =/ /s


Unlike PoS, in a PoW system you _can_ test for this, because you can make an objective presumption about the work required to practically secure a valid chain. Especially if you are a miner (by making assumptions about your own profitability and projected others').


The Core node software is very adept at making sure it isn't being eclipsed, and provides the user with various ways of further mitigating this vector (such as manually connecting to a trusted/known peer or seed node, connecting over TOR, and soon BIP151 encryption / authentication). Being connected to an honest network isn't an assumption at all.
In any case, neither of the weaknesses are specific to Bitcoin or PoW.


That is blatantly false and insulting.


That is ridiculous. User can review software.


That only holds if [A] holds, which it doesn't.


That is a result if [A] holds, which it doesn't.


That is perhaps the only trueism in your entire quest for justice; PoS chains break down in this case, making network-level attacks a fruitless effort, whereas PoW chains remain functioning at (visibly) lower capacity (and at great cost to the attacker).
However, this entire vector (which applies only to the network-level; not to the objective blockchain history / bootstrapping phase) may be fully eliminated (if you want to, which you shouldn't) by adopting the PoS assumption of connecting to (and authenticating with) honest peers (and this is already present, albeit in an ugly way; the alert mechanism), or sufficiently mitigated by having the node shut down in case of extreme PoW hashrate changes (which is also present; safe mode).

This just shows a lack of understanding of the Bitcoin consensus mechanism. The 'rules' are set by economic participants enforcing some set of rules - miners are merely paid participants that provide security by introducing an ever-increasing cost to attack the network.
Miners could form a cabal and change, add or remove any number of 'consensus' rules - it would mean precisely nothing so long as the economic participants of the network do not observe that same ruleset.
@_date: 2016-04-29 12:29:57


No existing service / application is impacted






Yes. But they will not *become* more expensive: they *are* more expensive (the discounted portion / witness can immediately be pruned after validation, which can only be easily/optimally done for segwit transactions, for example).


Bear in mind there is no such thing as a transaction *fee* constant in any consensus code. The 'discount' pertains to the *size*, in bytes, of a transaction's witness in relation to the block it resides in.
However - decreasing this *size* discount will be a soft fork, increasing it will be a hard fork (though there's plenty of ways to make that a soft fork aswell).


There will be an incentive to take advantage of the size discount as it will likely decrease the fee (note, there is no added rule strictly imposing this decrease in fee)
There are no negative effects other than those of incurring higher-than-needed cost in *not* taking advantage of segregated witness. The alternative to not adopting segwit, is the *guarantee* of incurring these high costs.
To illustrate the reason for this discount: By adopting a segwit transaction scheme in your application / usage of the Bitcoin network, you can pay the fee you would normally pay for current transactions, and have your transactions propagate through the network with 4 times as much priority as usual.
EDIT: (Thanks for the replies so far I have added a couple more)


Witness size discount*
1. It provides an incentive for individuals, wallets, exchanges and merchants to upgrade to this optimised transaction structure.
2. It allows the network to increase the block size limit through a soft fork.

Not all economically dependent auditors of the blockchain are miners - most aren't, and by some definitions none are. Learn to science.
What you're saying is that miners - when in agreement - can do anything they like, which is demonstrably false. They can collude all they want; so long as I run my node and depend on it economically, my coins are not effected. To me and my node, it's the miners that are living on their own network.

No, the demand for real-world resources _is_ the desirable property of SHA256 proof-of-work or any other such algorithm.


Such type of transactions are widely considered an anti-feature; Bitcoin transactions are irreversable.
If there is ever an ability for your transaction to be reversed at your sole discretion, then there is no reason for your counterparty to have accepted this transaction as payment other than by trusting you, in which case he might as well have just asked for payment at a later date, which is functionally equivalent. Reversible transactions do not make sense in Bitcoin.

Well, today miners manage to collide about 70 of the 256 bits of a double sha256 every 10 minutes, and it's taken 6 years of highly competitive and highly profitable ASIC production to do that. To collide P2SH they'd need to pile RIPE-MD on top of that, and they'd still be 90 bits short. Each extra bit doubles the effort required to pull it off.

Each (1-)address can be accessed by around 2^96 different private keys. So yes it is possible that different keys can access the same address, simply because the address is 160 bits and the private key is 256 bits.
Ignoring P2SH, this applies to the simple P2PKH structure (1-addresses).
The probability of collisions is still extraordinarily small because even a 160 bit address space is ridiculously large. Also see 
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:29:33
Yes. There's an infinite number of strings that collide with a 160 bit ripemd(sha256()) hash; barring pushdata restrictions, there may exist an infinite number of scriptsigs that will yield the correct p2sh hash.
However, given that there are pushdata restrictions, the number of collisions out there is finite, but much higher than p2pkh's 2^96. Still, the search space in this case is much higher than 2^256. Further, the scriptsig must also be valid, although I suppose one might construct a script that is always valid, and contains garbage data that is OP_DROP'ed, or something similar - the garbage could then be used to collide (assuming that is trivial, which it's very much not).

The blockchain that the network considers Bitcoin is the chain which has the highest amount of cumulative work in it, which is also valid.
Each block is attributed a certain quantity of 'work' units. Low difficulty blocks represent little work, high difficulty blocks represent a lot of work. It is irrelevant what the distribution of high difficulty or low difficulty blocks attacker's chain looks like. All that matters it that the resultant chain be of higher cumulative work than the present Bitcoin's chain. That is, the attacker's chain needs to have &gt; ~1.4x10^26 dsha256 hashes represent its proof of work chain, and that is all that matters.

This is called spy mining, or SPV mining. It's what miners mine when they know there's a new best block through another miner's stratum endpoint, but they haven't validated that block yet (and as such cannot include any transactions as there will likely be conflicts).
They do this purely to get the block subsidy of 12.5BTC at the expense of network capacity.

Nodes being operated out of altruism is a widely perpetuated misconception: a node offers its owner unique security, privacy and certainty over the integrity of the blockchain. Anyone with economic stake in this network would do well to run a node in order to secure it - not to 'contribute back' to the network, but to have certainty that his/her ownership of these craved coins is actually real.
Subsidising nodes for the sole purpose of running them would be misguided. (paying for SPV services and such, on the other hand, is a very viable alternative that is actually feasible)

Aswell as the conference's stated intentions:




@_date: 2015-12-22 09:30:33
They are validating *all* transactions, they are just unaware of the segwit addition to the rules. As far as their own assumptions on their own transactions go, they are only minimally effected, validating their own (old style and fully compatible) transaction will be as indicative the transaction is correct as it would be today with some notable edge exceptions:
- They cannot distinguish a chainsplit where (some of) the hashing power has changed its mind (reversal of a soft fork they are unaware of)
- They cannot distinguish a valid segwit tx from an invalid one
These can only be abused with significant miner power, and would be swiftly detected by the network at large.
While it is certainly advisable to upgrade into a soft fork, not doing so does not significantly reduce any security assumptions.
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:20:05
As I said.
Readjustment is every 2016 blocks, though, which under a static hashrate equates to 14 days. Also note that it's *blocks* that are the basis for readjustment, not time - meaning if the hashrate is significantly higher than the previous difficulty window, the readjustment will be made much sooner.
@_date: 2015-12-14 13:11:16
The Bitcoin network doesn't have a firm grip on time: we could never agree whether it's been exactly (or even roughly) 10 minutes since the last block was found.

Even more hilarious then.
Would you agree that in any one voluntary exchange, two people walk away happier than they were before. And would you agree individuals choose means for the attainment of ends.
If so, what is pretty obvious is that in a free market economy, individuals choose the highest quality product for the lowest preferred price, and other individuals compete with yet more individuals to work in providing this.
The driving force behind these interactions is the prospect of profit. You mention the people in this non-profit organisation do their work for the satisfaction of providing quality service to consumers; I believe very few of these organisations exist (volunteering in developing nations abroad comes to mind), but that is also profit. What is non-profit are things like government services or services that exist through subsidy. They have no incentive to provide quality service whatever; their incentive is in securing their means of funding.
Other things that provide low quality service, are organisations held together by government assured monopoly, which is what we're dealing with with this whole net neutrality debacle.
It isn't a profit motive that is driving the quality of service down, a profit motive does the opposite when applied in a free market. If quality is what you desire, a legitimate course of action to pursue is of an entrepreneurial nature, or to demolish barriers that prevent such action to happen.

Then there's the problem where miners' opinions are meaningless if the economic majority's opinions don't match up. Which proposal, if any, will be deployed is by no means decided by miners.
I would be strongly in favor of what you're proposing if it were local node policies users were selecting, (which to some degree, they already can) rather than consensus rulesets.
What consensus altering proposal to adopt throughout the entirety of the network will *have* to be decided on through some other mechanism.

The signatures aren't being forgotten (well - they can be pruned, but only after having validated them). They are just being moved from the place they are currently annoying everyone (inside the transaction) to another place where they are comfortably out of sight, out of mind, but still inside the system.
Every (upgraded) participant will still be validating the witnesses in order to determine whether or not a block is valid; the security model is the exact same.

That is true from the technical perspective.

Would you think this network would opt to fix the problem, and continue on the old chain? Or reorganise as the protocol prescribes and keep on going?

Hardly. A 75% *mining* majority holding a staggering 25% hostage until a switch-over is not in the spirit of Bitcoin.
Also, a *mining* majority is a far cry away from an economic majority. The *economic* (super)majority is the group that can add economic incentive to a hard fork switch-over, not the miners. Using a miner vote as the sole metric for a switch-over, especially when we're talking about a controversial/contentious hard fork, is extremely poorly thought of - deploying such a scheme with ongoing contention is downright irresponsible.

Aah, ok.


XT and Core (and all other implementations) currently all live on the same network and blockchain.
XT (specifically) being called an altcoin is (currently) only its strictly technical nomenclature because it explicitly and knowingly employs a different consensus ruleset. However, this altered consensus ruleset has not yet triggered and activated (and likely never will), and, as a result, it lives on the same network and blockchain.
Your coins are proper bitcoin coins.
BIP 101 under XT activates 2 weeks following the moment when 75% of miners signify they support this proposal in the last 1000 blocks. Currently, 0.1% has signified support - and it doesn't look like there will be many more.
However, I was under the impression Coinbase only tested BIP 101 under the hood - not that they actually switched their full nodes to XT. If they have, then that is probably the most irresponsible move of a major Bitcoin company since Gox.

It requires (at least) consensus among miners to enforce the newly added rule.
For the soft fork to stick (be made irreversible except by hard-forking out of it), it needs consensus among the entirety of the ecosystem aswell. A soft fork does not reduce the necessity to update your node.
So, they *do* require consensus, but they can be deployed using only miner consensus, making it much easier, and it's something we have intimate experience with (hard forks, not so much - yet). Old nodes will keep on doing their thing, whereas in the hard-fork case they will, effectively, be expelled from the network.
Hard forks require complete consensus from the moment they are activated, which is why presumably it will be better when such a roll-out is well coordinated, well in advance, and very, very well communicated *eco-system wide*.

That isn't really a practical attack vector.
Your single connection could simply withhold information from you and leave you in the dark, aswell as filter/block your broadcasts.
It can also isolate you from the network, by not disclosing to you its connected peers - or only provide compromised ones.
It will also know each and every one of your transactions, and might derive your location - even through spending habits alone.
There's a reason a node continually rotates between connections and swiftly moves through the network topology. Information is valuable - disclosing everything to a single entity is not a policy that can even pretend to preserve anonymity.

Digital signatures involve R, a random 256-bit value, which you'd have to make public aswell if you want to identically replicate the signature.
Admittedly, you could just SHA256(privkey) and use that for R, but you can't enforce this / make it standard.
You would also have to filter out any spend to a spent address through a soft fork.
Also, the 'privkey' commitment needs to be proven somehow, which would include another signature (and another, and another).

When we're talking about stake-voting on the ideal block size limit specifically, then yes, I think that is a problem; those who are more wealthy presumably have less of a problem with higher block sizes, which would lead to the exclusion of those who are less wealthy. This, unfortunately, creates a feedback loop that could lead to higher and higher block sizes to the point where the system is forced centralise, which is something I think nobody wants to end up at.


Absolutely, but this abstract concept - as I interpret it - pertains more to economic activity and productivity, than it does to coin ownership.

Let's not bog this discussion down into a public schooling debate. It's about Bitcoin.
Bitcoin, as it exists today, is pretty much inclusionary to everyone. If "those who hold the gold" are given the power to effectively exclude "those who do not hold that ton of gold, but are included nonetheless", from participating, then I would say it's pretty clear that isn't great.
For example, let's say I'm pretty well off, and I can be sure that I can continue to validate everything under worst case BIP 101 (full blocks always) indefinitely at a cost that I think is reasonable for my situation. Would that make it right for me to be able to use my "well off" amount of coin to vote and exclude those who cannot, from validating fully? I think not.

The technical difference between a hard forked and a soft forked SW turns out to actually be pretty trivial, while the advantages are the same; if the soft fork is 'ugly', then so is the hard fork. (and neither are ugly)
The primary difference is the location of the witness  commitment. It's either a branch in the merkle root (hard fork), or in one of the transactions (first/coinbase, or last - currently looking to be in the first).
Considering the merkle root has new structure in the hard fork, and identical structure in the soft fork, one could argue the soft fork is actually the prettier solution.
Personally I'm fine with either; the burden of adapting software is not mine, and I want the advantages SW gives either way, so, whatever. But considering the hard fork requires a large portion of an ecosystem to add complexity they would otherwise not have to, the soft fork alternative seems much more desirable.
Regardless of anything: if the difference is negligible, and the 'ideal' route boils down to preference *only*, then the soft fork is the correct route to take.

A signature check involves hashing the entire transaction for one input. Linearly increasing inputs, makes for quadratic blowup right there.
If a 1MB transaction has, say 1000 inputs, and each input has an OP_CHECKSIG, then each input requires a 1MB hash. Totalling 1GB. A 2MB transaction would, then, have 2000 inputs, each requiring 2MB of hashing. Totalling 4GB.

Soft fork Segregated Witness (the proposal talked about) and Hard fork Segregated Witness (an alternative that is identical in advantages, except it's a hard fork rather than a soft fork)
The difference turns out to be really small from an implementation perspective. In the soft fork, the witness commitment (the merkle root of a merkle tree containing all witnesses of all transactions in a block) is stored in the coinbase transaction (or alternatively it could be in the last transaction of a block, which has some minor advantages), whereas in the hard fork it is stored in a purposely made field in the block (inside the existing merkle tree I guess would make sense), making it a hard fork - because old nodes will not understand this.
In both cases, the actual witnesses are stored separately from the transactions, and they both offer the exact same advantages. One could argue the hard fork alternative might look a bit nicer in the end, but it's actually a pretty trivial difference implementing it. The soft fork seems much more appealing because of this; all current nodes will continue to function and the upgrade will be opt-in.
As an analogy, the hard fork variety is like smashing out all of your teeth, resulting in long term agony, because a single tooth is crooked, then replacing it with a brand spankin new artificial dental inventory, whereas the soft fork is like wearing braces for a few months.

In the case of an uncontroversial hard fork (one which presumably miners would not have a problem with), I think it'd be good if there's a miner vote in addition to this.

@_date: 2015-12-07 15:19:44
SW doesn't solve any of the bandwidth, latency, or validation cost problems; the amount of data transmitted aswell as the computation required to fully validate is identical. What it does allow is larger perceived block sizes without a hard fork, because most of the 'bulk' in a block can now be snuck out of it, only committing to the 'bulk' within it.
As an analogy, we can now circumvent the 20kg luggage weight restriction on an international flight, by taking all of our clothes out of the luggage and wearing it, replacing the space savings with more stuff. (You've snuck more stuff into the plane, but you're still carrying all the weight)

Yes. See the 'calculation' bit in the original white paper:


If just 10% of the hashing power were adversarial, they could make this happen once in every ~5000 blocks.


Similarly, if the economic majority is not on that chain, then you can be 100% sure your 6 confirmations make for worthless money.


It's still there, though removing it and replacing with a headers-first dynamic checkpointing sort-of-thing is highly desirable. It checkpoints 100k or so blocks back, and they are hard-coded in the Bitcoin Core client, its intention isn't to prevent reorgs down to that level (although it also does that), but to speed up initial blockchain synchronisation by adding the reasonable assumption that every block up to that point is correct.
If these checkpoints ever end up preventing a 100k reorg, then Bitcoin as a whole is badly broken to begin with because the incentive structure apparently doesn't secure the chain sufficiently.
@_date: 2015-12-18 18:40:09
An SW hard fork is in many ways more complex than the soft fork.
In order not to break SPV, we're gonna have to lie to these nodes and tell them there's double the amount of transactions in a block, for instance (merkle tree depth will differ). It's not that great.
I still think it's more desirable than the soft fork, but not in the short term: a nice and boring hard fork SW in a few years (5+) - when it's uncontroversial and there's little else to do seems much more preferable to me. That'll give us time to figure out the best way to stick multiple commitments in the merkle root, or incorporate whatever else will be desirable, like perhaps even something like braiding.

You mean asymmetric cryptography / digital signatures, ECDSA in this case. It isn't encryption.
In many (old) unspent transaction outputs, the public key of this scheme is exposed (in current transactions this key is hashed). This means that if ECDSA breaks (which is something quantum computing can do in somewhat practical time), then funds in those outputs can be stolen.
This is not true for (not-reused) transactions of the pay-to-pubkey-hash and pay-to-script-hash transactions. They are (way more) secure.
If/when quantum computing is threatening to become practical, then we'll have to swap out ECDSA for something else (probably a hash-based DSA). And decide what to to about all unspent and now-insecure outputs. (Ie. Make them unspendable)
If you're using Bitcoin properly (never reusing an address), then you are completely secure. If not, you *might* have a problem in 10-20 years or so.

Yes, but they won't get confirmed. Also, this is only true if it is targetted.


This will be true of any upgrade, hard fork or soft fork. If even miners can't be bothered to upgrade then we are in a really bad spot. Staying on top of developments in this network is literally what they are being paid for.


I'm not trying to downplay the paramount importance of validating and upgrading here: everyone should upgrade (or voice their objections) as soon as they get wind of it.
But as far as attack surfaces go: they are limited.
Also note that comparable vulnerabilities exist in the case where we're upgrading through hard forks, but will be more serious because, contrary to soft forks, a 'bad' chain (the pre-hard-fork-one) won't get taken over by the 'correct' chain - because they are incompatible with one another.

Implement it right off the bat and regard the current Bitcoin's tx format as a false and non-existent god: 8 byte amount does not exist on this chain, 33 byte Pedersen commitments are the only truth.


Do you mean if this sidechain is made mandatory through a soft fork in Bitcoin, where miners only allow pegging coins to this sidechain and nothing else (no legacy transactions of any kind, just the peg), then de-facto all of Bitcoin's coins can only move to or on this sidechain, and indeed this has been implemented as a soft-fork.
If this is it, then I can only imagine this will make a lot of people mad, though. But it will have been a soft fork ;)

If the node operator is willing to trust nothing but that, then only the headers would suffice.
Nodes are unwilling to trust anything beside the genesis hash - and for a fair deal of them, and only to a point, also the following checkpoints.


Doesn't seem to me this is an either/or. Even without a better plan, the 1MB can be stretched - just not to the extreme.


Trust, however, *is* an either/or. If you're willing to trust a teeny-tiny bit, then an entire security model based on 0 trust goes right out the window. Trusting a peer to give you the wrong UTXO set, while also trusting it to give you the fraud-proofs revealing that fact, is logically senseless. Fraud-proofs improve on the SPV security model; they are already trusting a teeny-tiny bit, and fraud proofs allow them to trust a teeny-tiny bit less.

It doesn't. It tracks ownership internally, off-chain. All coins Coinbase controls on behalf of their users is swiftly moved to cold storage. There is no 1-user-1-address type of deal, it's a full custodial wallet, so it takes full control of all your coins, including storage.

My back of the envelope calculation for *my specific situation* (situation being VPSs):
For a fully validating **pruning node**, and any average block size below at least 50MB, there is *no change in cost*.
For a fully validating **archival/storage node**, and the assumption of an average block size of **8 MB** (~20x increase with *current* stats), I will be needing about 30 GB of storage every month. Storage is somewhat expensive for VPSs (for some god-forsaken reason). It'll cost 1 dollar per 10GB per month (storage addon plan available to *my situation*). So cost increase given this information will be:
    price = (vps_price + (num_months_since_now * 3usd)) / month   
In other words, if the average block size were to magically increase to 8MB today. I will be paying **44 USD / month** a year from now, **instead of &lt;10 USD / month** today.
By then, however, it'll be cheaper to purchase a dedicated server and host it myself. And that cost will increase much less frequently and by smaller increments.
For *my situation*, storage is the only bottleneck when I'm running an archival/storage node. Running a pruning node will also give me a fully validating node, and this will eliminate this bottleneck. For *my situation*, however, I need to run an archival node, so the cost increase here will be somewhat significant.

Thinking of block size as a commodity with a cost is very useful, I believe - but using orphan rates to find a market equilibrium that sets an effective optimal block size is not. Block-size-dependent-orphan-rates can be trivially bypassed to the point it is irrelevant and outshouted by noise of other factors using a myriad of ways, including centralisation into fewer pools, but also IBLTs, Bitcoin-NG, weak blocks and things like the fast relay network.
The resulting cost which would supposedly form a market is so low that blocks can be faaaar higher than this network can possibly handle while still retaining its primary properties of decentralisation and unpermissioned participation - wherein any participant can take part, and make absolutely sure to themselves the system behaves as intended with little effort.

If such hard fork ends up changing the block size limit and nothing else (ie. Something that would intentionally make everything backward incompatible), which seems preferable, then all SPV wallets would continue to function fine on top of the chain that has the majority hashing power.
If you're running a node and using a wallet based off that, *then* you need to upgrade (if you are in agreement with the change).
@_date: 2015-12-22 11:12:51


Because presumably you don't know about segwit at this point, and you therefore do not and cannot make use of it (well, you can, but then you would be negligent of validating something you now know how to validate).
Make no mistake - it's a degraded security model. But it is hardly vulnerable to attack: any attack on an unupgraded node specific to a soft-fork update involves abusing the new rule introduced, because you don't check for it. But since you also do not make use of it - most attack vectors are eliminated.
Put another way, so long as majority hashing power isn't affected; neither are you.


The one attack is:
- Create a fork using majority hashing power
- Release funds out of segwit transactions into your ownership - which you do not validate for
- Buy things for free (edit: I should mention, only applies to nodes/merchants that haven't upgraded)

@_date: 2015-06-08 21:39:16
Yes, the attacking miner must, by design of this attack, continue generating big-ass blocks in order to keep their unfair advantage over the competition. Assuming they can propagate their block exceptionally fast, and other miners compliantly start validating it while mining the old, which potentially could take many seconds, it will have an advantage.
The goal here isn't to do a 51% attack or anything like that, it's to unfairly gain an advantage over competition, allowing one to be more profitable for producing the same work, essentially by tricking the competition into doing useless work while they are still validating.
In theory, the attack works, and it is implicitly mitigated by the block size limit, but it's quite easily solved through various methods (albeit crudely) if ever this attack were to be tried, to be honest, leaving only the disadvantage of a hugely bloated blockchain.

Higher value transactions impose no greater cost on the network than any other transaction. From a technical perspective, there is no reason to charge them a higher fee.
Whether it makes some economic sense for high-value transactions to pay for small-sized-coffee-transactions is another matter. I would argue it doesn't.
Miners are free to define their own block composition policies. If some of them consider a percentage-based fee on the transaction amount reasonable, then they can implement it.
Fee policies are not part of the consensus ruleset.

Any Bitcoin transaction is just a set of previously created outputs transformed into a new set of outputs (by consuming the previous outputs - as inputs).
This chain of ownership is best thought of as cash; you have 3x a 5 dollar bill in your wallet, if you want to give me 10 dollars, then you would give me 2 of those bills.
In Bitcoin, those 2x 5 dollar bills are then converted into 1x 10 dollar bill (as opposed to cash). Coins are continually merged and split in this way.
In Bitcoin, the fee is the difference between the aggregate amount in the inputs and the aggregate amount in the outputs.
Let's say you (Alice) have 15 BTC, split in 3 inputs of 5 BTC each (outA, outB, outC), and you want to send me (Bob) 10. You estimate a 1 BTC fee should do the trick into getting it into a block.
In this scenario, Alice would define a transaction like this:
    outA (5 BTC)
    outB (5 BTC)
    outC (5 BTC)
    outD (10 BTC) for Bob
    outF (4 BTC) for Alice (change)
There's a 1BTC difference here, which the miner may claim. This is the fee.
The fee isn't explicitly defined anywhere - it is merely the difference in inputs and outputs.

Correct, the upper limit is 21 million bitcoin, and this upper limit is scheduled to be met somewhere around the year 2140.
ELI5 of bitcoin:
Everyone who participates in the Bitcoin network enforces this upper limit. Bitcoin is a protocol in which all participants enforce a set of rules. Bitcoins are given to those who move the network forward in a way it's aligned with those rules (miners), other miners and nodes observe the way everyone else behaves, and if the seen behaviour checks out, it is accepted into the blockchain; the public ledger we all maintain.
Roughly every 10 minutes a miner will find a block which contains a block reward of (currently) 25 bitcoins. This block contains transactions that have occurred in the past 10 minutes (sort of), in order. This block is broadcast to everyone in the network, and everyone in the network will check this block for validity using the set of rules. Rules such as (formulated abstractly):
- Block block must contain a proof-of-work which satisfies an agreed-upon difficulty (put simply: proof of the cost of mining)
- All transactions in this block must be valid (signatures must check out, tx format must observe the rules, transactions must only spend previous transaction outputs)
- Timestamp in the block headers must be inside some rough bounds (2 hours before or after present / network-adjusted time)
- Block must be smaller than 1MB
- Combined hash (merkle root of merkle tree) of all transactions must yield the root in the block headers
- Etc. etc.
If a new block is failing any of those rules, the network will reject and discard the block, and the network will not acknowledge the block subsidy given to the miner who submitted the block.
There's another rule which makes sure the miners in the network generate a block every 10 minutes on average, which is enforced every 2016 blocks.
Another rule makes sure the block reward is *halved* every 210 000 blocks. Enforcing this last rule makes sure that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin generated in the system.
Anyone who disobeys any of these rules will have their contributions to the network and the blockchain (new blocks) rejected.

XT has a rule which will deliberately make such a node hard fork off the Bitcoin network's current consensus rules when some conditions are met. It *can* be regarded as an altcoin because, effectively, its consensus ruleset is not that of the Bitcoin network.
Whether its UTXO-set up to the point where the split is activated is the same, is irrelevant in this regard. Same goes for whether any other consensus rule is the same. 
In a sentence: The consensus ruleset is not exactly equal to network consensus, therefore it is an altcoin.

The fee on the transaction you linked is fine.
However, the funding input hasn't been confirmed either, and is 2 transactions deep. Here's where it all starts:
It is 3k large and pays the fee that would perhaps be suitable for a 1k transaction:
So long as this transaction isn't being confirmed (which might take a while) will the transactions that spend from it also remain unconfirmed.

@_date: 2015-06-15 11:24:25
It's probably true.
I also remember reading about some mining pools which give 120% or so return to the people mining on it, because there's people who want to buy 'untainted virgin coins' directly out of the mining reward, rather than coins that have already had ownership of another, and they're happily prepared to pay the extra 20% (or whatever the premium is) on those coins.
There's also a huge [OTC market]( where bitcoins are traded person-to-person using a web-of-trust, mostly invisible to the public. This is where a bunch of early-adopters trade. It's where brokers like Coinbase and other high-volume companies or people get their coins from. The amounts traded there are huge, hardly move the price directly, and are not registered on any exchanges (though, of course, they do affect the demand/supply equation). Volume there is likely at least as high as all the exchanges combined.

I don't believe they are in the long term (though in the short-term, yes, definitely). I don't like extension blocks because they *permanently* add complexity to the protocol. It may be less controversial (although by observation here and elsewhere, it may not be) and less risky than hard forking into Jeff's or Gavin's or any other proposal *now*, but in 10 years we'll still be stuck with extension blocks. Whereas for most hard fork proposals the opposite is true: when the discussion is over and done with and *something* has changed, the issue will be exactly that: over and done with.
That said, Gavin's consensus-less move to Bitcoin-XT is (I think) absurd and probably the riskiest way to go in the short-term.

That's a good way of putting it, yeah.
I should clarify that last sentence:


Strict interpretation would say that sentence is wrong: finding a block is equally probable at all times. But just to confuse the reader a bit:
For the probability of finding a block in, let's say the 20th minute after *current* time (regardless of when you read this), we solve:
    f(x) = e^-λ * λ^x / x!
where λ = 10 (confirmation time / mean)
x = 20 (target)
e = 2.718... (Euler's number)
    f(20) = 2.718^-10 * 10^20 / 20! = ~.19%
a rather small chance of that happening indeed.
But, if after 10 minutes a block still hasn't popped up, and I run the calculation again for the same time frame (which is now 10 minutes from now), we get:
    f(10) = 2.718^-10 * 10^10 / 10! = ~12.52%
our chances 'shot up'! Magic!
It's a funny thing, probabilities.

To fully validate and not relay / help propagate, you would only need downstream. You will arguably be in a worse position because you cannot monitor the network as well as you would as a relay, but you will be able to fully validate the blockchain using only downstream.
Shitty upstreams aren't really helping the network anyway.

"From" addresses don't really exist in bitcoin, though they can often be inferred.
More here: 


There isn't, it's pseudonymity at best.


The best way to think of bitcoin in this context is cash. When I get my salary in cash from my employer (X), then give some of that to my brother (Y), who then spends it at the grocery store to buy some apples (Z), then in bitcoin you can follow that chain of transactions completely. But no identity is explicitly attached to any of those transactions; all of those changes of ownership of coins happen through pseudonymous handles (addresses) which contain no personalized information, but they are traceable.

No, I'm imagining the contingencies if that were to happen. Full nodes concede to be able to handle the situation if blocks were fully saturated. This is that last shred of certainty in the resources that are required of them they have.
If blocks, at the suggested doubling shedule, fill up such that a soft fork is required to limit them because 'the network can't handle it', then full nodes lost that control and certainty in favor of miners. If a soft fork may be required *for this reason*, then this suggests the (currently proposed) doubling schedule is far too optimistic.

Well. Realistically, it can't. It's a terribly slow beast of a thing, but it just so happens to be the most secure collaboratively constructed database on the planet.
Because it's somewhat super inflexible, sidechains are a thing, altcoins are a thing, factom is a thing, private blockchains are a thing.
P2SH did a lot as far as more easily enabling secure/private smart contracts goes.
CLTV and CSV/CRLTV will do a lot as far as making smart contracts smarter.
And finally getting rid of malleability through SW will enable a whole 'nother spectrum of the things.
When all that's happened, things can *really* start to get interesting on the Bitcoin blockchain. Layer-2 protocols can essentially replace all fork-abominations the Bitcoin blockchain's sluggishness has spawned so far.
- Sidechains rather than altcoins (for experimenting with new features)
- (Micro)-payments to the lightning network and/or full duplex payments channels rather than pushing all of it to the blockchain.
- Factom (et. al.) may be replaced by a decentralized proof-committing network pushing an aggregate of commitments to the blockchain periodically, if needed - eliminating hash commitment spam. No worthless separate tokens to subsideze the thing - can use Lightning and good ole bitcoins for this.
- Anything and everything that needs a proof and a transfer of value; Bitcoin's blockchain is there to provide it - but now, without having to touch it.
God knows what else people can come up with.

It isn't gonna break like that.


It's a hashing algorithm, not encryption or a DSA, this means that even with the most evilest of intentions you're kind of limited with the various extravagant types of backdoors you can put in. There's no polynomial math problem underlying its security, there's no key to recover, there's no pattern to deduce.
Most of the information has been thrown away calculating the hash, and there isn't enough to go around that can go and 'reduce' a 32 byte output to 80 bytes worth of input without expending any work.
The worst that can happen with SHA256 with respect to PoW is the discovery of shortcuts in the method to calculating a hash, meaning you can come to a correct output in less computational steps. This is not a problem at all; difficulty will adjust and everything will keep purring along nicely. In fact, ASICs already take advantage a possible shortcut which allows them to skip the last cycle in the hash calculation, netting them a few percentage efficiency gain.
There's also another interesting probabilistic shortcut which can net another few percentage gains which is being played with. Concept here is: there's, say, a 90% chance the correct hash will be calculated, but it'll allow the machine to operate at, say, 70% of usual energy consumption - the difference is pure profit.


Same as the above; this doesn't reduce work to 0, difficulty will simply adjust and nothing really astonishing happen.
As far as PoW goes, you can use pretty much everything no matter how broken it is.

And in addition to that, he's advocating to rely on first-seen policy. Which is a policy that cannot be enforced by the network and should not be relied upon for accepting payments (even though this dependency is widespread today).

You mean (dis)connecting based on user-agent? That doesn't serve any purpose and has no advantage (only disadvantage) because the user-agent is something a peer advertises: it can be lied about. Say a node connects to as wide a variety of user-agents it knows about, then all an attacker would need to do is have each of his compromised nodes advertise a different one. Similarly, if a node is only connecting to - say - Bitcoin Core 0.12 nodes, then all an attacker would have to do is advertise his nodes as being 0.12.
A node is and should be completely agnostic of what user-agent it is connected to.
Here's how Bitcoin Core attempts to connect widely to the network:
    /** Stochastic address manager
     *
     * Design goals:
     *  * Keep the address tables in-memory, and asynchronously dump the entire table to     peers.dat.
     *  * Make sure no (localized) attacker can fill the entire table with his nodes/addresses.
     *
     * To that end:
     *  * Addresses are organized into buckets.
     *    * Addresses that have not yet been tried go into 1024 "new" buckets.
     *      * Based on the address range (/16 for IPv4) of the source of information, 64 buckets are     selected at random.
     *      * The actual bucket is chosen from one of these, based on the range in which the     address itself is located.
     *      * One single address can occur in up to 8 different buckets to increase selection chances     for addresses that
     *        are seen frequently. The chance for increasing this multiplicity decreases exponentially.
     *      * When adding a new address to a full bucket, a randomly chosen entry (with a bias     favoring less recently seen
     *        ones) is removed from it first.
     *    * Addresses of nodes that are known to be accessible go into 256 "tried" buckets.
     *      * Each address range selects at random 8 of these buckets.
     *      * The actual bucket is chosen from one of these, based on the full address.
     *      * When adding a new good address to a full bucket, a randomly chosen entry (with a     bias favoring less recently
     *        tried ones) is evicted from it, back to the "new" buckets.
     *    * Bucket selection is based on cryptographic hashing, using a randomly-generated 256-bit     key, which should not
     *      be observable by adversaries.
     *    * Several indexes are kept for high performance. Defining DEBUG_ADDRMAN will     introduce frequent (and expensive)
     *      consistency checks for the entire data structure.

Drilling down proof-of-work consensus to its roots reveals the very simple reason it just works:
    work = energy * time
By proving you have performed work, you prove you have *expended* energy (in the form of effort) for a length of time; it requires you to *consume* a resource (energy, in this case mostly electricity) which *commits you to a decision you have made* (in this case doing work on the best chain). Rewarding commitments to making *this* decision incentivizes participants to enforce it, which - if performed in a distributed/decentralized fashion - leads to decentralized consensus on that shared decision.
Methods of achieving decentralized consensus in a way other than PoW; ways that do not expend energy (namely, a real-world resource such as electricity) which causes participants to really *commit* to a decision, has so far not shown me it will function correctly with quite the same level of certainty.
That said, proof-of-work consensus as we know it today requires participants to waste the resource they are consuming (quite literally to throw it all down the bin, and prove that), which may be considered sub-optimal. An alternative that gives us the same (extremely) robust method of achieving decentralized consensus may therefore be more desirable in the future, but today, none of the proposed alternatives impress me greatly.

Yes, coins that existed before the fork, exist on both chains (that is, assuming it's not a super-weird fork which invalidates previous outputs).

The miner who mined the block, assuming it can propagate the block to other miners in a timely manner, can continue working on the new block while other miners are still busy validating, causing them to waste time mining an old block, gaining the 'attacking' miner an unfair advantage (they get more time mining blocks than their competition does).
This attack only works if the miner who is doing the attack has a sizeable hashrate, is exceptionally well connected, and does not publish all or most of the transactions in the big-ass block (which otherwise could be prevalidated). The attack can quite trivially be identified when it's observed many transactions in a new block are not present in the mempool, and possibly be averted by a rough and loosely coordinated, and likely temporary, soft fork agreed upon by non-attacking majority of miners (if they so desire, and this would be very controversial).
A side effect of this attack is also that it will take longer and consume more resources to validate the blockchain and run a node, which if the blocks in question are huge could be a real issue (although I am not all that convinced because I doubt the attack is in any way permanent).
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:34:49

Technically, this would allow one to forget UTXO's, but at first glance will have the following (non-trivial) side-effects:
1) Added complexity and responsibility for users and wallets to store and keep track of their UTXOs; storing *just* a mnemonic phrase or private key would no longer be enough. This is a big UX problem.
2) Spending requires users to broadcast the UTXO(s) along with the spending transaction, or the network cannot validate the spend. Adds more complexity to wallets and the messaging protocol.
3) Legitimately spending an old UTXO *requires* the network to have been honest at the time when the UTXO commitment / coalesced set has been made. **This would allow spending non-existent coins if the network was dishonest**, or the network to forget UTXO's altogether. Currently, at no point does any participant *trust* that the network was honest at any time, participants rely solely on proof-of-work, so this would be deal-breaking.

When you say deflation, do you mean an appreciation of the overall value of the system with no newly introduced currency, thereby increasing purchasing power over time and encouraging saving? Or do you mean the removal of currency out of the system, while overall value remains the same, thereby increasing purchasing power over time and encouraging saving?
They both result in the same, but are fundamentally different in concept.
To clarify: the former can happen in bitcoin through organic growth and increasing + productive economic activity in the ecosystem, the latter *only* happens when currency (both fake, like in fractional reserve banking and real, like people losing coins or intentionally destroying them) is removed (or in the case of fractional reserve banking; repayed) from the system.
If deflation happens because of increased productivity (the former) then that doesn't necessarily mean loss of profit for those participating in the economy: the economy is essentially running more efficiently than it was previously; no value is lost, only gained. Businesses can now sell more (increased productivity), for less (resulting deflation), but with equal (or likely higher, because deflation is lagging) profit. The ability to pay off debt or the ability to lend is not affected for this reason.
In the case of the latter, however, the economy *loses* value, it contracts, because previously existing currency is being removed from the economy. Profits go down and it's getting harder to pay off debt. This is what happens with the euro, usd and most fiat currencies which bear with fractional reserve banking when we're talking about deflation (when debt is repayed: currency disappears), it also happened in bitcoin when gox went sideways; they were essentially running a fractional reserve bank and all creditors immediately had their currency disappear.
If we're in a deflationary situation due to economic contraction: lending and the ability to pay off debt is badly affected.
If we're in a deflationary situation because of economic growth and increased productivity: lending and the ability to pay off debt is not affected.

If you're not running a pruning node, storage is gonna be the most expensive. With pruning, it's bandwidth, by a long shot. Pruning lets you fully validate at ~1GB of storage, slowly rising over time.

At 1mb blocks it'll cost ~3 * 60 * 10 * 0.03 * 6 * 24 = 7776 USD to fully saturate blocks for an entire day at 3 tx/sec and 3 ct/tx. Maybe that's quite cheap if you have deep pockets and a strong incentive to attack the network, sure.
Quite obviously, fees are gonna go up. Let's say it takes 30 cents for a transaction to enter the blockchain. It'll take $70k daily to continue attacking the network at this point. Getting more expensive, miners rejoice. Maybe the attacker is fine with that, fees will go up further. Let's say 3 bucks per transaction. $700k *daily*, nearly a million, to keep attacking the network. Miners are totally fine with this, but users will, at some point, tire of buying coffee at 3 dollar fees - they will continue to use bitcoin only for large purchases. Even still, at this point, it's cheaper than most alternatives methods of digital payment given large purchases.
None of this is catastrophic, and none of it will destroy the network (miners are still profitable, are they not?), and at some point an attacker is going to run out of money. Close to $ a million a day is gonna sting no matter the depth of the pocket it's coming from.
I'm not all too worried about this, it's only the fact validation of the now bloated blockchain takes a bit longer - which, still, is not catastrophic.
Considering all costs of attack here are multiplied at higher block sizes: let this imaginary attacker commence; the network will welcome the cost on their behalf.

I'll start off with a previous answer to this question a few weeks back, and follow up with recent developments:
The block size limit is a hard limitation on the size of blocks imposed by an early version of bitcoin core to ensure the barrier to fully validating the blockchain and bitcoin network is sufficiently low that essentially anyone can do it. By setting the limit to 1MB, practically anyone with any device was able to fully participate while protecting the growing network from potential DoS or otherwise harmful attacks.
Now, we're about to bump into this limit for what appear to be legitimate reasons; the network has grown such that 1MB blocks are justified.
Because this limit was imposed so (relatively) long ago, while the network has grown so much in the past few years, the rule has become a rather pesky limit which is now hard to get rid of in a way everyone agrees is the best or correct way to do.
Because nobody, nor a strong majority, for now, agrees what to do; nothing happens. This is both one of bitcoin's strengths, aswell as (in this case) its weakness.
The problem we're bumping into is that the network, by its own rules, will only permit about 3-4 transactions per second. Ideally, judging by what most agree with, we should be able to do much more, in order to accomodate much more activity and provide more value and utility to the network.
The solution is to change the rules we all agree exist and are valid. But this presents us with another problem, which we refer to as a 'hard fork'; we'll be changing bitcoin in a way it isn't compatible with the way it used to work, which means we'll make previous versions of the protocol incompatible with the new / proposed versions. Anyone running an older version of the bitcoin protocol / software will (assuming a hard fork) be discarded from the network (as far as their participation goes), which is a big problem considering bitcoin is supposed to be a network which doesn't require you to conform to anyone's thoughts or ideas or rules.
If we can agree on a way to change the rules such that everyone is happy (which many people are working on) or can at least accept the way we change things; nothing bad will happen. But so long as we are not in agreement in the way we will change things (if at all) we will only fragment the network and the community if undesirable changes are continued to be pushed.
Eventually though, this problem will be solved and put behind us, one way or another.
Some (concrete) options that are on the table now are the following:
BIP 100 - The current limit imposed on the network enforced by the entirety (nodes, miners) shall be removed, and replaced by a miner-enforced soft-fork mechanism which makes miners the deciders (through voting) on when and by how much to increase the block size limit. A (historic) hard limit of 32 MB remains and must be removed through (another) hard fork later down the line. This proposal will likely provide organic growth of the block size limit with the network's adoption and miner's capability to deploy hardware, but nodes must yield the consensus-enforced control they have on the network and in (arguably extreme) scenario's be unable to cheaply validate the network and blockchain.
Gavin's doubling schedule
The block size limit is to be increased to 8MB and will double every 2 years after that. Nodes remain in control of enforcing this consensus rule, but whether or not this rule is too optimistic or pessimistic (whether the limit increases keep up with network and hardware capability growth fast enough, or not fast enough) is completely unclear (and unpredictable). The limit, in this proposal, does not organically grow with the network, it grows at a predetermined rate (which may be wrong). This patch has been deployed in the (rather controversial) Bitcoin-XT fork which is maintained by Mike Hearn rather than the Bitcoin core developers which have created and worked on all previous versions of Bitcoin Core and the bitcoin protocol. This hard fork would be done at a (rather low) 75% miner agreement threshold, if a fork happens at this threshold and nodes, merchants, businesses have not adapted to this version we'll be heading into a very turbulent time indeed.
Do nothing.
The limit shall remain at 1MB, blocks will likely fill up, causing transaction fees to rise and a fee market to come into existence. On-chain transaction throughput will remain at current levels of 3-4 tx/sec. The payment network could grind down to a halt (multiple or many blocks for the first confirmation), this could drive user adoption down. Threshold to validating the network and bitcoin blockchain can be done by anyone at very low (and lowering) cost at this limit, forever.
Something else - there's a large number of other proposals out there, here's a more complete list:

Nodes validate the blockchain, and they monitor and participate in the bitcoin network by relaying blocks and transactions.
They don't necessarily *improve* performance, in theory a single (honest) super-node is the most efficient, but they do make the network more robust and - given many independent operators - decentralize the network because they each validate the blockchain and enforce consensus rules.

I think I might be good with this. A linear base block size increase like this, along with SW, which makes it de-facto exponential at a pace that seems reasonable, might just be excellent.
Just, "per 10-minute segment", I would assume that should be "per block"?
If not, then how would this work? There is no consensus on what time it is at the tip of the chain.

Well, this rather has me stumped and leaves me guessing..
I can understand how new opcodes / algorithms / script-related stuff can be implemented as a soft-fork: adding new meaning to tx formats such as OP_TRUE [foo] [voodoo] [bar] and have miners enforce this, sure.
The problem, then, is to replace the 8 byte amount field in an output with these 33-byte Pedersen commitments. You're implying a soft-fork can do this, so incrementing the tx version number and defining a new format which does exactly this should be enough? How do nodes which do not understand this format behave? Do they cry softly in a corner but relay these transactions anyway - unaware of whether or not they are valid, or indeed what the heck they are in the first place, or do they consider them invalid and fork off?
Considering this can be a soft-fork, as you say, I would assume the former. Is an old node, then, not taking a leap of faith in assuming the network remains honest; it cannot check these new transactions for validity, and it can therefore never be completely sure the blockchain is compliant with the consensus rules it is aware of; parts of it cannot be interpreted by this node.
What's the deal here?
@_date: 2015-06-24 22:22:27
That's a very good and important question as we're nearing the block size limit.
The short answer is no, we don't have a mechanism for it up and running that can do this in a good way.
The long answer is yes. There has been at least one solution for it for well over a year (2?) now.
Today, if you send a transaction with an insufficient fee, it will not be confirmed and if no fee was attached at all it might currently not even propagate through the network. Your node/wallet could try and rebroadcast the transaction periodically, but it can take a long time before a confirmation regardless (if ever).
The solution we have now is called Replace-by-fee, by Peter Todd. Recently there was an episode about a (large) mining pool that adopted this (currently unsafe) patch.
Replace-by-fee (RBF) is a patch which allows miners to replace a transaction in the mempool with another transaction that spends the same outputs but gives the miner a higher fee. Of course, miners can only do this when a user double spends their (unconfirmed) transaction with another transaction that pays a higher fee. Economically, it might make more sense for miners to use this (moar profits).
A problem with RBF, now, is that it allows you to buy coffee at starbucks, take your coffe off the counter, walk away, double spend to yourself, and get your money back, getting coffee for free; stealing. Because most payment processors currently rely on what's called first-seen policy, where nodes only relay the first transaction they see (so no unconfirmed double spends) and miners only mine the first transaction they see; accepting unconfirmed transactions as payment is made more safe because of this. The problem here, is this policy cannot be enforced in the network, and abusing first-seen policy (and by extension, stealing from those that rely on the policy) is therefore possible.
RBF could be considered such an abuse, but first-seen is inherently broken because it's unenforceable, so we need a better solution than first-seen policy anyway. In addition to RBF allowing you to steal, it also allows you to kick transactions that are 'stuck' into a block, and some other nice things. But we still need to fix the whole 'stealing' problem.
One solution to RBF allowing you to steal, is RBF-scorched-earth, and I won't go into it too far, but it allows the victim of an unconfirmed double spend to double spend that (yet again) until the entire payment is converted into fees (so the thief does not get his money back, but neither does the merchant/victim). Theoretically this means there's no point in stealing, because you will only give the profits to miners. It's a controversial solution, but it could work.
Another is first-seen-safe RBF, which, put simply, only allows double spending an unconfirmed transaction in a way none of the original payments are changed. It works and it's totally safe to deploy in today's ecosystem, but it doesn't have as many advantages as pure RBF.
If any of this is implemented today, and software/wallets improved to make use of it, then a fee market can seamlessly be realized. Today, however, only a handful (couple hundred, maybe) nodes will even relay an (RBF) double spend, and few miners will mine them.


A transaction (well, its individual outputs) *cannot* be referred to in the blockchain more than once. Only when a transactio is unconfirmed can it be double spent and have a chance of being accepted in the blockchain; consensus rules make any block which contains a double spend invalid, and nodes will swiftly ignore and discard it.

GreenAddress or BitGo may be an option for you.
You *will* have to store and secure your mnemonic key phrase which represents your private key seed (optionally protected with another password). But actually spending anything *requires* a co-sign from GreenAddress or BitGo, which you must authenticate with. They store an encrypted form of your private seed which only you can access on your devices, or using a password (+ 2FA). Both GreenAddress and BitGo provide you spending limits, 2 factor authentication, watch-only, backup, export and recovery features, etc. Takes your mind off the full responsibility you have with alternatives.
Blockchain.info is quickly becoming an outdated service; single addresses, terrible privacy, questionable practices. They give you full ownership, and with it, full responsibility while handling your money on top of a platform which has been compromised before (poor RNG's, predictable R values). Meh.

While that may appear true, the opposite side of the argument is that miners are (more indirectly) incentivized to maximize network utility, leading to higher block size limits with more transactions with a higher *aggregate* amount of fees, giving them more profit.
You can only limit supply when demand exists regardless of it, limiting supply in the size of blocks might aswell hurt demand (certainly if stretched too far) by yielding utility (many blocks before confirmation; long delays), thereby hurting profits.

If we could, we could do away with mining as it exists today. Proof-of-work is the best 'work-around' to this problem so far.


It's effectively a Sybil attack, it would be far easier for me to isolate peers into my personal little Bitcoin network. I would be the sole entity feeding them blocks and, had I a fair deal of hashing power at my disposal, would be able to feed them a parallel chain and use that to steal from them through double spending.
Bitcoin Core is pretty good at dealing with this, though. And all a node needs is a single honest peer to connect to the correct network and chain.

If we could create a 'market' where nodes can come to consensus on things, we could just as well scrap mining through PoW entirely: no point in doing useless work to come to consensus following an already collectively agreed-upon decision made through other means.


And that's why we can't do it. 'Work' is the only objective metric we've so far come up with that can measure consensus. Without proof-of-work, and a set of game theoretic economic incentives to go along with it, a pending Sybil attack will always be lurking round the corner.
There's no good way to incorporate automated decision making on changes to the consensus ruleset into the protocol.
Here's how we might do it outside of the protocol:

I wasn't arguing that it is.


The 'worst' behaviour a miner currently can have just also happens to be the most profitable from the miner's perspective. By design, Bitcoin expects miners to always act in *their own* best interests, not necessarily the network's. If this 'worst' behaviour (from *your* perspective) is in the miner's best interest, then we should expect they will exhibit that behaviour at any time.

I don't know what she's selling, but if it's digital goods that are made available immediately, then she shouldn't be accepting 0-conf in the first place. *Even without RBF patches like this getting into Core.* And *certainly* not without a payment processor in between, whose job it is to deal with these things (considering you've mentioned she isn't tech savvy enough to know about any of this herself - at least for now, having a payment processor in between will be the sensible thing to do).
If it's physical goods she's selling, and shipping, then there shouldn't be any problem: If the payment is double-spent, she can find out after the fact and before shipping, and simply cancel. No harm, no foul.
For most businesses except perhaps payment processors (which already should have contingencies in place), any of this RBF business shouldn't change anything.

Bitcoin runs on the idea that it's possible to create a decentralized network which maintains a ledger in a way it's immutable by providing economic incentives for expended cost of peers in this network who behave honestly while expanding the ledger. The incentives (block subsidy) are given to those who prove (through proof-of-work) to have expended a cost (mining) while behaving honestly.
Without economic incentives the network would only function if every participant is honest for altruistic reasons. This could happen, but since it's an open, decentralized and permissionless network, altruistic participants would be greatly outnumbered by malignant participants. There would be no *stake* in anyone's commitment to moving the network forward (in a way it's secure), and for that reason the likely outcome would be that the network will *not* move forward, and instead die.
Miners move the network forward in a way it's secure, and are given incentive to do this honestly.
Nodes, on the other hand, actually do little *for the network*. They primarily do validation of the network's integrity and correctness, and they do this mostly for the operator's own benefits (they allow the operator to be without trust in anyone; selfish reasons). Secondarily, they can be beneficial to SPV users (altruistically with little benefit to operator). Thirdly, they help the network by relaying transactions and blocks over it (altruistically with little benefit to operator).
The second and third functions can actually be completely covered by those who benefit from it (miners, companies like Coinbase or Circle, companies who have a vested interest in Bitcoin's adoption, wallet operators, universities), and altruistic peers. They don't *need* subsidy to exist, and the network doesn't *need* subsidized nodes to exist.

Sure, but changing arbitrary parameters won't make the issue go away.


It's perfectly reasonable to allow people to live under the same assumptions 10 years from now as they do now; unilaterally changing the implication of *their* assumptions is non-viable in Bitcoin. (well, it is, but it's called a hard fork)


Another arbitrary parameter.


That's not analogous to the issue.

A soft fork adds new backward-compatible rules, a hard fork changes/removes existing rules, or adds new backward-*incompatible* rules.
For example, I could (try, and fail, to) deploy a soft fork right now that says all blocks must have my signature in the coinbase, and must not contain any transactions. It'd remove all utility from this network; no miner beside myself could introduce new blocks, nor could any transaction ever take place, but it's compatible with all existing rules, and has only added new ones: a soft fork.

From the link:


Inability to see danger does not mean there is no danger, it means you need better eyesight.
Soft forking into lower block size limits is *harder* than hard forking into higher ones. The need for lower limits can not be as easily remediated when the network has already centralised into a state where those that *can* alter consensus rules are no longer the independent auditors that exist today, but are instead those centralised stakeholders that benefit from further centralisation.

Not exactly. Exchanges are exactly that: exchanges. They allow for the exchange of bitcoin with other things such as the US dollar. Exchanges are not meant to be used for day-to-day transacting, as a wallet, they are meant for exchangig and trading. Exchanges are companies like btce-e, bitstamp, OKCoin etc.
Then there's brokers, they allow you to purchase bitcoin while they do the actual exchange for you. These are companies like Circle and Coinbase. These brokers typically also provide a full custodial wallet which does all the transacting in bitcoin for you. You are required to trust them.
Then there's SPV (Simple Payment Verification) wallets. They are decentralized and minimize trust. They require the network to be honest, so there's some limited trust there.
Then there's full nodes, they allow you to fully validate everything that's going on in the network and the blockchain, and they do this without trusting anyone or anything.

Very limited compression on serialized transactions is possible given ugly hacks.
Standard transaction outputs (pay-to-pubkey-hash, pay-to-script, etc.) can be flagged, saving you a few bytes (less script, no sequence, no locktime, standard version). I reckon 12 bytes minimum, 2 bytes per output. This compression can't (shouldn't) live on to the blockchain, though. It's not that impressive.
Signatures cannot be compressed. (The bulk of data)
Prev txid can be compressed to be a pointer to a utxo rather than the full 32 byte hash. This requires utxo commitments through a soft fork, but it would save maybe 20 bytes per input (slowly decreasing as the utxo set grows).
You can do the same thing for reused addresses I should think, but that's not very effective because reusing them isn't very wise. And if you know a spending tx is valid (which you don't, and we're falling in the realm of full compression, not over-the-wire compression), you can scrap the address altogether and use the pubkey on the spending tx.
Block headers can be compressed by a little more than half, assuming you know the previous block and the merkle tree / full list of transactions. About ~50/80 bytes scrapped. Which isn't a lot seeing that the block headers alone grow linearly and are currently only some 30MB or so.
If you really try, I reckon you can losslessly compress the full blockchain to about 60-75% of its full size. Maybe less. But you won't be able to do any fast lookups or use this for a node. Purely archival.

A private key is a random number between 1 and 2^256 . The value space of this number is so large that given proper randomness it's impossible for 2 people to ever generate the same number; it will be unique.
Out of a private key a public key will be computed through ECDSA (specifically in bitcoin: secp256k1), which is a digital signature algorithm. ECDSA defines a curve on a surface, you can think of the private key as a point on this curve, and the public key as another point on the curve with a special relation to the private key. The public key can be computed/derived out of the private key, but the public key *cannot* feasibly be reversed to the private key.
Because some mathematical properties of the curve, and the private and public key points on this curve, it's possible to do some special things: You can *prove you own* the private key, without ever showing someone the private key, by exposing the public key to the public. By 'signing' some data with you private key (which remains secret), someone else can verify that your signature is valid by using your public key.
An address is a *hash* of your public key. A hashing algorithm (specifically in bitcoin: SHA256 and RIPE-MD) is an algorithm which computes a non-reversible set-length string of bits (SHA256: 256 bits, RIPEMD: 160 bits) out of an arbitrary input. The input in this case is the public key, and it will first be hashed by SHA256 and then RIPEMD. The result is a 160 bit number which is referred to as the address. The address is then encoded using BASE58CHECK, which encodes this number using a size-58 alphabet and a checksum (to account for typo's).
When you want to receive money from someone, you send him the BASE58CHECK encoded address (the thing that starts with a 1, or in case of P2SH addresses, a 3). This person derives the 160-bit address out of that and formats a transaction spending money to this address. If you then want to spend the money that has been sent to you, you will simply prove you own the private key which corresponds to the public key which, when hashed, yields the 160-bit address the money has been sent to. The network will validate this, and if it all checks out, the transaction will be valid and included in the blockchain.
Note that in this scheme the public key will only be exposed when you are *spending* money which has been previously sent to your *address*. An address has the added benefit of being protected by 3 algorithms, 2 of which are hashing algorithms which are exceptionally hard to break. The public key is protected only by ECDSA, which is secure, but a single-point-of-failure nonetheless.
It's generally better to never spend from the same address twice for this reason (security) aswell as privacy (there can only be one owner of an address, so multiple payments to the same address can possibly expose your identity), although it's perfectly possible. An address of which you posses the private key will always be valid to spend from.

Not even slightly, unfortunately.
There's loads of different opinions from each perspective, all of which are equally valid, yet contradictory. It's a highly debated topic and - at times - is turning into a poop fight alternated with constructive discussion. Progress is slow.
What's been especially bugging many in the technical community is Mike/Gavin's continued controversial pursuance of moving proposals to end this debate that do not have technical consensus over to Bitcoin-XT. While their efforts in actually starting the debate and moving toward a solution is applauded, the way this is being done brings along huge risks that takes many people countless hours of useless work to account for which could have been expended elsewhere.
What I feel is surprising in this debate and should be mentioned, is that the (Reddit) bitcoin community at large appears to be prepared to blindly follow Mike/Gavin with little to no technical basis in their reasons of following them other than "moar better transaction blocks things", despite many well-founded arguments many in this space are bringing, and discarding any reasonable scrutiny.

You would need to scan the entire blockchain (actually utxo set) to calculate the aggregate amounts in that address. Bitcoin Core does not keep an index of the balance of every address that exists (Electrum does). It also doesn't provide a handy RPC method which does this for you (because it takes a while and not part of its core functionality).

Miners choose which transactions they admit in the block they are building. They can choose to mine any transaction for free, or only admit transactions with a fee that satisfies their fee policy.
Miners need incentives to stay in business. As the block reward (which currently is the prevalent subsidy that keeps them in bussiness) approaches zero, it will make more sense for them to create and enforce a competitive fee policy other than the default. This could mean fees go sky-high, which would have the side-effect of potentially reduced utility of the network, which, again, would mean less income. It could also mean fees drop to anything-above-zero levels (because it doesn't cost miners anything/much to admit a transaction). There's a balance to be found here, and hopefully a fee market will come into existence that finds this balance.
The recent block size debate, which deals with artificial scarcity of the amount of transactions that can fit in a block, may force such a fee market to exist, or it may complicate the issue further.
It's hard to predict exactly what will happen with transaction fees in the future, because we don't yet know how such a fee market will play out.

Bitcoin-XT includes a patch which can hard-fork the blockchain on (at the earliest) january 11th 2016:
This requires a 'supermajority' of 75% of all miners to agree on this fork and allows blocks to, initially, become 8MB in size rather than 1MB.
The threshold at which this fork of the Bitcoin Core software will allow a fork of the Bitcoin Blockchain to occur is highly controversial and includes only a miner vote (of only 75%!) - nothing at all related to whether or not any nodes are running the software (which, to be honest, would be completely unreliable anyway) and, in some scenario's which are currently unaccounted for, could hugely fragment the network.
The patch that addresses the block size limit is a solution which does not have consensus in the developer community, nor the bitcoin community at large. At this time it would cause a so-called contentious hard fork, which potentially harms the network.

A (very) high number of dishonest nodes could disrupt the network somewhat by making it less likely to automatically connect to honest nodes. If, for example, 90% of previously honest nodes turn malignent, there's a fair chance they can shield you entirely from the honest network. Or if a DNS seed node is compromised and will only seed you dishonest nodes, you'll be shielded from the actual network and you'd be vulnerable to double spends. Given effort, you could be led to believe transactions are happening that aren't actually happening.
Connecting to a single honest node will allow you to reject everything the dishonest nodes are spitting your way and disconnect from them. The single honest node will show you a new best chain you were previously unaware of, and you'll switch to that chain. Along with that it'll seed you a new set of peers it is connected to, and you'll be able to switch to the honest network completely.
However, for you to actually be vulnerable to double spends (assuming you don't accept 0-confs), the malignant parallel network would need to have a very sizeable hashrate which will lead you to believe you are connected to the honest network. (Otherwise you'd see blocks coming in at a rate completely different from what you've seen previously to the point it smells fishy, you can cry wolf and investigate)

Nothing is being blown up here. *Not* retaining all expectations the blockchain ever provided is one of cardinal sins and there is very strong consensus on never making any backward-incompatible changes.




That's probably true; without OP_CLTV, OP_CSV and with malleability still lurking round the corner, how creative you can get is kind of limited. With these opcodes in place - a lot more can happen.
Do you have a link to where luke-jr said this?


Not exactly. Side chains are intended to provide a experimentation testbed using Bitcoin tokens that you can move there and back again. The greatest challenge to any altcoin is getting the network effect, it can have all the features any person could ever desire, but without people to give it some economic significance, it will fail. Sidechains allow people to experiment and test new features with tokens that have actual value. If these features are in line with Bitcoin goals, and can be rolled in - then they might be rolled in. Segregated Witness is one example of this, and perhaps Confidential Transactions later on aswell.
Both of these features were developed and tested on a sidechain that lives on top of Bitcoin Testnet, and both can be soft forked into Bitcoin.


Well. They're mostly looking at Bitcoin and thinking "wow, this can be really good for x, y and z", and then upon further investigation they discover Bitcoin's layer-1 'blockchain' itself is actually really incompatible with all of that - further, because layer-2 is not a concept initially apparent to them they might try to change layer-1 in such a way it does work. Innovators that want to store all of Wikipedia right on the blockchain, store all stock and ownership slips right on the blockchain, use the blockchain for microtransacting, or use it for messaging. Bitcoin is not a store of data, nor is it a high frequency interaction system. The blockchain is, most of the time, suitable for none of the things these innovators want. And this goes for any blockchain - the blockchain is too dumb.
Really clever protocols that use the blockchain, but don't abuse it, like the Lightning Network. These are the protocols that are actually interesting. There haven't been all that many people who have been thinking about building their killer application in this way. Only now, now that Lightning is paving the way toward really smart applications, is innovative thought moving to layer-2.
Reading the lightning white paper was absolutely mind shattering.
Getting back on the topic of this thread, Factom is a smart application concept implemented in a layer-1 line of thought. For it to work, it needs a separate blockchain, a separate token, and its security is quite different from Bitcoin proper. It's clever, but it in the end it's just a set of straight-forward solutions to the limitations of nothing-but-a-blockchain.


It'd be nice to have more capacity to build stuff in this ecosystem. There's a lot of people working on Bitcoin full-time, and they are doing an absolutely fantastic job. But it is a highly complex environment to work in, and it isn't for everyone. Hell, I've been researching this stuff something like 20 hours a week for 2 years now in my spare time and I'm still not even 10% of the way there. Creating something from the ground up takes a lot of effort, and a lot of expertise, and contrary to centralised systems - things will get easier as we get higher.

It's hardly BS, though, nor is it trivial.
The point of bitcoin is to be in control and have control over your money, this includes the responsibility this control entails. There's a reason banks have grown into the behemoths they are today, and they all bear the regulatory pressure imposed by those that use their services; the responsibility required to securely control and own money is huge.
If you are unprepared or unwilling to take this responsiblity then that's fine, but this comes at the cost of putting your trust into someone or something which does this for you; you are dependent on their taking care of your money responsibly.

You realize that if this ever happens it only means the hard cap explodes far faster than the network can scale up. Requiring a miner-enforced soft fork to keep the network from being unworkable means nodes must effectively yield the last shred of control they have on the network.

Mining follows a poisson distribution.
The chance of something happening (finding a block) is the same for a given period of time, or a given set of cycles.
For bitcoin, the network retargets the mining difficulty periodically so that, on average, the time it takes to find a block is roughly 10 minutes (the top of the distribution). But actually finding an individual block may take any length of time, though *not* finding a block becomes increasingly improbable over time.

@_date: 2015-06-14 22:56:45
True, I strategically left that out, you have a keen eye. ;)
I find the argument I gave (creating a full fake chain), which for the current best chain doesn't actually apply, gets the point across the best.
The argument stands, though. If the longest chain were valid I would need to perform much much less work to make the network switch than a best chain. I could cause a 'shielded' difficulty drop at the tip, for example, and work on that chain until my limited hashing power creates a longer chain. Or in the same scenario where I'm creating a full fake chain I could forego all difficulty drops and start all increases at the end, also requiring me to perform much less work, while still ending up at equivalent timestamps.
@_date: 2015-12-28 12:25:20
Short answer: No. Hashrate is completely disconnected from transactional capacity.
Complicated answer: Yes. Block confirmation times are lower when hashrate is trending up. Transactional capacity is higher until the difficulty readjustment every 2016 blocks. But note the network itself doesn't become 'faster' or is more able to 'cope' with the load.

It'll take some years for this whole layer-2 line of thinking to properly flesh out into something tangible and useful, but if this grand experiment works out, then *that's* where the infamous killer apps will be.


I have no idea where we'll be in 10 years; I can hardly see past next tuesday.
But I can tell you where I don't want Bitcoin to be. Most primarily, I want to be able to audit the system in 10 years as easily as I can today; so no scale-ups that requires me to trust some third party auditor conglomerate that tells me what I should be able to tell myself. So long as I, or anyone, can audit this sytem can I be confident to continue using it - will it have utility. So long as it has utility will there be demand for applications on top that can do all manner of things making the system more useful.


If anything can destroy this sytem, it's mindlessly scaling up to solve the problems we are perceiving to have today, with no second thought about tomorrow.
Throwing away all nuance here: it's sentiments perpetuated by the 'keep 0-conf alive', the 'dump the block size limit' and the 'my worthless opinion is being oppressed' crowd that is the greatest challenge to moving Bitcoin forward.

Do you mean a smart protocol and dumb users? :)


If it could do only one thing there would be no need to have an advanced scripting language inside it that allows for smart contracts to run on top. Every peer-to-peer transaction is not just a 'type' of transaction, it's a set of instructions, *code*, which makes the guy you're sending money to spend it.
If peer-to-peer transactions were the only use case for Bitcoin, then having this would be a complete waste of space:
By saying Bitcoin is 'dumb', is not saying it is retarded. It allows for basic operations that, put together in a smart way, allow applications on top to do very complicated things. But Bitcoin itself is not aware of any of those things. It is dumb, because it does all of those things being completely unaware of anything. Bitcoin doesn't even *know* what a peer-to-peer transaction is. All it knows is how to hash a piece of data, and verify a signature - applications *on top* use that functionality to send a peer-to-peer transaction. Same goes for every single proposed and realised protocol on top.
Take chess, the game. Its rules may be explained to a child inside of 15 minutes, but it takes a lifetime to learn all of its intricacies. The game - in and of itself - is dumb, its application is not.


Intentions aren't all that interesting to me, reality is. Reality is that nothing but a simple peer-to-peer payment system where everyone can send money to everyone on a network where everyone does everything will not work for the simple reason that it cannot scale.


I would argue the latter may be achieved by doing the former.


Heh, this is the very problem everyone is talking about, and the vast majority doesn't even know it ;)

R (well, *k*, really) needs to be unique. A wallet cannot guarantee there will never be another spend from an address, so it cannot do SHA256(privkey) and  use it.

Full block verification is skipped for the first 200k blocks or so because the software has built-in checkpoints it's expecting. After that it will fully validate everything for validity; every transaction that has ever occurred and every block that has been generated and included in the chain. It's all checked.
This takes time. And while the process of validating has been highly optimized, and can be more optimized even still, it's gonna take time. Once you've done the initial validation you will only be validating and relaying that which is coming in real-time, which takes much much less processing time; you'll be idle most of the time.

It's in the white paper under risks.
If I understand correctly, (and the last time I skimmed the paper was a few months ago), then essentially, the lightning network needs you to be online all the time. If you disconnect for any reason (reboot, whoopsy failure, house fire, ddos, etc.), then a peer you are channelled with (and tries to steal from you) can broadcast a transaction which sets off a window in which you need to respond, or the money in the channel can be 'reset' to some time in the past and paid out to each participant. (Or something? Will double check later today) The state of the channel in this time in the past may be more favourable to the attacker than the current state.
In this window, you can broadcast a spend immediately, the counterparty needs to wait x days, as per the contract agreed upon.
'Going offline for any reason' can be mitigated by having 3rd party players observe the blockchain and, in case of failure/attack, broadcast your response in your stead before the channel closes, and paying each participant the correct amount of money.
// Edit:




mitigated by having a 3rd party data storage service where encrypted data gets sent to this 3rd
party service which the 3rd party cannot decrypt. Additionally, one should choose channel
counterparties who are responsible and willing to provide the current state, with some
periodic tests of honesty.




This can be mitigated by having a designated 3rd party to send funds. An output fee can be
added to create an incentive for this 3rd party to watch the network. Further, this can also be
mitigated by implementing relative OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.

1) At best it only delays ASIC development. If it's in someone's best interest to make any given process more efficient, you can bet it's gonna happen. Making a process more complex only introduces more methods of optimizing.
2) The reason ASIC-resistance is desirable to some is because some people would prefer if people started mining from home rather than data centers, making the network magnitudes more decentralized. A fine goal, but making the mining algorithm more complex doesn't somehow make home mining more profitable. *Everything* can be done cheaper and more efficiently in data centers, so this is a natural place for mining to move to. Making decentralized ownership possible would benefit the network more in this regard.
3) It's harder to disprove shortcuts in complex algorithms than it is in simple algorithms. Shortcuts allow one to prove the same amount of work, while doing less. Already, some functions of SHA256 can be done more efficiently than normal, which miners are actively making use of (as they should). This doesn't impact mining in the long term because mining is resistant to shortcuts (so long as everyone is doing them), but that doesn't mean we should make it easier for shortcuts to exist.

That is beside the point. Fact is that today businesses depend on it, and we need to acknowledge that. RBF as it exists today makes 0-conf infeasible to accept as payments so long as (even more controversial) practices such as scorched-earth are not adapted. RBF, *now*, is in nobody's best interest. Later.
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:25:02




So long as miners behave in the way we intend (mining on the best chain, for example) does confidence in and security over the past appreciate. If miners turn malicious at any time, the past isn't necessarily affected immediately. Not so for 0-conf. Their honesty in the past adds no forward facing security to accepting 0-conf as final. If miners, at any time, for any reason, adopt RBF, while businesses still assume first-seen policy is still adopted by miners, 0-conf breaks right then and there. Period.
For this reason, it makes sense to me to try and move out of a situation where this is the case for the network as a whole.
I think this contribution by Adam Back to the discussion is very sensible:
If a business is prepared to rely on the network to enforce first-seen policy, that's fine, have transactions be flagged as such and do your thing.
If a business isn't, treat 0-conf with sensible scrutiny, and rely on more robust methods of accepting a transaction (confirmations, trust relations, LN, or if worst comes to worst, SE).
Everyone is happy. Mark as resolved.

Nothing. Anyone can fork and abuse the code and its rules however much they please and try and plug that into the network.
But when they do that and, for example, mine a block which gives them a million bitcoin, the rest of the network will reject and discard their block.
If it's a node which, for example, relays invalid transactions, then those transactions will not be relayed by its honest peers - the invalid transaction will not propagate through the network, and the malignant node will be disconnected from. Even if the transaction reaches a miner which for some reason mines it, the resulting block will be invalid, and, again be rejected and discarded by the entirety of the network.
Only honest behaviour is accepted, because the entirety of the network enforces the agreed-upon rules which define it.

I thought the same when I first perused over SW, I was quickly brought up to speed by the place the witness is stored is an implementation detail.
Besides, whenever pulling a raw transaction out of Core or whatever other implementation, the implementation can simply push the witness into the response, giving you the exact same format you will receive today. The current code in the proposal already does this (and the same happens in the Alpha sidechain implementation).
Existing applications pulling data out of Core need not even change their behaviour except if they are calculating the txid out of the getrawtransaction response (for some reason; this typically isn't needed at all), by, again, segregating the witness out of it.
Bear in mind: the witness/signatures are still there when a transaction/block is transmitted over the wire; they are just in a different location.

Proposals to alter the block size limit are being discussed daily and to great depth. It's implementations thereof and the advocacy of its use *today* that is not being permitted on these centralised media.
@_date: 2015-06-12 20:59:26
First of all, thanks for writing up this proposal.
I have a question.
If miners decide to soft fork into block size limits (assuming network grows / tx rate churns along nicely with the limit) which make it implausible for users to validate the network and blockchain at reasonable prices, their only recourse is to cry wolf here on reddit, the mailing list, irc, bitcointalk, etc., or selling their coins and abandoning any stake in the network.
The block size limit is one of the few places where nodes currently have a strong degree of control over activity in the network. Even though this control immutable without a hard fork; your proposal eliminates it completely.
While I, given reasonable assumptions on how this BIP will play out if accepted, can see this proposal working perfectly fine and aligned with organic network growth, I can also see potentially catastrophic changes in the way users are currently able to fully validate the blockchain and the network at low cost and effort, if average block sizes unacceptable to them were achieved without their having any ability to change this.
How do you think, if at all, to address this?

The second may not be what you expect, but it's a better metric than just 'the number of bitcoins that moved'.
Days destroyed is the number of coins that moved multiplied by the number of days those coins have been sitting idle. Because it's possible to do countless transactions moving coins from A to B back to A to B etc. (in the same block, even), total coin movement is meaningless: days destroyed is more reliable.

Well, the price would plummet, as you say. For a short time.
If someone would do an immediate sell-off regardless of at what price the coins will be selling for (ie. Sell all the way down to 0), then that's what the price will be. 0. Selling this way is a surefire way to lose a bunch of money and it takes a special kind of idiot to do for no reason other than losing money.
So seconds later, the price will shoot up to near-previous levels (a bit under it, because the order book has been emptied and demand temporarily depleted). If there was no reason for this sell-off, meaning previous price levels were justified, then likely not a lot will happen. In fact most traders will clap their hands for the cheap coin they got.
So long as people see value in bitcoin there will be demand. An early adopter offloading doesn't make the system any less valuable, it just temporarily affects price.
The real price killer you should worry about, if you're into that kinda thing, is confidence users have in the system. Loss of confidence decreases demand, which can really plummet prices in a way it's more permanent, especially if this loss of confidence is justified.

Bittorrent is a file sharing protocol. It works great for files that do not change, not a record which continually expands.
Further, Bittorrent is actually, for a large part, centralized into 'trackers' which maintain and coordinate communication between peers. Essentially, you have to trust the tracker. Things like DHT mitigate this a bit, but nowhere near the way Bitcoin does it.
Bitcoin (Core), by design, trusts nothing. Through various methods (DNS seeds, hard-coded IPs or manually added peers) it widely connects to the network, and everything it receives from those peers will be handled as though the peer is malignant. The goal here is to not have even a shred of trust anywhere in the pipeline. Bittorrent can't give us that.
Let alone the heaps of added flexibility bitcoin's sharing protocol provides, such as SPV, proposed IBLT changes, time synchronization, bloom filters, connection 'widening' (if that's a word, being able to find and connect to more and new peers) and whatever else you can think of.

You can only "lose" a scriptsig the same way you can "lose" a transaction.
Don't think of a block as a colossal piece of data, think of it as 80 bytes of data in which some more data is committed. It's been this way since the start, and SW doesn't change a thing here: all data contained within a block, is committed to in the merkle root. Furthermore, all the rest of the blockchain, is committed to in the prevblock header.
Witnesses are committed to in the coinbase, the coinbase is part of the merkle tree, the root of which lives in the block headers. As such, losing a witness has equivalent implications as losing a transaction does.

1. You have to monitor the blockchain 100% of the time.
2. You have funds (private keys) readily available on an internet-connected device.
The former's risks that will present themselves when you *don't* do this (because outages, DDoS, etc.) can be mitigated when SW (anti-malleability) kicks in, which would allow you to delegate monitoring of the blockchain to some third party.
The latter is a fundamental downside, though it should be noted a machine can quite easily be made plenty secure.

similar situation as average users, so again, this means very little to
Many (most) businesses currently depend on first-seen policy. They don't expect transactions to be double-spent and actually be included in a block. In a way, they trust the network to enforce this policy, and they account for the 'stray' double-spends that wiggle through the seams in their margins. That's not ideal, but that's how it is now.
While business probably need to move away from depending on the network to enforce this policy anyway, that's not what it looks like today.
This patch allows all double-spends for unconfirmed transactions with higher fees to be included in the next block, rather than the first-seen transaction. Effectively, this allows *everyone* to *steal* from *anyone that depends on first-seen policies* at hugely appreciated odds.
So how, I wonder, does this mean "very little" to businesses?

Equivalently, coins that are itching to be sold OTC and now won't, will be sold either way. If not OTC, then on the exchanges, causing, by your logic, "prices to plummet".

25 (reward) * 144 (blocks per day) = 3600 BTC daily


That's assuming all of those newly mined bitcoin are immediately sold, but essentially, yes. ~0.85 million USD worth of bitcoin is introduced to the ecosystem daily.


The halving will cut new coin supply in half, whether or not this changes (reduces) the amount of new coins that hit the market remains to be seen, but probably yes.


There's some more variables. People sell existing coins for a number of reasons other than coin supply.
You'd be precisely correct if all of the newly generated coins are immediately sold, and if everyone holding/saving bitcoin will never sell their coins. Neither of which is exactly the case.
But essentially, yes, the halving will most probably decrease the amount of USD value that needs to be added to the ecosystem to sustain the same price level. (Which, assuming equal demand, will mean the price will rise). Do note that's not a guarantee, a multitude of other reasons could cause the price to crash or spike before or after the halving.

So this is why we have built-in economic incentives for the intended behaviour and an exceedingly stingy disincentive for the opposite (wasting precious resources with nothing to shoe for it). If this were ever replaced by incentives to the opposite, we'll end up with a useless network, and the bitcoin experiment will have failed. That's true enough.

I like to think of it this way; in the current financial system, those running the system (mediators such as banks, payment providers and governments) need to actively *expand* the borders of the system in order to include people the same way 'we, the rich folk in the developed world' are included. Expanding borders this way takes effort and is very inefficient.
I tend to think of it as a circle, increasing the radius of a circle increases the circle's surface exponentially. The analogue being; radius = scale of economy, surface = effort to maintain it.
This is fine, but only so long as you are part of the group that may consider themselves 'rich developed world folk'. Only so long as you are inside the 'circle'. Currently about 6 billion people are excluded, and it would take tremendous effort to expand the circle such that they are included.
To most of us here (seeing that the demographic here relative to the world's average is 'developed world rich folk') bitcoin may be perceived as unnecessary. Sure.
But in bitcoin and other (decentralized) systems, people (all of 'em) are given the power to *include themselves* in the system, without the system approving or disapproving that inclusion. For an economy that needs to exist at scale, I believe this is the only viable way to exist fairly to all; control over inclusion in the economy is given to the people, rather than those that facilitate it (rather, those participating themselves facilitate it).

TL;DR - Bitcoin addresses are case sensitive.
Bitcoin addresses employ a Base58 encoding scheme, meaning they encode a string of bits in a 58-character set. It is basically the same as the Base64 character set, except some characters that seem the same are left out, namely the 0 (zero), O (capital o), I (capital i) and l (lower case L) (and also the / and the +) .
If you make a typo when sending money to a bitcoin address, it is highly likely (read: insanely likely approaching the point of certainty) that it is an invalid address. This is because a bitcoin address also contains a checksum of the underlying 160-bit hash (of a 256-bit hash) of the public key. Even though having to copy a bitcoin address manually almost never happens in practice since you'll use a QR-code, NFC, a hyperlink or whatever else we come up with; adding a checksum to the address makes it much safer to make small errors, because your wallet software will figure out the address is invalid, informing you of this fact. In other words, even if you make a typo, you will not lose money.

Mining is not profitable at a small scale. It is definitely not profitable on personal computers.

Forks are changes in the rules defined by the bitcoin protocol.
I like to explain this by taking the speed limit on a highway as an analogy.
Let's say the speed limit is 130 Km/h, which is written like so:
    Vehicles on the highway must not move in excess of 130 km/h
or in code:
    if(speed &gt; 130) {
          throw IllegalSpeedException(); // Vehicle in question is 'invalid' and in non-compliance with the rules
    }
This is a rule everyone driving on the highway agrees on and is aware of.
The participants on the road are the police (miners) and people (nodes). They both do the same things: move in compliance with the rules and validate if everyone else is doing the same, but the police will also validate everyone joining this road to see if they are in compliance with the rules that exist for the road; whether they are aware of the speed limit.
It follows, that if the police all of the sudden will only allow for people who believe the speed limit is, say, 90 km/h rather than the current 130 km/h, on this road, that this will be the de-facto speed limit that exists for the road. The rule which says the speed limit must be *below* 130 km/h, enforced by people, is satisfied regardless. This is known as a **soft fork**, it *restricts existing rules* further, and it can be enforced by miners only.
If the police / miners want to *increase* the speed limit to, say, 150 km/h, then they can certainly try. But in order for this to work then all people / nodes that participate on the road must also agree with this *new* rule which *expands* the scope it encompassed originally. A speed of 150 km/h *does not* satisfy the original speed limit rule of 130 km/h. This is known as a **hard fork**, it *expands existing rules*, and it requires all participants to be in agreement of the new rules.
Changes to the codebase which require nothing are changes which change no rule, only the way in which they are implemented. For example, the way digital signatures are validated in recent versions through libsecp256k1 yields us a 5x performance increase while validating the blockchain, but it changes not a single rule.

You are correct in saying there is not much point in using bitcoin right now if you have a credit card, debit card, somewhat reliable bank or government regulation applied to it, and all the convenience that comes with security of cash.
If you don't have any or all of that, though, bitcoin can give it to you without anyone telling you you can't have it.
Also, if you *do* have all of that, bitcoin has the potential to improve and reinvent all of it. Let me put an emphasis on **all of it**. Bear in mind that all this has not been put into practice yet, it's being worked on and thought about as we speak by dozens of groups, companies and communities.
Right now, the people that are so interested in bitcoin and are saying things like "it'll replace the dollar" are all dreamers. They dream about all the ways several aspects of bitcoin such as its programmability, its irreversible ledger, its massive computing power, may be put to use practically, and how they may improve upon the current situation of our financial infrastructure and otherwise.
But we're not there yet, and it'll take some doing to create all this. Give it time.

Many changes to the protocol can be realized fairly painlessly to everyone involved. Some changes require a hard fork.
Those changes, the ones that fundamentally change something in the way communication over the bitcoin network is interpreted, would be 'damn near impossible' to do. Yes. But still, not impossible. It would require a great amount of coordination with miners, users, protocol implementations, pretty much everything related to the network. Everything'd have to be tested, retested and tested again after changes have been implemented, and before the actual protocol change is 'live'. It'd be a tremendous effort. But possible nonetheless.
Think of a change like this to be comparable to the Y2K bug. A widely spread implementation change due to a reasonably 'small' 'bug/feature' that could've been fixed much much earlier, affecting an incredible amount of systems.
This is why effort on building the protocol so early on is (and has been) so important, thinking of all the implications, thinking of all the potential, thinking of the future that is yet so far away. This is why we, adopters, developers, lurkers, hodlers, redditors, trolls and geniuses, must support development. This is why bitcoin is (even still) an experiment that should remain so until the protocol is strong and the software and all that it does is no longer considered 'young'. A moment we are fast approaching.

You can send the transaction without a fee, but it'll take *a long time* for that transaction to confirm on the network, if ever. Eligius is a mining pool that *may* accept transactions without a fee, they mine a block every few hours or so. (See: 
There is no way to 'merge' wallets without a transaction. In fact, there's no way to move coins without the network knowing about it (or rather, the network does not acknowledge you've tried to move coins if you didn't broadcast a transaction saying they move, thus, the coins haven't moved because the network agrees they haven't).
// Edit: Looking at the other comment I may have misinterpreted the question: Yes, it's possible to import multibit's wallet/private keys into Bitcoin-QT. You'll still have multiple addresses, but that's not a problem.

By referencing the Pedersen-chain's amount-obscured (assuming immaleable) tx id in a legacy Bitcoin-chain transaction through an OP_RETURN output, along with whatever legacy outputs you so desire. But this would be 2 transactions..
So then... Instead of a tx id, sticking a Pedersen commitment (+ source?) in the OP_RETURN output will let you have it all in one tx on the Bitcoin-chain.
Going on a limb here -- if the Pedersen-chain were to acknowledge these outputs and only allow transactions for outputs that have been referenced/committed to from the Bitcoin-chain, then the Pedersen transaction need not even be broadcast until some later date when needed (the peg back to Bitcoin), if ever or at all.

There's very strong reasons that Austrians don't use mathematical models in economics: economics is the study of human interaction, humans act through their faculties of reason, and reason is the speculation of future events wherein human action is the proactive response to these speculations.
Mathematical models are _re_active, like the natural sciences. Economics, on the contrary, is a social science.

Correct, it's psuedonymous.


If you lose your phone (or private key) and you do not have a backup they will immutably sit in the blockchain for all of eternity.


Frankly, a centralized web wallet is the most convenient (for parents and the like, they'll be most familiar with it), but it is **not** safe and is *missing the point of bitcoin*, and I **cannot** in good faith recommend it to anyone.
Check out this to make up your mind: 


You can consider this impossible. The private key space is 2^256, the address space is 2^160, both of those numbers are so large it's impossible that, by chance, the same key is generated. It's physically impossible to build a machine that can even count to this number.
But if it were to happen, it'll be a race for a confirmation. One of them will be included in a block, the other discarded. The distributed consensus system powering bitcoin does not allow double spends in its ledger.

Well, the problem with the graphene proposal specifically was that they theorize about IBLTs with txid based ordering, which is a hard fork proposal with many disadvantages (because you only discover that a block is invalid after having validated each transaction, instead of immediately when you encounter an invalid transaction such as today, because as a result of this hard fork, transaction validation is no longer synchronous from the consensus perspective, which is an anti-feature).
There can be canonical orderings that are uncontroversial, soft forks, and with benefits for things like filters and commitments, but those are just not compatible with graphene, which requires the ordering to be on txid in its proposed best case that it was showcasing, which the authors for some reason did not seem to realize.

The network adjusts/retargets the difficulty every 2016 blocks so the block confirmation time is, again, 10 minutes on average.
Put simply:
More miners -&gt; higher hashrate -&gt; more 'work' in a given time period -&gt; faster block confirmations
Less miners -&gt; lower hashrate -&gt; less 'work' in a given time period-&gt; slower block confirmations
Every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks), the difficulty is adjusted so the amount of work performed by the network, in a time period of 10 minutes, is equal to the amount of work *roughly* required to generate a block.

Ideally you'd be using an HD wallet, especially for consumer-facing transactions (or rather, deterministic addresses as described in BIP32 -  HD wallets don't reuse addresses, improving your privacy greatly, and it's much easier to back-up/secure.
Ie. if you have 1 address for donations, someone could easily see how many donations you receive. Similarly if you have 1 address for people buying your stuff, someone could easily see how often you sell stuff.
Whether you want to use 1 address for things like that is up to you **and the people sending you bitcoin**; reusing addresses impacts privacy your customers may value, meaning they may not want to send to reused addresses.

Yeah nah, users were for the most part against the *2000%* block size limit increase proposed in that hard fork. Even at the time, when common understanding of how these networks operate and function was far worse off than it is now.
Consensus is not measured by miner hashrate. Obviously miners would _want_ bigger blocks, it'd give them more power because bigger blocks lead to hashrate centralisation. The fact that they would want this (or ought to) is actually a huge indicator that the thing concerned needs more scrutiny.
The XT people nor any of its allied groups _never_ addressed this objection beyond "miners are benevolent angels" which clearly, aprioristically aswell as empirically, is just false.

Andreas has a way with words that leave most that hear him talking about bitcoin amazed. Sure. He understands it. Yes, of course. But is he the only one that does? Shit no, people all over understand bitcoin fully. They don't or won't explain it (as) publicly, but you can be damned sure they'll do it to anyone that's even remotely listening privately. Others don't have the time or patience to explain it that simply or they don't care about it (actually, for good reason, it's cumbersome to explain it to a layperson time and time again). They'll contribute to bitcoin application, adoption, implementation and improvement to a much greater extent instead.
Point being, Andreas, by far, is not the only one that understands bitcoin as good, and that ton of people is able to explain *all* of its major dependencies simply.

Allow me to quote something relating to the issue you're referring


While I disagree with the way this patch works and was deployed - blocking explicit addresses and enabling it by default, it was never meant to be a permanent solution to the *'problem'* it mitigates.
As for what you're saying here:


If some miners want to blacklist/block those addresses, by all means, let them. I nor anyone else but them should have control over what they want to put in their block.
Implementing this patch for practical reasons (ie. not being bothered by this 'problem') does not mean no work is being done to fix it.

Multisignature transactions, HD wallets, reliably buying and selling bitcoin, hundreds of exchanges rather than one, buying beer at the local bar, paying bills with bitcoin, tipping, buying stuff on overstock, amazon and a ton of other merchants with bitcoin.

Bitcoin remittances knock WU remittances out of the ballpark when you exclude entering and exiting Bitcoin &lt;&gt; USD.

Seeing that tips can be extremely small, transaction fees (relative to the tip amount) are quite large. (for a 100 bit tip, you'd end up paying 10 bits for the transaction fee).
For this reason, changetip aggregates the tip amounts in your account until you manually withdraw it.
It is, however, desirable if changetip were to decentralize their service by implementing micro payments channels in some way. This way the possibility of them running away with the aggregate amount of bitcoin they're holding is eliminated.

Say GHash will not agree to a future feature change (a change in the protocol, let's say it's using SHA-3 digests as the mining/hashing algorithm rather than SHA256, because some theoretical SHA256 weakness has been discovered). They want to stick to SHA256. Users / people transacting in bitcoin will want to move to SHA-3 because it's a bit more secure. And no compromise can be reached.
A fork will be created in the blockchain, most users and many miners will move to the (much more profitable) SHA-3 fork, transactions will take (much) longer to confirm while we're waiting for the difficulty to drop to a proper target, but all will be well reasonably soon after that. GHash will then be sitting on a chain that will devaluate quickly and realize their mistake.
Of course, a feature change like this would be well-coordinated and it'd be very unlikely to happen like this - effectively orphaning half the miners. Miners would realize quite soon it'd be best to adopt a wise change that users prefer so long as they remain profitable, but in the end - network users will win (within reasonable limits).

In the core code (and the protocol) the amounts bitcoin is dealing with are all integers; satoshi's. It's contained in an 8 byte value. So without changing the protocol we can't add 'decimal places'.
The protocol change would be (I think) a different transaction format version (2) that allows for higher amount values (say, 16 byte). All previous transaction amounts would essentially be translated to have a bunch of zeroes appended to the end. It wouldn't be that complex a change, although it would be a hard fork, all software implementations dealing with it, wallets, exchanges, administrative, etc. would need to change aswell (which for proper implementations would be not much harder than changing a few constants for this transaction version). Please, anyone correct me if I'm wrong here.

A BTC unit is just a number. The smallets unit being 0.00000001 Bitcoin, also called 1 satoshi. It's not made of anything. It doesn't have a 'theoretical' 21 million BTC limit, it doesn't have a magical formula explaining its existence, it has no properties other than the quantity of the number. The bitcoin currency unit itself is not special at all.
What makes it special is that it is the only unit used in the 'bitcoin network'. The 'bitcoin network' and the 'bitcoin unit' are often both referred to as bitcoin, which causes a lot of confusion:
- The bitcoin unit is a number.
- The bitcoin payment network is a distributed network using the unit.
The bitcoin payment network maintains a ledger, the ledger being a record of the *order* of all transactions inside the network. The *order* is determined by *mining*. Mining is a process that takes work (work costs power and time), this work is rewarded with bitcoin units that can be used in the network. The 'coinbase' is the first transaction in a block, which is a transaction that creates bitcoin units out of thin air. This way, mining has a secondary function of minting the currency.
When you *send* bitcoin, what you're really doing is broadcast a transaction which defines what it takes to spend the bitcoin units. A transaction is defined by inputs and outputs:
- Inputs are previous transactions' outputs, along with a 'script' that proves you are allowed to spend the previous outputs.
- Outputs are made of an amount, and a 'script' that describes what conditions must be met, in order for 'the next guy' to spend the output.
The 21 million BTC limit is a limit consented to by the network; the total number of bitcoin units rewarded in the coinbase transactions shall never exceed 21 million because the network has consensus that it never will. In *theory*, this limit could be changed, it would only require consensus in the network. But because there's no incentive to do this and would likely destroy the system, this is not going to happen. If it does happen, it will not be because of *fractional reserve banking*, but because the network agrees it is the best way forward.
This all may seem very technical, I tried to explain it as simply as I could without dumbing it down too much like many advert video's do. It's worth it to investigate and learn more. ;) Check the wiki for more information:
Good luck!

Think of bitcoin like cash.
Suppose you have a 5 dollar bill in your pocket, and you want to give me 1 dollar. How would you do this? Do you rip the bill apart and give me a fifth?
No, you give me 5 dollars, and I give you 4 dollars in change. In bitcoin it's very similar.
You have a 5BTC output which you can spend. When you compose a transacation spending that you must consume the entirety of that output; so you take that 5BTC as input to your transaction, create an output which gives me 1BTC, and another which gives yourself 4BTC.
The 5BTC output you had ownership over previously has been spent, and can never be spent again, only the new 4BTC  and 1BTC outputs you created as a result of spending the 5BTC can be spent (by you and me, respectively).
'Tis the wonder that is the blockchain; the agreed upon public ledger which contains any and all transaction that have ever occured, maintained and validated by all who participate. There is not a single output in there which has been spent twice.

I'm not sure what you're asking..
If you're referring to the side chains proposal, the idea is you can move value between chains without affecting bitcoin's fixed supply. Yes.
It also enables you to get your bitcoin back by leaving the 'side chain' and coming back home.
It's a very interesting proposal to say the least, mostly, I think, because it enables frictionless innovation on top of a robust blockchain, without having to create an altcoin. In that sense alone it'd be a huge improvement to bitcoin.
But side chains are not introduced to bitcoin yet and it will take some time to reach consensus or a working implementation.
You can also make some amount of bitcoin provably unspendable, destroying it, keeping the value in the chain but making it stay idle forever. This also leaves the fixed supply unaffected, and in fact would make all left-over bitcoin more valuable, if even by a tiny amount.
--- 
Actually, no matter what you do to the blockchain, its fixed value will always remain unaffected.

The timestamp is often used as a way to expand the 'nonce' header. After each hash of a block header, the nonce is incremented (or otherwise changed) in order for a hash of the headers that have no different values (no additional transactions and no different timestamp) to have a different hash value.
The nonce header is only 4 bytes long, which a modern miner can exhaust in under a second, in order to expand on this value, the timestamp header is 'abused'. If the timestamp value range is exhausted (only a couple of hours, so 60 * 60 * 2 (* 1000?, not sure if it's in milliseconds or seconds) or so values), the coinbase transaction (first transaction in a block) may be used to expand the nonce even further (doing this will change the merkle root header value).

For the past week or so, selling pressure &gt; buying pressure, so the price goes down, slowly.
Traders come in and realize there isn't gonna be another big price bubble in the foreseeable future, so they sell -&gt; boom - crash.
Then, traders and hodlers buy -&gt; boom - correction, and we're stable yet again at a lower price.
Then, miners hodl moar coins because it's not profitable to sell, then there's more buying pressure than there is selling pressure.
And thennnn? The cycle continues in reverse.

The most important cryptography in bitcoin is SHA-256 (hashing) and ECDSA (signatures). There's also RIPEMD (hashing) which provides additional security between public key and public address.
If ECDSA is broken/cracked, all transactions to addresses *that have already been used* will be compromised and can be readily stolen (when you send a transaction, you expose your public key). Seeing that we're moving to HD addresses and are actively implementing software that doesn't reuse addresses, it's likely we'll not re-use an address anymore in the short-term. ECDSA being broken by itself is therefore not a single point of failure (anymore).
If SHA-256 is broken, nothing is compromised, because you'll still need to break ECDSA and RIPEMD.
If RIPEMD is broken, nothing is compromised, because you'll still need to break SHA-256 and ECDSA.
If all three are broken, the entire protocol is compromised.
If at any time any of the three algorithms are broken, we can replace them with some effort and consensus.
As for mining, the difficulty is adjusted every 2 weeks and this can be scaled up approaching infinity; regardless of the power of the network (it could be 2^128 times stronger than today and still work fine). We may however want to change the mining algorithm (proof-of-work, also using SHA-256) to an algorithm where *shortcuts* are theoritically disproven (I'm not sure if there are any).

Strictly seen, we all have the power to change bitcoin 'code'. In practice, it's a consensus based system, which means we all move forward together in agreement, or we split ways, or we don't move at all.
Note that bitcoin is not just 'code'; it is a protocol with various independent implementations. Like HTTP, or TCP, or NFC, or any other protocol, there is no single piece of code that defines the rules because the rules are defined in a protocol, which may be implemented by a piece of code.
If you're referring to Bitcoin Core code ( the reference client for the protocol, maintained by a number of Bitcoin Core Developers; they have the power to change its code, which is just one implementation of the protocol. They, however, do not have power over changes to the protocol, because in order for those changes to take effect in the netwerk, the network needs to be in consensus.
As for your last question: Yes. The 21 million bitcoin may be changed if the network is in agreement this change is positive. The consensus right now and in the future as far as we can see is that such a change would destroy the network, so it's not gonna change just by pressing a button.

Having followed Gavin's work and opinions in Bitcoin, there have been many occasions where even I, as a technical yet by no means expert observer to this grand spectactle, have been able to detect profound and consistent flaws in his reasoning about this technology aswell as its economy. Continually, he handwaves away sound money aspects as though it is mere detail. He bears little regard to privacy, fungibility, even immutability, of this system. His definition of "what is Bitcoin" is broken beyond belief, hinging it on miner majority hashrate. He has historically supported all the wrong forks, all the wrong BIPs (BIP12, BIP16, BIP101, BIP70) for all the wrong reason. Hell, the talk his team gave at the last Scaling conference (the one about IBLTs, his wet dream) was so obviously broken (it required deterministic transaction ordering, which as every Bitcoin dev should know would prevent spends of an output in the same block, since validation is, for consensus purposes, a synchronous process) that it was an embarrassment not only to his team but to the entire conference that platformed this moron.
Gavin no longer being at the wheel of the reference client, and losing his reputation and influence, is the best thing to have happened to Bitcoin since satoshi unleashed it upon the world.

Bitcoin is not inherently more stable than any fiat currency. Contrary to fiat currencies, however, several aspects of bitcoin are more *reliable*, such as the inflationary curve.
In an ideal world as banks and governments imagine it to be, a central authority continually adjusts the supply of money in order for the value of a single unit of currency to remain the same. In reality, the supply is continually adjusted to more positively suit those that are in control of supplying it. Which is of course a monetary system easily corruptible and not economically viable.
Bitcoin offers a degree of certainty to the monetary supply and allows everyone using it to depend on this certainty.
The pricing of bitcoin, given time, approaches how the market perceives it to be, which also happens with all fiat currencies. The main difference is there is no central authority that can dilute currency valuation by having control of the money supply.

Multisignature transactions work like this:
You define a transaction saying that *m* of the *n* keys in a multi-sig pool must be present in order for the transaction output to be spendable.
For example, a 2-of-3 transaction would require 2 out of 3 signatures in order for someone to create a spendable transaction that would move the funds. There's no need to implement physical redundancy because it is inherent to the protocol.

This sounds to me like the same sort of discovery mechanism that runs the internet. I'm not sure if it'd work reliably for bitcoin, though.
Node A saying to node B: "I'm looking for 123.123.321.321 and I'd like to send it [payload]"
Node B doesn't know where it is, but it does know a node (C) that knows where 123.123.\*\*\*.\*\*\* is, so it forwards it there.
Node C doesn't know where it is, but it does know a node (D) that knows where 123.123.321.\*\*\* is, so it forwards it there.
Node D knows where the final IP is (E), and forwards it there.
Node E handles the request and it goes back to node A the same way with a response.
The same thing could be implemented in bitcoin, with nodes storing block hashes starting with some random bits (well, hash of the hash or something rather, seeing that all block hashes start with 0000's) and employing the same discovery method.
But I'm not entirely sure I like it, seeing that bad actors can perform low-cost attacks by running a ton of nodes, also you'd likely be seeing 'supernodes' emerge.

It started off as primarily a Bitcoin XT sub (in .. I wanna saaayyy .. late 2015? About half a year after the scaling wars began in earnest), which was a hard fork client that proposed a miner majority hard fork in I guess early 2016. The promotion for running the _code_ of that client was heavily moderated away on the r/bitcoin sub, because it was considered (rightfully in my opinion) to be an altcoin (a hard fork by definition is an altcoin from the perspective of the status quo / in-consensus client).
Ever since, many people that were at the time promoting Bitcoin XT shifted their focus from the pretense of solving the scaling problem (at least in earnest, their naive solution of just raising the block size was and is rejected by large swaths of the technical community, and others with any sense -- for very good reasons relating primarily to centralization of the means of validation) of Bitcoin, to just hating what they perceive is the dictatorship of r/bitcoin and Bitcoin Core over Bitcoin.
Over the years, they've gone from Bitcoin XT, to Bitcoin Unlimited, to Bitcoin Classic, back to Bitcoin Unlimited, to now primarily Bitcoin Cash.
In that sub, BCH, and all the other alternative clients and coins (that all have a very, at least in my opinion, irresponsible scaling philosophy - that I could go into but won't at this point), are popular because they find in it an outlet to their hatred of 'Core'.

No. For every hash you run over a block (header) there's a small but specific *chance* that block will end up being valid. You can approximate the time at which it is expected a block has been mined (note: not the same as *will be mined*), but there are no guarantees because the process of mining is not deterministic. It is a process which, by design, involves chance.

In fact the way such transactions are confirmed are the exact same as all other transactions. They are not instant and cannot be considered as such.
The difference is that as a receiver of 2-of-2 payments you can be more confident the transaction will not be double-spent (depending on your confidence in the party providing the co-sign), therefore you can be more confident that exact transaction will be confirmed on the blockchain, and you will receive your money.

Work can be defined as a function of *time * energy*. A PoW algorithm attempts to accurately express the time variable by retargeting the energy variable depending on the variances in time that have occurred in the past. 
The work in Bitcoin's PoW could be expressed as *hashes per second*. Hashes being a representation of energy. Computing a hash consumes real-world resources (electricity). Because real world resources are being consumed you have 'something at stake' in achieving distributed consensus. If consensus is not achieved through this algorithm, the resources you have consumed will have been wasted. Because of this, there is a huge incentive to achieve consensus.
A PoS algorithm consumes nothing. Therefore there is nothing at stake. If consensus is not achieved you will have lost nothing, so there is no incentive to achieve consensus.

Any of these options spring to mind:
1) You provide 2 public keys you've generated yourself in whatever way you prefer, which the wallet implementation will use to set up your wallet. You'll never see the wallet's private key and they'll never see your 2 private keys. (I don't think this is what most wallets would do though, they'd go for option 2 for convenience)
2) You generate 2 private keys in some client-side implementation provided by the wallet (javascript if it's a web wallet, or otherwise client-side generation in android, iOS or some desktop app). Which is more convenient and just as safe assuming the code that does it is open-source and has been verified to do what it says it's doing.
Here's another variation which I really like, used by GreenAddress:
2-of-2 multi-sig, one key of yours, another of GreenAddress. Spending any money you receive is encumbered by either those 2 keys, or your key + some number of blocks after the transaction has been confirmed. So if GreenAddress somehow implodes and disappears for whatever reason, you'll still be able to move your funds after some amount of time without their key.

Bitcoin script is just a stack language that is used to define which conditions must be met in order for a transaction to be spendable. The script consists of opcodes that represent actions such as verifying if a signature is valid, pushing data on and off the stack, if/else constructs amd simple stuff like that. It makes for a very flexible way in which we can define the conditions that must be met in order for the money to be moved.

The protocol defines behavior such as the halving, the difficulty adjustments, transaction and block formats and rules, and opcode functions.
This incident here is a pretty nice example: 
The protocol defines transaction output amounts may never exceed its input amounts. But due to a bug in the client software, adding 2 massive output values would overflow an integer such that the resulting summed output amount for a transaction would be negative. At this point the client software would conclude the transaction is valid (summed output &lt; summed input == true), even though the negative output amount was due to an error in addition.

Yes, your question is entirely valid, and so are your concerns.
It's very possible having to relay *and* validate ***and*** store every transaction in the bitcoin network will not scale (very far) into the future. I'm pretty confident we'll be able to handle it for the next few years or so with absolutely no problems, but who knows the state we're in after that. 
Sure, we have Moore's law on our side; it might stretch the lengths at which we can keep on scaling up, but the pressure on the network may very well explode unexpectedly, and not everyone in the ecosystem may be able to handle that. (Bitcoin will survive though, but the battlefield will have rid itself of the smaller contributors, as you indicate). This is why scalability is such an important discussion to have right now.
I, for one, believe we would be wise to further research and prototype concepts that take the blockchain into 'the second dimension' (at the risk of sounding cheesy); whether it's realistic to segregate responsibility of securing, storing and communicating on the network to the peers that participate inside it, but without breaking majority consensus.
Luckily, great work is being done in this field. Side chains are a good step (although I'm not sure about merged mining / reducing main chain security, and any sidechain may still grow arbitrarily large without having fixed any scaling problems), and so are Treechains (although I don't understand how block rewards and submitting proofs to parent chains would work, plus all we've seen so far is a draft paper)

I haven't seen that much negativity ejected toward Coinbase in all honesty.
And I also can't really name a whole lot of things that make Coinbase and Circle so different; they are both centralized exchanges that most people use to buy their way into bitcoin and should both be treated as such.
As for their usability: they're both simple as fuck. I couldn't imagine anyone having trouble using their platform, they hold you by your hand every step of the way and there isn't much that can go wrong. They both do a fine job as far as I can see, even for regulated exchanges.
Just remember not to stash all of your bitcoin on either of them. ;)

Mining a block scales extremely well because you do not hash *all* transactions, but only the 'merkle root' (along with all the other block headers), which is a hash of all transactions and of a fixed length (256 bit).
Therefore, no, you could theoretically have 100MB blocks containing millions of transactions and have it all mined/secured (whether that's actually secure is another question entirely, but short answer: no) by a single 10-year-old-pentium-2 computer; the length of the headers is fixed, meaning the amount of data to hash/mine is the same whether it's a 100MB block or a block with no transactions.

The sim card is an extremely limited IC, it can do simple things like return things when asked for. It could run signing software, but it could not run a wallet.
A wallet needs to do a lot of sort-of complicated processing which a sim card is not outfitted to do. Processing all transactions and updating the balance: hard. Signing a transaction before broadcast: simple.
So, a SIM card would be an excellent medium to store the private keys on and it could be used to sign transactions. The phone itself would manage the wallet, and inquire the sim card only when a payment needs to be made, thereby moving all required security to the sim card and making the phone more secure to private key theft.
So yes, a SIM card, or at least its basic principles - like moving secure operations and storage to an isolated component - could be very useful in bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-08-17 19:08:44
Sure, we can only rely on the sim card if the source code that's running it is available to us. If a bitcoin transaction signing application were running on it, this would most likely be the case.
As for the the underlying platform that's running the application; it's a Java OS, I'm not too familiar with using this myself, but I'm quite sure this is verifiably secure.
Access to an application or its function running on a sim card could only be made available at the discretion of the application, so assuming the OS is secure  this is trivial.

In order to overcome this hurdle, we need solutions to having people use bitcoin without them having to know it. Much like we all use Linux, HTTP, WiFi, internal combustion engines and any such goodness multiple times a day without really knowing it.
Circle is only the first step of the way; it lets people do things the way they are used to - using a credit card and using their own currency denominations, but with bitcoin underneath.
What will ultimately be the solution.. wouldn't know. But we are the army working on it and we're gonna come up with the solution sooner rather than later.

There's an important distinction to make here; the difference between the implementation of a protocol, and the protocol.
Most, if not all, incidents that have occurred on the bitcoin network ( were caused by flaws or bugs in the *implementation* of the protocol. The reason these bugs caused some limited harm or interruption to the network as whole (such as some forks, or the DoS attacks) was because in the early days (and to some extent, currently aswell) the network was operated by a single protocol implementation, namely bitcoin-qt/bitcoind/bitcoin core.
Now that more implementations, or more variations of single implementations, are starting to pop up, it's becoming less and less likely that all of them are vulnerable to a single implementation flaw. Meaning, the protocol definition is better represented in the network, rather than *a* protocol definition as implemented by a single piece of software which may contain bugs or flaws that are, in the end, inevitable.
This is why it's important to have multiple variations of protocol implementations hooked into the network, rather than a single one.

Many people use exchanges to trade bitcoin with fiat to make money, like stock markets. Those people had large sums of money stored on MtGox.
Others were just too lazy to create a wallet or some cold storage measures and trusted MtGox to hold their bitcoin securely, which of course is a terrible mistake, completely defeating the security bitcoin provides.
By using an  exchange the way you describe; buy bitcoin with fiat and get the hell out, you'd be pretty safe.

Gold coins were made thinner and thinner in the roman empire, starting off at about 50 coins in a pound of gold, up to about 75 coins in a pound of gold. Then they started debasing silver coins, dipping essentially a bronze coin in a pool of silver and calling it a silver coin, and they were making those thinner aswell. They also messed around with how many silver coins are equal in value to a gold coin, and how many bronze coins are equal to a silver coin. Funny little scheme's like that happened again and again, everywhere and anywhere.
That is how inflation happened back in the good old days. That is how they turned a precious metal enjoying the benefits of scarcity into fiat.

This is an introduction of proprietary software (.class/.dex files, in this case) into an Android OS. It has nothing to do with a SIM card.
While introducing a backdoor into an OS in this fashion is a very legitimate threat to private information and processing, it will not go unnoticed, and it will not be accepted.
In this case, what's required for this type of malware/spyware/software to be present is trust in the party that has created the phone, Samsung. They're free to add whatever software they like to an android distribution, they could be more open about it but that's not a requirement. If the introduced proprietary software would be used to our disadvantage, which I've seen no evidence or possibility of, that would be a bad business model for a company their size. Whether or not the software *could* be used to our disadvantage can be checked, but it takes some effort.
Regardless, your worries are valid, but they are solvable by relying only on distributions that are verifiably free of any tampering by any party other than yourself. By verifiably I mean you can do a simple checksum of the distribution or compile it yourself, like AOSP.

It's not an issue.
While it may take 10+ minutes for a miner to mine a block that includes a transaction, the time it takes to broadcast that transaction is only seconds. In many cases, like in PoS situations or providing reversible services (services/products that may be cancelled by the merchant within a reasonable time frame), do not need to wait for a transaction to be 'confirmed' in a block.
Ie. I can buy my groceries at a store with bitcoin and instantly take them home, so long as the merchant has seen the transaction broadcast on the network (seconds).
For (very) high amounts or irreversible services/products (like selling software which can be copied / not returned) it's often wise to wait for a confirmation if no trust relation between merchant and customer has been established.
For high frequency trading-like applications, where thousands of transactions may occur in but a few seconds; these shouldn't even happen on the blockchain. HFT would bloat the blockchain and is not inherently compatible by design; HFT needs to occur off-chain (like microtrasactions) and may eventually be settled on-chain, so it can still happen in a trust-less way.
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:00:15


That is data you can verify regardless of whether you have the blockchain at your disposal or not simply by checking if the transaction provided is valid. Transactions cannot be forged, an API can only lie about the existence of a transaction if they've forged it, so the solution would simply be to verify the transaction.
The only way they can lie about data is by leaving it out.
You *can* verify the validity of a block without seeing the blockchain safely, you *can* verify the validity of a transaction without seeing the blockchain safely. You *cannot* verify the non-existence of a transaction spending a previous output *realistically* because it's buried in a future block. //Edit: by this I mean they can lie about a transaction output being unspent, simply by claiming a transaction that spends it does not exist.

Darkcoin (and some others) use 11 different mining algorithms, different difficulties for each, in order to combat (well, delay) ASIC development. It's pretty nice.
As to your 99% attack, yes that would be possible unfortunately. It would only affect the market on the short term though, I suspect, until the difficulty will be adjusted and all the other miners adopt the same 'exploit', at which point equality will, again, be achieved. That's assuming the exploit is publicly known.
This is the reason changing the PoW hashing algorithm to something where shortcuts are provably impossible would be desirable.

It's private but to say it is not controlled by the government [or to say that it is not _controlling_ the government -- same difference] isn't true, since the government is assuring the Fed its monopoly on legal tender.
There can be no competition to the Fed (unlike other private institutions) because:
1) Businesses are forced to accept Fed money in exchange for the goods and services they sell. Other monies do not have this benefit.
2) The Fed exclusively is allowed to counterfeit money legally, other private institutions wishing to issue currency as the Fed does would be sentenced for illegal counterfeiting of money.

No. Legions of them have.
The usual arguments against secp256k1 are these:
- Not very widely used in anything other than bitcoin
- Curve is too simple (which I think is a good thing)
- r1 is the preferred curve because reasons
None of those arguments are very impressive.
And besides that, **even if** the secp256k1 curve turns out broken for whatever reason, there will still be SHA256 and RIPEMD on top of the public key to protect the address; which is exactly why reusing addresses is bad practice for the sole reason that introduces a single point of failure.

You can look at the 12-word phrase *as* your private key, except it's encoded into words, instead of a 256 bit number value encoded into hex.
The word list used by (proper) HD wallet implementations is standardized, and should work for all wallet implementations that follow the standard. It's standardized in BIP0039: 
The wallet implementations should use is this word list (can also be found on the page above):


You're good.


It just takes time I guess. Since wallets are dealing with actual money; bugs or faulty implementations which would cause users to lose money (however unlikely) cannot be tolerated 'in the wild'. So they must be tested properly, and developed with care. Also, it's not an easy implementations because it changes the way wallets should work quite a bit.


*IF* wallets follow the BIP0032 and 39 standard (which actually is an *if* at the moment), your phrase should work in all of them. I must say though that I have read somewhere some implementations use a custom or modified word list (which is stupid) which will result in incompatibility with other implementations. This will surely be ironed out in due time if it hasn't already, but it's important to note.
Also note that even if your mnemonic phrase is constructed out of a weird word list, you'll still be able to retrieve your funds even if the wallet implementation goes down, because the code of either the wallet, or some implementation that can reconstruct the mnemonic phrase to a key will remain (open source and all that).


Seeing that Bitcoin is a fully transparant transaction system (and must be, in order to achieve decentralized consensus), you *will* be able to see the 'balance' of the address that sent you money. Note though, that HD wallets do not reuse addresses, and given some number of transactions will have a completely obfuscated history, with a large number of transactions scattered throughout the system with no apparent relation to eachother. Address reuse (other than being insecure) will ruin your privacy, HD wallets somewhat solves that.
Other options to increase your privacy are wallets that implement CoinJoin, such as DarkWallet, but this wallet is in Alpha and I wouldn't recommend using it right now. CoinJoin will mix your inputs and outputs with other users and there's no way to derive any information out of where the money in any given transaction came from. But more wide-spread implementations that do this will take some more time.

Many people here are saying this is 'the most important metric', but it's not. This is the easiest metric to manipulate.

I think many if not most people think the same. But let's look at it realistically:
- The units (100 satoshi's in a bit) are sound. Perfectly compatible with current financial systems and human semantics.
- We'll mostly see the abbreviation, XBI, and pronounce it 'EX BEE AI' in our heads. (I for one won't be telling my brain to internally deal with bits when thinking about bitcoin, it'll only confuse the poor thing)
- Calling it 'bits' sucks, plain and simple, but in day-to-day speech people will come to call it something else, which will evolve naturally. Just like 100 bits will be called something, and 10 and 50 and 1000 and so on. (dollar -&gt; buck, 1000 bucks -&gt; grand)
- *Nobody* has come up with something better, and we've been dealing with this for years.

I like how trying random passwords still got you there.
Means you use a ton of passwords for a bunch of different websites/services. And you know all of them by heart (well, even if it takes a while). And that's a good thing.
Or... or is it? Most likely it's just a random word with a very specific pattern thrown over it. Like the word 'tittietwister', with the pattern 'prepend with 2[shift]2 and capitalize last letter': final -&gt; '2 This (word + random pattern) is what at the very least 90% of all people (random statistic, still valid) apply to their password-choosing-process.
So in the end, your passwords is - once you know the pattern - as secure as a (relatively) short list of words. Note that the pattern can be derived from any of your passwords; therefore all your passwords must be assumed to be as secure as a single word.
Web wallets are crap. So long as they use passwords - that's exactly what they are. Crap.

Pretty much.
More specifically, the process of mining is hashing all of the block headers (twice, as you say), which includes the 32 byte previous block hash, a 32 byte merkle root (combined hash of all transactions contained in that block) a 4 byte timestamp, 4 byte target value ('bits'), 4 byte nonce, and 4 byte version number. Totalling 80 byte.
The target is a value derived from the 'bits' value in the header.
If the bits value is: 0x1D00FFFF (genesis block), the target value would be the result of:
    0x00FFFF * 2 (8 * (0x1D - 3))
(first byte being the base, last 3 bytes being shifted to the right).
    0x00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
If the hash of the block headers are lower than that value, it is a valid block.
(Note, this was the target value for the genesis block, the current target value is much much lower)
The header bytes for the genesis block are:
    0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003BA3EDFD7A7B12B27AC72C3E67768F617FC81BC3888A51323A9FB8AA4B1E5E4A29AB5F49FFFF001D1DAC2B7C
Which, when hashed twice, would result in:
    0x000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
Comparing that to the target value: this block is valid.

You need to make a distinction between '*the code*' and '*the protocol*' before exploring this question.
The code (rather, the code you're referring to) is the bitcoin core client, it is one of the implementations of the bitcoin protocol; it does not have to be the only implementation.
The protocol is a set of rules we use to communicate and come to consensus about the state and contents and implications of the blockchain, it can be implemented by many different clients, in different ways, by different people.
The bitcoin core client is the client maintained by the core developers you mention. They have the power to contribute proposals and code in a more direct way than you and I can. We can submit pull requests with change proposals, at which point they may or may not (consider to) implement or test them. Whether that gives them too much power over the bitcoin *code*, perhaps. Then again, it is *just* one of the implementations of the bitcoin protocol; you don't have to use this implementation, so what gives?
What's important is to realize that *everyone* has the power to implement, or use other implementations of the bitcoin protocol if they so please. If the core developers misbehave in the community's judging eye, we can get off the core client (or stick with old versions) with the snap of a finger, no problem. They have power over the code of the core client, but they have no power over the code we're running, and they have no *direct* power over the interpretation of the bitcoin protocol.

Yeah... No.
If they get hacked, we will have 'distributed' money to the hacker. Processing of transactions is completely off-chain and reliant on changetip, which means we have no control over any money being processed there until we've withdrawn.
Anyway, I'm not saying Changetip is bad, it's not. But it's important to note there's ways in bitcoin to have trustless micropayments, for free, without a middleman. In terms of implementing and rolling out platforms that enable that on as grande a scale as Changetip, we're just not there yet.
Until we are, changetip being compromised is simply a possiblity we must consider and be wary of. Anyone who's been into bitcoin for over a day can see this.

@_date: 2014-11-03 16:11:48
Changetip (as I understand it) is a centralized model for micropayments.
You deposit an amount of bitcoin to changetip, and you will be credited an equivalent amount on your changetip account. You may then proceed to tip other changetip users varying (small) amounts of bitcoin over various media, at which point changetip will adjust the balance for the two accounts involved.
At any point you may withdraw the amount credited to you on your changetip account to a bitcoin wallet.
The funds you've deposited are controlled by changetip; nothing happens on the blockchain until you withdraw, which is why I'm calling it a centralized micropayments model.
It may be used to trigger more widespread adoption because it's an extremely simple and accessible way to add value to content on internet media, allowing more people to get in touch with bitcoin and increasing overall visiblity.

The blockchain doesn't move because it is shared by all participants on the network. You shouldn't look at the blockchain as some physical object, like a trophy that is claimed by the last one to have mined a block. Not trying to sound like some daft dreamer, but the blockchain exists *nowhere and everywhere*.
What I was trying to say though: let's say someone on mars finds a block. Great, they broadcast the block back to earth. That communiqué takes a long time to even get to earth, and by the time it gets there chances are the earth chain has also found a block, thereby rejecting the mars block because earth has already moved on. Also, the current state of the blockchain on mars would be time-delayed by the time it takes for a message to reach earth in the first place; earth would likely already have found a block before the previous block would ever reach mars. 
Therefore: it's impractical to be mining the same chain when distance between miners is so great such that communication delays become an issue.

While trading directly on a blockchain may never be significant as you say, it can be done off-chain. Setting up a payments channel between involved parties can achieve trading at the scale you're implying.

Assuming that by net hash rate you mean the network hash rate.
The network hash rate is the total amount of hashes the network approximately churns out every second. Currently, this is about 269.3 PH/s for the entire bitcoin network.
The pool hash rate is the total amount of hashes a particular pool contributes to the network. For example GHash.io is currently doing about 63.26 PH/s, which is a contribution of about 23% of the total network hashrate.

Because when you're talking about preventing key pairs from being able to participate in the network, it sounds an awful lot like the payment networks banks offer their users. But when you rephrase the question to the following, it doesn't sound all that horrible: ;)


The company could create 2-of-2 multisignature transactions with one of the keys belonging to the employee, the other to the company. Every time an employee wishes to spend some of that money, they must ask the company to sign off on a transaction spending that output (optionally with a change output containing the same 2-of-2 constraints).
The result will be a situation where the company must sign all transactions the employee makes, thereby approving their purchase.

The key space is 2^256 (~ 10^77 ), this number is unimaginably large, we cannot build a machine that can even *count* (1 + 1 + 1 + etc..) to this number.
Let's take an i7 processor. Doing something like 3 gh/s per core, 4 cores, so 12 * 10^9 cycles per second, let's say 1 cycle == 1 addition.
It will take this processor roughly 8.3* 10^67 seconds to get to this number, or 2.6 * 10^59 years.
Let's say we can manage to create a machine that's 100 billion (10^11) times faster than this, and we can equip every person in the world (7 * 10^9) with this machine, and we all turn them on to *count* to this number.
It will take 10^77 / (1.2 * 10^10 * 10^11 * 7 * 10^9) = 1.1 * 10^46 seconds, 
or something like 3.4 * 10^38 years.

You can never really trust blockchain data when it is provided by anything other than the peer-to-peer network verified against your own copy of the blockchain. There's no way to prove the data you're getting is coming from the actual blockchain, or some imaginary fork.
If you want to do trustless finance, you can only do it by verifying against your own copy.
As for the other steps in your plan, and as the other comments say, check out HD addresses. Bip 32. You're looking for a public-parent key on your server, which may be used to generate public addresses, but without any private key ever touching your server / online computer.

In essence, you are correct.
But it's important to note most aspects of traditional voting systems that we need to trust can be eliminated by using a blockchain based system.
- Anyone can verify their own vote has been cast correctly
- Anyone can count all votes that have been cast
Ie. you'd no longer need to trust the machines/methods we use to vote, or trust the people/systems that are counting the votes.
The final key aspect of any voting system that cannot currently be solved by a blockchain is verifying that the set of people that are eligible to vote have been the people that cast their vote. To eliminate this, we need some proof-of-identity which has not been invented yet.

It's possible to prune the blockchain. Transactions that have been fully spent (when all outputs in a transactions have been used by other transactions as inputs) may be removed, leaving only the transaction hash (for the merkle tree). This way, the bulk of the data in the blockchain can be left out.
The unspent transaction set should be something like 200-300MB at this point (guesstimate?), which is considerably smaller than the ~25 gigs for the full blockchain.
Some nodes may want to keep a full copy of the blockchain, although this will mostly be for historical or archival purposes; fully spent transactions contribute nothing to the system except for analysis and such, it is not something your average joe needs to be doing.

If the NSA monitors my email, for which I use gmail, which is unencrypted and by either reading the email or asking Google nicely for my profile information my identity can be derived, is considered pseudonymous.
Or if the NSA monitors facebook, which I use to publicize all of my personal information to myself, facebook, the NSA and my friends, where I use my real name and identity, and where all my friends' names and activity is open to me, is considered pseudonymous.
Then I'm not sure about the definition of pseudonymous.
Pseudonymity is a concept in which an entity can be identified through something other than that entity's true identity.
I would not consider Facebook, uncencrypted email through gmail, or windows live, or any such providers, and whatever else the NSA is monitoring pseudonymous. I wouldn't even consider Reddit, in which I use a fictitious (nick)name, pseudonymous.
Furthermore, without much hassle you can obfuscate the ownership of coins which can be accessed by a certain pseudonymously identifyable entity through methods such as CoinJoin, mixing services or HD wallets. Then there's projects such as ZeroCoin or DarkCoin which provide this service inherent to the system, for example by reducing the information pseudonymously available (like the amount transacted).

A block consists of several headers and a list of all transactions that have occurred since the last block and the miner wants to admit to the block.
These are the block headers:
- Block version
- Previous block hash
- Merkle root (more later)
- Timestamp
- Difficulty target (used to determine how hard it is to mine this block)
- Nonce (used to generate different hash values out of the same block headers)
What miners do is compute a (SHA256) hash over all of those values, if the resulting 256-bit value (which is basically just a number) is smaller than the the difficulty target which is computed out of the 'Difficulty target' value in the headers, it is considered to be a valid block. Computing the hash out of all the headers is considered '1 hash', computing 100 million each second would be 100 MH/s.
The difficulty target value is a relatively small number, which makes it very unlikely for a block hash to 'by chance' be smaller than that number, but how long (how much work / computations, really) it takes is very predictable; it's easily possible to determine in advance how many hashes it takes to discover a 'valid' block just by considering the odds of any hash (of which the bits are unpredictable but about 50/50 for 1 and 0).
The merkle root is a combination of the hash of all transactions in a block. For example, in a block are 4 transactions, the merkle root of those transactions would be:
    SHA256( SHA256(tx1 + tx2) + SHA256(tx3 + tx4) )
When a new transaction is received, it will be verified and added to the end of the list and the merkle root is recalculated (not all of it, you only need to recalculate part of it because only the end of the list changed, in this case, the hash of tx1 + tx2 need not be recalculated, for example). Then the new merkle root is updated in the headers and we're all done.
Verifying if a transaction is valid takes a fraction of a second, basically you only need to execute the bitcoin script (a simple scripting language that's used, in most transactions, to verify signatures) contained inside it, and check if the output the transaction is spending is not already spent previously.
The act of verifying transactions does not really cost any computing power when you compare it to the computing power that goes into mining (ie. repeatedly computing a hash over the block headers).
All this is the proof-of-work algorithm, and what miners are doing when they mine is not so much 'verifying' transactions - because this task is trivial and barely costs any work, but more like performing work that is hard, takes time, and that anyone must do before they can reverse all the transactions that are contained in that block.
Valid blocks are contained in a chain, of which the longest chain is the only valid chain, therefore, in order for all transactions in, say, 5 blocks to be reversed, all work that must happen for 5 blocks must be repeated. This task becomes increasingly harder and is often considered impossible after but a few blocks.

It is possible. The chance of that happening is one in [a decimal number of about 70 digits, depending on the number of addresses in use]. For this reason, it is improbable, such that you can call it impossible.
The key range is 2^256 large, this is an insanely large number (and when I mean insane, I mean insane, there is not a machine we can build that can even count to this number). The chances of generating a keypair that has already been used can be pretty much ignored

Pay a higher fee.


That's up to nodes.
If miners decide not to include transactions they don't think are worth the effort of including in a block, it means they don't believe they get paid enough for this effort. We can safely assume (even if it's not entirely true) miners are in it for profits; the blockchain model that incentivizes miners makes this assumption.
Currently however, miners are taking a risk when they are including a high number of transactions because the resulting block will be slow to propagate through the network. This particular issue will be solved when headers-first is adopted by miners, which will no longer disincentive them to keep low-value transactions away from their bock.
But regardless: There is no way for us to force miners into doing anything without consensus. Nor should there be.

Most PoS merchants would be wise to classify a payment as being 'complete' after having seen it broadcast on the network. The lengths someone would have to go through to double spend a transaction you see happening before your eyes.... the chances of that happening are smaller than someone issuing a chargeback on a credit card transaction and succeeding, or running away whilst gulping a beer without paying cash.
In other words, the transaction as far as I as payee am concerned is done the second I hit 'send', which is when I get my beer.

Destroy the receipt. When the vote has been cast / published on the blockchain, there should/could be no way to trace that vote back to an identity.


Usually, a voting office requires you to identify yourself before you can use your 'voting token'. The token need not be the only requirement to casting a vote, it could be something that's unlocked by the voting office (much like BIP38), or even a 2-of-2 multisig transaction could solve this.


Not sure what a 'riding' is..? Guessing it's a district? Or in some sense any limited set of options to vote for?
There's a few ways to solve this:
1. Custom output script. In bitcoin terms: The previous transaction output defines what conditions must be met in order for bitcoin to be spent. In money terms, this means: The person giving you money, can limit the flexibility you have in spending the money. In voting terms: The voting authority can have control over the options on who or what you can vote. The ingenious design of transactions on the blockchain make this possible: bitcoin script.
2. 2-of-2 multisig transaction: The token can only be spent if 2 parties consent to casting a particular vote. In this case, the voter picks who or what to vote on, the voting authority goes along so long as the vote is cast in the correct 'ride'.
Especially option 1 is what makes blockchain and bitcoin script such a powerful technology. And as I'm writing that, I realize: a 2-of-2 multisig transaction is also nothing more than a permutation of a bitcoin script ;)

Some important things to recognize:
- Data provided *can* be verified simply by checking if the data is a valid block/transaction, and/or if it agrees with the data in the blockchain. Which, in fairness, is not something you *have to* or even can do each time you need verified data, but simply due to the fact the data can be verified, makes the data more legitimate.
- Even if the data you have is somehow forged, then, for example, signing a transaction output that is already spent (which you don't know about because the data you have is bogus) will result in an invalid transaction that will not propagate through the network; nothing happens.
- Data providers have no incentive to provide false data, if this were ever discovered their data service would not be used by anyone.
- You're right that you need to trust data providers to provide correct data, even if it is in a small way.
- Least importantly: Supplying a user with data sources they don't need or want to know about is fugly.
Personally, I would trust most data providers. Blockchain.info, blockr.io and chain.com specifically all provide simple and easy API's I would trust.

If I understand that algorithm correctly and its implication to SHA256; searching a database in N^1/2 time .. you'd first need a database of the full key and address space, which would be of length 2^256 and have a size of 256+160 bit for each record. The amount of data required is out of this world; there's as much bits of data in there as there are atoms in the observable universe. Then there's the issue of computing the actual values in that database (incrementing the privkey counter and generating the address up until the 160-bit hash, which will include a couple SHA256 computations, an ECDSA computation and a RIPEMD) which will require orders of magnitude more energy to compute than several thousand medium-to-big-ass stars will output in their entire lifetime.
Assuming you do all that, it will still take billions*billions of years to do a single lookup.

I wouldn't consider (long) confirmation times a problem that needs fixing. Confirmation times exist to allow the network some time to synchronize and agree on the state of the ledger. It is inherent to the security of the protocol.
Coins with faster confirmation times may seem like an improvement but subsequently increase the number of orphaned blocks, make it more important for miners to keep up with the rest of the network (*requiring* them to invest in an excellent internet connection) and arguably makes attacks less costly.
Note that you do not *need* confirmations to spend and output that hasn't been included in a block yet. A miner will happily take a transaction spending some output, and take another transaction spending the resulting output, and put them in the same block. It's just that most wallet software prevents you from doing this in order to protect you.

Everything can be changed with consensus.
If tomorrow for whatever reason *the entire network* (miners, nodes, users) were to agree that the maximum number of bitcoin should reach 42 million instead of 21, by implementing a new minting algorithm, it shall be so. The reason it doesn't is because the consensus in the network says this is a not good idea, and thus it shall not be so. It's a consensus network, much like democracy, so whatever the majority (varying degrees of majority) thinks is best is what's going to happen.
Changes such as increasing the amount of bitcoin in circulation will in practice never reach consensus because the consensus is that such a change would destroy the network.
Miner fees are not defined at the protocol, miners make those rules and have full discretion as to what those are (or rather, which threshold they think is worth the effort of including a transaction with a certain fee).
Block length (size) is a soft limit which, with consensus, may be changed painlessly.
Other changes that the network agrees are positive (such as P2SH transactions, which happened a few years back, and maybe some time in the future, side chains) can happen realistically with some effort.
But let's take the scenario where ECDSA is proven to be broken; public keys can be reversed to their private key, making all transactions to addresses that have already been used compromised. It'd be a very fundamental change. At this point, the network may agree that it's time to implement Schnorr signatures, which could be considered to be more secure, or some other signature algorithm rather than ECDSA, and thus, it shall be so. Currently however, there's no reason or indication that this is a good idea, no incentive, so there's no consensus, so it doesn't happen.
As for sidechains. Sidechains make it possible to implement extreme changes to the protocol that are independent of bitcoin. It allows for a great degree of innovation on top of bitcoin, enjoying the security that bitcoin provides, but without compromising bitcoin.
You can create a sidechain and basically go wild, you could create a currency that's as inflationary as the zimbabwean dollar, and not affect bitcoin the network. You could create a sidechain where every week half of all the assets contained within it are donated to some charity, and not affect bitcoin the network.

This can't happen because the bitcoin on this imaginary fork of yours is not valuable. A lot of bitcoin's value comes from its scarcity, take that away and you will be left with worthless numbers. Nobody would use a system that undermines much of the reason of its inception; certainty in scarcity.
The block reward exists to get coins into circulation in the fairest way possible in a decentralized system. The cost of each transaction with that reward included is utterly meaningless.

Some snarky comments on the introduction quiz:




False, account/address balances may be derived but are not explicitly stored.




Fully depends on the wallet's implementation and the definition of 'are going to receive'; a transaction specifying you have access to bitcoin which is valid and has propagated may be spent instantly and be included in the very same block containing the previous transaction.




The internet has nothing to do with this problem, but yeah.

Every block (and in fact all communication) would have to go to mars anyway if mars wants to participate in the network.
Mars would just be another (set of) node(s) in the network, except they are encumbered by a time-delay which renders them useless (or at least their mining contribution). If 51% of the mining power were concentrated on mars, you could say the same thing except earth would be time-delayed relative to the majority. So I wil reiterate: two time-delayed parties cannot exist on the same chain for this reason, solution: side-chain maintained locally.

This exactly. I don't in good conscience recommend a non-tech-savvy person to hold bitcoin for this exact reason, at least not without huge disclaimers.


In my opinion, trezor and entropy are the easiest and most secure. I would consider the computer of an average person to be compromised by default, so there's really no good way to have your own keys by anything other than a hardware wallet (/ key generation).
Alternatively, I'm inclined to say (updated) stock android is secure enough to generate an encrypted mnemonic, and store that on paper.
After that, centralized wallets such as those offered by Circle and Coinbase. It's centralized, so it's not really your money, but I would more eagerly recommend storing it there (with 2FA of course), than use a desktop wallet.
The best and non-easiest way is probably to use a live-cd on a disconnected old computer, generate a mnemonic, memorize it, then burn the computer just for fun and throw it down a building.

Can't tell you because I don't know what the market will do.
If you want to mitigate the risk I recommend you simply buy a small amount every day, or every week, or every month, whichever period you prefer. This is called dollar cost averaging and will reduce any losses (or profits) while buying a certain asset.
Myself, I have a recurring buy setup on Coinbase that buys an amount of bitcoin every day. I've stopped obsessing about the price as a result and I can recommend it to anyone.

We can't force miners to do anything because that would defeat consensus.
The reason many miners aren't switching to p2pool (as I understand it) is because they need to set up a full node in order to participate, whereas if they mine on a traditional pool all they need is the mining equipment and an internet connection. Requiring additional architecture is effectively deincentivizing them (plus, there are no clear benefits to mining on p2pool, even if it would benefit the network overall)

The cost to transfer bitcoin to the other side of the world is negligible, the costs you're talking about is the cost to enter and exit bitcoin as a means of transferring value.
Bitcoin will be good for remittance either when these costs are lowered, or when the requirement to entering and exiting bitcoin is eliminated (ie. when you receive bitcoin as your salary and don't have to buy your way into it, or when you can buy goods and services with it and don't have to sell it for fiat)

What I meant was there is *no way* for a distributed network of peers that do not have to trust eachother to agree on what time it is. Three quarters of the network could be lying about what time it is. (in fact, most timestamps in block headers are complete fabrications that could be off by up to an hour or 2). The only solution to agreeing on the time in a network would be to introduce an authority that just says what time it is and the network would agree, centralization.

There are 2^256 private keys.
Public keys exist in a 2^256 key space. This is not a 1-on-1 correlation and some private keys compute to the same public key, although the public keys are spread 'more-or-less evenly' over this space, if you will.
The address is a public key with some hashes over them, it is 160 bit.
There are about 2^96 public keys that can move funds for a single *address*, but it's highly unlikely that anyone has access to any of them (this may sound like a large number, but the space in which these keys exist is *magnitudes* larger).
A wallet typically has multiple private keys. In fact, a wallet should never reuse an address and create a new one for every transaction.

This is actually something many buttcoiners forget to mention when they go and bash bitcoin. It'd be a very good argument for them. Luckily, like everything in cryptocurrency, a solution is available.
The NFC spec defines something called 'card emulation', which means an NFC-enabled device, such as many modern phones, may emulate the behavior of an NFC smart card. They can do this while the device is turned off. They can get power from either the battery (which typically has plenty of juice left for simple operations, even when it's "*empty*"), or power may be transmitted wirelessly by the terminal you wish to communicate with.
Most phones contain one or multiple 'Secure Elements', these are hardware components that may be used to store data and applications in a secure way. These are components such as the SIM-card, an external SD-card, or - often - an embedded component in the NFC chip (typically the PN65N chip by NXP, if I'm not mistaken) and they may be used to store applications that can do an ECDSA signing operations. You can communicate, if you so enable it, with these applications over NFC, through card emulation.
If you can communicate with them and do signing this way, you can also do payments this way. So even when your phone is off/dead, you could still be able to pay with an NFC-enabled terminal using this method.
Now, these signing operations are, unfortunately, quite complex and they take a long time, so I'm not sure if these components (which are a super-simple and limited IC) would be able to do this efficiently.


Already there are several wallets that only require one of the two parties to be connected to the internet in order to do payments; you would retrieve a payment request (QR-code, NFC, Bluetooth, whatever), sign a transaction making that payment, transmit the signed transaction to the terminal (over Bluetooth, typically), terminal would broadcast, done.

The nonce is actually a very small range of values (4 byte - uint32) and will often be exhausted in under a second.

Being the literal nut that I am, people may lose access to those coins, yes. The coins themselves are not lost so long as the blockchain exists. As Mark Karpeles would say, they would be 'temporarily unavailable'. There's also the secondary problem that all mining hardware would be fried and no transaction could occur for years without a consented difficulty drop. Let alone the fact all hardware used to sign transactions would also be fried. Or the internet. Or power, we likely wouldn't have power as well.
Basically, back to square 1, time to build steam engines and breed horses. This would be a catastrophic event for any society regardless the currency. If it were to happen; we wouldn't give using bitcoin or some equivalent technology a thought for decades.
In any case, the energy required for an EMP to affect all technology on earth could only be from solar origin. It's highly unlikely for such an event to happen, let alone the off-chance for it being directed at earth (assuming it's a massive CME you're concerned about).

About the sidechains proposal and securing all chains through merge mining ( -&gt; 4.3 Risk of centralisation of mining
They correctly point out merge-mining for an additional/alternative chain comes at the cost of validating and keeping track of everything that happens in that chain (setting up a node for that chain). The proposed solution is to delegate this cost to an authority which will do this for you, while you only do the work/mining as you usually would.
This isn't really a satisfactory answer I'd say. Not at all, actually. Imagine a large mining pool (say, 20% of the network) subscribes to some authority which manages which side-chains are being merge-mined. This authority effectively has a massive amount of hashing power at its disposal with which it may "secure" sidechains. Now let's say a new sidechain pops up, it's got some new mind-blowing features and it's ready to be tested in the wild, except since it's new and there are no clear economical benefits yet, merge mining for this thing is really no use (yet). So nobody's doing it. It's a chick-and-egg situation.
So then this 20% authority comes round the corner and starts merge mining it for whatever benevolent reasons they can come up with, and now this new and fancy side-chain is "20% as secure as bitcoin", except that's total bullshit because all of the mining power is controlled by a single authority which is just using work of an actual bitcoin mining pool that doesn't care (nor does it have to) about anything except the main chain. So this is not secure, saying side-chains are backed by the bitcoin security model if these kind of situations remain possible is just plain wrong.
Even worse, let's say the main chain is (rough example) secured by 3 pools (30%/30%/40%), then side-chain X is secured by pool  and  X gets 30%+40% == 70% of the main chain hasing power to secure itself, except pool  clearly is in control of the majority of the work being done on this chain (57%): not secure. In other words, merged mining a chain with any amount less than the main chain makes that chain magnitudes less secure.
So I guess my question is: How can side-chains be considered secure if their security comes from merged mining?

Then again, this is indirect control, which doesn't give you absolute power. (try leading a flock of sheep off a cliff; they'll take objection to the idea).
So, so long as there's a handful of shepherds fighting over the flock(s), at least some of which make sense in the path they choose, and some sheep have half a brain to observe what's ahead, we'll be fine.

A private key is a (random) number between 0 and 2^256. It's proof that you have access to your bitcoin and should not be shared with anyone. It's a number so large it cannot be guessed even if all computers on the planet would be 'guessing' this number year-round. All you need to access your bitcoin (for most default applications, such as sending someone money) is this number.
Using asymmetric cryptography (ECDSA) and some hashing you can turn this number into a public key, which may be used to prove you own/know this number without disclosing the actual number. Doing this allows you to move bitcoin you have access to, the wallet software is doing this for you when you, for example, want to send someone money
The password (or pin, or something similar) is used to restrict access to this number by either having the application/wallet you're using keep you from spending money without providing the password, or by encrypting the private key with it (BIP38).

It's not a puzzle that can be solved in a set time. It's a puzzle for which every attempt at solving it has a very small but specific chance of being a solution. It takes the entire network around 10 minutes of work for *someone* to have come up with a solution to that puzzle with reasonable chance.


We use PoW to timestamp transactions in a distributed network. If we could reliably agree on what time it is in a distributed network of peers that don't have to trust eachother, we would not need proof of work. This cannot be enforced in a distributed network in order to accomodate a proof-of-work implementation because proof-of-work is what's facilitating our timestamps (or rather, the order of events).

If wikipedia would reuse their donation address, all the world would be able to see how much they received. In this particular instance, wikipedia likely wouldn't have a problem with that, but some donors might.
This is the type of information that would be leaked. An address publicly associated with a person or organisation is not an address suitable for those that desire privacy.
While transparency may look like a feature seemingly built-in the protocol, it is not an explicit feature. For bitcoin to be secure, the ledger must be public, as a consequence of the particular implementation bitcoin has employed (ie. addresses can be reused and the transaction amount(s) is/are clearly visible), transparancy is very easily achievable simply by associating yourself with an address.
For those that desire anonymity and privacy, there's options too, like never reusing an address and obfuscating coin ownership through CoinJoin or some mixing service. Or maybe in the future, encrypting transaction amounts is built-in the protocol (but still verifyable through some zero-knowledge proof).

And also, in the case of bitcoin: modifying your gold such that it will float back to the surface at a time you want (such as through NLockTime), or that it can be accessed by deep-sea fish that will send it back to the surface for you (multisig through intermediaries).

What's not entirely clear to me is how you would gain the right to claim the funds held in a multisig transaction, and move the funds to a 'normal' address.
You'd need N of the M signatures, but how would you broadcast it and move the coins?
And do the N signatures also represent the transaction output?

Yes. But that would happen either way if the signature algorithm were cracked in full (actually it would only be limited to addresses that have been reused, which is happening less and less, but that's beside the issue).
You can't just 'upgrade your algorithm' in the sense of upgrading a webserver in order to protect it from HeartBleed.
If the network were to support a different signature algorithm after for some reason ECDSA is proven to be broken, you would 'upgrade' by creating a transaction that is encumbered by this new algorithm instead of the old one.
Also, the network can't just protect your old, now broken, ECDSA transactions by changing to the new and better algorithm on their own behalf. You need to do this yourself.

Unless there's a fixed fee for each purchase you don't need to worry about it.
Coinbase has a 1% fee (I think?), so whether you buy 10 bucks for 30 days, or 300 bucks for 1 day, you end up paying 3 bucks in fees.
10 * 0.01 * 30 = 3

Bitcoin has no inherent relation to an anonymous network. When people say bitcoin is an anonymous currency, they mean pseudonymous. Nothing in bitcoin is anonymous.
All information shared on the blockchain is open for everyone to read from which connections between information may be derived, as such the bitcoin network cannot be considered anonymous.
Pseudonymous means the information visible to everyone is not directly connected to an identity. Like your username on reddit is not directly tied to your identity in real life, bitcoin addresses are likewise not directly connected to someone's identity.

You may also be referring to accessing the bitcoin network over Tor, which is a network for anonymous communication over the internet. It is not related to bitcoin, but may be used by people that like to preserve their online privacy and anonymity while communicating with the bitcoin network.

... right.
Let me try and debunk whatever it is you're implying is a problem.
The energy it takes for a blockchain technology to move assets (the energy it takes to record an event in the ledger) is equal to the energy it takes to achieve consensus over that ledger by those that participate within it. For the blockchain, it matters not the amount of transactions that have taken place in any given period, so long as the order of those events is agreed upon by the network.
The energy it takes while achieving consensus is that which is required by the consensus algorithm, in the case of bitcoin this is proof-of-work. The idea is that those that participate in the network are providing the energy required to achieve consensus through the addition of fees on the transactions/events that they'd like to be be recorded on the ledger.
If what you're trying to say is that the provided energy/cost (fee) is insufficient for the task the network is doing as a result of that (achieve consensus, thereby providing security). Then no, you are wrong. In this system, if you want more security, more impermeability in the ledger; provide more energy to the consensus algorithm, in other words; pay a higher fee.
Simple as that, explained in your precious laws of nature.
@_date: 2014-11-03 14:01:45
Whoever posted that was wrong.
Transactions are defined by their inputs and outputs.
Let's take 3 people in the system, A, B and C. Person A holds 50 BTC it got from mining a block. They could transfer value like this (simplified transactions with no addresses / complex stuff):
Transaction 1:
- A's 50 BTC (miner reward, coinbase)
- 10 BTC for B
- 40 BTC for C
Transaction 2:
- B's 10 BTC (received in Transaction 1)
- 2 BTC for A
- 8 BTC for C
Transaction 3:
- C's 40 BTC (received in Transaction 1)
- C's 8 BTC (received in Transaction 2)
- 48 BTC for A
Amounts can be split up and merged through transactions, but to say that every satoshi has a unique id is simply not true. Each output has a unique id though (transaction id + output index), maybe that was what that person meant.

If 30% of the mining power were to be destroyed by, say, a volcanic eruption on Iceland (where a lot of mining farms will/could be because of cheap electricity), block confirmation time would increase by approximately 30%. So about 13-14 minutes. 2-3 weeks later, difficulty will be adjusted and we'll be back at 10 minutes per block. No problem.
It's a non-issue so long as a considerable portion of the total hashing power is not wiped out. As in 80% or over.
Let's take the rather unlikely situation where 99.8% of the mining power is gone because terrorists that have (of course) been funded with bitcoin, started dropping planes on all mining farms all around the world, only miners that put their miners in bunkers are still running. It takes weeks to mine a single block now. We, the community, the users and the miners that are left-over *could* all agree something needs to be done to remedy this short-term problem. It'd be possible (though not necessary or required) for the network to achieve consensus, and drop the difficulty to an appropriate value such that the block time is, again, back at 10 minutes.
If there's network consensus, if the community wants it, anything can happen. (Although in this particular situation, I'd say it's more likely we all start building mining equipment like crazy because it'd be hugely profitable).
@_date: 2014-11-03 12:49:14
See 
I don't see storage as a problem for scalability. With transaction pruning (deleting old transactions that are no longer relevant / spent) we don't need to keep all transactions (in fact, we can scrap most) that have ever occurred, except for the occasional archival node. Besides that, storage is cheap as fuck.
Networking, in terms of scalability, I believe is far greater a problem because this is a scalability problem that explodes with adoption.
In any case, I don't see us running into any of the scalability problems any time soon and the best people are working on them.

It prevents pool operators from being able to keep the methods/rules/policy the pool uses when assembling a block private. (Rather, it allows pools to publish these rules and letting miners apply these rules themselves)
This way, independent miners can join a pool fully knowing what they're contributing hashing power to, while still getting the benefits of mining in a pool (a more constant rate of profits)

Not until an ISP fully validates and blocks all communication passing through its systems.
If, say, all communication to port 8333 is blocked, you'd simply switch to 8334 or whatever else is open and you're done. (if worse comes to worse you can use 80 or 21 or 25 or 443 or another that's less likely to be blocked)
If they block specific domains / websites (for web wallets); use another DNS (ie. 8.8.8.8), if they block specific IP's; use proxy or VPN.
If they block specific communication (DPI), use VPN. If they end up inspecting or blocking VPN communication somehow, scramble the payload using one of many VPN implementations.
If they somehow learn how to block all of that (effectively destroying the internet), use IPoAC ( or mesh networks, or wires, or text messages, or radio communication, or shouting really loud.

But in all seriousness, while I get what you're saying and I agree, by accepting Bitcoin as a vendor, you most likely save on transaction fees you'd usually pay for with transactions involving 'the currency of the old days'.

Many people think Bitcoin will be banned by major governments, killing the value, or naturally die off due to the payment network not functioning as intended and being based off a bubble. Whether you want to believe that's true is up to you. Personally I think it's a load of crap.
For me, the greatest risk is in a competing - blockchain based - payment network outtrumping the bitcoin payment network. But I don't believe competition is something to be afraid of in this space, and we'll be able to see it coming long before it's happened. Plus, even though I consider it the greatest risk, I'd say it's unlikely at this point.

People you don't know may steal and use your credit card information to make transactions and, 'buy things on any internet site' without you knowing, for which, of course, you are protected by your precious Consumer Credit Act, but for which you do not have the proper tools, or any tools, really, to prevent from happening in the first place...
Any merchant you pay with your credit card, is paying for your convenience to use that credit card, which of course is reflected in the price of the product you are buying...
Any merchant you pay with your credit card is hardly protected by any act, leaving them at risk of chargebacks and paying for a product they sold with their own money, resulting in them potentially recording your personal information, thereby affecting your privacy in order to protect themselves.

@_date: 2014-09-23 14:42:53
I must say I agree with most of your sentiment. But let me entertain your imagination.


What if you could have control over your money, spending, privacy and security, while still enjoying all the benefits your credit card offers? Including consumer (and merchant) protection - perhaps not by an Act put into a regulatory law, but because the payment system makes it profitable and desirable for all parties involved, and unprofitable/pointless for any conners/scammers.
This, true enough, is not anything bitcoin or any service/platform on top of it offers *right now*, but this is what it's heading toward, it is what several companies are trying to get done right now, and bitcoin certainly has the potential to go there.
Bitcoin is young, but still, all it has accomplished in the short years since it was invented have been astounding. Going from a valueless asset to a valued asset in a mere 2.5 years, and going from useless to useful in another 2; consider bitcoin, with all the innovation happening on top of it, another 2 years from now. Consumer and merchant protection inherent to payment protocols, smart contracts, provability, all the goodness.

Less overhead, no worries, no potential for fraud, no potential legal issues. These are valid reasons for not accepting CC.

Personally I really like the 'days destroyed' metric (# days idle * amount transacted), except it's not easy to get any good conclusions out of it. I do believe it's one of the 'pure' metrics that's very hard to manipulate.
For example, given you know average consumer spending habits in the bitcoin ecosystem (hard to do accurately), you could derive which transactions are likely to be genuine consumer transactions (rather than bogus a-to-a transactions, exchange deposits/withdrawals, gambling, etc.), thereby deducing adoption rate.
@_date: 2014-12-15 12:03:05
Let's say in 30 years we're doing about 500 million transactions per day on average, or ~6000 / second. The block reward will be negligible and most of the mining incentive will come out of transaction fees.
Taking into account consumer behaviour, we _could_ see something like ~15k/sec peaks and ~3k/sec troughs over the course of a week.
This would therefore affect the incentive to mine at a given time. Would it be fair to assume (many) miners will turn off their equipment during the troughs - because it is not profitable to mine at these times, and turn it back on toward the peaks; making confirmation times longer on the off-hours/days and decrease confirmation times toward the peaks? Do you think this would be a problem?

Like any other communications platform. So basically, it doesn't.
Let's say we started using bitcoin all over the planet today, and in 15 years time we will create a mars colony, they would also use bitcoin. They're pretty much fucked.
The 'mars-nodes' would broadcast their time to our 'earth-nodes', but that broadcast would probably take about 5-20 minutes or so to get here? Depending on where mars is relative to earth. That's probably fine for transaction broadcasts and syncing with the network, because they allow for a large margin. It'd be slower, confirmations would take a lot longer for all mars-transactions, and the network adjusted time would be a bit skewed, but it'd work, crappily.
Mars-miners would have a hard time keeping up with the network though.. Seeing that it takes ~10 mins for new blocks to get to them, and another ~10 to reach the majority of the network if they were to find a valid block... The network would outpace them by a large margin and mars-miners would effectively be pointless.
The solution is to create a local mars-economy; mars-chain, limited to mars only. They could interact with the earth-chain via side-chains. So it's possible, just not on the bitcoin (earth) blockchain.

In the past few months the hashrate has doubled - a couple of times. The cost of mining has increased significantly. With little bitcoin buying demand to combat this cost increase, I'd say the recent price drops are a natural outcome.
With the price of bitcoin far outweighing the price of mining, there's no reason for miners to sell off the left-over bitcoin they earn after breaking even with the (dollar)cost of mining. However now that the cost of mining has increased so significantly, an increased demand to sell bitcoin in order for miners to break even would be a logical prediction.

I'm no math expert either, but having looked at elliptic curves and trying to understand it ... the basic problem its security depends upon is so simple (much like the integer factorization problem in RSA) .. it's hard to conceive of a way that can possibly be 'cracked'. The amount of information thrown away to even calculate the public key from the private key - I don't see how that could be reversed anytime soon. But I'll gladly be surprised.
Note that in some way elliptic curve math is already 'cracked', by design (same with RSA). It's just computationally infeasible to do it (as in, it would take an unreasonable amount of time to the point it could be considered impossible).
As for alternatives, yes, there's plenty. Gavin himself suggested he would have preferred Schnorr Signatures ( over ECDSA had he been given the choice in a recent AMA.

When you consider the amount of (polluting) resources it takes to run banks, fiat money transport, ATM maintenance and all the other things to keep the (dare I say obsolete) traditional financial infrastructure running, then the resources it takes to run miners doesn't seem all that great, even if bitcoin were adopted globally.
Additionally, it's possible with greater ease to have mining operations go green fully, not only because miners often run in datacenters which may take advantage of green power supply, but also because green electricity is economical, which incentivizes miners.

Yes, this is what I'm thinking aswell. What I worry about is whether this would be fair to those that have no choice about when they transact.
Furthermore, I wonder whether or not this would drive apart the peaks and troughs even further; it would be a circularly incrementing effect if varied fees depending only on date/time of transactions were to be implemented by *(all)* miners.
I'm hopeful the market effect would even this out, though.

This is deflation of money. The effect of money that can no longer take part in circulation around the system is that all the left-over money is worth a little bit more.
It's what people mean when they say bitcoin is a deflationary currency; money can be lost, but it cannot be reintroduced by producing more.
You can compare it to throwing bars of gold into the middle ocean where it can never be found again.
It's not a big issue for bitcoin because they are, essentially, infinitely divisible. (currently down to 8 decimal places, but if we ever need more, we can simply increase the divisibility without changing the value)

Yes, it is (for a standard pay-to-pubkey-tx, see  stored in the *scriptsig* of a transaction (input) that spends a previous output.
Every transaction defines what conditions must be met in order for an amount of bitcoin to be *spent* by another transaction in its transaction outputs.
For a standard Pay-to-pubkey-tx, the outputs are basically saying this:


The pubkey that could actually spend that output is not revealed at this point (only the address is), and is only revealed when another transaction comes along that is spending that output. Only then is the public key stored in the blockchain: in the transaction that spends the previous one.
Hope that clears it up somewhat.

Yes and no.
Yes: Decreasing the difficulty such that it takes 5 seconds to generate a block is trivially easy.
No: It takes time to propagate blocks and transactions through the network. With a 5-second block target, the tip of the chain would fork constantly, reorganisations would be the norm and you would still have to wait an extended period of time before you can be reasonably certain a transaction is permanent; it would change nothing.

The coin part is to refer to bitcoin as being a 'cash' equivalent; you can hand another person money without another party having control over the transaction, like cash.

The bit part refers to computers/digital, which is of course the space bitcoin lives.

If it's a (4 digit) pincode, just keep trying what you could have inputted. If you can count the number of possibilities in a timely fashion, you can crack it. Or you could ask mycelium support if there's a straightforward way of recovering your pincode. I'm assuming this isn't the first time this happened to someone.
Actually, went through the trouble of googling for you: 
If you're thinking about rooting your phone in order to fetch the pincode, remember **NOT TO** wipe it. So, I hope your phone is already rooted and it'll be simple.

As a sidenote, changing the mining/hashing algorithm to something completely different would likely require different mining hardware; ASIC's will not work (as well) for, say, SHA-3 as they do SHA-256.

Bitcoin need not (note: but can! MtGox and all) give a company any control over your money, contrary to traditional banks. This is an inherent property of the bitcoin protocol and the payment network. This property is what makes bitcoin different from existing currencies and assets.
This property has the potential to change a company's slogan from "won't be evil" to "can't be evil". This property could reduce a bank's function to a payment service provider rather than the enormous monetary institutions that have become too big to fail, bail and jail.

The unintentional one was because of an implementation bug that allowed for the illegitimate creation of billions of bitcoins by overflowing the (integer) output amounts of a transaction such that the result is a negative number. The core developers swiftly patched the problem and miners updated their client soon after that, it lasted for only 16 blocks or so before the 'good fork' overtook the 'bad fork'.

I'm guessing you're referring to this code:
    var hash = new Buffer(TXIN.split('').reverse(), 'hex');
I suppose it's got to do with big endian &lt;&gt; little endian conversion. Everything in bitcoin is little endian (least significant bits first), while most programming languages are big endian (most significant bits first), so in the above code they reverse the characters in a char array (the .split('') turns it into a char array) and have thereby changed from little endian to big endian.
// Edit: Or, after looking at the code around it, it looks like they're encoding a transaction prior to broadcast, so it's probably the other way around and they're converting to little endian.

Interest is a non-sensual concept for money that's just sitting there, so you are correct.


That's exactly what I'd be paying it for.


I am, except for the fact that I have no desire to be responsible for its security under my bed, which is what I'm paying another party, the bank, for. This responsiblity was in fact the core business model banks originally started off with, it's since changed to something different.
Unfortunately, with most inflationary fiat money this concept doesn't work due to the fact you practically require your money to gain interest in order not to be throwing it away. Which is the entire reason banks like the one I describe do not exist (anymore).

Very well said. And I agree.
But let's take the martian example. If a martian were to come here and see us all sleep, while being unfamiliar with the concept. How would we go about explaining sleep to such a creature? Sleep is a concept that comes natural to us because we experience it every single day. We need not explain it because we cannot, because we never have, because we do not have the words for it to be put simply.
Then apply this to bitcoin. How can we explain hashing algorithms, signature algorithms, ownership, determinism or proofs in the context of bitcoin, to a person that has never grasped the concept of such a thing? It cannot be done without losing most of the information we're trying to pass on. An answer to the question "What is bitcoin?", it cannot be put into a sentence without some prior knowledge about what bitcoin is built upon.
When we try to explain bitcoin, we use overly abstract analogies that are not at all accurate when looked at strictly. Like a key to a vault (signatures / asymmetric cryptography), or a lock with no key (hashes), or performing computations that will eventually 'find' a block, and so on. The information contained in those analogies have lost all of their value.
The information is there, but it cannot be put into words simply while retaining its value.
The process of learning something comes from spending time and effort into trying to learn it. However complex the thing you're trying to know more about is; it is not the words that explain it simply, but the energy and effort you spend learning it what teaches you how it works.

They 'solved' the double spending problem by making the inner workings of the chip a black box. Nobody except the bank knows exactly how it works and therefore it's infeasible to double spend with ChipKnip - along with the fact when the system syncs with the banks' network, your double spend is exposed, and since it's tied to your identity, you're busted. That, along with the fact you can only buy mars bars with it, nobody is/was really interested in researching how the chip works exactly (ie. exposing some key used to salt a transaction hash, or similar).
This system is not a solution to the double spend problem. It works so lang as the way it works remains unknown, and all participants remain honest.
Then there's all the other problems riddling its adoption; it's not an open platform, there's no way to check the balance except by using a terminal, constantly having to charge, can't protect it with PIN (sort of BIP38), still need a bank card, still need a bank. All these problems are inherent to the fact it's a system issued by banks of which the workings are meant to be secret.
Also, the currency used by the system is premined.

And in many ways it already is.
Quantum computing allows one to compute the private key out of the public key in an amount of time which is practical. ECDSA would need to be swapped out to prevent edge case attacks for this reason, although all existing pubkey outputs will be stolen.
Hashing is much less vulnerable to attack.
Most (unspent) outputs' pubkeys (of the pay-to-pubkey-hash variety, not P2SH) are secured by SHA256 + RIPEMD. Quantum computing effectively lowers the search space for this algorithm from 2^256 to 2^128, and 2^160 to 2^80 through Grover's algo, which is still plenty secure.
I find it extremely unlikely for Grover's (quantum search) algorithm to be applicable to find collisions for mining valid blocks, or retrieving a colliding (valid) script out of a P2SH/RIPE-MD hash.

I respectfully disagree for 2 reasons. Though I only disagree from my own perspective and situation (take that as you wish).
Considering only facts:
In 2010 we implemented a block size limit of 1 MB. Therefore, we were fine *then* and had consensus over the fact that blocks could potentially become 1 MB in size, and the resources we would be using if that were to happen. Great.
It's 2015 now.
The Bitcoin Core software has been greatly improved. As Gregory Maxwell pointed out earlier:


That's huge.
In addition to that, equivalent hardware and bandwidth has become cheaper. 5 years ago I could buy an Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 for EUR. ~180, a clock I could easily run Core/qt 0.1 with, today I can buy a clock 4 or so times more powerful for the same price. I was rocking a staggering 8mbit internet connection back then, today it's 200mbit for the same price. General consumer storage pricing has roughly halved in the last 5 years, even more so for SSD storage.
Further (non-fact), we've got pruning in the pipeline, which makes storage trivial. And libsecp256k, which is another 4-5 fold increase in signature checking performance. Then there's IBLT which could potentially halve bandwidth use, and rate limiting which makes bandwidth use somewhat configurable.
*If* we were fine with 1 MB blocks 5 years ago solely for resource expenditure, then surely we can be fine with 20 MB blocks today. It's only become cheaper.
I disagree running a node and contributing back to the network is volunteering.
Running a node gives you certainty you otherwise do not have. It allows you to truly 'be your own bank'. It allows you to really trust no one. You owe nothing to anyone, you do it for no one. You are part of consensus.
I am more than willing to expend the resources required for this. It's worth the cost.

The structure of block headers haven't changed since Satoshi first came up with it. I suspect, though, he didn't initially think the 4 byte nonce header would be exhausted as fast as it is now. The total network hash rate has been doubling every few months for years now, which is expansion beyond the imaginable back when he first created the protocol.
But yeah, it's amazing how spot-on he's been at building the initial protocol; which algorithms to use, all the little specifics in the protocol, the scope with which Bitcoin Script (scripting language used in transactions) may be applied. It's tremendous.

Send him the username and an imaginary password.
If he is idiotic enough to log in and not anonymize his location in any way, you'll get an email telling you his IP address and an approximate location.
Then send him an email and ask how much stamps/fee you need to put on a postcard in order to reach [approximated country].

Pretty unlikely.
At best, they know of a backdoor in the ECDSA secp256k1 curve, which is still rather unlikely, because they had nothing to do with creating this specific curve; no opportunity to add a backdoor.
ECDSA is a digital signature algorithm set, it's the concept where you can sign something, using something, thereby proving you have knowledge of the latter 'something', without exposing that 'something' (the private key). If they have a backdoor they can either derive the private key from the public key, or from a signature, or from multiple signatures. The secp256k1 curve is an odd one in the bunch (because it's a very simple curve), but, unlike many others, the NSA did not create it.
In most bitcoin transactions the public key is not exposed (they are hashed using SHA256 and RIPE-MD) until the coins that are protected by its corresponding private key are being spent. For some (older type of) transactions, the public key *is* exposed, so if the NSA (or anyone) has a backdoor, they could potentially steal all of those coins. If they can derive a private key quickly (in seconds), then potentially they could also attempt to double spend any 'modern' transaction spenditure, which would be bad. But in any case, if it happens, then everyone will know, the NSA will have exposed their biggest exploit ever to hit the public, be hugely discredited, we will switch out the algorithm for another and be mostly fine (as far as the network itself goes). So far, the NSA or some other bearcat can only steal coins.
As for inflating the currency: No. This would imply they can either trick us into creating more coins than blocks allow, which is easily checked for and network consensus rules forbid, or they can somehow create valid blocks using a flaw in SHA256, which will be corrected fairly quickly after the next difficulty change. Whatever the case, there can never be more than the hard limit of 21 million coins because it simply is not allowed by the network consensus rules.
As for destroying, yes, they can destroy coins just like you and I can - if they are the owner of those coins. By making them unspendable through OP_RETURN, or sending them to an address of which no one is the owner. But they first would need to have access to those coins, which are protected by all of the cryptography outlined above. And again, everyone would know.

That doesn't look very **useful**. It can be completely decentralized, though.
For the record: I'm in favor of increasing the block size limit in some smart way we can agree upon, but it's important to get the facts straight. The argument where the network may centralize further because the increasing cost to fully validate and participate has merit.
Also note that this isn't a binary outcome; increasing the block size limit to, say, 20MB will not completely centralize the network, doing nothing will not completely (keep it) decentralized either.
The reason I'm in favor of increasing the block size is because I think this potentially increasing cost is acceptable to bear; while realizing it may not be for other participants.
@_date: 2015-05-06 13:08:37
That's true, I don't see a way for a block size limit to auto-correct into a reasonable value.
But to correct it through community consensus and a hard fork every time we run into it for legitimate reasons is worse than heuristically estimating something we can reasonably live with, I reckon.

You can find someone who's forked bitcoin once, or someone who's worked with transacting over the network as a hobby with an ad. If you're looking for gavin-like properties (or anyone in the core dev team and many other experienced developers in the ecosystem, really) an ad won't do. You'll need to either find *them* and convince them your project is worthwhile, or train them. They won't find you when you push out an ad through the usual channels because they're not on those channels.
Visiting conferences, reaching out to people in the ecosystem, building a network in the cryptocommunity, would, I believe, be the best option to finding 'a gavin'.

Again, everyone has this power, and everyone has the power to prevent these changes. But there is no real 'veto' (as in a presidential veto, where a single party just says 'no', doesn't exist in bitcoin because it's a consensus model).
Let's take the side-chains proposal for an example (  ): This proposal is under development by an organisation called BlockStream. Let's assume they have a working implementation in mid 2015 and would like to have the entire network use it; ie. propose to merge it into Bitcoin Core and allow all other implementations or branches to implement it in a given period.
The network may at this point be in disagreement on whether or not they want this change, let's say the network is divided 50/50 and they cannot reach a compromise. In practice we'll go to great lengths to reach consensus, be it by a compromise or by simply convincing the other side the proposal is good (or not). But let's just assume that's not gonna happen and half the network decides the adopt side chains while the other half doesn't.
The network would then fork, we'd have 2 versions of the protocol running alongside eachother. Both 'sides' would have their way but due to the change they would no longer be compatible with eachother. The effects that would have on the value of the network are hard to predict but I guess it's safe to assume it would be a turbulent time to say the least. Either way, everyone would - strictly seen - have their way (even if it would be catastrophic for the network as a whole, which is why it's safe to assume this will not happen lightly)
Let's take the same example, except this time the entire network *except me* is in consensus. The network decides to adopt side chains, and I refuse to. The network would then also fork, with a version of the network ran by me personally (because for some reason, I still see utility in bitcoin without the network effect), and the rest of the network would be running a version of the network with side chains. In this case, everyone would still have their way, even though the fact I'm running my own fork of the network may not be particularly a smart decision seeing that my fork wouldn't have much value; I'll still have been able to enforce my own decision in the matter.
As for this last part, if I ever, after forking, decide to rejoin the network (adopt the side chain change); everything I've done since the fork will not have happened in the 'side chains network', but I will still have access to everything that happened before the fork. So it wouldn't be all that catastrophic for any party.
// Edit: In addition to the last paragraph: I may choose to broadcast everything I'm doing on my own 'forked network' to the 'sidechains network' aswell, and assuming transactions are backward compatible in the sidechains network (safe to assume), those transactions will occur on both; me switching to the 'sidechains network' would in this case be painless. This would also apply to the 50/50 scenario; users of both networks that just don't care, they just go along with the flock, would most likely not be affected. (this happened in a previous fork)

Personally I think it's an exceptionally bad idea to push multiple hard-fork changes at the same time. It makes the issue of changing network consensus rules magnitudes more complicated, and massively more politically complex.
Other (non-hard-fork) changes that could be pushed alongside the block size change, include things such as libsecp256k, which by that time should/could be sufficiently tested and ready to be used by the network. Fixing malleability as outlined in BIP62 and BIP66, along with the malleability fix proposed in the lightning network could potentially also be done around that time (but preferably earlier).

The bearwhale (bear being a pessimistic trader, whale being a trader with heaps of money they're trading with) is speculated to have driven down the price to 300 for weeks by selling bitcoin by the barrels, where he/she/they/it ended up placing a massive 'sell wall' of 30.000 BTC (that sell wall being a sell order saying to sell 30k btc for $300 each).
For this 'wall' to break down, the market needs to buy it, meaning $9mil needs to be spent buying $300 bitcoin. In the end, another whale appears to have bought the whole lot in 1 go.
Why this bearwhale popped up and drove the price down, and if his plan succeeded (seeing that his massive sell-wall was bought)? We can only guess:
- Increase the cost of mining in order for other miners to turn off their machines (meaning: bearwhale has mining operation going on)
- Bearwhale has interest in a low bitcoin market value (ie. to buy a massive amount of bitcoin off-market for cheap)
- Early adopter decided to cash out

Those are other issues which thankfully go largely undisputed because their advantage is clear to everyone, and if not, easier to make clear because they are mostly technical in nature and it's easier to produce proof they are better than alternatives.
I'm saying there's no consensus *on this issue*.
This issue is political for the most part, there is no best solution, everyone has an opinion, each opinion is, or could be, valid, and everything contradicts everything. It's hard to produce proof that anything is better than anything else without basing them on assumptions that may very well be false. It's hard. And there is no consensus.

Anything that's off-chain is not protected by bitcoin's security. For bitcoin to be a secure alternative to the current financial system, the 'killer apps' need to be on-chain.
The blockchain does allow for situations where it's "a little bit of both", such as micropayments channels. You will essentially deposit a number of bitcoin into limbo, controlled by you and another party. In order to move the coins out of limbo you need both parties to agree on a transaction. This is essentially an off-chain situation in which both parties may exchange (very) frequent messages with eachother, negotiating a single transaction that may be settled on the blockchain by either party at any time.
For example, paying for gas using a micropayments channel will allow you to negotiate a transaction declaring you pay the gas station a given amount for every milliliter you've put in your car, which will be negotiation *while you're gassing up your car*, without touching the blockchain. When you've gassed up your car, either party (you or the gas station) broadcasts the final transaction to the blockchain and you're done.
If you decide to make a break for it halfway without paying for gas, the gas station will still be able to get paid for gas up until the point you decided to bug off, mitigating possibility of fraud substantially.

Well, there is no 'wrong' fork. There is only 'your' fork. Whatever rules you agree with is your fork.
But let's say you want to transact with someone on a fork which isn't 'yours'. *If* the transaction *output* you're spending is on the same fork as the other guy (which happens if the transaction output you're spending hasn't occurred on both forks, as in, the transaction is old, or normal enough it's valid and has been included on both chains, which will be most of the time) you will *probably* be fine.
I'm saying probably because this is tricky business.
If a (transaction-backward-compatible) fork occurs, your coins will exist on both, and any spending of those coins will be valid on both - assuming they are broadcast on both.
That's not to say a fork of the network isn't a bad thing; it is. Fragmentation of the community and the way we interpret the rules is dangerous for bitcoin as a whole, which is why we should always strive for consensus in the way we do things before trying to change anything. But ultimately, ordinary users will likely be unaffected either way (apart from fluctuations in price value as a result of failed agreement)

You need an on-chain transaction to get yourself started on the lightning network. And you need an on-chain transaction to fall back to in case of failure of anything that happens on the lightning network.
Then there's the myriad of ways the blockchain can be used for things other than transacting, like proof of publication, notaries, legacy transactions, etc.
It doesn't make the blockchain obsolete, not by a long shot, it just bypasses some of its sluggishness.

Any hyper-inflation event to date was caused by a central institution creating money out of thin air uncontrollably in order to pay off debt. After having paid off that debt with a severely inflated currency, prices rise, consumption stops, debt returns, resulting in an exponentially worsening inflationary spiral.
Without a central institution with the power to create money, the hyper-inflationary outcome to an economy that does not function is eliminated. Still, it's very possible an economy based upon a decentralized monetary model does not function, the eventual outcome to such a situation is mostly unknown on a grande scale but I would reckon it would more concretely address the components of the economy that are not functioning properly, rather than paying them off with made-up money.
Whether or not a hyper-inflation event will happen to the US(D) (or, say, the EURO), I wouldn't know.. a lot of powerful people would want to keep up the charade that the system is working fine as it is, so it depends on how long they can keep it up. All I know is I won't be having any of their inflatable currency by that time.

2.1 * 10^10 transactions per day = 665 tx/s on average
Assuming we need to be able to support 10 times that (peak times and such), so let's round off to ceil(665 * 10) = 10 000 transactions per second. This is about 2-3 times as much as the Visa network. And it's about 1000 times more than the bitcoin network is currently doing (we're doing roughly a transaction per second).
Currently, blocks larger than 10 MB are not accepted by the network (for various reasons, this limit can be eliminated with little effort - assuming consensus).
So, let's see what a node has to be dealing with in order to support 10k transactions per second:
**Internet connection:**
10^4 (peak) * 500 byte (assumed avg. transaction size) = 40+ mbit up and down, let's say 50 mbit
Assuming full storage and no pruning:
10 ^3 (average) * 500 byte (avg. tx) * 3600 * 24 * 365 = ~ 16 TB per year
With pruning:
I don't know, you basically only need the utxo set (which is typically stored in RAM), and a trivial number of blocks, which at 10k tx/s could be anywhere between 50GB and 1TB or so? I have no idea. This would probably have to move out of RAM...
Roughly 10k signature verifications (takes time) and hashes (hardly takes time) per second, current hardware can do this already.
Already there's hardware that can scale to 3 transactions per person per day for every person on earth. Plus there's a bunch of optimizations in the pipeline that can smooth the rate at which we can scale to this point (Gavin and others are working on this tirelessly).
We'll get there, at least for the foreseaable future.

The 'long' and lagging 2 week difficulty readjustments offers an important security benefit by allowing one to better assert whether they've been shielded from the actual bitcoin network or not.
If, say, a 95% drop in hashrate due to some catastrophe were to ever occur and affect the bitcoin network severely (20x higher confirmation times) we can solve that by either forking or waiting it out. Hashrate drops lower than 50% (where 50% of the hashrate disappears) or so for legitimate reasons are entirely manageable given an otherwise healthy network, and a sufficiently large block size limit.
Whatever the case, removing the 2 week difficulty security benefit to prevent a rather unlikely doomsday scenario is not a smart move if you ask me.

A transaction typically takes but a few seconds to propagate *through* at least most of the network. This means within a few seconds you'll be able to confirm *a* transaction has been broadcast declaring bitcoin is being transferred to your address.
The act of 'processing' a transaction takes nanoseconds, negligible, but since it's not done centrally, but by a distributed network of peers/nodes, it's being processed thousands of times, which takes - including propagation - the few seconds mentioned. It's fast.
It takes, on average, about 5-15 minutes for a transaction to confirm *on* the network (depending on the fee, and some other factors, but for your typical transaction this would be the case). When the transaction has been confirmed at least once by having it included in a block, it's safe(r) to assume the transaction is permanent, and you have sole access to the bitcoin sent to you.
So: You should **never** 'take someone's word' for the occurrence of a transaction. The act of doing this implies offering a ridiculous form of trust to some party other than yourself, which is an issue bitcoin is trying to solve/mitigate. If your situation allows for 0-confirmation transactions (transactions that have been broadcast to the network and *you* have seen/'processed', but not yet confirmed in a block), such as PoS purchases, service purchases or any reversible service/product you offer; you can somewhat safely allow for them in your business. All other types of purchases; wait for the transaction to confirm, which is about 5-15 minutes (or whatever block depth you want it to confirm to).

It is if the only number you look at is the amount of nodes that exist in the network. But that number isn't what makes a system more or less centralized.
If 5000 out of 6000 nodes are operated by a single entity, the network wouldn't be very decentralized.
A decentralized system is a system where many independent and possibly vastly different people participate in it. To get such a system to decentralize further, it's better for the barrier to participate to be low.

Yeah, that's what I've been hinging toward despite the way I feel about JavaScript as a language.
It's an excellent language for the web; capability limited (which is a huge plus in a web application), does everything a language should be able to do and it performs reasonably well (in modern browsers). It's just the horrid syntax, lack of type safety, the fact there is only 'Number' - a 64 bit double, the ease at which you can produce spaghetti code or otherwise unmaintainable projects. Ugh.
That's why I like GWT. You develop in Java, object serialization, moving things over the wire is a breeze, seamless support for GWT-RPC, jsonp, etc., you got your (compile-time) type safety, proper IDE's, a myriad of existing Java projects, you add it to your build street, got your unit tests, code style and quality assurance checks, existing and robust dependency management, the works.
Then you compile it to JavaScript and you got a web application.

Individuals choose to validate using a certain ruleset and abide by it. It's as simple as that.


Miners choose a timestamp and perform work on it. If a node sees it (while fully synced) and it is too far off their own clock, they will discard it (and warn the user). Nodes generally accept blocks with timestamps that are up to 2 hours off from their own clock in either direction.
The timestamp is the only value in the blockchain that nodes _cannot_ retroactively (that is, while validating the past) validate to be a fabrication.

There is no 'data' field in a bitcoin transaction. Not explicitly.
You can insert up to 40 bytes of data using an OP_RETURN output, but do note whatever coin amount you put in that output will be forever destroyed (it can never be spent). And yes, this will be embedded in the blockchain forever.
Pruning is the concept of discarding old and fully spent transactions which are no longer relevant to the network and are only useful for analysis and historic purposes. Pruning allows you to run a fully verifying bitcoin node using no more than 1GB of harddisk space. (as opposed to an ever increasing ~40Gigs)

Casting a vote should - in my opinion - only be allowed to happen in a controlled environment where the voter is protected from intimidation. No matter how clever the technology, you cannot prevent intimidator x from forcing you to vote on candidate y when you can vote from your home computer.
The way you cast your vote inside this controlled environment, however, would be an excellent application for a blockchain based technology.
The way I could see this happening:
- Voter receives voting token in the way you describe. (exchange proof of identity for a token through election authority)
- Voter goes to a voting office/location
- Voting office is safe from intimidation the same way it is in any voting environment today. Only on these locations is voting allowed
- Voter casts vote (anonymously), vote is recorded on the blockchain
- Voter receives vote confirmation (receipt), which may be destroyed, published or kept.

Regardless. Reusing addresses decreases the layers of security on top of your private key from 3 to 1.
@_date: 2014-11-17 14:15:59
The private key must never be revealed, as is implied by the word 'private'. It is a key that is supposed to be known only to the owner of the address. blockchain.info couldn't display that key if they wanted to, it would break the system if they could.
You'll see the address and the 160-bit (RIPEMD) hash that it's representing, and nothing more. If the transaction has already been spent, you can see the public key in the transaction that spends it.

Sure, but that's not the main problem Bitcoin solves, which is the independence of central authorities over the exchange of money.
(although negligible transaction fees are a natural result of the fact this problem has been solved)
By storing your bitcoin at a centralized institution such as Coinbase or Circle you have relinquished control over your money to them, putting yourself in the same situation you're in when you're 'holding' fiat. It's fine in select situations (such as when you do not *want* to have responsibility over storing and securing your money), but bitcoin was not invented to be just a digital version of traditional money.

Then that would cause coins to be introduced to the system at a pace much faster than expected in the beginning (no rational miner would pass up on that sweet, sweet subsidy) and much slower later on. That's a huge adverse side effect; removing certainty over the 10 minute confirmation time.
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:57:13
It isn't really a solution IMHO. A band-aid at best.
Miners and (not even that) wealthy attackers could still systematically fill up blocks in order to artificially increase the average. This measure will only introduce friction and lag to a potential problem without mitigating the actual problem.
That said, I'm pro increasing the block size deterministically at some agreed-upon rate (which also doesn't solve said problem), although I'm fast-realizing we may not come to agree on the actual rate, if at all.
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:57:10
1. The network is the oversight. Everyone and everything participating in the bitcoin network has power over the set of rules we follow. It's a consensus model. There is not a single person or organisation that has control over changes to bitcoin or the bitcoin protocol because it is a system operated by a network of people that agree on the rules and the workings of said system. If Gavin or anyone on the core dev team, or anyone else wanting to add/modify features/properties of the bitcoin protocol, it will require consensus of the network. No consensus, no change.
2. I don't know much about how the/a ETF works, or why it would - for some reason - be appealing to people in the context of bitcoin, when you can own actual bitcoin instead of the IOU you mention. But people are excited about it because it will make 'investing into bitcoin' a whole lot more accessible to a whole lot of people, which could 'spark' another price bubble. I don't know, maybe they're right. All I know is buying bitcoin by investing into the ETF requires you to trust the ETF. It does not take place on the blockchain, as you say, you hold no keys, and you have no control. The security model of the bitcoin network does not apply to the ETF as I understand it at present. So you are quite right in saying that there is opportunity for fraud - or rather, opportunity to invest into something you are powerless to stop if it goes awry.
3. Treat = threat* - So long as there are major holders of bitcoin (and there always will be, relative to others) this will be a possiblity. Whether it is a threat to bitcoin I dare to doubt. Bitcoin pricing is - for a large part - a market effect. If a powerful party such as a central bank of nation x were to invest a great deal of fiat money they've printed into bitcoin - privately, and attempted to crash the price of the open market, the market would eat that cheap bitcoin like a freshly baked apple pie. Yes, bitcoin would see a (considerable) drop in price, but that drop would be temporary. The party that attempted to crash the price will have lost a considerable amount of money, and more bitcoin will have been distributed to more users that will do something useful with it. The net effect is a positive one. When that same party (or another 'nation x') finished printing more money to buy more bitcoin, the next 'major holder' will not be as major as the last one. And so on. The effect large parties can have diminishes over time.

So again, enter bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-09 03:52:32
Alright. Agreed.
Parsing it some more, and please correct me if I'm wrong:
Assuming miners would (at current rewards) all generate at 75% difficulty to snag the 'cheap' block subsidy ahead of schedule, would the difficulty not increase by 25% at the first adjustment - and perpetually 'force' miners to remain generating at 75% difficulty in order not to lose subsidy until such time that transaction fees arrive at the same ballpark fees are at (or subsidy will halve to). If so, it follows that until such time, block sizes will remain small, prohibiting a fee market to exist or indeed any increase in tx rate without the presence of (extremely high) fees that would counteract the (very high and appealing) subsidy - further pinning the miner's difficulty preference in the 75% corner, and further restrict the block size, and our ability to scale.
Mirroring, when subsidy is negligible, rational miners would always generate at 125% difficulty, allowing them to bag more fees, which would lower difficulty at the next adjustment, again forcing them to remain generating at that level, increasing block limits further and further, forever (because subsidy will never return to counteract this)
It seems to me this could work only if subsidy and fees are fairly well balanced, which currently is far from the case, and in the end (as you mention) cannot be balanced because subsidy will go away.

About half a year ago in a *let's talk bitcoin* episode when sidechains were announced (?) / discussed ( I remember talk about encrypting the *amount* of coins in a transaction output, making it only viewable to the parties involved with the transaction and verifyable to the network using zero knowledge proofs.
In other words, this property will cause us to not be able to see transaction amounts anymore, except for our own transactions, but we will be able to verify that input amounts of all transactions match (or rather, do not exceed) the outputs. Which really is all we need to still rely on the system.
Now that the sidechain paper has been released I've started thinking about this feature some more (which I don't see implemented in vanilla Bitcoin for reasons relating to consensus, but which *can* be realistically implemented in sidechains with no friction).
I believe for an anonymous and privacy centered currency, this property would be a very desirable one to have because current privacy measures we can take involve only obfuscating transaction traffic rather than making transaction information inaccessible to others.
Does anyone know of any work being done in this field, and how it may be applied to sidechains? For example, I wouldn't know how we can move bitcoin from the bitcoin chain to a sidechain that's encrypting its amounts and back, and I'm wondering how this would all work. Thoughts, etc.? Discuss!

Each puzzle is unique to each miner. If not by chance because everyone has a different mempool to pool transactions out of, then because each coinbase transaction will be different because each miner will have another pubkey to spend the block reward to.
Given the following:
- every puzzle is unique
- every attempt at solving it has a set chance of being a correct solution
- the puzzle has no 'memory' (it is a poisson process, meaning that after you've attempted to solve it and failed, you'll start all over again)
- the first past the post is the winner (ignoring orphans for a minute)
means that your chance of winning any given puzzle is proportionate to your hashrate with the network's hashrate.

This is hard to implement because fiat money is not digitally decentralized, which for an exchange makes things more complex to decentralize.

Really, the only thing right now that'll make bitcoin scale in a way it doesn't corrupt the system is the lightning network.
Centralized custodians allow us to scale too, but they introduce trust.
Increasing the blocksize allows us to scale too, but not hugely (and that's gonna have to happen anyway)
Making more compact multisig possible helps us scale aswell, but again not to infinity.
Pruning helps keep storage low, but does nothing for bandwidth.
Headers-first makes the barrier to running a full node lower, but you still need the resources to keep it running.
IBLT makes block propagation scale regardless of size, but still doesn't fix O(m * n) tx propagation scaling problems.
The lightning network allows trustless transacting between peers using the blockchain as a safeguard. That'll help us scale.

This is part of the reason I am so excited about the lightning network and any such technology which we will inevitably be moving toward; trustless transactions without carving them into stone on the blockchain, and falling back to the blockchain only in case of failure or fraud.
The record and proofs of individual - and many-a-time trivial transactions - can only be stored and known to the participants involved; 'you and I and no-one else'; not to all those wishing to validate or analyse the integrity and movement of ownership through the blockchain.

The Bitcoin protocol does not compensate non-proofs of work.
However, pools will accept proofs-of-work of lower-than-valid difficulty (called shares), with some more restrictions on the contents of what is mined (more specifically: the pool composes a block, and gives the necessary parts to a miner to produce a proof-of-work out of, which are parts of the header and parts of the coinbase transaction -- enough to start mining. The Stratum protocol is typically used for this) as proof that a given individual miner has worked a certain amount in their name, and will compensate accordingly.

I think in the future bitcoin will move from being used as a payment network to primarily a settlements network and a platform on top of which notaries may operate. Most transactions would occur over layer-2 technologies such as the lightning network; allowing one to move value trustlessly without touching the blockchain, except in case of failure.
Payouts to millions of creditors can happen without friction and essentially instantly over such networks, but on the bitcoin blockchain as it exists today? Nope.

Ciphertext implies encryption, which does not - well, sort of, but not really - happen in digital signatures.
The plaintext that's being signed in a digital signature can be anything:
In the case of a bitcoin transaction, it's various parts of the transaction (some outputs, all outputs, no outputs) as denoted by the input signature type.
See:  for how signing a transaction works.
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:22:33
No, it's not a different transaction if you haven't alterred it in any way. You're just nudging it along.
In this case it probably wouldn't have worked because the initial transaction contained dust outputs which wallet software should prevent from happening.
If you change the transaction in any way though (ie. Using the same inputs, but changing the outputs), it would have shown up as a double spend.
@_date: 2015-05-12 13:41:33
The real argument against increasing the block size limit is the increased cost of maintaining a full node; the ability to fully validate the contents and ongoing changes of the blockchain, and thus to trustlessly participate in the system.

The protocol has none. Everything in the blockchain and everything transmitted between peers is unencrypted and sent as-is.
All things in the blockchain are (intended to be) immalleable; changing the payload invalidates the result. Either through hard-to-produce proof of work (blocks) or digital signatures (a part of which could be considered encryption, somewhat, but not quite as a whole) for transactions (this is also the 'intended to be' bit - malleability in transactions is kind of possible, but it doesn't change the meaning of a transaction, only the format).
This is why transmitting everything as-is without encryption is completely safe and we don't need encryption for the protocol.
We do often use encryption to keep private keys and other secrets safe from theft or otherwise, but none of this is part of the protocol.

1) There's no official or well known ratification process as such. But contributing code, thought and expertise on how to move the project forward is probably the first step.
2) 2, 5, 17, 41 - there's no way to tell, really.
3) Tough to answer because it's mostly irrelevant. I'd say they contribute code they themselves feel is appropriate to contribute from their technical point of view, if the contribution is deemed useful or positive by the other devs it is included in the Bitcoin Core project. If the community and those participating by running the software deem the software package as a whole useful and aligned with the rules they agree with, it is adopted by individual participants.
4) Only if those companies also actively influence social media outlets or activity thereon to align the community's views with their own. Which is plausible, though I like to think people can think for themselves.
5) Good or bad arguments for and/or against and better or worse rebuttals leading the core devs to reach consensus.

I do.
I'm not arguing to get rid of the limit, I'm arguing that when the time comes that 20MB is, again, insufficient, I will not be enjoying the discussion at that time. Ask yourself this, how would setting a limit we agree we can live with, *like* 20MB and increasing at an x rate, allow the bitchy-miner-generates-exorbitantly-large-blocks-attack to happen. It certainly wouldn't be a *severe* disruption of bitcoin, nor would it result in centralization. Why? Because we all knew blocks hitting that limit would be a possibility, we all agreed and knew beforehand we would and should be able to handle it, then how could it possibly be a problem?
I said this:


Using all the information I have now, if I can reasonably say that in 10 years I will be able to handle 1 gig blocks (just taking a number here, don't read anything into it), and we implement the rule such that in 10 years 1 gig blocks will be allowed. Then I can either be wrong, the network will actually run into that limit, or both. Only if 'both' is the case do we have a problem, which is when we correct the false prediction.
I don't know about anyone else, but I'd rather take a (dare I say) gamble (which can be a very safe gamble by making a very conservative prediction, which is perfectly fine) than have the same shitty discussion we have today in another 5 years. A hard fork is the last thing we'd want to be doing in bitcoin, and by *just* increasing the limit to 20MB and nothing else we'll only be setting ourselves up for another one.
As for *actual* scaling solutions (and increasing the block size limit is not one of them), we focus our attention on the lightning network, the stroem thing Mike Hearn was talking about, micropayments, etc. This whole block size discussion is *not* interesting.

I'll have to play the devil's advocate here for a bit though: it's trivially easy to make any stolen coins untraceable.
- Mixing services scramble coins with tons of other coins belonging to tons of other people, doing this repeatedly will swiftly distribute the stolen coins to other owners that have no relation to the thieves.
- CoinJoin transactions can do the same thing completely without trust.
- Buying altcoins through any of the (decentralized) exchanges, essentially results in the same thing; unidentifiable coins.
Yes, coins are traceable, but the identity of the owner - if this was ever public - can be scrambled to the point it's impossible to make heads or tails of any it.

The private key space is (a little less than) 2^256 . If you pick any random number in this range the chance of someone else randomly picking that same number is practically zero. Even if all current and future computers we will ever build would, in a joint effort, start *counting* from zero all the way up to 2^256 , they will not finish before our sun dies out.
Imagine you pick a random person on earth, consider the chance of someone else randomly picking this person. It's negligible. Now observe that this selection space is *only* 7 billion, a number with 9 zeroes. 2^256 has 77 zeroes. It's *just* too big.

In the 6 years that bitcoin has existed, this set of data has grown to 355934 * 80 bytes, or ~28MB. Would've been 280MB at 1min intervals. No big deal either way.
And since it's linearly growing, as you say, it's entirely manageable considering the cost for storage will likely continue to drop exponentially.
Further, it's possible to compress the headers somewhat:
4 byte version can be reduced to a few bits, or compressed in a smart way where they can be omitted entirely
The 4 byte difficulty may be discarded entirely and be computed out of the timestamps every 2016 blocks.
timestamp may be represented as an offset to the previous timestamp, or something similar, reducing this to 2 bytes or so.
Saves up to 12 bytes every block, or a 15% reduction, but that's about as far as you can go.
// edit: Oh and the prev block header can be ~~reduced to a few bytes (8 or less)~~ discarded, netting you another ~~~24~~ 32 bytes, totalling a ~~45%~~ ~55% reduction.

BU is an alternative client which implements an alternative protocol that shares much of the same rules. For that reason, it currently tracks the same blockchain as the Bitcoin blockchain. Depending on the BU node's configuration, the only difference between a BU block and a Bitcoin block is its possible size and, with that, its validity:
A BU block can be larger than a Bitcoin block's maximum size, which would make it invalid.
If such an invalid block is ever created by a BU node, it would immediately be ignored and discarded from the Bitcoin network by Bitcoin nodes. BU nodes, on the other hand, consider such a block valid, and they would continue to build on top of it -- until it is reorganised out of *their* chain (it is important to note here, that at this point, the chain that block is a part of is no longer a Bitcoin chain). And this reorganisation may never happen if a majority of miners are creating blocks using BU nodes that are configured to accept and/or build them.
However, the Bitcoin blockchain would not include these blocks, and effectively the networks would split and show their distinctiveness when a majority of miners create BU blocks (blocks that are larger than the Bitcoin network allows).
For this reason, it is important to run your own node so that you can objectively verify that your money is, in fact, the money you want it to be.
There are no 8MB blocks in the blockchain.

"Incredibly small" is an understatement. The value space is *unfathomably* large; the odds of anyone creating a single collision even using all past, present and future computers ever to be created during our sun's lifetime is still 'essentially' zero.
That said, and like you say, it is &gt;0. In fact, many collisions have been generated by different individuals in the past, mostly through (intentional or otherwise) incompetence, stupidity or honest mistakes by not using a proper random number generator with sufficient entropy, or just 'choosing' an extremely simple number as an 'account's' private key, which can trivially be pre-computed by any attacker.
So, not only did it happen once, it's happened many times. The system still exists.
But, for a collision to ever happen for legitimate reason: 2 people randomly creating the same 256 bit number. Nope. Not gonna happen. Never. It's exactly like 2 people flipping a coin 256 times and getting the same result all of those times: never going to happen. The value space is *simply* too large.

The reason miners join a pool is because they want more frequent and predictable (but lower) payouts.
Say you're a solo miner and you mine a block every month, you'll earn 25 BTC monthly on average. Sometimes there'll be 2 months in between payouts, sometimes you find 2 blocks in the same month; it evens out over the long run, but payouts are far and wide apart, and you don't like it.
By joining a pool which totals 25x your hashing power, that pool will find a block just about daily. You'll be given 1 BTC roughly every day, likewise, sometimes it'll be 2 days apart, sometimes it's twice every day, it evens out all the same, the payments will just be more frequent (and less).
Both yield an equivalent amount of bitcoin, but joining a pool pays out more reliably, and more frequently than the other option.
Reducing the block time to 1 min essentially multiplies the frequency at which miners are paid 10-fold, increasing the barrier at which a solo-miner would (for the sake of reliability) be better off joining a pool.

Ok. So it looks like it isn't for political/ideological reasons.
Because of storage? Or bandwidth? Or computing power (if applicable to your provider)?
If the first, would pruning not solve your problem?
If the second, future releases will likely contain rate limiting which allows you to decide/configure how much bandwidth to consume.
If the last, libsecp256k is about 5-6 times more efficient doing signature checking.
Would any of those measures solve it for you?
@_date: 2015-05-10 11:17:35
There is little evidence the reason for this is bandwidth, or any other cost, in the first place. Might as well be people moving away from using Core as a wallet.
Further, 20MB blocks are hardly a strain on bandwidth. To say they can only be run in data centers is nonsense.
Third, changing(/increasing) the block size limit is a hard fork change. You can see the friction this is met with by the very discussion this community has been having for the past few days. Changing the limit to something exactly we need (as in: it moves just ahead of our consumption) is not only impossible to predict, but dangerous; any sudden increase in our requirements could result in needless backlogs.
It's a limit we must all agree to be fine with bearing, yet hope and work not to run into.

Yes. This is asymmetric cryptography in a nutshell. It is what digital signatures use to create and verify signatures.
But, encryption is obscuring data in a way it cannot be interpreted by someone who does not have access to a decryption key. Digital signatures do not obscure any data - the signed message is sent in plain text and the 'encrypted' digest sent along with it does not keep any data secret. Digital signatures are not considered encryption in the sense that they keep data from being interpreted.

To clarify: By prices you mean fees, and by supply you mean space in blocks.
I believe it's utter nonsense to think this will happen. Miners still need to make a living, users still want their transactions/settlements confirmed in reasonable time and the network as a whole is still in agreement that mining requires subsidy of some form, fees will not simply go away just because the block size is not a factor.

Ah, you're talking about UTXO commitments.
The idea here was to put a utxo merkle root in the block (somewhere) and allow transactions verifying that proof from some DHT network.
I do believe the idea to store an UTXO commitment in the *block headers* has been abandoned. If anywhere, it'd likely end up in the coinbase tx.


Well enforcing any utxo commitments would have to be a soft fork change, as such it needs to be done right. To put it bluntly, there's probably better ways to go about doing this that bring forth more advantages than 'just' being able to sync faster.
There's plenty of work in this area, albeit mostly behind the scenes.

The block size limit is a hard limitation on the size of blocks imposed by an early version of bitcoin core to ensure the barrier to fully validating the blockchain and bitcoin network is sufficiently low that essentially anyone can do it. By setting the limit to 1MB, practically anyone with any device was able to fully participate while protecting the growing network from potential DoS or otherwise harmful attacks.
Now, we're about to bump into this limit for what appear to be legitimate reasons; the network has grown such that 1MB blocks are justified.
Because this limit was imposed so (relatively) long ago, while the network has grown so much in the past few years, the rule has become a rather pesky limit which is now hard to get rid of in a way everyone agrees is the best or correct way to do.
Because nobody, nor a strong majority, for now, agrees what to do; nothing happens. This is both one of bitcoin's strengths, aswell as (in this case) its weakness.
The problem we're bumping into is that the network, by its own rules, will only permit about 3-4 transactions per second. Ideally, judging by what most agree with, we should be able to do much more, in order to accomodate much more activity and provide more value and utility to the network.
The solution is to change the rules we all agree exist and are valid. But this presents us with another problem, which we refer to as a 'hard fork'; we'll be changing bitcoin in a way it isn't compatible with the way it used to work, which means we'll make previous versions of the protocol incompatible with the new / proposed versions. Anyone running an older version of the bitcoin protocol / software will (assuming a hard fork) be discarded from the network (as far as their participation goes), which is a big problem considering bitcoin is supposed to be a network which doesn't require you to conform to anyone's thoughts or ideas or rules.
If we can agree on a way to change the rules such that everyone is happy (which many people are working on) or can at least accept the way we change things; nothing bad will happen. But so long as we are not in agreement in the way we will change things (if at all) we will only fragment the network and the community if undesirable changes are continued to be pushed.
Eventually though, this problem will be solved and put behind us, one way or another.

If this is the scheme I think it is, then it is important to note that these nodes will have to operate under the assumption that some majority of their peers is honest. In contrast, full nodes currently trust nothing.
That said. This method of dividing the load nodes must bear will help the bitcoin network scale tremendously well compared to the current situation where everyone bears everything. It would solve the O(n^2) tx scaling problem we are currently stuck with, but it will do this in a way it introduces trust.
I suppose both methods of validating could exist at the same time, though.

A 256 bit key means there's 2^256 possible combinations of this key. The size of this number is so great our puny little human minds cannot comprehend it.
In decimal, it's a number 77 digits long. If my computer could increment a counter by 100 **billion** *every single second*, it would take my computer **10^63 years** to count to this number. If every human on earth would have a computer like mine, it would still take **10^50 YEARS** for the distributed power of all those computers combined to cover all numbers below the total number of possibilities. If all computers would be 100 billion times faster in 5 years, it would still take **10^39 YEARS** to reach this number.
The effort this would take, which is only *counting* the total the number of possibilities, let alone matching the resulting public key address to an existing address containing bitcoin (which would take much much more effort than only counting would) would easily cover the power of the sun over its remaining lifetime. This is true.
Now, why is it so easy for a device like the Mycelium Entropy or the Trezor or your 10 year old laptop, or a 6-sided-die, to generate an address? Because such a device need only generate 1 of all the possible addresses.
If you throw 6-sided die 99 times, you will have generated as much entropy (entropy is a method of quantifying complexity in a unit) as a 256-bit key. Every time you throw a 6-sided die, you're increasing the entropy thus far by a factor of 6. Throwing it 99 times means you've created 6^99 bits of entropy, or 1.088...*10^77, or about 2^256.

Blocks are generated like a poisson distribution.
Put simply (in the context of mining), a poisson distribution is something where every second there's a chance of something happening (the generation of a valid block), the next second the chance of that something happening is the exact same. Depending on the chance of that something happening, you can very accurately predict the rate at which 'something' happens. (actual poisson distrubitions are a little more abstract, but ah)
In the case of bitcoin, the difficulty adjustments 'retarget' the rate at which blocks are generated to 10 minutes *on average*.
When you monitor the bitcoin network and start to observe blocks being generated which, over a period of preferably a longer time - to eliminate 'bad luck', do not align with the targeted 10 minute poisson distribution, you can quite confidently state something has gone awry. Note that you will not only check to see if the average block time is 10 minutes, but also whether the rate at which they are coming in looks like a poisson distribution - which is key.
What's gone wrong could be anything. One of those things might be that you are being fed blocks by a (rather large) attacker which has put your node in isolation, because blocks are coming in much slower than usual. It could mean a (large) miner is withholding blocks from the network, and is trying to perform a less-than-51%-attack (because blocks will come in very soon after another). It could mean you are poorly connected to the network. It could mean the network has legitimately been having an extraordinarily bad streak of luck (which given time is more and more unlikely).
In most cases a human operator could quite accurately pinpoint the exact problem and remedy it, but let's assume for a second you are - for example - an atonomously operating - ownerless - program - a piece of software - which depends and transacts on the blockchain. You will have no ability to intelligently determine the cause of the problem, or even the ability to know there is a problem without this method of detecting a dishonest or otherwise poorly performing network, nor remedy it, but you *will* know there is a problem, at which point you may scream murder and fire and act accordingly, such as cease your operation, be more cautious before accepting transactions, etc. - until the network looks healthy once more.

I feel it's becoming increasingly important to understand the way bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies achieve decentralized consensus. Understanding the code of Bitcoin Core, other implementations, and other platforms relevant to the space (ie. BitcoinJ) are a huge plus, but understanding what all this code is achieving is much more important if you're gonna start developing for the space.
Similar to the internet, the number of ways you can create a product the wrong way in bitcoin is staggering. No amount of knowing how to program on top of existing architecture is gonna help you build the right product the correct way.
The same applies to cryptography in general. The way it works or is implemented isn't as important as understanding what it does and exactly for what purpose.
Generally though, the best way to fundamentally understand something is to know how it works. So I guess what I'm saying is, is that whatever you do, try to *understand* what it does, and for what reason, rather than just *knowing*.

For cloud mining, hashing power is both directly and indirectly under the control of the cloud mining provider rather than the person that paid for it (cloud mining provider controls the machines). Whereas for pooled mining, hashing power is only indirectly under the control of the pool (the individual owning the hashpower can always direct the machines elsewhere).
'Pools' like HaoBTC are funded mostly through what can be considered cloud mining contracts, and therefore is an example of an entity that has free and total reign over the hashrate it churns out, while not being the owner of said hashrate, making them responsible only for payouts to their investors.

The birthday paradox/problem describes that it's highly probable that at least one pair of n randomly chosen people share a birthday, with a counter-intuitively low number n, and where birthdays are distributed randomly across the range.
Putting 23 randomly chosen people in the same room, pushes the probability of at least 2 of them having the same birthday to 50%. Which may seem weird for such a small amount of people.
This is the birthday paradox/problem.
In cryptography, this can be interpreted as a possible attack vector which may reduce the number of attempts needed to 'crack' a hash, or something similar that's "equally or randomly distributed".
For example, when I am in possession of a collection of hashes for a collection of arbitrary data, and I am looking for the origin values of these hashes, I may proceed to attack this by hashing arbitrary/random data, and checking if the result is contained in the collection of hashes. This drastically increases my odds of finding an origin value for at least 1, or a few, of the hashes (but likely not all, or many) in the collection I'm attacking.
The same is true for bitcoin addresses.
But the space of these values is simply much much too large for even this attack vector to matter in a significant way.

How so? Every transaction is interpreted the same. There's a scriptpubkey and a scriptsig, evaluated like &lt;scriptsig&gt; &lt;scriptpubkey&gt; for each an every tx.
But then there's P2SH transactions, identified by checking if the scriptpubkey is of the format HASH160/OP20+data/EQUAL, in which case the scriptsig alone is evaluated in addition to what normally happens.
I'd much rather clients not have any knowledge of what type of transactions exist. They'd just be evaluating &lt;scriptsig&gt;&lt;scriptpubkey&gt; and be done with it, which is why P2SH is weird.

Strictly speaking, you are never anonymous in bitcoin. You are pseudonymous at best. It's pretty much the same thing so long as your pseudonymity is not connected to your identity.
Here's some type of wallets that (can) exist:
- SPV wallets
Simple wallet not doing any verification, trusting a node to provide truthful information (partly verifyable, but not as trustless or secure a P2P wallet). Can be implemented such that *trusted* nodes can infer information about your spending behavior. Can also be implemented such that this be made hard if not impossible.
Uses the same address which is extremely bad for your privacy and bad practice in general.
- SPV / HD wallets
Same as above, except that it uses a different address for each transaction: Good for privacy and good practice.
- Web wallets
Can be made to know everything about you. You have to rely on the web wallet to be available unless you have backups which may or may not (depending on how it's offered / how you've done it) be crappy for security.
Uses the same address which is extremely bad for your privacy and bad practice in general.
- Web HD wallets
Same as SPV / HD wallets note.
- Peer-to-peer wallets
- Peer-to-peer HD wallets
Fully verifying wallet, everything down to the genesis block, requires minimal (if any) trust.
HD wallets are good for privacy. etc. etc.
- Hybrid custodial wallets
Wallets for which you provide a cosign. Requires third party wallet provider to remain available to you, or to script transactions such that they become available to you (alone) at a later date (through locktimes and such)
- Full custodial wallets
No privacy. No keys. Maximum trust. No control. No way to prevent coins from being lost through no fault of your own. No responsibility (even if you wanted to).
As to anonymity, some pointers:
HD wallets preserve your privacy better than reusing addresses does. The latter is a crap practice still employed by several wallets, avoid it. Still though, connections may be drawn for HD wallets 
There are also some methods to obfuscate the ownership of coins, such as CoinJoin (trustless mixing) or mixing services (trusted mixing). This mixes your coins with coins of other bitcoin users. Depending on how long you keep this up, which user owns which coins becomes completely untraceable through blockchain analysis.
Then there's exposing your IP when broadcasting a transaction. You can use Tor for full anonymity. For SPV and P2P wallets you will have to trust nodes to deal with your IP responsibly although they can only make (pretty good) assumptions that any given transaction originates from you. For web wallets and custodial wallets you will have to trust the web wallet provider to deal with your IP responsibly.
// Edit: Tor is fine for P2P wallets, and to a lesser extent SPV wallets. It is not fine for web wallets unless you access them them through a hidden service; never through an exit node.

That'd be the order book / market depth. Big fat green 'bubble'/line means there's a bunch of buy orders below market price, big fat red bubble means there's a bunch of sell orders above market price.
The thinner the red line, the less resistance for demand to push through those price levels, and vice versa.

In fact all you need is the unspent transaction output list. There's no such thing as "balances" in bitcoin, only the aggregate amount of transaction outputs that may be spent by what we've come to call the owner of an address.
The blockchain itself also doesn't really "know" about addresses too, it only knows about transactions. We "program" the address into the transaction using a little script which is evaluated by everyone in the network to determine if the transaction is valid or not.

- I use Blockchain for my hot wallet, got my friends to use Mycelium wallet.
- Bar inserted EUR amount into a dedicated payment-phone which spat out a QR code which I'd scan. Send. Done. A second later the payment would be received, bar-phone would say 'thank you for your payment'. Not sure which payment provider this is, if any, didn't look like bitpay or coinbase.
- No time delay, seeing the transaction being broadcast through the network was enough for this PoS merchant/bar (as it should be).
- All of them, I was on WiFi myself.
- They get their BTC over the payment network, of course, if they convert to EUR it's either through a payment provider or they do it manually (which I doubt)
- Couldn't tell you, didn't ask, but I'm assuming they're using a payment provider
- The current exchange rate is pulled when paying, if they convert instantly they wouldn't feel a thing.
- Simply increase the amount inserted into the payment-phone with the tip, I reckon.

Really though, although it might be artificial, if the destination can be encoded as a 20 byte / hash160 outpoint, there's no reason it cannot be encoded as 'just' a new address type - say, an 8-address type. Existing wallets would need to do entirely different things, sure, but that's a matter of implementation.
Just like 1-addresses are translated to op_dup op_hash160 [addr] etc., and 3-addresses are op_hash160 [addr] op_equal. A user doesn't have to care about any of that; the address encoded is 'just' a destination of some action.

Here's a block which has the 8MB preference signal:
There's no protocol, or special format to put these in that has any protocol relevance, it's just miners putting in some bytes that form '8MB', indicating that's their apparent preference.

I'm only slightly worried about this at the moment. Services such as changetip provide centralized off-chain payments solutions, which means they can run away with the loot, have their holdings stolen, or stop processing at their discretion. We have to trust them. Advantages, though, is the extreme convenience to transmit value to random inhabitants of the internet at the press of a button. Taking the nature of ChangeTip into account - dealing only with tipping amounts - I'm fine with the disadvantages. Anything other than that I'd stay away from.


Contrary to off-chain transactions, these guys cannot steal funds at the consumer-end and employs a model that requires less trust. I'm totally fine with their 'stealing the spotlight'. Would be nice to have open-source software running it, distributed and open hosting, and a not-for-profit organisation/foundation running it though - which would require even less trust.

*(text decoration mine)*
I'm not sure I agree with you there specifically.
I'd say the money supply needs to increase (and decrease) with the total value of the economy the money is used in in order to result in stable prices. Which is supremely hard to measure or predict and will therefore always lag.
The next-best thing is a money supply that's fixed, or predictable regardless of changing variables. And definitely not something that changes arbitrarily based on the decision of anything other than the market.
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:58:53


This is not the deflation we're talking about when we're talking about lost coins. Lost coins - for all intents and purposes - reduce the monetary base, making all left-over money more valuable. This is what is meant when we're talking about a deflationary currency, not the reduction in price levels of goods (note though, *if* the overall *value* of the currency/money remains equal, then reduced prices of goods are an *effect* of the deflation of the monetary base - but it is not the cause).
The modern definitions commonly used for inflation and deflation - measured by increase and decrease in prices of goods - are just plain wrong if you ask me. It should be measured by the monetary base, not prices of rather arbitrary goods.
In bitcoin, for example, I could buy a pizza for, say, 1 BTC in 2012, but today a pizza would cost me only 0.1BTC.
The price has decreased 10-fold! This currency is so deflationary it's crazy! Right? Wrong. The monetary base has increased by ~30% in that period; the currency has *inflated*. But the *value* of the money has not remained equal in this time period, it has increased &gt;10-fold; the price reduction of my precious pizza is therefore an effect of the *value* of the currency (in a given economy) increasing - *not* deflation.
Further, I don't believe deflationary spirals even exist. Unless of course reduction of the monetary base causes more coins to be destroyed, causing more coins to be destroyed, causing more coins to be destroyed - which in the case of bitcoin (or anything I know), is not the case.

Bloom filters, put simply, allow you to query data in a way that it returns a lot of false positives which the one who created the query can check for, but the supplier cannot.
Analogous to asking "give me the call history of all phone numbers that contain '4892'".
You're actually only looking for the call history of the phone number '16548926288', but you're asking for the history of all phone numbers containing a part of that. So you'll get a lot more data than you need, but you only fish out the data you need locally.
I can't read the paper because of the paywall, but what I'm thinking they discovered is that doing a lot of queries for a lot of addresses, reveals all of them:


This makes sense. For example, if I would have 20 phone numbers which sometimes call eachother, and I query a node for each of these numbers with a bloom filter, a node could infer which phone numbers I'm really looking for based on which of the numbers they're returning have called each other in the past. The exact same thing applies to bitcoin addresses.
You could fix it (rather, bandage it) by making the bloom filter more abstract; asking for less 'numbers' that match, increasing the amount of false positives returned to you and making it exponentially harder for the providing party to infer connections.
You can also 'fix' it by only querying nodes you trust or own.
// Edit: Neither of these 'fixes' are very satisfactory. So this probably needs some research going forward. The paper's abstract suggests they've come up with a solution, which I'm curious about.


// Edit2: You could, of course, also fix it by making sure the addresses you're querying for have no past connections to eachother. Unfortunately this is quite hard to do in bitcoin without mixing of any kind.
Great question.

There is not a single proposal out there that can provide instant on-chain certainty over an unconsented state of the ledger. The problem is fundamental, irrefutable, and the solution Bitcoin proper provides works only given time, which incidentally is the best any other proposal can hope to do.

Partial blocks, sub chains, thin blocks, weak blocks, NG. None of those proposals are solutions, they can't be, they are not even close to the correct approach to a solution.

It doesn't.
The number of possible addresses is simply too large (2^160, about 10^49) to be concerned with this.
Even if there were a billion times a billion times a billion addresses (10^27) in use (which won't even be possible because there aren't enough bitcoin units to even give each of these a single satoshi), it would still be a fraction of a tiny fraction of an even smaller fraction of the total amount possible.
Even the birthday paradox doesn't stand a chance against the sheer hugeness of the total amount of possible addresses. It's a non-issue.

True, key word being *'caused'*. But loss of purchasing power does *not* automatically mean the currency is inflating.

Well. People are still using gold, but instead of using it as a means of exchange, they're using it primarily as a store of value. Turns out gold is quite heavy and tough to transport, easily lost or stolen when not stored in a vault, hard to divide on the fly. Not ideal for currency, but excellent as value. Then someone came up with paper notes, the guy figured that if the note said it was worth an x amount of some other money, like gold, it'd eliminate many disadvantages of gold as a currency. And it did. Much joy. Then people figured these paper notes may well have also been money, so then paper notes were money. Then, later, the paper note was given a different meaning; instead of 'this paper note is worth an x amount of gold' it said 'this paper note is worth a paper note'. Then computers came running round the corner, and many paper notes started living in there. The computer basically said 'your paper note is in here, I'll give it to you if you say so'. Transfer of these digital paper notes was easy, because it was digital. Printing these digital paper turned out to be even easier, because the owner of the computer could just tell multiple owners of the digital paper notes he was good for it, and continue to use the digital paper notes himself, and lend it out to others with interest. The same has been happening for ages but not with as little friction. Then when multiple digital paper note owners asked the computer owner for their paper note, the computer owner didn't, to everyone's surprise, have enough paper notes handy. And all was sad. Then the guy who invented the paper note figured they'd just buy some debt at the computer owner, and the computer owner could give out some paper notes to the paper note owners again. And all was happy. Then the computer owner continued lending out the digital paper notes to all that wanted it, and all was going smooth. This repeats for a while.
Then Bitcoin came running round the corner. And it's like gold. It's exactly like gold. Except digital. It's not a digital paper note, it's a digital gold. And the next time a digital computer owner lending out the digital gold people trust him with turns out not to have enough digital gold to give to the ones trusting him with it, he will go broke, and lose a lot of money. And the digital gold owners will realize they need to take a modicum of responsibility over the digital gold they're owning. They realize they cannot trust willy nilly computer owners with their money. They realize that when they themselves take control of their money, they themselves have stake in how their money is used, or lent. They realize this stake in participation may just make for a much more healthy economical climate. They realize the future is bright.
And all will be well. And all will be well.

No, security would be the same in the long run.
There's a higher risk of reorganizations at the tip which makes some edge case attacks more plausible.
The block reward would be reduced to 2.5 BTC and halved periodically as usual; the hard cap of 21 mil coins remains unchanged.
It could invite miners to geographically centralize because at 1 min conf. times it's more important than ever to get your block to propagate and reach other miners, which might result in miners centralizing. On the other hand, more frequent blocks also incentivizes solo-mining, or mining at small scale somewhat. Could go either way.

Currently, large blocks propagate through the network slower than small blocks do. The slower block propagation is, the less likely it is you will get the mining reward. Thus, miners are now incentivized to generate small blocks. Invertible bloom lookup tables allow blocks to propagate at constant time, regardless of their size. This takes away the incentive for miners to keep blocks small.

You are spreading FUD as usual. Your conveniently capitalized ANYONECANSPEND is a widespread misnomer - it can be spent under *the old validation rules*, this does not mean it is spendable under the new ones; and it isn't. The format is non-standard; it will not propagate easily, disregarding that: no existing miner will mine them.
Presuming segwit activation is successful, then no such transaction will be mined/confirmed under *non-adversarial* conditions. Presuming adversarial conditions, then *no such transaction will garner a high number of confirmations*.
Contrast that with the HF alternative, and an adversary will be able to churn out confirmations on any number of invalid segwit transactions to old nodes, and those old nodes will be left exposed indefinitely until upgraded.
If your argument is that everyone should upgrade for this feature introduction, then you are, of course, entirely correct. However I feel you are arguing a HF is superior, in which case you are wholly incorrect.
**You know all of this**. This debate has been had. There is technical consensus over the upgrade mechanism. You spend every waking hour following Bitcoin and its developments.

Throwing away fees and reducing block reward is technically identical: in both cases, bitcoin are denied the ability of existing, never to be seen again, whereas an OP_RETURN output visibly locks an amount for eternity.
Fees and block reward are conflated into a single number and, as such, can be regarded to equally.

When you replace consensus of peers with consensus imposed on you by a single authority, essentially what you'll have is Bitcoin where a single miner has majority mining power, along with unilateral decisions regarding changes to the protocol (which Bitcoin is not prone to).
But so long as it's still math down below you'd still be able to prove, to anyone and beyond doubt, that a transaction originated from you and cannot be forged or altered, for example.
Or the ability to conditionalize value expenditure based on arbitrary conditions; programmability of money.
Or the elimination of single points of failure in terms of downtime / inavailability of the network.
There's a ton of perks a distributed ledger with a bitcoin/blockchain-like architecture can accomplish outside of the voluntary / permissionless / trustless stuff.


I'd say banks (or anyone) holds gold because it's scarce, in addition to neutral. But yeah.
They'd hold Fedcoin or another digital dollar kind of token because the Fed says they should and/or they are trusted to maintain its value. It's how the dollar works now.

It's a way for anyone to pay anyone instantly, securely, trustlessly and without touching the blockchain. It's like micropayments channels turned into a network. It makes it possible to transact using bitcoin in an entirely new way such that it can easily scale to tens of thousands of transactions per second.
Only when some party in the network becomes uncooperative does the blockchain come into play, to settle the payments.
Check out:
It requires a soft fork that introduces some new types of signatures and fixes some malleability possibilities. So that's how it affects bitcoin directly.

Because transactions need to be relayed through the network in order to arrive at miners.
However, that is of no concern to a node who is interested in following the best valid chain in order to transact with other people or entities. Such a node is interested only in valid blocks and desires not to be bothered by another's transactions.

A sidechain is a completely separate chain which allows its tokens to be pegged to the bitcoin/main chain at a known ratio/algorithm. Its state is secured through merged mining, which means a main-chain proof-of-work is sufficient to generate a valid sidechain block, but at the sidechain's difficulty rather than the main chain's.
Tokens/bitcoins may be moved from one chain to the other and back.
It's not piggy backing because miners need to explicitly mine an extra chain, whether or not this (merge mining) is desirable for sidechains is debatable. (so far I'm thinking no, but we'll see)
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:15:19


Correct. The difference is that we know that the outcome of a difficulty adjustment will result in a value which will cause the network to produce a block roughly every 10 minutes. That is the certainty.
Karp's proposal produces a value which will mean little, we cannot predict, nor can depend upon to be suitable.


See above, this is because the difficulty is irrelevant for the result we are trying to pursue, which is the confirmation time.


I think those arguments are sound. Although I do tend to disagree with him saying a fee market in and of itself will not work.
My thinking is that a fee market enforced by an artificial block limit will not work, for the most part because I think transactions will become too expensive while I believe everyone wants them to  be dirt cheap, and they can, while still providing sufficient subsidy, given scale. A fee market *unencumbered* by us hitting the block limit (as in, we're nowhere near filling up blocks) I believe is entirely viable. I have a long unfinished argument in my head to show this involving [banana's]( but I'll write that up later.

Suppose I give you control over the majority of the hashrate in bitcoin.
Now, change a rule.
You can't. You'll fork.
You can attack it, sure; this is not disputed, but you *cannot* change a rule. Only consensus changes rules, thus, you do not have consensus. You are not in control. Simple.
Please do note this: I'm not saying you cannot attack a chain with majority hashrate. I wholeheartedly agree that you can. There's little - that we know of - you can do about it even with horse tranquilizers. At best you can mitigate an attack, or bandage the wounds, until the attacker inevitably runs out of resources or realizes it's best to play along.
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:42:15
Fundamentally, consensus that certain blocks having certain specific - and hard to find - attributes are eligible to be included in the blockchain, is how transactions are included in the blockchain. Hashrate will only make it more likely that you will come up with those blocks, and, yes, *can* be the only one to come up with new blocks if you have majority. But no rule will change.
Anyway, I'm fine with agreeing to disagree. I'm gonna take off now and have a beer.

This miner knows nothing about the contents of the block. The pool assembles it unilaterally. It could censor transactions, partake in things like mining contracts, double-spend contracts, virgin coin futures etc.
Hell, the pool could be letting miners work on a parallel chain, or invalid blocks, or an altcoin. And the miner might not agree with this, or even know, nor see a share of these added profits, or he might not even see *any* profits until he finds out. He is completely and utterly in the dark.

There's this idea that alternate implementations can't identically reproduce Bitcoin Core's consensus code (forks excepted). Btcd for example was built from the ground up in Go, and while it has performed admirably and without error, there is no way to prove it is bug-for-bug compatible with Core's consensus code (that is, it functions identically under all conditions).
As a result, depending on these alternate implementations as a business is potentially dangerous.
Libconsensus is a (work-in-progress) library that does all consensus-critical operations. Tx verification, block header verification, signature validation, and maintaining the UTXO set. Basically the bare metals needed to construct a fully validating Bitcoin node on top. When this library is available, building alternate implementations would be a breeze.
But it needs a *lot* of work, and currently there are too few developers working on it. Jorge Timon is the only one I know of.
Considering the many outcries for alternate implementations here on Reddit and elsewhere: working on this library is the place to start with achieving that.

Sure, but to say that when there was no limit it 'led' to 'huge problems' is just plain false. You're misleading people here. There were no huge problems, [there have never been exorbitantly large blocks]( The cap was not introduced for that reason. It was introduced to prevent that from happening, sure, and it was a good enough temporary measure at that time. It made sure the network wouldn't be generating unreasonably large blocks through, essentially, a soft fork. A cap of 1MB was reasonable at the time, and it was always the intention to be removed.
Now that such block sizes are becoming more and more normal, it is time to revise the rule. Not to remove it, but to modify it in a way we aren't gonna bump into it for legitimate reasons.

I think Ripple is a good development in general. It allows you to move money frictionlessly to any peer through trusted parties at near-zero cost. Its consensus ledger, contrary to bitcoin, is based on trusted peers rather than proof of work performed (PoW). As such, one could argue bitcoin requires less trust than the ripple network does.
Ripple tokens (XRP) have been premined (sort of) and most of them are still in possession of Ripple Labs, a central party overseeing, but not controlling, the network. As such, one could argue ripple is not decentralized (rather, it's distributed).
The ripple network is very cheap to run though, it requires no mining, only communication between peers. So no valuable electricity is wasted into doing useless work, like in Bitcoin.
Ripple tokens, to my knowledge, are not programmable in the way bitcoins are. You are therefore less flexible in conditioning transactions which - in my opinion - *severely* limits its utility. Its transactions are explicitly typed in a way bitcoin is not limited. Essentially (currently) allowing it only to function as a money transmitter, and not any of Bitcoin's potential applications such as (smart) contracts, notaries, complex scripts, multisig, etc.
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:46:44
Technically this is very hard to do. In fact, if we would be able to do this technically we wouldn't need proof-of-work to come to consensus to begin with.
The reason is time. Bitcoin nodes potentially don't agree on exactly what time it is. My peers could lie about what time it is, I could lie to them about what time it is, or good old fashioned latency could skew the time I'm reporting to my peers, or them to me. We cannot determine whether they are lying, whether I'm wrong, or whether it's just lag. Further, we cannot determine whether they know that I know what time they think it is, etc. There's no way to agree on an exact time in a decentralized and trustless system.
*If* we could somehow all agree on the time, we could simply stick all transactions in the ledger at the time they were broadcast and forever be done with it; needing no work to be performed on top of it in order to remain permanent. They could not be reversed anyway, because we all agree on what time it is, and if we know a transaction occurred before the time we know it is; a transaction cannot be overwritten/double-spent/erased.
Sadly, this is not the case, and we use *proof-of-work* rather than *time* to take care of ordering events in the ledger.
As such, we will never be able to agree on whether it's been 30 minutes since the last block.

The confirmation time is quite arbitrary. When Satoshi created the protocol, 10 minutes seemed like a good time period to reach consensus in the network. He hasn't been wrong about this so far.
Some altcoins have chosen shorter confirmation times, others (although few) longer ones.
Transactions are encumbered by the time it takes to propagate through the network; unfortunately due to an upper limit at which information may travel, propagation *cannot* be instant, which is why we need some time before the network can be in agreement of the state of the blockchain. Confirmation times of a few seconds will only cause inevitable and constant forks at the tip of the chain for this reason.
Further, for the proof-of-work algorithm used in bitcoin and most altcoins, we need time to perform work which makes transactions irreversible (or rather, less reversible). A number of confirmations on a chain with confirmation times of few minutes are therefore more reversible than the same number of confirmations on bitcoin's 10 minute chain. In the end, all that matters is the amount of work it takes to reverse a transaction, which - assuming equal hashrate - is the same for all chains, regardless of confirmation times.

*Charging* a fee isn't the correct word for this. But yes, the network's security will have to continue te be subsidized by fees.

Pruning nodes are nodes that leave out all transactions that have been fully spent.
The only thing pruning nodes maintain is an n-depth of full blocks, all block headers down to genesis and all transactions and their merkle branches which have unspent outputs. All the rest is discarded without compromising security in any way.
Such a node would take up maybe 600-700MB in disk space and be functional enough to have a fully workable system, although it cannot provide a full history.
Work is being done in the reference client to do this, but I'm not sure when we'll actually see these nodes in the wild:

I'm biased, so you should read/parse it yourself. But anyway:
Matt Corallo: Kicks off discussion, strongly against, in favor of fee market for long-term incentives (when lower block rewards become an issue). Meh about technical tradeoffs.
Tier Nolan: Miners can soft-fork to enforce lower block sizes than the 20MB (whatever it'll be) limit nodes/merchants/users agree upon; if they want a fee market, they'll get it regardless of what happens. Suggests this be done in a way it sort-of auto-corrects through miner consensus.
Mike Hearn: for, troubled because community is in such disagreement, suggests we need leadership, disagrees with fee economics being a problem
Peter Todd: against, because economics of fees and reduction in ability to participate fully (running a full node). Being rather sarcastic here and there (sorry).
Pieter Wuille: worried about state of current discussion, generally in favor of increased block size but cautious regarding hard fork (very good read)
Jorge Timon: doesn't believe we are pressed for time, in favor of awaiting what happens when blocks start filling up and the creation of a true fee market
Wladimir van der Laan: weakly against, everyone-verifies-everything doesn't scale well, even if it does work 20MB doesn't mean much. Cannot use assumptions like keeping up with moore's law. Higher limit = more cost to fully verifying. In favor of true fee market. For / con mitigation: breathing room for proper scaling solutions. 20MB doesn't mean it has to be 20MB. Fees aren't the only reason to drive off-chain innovation, tx speed is too - meaning: we don't necessarily need a fee market to allow off-chain innovation (lightning network) to happen. Size increase will work, disregarding unforeseen resolvable issues, but higher size means less 'be your own bank'. Politics suck. (very good read)

Merged mining encumbers the miner to set up a NMC node, which is basically incentivizing independent miners to join a pool that'll do that for them - further centralizing mining.

The private key when encoded into WIF is 296 or 304 bit (prepended 0x80 to indicate the bitcoin network, 4 byte checksum appended, optional 0x01 appended to indicate public key compression, encoded into BASE58 makes it 51 or 52 chars)
The public key is 65 byte (contains some padding, and may be [compressed]( to about half that size)
The public key hash is 160 bit (SHA256 hash + RIPEMD hash of the public key, which hashes to 160 bit)

Bear in mind segwit allows for a 75% fee discount on witnesses. This is quite an incentive to upgrade for major wallets, exchanges, brokers, etc.
Also, considering many merchants/businesses run on top of one or many nodes - their upgrading to segwit is most likely directly paired with upgrading those nodes; a fair deal of this ecosystem will immediately take advantage of segwit.
Thirdly, many other mechants that run off of APIs can upgrade without even knowing it, when an API upgrades for segwit. (Not going into insecurity and centralisation those APIs bring about for other reasons, but ah - reality is many people depend on these things)

Such an attack either fails, or destroys the network. If the former, which I think is the most likely outcome, then there is no problem. If the latter then nobody wins.
Further, if the there's consensus we want to keep the network from being destroyed by any means, we can implement measures such as not reorganizing up to a certain depth, or only accepting blocks with a certain % of all (proper fee) transactions in the pool, or whatever other horse tranquilizers we can think of.
In the end, the power lies with those who are in consensus, *not* the hashrate.

The easiest way to think about it is that a hard fork introduces new consensus rules that do not satisfy old rules. A soft fork does not introduce new rules, it makes existing ones more explicit.
For example, the speed limit on the highway is 120 km/h. This is like a network consensus rule that says:
    Speed on highway must be &lt;= 120 km/h
A hard fork would be to make the speed limit 150 km/h. It does not satisfy the old rule and clients that do not understand or know about the new rule will not allow for such speeds on 'their' highway.
A soft fork would be to make it 100 km/h. Old clients wouldn't care, the rule is still satisfied.

I think what you're getting at is that after I say "definitely not", you'll say "therefore they must represent economic consensus", which is a false cause fallacy.
Miners must *follow* economic consensus - because any hard fork they may instigate is immediately worthless if economic consensus is not aligned with theirs. They are *not* one and the same; miner consensus may not be used to measure economic consensus for this reason.

Search for 'pay-to-pubkey' transactions.
These pay coins directly to a public key rather than either a hash of a public key - pay-to-pubkey-hash / p2pkh, or a hash of a script - pay-to-script-hash / p2sh (current schemes).
They are insecure because they expose the public key directly on the blockchain before spending them, which leaves them vulnerable for arbitrary attackers to try and compute the private key out of them. (The cryptography is itself plenty secure, but not against quantum computing using Shor's algorithm)

I don't recall any of the core devs being in favor of specifically Gavin's proposal. Most had either technical, political or semantic objections to increasing to 20MB and nothing else. Even Gavin himself is still exploring the issue. There's hardly consensus the size limit should be changed at all if you're lumping all chatter on any medium together.
The core devs seem te be in majority agreement the limit should be increased, but that's hardly community consensus, and there isn't anything close to consensus on what, specifically, to do while increasing the limit; whether to have it adapt dynamically to changing conditions, increase periodically at a set rate, or something else.
And even if the core devs would be in consensus, it doesn't mean anything for whether the network as a whole is in agreement. It's supremely hard to predict or assert beforehand whether all or a strong majority of participants, users, merchants and miners agree with a hard fork of any kind.

Bitcoin is mostly 'advertised' as having near-zero cost, or negligible fees. Hardly ever do I hear people saying it's free. If they do, be sure to correct them double quick. Fees are an integral part of the bitcoin network.


This is not true. Miners ask for a higher fee if your transaction is larger in size, as measured in *bytes*. **Not** the amount you're transacting.

Visa, for further reference, is doing about 5000 transactions *per second*. If bitcoin were to match that at $0.01 per transaction, miners would receive $30 000 in fees every block. **Plus** the block reward.
That's at least 6 times more than they receive in (dollar valued) block rewards today.
It's also not unreasonable to think digital currencies allow for much more frictionless payments, leading to more transactions, which would far outweigh what Visa is doing today. Transaction costs below $0.01 are not out of the question given such adoption. It could be dirt-cheap for everyone participating. Rejoice all around. :)

The barrier to fully validate has nothing to do with any payment processors such as Coinbase.
The lightning network and similar isn't appealing because we're running into a block size limit, it's appealing because technologies like these will actually scale, and remove some of the sluggishness (confirmation times) and bloat (space and validation everyone must do) without compromising trust.
The blockchain does not scale to the lengths in which many people here seem to think it does. Inherent to the technology, it scales like O(n^2), which means the effort it takes to run explodes the further you try and push it, at some point it just grinds to a halt, so no, we need these limits until we implement a solution. If you thought we can scale to 1Gig blocks in any short to medium term, then I have bad news for you. We need a limit.
Is that limit the current 1MB? No, probably not. But can we remove it entirely? No, definitely not.

// Edit: To elaborate. What I feel the fed was looking for was a way to have a distributed ledger.

Miners are hashing 80 byte worth of block headers. 4 byte version, 32 byte prev block hash, 32 byte merkle root, 4 byte timestamp, 4 byte difficulty/'bits' and a 4 byte nonce.
The version, prevblock and bits headers are equal for all miners.
The timestamp is the same or very similar. (4 hour space, or 4 * 60 * 60 values, because a valid block is bounded to have a timestamp differing 2 hours from current time)
The nonce changes every hash and can be any value in the range. (4 bytes)
So far, these values could potentially be the same.
Then there's the merkle root. This value is a combined hash of all transactions in the block. While most transactions in a block could be the same, the coinbase transaction (the first transaction, which rewards the miner newly minted coins + transaction fees) is always different (because the destination for those coins differ for each miner)
Because the coinbase is different from any other miner, the merkle root will also be different.
So the header value which will always be different is the merkle root, while all other values are either equal, potentially equal, or similar.
Because a SHA256 hash is *completely* different from another SHA256 hash (roughly 50% of the output's bits will unpredictably flip) if even 1 bit in the input is different, miners will never get the same result, because 32 byte (well, about 16, in practice) worth of input is guaranteed to be different.

There is no reason for an unupgraded node to be taking advantage of such transactions (from their perspective, those transactions are non-standard and will not be mined by miners; and any such transaction would have precisely no meaning at all to you specifically)
In fact, your unupgraded node should not even understand *or acknowledge* such transactions as payment to *you*: *such a node has no idea what that transaction might be, or what rules it might adhere to*. So if that is true, then how could you possibly accept it?
For example, I might offer you a banana peel for no reason at all, and you would ignore me - and for good reason, because I must obviously be a mad man. What you don't know, however, is that where I come from, and from the perspective I have come to understand as fact, a banana peel is a token of great value that is to be cherished.
From my perspective, it would be merely your lack of knowledge of this fact - your unupgraded consensus ruleset, if you will - that makes you oblivious to this banana token of great value.
Upgrading your consensus ruleset permits you to learn about the awe-inspiring value of a banana peel, at which point you may - if you wish - take advantage of it - but before doing so, its significance to you is - and should be - nil. This is why soft-forks are safe (with some caveats ..).

If those txs have been tainted by a coinbase output, yep. Before long, the entire chain (well, the part that moves) is a direct descendant from a recent coinbase output.
In principle, an output that lived before the fork can be spent on both chains, and so long as it remains untainted and is included in both chains, will be valid in both. But coinbase taint would spread quadratically, much like the common flu; unless you explicitly shield your outputs from tainted outputs - they'll be contaminated and exclusive to a single chain very quickly.
@_date: 2015-01-19 14:57:59
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking aswell.
To make matters worse, if a sudden increase in price is 'warranted', meaning it's not a speculative bubble, but bitcoin is actually worth its price, then miners won't have much incentive to sell, which further decreases supply, and will further drive the price up up up.
While that may seem nice to holders, it's not exactly good news for coin distribution. Ideally, miners would sell out to the dollar as soon as they get the coins. At least for the next few halvings. But that's wishful thinking.

Presumably, yes. And presumably they will have risen long before that.
Miners need to be incentivised to do their work one way or another, and the incentives need to be sufficient for sound security of the network. If it isn't inflation that subsides this security, it'll have to be some other thing - fees are the mechanism already in place for doing this.

As for the size, it's 40 bytes primarily to facilitate storing up to 2 20 byte RIPEMD hashes or a 32 byte SHA256 hash. I believe it used to be 80, and it got changed back to 40 at the last second before the 0.9 release. To increase this is strongly disputed because whether there's a good reason for it is arguable; a hash should suffice, so 40 byte should suffice. To store something greater than that is regarded as no more than blockchain bloat

A hard fork introducing OP_EVAL or OP_EVALVERIFY or similar would've been consistent with the script language (although it has some other problems), and have required zero or little change in the architecture of a client implementation; just an additional implementation of an opcode.

Storing an event (transaction) in a ledger such that you can be confident it will remain there forever in exactly the state you published it is valuable, and - at present in PoW consensus algorithms - has a cost to those that put it there (miners which are performing 'work').
The cost / transaction fee (and currently also the block reward / block subsidy) exists to allow them to do this in a way it's secure.

Alright, so let's say that's a valid argument.
How is raising the block size limit not forcing node operators to move to a less-expensive (and, more notably, less secure) mode of using Bitcoin through schemes such as SPV? Not to mention the effects it has on forced network centralisation.

I should clarify:
My preference goes to increasing to 20MB (actually whatever) and then increasing at an x rate. Gavin's original proposal will do, except some value other than doubling annually which I now think may be too optimistic; explodes fast - I would like for research to be produced on this, although being the hypocrite that I am, I'm certainly not going to do it. This x value could have another factor thrown over it relating to timestamp, height, whatever. I literally don't care so long as we agree and it seems to be reasonable.
The reason I'd opt for a set rate is because I will then know exactly what to expect at any given time. I like that. ~~No uncertainties~~ One less uncertainty. *Regardless* of whether or not it turns out to be wrong or suboptimal.
Like 10 minutes for every block, done.
Halving every 210k blocks, done.
Diff readjustment every 2016 blocks, done.
All of those might be wrong or suboptimal, but I simply do not care; it's certain.
Karp's proposal doesn't fit into that. It's uncertain.
Then there's the actual 'attack': needlessly filling up blocks and putting resource pressure on nodes. This attack 'could' be mitigated by a block size limit (the whole reason a block size limit exists currently), where the limit is some value which nodes agree is reasonable to bear: you can't put resource pressure on nodes which are already committed to that potential pressure.
Karp's proposal is to have this limit set by previous experiences, experiences which might be *un*reasonable to bear to begin with, over which nodes have no control, and of which the only thing they do know is that it's increasingly *un*predictable in the future: not a solution.
Also, there's the argument (perpetuated especially over the dev mailing list) where there needs to exist a fee market in order to maintain long-term (post block reward) incentives. A market which can somehow only exist if there's a block size limit (in order to artificially create block space scarcity).
I'll give 'em that argument, even though I disagree this is a requirement, and refute by saying that if and when miners so desire (by deciding they are not properly funded), they can create this fee market invoked by an artificial block size limit through a soft fork. Miners can enforce a *lower* block size limit without nodes, merchants and users having anything to say about it. Hell, they've *sort of* been doing this *without soft fork* enforcement for years through the soft limit (not to be confused).
Finally, when there's a proposal to increase the block size limit I like (and the Karp one won't be one of them) and which seems to be getting a nice group of people who do too, I'll be upgrading my nodes. If miners don't like it, for whatever reason, they can soft fork to maintain it, in which case nothing happens and my upgrade has done nothing. 
All I know is, I won't be the problem when &gt;1MB blocks start hitting the network.
@_date: 2015-01-20 11:31:36
The minimum fee exists for that reason (even though strictly even the minimum fee is just good practice and nothing else), but the fee system itself exists to pay for the cost and effort of placing and securing transactions in the blockchain such that they cannot be reverted.

Absolutely, which is why I think in this case a 95% miner support (at flag day) is perfectly possible.


At this time, I can think of none, given that most of them have expressed they will follow whatever 'decision will be made' (within reason).
The 'nothing' scenario should ideally never happen, as everyone has a very strong incentive to agree. But, failing to get miner consensus over a change and not being able to arrive on the same page together, I see no reason to have any threshold at all - because, again, it only demonstrates miners have power over this.
I'll note though that the block size limit hard fork is trickier than you'd expect with the above policy, so, yeah.. (Trickier than, say, hard forking CT)

It's SPV.
But, bear in mind that even if you have the longest proof-of-work chain and it contains valid data (which you can't know except by trusting miners/the author of the trail), and you somehow know/assume it is valid, you will always have to sync - because you need the UTXO set; the database of all unspent transaction outputs, which is something an audit trail can't give you.
Also, you can't trustlessly participate in Factom if you aren't validating the Bitcoin Blockchain.
There's a lot of things Factom can do, but many more things it can't do. One thing it can't do is prove data is valid according to some frame - without having the data or the frame. It can certainly never be used to spin up a fully validating Bitcoin node, because the network itself is dependent on the valid (and correct) Bitcoin blockchain.

The adversarial case assumes that they are.
Look - I get the objection to RBF and I agree. This is why Opt-in RBF exists. It allows us to pretend the existing case is secure, while it demonstrably isn't, and pushes the ecosystem to move toward secure alternatives for their use case.
Reality is, most use cases are minimally affected. PoS merchants, shipping merchants, etc. none of this matters to them.
Those that are affected - instant payment for digital goods that are instantly exchanged: ShapeShift et. al - should move away from 0-conf. Not doing this is their choice, but complaining about it isn't gonna help their situation - 0-conf *simply* is not secure for their situation. They can mitigate it by using GreenAddress-like transactions only, or allowing 0-confs for known associates (ie. Coinbase wallets) only, or the limits you mentioned, but the fundamental problem of 0-confs is just that - fundamental.
It doesn't matter if it's RBF or First-Seen or whatever: it's insecure. Now, and forever. *They* should account for it - not the network, because the network can't.

Its main intended advantages, however, are that of better bandwidth spread, lower orphan rates, and lower latency. Not primarily faster confirmation - essentially, only the first confirmation can be within seconds, rather than minutes - every following confirmation is identical to the current situation.

Suppose there's a UTXO that has been unspent for 5 days and holds 2 bitcoins.
When its owner spends these coins, that'll make for 10 bitcoin-days-destroyed. You can arrive at that value by number_of_coins * days_not_moved. When you spend an output, the BDD for those 'coins' are reset to 0.
A high value of BDD, means many old coins moved, for example.
It's a simple metric that can't be gamed; you need to have a *lot* of coins sitting in storage doing nothing for a *long* time in order to 'destroy' a significant amount of bitcoin-days.

Everyone else .... who knows:
The big companies (with the exception of BitPay, and some relatively minor ones) are notoriously absent in all things Core development. If not for the good of the network, them funding at least some development in the Core software should be justifiable from a completely selfish point of view (ie. having a louder voice while making decisions, or knowing the project interior up close, seeing what the fish smell like and all that). But for some reason this isn't happening / they are reluctant in doing this.
As for users donating funds; that'd take a lot of users, and a lot of money, for relatively unimpressive results - funding just one full-time talented dev that does Core work for $100k/year would be an absolute steal, for example, and I doubt the community can (or wants to) scrap together even that amount, considering the reward is not readily apparent.

It typically is, but they are free to decide in which way it is automated, or implement their own composition algorithm/policy.


Unfortunately, everyday hardware (such as a PC) does not make a dent in the vast mining power of today, which is exclusively run on ASICs that far outperform conventional machines.


Well. Let's say miners would only select the lowest-paying transaction and put those in a block. The logical result would be that nobody would pay any fee. It'd make for even more transaction, which would result in more clogging.
It makes sense for miners to give the highest-paying transactions the highest priority for inclusion in the next block. Not only for profits, but also for the network at large - this is how the network is intended to function.


They are a business, and it'd be a safe bet that they all do - either short- or long term or both.

Simply taint your coins by mixing them with post-fork coinbase coins and they'll be invalid on the old chain. Same story the other way around.

Processing transactions is actually a rather trivial task, it doesn't take a whole lot of time to do this. It's a fraction of the computing power miners perform.
What the miners are really doing is 'work', which is defined as a somewhat simple hashing algorithm used for lots and lots of cryptographic applications; SHA256. It's not a "complicated puzzle" or some magic moon math as some introductory videos or descriptions claim. It's simple.
They hash 80 bytes of block headers over and over and over and over again, changing a little bit in the headers each time, which makes the resulting hash completely different and unpredictable. If the resulting hash satisfies some conditions set by the network (whether the hash is 'lower' than a predefined target value), then the block is considered valid by the network, at which point it will be accepted as the 'next' block in the chain.
The network aims for this task to take 10 minutes on average, which is why it keeps getting more difficult to perform. So long as it's profitable to keep doing this (ie. you can pay for the cost of doing this with the rewards you receive in bitcoin), then people will continue to do this. If they don't, then the difficulty will drop, making the task easier, reducing the cost to perform it. The system balances itself.
The 'work' that miners do, makes the network more secure. The miners provide network security. The more work they do, the harder it is for any one party to erase the transaction history. At this point, it's considered to be a near-impossible task which will not go unnoticed.
Currently, the block reward of 25BTC is incentivizing miners to do this task. This reward halves every 4 years, which means the last bitcoin will be mined somewhere around the year 2140. In addition to that, miners are also given the aggregate of fees on the transactions they have included in the block they are mining; as the block reward approaches zero, these fees will keep the mining incentives high enough for the network to remain secure.
Even when the last bitcoin has been mined, the fees could continue to incentivize miners to keep on mining profitably.

This was a well presented video.
Strong flavor of advertisement inside it, but ah.
That said, regarding the criticisms bit. Run a node with -blocksonly and any participant can already bring their bandwidth use down to the absolute minimum, which is smaller than any other proposal possibly can be.
The barrier to scaling isn't so much bandwidth (or storage, or cpu) anymore (though the quadratic network-wide gossip throughput should always be considered), but latency.
Thinblocks do nothing for latency, they possibly only add to it because they require up to 2 additional RTTs. IBLTs and weak blocks live in a single packet; they can possibly boost latency for regular peers.
If bandwidth is of concern, then that is already solved: -blocksonly
And for miners, for whom low latency in block propagation is paramount, they can take advantage of the fast relay network. It doesn't sound ideal because it is centralised, but they'll centralise this part themselves anyway because that is simply that much more efficient. You can't hope to replace the fast relay network, only improve it by decentralising its operation.

I don't think any of that reasoning is relevant to the motivation of running a node.
The nitty gritty reason to run a node is: to make sure your coin is actually your coin, part of a money.

I run 3 out of my 4 nodes on 3 different VPSs, and my experience with 2 of those nodes has been terrible.
One of them periodically kills the bitcoind process. I've contacted them multiple times to ask for the reason they're doing this - and how, and if they even know about it. They deny it, and refuse to look into it. Renaming the process to something else 'magically' solves the problem. I've stopped using/trusting that node as a result and will not extend the contract with that company.
Another was put offline because it made 'too many connections', without notice, before or afterward. Only after contacting them and having to 'promise' I would limit the connection, would they spin it up again. Wtf. They've also purged various packages only multiple occasions, without notice. Same story with this node - stopped trusting it / doing anything sensitive.
The third has been running admirably, but not under my physical control.
The fourth is under my full, isolated and physical control - and although it has somewhat equivalent performance as  I am most comfortable using this - for obvious reasons.
VPS hosts can do nasty shit you will never know about - being ignorant of that fact doesn't help anyone.

Piling work on top of an unvalidated tip of the chain decreases security. 'Work' is what is securing this network's past state, and it's only useful if it's piled on top of the correct chain - which you can only be sure of if it is validated.

Seeing that XT behaves differently from existing consensus than nodes that precisely maintain existing consensus do given certain conditions, it is considered an altcoin. There is nothing wrong with that logic, it makes perfect sense in fact.

Here's another attempt at explaining it without all the tech stuff.
**Problem:** We need to figure out if Alice is the owner of a key to a specific lock we all know about, but without requiring Alice to show us her key.
**Given:** The lock and the key have been enchanted by Harry Potter, the key can be used to turn a stone into a donkey, and the lock may be used to turn the donkey into a stone.
**Answer:** Alice takes a stone, shows it to everyone, and turns the stone into a donkey, she then gives the donkey to everyone.
Those wishing to verify ownership take the lock and the donkey, they turn the donkey into the stone, and check if the stone Alice showed them is the same they turned the donkey into. If it is, then Alice must be the owner of the key that can turn stones into donkeys.
If the donkey is turned into, say, a car tire instead of a stone, then Alice is not the owner of the key (or she has used the wrong key).
- Stone - arbitrary data (// Edit: the actual data would be a number of values of the transaction you're signing)
- Donkey - signed arbitrary data
- Car tire - Data that does not equal the data represented by the Stone
- Lock - public key
- Key - private key
- Alice - Alice
- Everyone - The bitcoin network (miners, nodes and users)
- Harry Potter - Asymmetric Cryptography

This is already in place natively, sort of, and it is called SPV; every block points back to the previous block all the way to genesis, providing a proof-of-work chain.
These proofs of work indicate miners have committed a whole lot of resources to what might now be the present valid state of the blockchain, but it doesn't necessarily mean that that which is committed to is actually valid, just that a bunch of work has been done from which one might presume it is.
To actually determine what is the correct and valid chain, you also need to check all of its contents for validity. And, unfortunately, this seems to be an inescapable requirement in order to objectively and with certainty determine the blockchain you're looking at is the correct one.

It allows for 20 times the amount of transactions in a block.
Currently the network cannot handle more than a sustained rate of roughly 3-4 transactions per second, because the block size limit of 1 MB (and some other things) limits any blocks from becoming too large. This rule was initially implemented to reduce spam, prevent disincentivized mining of large blocks (because propagation takes longer), and to prevent the network from being DDOS'd. It was originally intended to be removed when the aforementioned problems were solved.
Back when it was first implemented, the average block size was nowhere near the limit, but in recent months we've been creeping toward the limit and this rule of which the intention was for it to be temporary, now needs to be removed through a hard fork.
Concretely, there is no way bitcoin can scale to a global payment/settlement network so long as this rule exists. Even using horse tranquilizers in terms of scaling such as the lightning network is it simply not possible with an upper limit of just 1 MB, so we need to get rid of it.
The issue now, is that doing this requires a hard fork for which there really is no 'best' way of doing it; the issue is mostly political - there's a lot of different opinions on the subject, all or most of them are equally valid, yet contradictory. It's a very complicated issue to achieve consensus over, yet consensus over what to do here is exactly what we need.
So, Gavin's suggestion (so far) is to increase the block limit to 20MB somewhere mid '16, and then double that limit (roughly) annually. That'll work. But so will increasing it to 5, then doubling, or 40, then doubling, or 10, and tripling, or taking the next value in the fibonacci sequence every year, or removing any limit altogether. It really doesn't matter, yet it's very important - so it does matter, and we need to agree on what to do.

It should be noted that whatever feature a soft fork brings, it is irrelevant/null/void from your perspective/viewframe until you upgrade.
As such, no soft fork can *force* you to accept 21M+ tokens, and no soft fork can *force* you to accept 1MB+ blocks.

But that is precisely what segwit allows us do! :)
The software doesn't explicitly flag the updated segwit transactions it has no understanding of as 'suspect' (it perceives them as valid without question), but segwit *does* allow them to be distinguished from anything else. This is why you can interpret a worthless banana peel as a worthless banana peel; all versions of segwit transactions you have no knowledge of are worthless banana peels.
And while version bits, not the observation of worthless banana peels, is the indication for nodes to upgrade; segwit does make any soft fork much safer than was true earlier (and also easier).


An attacker's chain? When you are on another/the wrong chain you are *always* vulnerable to attack - regardless of soft forks or hard forks or banana peels.


Well, why? You would first have to accept updated SW transactions for you to perceive their spending as valid, would you not? - and remember, from your perspective you have no understanding of these transactions, so how can you? And existing SW transactions that are *not* adhering to the consensus ruleset *you* are aware of are still invalid from your frame.

Well there's the misunderstanding; no, this is not the shared ledger. This 'longer' chain does not exist to all users who haven't upgraded. They might see this chain wooshing by, validate it, determine it is invalid, and proceed to discard it and ban the peer who relayed it. Only the longest/best chain *that is valid under a given set of globally agreed upon consensus rules*, is the one and only chain.
The shorter valid chain that does not have a 2MB block inside it is the shared ledger, from the perspective of those who haven't upgraded.
*That*'s what it means that miners *cannot* define or change rules; sure, they can create an arbitrary amount of blocks adhering to an arbitrarily different consensus ruleset - they can create blocks that inflate the coin supply, they can double spend, they can spend coins without proving they are allowed to, they can do all of these things... And none of it matters; users will reject these blocks, they will not exist in the best/longest chain they follow, and, for them, life will go on as usual, while the miner who did all this work to create an invalid block just wasted it on a useless piece of data.

Whether it reduces bitcoin's value I dare not speculate on, but you're right that this use-case in the way it is implemented today gets eliminated. Bear in mind it was never a use-case that was advertised to function - Bitcoin achieves consensus over time, not in an instant.
It's a strong indication there is desire for the instant-payment use-case, however. Which is why secure alternative instant payment schemes such as Lightning should be sought after, rather than 0-conf.

By expressing an absolute quantity, weight, in kilograms, which we've defined to be equal to a measure of weight in a vault in Paris which, as it turns out, is permeable over time, we have not expressed weight absolutely, we've expressed it relative to some thing which can change.

A hard fork can be considered more of a hackjob:
And it wouldn't maintain full interoperability, because a hard fork necessarily expels any participant that does not upgrade.
Seeing that the BIP is still a draft, I'm not sure how exactly a wallet may indicate to a sender it wishes to receive a segwit payment or a current payment, but I would expect this to be possible (ie. Address version or something - this isn't explicitly mentioned/explained that I could find).
Either way, a non-upgraded/current wallet can already spend *to* a segwit-accepting wallet by taking advantage of P2SH, where you just pay to a script, which just happens to be a segwit script.

You know, a democratic node implementation where users vote on which policies to enable/default/add is a not-that-terrible idea.
People could motion its developers to set/implement RBF, or FSP, or opt-in RBF by default or something. Add an index, direct features in the wallet, things like that. Great! (Anyone is already able to do this simply by forking the project and adding a feature/preference themselves, but considering the hordes of users that aren't capable of doing this themselves, they could exert some power into making it happen this way - why not)
But changing consensus critical properties in the way purported to happen in Classic, while such properties are not something sensitive to democratic whim, is the wrong way to go about this - when beyond pondering viability and discussion.

Pre-fork*, but yes.


Yeah, and also - anyone may broadcast the transaction from one chain to the other. So even if you spend it on one chain, anyone at all may take that transaction and broadcast it on the other chain (it doesn't change the meaning of the transaction, but a valid transaction is a valid transaction - so long as the outputs exist on both)


That transaction will be valid on one chain, and not the other - one of the inputs does not (and cannot) exist on one of the chains, so it's invalid there.


ChainB doesn't check (or know about) ChainA.
Say you have a 5 BTC output (outOld) on OldChain (valid on both new chains), and a 5 BTC tainted output (outA) on ChainA. You can create a transaction (txA) that consumes both of those outputs (outOld, outA) into 10 BTC on ChainA.
You now have 10 BTC on ChainA, and 5 BTC on ChainB. The 5 BTC on ChainB is the same output that you spent in txA - but this transaction is invalid on ChainB, so the previous output (outOld) remains unspent there.

The GreenAddress-type transaction scheme is not a payment channel. It is an ordinary multisig P2SH transaction. They can guarantee instant payment because the cosigner (typically a wallet) can prove they cosigned a transaction, and tell whomever is the receiver of that transaction they will not sign those inputs again. It's loosely trust-based.
It's excellent, adds 0 complexity to existing p2p/payment infrastructure, adds no network on top, and only requires vendors/merchants to check with the cosigner.
But Lightning will be magnitudes better / faster / smoother / more private / etc.

Employing and assuming the expectations set forth by RBF, is similar to 'defensive' driving - employing all safe driving practices available to you. Whereas assuming FSP, is similar to aggressive and irresponsible driving.
The one downside to RBF currently, is that some roads (use cases of payment, namely those that desire instant payment for instant exchange) make for a very cumbersome driving experience, while there are no safe and easy alternative driving practices available yet. Beyond this, there are no objections to RBF.

The 'reasonable assumptions' we're making pertain to this school of thought: 
Guess what, RBF is the policy that is most economically rational for miners to run.
It doesn't take an adversarial/rogue miner to run RBF, it takes a rational one. The reasonable assumption you're suggesting is "run RBF and we'll sell this shitcoin" - and that notion might unfortunately be part of the reason they aren't running RBF today yet. But, in this and various other cases, that isn't the notion that the concept of mining is built around, if it were then the foundations of this system would start breaking down right quick: 
all it takes for First-Seen to be utterly shot to pieces is a *very* small fraction of mining to run RBF (*not even that* - even with the entire network running First-Seen, you could still double-spend by simply playing the odds of success), which would allegedly trigger this "we'll sell this shitcoin" threshold. It is therefore rational for the Bitcoin economy at large, both in the short aswell as the long term, *to run RBF* - why? Tragedy of the commons.
A solution to tragedy of the commons? Centralisation. Therefore: Nope nope nope, eat the bullet and run RBF - and find another solution to the use case First-Seen is supposed to allow for (and fail at): Waiting for confirmation, GreenAddress-type transactions, Lightning or choosing to be at risk.

It'll work so long as you both use MyCelium (or something explicitly compatible).
But it's a little yucky, from both a security and UX perspective.
For security; it only takes 1 out of 2 compromised devices to steal everything. Not great.
Spending at the same time might present some 'interesting' scenario's. Bear in mind that you might inadvertently attempt a double spend against a merchant here.
For UX at the moment, labels won't be shared, for example. Not that big a deal.
Later, when wallets start becoming smarter, and start grouping together unspent outputs to better preserve privacy, those groupings might get distorted across different devices - which is bad for privacy (not terrible - it'll be just as bad as it is today, which might be ok).
Or who knows what weird edge cases might pop up when wallets start using information known only locally more extensively. It's highly unlikely you'll lose any money over it, but it's something to bear in mind.

Depends on how the attacker has framed its attack. For example if the hashing power was previously mining genuinely, and is suddenly brought offline to mine a covert chain, then all of the sudden ~51% of the hashrate will appear to have disappeared, which might indicate an attack is ongoing.
However if the attacking entity has managed to accrue 51% of the hashrate without anyone knowing the hashrate even exists in the first place, then they could trivially make it so that nobody would know an attack is underway.

I could create a transaction handing myself 1000 BTC out of a non-existent transaction output right now. When I broadcast that transaction to the network it will quickly be rejected and not propagate, because the output I am referencing as an input to my bogus transaction does not exist.
If a miner, for whatever reason, tries to mine my bogus transaction, and computes a seemingly valid block containing it, that entire block will be invalid, because that bogus transaction is in there.
When this invalid block containing the invalid transaction is broadcasted to the network, not a single node and not a single miner would accept it.

It _can't_ be the longest chain because it is _invalid_, which all users that run nodes would immediately detect, causing them to discard the chain and ban the miners from their connections.
Where you are wrong is in thinking that miners are in any way relevant in the creation of consensus. Users, the economy, creates consensus, by validating the blocks that miners create for a certain ruleset. If the blocks violate those rules, then that chain does not exist to those users.
Again, it is paramount for a successful UASF for users to widely agree on the new ruleset, only then is a 'longer' chain that is invalid under the new rules effectively discarded.

They signal an EB and ED value in their coinbase transaction.
Take this recent block by bitcoin.com:
Their input script (scriptSig) for the coinbase transaction of that block reads, when interpreted in ASCII:
    /pool.bitcoin.com/ /EB1/AD6/
The important part is:
    /EB1/AD6/
Which BU nodes interpret as the EB (excessive block, 1) and AD (acceptance depth, 6) values, and which the chart thing uses to distinguish BU blocks from normal blocks.
Historically, pools and miners have always used the coinbase transaction input script to put in arbitrary and less arbitrary data.
The coinbase transaction for the genesis block contains the famous Times headline, for example.
    The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks
See 
And it regularly contains personal messages, including marriage proposals:
    /HaoBTC/Sun Chun Yu: Zhuang Yuan, will you marry me?/
Also, BIP34 is a consensus layer specification that uses the same value space to make each coinbase transaction unique, by plugging the block height in the first few bytes.
The coinbase input script is like the free-reign version of OP_RETURN outputs, though they are a bit more special because they are deterministically linked to whatever entity produced the Proof-of-Work, which makes it possible to put in values like AD and EB and have those values speak for the miner, anonymously.

TL;DR: The main reasoning behind RBF is that it does not introduce a situation where merchants come to rely on a weakened set of security assumptions, whereas the alternative (First-Seen-Policy) does.
**Long post with much history and many simple words ahead:**
Transactions that have not yet been confirmed, these 0-conf transactions, are fundamentally unsafe to accept as payment. It doesn't matter which mempool policy the network at large is running - transactions that are not yet included in the blockchain are *fundamentally* in a state of uncertainty.
Mining exists to get rid of this uncertainty; by mining we're committing a ton of 'work' on top of a globally agreed-upon 'state' of a set of transactions. This set of transactions with work on top is the blockchain. The more work on top of a transaction, the more secure it is to accept that transaction as payment, because it will become increasingly expensive to revert that transaction (and everything that follows - producing 'work' is expensive).
At the deepest level, this is what Bitcoin is. It converts a set of 'events' (transactions) whose existence is *uncertain*, into a globally agreed-upon *certain* state over time. This globally agreed-upon state is what's referred to as the ledger. Given there is *time* involved here, it follows that instant certainty, or confirmation, into this global ledger, is impossible. Instant payment on the Bitcoin network is impossible.
Now, unfortunately, instant payment is something users of this network (today) strongly desire. So, a long time ago, it was decided that to offer this - instant payment, nodes would accept and relay *only* the *first* transaction they would come across. This made some kind of sense, right? If the network would only add the first transaction of one type (set of UTXOs) into the pool of uncertainty, then surely only that uncertain transaction would be the one that got the confirmation. It added more certainty to something that is fundamentally uncertain. It seemed to make sense, and it worked! Solved, right?
Well not really. The certainty this policy offered us was only a perceived one - there cannot be a policy that can add certainty to something which is *fundamentally* uncertain. As a result, it kind of worked, but it was always known this scheme could be gamed - it was broken, it can be abused. But it worked well enough for the time being, so people just let it be. (back then, people were mostly waiting for confirmations anyway, and as you say, abusing it was hard - so nobody was really affected)
Then people started creating businesses that took advantage of 0-confirmation payments using this unsafe policy. Coinbase, BitPay, ShapeShift, a LOT of payment processors, even some exchanges and brokers. At first this seemed great - these were rock solid businesses and the usability their payment scheme offer is great. But.... everyone seemed to be forgetting they all operated on top of a set of fundamentally insecure security assumptions. And they really are insecure. Not only can their flaws be easily explained and proven - people are demonstrating 0-conf payment accepting vendors can be tricked into accepting transactions that are later double-spent. This first-seen policy is now a huge security hole that can cause merchants to lose money.
RBF is the solution here. *It is completely aligned with Bitcoin's security assumptions - it does not degrade them in any way.* On top of that, RBF has some pretty significant advantages over FSP that make the network more efficient. I'm personally not all that interested in these (not yet, that is - mainly because we do not yet take advantage of them), and getting rid of 0-conf payments is reason enough to move to it.
Unfortunately - adopting RBF as originally proposed also means we must abandon 0-confirmation payments as we know them. Instant payments - the thing businesses were built around. So, every time the topic comes up, users and merchants at large don't like this approach - they perceive it could hurt their business and great usability. And they're right, but not in the way they think they're right: their businesses rely - in part - on weak security assumptions that exist within this network, by our own doing. Instead of 'fixing' these weak security conditions *(which is impossible - as explained above)*, RBF proposes they be removed entirely. So it's understandable that's upsetting.
From a security engineering perspective - these weak security assumptions must be dealt with regardless. RBF does this, and the price to doing it is killing 0-conf as we know it. Simple as that.
So now Opt-in RBF is a thing. It allows users to explicitly signify they will allow (even though they technically have no choice in allowing this) their transaction to be (or not be) replaced in nodes/miners that have adopted this 'Opt-in RBF' policy. It gives users, merchants, businesses, etc. some shred of choice - it allows them to cling to the existing First-Seen policy while the network at large moves on.
What makes all this exceptionally unfortunate, it that the only alternatives to 0-conf instant payments have not yet been implemented or adopted. Things like the Lightning Network will take many more months before it is available. If they were available today, then immediately rolling out RBF would be a more justifiable action. The Opt-in variant of RBF is a stop-gap solution until such time.
TL;DR2 - RBF is something we must move to primarily from a security perspective. Instant-payment alternatives can be provided another way, such as Lightning - but it is not yet available. Until it is, Opt-in RBF is what Core is going with.

I'll clarify this position:
To old nodes, there would be no hard fork if miners were to include an invalid spend of a segwit transaction in a post-UASF chain, because such a spend is valid under the old rules (though I'll note it's non-standard).
To UASF nodes, there would be an invalid chain appearing.
In neither case there is a hard fork, but there would be a split. I did say the difference is slight but crucial.

This is hard to predict.
First, see this list on wallets that have indicated support:
You'll note the majority of widely used SPV wallets have. Wallets include GreenAddress, Mycelium, Bread Wallet, BitGo (many exchanges), Multibit, BitcoinJ (which many wallets use/depend on under the hood) and Trezor. It's quite an impressive list.
All of these wallets will be able to take full advantage of segwit script programs when it is deployed.
All wallets that do not upgrade will be able to take advantage of a hybrid-model of segwit when sending money to wallets that do support segwit, by sending to a segwit-style P2SH (3) address. While the advantage here is not optimal, it is there. It will help during the transition to full cross-compatibility.
Considering many large exchanges use wallets that have already indicated support, and are responsible for a large portion of transactions - they will support segwit immediately after deployment (ie. Bitfinix, Bitstamp, Kraken)
However, some companies that process many payments are notoriously missing on the above list. Notably, brokers such as Coinbase and Circle, and processors such as BitPay. Whether they have segwit in place on deployment is, as yet, an unknown.
All-in-all, consider that all participants in this system have a significant incentive to move toward segwit-style transactions, as a large portion of their transactions would be discounted in block space, resulting in a smaller fee. Especially the above brokers/processors or exchanges that do many payouts would see a notable difference in total transaction fee costs.
For reference, widespread P2SH rollout has taken approximately 2 years. P2SH was a *much* more complicated upgrade, and required wallets to, essentially, be written from scratch to support its use cases (ie. multisig). When P2SH was deployed, there were basically no wallets that indicated they would be taking advantage of it in any reasonable timeframe.
What we're seeing with segwit is in complete contrast of the P2SH situation, even before deployment. There is widespread support in wallets and services. And this makes sense; the upgrade is fairly minimal in comparison, the benefit is instant and remarkable, and requires no change in thinking or business model. We're in a much better position with segwit *now*, than we were with P2SH *a year after* its deployment.

Well that's the great thing, that doesn't matter.
If your payment-accepting security model is aligned with RBF, then there is no alternative globally or locally adopted node policy scheme (such as first-seen, or anything) that can cause you to lose money as a result of that. RBF doesn't degrade to the security model provided by Bitcoin proper. The one thing that might not always work, is the features offered by RBF - such as feebumping - and that isn't catastrophic at all: you can't lose money that way.

Right. If it's 2-6% of miners disagreeing for reasons that are not convincing to the economic supermajority (of which we unfortunately have no metric), and they're blocking activation as a result, then the economic supermajority should opt to drop the mining threshold entirely, not lower it. It would otherwise be a demonstration of miners having power in the making of decisions like these, while reality is they do not.
This threshold exists to better ensure a smooth mining crossover. To do that, some close-to-total mining consent should be sought - similar to the soft fork thresholds. The threshold does not exist to measure the degree to which this economy consents - it is the wrong metric for this measurement. In other words; fully consenting miners or wing it.

Well no. Proving data is valid by providing an audit trail is not their business model. Their business model is to *record the occurrence of some claim* in a way it can be trusted (by committing a proof of these claims in the blockchain).
The actual claim is open for interpretation to the user; they would still have to verify whether the claim holds any ground - but they can be sure the claim was made by some given entity at some given time.
For example, you could claim you have ownership over the deed to a house by committing this claim to the Factom network, and show, to anyone, at a later time, that you have made this claim when you did. The Factom network can *prove* to anyone that you, indeed, have made a claim.
Whether the claim is valid (whether it's a valid deed to a house) remains to be determined by investigating the actual claim. And this is not something the Factom network can (or should) provide.

The 6 hour figure is arbitrary (and probably outdated)
But longer is generally better.
- it takes some time to catch up - depending on your machine and version of the software.
- being connected to the network for longer means you will be connected to the network more broadly; your node continually and unpredictively connects to many nodes that the network 'gossips' around. It takes some time to be connected to as wide a variety of peers Core can come up with. This improves on privacy greatly.
- a node that's active for only, say, half an hour a day doesn't "give as much back" as an average node would. It's a minor reason, but the network couldn't function if *all* nodes were only available for 30 minutes a day.

It doesn't directly, but segwit allows easy upgrading of Script ruleset versions, so rolling out the necessary opcodes is now a breeze.
The two-way-peg requires a new opcode or 2 (the one that locks funds into a peg, and the one which accepts an SPV proof that can unlock funds after a contest period), and adding/rolling out these opcodes requires only a new segwit version with some new Script behavior. Current/old clients will 'assume' all transactions with this new segwit version can be spent (regardless of its witnesses), while upgraded clients know what to do with it.
(note: old clients still and will always check for the most important consensus rules even under this somewhat degraded validation model - such as the 21M limit and chain of ownership according to the rules they know of - their security is *not* completely compromised and their operating is *not* completely obsolete. All soft forks work like this, so nothing's really different, only made easier)
Interestingly (and this is just a hunch that just came to mind), if the sidechain has adopted segwit, then the SPV proofs that unlock funds on the main chain can be made stronger because segwit makes fraud proofs for *all* consensus rules possible.

An upgrade resulting from an intended soft fork rollout can be done by anyone on their own terms and volition. While it'd be wise to upgrade, it isn't forced by any means.
Claiming the security given by node operation degrades to *zero* is a bit of an overstatement; you're still validating the state of consensus you're aware of, ie. the 21M limit, chain of ownership, and your perception of the scripting system, for example, though it's certainly true that security has degraded a fair deal.
If one hard fork is such a big deal, then I see no reason to double the problem.

A blockchain is merely a cryptographic construct wherein state may be recorded in such away that it builds on top of previous state. Not only is it incorruptible because many independent participants continually audit its integrity, anyone may, at any time; audit its *past* integrity aswell. What Bitcoin has done to this construct, is add PoW, which allows you to do the latter safely and without central control, or trust.
For example, I could participate today, verify the full blockchain, and make completely and objectively certain to myself that its contents all the way to the genesis block in '09 are correct - I don't *need* the assumptions that all involved parties have always verified everything in the past - when I was not around: I can verify the past myself, today.

The biggest scalability strain for bitcoin is not bandwidth, it's latency. The impossibility of creating a zero-latency distributed system is the whole entire reason the blockchain exists as it does.

Put simply, the way ownership is transferred over the blockchain is by providing challenges (in transaction outputs) and proofs (in transaction inputs) in a simple specialized language called 'Bitcoin Script'.
Miners and nodes verify this script, if the result is true, the transaction is valid, and miners can include it in a block.
Satoshi added a myriad of operations in this scripting language, not all of which are enabled or used today. Using only a very small subset of these script operations it's possible to transfer value from A to B, for example, but loads more are possible. Supposedly he designed this language 'years before bitcoin', with smart contracts and such in mind.

Using miner consensus as a measure for economic consensus is wrong. The reason we are taking advantage of this one objective metric we have is to ensure a smooth mining crossover - mining on the 'old' chain should ideally discontinue the moment the switch occurs, as such, we should strive for as close to 100% miner agreement possible; 95-100%. We are *not* using this metric to measure consensus over making a change; miners could 'vote' to increase the block reward all they want, for example, and it would mean precisely nothing.
If miners don't agree with the 'rough consensus' the economic majority has already settled upon, and they cannot convince this economic majority of a reason as to why, then (failing any effort to convince them) this activation threshold should be abandoned entirely - and use a flag day instead. It would make for a rough crossover, but tough shit. Miners haven't any more say in making decisions on changes to the protocol as any other participant does, so using the 'miner vote' metric as a dependent on making changes doesn't make any sense.

Whatever happens, deploying both at the same time and either dependent on the other is very messy for many reasons, though it might seem intuitive.
This being a consensus system, you could agree with one upgrade (such as SW) but not the other (the hard fork limit bump). Rolling out both at the same time would force those people to disagree with both, for example.

That is completely different. Brute forcing private keys is computationally unfeasible even from a theoretical perspective whereas double spending a 0-conf is feasible from both a theoretical aswell as a practical perspective.


It aligns with the system in that it does not introduce a weak security model that business may come to rely upon. It is better at least in that respect.
It does break current use cases - those use cases are a result of the current first-seen status-quo and the false perception that it is secure. This observation makes it clear there is a strong desire for the instant-payment use case, however, it does not mean the current approach to implementing it is ideal.

I would say this should be deployed on top of and separate from segwit.
As far as short-term scaling goes, segwit alone already gets us there in my opinion. The Core roadmap is totally agreeable with me.
However, longer term, there's gonna be a fleshed out flexcap proposal or something similar, and when we deploy that we, basically, have no idea what will happen.
Doing a shorter-term (a year from now, let's say) 'nonsense' hard fork such as BIP 102, primarily to collect data on what happens in practice, might just solve that.
The first moon missions weren't manned for the same reason, for example; I'm not looking forward to deploying the real deal, and be caught with my pants down.

A hard fork is the condition where a rule that is backward incompatible is first seen in a block, causing nodes to observe this new backward incompatible ruleset to fork off via hard fork, and old nodes to remain with the unforked chain with whatever portion of the hashing power.
The condition you describe is the violation of a backward _compatible_ soft forked rule, which is slightly but crucially different, in that miners will explicitly be violating rules the wider network observes, similar to the condition where miners ignore a rule such as the block reward halving.
This is why a UASF requires exceedingly widespread adoption well in advance of actual activation among the userbase enforcing the rules. Without it, miners might well get away with theft, similar to the condition where an insignificant portion of the economy observes the rules today.

Yes I'm aware.


Bear in mind there is little distinction to be made between some internet-connected machine with the ability to mandate an offline air-locked machine to sign (through some means) a message, with an internet-connected machine that holds private keys.
A cold wallet is not a cold wallet if it can be accessed by an automated system (such as an exchange's withdrawal mechanics).
When I say cold wallet here, I mean it can be accessed by humans, and humans only. That is, no exchange payout mechanics.


I didn't make that implication. I implied a proper exchange would multisig their cold wallet funds.
Okay. Let's rewind to the (theorised) situation where some exchange is doing simple withdrawals using a (hot) wallet that's handling 1 UTXO of 10k BTC initially. Every time some user is withdrawing some (let's say 10) of his coins, the exchange will spend that UTXO into
    10 BTC -&gt; user a
    9.99k BTC -&gt; change/exchange
next guy, withdrawing 30 BTC
    30 BTC -&gt; user b
    9.96k BTC -&gt; change/exchange
And so on.
That right there is just about the worst practice you can employ. It's advertising to everyone doing a withdrawal that there is a hugely disproportionate amount of coin in a single one of an exchange's hot wallet. Zero attempts have been made here to even obfuscate the coin distribution or the method by which an exchange is handling withdrawals; an attacker knows exactly who to attack, and how much he will stand to gain should he succeed in his efforts of compromising that hot wallet.
Stories of an exchange's hot wallet being swept have existed since there have been exchanges - the track record of their hot wallets does not look pretty. [Bitstamp's ~17k hot wallet theft]( being a notable recent one. The above practice of handling payouts certainly doesn't help their efforts of securing it.

Your understanding of how transactions work is more or less correct. Here's a visual aid sorta transaction explorer which might help:
One clarification: A transaction input is no more than a pointer to an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO): "an input spends an output"


That is completely up to the wallet. All of the above options are possible.
The protocol has nothing to do with transaction composition.


There are no (relevant) requirements or restrictions on the input/output composition of a transaction from a protocol perspective (other than the requirement of being a valid transaction). But there are some important other considerations for wallets to make while selecting inputs to reach a given amount.
Privacy. Spending multiple outputs in the same transaction links them together, indicating they (likely) belong to the same owner. They leak information about past and present ownership of coins. Linking outputs that haven't yet been linked should be avoided when at all possible (though many wallets don't).
Capacity. Spending many outputs decreases the UTXO load imposed on all nodes in the network (a bit). From a capacity point of view - it is most desirable to spend the highest amount of UTXOs in a single transactin.
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:00:13


Fair enough - GreenAddress-type transaction go through BIP70, which makes 2 round trips (I think?), a (possibly blind) broadcast, verifying the broadcast, and a green-address-instant-payment-verification round-trip. It's pretty fast and instant-ish.
LN transactions take some yet-to-be-converged-upon number of round trips. Anywhere between 4-20 or so (ballpark). They're both fast to be sure - will depend on external factors.
LN can be more private, though. In GreenAddress the cosigner will know you, and the cosigner is trusted, whereas in Lightning it's possible for nobody to know anyone.




There's a difference between GreenAddress the wallet, and GreenAddress-type transactions. They've both been 'invented/created' by the same guy, but the transaction-type can be universal and is more like an extension on top of 70.
GreenAddress-the-wallet makes certain that the money you allow to be cosigned by them remains yours, by sending you a signed timelocked transaction after every UTXO you create. This transaction becomes valid after some configurable amount of time, after which only your signature is needed to spend it.
This scheme can now be improved with OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, but I'm not sure if they've implemented that yet.
In other words, even if they go rogue, or they vanish, or they are attacked, then you can access your funds after the designated amount of time.

You will be able to receive payments run through historic segwit outputs perfectly fine; your node considers such outputs valid (albeit nonstandard, but valid nonetheless) today. It is equivalent to the P2SH/BIP16 rollout.

Because if mined, the economy deems the chain wherein that blocks resides invalid, and will discard it as if it never existed, making the coins worthless. Again, that is assuming widespread adoption among users, which is prerequisite for such an activation mechanism.

That's fair enough, but given that the bulk of bandwidth is tx relay, not block propagation, it would make more sense to attack the former rather than the latter. Especially given that the former still has plenty of low hanging fruit to grasp at.
What might really reduce bandwidth while still allowing relay, is to
a) compress transactions in p2p messages (ie. use UTXO pointers rather than TXIDs, TX templates encoding offsets rather than sizes. I reckon there's 20% or so savings here on average.) and use off-the-shelf compression to shave off another 5-10% or so.
b) switch signing algorithms to Schnorr, as segwit would allow us do. Giving us another 25% or so reduction in signature sizes, and waay more for multisig.
c) provide mental support for Adam Back, Greg Maxwell et. al. in their efforts of reducing CT commitment sizes ;)
Don't get me wrong, the effort here is to be applauded, but it does not warrant on-chain scaling in the way the group putting it out seems to suddenly deem possible.

However, Bitcoin is digital money which allows people to buy digital goods. It matters not what low-priced goods a user might purchase using this digital money: if one can find a way to consistently double-spend a zero-conf, then that can be abused to great effect.

SPV nodes - which typically don't care whether it's a hard or a soft fork, because they follow majority mining power - have to be lied to by everyone because in the hard fork option the merkle tree size doubles (transactions on the left, witnesses on the right).
They need the merkle depth for spv proofs, and they need the transaction count to compute the depth. In other words, except by lying to them (a hack, a disgusting hack I might add), they would break.
Also, I'm not fully sure, but I would expect many miners that depend on stratum will break. Which might be proxied or something, but a hack nonetheless.
We don't need to do this in the soft fork.

The primary advantages of segwit aren't its way of soft forking a block size increase - frankly, that's just a bonus.
It gives us fraud proofs for all consensus rules (whereas previously, the shortest such fraud proofs were the entire blockchain), it allows easy upgrading of script versions, it permanently fixes malleability, and it 'segregates the witness', which is probably the most significant scalability upgrade - the witness isn't something everyone needs; SPV cares only about an UTXO. They can perform better now that they can be thrown out of a transaction (while still allowing full nodes to validate them).
The worst-case overhead incurred by a segwit world is actually very minimal, relatively low complexity, way more capacity, and has the above significant advantages we didn't have before.
@_date: 2016-01-30 00:56:51

Does the bar accept opt-in RBF as a 0-conf? Does it account for it at all?
If the man is honest, then diddly will happen.
If the man is an attacker, he might attempt a double spend. He has this ability regardless of whether he pays with an RBF transaction or not - he is free to broadcast whatever transaction the network perceives as valid (and he may even attempt to broadcast invalid transactions, for all the network cares). The bar might notice a double spend, and attempt do something about it. Or they might not, hope for the best, and the attacker might get away with - or not. Or they explicitly don't, and account for it in a premium on price. They might account for it using a confirmation, or by not accepting Bitcoin in the first place, or by exploring, investigating or funding secure alternatives such as Lightning or perhaps even supporting GreenAddress-type transactions. It's in their interest, their choice, and it is their risk.
In any of the above cases, a 0-conf transaction fundamentally cannot be considered a guaranteed payment. A merchant might perceive it as such, but the risk to doing this is theirs, and nobody forced them to take this risk.

Not quite, you can still validate all the way up to now with all clients back to when Satoshi first released the software; no hard fork has ever occurred if seen from present time, if it had, then validating/syncing to the present tip of the chain would not be possible with the oldest of clients.
Dissimilarly, when we change the block size limit by hard fork, for example, no old client will be able to continue on the forked chain.
So, the incident/bug described above in actuality included 2 hard forks, where one negated the other (and itself) into inexistence. Therefore; it never happened.

The process of broadcasting a transaction, that transaction being confirmed, and over time having it solidify into the blockchain, *is very fundamentally a settlement process*.
This process has no explicit bearing on payment; there is no information in any of its components that necessarily indicates payment of any kind.
Having said that. It's perfectly possible to *employ* a settlement system such as Bitcoin's *for* payments, as Bitcoin has demonstrated since the beginning. However, that does not mean it is therefore a payment network, nor that this solution to having a payment infrastructure is ideal.
Bitcoin is an excellent form of money, it is an excellent method of sharing global state information, but it is not an excellent form of payment.
Networks such as the Lightning Network - networks that can provide the use cases desired for payment in a scalable and cost effective way - can better describe payment networks.

Seen strictly from a technical perspective, 0.8 was an unintentional hard fork, downgrading back to 0.7 or patching it up was, strictly (and only during that time), another hard fork that reverted that hard fork. This 'hard fork' really had no effect, though, because it triggered a reorg rather than kept working on the 18 billion chain.
Historically and seen from present time, no fork occurred - just a reorganisation (for which no evidence exists within the blockchain). In other words, it never happened. :)

Try sending a transaction with a sub-par fee. It'll be stuck for a long time. You'll have *hours* to get your double-spend into a miner's radar.
Try sending a transaction that appears fully valid, high fee and everything, that builds on top of an unconfirmed transaction chain, same story.

The point of miners creating proofs-of-work isn't to form a shared definition on rules, it's to achieve consensus over the past *given* a set of rules. That's literally all it is. It has *zero* bearing on forming rules.
The rules are defined by the users of the network.


It's impossible to have shared consensus on the past without also sharing the perspective/rules that govern it.


It matters because not having a full and validated perspective on the entirety of the state of the ledger makes the 'checking' of your own transactions potentially useless. It's SPV security; it's *probably* fine so long as miners are honest, all the while knowing that miners have an incentive to lie. It's a *very* far cry away from the security and certainty a full node can give its operator.


The notion of a 'store-chain' or 'proof-chain' or 'history-chain' is an interesting one to pursue as an altcoin, but purely academic in the context of Bitcoin; a chain wherein a globally shared ledger is at its foundation.

Despite the debate we've have been having for the past year, a full 100% of users are in consensus over the consensus ruleset for the simple reason that everyone who isn't, is not part of the network.


Bitcoin describes a mechanism to achieve consensus over *the past*, not the future. Miners define an ordering of transactions in a decentralized distributed voluntary timestamping-server via proof-of-work sort of way.
I like to employ this sentence:
*Miners solidify the past, they malleate the present, and they stay the hell away from the future.*
Bitcoin *does not* describe, or currently employ, a mechanism to achieve consensus over altering an already agreed-upon consensus ruleset, as the debate of the past year demonstrates. It is both one of its strengths, aswell as a major weakness.

Big government without corporations, i.e. without property rights, leads to leninist and stalinist communism. The problem is, again, big government.
The solution is small or no government, wherein the people outright reject any and all state meddling with the economy.
There is only very little government power for corporations to wield, the legitimate use of force does not get corrupted by corporate interest, and capitalism will present.
The trick is getting this right. The US was the best attempt so far, but has over 200 years eroded into a mostly authoritarian surveillance hellscape, boasting the largest and most powerful military might in the world wielded by the state. Oh well.
On communism: communism doesn't work and goes against people's nature. However, when sufficiently determined people organise in defiance of nature, as some communes have in the past demonstrated (eg. the Kibbutz), it is possible for communism to not result in the misery and death of all. That is, when communism isn't imposed on the people by big government, but carried by the people from within themselves, it can function fine (until they inevitably realise they prefer private property and abolish communism, as the Kibbutz have). However, the common denominator with the corruption of communism/socialism, as it is with the corruption of capitalism, is big government. Or as Bakunin said: "When the people are being beaten with a stick, they are not much happier if it is called "the People's Stick""

The use cases over using any other policy aren't that impressive *yet*, I agree. If they were the only reason to move to it, then that would be a poor reason to do it in a short-term timeframe. The real and actual reason is that 0-conf is insecure, and RBF aligns with the Bitcoin security model, while suggesting that another policy such as FSP does so aswell is wrong.


They won't. The use-cases apply far better to automated and incredibly smart machines/software doing these optimisations - as far as I perceive it.


Peter Todd gave some examples many months ago. I'll look it up and edit it in after this write-up.
// edit: 


And rightfully so, but this is far from sudden. They have been portrayed as being insecure for a very long time - for as long as I can remember.


I do claim this. On-blockchain transactions are not suitable for 0-conf instantaneous payments.
What's so unfortunate is that there aren't any applicable alternatives available yet. GreenAddress-like transaction schemes are poorly (if at all) adopted. The Lightning Network is what can truly deliver on instant payments - but we are still a far cry away from it. This is why Core is opting for opt-in RBF as the reference policy (fully knowing they do not and cannot solve the fundamental problems with 0-conf payments) rather than full-RBF. Various discussions in recent PRs demonstrated this.
See this for a full account of *how I perceive* the adoption of RBF:

Fees are split 40/60 with the current block leader and the next block leader (to incentivise the next block leader to build on top of the block of the current block leader).
This means there is now an incentive to (as a user) directly pay the current block leader a fee out-of-band (contract, micropayment channel, cash money, whatever) at an up to 60% discount. The same incentive exists for the current block leader to receive/accept out-of-band fee payments, because they would be higher than the 40% they would otherwise get.
This means the 40/60 split to incentivise building on the current block leader's block is potentially eliminated - provided many people do these out-of-band fee payments (which .. everyone has incentive for)
If there is no incentive to build on the current block leader's block, the system breaks. (The blockchain can't move forward; miners would build on the most recent block that pays them)
Secondarily (and primarily to some), NG 'elects' a leader which is known for ~10 minutes, which might make that leader vulnerable to DDoS during that time.

Gravity well difficulty adjustments is meh because it makes a mining eclipse attack less costly and harder to detect.
The 2-week lagging difficulty target in Bitcoin is a subtle but important protection for such attacks.
The potential downside of a sudden hashrate drop (however unlikely) is something the network will have to bear. Keep in mind it's never happened before to any significant extent - and probably only will in extraordinary circumstances (ie. contentious hard fork, thermonuclear war, or a solar superflare type event) in which case we have larger problems.

@_date: 2016-03-14 16:24:36
That all depends on what the wallet's capabilities and privacy (and other) considerations might be.
What entity does the wallet ask for the fee? A third party service? If so, what information does it send that party in order for it to determine an appropriate fee? What knowledge might that third party derive from it? If not (it calculates a fee itself), does the wallet have access to the p2p network / tx relay? Previous blocks? Or even the UTXO set? Does it validate at all? Can it? Or is it SPV and does it have none of that?
If it fetches a fee by looking at the mempool, what's to prevent it from being tricked into setting too high or too low a feerate? If it's looking at prev blocks, what's to say a transaction will be included in a reasonably timed next block? Should it take first-seen in mempool and block inclusion metrics into account at all?
And what if the wallet knows nothing? Should it 'guess', have the user decide, try a higher fee each time and rely on RBF to replace it?
How does it respond to changing conditions? Newer miner policies? Differing network relay policies?
Sorry for responding with 20 more questions ;) But the problem of what fee to set is a shitty one to solve, unfortunately.

An individual's ability to transact freely has remained unaffected throughout this entire ordeal.


Presumably, users that desire to run a full node care.


Well now we've arrived at this particular trade-off.
Am I justified in creating mountains worth of spam and expecting it all to be included in the blockchain? What should be the cost of running a node? What, if not cost, is to stop me from backing up my HD movie collection on the blockchain? What is the measure by which spam is identified? And what is the whip we should employ to rid ourselves of it? By what mandate can the network choose to expel those it deems unworthy of participation?
We are nowhere near the point where any of these questions can be answered.
What we can better explore, though, is the means by which we take advantage of the network. The tools we employ to use it most cost effectively. And that is precisely what development toward an actual solution has been moving toward in the past year; the Lightning Network.

Ah, great ;)
From the honest sender's perspective - assuming they will not make use of the added beneficial features, which I think at least for now is a safe bet to make, because these features are seldom relevant - then, indeed, signalling for opt-in RBF in a transaction has no point.
From a merchant's perspective that doesn't rely on 0-conf, it makes no difference. They are unaffected either way.
0-conf accepting merchants should look for the flag/nSequence in the transaction, and not accept any that signal for opt-in RBF as payment until the first confirmation. While also understanding they are not all of the sudden free of the risk of being double spent.
For nodes - they can choose whatever they want, whatever best aligns with their preference/ideology. And miners are, save the "we'll sell this shitcoin"-fear, economically incentivised to run - at least - opt-in RBF.

That's a good question actually, don't know exactly.


GreenAddress signs each transaction with its own key in addition to client-side signing by user's keys, and funds are stored in 2-of-2 multisignature outputs requiring both signatures to spend. The drawback of it is that you cannot control your funds without GreenAddress' signature, so you are right to worry that you can lose your coins.








I'll do some research and edit it in.

I don't think you understand how this works..
A proper exchange has the vast majority of custodial funds locked away in multisig offline wallets. They should hardly ever be touched given normal operation.

Corporatism means that the actions of private entities, corporations, are indistinguishable from those of the state. That is, they are part of the state monopoly on the legitimate use of force.
In practice we see this in the form of lobbyist unions (eg. EU's Brussels, and US's Washington DC) where private corporations collude with government to produce policy not endorsed or created by the people.
Both socialists and capitalists are squarely against this sort of thing, which is why the whole socialism vs capitalism false dichotomy in today's discourse is so utterly absurd.
(Of course, there is a true dichotomy when it comes to socialism vs capitalism, but the critique that either has of the other is baseless when pointing at today's reality for evidence. For example, when socialists say the current system is capitalist, and its x y or z bad outcomes are therefore the fault of capitalism, they are wrong, and vice versa)

Absolutely. Only when IBLTs, Lightning and SW are in place, and, *crucially*, some sane way to determine consensus and deploy a hard fork, might we start thinking about increasing base block size to values larger than 1MB. With LN in place alone, and at today's block sizes - we can already scale to unfathomable throughputs if used efficiently. And at that point - higher base block sizes might be sane.
Then in maybe 5-10 years or so - we might hard fork into a blockchain model that can actually scale. Braiding, as a a start, as presented on the Scaling Bitcoin conference, sounded *very* promising in solving some fundamental problems - but who knows what we'll end up with by then.


That sure isn't the future I'm intending to portray. I fully believe we can keep node operation cheap and easy, while still allowing for a far greater transaction throughput than is possible today. LN alone can achieve this even at today's limits.

The thing about money is that it is very tough to live on without using it. It doesn't taste very well. It doesn't hold all of the sustenance humans typically need. It only keeps you warm for a few seconds when you burn it. It's useless, really.
The best thing you can do is spend it in exchange for bread on other things of such nature. It's weird.
This argument stems from a branch of economy that has managed to take the humanity out of human interaction. Which is weird, because as any child might tell the economist, is that the human is central to human interaction.

So again, RBF does not suggest accepting 0-conf transactions as payment is secure.
There is no 0-conf related attack vector to a merchant that chooses not to accept such transactions as payment (only on 1 or multiple confirmations).
RBF does, however, let a sender (attempt to) replace transactions when it is still in the unconfirmed window. He may use this to do whatever he chooses - he might bump the fee, he might include more/different inputs and more/different outputs, he might alter payment amounts, anything. Sensible use cases are those that optimise; bundle multiple transactions into one, add more priority/fee to a transaction, things like this.
All of this replacing is perfectly fine; the recipient has not yet accepted any receiving transaction as payment, so he does not explicitly care about what happens to unconfirmed transactions. For the rational and sensible sender it is also fine; he may optimise his unconfirmed transactions, paying a smaller fee for more 'umpf'. For the network, it's excellent, optimised transactions impose lesser strain on its operation. It's win-win-win.
Attack vectors are eliminated, weak security assumptions are further discouraged, network efficiency increased.
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:11:58

All miners really do is *set* the order in which transactions have taken place in stone, observing rules where one transaction's input must be referring to another *previous* transaction's output.
The actual ordering is set *in* the block, not *by* the block.
So a single block can have these three transactions, *in exactly this order* (excluding coinbase):
    Spend outputOld to outputA
    Spend outputA to outputB
    Spend outputB to outputC
The actual 'coins' previously held by outputOld have been spent 3 times in this one block. No problem.
While many wallets disallow spending unconfirmed coins (for reasons), it is perfectly supported by the network.

We are very fortunate this network's (technical) userbase is - for a large part - benevolent, and would like to see Bitcoin succeed - but assuming this will forever be the case is misleading.


Well that's the entire problem. The alternative (ie. first-seen) suggests it provides security while it doesn't. Business have come to rely on this perception and built use cases around it, which is what's unfortunate - because those use cases are broken.
Of course, it is those businesses' choice to continue to function on top of those use cases - it is their risk. But there is nothing they can do about the network not catering to these insecure use-cases, and opting for another that better aligns with the system as a whole.

Fine. I may have made a leap in saying that 'what you want them to do' is equal to 'what long term incentives would lead them to do'. Admittedly, I think that's what many of our exchanges appear to wind down to.


Why? Bitcoin is designed to resolve double spends, so I don't know why this would be true?


Miners aren't the ones that instigate double spends, why should they be hurt? And why should a double spend be news?
I mean, literally, double spends are a non-issue if Bitcoin is used correctly - Bitcoin doing its job in not allowing double spends isn't particularly newsworthy imo.

Individual pool miners weren't _part_ of the newly minted block; they either provided the full solution, or they didn't.
While mining, they provide the pool with shares, these shares satisfy a proof-of-work difficulty that is substantially lower than the required difficulty. These prove to the pool operator that the pool miner contributes a ~given hashrate to the pool, and allows him to reliably reward him for the work, knowing the work was done for the pool's coinbase
This proves it privately to the pool operator. Identification of 'who' proved something here, however, is just naively self-reported/trusted and there is no cryptography involved (I assume, could be signed but there's really no point since it's a trusted proof anyway)
To prove the same thing publicly, and I mean really prove it, you need to publish the share, and tie it cryptographically to your identity. Otherwise, you couldve simply stolen the share from another pool miner. In practice, you need to sign some unique text, and embed the signature or its hash, the proof, in it (eg. into the scriptsig in the 0th input), then disclose to the world your identity's public key.
I believe many miners permit pool miners to insert some number of bytes into the scriptsig, these are usually used for nicknames and suck, but you can put your proof there and it'll prove the share is yours

Not necessarily. More transactions in a block generally imposes a greater barrier to validation for individuals. For individuals to validate and have certainty over the correctness of the contents of the blockchain is what makes Bitcoin possible in the first place; it isn't a positive thing when this property disappears.
Many participants in this system, probably chief among which being Core, are trying to make the barrier to validation a bearable task for individuals to perform, by building software that is more performant, and propose and work on upgrades to the system that scale, rather than attempt to do away with any possibility of participation outright by promoting the cramming of more transactions into blocks.

Some people _[link to Reuters, who refers to Coindesk, who refers to a slide in a presentation of the State of Bitcoin/Blockchain 2016, wherein a meaningless god damned pie chart depicts that 80% of exchange volume is coming from OKCoin and Huobi]_ say that China did it. (...)
Most Bitcoin use is in China, because said people say so. (...)
Many computers store Bitcoin rather than a central authority.
These computers mine bitcoins. (...)
Halving is coming up next month. Halving means there will be 12.5 BTC per 'block'. This means mining will be half as profitable (...)

[Waiting for] confirmations is a necessary part of achieving global agreement on the actual state of the network. There is no way around it without switching to another set of security assumption trade-offs.
One such trade-off is the Lightning Network, wherein you can be instantly confident of having received irreversible payment, at the expense of locking funds down in a contract, and being required to [or paying to externalise this task] monitor the blockchain.
The Lightning Network is being developed and requires CSV and Segwit to function optimally.
Another trade-off is to require the party paying you to pay in a green-address-style fashion, which trades off the possibility of having a payment double-spent with an assumption of trust in a third party. Green-address-style payments are possible today and are offered by GreenAddress ( and BitGo Instant (

Segwit adoption is not measured by miners signalling support. But yeah.


See this excellent article:
TL;DR with _my own bias_:
Some seem to be experiencing technical difficulties (F2Pool) because they can't build C++11. This should be resolved at some point, but there seems to not be any rush here.
Some other pools are of the opinion that what's happening is a vote, and that individual miners should be able to decide whether their hashing power should signal for segwit or not (Slush, BW Pool).
While pools are certainly free and encouraged to offer choice to the actual miners, what should not be forgotten is that segwit/BIP9 signaling is not a voting process; it's a signalling process for software compatibility.
Slush already offers a choice similar in principle to how they offered a choice for Classic. 
No word from BW pool yet.
BTCC, BitFury and BitClub are signaling support.
GBMiners, a new pool that I thought was hostile to segwit, will apparently signal segwit support in the near future.
There's 1 (+1 depending on opinion) pool that is expressly trying to block segwit currently; ViaBTC, by running Bitcoin Unlimited. ViaBTC is basically just a front for Jihan's AntPool.
Roger Ver's bitcoin.com is 'neutral', though they are supposedly also running BU, and being dicks in general. (opinion mine). So I'm gonna stick bitcoin.com in the 'block' camp.
Some other pools are just like 'nah, we're not changing anything and screw your politics' (Kano CK Pool), which I think is the best attitude. Or not saying anything (1hash), which is also an excellent way to go about things. (really though, so long as there's obscure conservative pools like these that won't change consensus rulesets based on whim, we'll be absolutely fine)
All other large pools that are not signaling currently, I presume, are waiting for BitMain / Jihan Wu to raise the thumb, and he won't until his childlike desire for a hard fork is fulfilled.
This is AntPool and BTC.com - and ViaBTC and bitcoin.com of course, because without Jihan they don't have a leg to stand on. Effectively some ~35% of the hashrate.
HaoBTC is abstaining for reasons that I can't explain.
What annoys me most about the rollout so far is the continuing misinterpretation of BIP9 as a voting process, which isn't helped by the fact that on the outside it indeed looks and behaves much like a voting process. BIP9 is an activation mechanism that can only work during times of absolute peace, which I don't think we'll ever go back to in Bitcoin (which is fine; a money works perfectly well and even benefits when its users have competing interests) -- however, this does mean that BIP9 is not suitable for activating anything any longer, because miners can trivially leverage their newly given 'veto' property to block any change/upgrade to the system until their political goals that are unrelated to the upgrade in question are satisfied.

Indeed, there is very little difference between no RBF, opt-in RBF and full RBF because unconfirmed transactions are replaceable in all cases. So the correct solution is to go with full RBF.

No, they are useless and confuse the hell out of everyone that touches the protocol.
The endianness is engrained in the consensus ruleset here and there because they are fed into hash algorithms, unfortunately, so redesigning them requires a hard fork.

Mining is quantum proof because it is based on hashes/SHA256 which is not trivially vulnerable like ECDSA is.
Addresses are quantum proof because they are hashes of public keys, which dramatically reduces the window the public key is vulnerable.
Also if only the address is public (which is the case for all non-reused addresses) then schemes may be soft forked in that guarantee its being spent in a certain way that is quantum proof. (by committing to a spend beforehand and enforcing only that spend be allowed through soft fork consensus)
Reused addresses are vulnerable because the public key is... public, and the private key may be derived from it somewhat trivially with a working quantum computer. Likely if quantum computers are ever usefully created, then a soft fork would be rolled out making all such outputs unspendable.
In any case, quantum computers are farther away from being useful in practice than most people seem to think.

I assure you these are not technicalities.


Non-mining nodes hardly affect relevant propagation latency because miners relay their blocks on faster and more specialized networks such as FIBRE.


I don't know what you're saying here.
The actual impact full nodes have on the network at large is the fact that they provide the reason for a miner not to inflate the money supply by counterfeiting, and everything else they can do when nobody cares whether the blocks they produce are valid, such as stealing money.
_That_ is what nodes do, and _that_ is why users who fully validate the ledger using theirgovern this network. Not miners.


The _only_ limited power miners are given is the ability to produce new blocks. Users determine the validity of those blocks.
Indeed if miners would be able to tell users whether blocks are valid and the network became solely dependent on them telling the truth, they would certainly lie at the earliest convenience. Such is their nature, and this is its design.

Still rocking the 1MB limit, the annual ritual to propose a segwit activation window of one year will be an event to be reckoned with (by then it is approaching its 85th anniversary!).

There exists no mechanism for 51% of miners to change any rule, so I don't know how you can conclude that 51% of miners determine consensus.
Certainly it wouldn't be much of a consensus if 51% can change the way the 49% work. That is democracy, and it does not exist in Bitcoin.
You may come to understand why miners don't determine the rules by answering some of these questions:
Why does a miner mine on top of the best chaintip, as opposed to any other chaintip he might better prefer.
Why do miners halve the coinbase minting reward every 4 years? They could give themselves more money.
Why does a miner not include any double spends?
It's game theory that answers each of these questions, and each of these questions have the same answer: Because users running fully validating nodes only accept the best valid chain, and none other.
In any case, nodes can't censor. They can filter their mempool however they please, just like I can ignore what Trump says about how big of a wall he wants to build, but that isn't censorship, that's just a mempool policy the individual node has free reign over.
Miners, on the other hand, when sufficiently organised and willing (51% and adversarial), can censor transactions, by orphaning any blocks that include transactions they want to censor.

Addresses are used like endpoints, not like accounts that have a balance. Individual bitcoins are kept in 'Unspent Transaction Outputs', which are like physical coins or notes. If you spend your bitcoins, like physical coins or notes, you have to spend the entire coin/note and receive the remainder as change.
You can 'spend' the change back to the 'from' address (though there strictly is no such thing as a 'from' address) but that ruins your privacy and undermines security (because the public key for that address would be visible).
In ancient times, people used to do this. However, the practice has rightfully been replaced with more secure practices that don't reuse addresses.

It is important to understand what it means to participate in Bitcoin. You participate by validating the money properties of this system yourself, while independent of external influences. By doing that, it is impossible to use the money while it diverges from that consensus ruleset, because you yourself have taken part in establishing it; validate the money, and it cannot diverge - you will not fork.
Any and all efforts made by BU or whatever other entity attempting to coerce the network into some form other than the present one is, then, immediately futile.
Of course, any individual is free to deteriorate the consensus ruleset however they see fit, which the BU crew has done to their and their user's own detriment.


If the BU userbase is sufficiently resolved to pursue their presumed current course of action (which is pretty hard to distinguish from a random walk), then sure - there may at some point be 2 monies that share a great deal of Bitcoin's history. Here, it is important to point out that anyone is free to do this already, and has been since the start, and in fact it has already happened plenty of times. (ie. 
In the end all that matters is that you value the consensus ruleset you're validating for, for your individual participation in this network, which is what makes this money the money you want it to be.

(Merge mined) Sidechains aren't all that interesting anymore because the best they can offer is SPV security if a node opts not to also validate the sidechain, which would be very reasonable for a node _not_ to do.
Federated sidechains (sidechains that aren't merge mined, but federated by some group of signers) like Testnet's Alpha chain seem to be better suited to the sidechains's original premise of functioning as an experimental testing grounds that doesn't need to have a currency bootstrapped on top of it. Interest, for the most part, has shifted here. However, federated sidechains are inherently not suitable for various features many people thought sidechains to be suitable for, such as scaling. They are, instead, better suited for application- or use-case specific ventures that can bear the limitation of being run, maintained and secured by a group of known entities, rather than Bitcoin's potentially anonymous miners.
Projects like these include things like Blockstream's Liquid, a project set to provide greater liquidity to Bitcoin's exchanges and processors through the use of a federated sidechain.
// Edit: It should be noted, that things such as Liquid _do_ offload the main Bitcoin blockchain, and thus _can_ be considered a scaling solution in much the same way Changetip can be considered a scaling solution, with the primary distinction being that Liquid is auditable, and cryptographically strong, while things like Changetip are unequivocally not.

With only a few minutes of internet and no funny stuff, probably not. Like an internet connected machine, it's possible to secure your wallet reasonably well, but it takes some effort, research and care (connected or unconnected) to make yourself sure of that.
Some pointers:
- Don't do this on Windows. Use some Linux distribution. Ubuntu is easy even for absolute beginners.
- Compile your own bitcoind or verify the binary signatures.
- Don't connect usb or other media if it has touched a machine that is remotely suspect. Preferably format the media or don't use it period.
- Probably most importantly: don't advertise this machine or its connection as a machine that holds Bitcoin to anyone.
- Backup an encrypted wallet somewhere safe.

Good news: there is an alternative proposal that can get us there in half the time it takes for BIP109 to activate without controversy and/or destroying confidence in the network!
If BIP109 is meant to be a can-kick solution and nothing else, then one could suppose this alternative is better in all respects.

Just a bare full node, it can even be pruned.
Ideally the node should have -txindex so that all historic transactions can be looked up.
Addresses work when the node supports -addrindex, btcdrak's addrindex fork supports that. 
The one on srv1.yogh.io is pruned to 150GB or so I believe.
Also works on testnet and other similarly formatted blockchains, just point it toward a full node and it'll talk to it.
Without pruning, and with txindex and addrindex, it takes up about 200GB.

What node monetization does is change the reason for an individual to be running a node / participating in the network from a means to _add_ value _to_ the network, to a means to _subtract_ value _from_ the network.
Imagine I'm a free thinking individual willing to partake in a money of which the control lies not with a single entity but all those who participate.
I believe to have found such a money, but the cost to participate in it is prohibitively high. To remedy this, the other participants of the money are donating me a little bit of it, in order to include me in the network.
Beyond this being economically infeasible to support for all of the money's participants, my participation in that network is now dependent on the chunk of money donated to me by it, and as such, any changes to that donation - internal or external - change my relation with the money such that any control I have over it is reliant on the donation. Remove the donation, and my means of control disappears, increase the donation, and my means of control corrupt (and for those fabled uncorruptible few among us, you stand to be replaced by those who do corrupt).
More concretely, node monetization introduces a tragedy of the commons that causes the effective operation of the network to be performed by actors who are reliant on the network paying them. What, daresay, would drive this group of actors to do anything other than maximise their reason of existence, to the ends of maximising their handout?
The goals of bribery are irrelevant when there is an incentive that leaves one open to it.

Yes, precisely the same incentives cause miners to maximise their own profits. As intended, by the way; the network is intending to 'buy' proofs of work that have specifically arisen out of such competitive profit maximising conditions. But miners also _can't_ suitably _operate_ the network for that reason; the incentives cause them not to act in the best interest of the network but, effectively, to its maximum survivable detriment..
Nodes operated by individuals seeking to, in their own self-interest, _utilise_ Bitcoin for its money properties - not to receive a paycheck for the act of validating - have the all-important incentive to preserve those money properties. Hence, those are the nodes we want to see operate the network, which is how the network is currently set up.

When the cost to mine reaches equilibrium with price, means that all of the mining reward is to be sold for electrivity/upkeep/etc., and none/minimal amount is hodl'd by the miner as profit. This, then, means that the maximum of mining reward falling down on the market has been reached, which is a bullish signal. Not a price floor, but also not meaningless.

Everyone in the Bitcoin network that runs a full node validates all transactions that have happened in Bitcoin's entire history.
Miners are given a considerable incentive to validate transactions - though they are not strictly required to. If they don't validate transactions / make sure the block they produce is valid, then all fully validating nodes will reject that block.
Anyone using a SPV/lite/web wallet is trusting the miners or someone else that transactions they are seeing pass by are valid. Full nodes, on the other hand, can make themselves certain the transactions they are seeing are valid.

The USD in its fiat form was created in 1971 when it stopped representing a weight of gold. Heavy devuation since.
European fiat monies including the Pound Sterling stopped getting effectively backed by gold in 1971 due to bretton woods collapse. Heavy devaluation since.
The Chinese Yuan (during the dynasty) was the first fiat, undergoing reform every 20 or so years due to heavy devaluation.

TL;DR: Yes, a pruned node has validated everything and does not compromise its security in any way.
It is important to distinguish between the blockchain (journal) and the UTXO-set (ledger).
The blockchain is merely a record of all transactions in Bitcoin's history.
When playing it back start-to-finish one may produce the UTXO-set; the database containing all presently unspent transaction outputs.
The purpose of a full node is to validate whether all transactions in the journal are valid, and to produce the ledger, which it may use to validate transactions into the future. If a node validated past transactions, those transactions may be discarded in full. Only the ledger need remain, because only the ledger is needed to preserve the money function of this system.
The only reason nodes traditionally do not discard the entire blockchain after validation, is mainly twofold:
1 - To serve others the full journal.
It is vital for the network to function into the future that new users may always fetch the blockchain in some way.
2 - To handle reorganisations.
When multiple chaintips are resolved into a single chaintip (ie. one chaintip is orphaned by the node because another chaintip has accrued more work), a reorganisation occurs. The node will revert back to the point where the chaintips forked, and playback on the new chaintip. The node needs past blocks to revert back.
It is expected, at this point, that there will always be enough nodes to bootstrap others; many Bitcoin companies, miners and individuals have an interest to make the full blockchain available. So long as resources are not strained too greatly, this will not be a problem.
Reorganisations seldomly are multiple blocks deep, so to keep the entire blockchain to account for this scenario, rather than a past few, is not needed.
In other words, if a node keeps blocks sufficiently far back to handle reorgs, it is entirely safe to prune the blockchain, keeping only the ledger. The Bitcoin Core node has a minimal pruning setting of 550MB ~~, and 144 blocks (1 day's worth) - meaning, it will at minimum store 144 blocks _and_ 550MB~~ worth of blocks. Which is (more than) sufficient to handle all reasonably conceivable reorgs.
(//edit: I seem to have made up the 144 blocks bit: slightly sleep deprived)


TL;DR: Yes, but it's not the same as a full node as a result of not having 100% certainty.
An SPV node currently does not exist as it has been described in the Satoshi white paper - it is doubtful this mode of operation is possible in the first place in the way described.
The Satoshi white paper described a node that would accept alerts signaling fraud from its peers, and subsequently download and validate the entire block to verify. There's some problems with this: downloading and validating individual blocks is not possible and meaningless because you need a UTXO set to validate against, which an SPV node does and cannot securely have. Further, a fraud 'alert' rather than a fraud proof is easily faked, and so this introduces a significant DDoS vector, or some sort of trust/reputation network (to accept only alerts from trusted/known peers). There's more problems with fraud 'alerts'/proofs, but I'll not get into them because they are mostly game theoretical, leading to possibly undesired behavior - but is not technically relevant.
That's the Satoshi interpretation/definition of an SPV node, and none exist today.
The 'SPV' mode of operation that people mean when they say 'SPV node', in practice means something other than the Satoshi definition. It effectively means "trust the miners". These nodes follow the highest-work ch ain, and trust that the transactions inside them are valid. In order for miners or anyone else to lie to you, they need to produce a valid proof-of-work block, and either trick you into believing you are looking at the highest-work chain, have majority hashrate, or commit their fraud before their invalid block-height is overtaken by the 'honest' network.
As such this mode of operation is 'probably' fine so long as these nodes wait for a sufficient number of confirmations. In the end, though, these nodes cannot know whether the chain they are looking at is valid, or whether the money they are sending up and about actually exists. Unlike full (pruned) nodes.

"Cancelled" in the natural sense of the word, no.
But they can be replaced with another valid transaction, if miners so choose to. To do this, you'll have to double-spend it, and rather than send the money to A, send it to B.
To incentivize miners to mine the second transaction rather than the first, you'd have to increase the fee.
Replace-by-fee is the preferred method to do this.
However, many miners currently run the opt-in replace-by-fee variety, which means the initial transaction needs to 'opt-in' to this 'feature' explicitly before they'll replace it.
In the end, it all comes down to the miners and what they end up putting in a block.
A sender must always consider his broadcast transaction final and irreversible - even if in some edge cases it may be reversed or changed.
Contrarily, a _recipient_ must _never_ consider a broadcast transaction [that he didn't sign ie. as part of multisig] final and irreversible - only when it is included in a block, which is sufficiently confirmed, ought that be considered true.

Pruning along with headers-first already lets you do all you request.
By pruning you can 'forget' transactions as they are spent, by using headers-first you can skip full validation of historic transactions as you synchronize with the network (if those transactions/blocks have a vast amount of work on top of them, similar to centralized checkpointing, but better) - at the cost of trusting that the network was honest in the (distant) past.
(Note both of this is optional)
The primary advantage of UTXO commitments is for a way to let SPV clients know about unspent transactions - under (existing) SPV security. And also (secondarily) to allow for the operation of 'not-full' nodes (not full because they have not fully validated) - as for the latter, there's really no point if you ask me.

Clearly that can only be valid with a very limited selection of 'everybody'. There's a strong dependency on first-seen and 0-conf payments in this ecosystem.


RBF is the very thing that exemplifies that fact in a decentralized way. As PTodd says in the video; better to have RBF than to work with centralized mining contracts.
@_date: 2015-08-10 13:15:56
There's various purposes/advantages to the block size limit, regardless of the reason it was first 'hacked in'.
1) It offers validators (nodes, primarily) some modicum of certainty over whether they can take the strain imposed on them in the future: If miners start profitably generating 1GB blocks all of the sudden (for whatever reason), then most independent validators can likely not keep up (thus hurting decentralization), nodes enforcing a block size limit prevents this.
2) It forces the blockchain size to grow slowly. New validators starting from scratch can get up to speed fully pretty soon, rather than sync for weeks or months.
3) There's no huge advantage big miners (xx% hashrate) have over small miners (0.x% hashrate), or well-resourced miners (very well connected, low latencies, high throughputs) have over poorly-resourced miners (China-type connections, huge latency, low throughput). Which could otherwise skew incentives. (arguably not a problem at all)


The size of the mempool isn't really relevant for these spam attacks, just temporarily at best. The size of the UTXO set and the validation time is. The UTXO set grows after such spam transactions are actually being mined by miners rather than discarded after lingering in the mempool. They are forever part of bitcoin's history and thus need to be kept in the UTXO set, and validated by everyone, today and in the future. If that transaction is spam, then that's not great.
Increasing the limit causes this potential problem to grow. No limit causes the problem to potentially grow unbounded.
That said. I believe validators (nodes) can permit themselves to be agnostic over what they are validating; whether it's spam or legitimate transacting. It's a miners' jobs to filter what does and does not go in the blockchain. Validators should only care about whether or not they can handle the strain. So from the validators' perspective, the limit can go up by quite a bit; most decent nodes are running idle. BIP 101 is (in my opinion) too optimistic, BIP 103 sounds better, although it starts off pretty low.

Well not exactly, it's just a large number encoded into the alphanumeric combination known as BASE58(CHECK).
The private key is a 256 bit number. Randomly *generated*.
Through ECDSA it is computed into the public key, which is a 512 bit coordinate that is typically compressed into 33 bytes.
The public key is hashed through SHA256 (resulting in 256 bits) and then RIPE-MD (resulting in 160 bits)
This 160 bit number is your address. It is then encoded using BASE58CHECK. It adds a version (1 byte at the front) and a checksum (4 bytes at the back), resulting in 200 bits which are then encoded using a 58 character alphabet, resulting in the 33-34 characters you *know* as the address.

True enough. Which is why the argument should be about ways we can move away from dependencies on first-seen policies rather than outright adopting RBF overnight.
There's plenty of ways available already, and plenty of room for improvement still. But the argument is about whether we can somehow 'fix' first-seen, which we factually cannot.

Any transactions below their minfee still need to be validated if those transactions show up in a block.


I'm not at all concerned about the size of the transaction set in the mempool. If the size of the mempool is of any concern then whatever transaction has been relayed can in fact be safely pruned off until it shows up in a block.
This can be done regardless of what the block size is.
I'm more concerned with a growing UTXO set as a result of spam that's been included in the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:52:20
Yes, BIP100 proposes this.
The problem with this proposal is (warning: opinion piece) that this leaves the adjusting of the block size completely up to miners. They can still skyrocket the allowed maximum block size to thresholds where fewer and fewer nodes are able to validate, albeit very slowly.
^(BIP100 does have a 32MB hard limit that is already present as a p2p message size limit, but I'm gonna disregard that for this concept, which I think itself puts too much control in the hands of miners)
@_date: 2015-08-31 06:09:09
Headers-first allows you to identify the best chain before having the entire blockchain. This, then, allows you to select which parts you can confidently skip full validation for (such as anything 100k blocks deep, or some amount of work deep)
(didn't say we're already doing this, we're still using checkpoints as far as I'm aware - but this type of mechanism is in the pipeline to replace them)
Confidence in UTXO commitments is based on depth, not height. Meaning, confidence only increases as you approach genesis, it decreases as you approach the tip.
If what you mean is taking a historic UTXO commitment, and starting validation from there (rather than genesis) all the way up to now. Then I'd say yes, that's a viable way to do a full-enough validation.
@_date: 2015-08-03 07:59:00
You don't know the supply available in the market.
We know the *money* supply added through the protocol, but whether or not that supply hits the market - or whether other coins someone else earned somehow other than minting - is not directly and deterministically known or (very) predictable. Same goes for demand.

I've been pondering for a way to do this using nothing but Bitcoin Core myself as it happens, the most straightforward way of doing it is, as you've found:


Realistically that's what's gonna have to happen anyway ;) whether you do it yourself, or Bitcoin Core, makes negligible difference.
Some other thing that may work but I'm not a huge fan of (using Vanilla Core v0.10 and up):
    importaddress "address"
For a bunch of addresses generated using an xpub.. you'll need to -rescan if there's any transactions in the xpub, which takes a long while and isn't ideal. You'll also have a shitload of watch-only addresses in your wallet, while even compiling the wallet is undesired for most applications (imo).
What's viable, is this:
Using a patch for Core like:  you'll have an index for every address. You can trivially look up outputs/transactions for whatever address you've generated out of the xpub. Then check if any of the outputs are spent/unspent - and you'll arrivate at a balance.
Downside is, this will only work on a patched Bitcoin Core. But it'll be quick and smooth - sort of.
(full disclosure: I haven't implemented any of the above, only looked for ways to do it some time in the future when I have time. So I don't know which currently unforeseen problems lie ahead ;) )

Mike did BitcoinJ, which is a big part of the reason the SPV wallets we're all using are at least somewhat viable. Gavin has done a shitload of code (in the early days, not for the last 2 years or so), and more recently pioneered the BIP70 / payment protocol efforts, and appears to be working on IBLT (which looks to be becoming increasingly unviable).
But all of that pales with what the 'real' core devs have done and are doing. Lightning and Elements is impressive as fuck. libsecp256k1 is impressive as fuck. Headers-first along with pruning and the 100x or so performance improvement of Bitcoin Core, is impressive as fuck.

I wouldn't [prefer miners to soft fork into a 'suitable' limit], not unless the [hard] limit (or increase schedule thereof) is sufficiently low I can be confident I can always spin up a node and fully validate the chain.
I can't be confident of that without a limit, or a soft forked 'miner merit' limit, or something ridiculously optimistic like BIP 101.
But yes, if there were no 1MB limit in the first place, then, factually, adding one would be a soft fork.
Don't be too eager to trust miners to act in anyone's best interest but their own. I, instead, fully expect them to leave the network or their decentralized ideals hanging in the wind if it would be profitable for them to do.

You mention europe is enshrined with net neutrality regulations, so I'm going to assume you're dutch because that is actually the only country that has 'finalized' it. (This iteration at least)
For the Netherlands the situation is kept largely in check, at least from my perspective, by ISPs like XS4ALL which are pro-neutrality pro-privacy anti-taps and anti-intervention which is freely chosen by users all over the country. The splendid internet conditions there did not arise out of regulations, and in fact have been state of the art since soon after the dawn of the internet by virtue of the free market.
The regulations put in place some years ago do not improve any net neutrality situation, and will in the end only favor the oversight and anti-'terrorism' agenda. Unless another monopoly is granted doing away with the smaller yet highly influential pro-net-neutrality ISPs, in turn allowing for the problems described in your videos.

Neither facebook nor youtube are forcing you to use their service. If you don't want to associate yourself with them, you have that option, and then there is no recourse for ISPs continuing to block all access to the internet for some reason but to lose you as a customer. You get net neutrality by not being a peon and finding your dignity, thereby telling your ISP you don't want the shit they're peddling by threat of moving elsewhere or finding alternatives.
It is evident there's a consumer desire for action; just look at reddit's front page. But at the same time these people are fighting to implement the complete opposite of a solution to their problem: more regulations.
Look, make no mistake I also want net neutrality; an internet where data is data is the internet I want to use. But I'm not about to start appealing to government to force providers to cater to my needs when I know those efforts in restriction can only end in disaster and my own efforts are perfectly capable of attaining the goal sought.

Correct. One of the fundamental problems with a broadcast network such as the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network is that it doesn't scale well while increasing the volume. So-called O(n^2) scaling.




Correct again. This is why *actual* scaling solutions such as a caching layer as proposed by the Lightning Network; layers which reduce the amount of transactions required to be *on* the blockchain, and need to therefore move through the broadcast network in one way or another, while allowing for magnitudes (&gt;1000x) the transaction volume the blockchain is used for, are *much* more interesting than this relatively 'measly' increase of 1MB to 8MB, increasing the transaction volume from 3 tx/s to 'only' 24 that XT is proposing at much much greater cost.
Don't get me wrong, I'm in favor of a block size increase. But *not* XT's 'maximum optimism' BIP 101. It's demanding way too much capacity from nodes, much too soon, to the detriment of the network.

It's showing you what miners are actually doing, except a billion times slower.
It'll keep up with the tip of the chain and mine at 4 hashes per second. It shows each and every failed attempt, along with some indication of how 'far off' the block is from being valid (essentially, by counting the bits that are 1s and should be 0s). *If* the simulator ever finds a valid block (which it won't), then were it not for the fact that it doesn't support BIP34, that block would be valid and accepted by the entirety of the network.
Miners increase the nonce value in the headers after each hash. When the nonce runs out of values they change the timestamp, or increase an extraNonce - a value in the coinbase transaction, which changes the merkle root. Then they start all over again by increasing the nonce. Rinse repeat until a valid block is found.
You can control the incrementing/decrementing of the nonce, extranonce and timestamp with the buttons and see what happens.
See, for example, the simulator on top of the genesis block:

Other reasons than those we agree upon above.
Namely, the ability at low thresholds for independent parties to validate. That ability hinges not only on the *relatively* trivial size of the mempool (RAM) or the UTXO set (RAM &amp; storage), but *primarily* on transaction capacity (bandwidth &amp; latency), followed (at distance) by storage, RAM and CPU.
I fully expect a good portion of the network to be unable to fully validate at block sizes like 20MB+ (today). I've lived in China for a while, for example, and at those sizes I wouldn't have been able to participate, internet connectivity there being the shitpile that it is. And there are many places on this earth where connectivity is as shit as it is in China.
They would be left to trusting those that can, and that's - in my opinion - a slippery slope. Hence, I do believe there must be a limit low enough to include that portion.
For the record, if anything, I'm in favor of BIP103 + a neart-term ramp-up to 8MB.

@_date: 2015-08-31 23:33:00
It doesn't make sense to prevent that by setting a minimum block size.
If miners don't feel it's worth it to stick transactions in a block, then obviously the incentives to compensate for that effort are broken. Sufficiently high fees on the transactions should do the trick.
The fact miners are not required to stick any transactions in a block is not a bug.
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:27:55
The point of bitcoin is a decentralized money anyone can participate in without trusting anyone. That last bit means you need to be able to validate the system is working correctly *yourself* (with no dependencies on anything) by verifying that the contents of the blockchain follow the consensus rules (such as the amount of coins in circulation, or that coins haven't been spent twice). If you aren't able to validate the blockchain, then there's no point in using bitcoin over anything else. The ability to validate the system is what makes bitcoin a special thing.
Having no limit to the size of blocks means there is nothing stopping miners from making arbitrarily large blocks such that this ease of validation no longer applies. Effectively, you could end up at a point where you're *trusting* miners to play nice and honest. An introduction of trust is detrimental to Bitcoin, therefore an elimination of the limit altogether is thought to be bad.
Now, technology is continually improving, and the bitcoin userbase appears to be continually growing. So a static limit of 1MB is probably not the right value to have going forward: it's becoming easier to validate while the demand for size in blocks is increasing and supply is not. That's a meh.
So, already there's (at least) 3 variables here (ease to validate and block space demand/supply), and countless more perspectives on what those variables mean, which makes for an impossible equation to solve. This last bit makes the debate political rather than technical, which is the reason we've been experiencing the excruciatingly painful debate of the past few months, leading to terrible bias, 'sides and camps', prejudicial and wrong assumptions, poop fights and attempted censorship, heroes, villains, leaders and leavers.
So, that. Turtles all the way down.

None of the rules you still enforce and care about are broken, therefore there is no reason you are necessarily affected even if you fork off the main chain (which you certainly would in the event of a hard fork).
SPV security has much more narrow security than even a 0.1 node not validating P2SH txs would have, *if* you don't much care for P2SH. Which, apparently, you don't - seeing that you're running 0.1

The difficulty is irrelevant to the vast majority of network participants. Only miners care about it because their profits are directly affected by a change in the difficulty.
The block size limit is relevant to both miners aswell as nodes - a block size limit offers nodes a measure of certainty and predictability over whether or not they are able to realistically validate the blockchain some amount of time later. Without a limit, or an unrealistically high limit, nodes can't do this - they would be left to trusting the remainder of the network to do validation for them, which is a relation against every measure upon which Bitcoin has been created; *decentralized* peer-to-peer money; money *without* trust.

BIP 100 is losing more and more of my confidence to work (and it didn't have much to begin with) for the very reason that I don't think miners are competent enough to make an educated vote.
Other reasons are that the proposed threshold values (or anything other than 50%, really) can be trivially bypassed by any miner majority; the lack of hard limits nodes still enforce and thereby derive certainty/predictability from; added encumbrance to independent miners to enforce their preferred fee policy in regard to a now malleable limit.

Many of those who believe bitcoin can be a viable money subscribe to a school of economic thinking that suggests an economy can function using currency absent of any arbitrary owner acting or reacting on the perceived health of that economy by controlling and manipulating the supply of money.
Others believe manipulation of supply may be warranted at times, but that the ability/power for any one entity to do this is inevitably corruptible - regardless of their previous or future good intentions.
Bitcoin is an attempt to combat central control over money by removing a central entity from the system.
As for historic examples. I am not a historian.
But take the Weimar republic and their massive DMark hyper-inflation 'strategy'. This strategy successfully alleviated their obscene debt after WW I ( and restored their economy to previous standards. Unfortunately, this success was used to fuel the next war effort - but the economy had been given a massive boon regardless.
More recently. The Greek debt crisis. The Greeks can't manipulate their currency (the Euro), because they need the consent of the EU - which they are not getting. Had they been able to print money, they would have been rid of their debt in little time, and could work on restoring their stagnant economy rather than paying off with what little profits they can muster. The Euro may very well turn out to becoming a failure if the zone fails to pull Greece out of that crisis - and currency manipulation might well be an easy, but ugly, swift solution.
Then there's fractional reserve banking. In essence the total supply of money remains the same in this system, but it is possible for, essentially, multiple people to own the same money. This way, money supply is artificially higher while ownership is duplicated. This may result in a short-term boon to an economy; if different people are allowed to spend the same money then more economic activity may be present, boosting productivity, and boosting efficiency. But in the long run, this, too, needs to be repayed, which inevitably puts economic activity in a trough, which decreases productivity. The question here is: why is this system fair? And to who is it 'fairest'?
It's all a massive earth-scale experiment. Bitcoin, the Euro, the USD, the Yuan and fiat in general, gold, something else on the horizon. And I, for one, can't wait to see how it all turns out.

Individual miners contribute their mining power as part of a pool, rather than going at ot alone, in order to increase their cumulative chances of finding a block, thereby increasing the rate at which they are paid (but not increasing profits). Pools offer increased predictability and certainty over payouts.
They work something like this: pools distribute (unique) block headers of potential blocks to their contributors. These contributors don't necessarily know what is in the block (not until it is 'found' and broadcast), but they can mine the headers nonetheless. Just by increasing the nonce in the headers and fiddling with the timestamp can they 'mine' the block - without knowing anything else.
(Using protocols/pools that support getblocktemplate it's possible for users to assemble a block according to some policy set by the pool, thereby allowing them to know the contents of the block they're mining, and offering much better transparency)
They publish 'shares' to the pools to prove they have done some mining. These shares are a proof-of-work over the headers just like normal, except a substantially lower difficulty. The pool can see this way how much work each contributor has done, and determine their share of the rewards that way.
Typically, mining pools offer their users to withdraw the credit owed to them. So this is exactly like a centralised custodian.
Other times the reward is shared directly in the coinbase transaction (p2pool, Eligius, and perhaps some others)

Headers-first *currently* enables us to download blocks concurrently, because the best chain has been identified (whereas previously blocks had to be downloaded sequentially) thereby hugely decreasing overhead in the initial download, but that isn't all it's good for.
Checkpoints are primarily used to skip full verification of historic transactions (those before the checkpoint). Secondarily they are there to prevent reorganisations down to the latest checkpoint, but that is not their purpose. Because let's face it, if such a reorganisation ever occurs, bitcoin has clearly failed.
Headers-first along with some work/value determination can replace both of those functions regardless (because at any point in the chain, the amount of work performed is known, and at any point including before having all blocks some determination can be made as to the 'degree of reversibility', if you will)

There's gonna be fees, though cheaper than any in-blockchain fees.
The fees will be for the costs of 'hubs' (payment routers). Their uptime/maintenance, and the risk they take with the funds they've 'locked in' to payment channels (those private keys necessarily need to be on an internet connected machine, so not super safe for them to be running one, users unaffected though)
Further, the communication and resources required to route and confirm a payment from sender to recipient is magnitudes more efficient than an in-blockchain broadcast and confirmation we're used to. It can be made cheaper for this reason.
Also, if a hub goes offline or turns malignant, the sender must reclaim his money using an in-blockchain transaction; the blockchain is the safety net. So you need to have contingencies put in place in the case where the payment goes wrong.

Headers-first allows you to skip *full* validation (not doing script execution on txs) by replacing confidence in validation, with confidence in work - for historic blocks. We're already doing this, except today we're using checkpoints.
But yes - this changes nothing for bandwidth.
Opting out of this and doing a full validation down to genesis will become increasingly expensive - no argument here. But UTXO commitments will not help here, because there can be no UTXO commitment that gives you as much confidence in its honesty as a full validation: so far, the shortest proof the blockchain is correct, is the entire blockchain.

They don't get to 'vote' in the way you're implying.
But yes. Nodes enforce consensus rules. Through that, they vote. If you allow for the assumption that the economic majority of the network is represented through nodes, then they get to vote on which chain is given value.
Let's say miners hard fork into a 50MB block size limit, but none of the nodes (save those operated by miners) do. The miner chain would be the chain that moves forward in the sense that it will have freshly generated blocks every 10 minutes, but it would be worthless because nodes do not consider that chain in compliance with the rules they enforce.
So long as there are nodes that can validate the chain and enforce the rules do they have power, and do they get to vote.

Proofofexistence takes a document and computes a hash out of it. This hash is typically 32 or 20 bytes long, depending on the algorithm. They then store this hash in an OP_RETURN output. That's all.
This then proves the document existed in the form it was submitted, at the time it was included in a block, without storing the document itself.

1) The incentive (amounts) required to be given to miners in order to make for a secure / irreversible ledger as is intended. In what amounts transaction fees should have a role in this now or in the future, when block rewards are getting lower.
In short: How a fee market would work, and whether it's something we should be pushing to form in this relatively early stage.
2) Perhaps not really in the *business* computing ballpark, but it'd be interesting to know (or research) the effects various block size limits (eg. 8, 32 and 256MB, and the limits as proposed in BIP 100, 101 and 103) would have on the strain imposed on nodes and/or miners. And whether higher block *sizes* skew the incentives in favour of some miners depending on their size (xx% pool) or their geographical location (China).

I'm having a hard time imagining that. I don't see the difference between miners including bogus transactions paying themselves over padding with zeroes (or anything else) - other than being easier on the UTXO set or bloat. And I also don't see how we could force miners to *not* do that (pad with bogus transactions over zeroes or noise).
And even if we could somehow force miners to do this, we would only be putting already disadvantaged miners (those with poor connectivity that are more profitable at smaller sizes, generating fewer fee profits) at an even greater disadvantage. I don't see the point of a minimum blocksize.

I don't see how a block size limit increase would directly invite more users to Bitcoin.
A headline saying *"Bitcoin just increased their transaction capacity from a meagre 3 transactions per second to a staggering 60! VISA's obsolete 2500 tx/s has just been put to shame!"* doesn't impress a whole lot people I would imagine.
A headline like *"Bitcoin just increased their transaction capacity a thousand fold up to infinity through a shady new innovation called the 'lightning network', learn the 5 most important reasons you should invest in a lightning company today, number 4 will astound you!"* would.


It isn't just the GFW that's the bother. It's the general lack of networking infrastructure causing huge latencies and poor throughput that's keeping China behind. And even if they did improve conditions that specifically apply to mining (in a way it further centralizes who can mine there), then full validation is still barred for independent nodes there.


I would argue Bitcoin has already surpassed gold in terms of the *amount of transactions* that move value. Gold doesn't move very often except on paper, which could be considered as nothing but a poor centralized variety of a caching layer. It's the value/price that's different, transaction capacity; not so much.


I think the block sizes in BIP103 would sufficiently displace incentives toward fees when the block reward is less relevant, although I believe the incentives will be sufficient regardless the size - so long as the network has utility.
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:56:06
6 blocks doesn't make sure the transactions in the block aren't fraudulent if nobody is around to validate it, or everyone validating is dishonest. The 6 block thing only means it's very unlikely to be reversed.
You can put a transaction giving yourself a million bitcoins in any of those blocks; it will be completely spendable anywhere if nobody cares that it's invalid. You need to be able to validate *all the way down* in order to make absolutely sure none of these transactions exist.

Whether this is due to a somehow benevolent government granting them this privilege ie. public property through socialism, or lobbyists buying them this privilege using government power ie. effective public property through corporatism (monopolies), is beside the point. The fact remains that under these conditions they only have an incentive to create as much inefficiencies and obstructions in their affairs as they possibly can, and in so doing providing ever diminishing quality of service. My position is that any 'battle' over what these monopolies should look like through things like regulatory frameworks is just horseplay refusing to face any real problems.

OP_RETURN is meant to store cryptographic hashes or commitments of or to data. An OP_RETURN output can be up to 40 bytes long (or is it 80 now?) or it is considered non-standard, and will likely not be included in a block.
It is not meant to store the actual data.
OP_RETURN outputs don't really bloat the blockchain in and of themselves; they are provably unspendable, meaning they can safely be pruned off the UTXO set without risk of them ever appearing in a valid spending transaction's inputs. They increase the total size of the blockchain by a bit, but that isn't really considered bloat if you ask me - if used properly.


The blockchain is not a file storage system, so the biggest challenge you're facing is that the encrypted data you're pushing into it is likely too large for the transaction containing it to remain standard. I also believe the number of OP_RETURN outputs is limited to 1, so dividing the data into multiple outputs is also not an option.
Storing actual data, rather than hashes, in OP_RETURNs is discouraged through these policies.

Bitcoin Core instances attempt to connect to a wide variety of peers through various methods. Connections to peers are numerous, relatively short-lived, and continuously rotated. Similar subnets are avoided, repeated connections are avoided, and misbehaving peers are banned. On top of that, peers can manually be added or removed at the discretion of the operator.
This way, even if some rogue entity spins up double the amount of nodes that currently exist (even if in vastly different subnets) will the network be minimally affected.
Ways of improving this, or otherwise detecting a single rogue entity are being worked on I am sure, though I'm not sure what, specifically, will be the next step here. It's pretty well handled as-is. (I remember Gregory Maxwell talking about a way for external tools to connect to a trusted set of peers which will then help manage the peers Bitcoin Core connects to, for example by banning peers that are connected to 2 people that are friends - which should be unlikely)
That said, it appears node count affects some sentiment in favor (or lack thereof) of implementations (such as the recent upswing in XT nodes) - and the 'declining node count' has been a go-to argument in favor of cemtralization. Even though the validity of such claims are for a large part meaningless.

I can see BIP100 working out completely as intended. In fact I think it would. Changing the limit only when miners believe the change is warranted, and the belief is wide-spread. Sure, it would probably work.
However, that doesn't change the fact miners are now in complete control over what the limit will be (up to 2x every 3 months, that is, and ignoring the 32mb hard cap) while nodes are left dead in the water, up for the benevolent mercy of miners. That's not a situation I would want to be in as a node.
BIP100, in my opinion, surrenders the power nodes have over the block size limit to entities that *may* at some point actually have, for whatever reason, an incentive to act to their detriment.

I can handle ~50MB or so blocks for at least 2 years with no further improvements to my nodes (SSD storage will be the next bottleneck for me; I want a full index and no pruning - this is not a real problem at these sizes/costs)
200/20mbit at home, 1/1gbit on the VPS' end. Bandwidth here is cheap, uncapped and going up to 500/50mbit (home) in a year or so, so no problem there aswell.
I'm fine with a sizeable increase to the limit in the near-term. In fact my preference goes to Pieter Wuille's proposal along with a ramp-up to 8MB in the next 2 years. I think that's a very reasonable and risk-averse (assuming consensus on the hard fork) rate of increase with a 'good-enough' short-term kick.
What I'm *not* fine with, is *no* limit. No limit means I have zero certainty and zero predictability over whether or not I can run my node in a year, 2 years, 4 years. Any deterministic (BIP101, BIP103) scheme that *does* give me that is immediately superior.

Very diverse. The debate is ongoing and interesting. You should subscribe to the bitcoin-dev mailing list.
I don't know where anyone gets the idea that the 'blockstream guys' (terrible, terrible categorisation, by the way) are against a block size limit increase. They are not.
I think Luke Jr is the most conservative of the bunch, and even he considers BIP103, describing a 17% annual increase, an acceptable compromise (so far).
The discussion is more interesting and subtle than 'XT or nothing', and the reddit herd really needs to mature into it.
// to clarify: I don't think anyone is defending the 'keep 1MB forever' position anymore, if they ever were. There used to be stronger sentiment in favor of creating a more significant fee market, but this has, in the context of the block size limit, mostly been abandoned: a fee market is still very much desired, but shouldn't be created by enforcing an arbitrary, low, static and artificial limit. The conversation currently is about the trade-off between mining/validation centralisation and on-blockchain transaction capacity.

In a sense, it is: a mining majority can enforce a limit lower than that defined by consensus rules. But not higher.
The reason it is part of the consensus rule set is because the absence of a limit imposes possibly unreasonable and unpredictable cost on validators (nodes, miners) by creating arbitrarily large blocks.

The lightning network is indeed probably the best future-proof way of doing the question in OP, but seeing that it isn't ready yet the only available alternatives are payment channels as implemented in BitcoinJ - which aren't (widely or at all) supported by wallets, or centralized services such as Coinbase or Changetip.

An address is 'just' a hash derivation of the public key, which is computed out of a 256-bit randomly generated private key.
Essentially, the app on your phone will flip a coin 256 times and turn that into an address. The address 'remains' in the sense that it has really always existed as a derivation off a value in the private key space, but nobody knows about it nor does it 'exist' from the perspective of the blockchain.
You can send funds to that address just like you can send funds to any other well-formatted address the private key is potentially unknown for. Any coins you send there will be forever lost because nobody knows the key required to take ownership of those funds.

What you're describing is a legitimate threat, and it's at least partly addressed by BIP70:


*(read: SSL and certificates)*
Popular wallets support BIP70, and popular payment processors such as BitPay and Coinbase (and others) do aswell.
However, if the entire server used to process the payment (which is not necessarily the 'storefront server') is compromised... Well then anything can happen. But in many cases you'll be able to detect something is awry, such as that the entity you're sending money to is not the entity it's claiming to be (just like you can detect your internet connection to your bank, while internet banking, is insecure - the browser will tell you). Typically it'd be possible for you to prevent paying a fraudster by detecting an illegitimate transaction process.
But disregarding any of that, worst case is that you'll make a payment to fraudster, where the fraudster essentially tricked the processor into believing the fraudster's address was legitimate. In that case the fault is clearly the processor's. Through BIP70 you are given a proof of payment:


This proof proves your payment was part of a legitimate transaction with the merchant, which you would then use to resolve the dispute (legally or otherwise).
TL;DR - Using BIP70 you'll be able to have reasonably secure transactions between merchant and consumer, and you'll have more legs to stand on in case of failure (from both the merchant's as the consumer's perspective). *Not* using BIP70 or a similarly secure payment protocol (in which you fetch the address you're paying to out-of-band in some way that's secure) is vulnerable to all of what you're describing, and more.

Yeah, it's very unfortunate that he said that. I disagree strongly. In fact his own paper disagrees with that statement:


If specialized data center nodes are part of that proposal then it does rely on trust. (barring decentralized ownership which might just solve this, see more below)


I don't think some aristocratic relatively-early-adopter-only type of centralized validation scheme is viable here.
Cost is cost.


I disagree. Taking, for example, Gavin's BIP101 (which I think is better than nothing by only a very small margin, it's making far too optimistic assumptions in technological growth) will very likely make running a full node unrealistic in under 10 years (256MB), and that's getting quadratically worse for 10 years after that. Granted, that's assuming actual block sizes will approach that limit, but I think that's an assumption we must reasonably make.
If this proposal were implemented, then the emphasis will not be on running a full node in this stage or any stage hereafter. If that happens then what is even the point in Bitcoin? If I cannot validate this system is correct then why would I spend the time in using it over any other shitty approach to money.


You just said you expected the price to moon, though. If it does as you expect then no decrease in hashrate security should be observed.


The GFW (is what you mean right?) aswell as generally shitty network infrastructure in China (20% package loss wtf) is unfortunate, sure. Along with *everything* being cheaper there. Yeah, I can see that people are somewhat concerned about *geographically* centralized hashing power there. But I don't agree increasing the block size limit is the correct solution to this. In fact it implies greater block sizes can effectively prohibit Chinese miners from participating like anyone else can, which can be the very thing that *profitably* causes the spam we all so dread. This, in turn, will cause fees to rise like you yourself mentioned, leading to a more inefficient and ineffective transaction network at higher cost. I don't think anyone wins from this.
Preventing (geographically or otherwise) centralization of mining has better solutions, such as decentralized ownership, where you can provably own part of a hashing unit running inside a data center that's being run cheaply in a cost-effective location.
I think the real problem is the fact we're trying to use bitcoin as a payment network rather than a settlement network.
A caching layer such as Lightning, which allows us to substantially increase transaction capacity without affecting bandwidth requirements is a real solution to increasing userbase without negatively affecting one's ability to validate. A caching layer can easily take a few orders of magnitude more transactions at a fraction of the cost with arguably much better security, privacy and latencies. *That* is a solution. Raising the block size to the point we're forcing people to stop participating and validating is not.
^(Edit: To emphasize, I'm not in favor of doing nothing, I'm in favor of a modest increase which doesn't negatively effect anyone except those running a raspberry pi in meter cupboard)

The hostility is about XT pushing a software fork that will lead to a hard fork if a strong majority of hashing power agrees with their change, while discussion about an agreed-upon way of moving forward is far from being done discussing yet.
There's a huge palette of ways to solve the problem of the current blocksize limit being researched and discussed at this very second, but the XT people have unilaterally decided their way of going forward is the correct one, and are actively pushing and marketing their software fork unto unwitting participants of the system.
There are some major objections to their software fork, including the low threshold of agreement among miners, the ignored use of any metric whatsoever among an economic majority, the neglected counter arguments, with arguably poor retorts (if any) of well known and respected opinions and warnings of core developers and many, many other participants.
The XT software push and resulting hostility is a result of a hasty push of a very bad solution to a very important problem to which the solution has very significant repercussions which should not be decided on with haste.

[emphasis mine]
Full nodes need to validate *everything*, otherwise they're not full.
They're completely free to choose what they relay, but without validating everything they are no longer full, and live on an assumption that miners and the network is honest, which if they are not, is an easy way to fork the network.
Removing the limit results in a situation where their ability to validate everything depends on the merit of miners not to generate blocks that are beyond their ability to process. *That*, is not viable for this network, not in the way it was designed.

The block size is the size (in bytes) of blocks that miners 'discover/solve/mine' and have assembled and are being broadcast over the Bitcoin peer to peer network. The limit to blocks is currently artificially set to 1 megabyte through a consensus rule (a rule everyone in the network acknowledges and agrees upon). Blocks can therefore not exceed that limit, otherwise they are invalid.
The block size *limit* affects the amount of transactions they can contain (depending on individual transaction size, but ah), and therefore the transaction capacity of the bitcoin peer-to-peer network. Notez it only affects the transactions that are broadcast to be put onto the blockchain, and are being included by individual miners.
A (ECDSA) private key is just a preferably random number between 1 and a little less than 2^256 (a number too large to guess even if you control all computing power created by man now and in the future). By using special math you can compute a public key out of this number. You can then 'prove' you 'own' the private key that corresponds with this public key, but without exposing the private key to anyone. This is called asymmetric cryptography.
It's the same cryptography you're using to communicate with you internet bank, or facebook, or anything (https). In Bitcoin we're using it as an endpoint for money, and to prove ownership of money that has been sent to you.
Bitcoin is digitally scarce. Through a vast peer-to-peer network along with economically incentivized participants that secure it (miners) can we create a digital asset that is scarce, like gold.
Gold isn't intrinsically valuable because it is a pretty metal, it's valuable because it's hard to find and there is a - for all intents and purposes - limited in supply. Bitcoin is the same, except it is digital.

Does Eligius succesfully identify and filter out these transaction patterns? Why would other miners not use those same patches, or their own derivation thereof, to compose their own blocks? Do they all abstain from any deviation off the Bitcoin Core defaults, or do they just not care?


That's possibly an understatement. The incentives (at least for the short term, and at the current limit) are in favor of mining whatever fits. If fee-paying spam fits in the block and outbids (legitimate) competing transactions, why not include them?


This implies a great deal of altruism on their part. Had mining incentives been of the altruistic variety rather than financial one, then there would be little need to pay them. Why would we expect miners to be altruistic? It's great if they are, but a poor way to depend a decentralized network such as this on.


Not all of their job is to filter the future, it's also to solidify the past. They're doing that regardless of whether they are including everything or a subset in their blocks - if they're doing their job just for the immediate 'pay', which I believe should be considered reasonable, then including fee-paying spam seems rational.

Linux (kernel) did it in a little under 3 years before attaching the 1.0 label.
But, Bitcoin isn't your typical open-source project. Most of the changes in the above list (some of which, by the way, shouldn't be on there: infinite fractioning - impossible, automated/resuable *hard fork* process - this process should *never* be automated, though we do need to better define how to roll out such a change, lifespan expiration / loss of coins - these coins are and should be gone) are trivial to implement, or many concrete proposals or implementations doing it are already available. Thing is, deploying it often-times requires a hard or soft fork, or a massive implementation change, which takes considerable effort to analyse, peer-review, discuss, sometimes some controversy, extensive testing, etc.
We're dealing with decentralized money here; the wise approach forward is a conservative one.
Most people working in the space aren't looking to get to a 1.0 release any time soon.

If you don't want to know *how* it works, then suffice to say it's a faster, cheaper, safer and more private way to transact or accept payments.
UX can be the exact same it is today: scan some thing, hit send, done.
No waiting for confirmations either. No broadcasting to the entire network and waiting for the transaction to enter the blockchain.
It's a real payment network rather than the settlement network we're using for payments today.
It's the thing we need for bitcoin to really scale.

It would be super efficient, but then you'd be required to trust that the past was honest. This would be categorised as weak subjectivity. Various PoS proposals are weakly subjective at best, and the reason Bitcoin's PoW is superior is because it allows you to be completely objective.
But anyway, what you're trying to achieve here is less strain on validators by pruning the blockchain. This last bit is already possible: by having only the UTXO set (the list of all unspent transaction outputs) along with their location in the blockchain, you can forget about everything else. Currently this allows you to run a node with about a Gigabyte of storage data, rather than 50.
You still have to *validate* down to the beginning in order to be *as* secure of the contents of the blockchain like normal. But you can safely forget anything that's been 'fully spent'.
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:25:05
You probably didn't actually have '1' bitcoin. You probably had lots of small chunks (unspent transaction outputs, or UTXOs) which, in aggregate, amount to 1 bitcoin.
Fees are (generally) determined by taking the byte-size-amount of the transaction you're trying to get into the blockchain; taking many small chunks and sending that to one address consumes more UTXOs than taking one large chunk would, the byte-size of the transaction increases in this case, and fees are different for this reason.

The checksum doesn't have to match in order to extract the 160 bit address contained inside. The string you've given will fail the 'check' part of BASE58CHECK, but you can send coins to it all the same - assuming there's 160 bits worth of payload and a 32 bit checksum (most wallets will complain though)

A document may always be forged, but its *in*validity can be proven through, for example, a previous (signed) commitment to its original state recorded in the blockchain.
Concretely, one could create a transaction with an OP_RETURN output which contains a hash of a digital signature of the original document(s), or forgeable values therein. For this document, the public key of the signer is known to those validating the document, which will allow them to verify, beyond doubt, that - assuming this transaction is mined - a supplied document existed and was signed by its owner / signer at the time the transaction was confirmed. Would also preserve privacy of the signer.
As for coupons, replace document with coupon, and create a transaction containing a similar signature scheme for a permissioned public key which claims the coupon has been redeemed, which would invalidate the coupon.
But there's various ways to go about doing this.

Nodes continually rotate between their connected peers anyway; connections can potentially be very short-lived. They are often connected to a large amount of peers too. Whether or not a node, or many nodes, disappear and reappear every, say, hour, would not significantly impact *the network* in a way it's negative (only the disappearing specific node).
That said, it *is* better for a node to stay online for a long time; the longer you are online, the more of your peers you will have discovered, and the more broadly you will have been connected to the p2p network.
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:03:26


So maybe ask that instead.


Wow. Do kindly fuck off.
Here's the steps. Be sure to tell me if it's overly complicating the matter.
1) Compose the block
- 4 byte version with the value, 0x01
- 32 byte previous block header, 32 bytes of 0x00
- merkle root, in this case a double SHA256 hash of the only transaction in this block; the coinbase transaction
- the timestamp, 4 bytes unsigned unix, for the genesis block this was january 03 2009 19:15:05
- the bits, which is the short form of the target, which was the maximum target / minimum difficulty, which is 0x1D00FFFF
- the nonce, a 4 byte unsigned integer you increment
2) Compose the coinbase transaction
- a default coinbase transaction paying the 50 BTC initial coinbase reward to this (serialized) pubkey:
    04 67 8A FD B0 FE 55 48 27 19 67 F1 A6 71 30 B7 10 5C D6 A8 28 E0 39 09 A6 79 62 E0 EA 1F 61 DE B6 49 F6 BC 3F 4C EF 38 C4 F3 55 04 E5 1E C1 12 DE 5C 38 4D F7 BA 0B 8D 57 8A 4C 70 2B 6B F1 1D 5F
It's a standard pay-to-pubkey output
- Stick the infamous FT reference in the input's scriptSig:
The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks
Preceded by some other stuff, which appears to be the serialized bits value.
3) Do a double SHA256 over these headers while incrementing the nonce, until the nonce value is 2083236893
This will give you a block hash of:
    00 00 00 00 00 19 D6 68 9C 08 5A E1 65 83 1E 93 4F F7 63 AE 46 A2 A6 C1 72 B3 F1 B6 0A 8C E2 6F
which is lower than
    00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
4) Rejoice in your freshly and pointlessly regenerated identical genesis block.

A full node is a node that is fully validating everything on the blockchain. Every block that's coming in, every transaction being broadcast.
If you're running Bitcoin Core, you're running a full node.
8 outgoing connections and 0 incoming just means your node isn't reachable for the internet at large. It doesn't make your node 'less full', but accepting incoming connections does make you better and more broadly connected to the network.

It's akin to throwing money down the toilet.
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:26:08
By spending money to an OP_TRUE [soft-fork-enforced-conditions] script you can 'freeze' funds on the bitcoin blockchain.
The funds are frozen through miner consensus, a soft fork, which disallows spending these OP_TRUE outputs without some additional signatures or what-have-yous. If these soft-fork-enforced conditions are passed, then it'll be possible to 'unfreeze' funds on the bitcoin blockchain.
Any OP_TRUE output is (currently) immediately spendable by anyone, making this scheme backward compatible with and considered valid by all previous clients (just like P2SH, the actual serialized script and additional signatures aren't executed by pre-P2SH clients).
Money is created on the sidechain in the same way it is created by spending to a provably unspendable output, except rather than the output being unspendable, it is merely frozen through miner consensus on an OP_TRUE output.
I can't explain much more specifically than that because I don't know which conditions 'freeze' the funds, which conditions exist on the sidechain, how miners keep track of the 'pool', unfreeze, etc.
I just know this is how it'll be a backward compatible soft fork rather than a hard fork.

What we're talking about here is an automated and unsupervised dependency on first-seen policy. One could imagine a myriad of possible ways to profitably attack this scheme at no or relatively low cost. Even if nodes and miners are all actively enforcing first-seen-policies, which they are not.

The actual 21M figure is quite arbitrary, although this:
is a reasonable explanation as to why it's 21 million rather than any other number.
The reason there's a limit is to create scarcity in a digital resource. Satoshi modelled the monetary feature of the bitcoin token to resemble that of gold; it's getting increasingly difficult to find large volumes of gold, and one could say gold is a finite and scarce resource because of this. Generating large volumes of new bitcoins is similarly getting more difficult through the 4-year halving and difficulty adjustment consensus rules.
Scarcity in a resource is one of the properties that makes the resource useful as a money. Gold is scarce, and throughout history gold has been an excellent, if not the best, holder of value, with widespread use as a money to this day. Bitcoins are, again, similar in this sense. In addition to them being easier to transmit and store.

Those who choose to trust nothing can, and are unaffected either way.
People trusting stuff is either a sign of that which those people are trusting is trustworthy, or the people who are trusting that something are too eager to trust and will learn better soon enough.

Bitcoin is like every participant in the network playing an endless game of chess.
Mining is like figuring out the best possible move given the current positions on the board. Making a move requires you to prove to anyone the move is 'excellent' by providing prospective and sound future developments of the game. After having made a move you are required to reconsider any future move, which, again, takes heaps of effort.
The (consensus) rules of the game are well-known, and can be enforced by anyone observing it; you can't cheat the system by, say, moving a pawn from an arbitrary location to kill the king, because everyone would consider this an invalid move given the rules, and discard your contribution.
The current positions on the board can only have come to be through a specific path in the past which you can easily and effortlessly provide proof for, but not fabricate.
You can only change the positions on the board and the past, by providing proof of a new configuration and past moves, with the same or a higher amount of chess moves, with provably better accumulative prospects for future progression of the game.
Result: An extremely and increasingly hard-to-reverse progression of an endless game of chess for which the rules have been observed by many independent auditors of the game.

Well I agree with much if what you've said.
I'll comment though that the "free market ideologues" _usually_ try to emphasize not the importance of "muuuh free market", but of consumers, people, to communicate to this free market what to supply and what not to supply, with their feet. Specifically, they don't regard a free market as a tool that will just work under all conditions; all markets are made up of individuals choosing means to attain ends, it is the quality of the ends sought and choices made, that translate to how well the market performs.
Now as for the corporatism, intertwining capitalism with government, of course I agree there. But my entire argument is to instead of embrace effective socialism [by regulating net suppliers to the point they are effectively public property, causing them to do the worst job imaginable as socialist 'businesses' do], to combat the corporate cronies instead.
As for government and the cronies being the same people, of course I agree there too. But what they're making use of by infiltrating the government is power given to them by the people, which is why this scam works. The solution is for the people to wake up and deny government the power to rule over them, and in so doing making the cronies wield an impotent weapon, forcing them to revert to their previous way of selling goods people want, or providing services people want to pay for.
It's all very simple, but obfuscated by clever veils of misdirection to the point we have freedom loving people embrace a socialist agenda to try and get back their freedom which they had in the first place but gave away. I would be impressed if it wasn't so tragic.

You're right, business model not so much. Their business is a brokerage for the most part, so that's unaffected.
As for the processing of payment, risks are different in a lightning network.
Namely, they don't exist given proper contingencies. :) Currently they do (dependency on 0-conf and first-seen policies), and those should be included in their business model. But it shouldn't impact them hugely.

If they do it based on FSP then they'll go bust and I can't use their services anymore, for one.


As I mentioned there's plenty of alternatives we can utilize that can replace FSP completely. These alternatives are available or being worked on, lightning being the most promising - which sadly isn't ready.
If bitcoins became less useful because we need first-seen-policy for them to be useful and there are no alternatives, then they have become worth less for the right reason. Sadly so.


Be sure to let Nokia know.

To expand on the underlying message:
Many merchants and payment processors today (strongly or loosely) rely on a significant majority of individual nodes and miners enforcing first-seen-policy. First-seen-policy means only the first transaction a node or miner sees is valid, and any double spends will be discarded and not relayed. First-seen-policy works to prevent double spending and allows one to accept 0-conf payments *only if* a very strong majority in the network adopts this policy. It is a policy that *cannot* be enforced as a consensus rule and can *only* be depended upon if you trust the *current* state and honesty (and similar philosophy to your own) of the network.
If first-seen-policy were a policy that could be enforced as a consensus rule, something which can be enforced by the entirety of the network, we would not need mining to build the blockchain. It *cannot* be enforced network-wide.
This policy is a terrible policy to build a financial infrastructure on top of.
There are various proposals that allow us to move away from it, which I'll get to in a second, but the fact is that today many merchants still rely on it much too eagerly. The person in the linked conversation put his black cap on and attempted to abuse this reliance to his advantage, as you should rationally expect anyone to do. His attempts were succesful, and he has benevolently reported on his experience. It shows that what's been known for a long time can be, is, and will be actively abused. Bravo.
Various methods of moving away from our incessant dependency on first-seen policy are the following:
**Wait for confirmations** - The blockchain works as a permanent and immutable ledger only after recent entries in its ledger have been made (more and more) permanent by stacking 'work' on top of it; mining. Wait for at least one confirmation before acting on a payment, very preferably more.
**GreenAddress-like trust relations** - If some trusted party (such as a payment processor, wallet provider) signs or cosigns the payment, and you consider them a trusted relation, then that could increase your confidence in that the payment will not be double-spent.
**RBF-Scorched-Earth** - If RBF is widely adopted in the p2p network and by miners, then Scorched-Earth is a viable option to, in a very anti-social way, prevent 0-conf payments from being double-spent, by removing the incentive for a malevolent peer to double spend a payment headed for you and spending the entire output to miners in the form of fees. An attacker will lose the entirety of the payment, but so will you. It's meant to prevent by removing incentive, not to cure.
**Lightning-like networks or payments channels** - These are off-chain transactions with an existing, and potentially much earlier, settlement or fallback transaction on the blockchain. They are completely safe from double spends, but they aren't very widely adopted, or available.
TL;DR - First-seen policy is a policy we absolutely need to stop relying on if you want to stay in business. The above list outlines options we can use to move away from it.

Mining follows a [poisson distribution]( and will *tend* toward 10 minutes; the network retargets the time it takes to solve a block to 10 minutes every 2 weeks. As hashing power changes over time, the time it takes to solve a block on average will deviate from the targetted average.
You can calculate the above distribution, although this will not perfectly align with what's happened in practice, because hashing power continually changes.

Whenever I hear those guys talk, something's off.
Gavin always seems intentionally insecure of what he's saying. Then you dig down deeper and you'll find what he says he'll repeat over and over again in a way it sounds appealing, but it actually means very little. The contents of his words are nil. Maybe that's because he knows nil, and has nil vision.
Mike, on the other hand, talks boldly, confidently and aggressively. If you know the background story of a topic he's discussing well, you'll find many hidden references to what opposing views to his have said in a way you'll think of the opposition negatively, knowingly or not. His way with words calms you because he'll make it appear as though he can see the future and knows the outcome of anything. But he doesn't. If you've taken a position in a debate opposing to his, you'll of course disagree with his arguments, but you'll have no way to retort because he'll counter with an impasse. He'll bring along Satoshi's words as a guardian, or refer to past arguments totally unrelated to the current, or handwave it away as though it's irrelevant. He is a politician, and he is driving views not backed by Vulcan logic apart.
Now, arguably, there's a shitton of Vulcan logic in this community. Maybe up to 5% or so, which is way above average. But still far from enough to deter the wild ideas the likes of Mike can bring forth into existence. That guy needs to calm the hell down and take a back seat.

It's a change address which belongs to you.
Every time you spend bitcoin you must 'consume' an 'output' which you have ownership over. You must consume this output fully, meaning you split the amount it holds over the address you're sending it to, and a change address which belongs to yourself.

Such high deviations from market prices are never a good sign.
MtGox traded bitcoins at about $100 dollars *higher* than competing exchanges did in the months before it went down, because their USD withdrawals (and later also the BTC withdrawals) had been disabled.
A healthy exchange should always have its exchanged asset's prices hover around the market value due to arbitrage. A strongly deviating price (one which cannot be explained by a difference in fees and such) indicates the asset isn't properly arbitraged, indicating there's a problem.

Ideally, if the fee from B to C covers both transactions, it will be mined.

Quantum computing will make brute forcing ECDSA pubkeys down to private keys practical. All pay-to-pubkey transaction outputs could be stolen (if not made unspendable through a soft fork, which would be bad in another way). Most transactions today are either pay-to-pubkey-hash or pay-to-script-hash, both of which are protected by hashing algorithms (SHA256 and RIPE-MD) which are harder to crack.
Quantum computing reduces the searchable keyspace of the latter algorithms to 2^128 (through Grover's algorithm) which is still a ridiculous number of hashes to perform; much much less than the current 2^256 but still impractical.
We'd have to move away from all of these algorithms regardless, and move to quantum proof algorithms.
Mining is unaffected.

There is no 'need' for these transactions to be cheaper causing someone with interest in LN succeeding to artificially make 'legacy' transactions more expensive; they *just are* due to being so much more efficient. *That* is the fact.
Further, there's a mountain of other, much more significant, benefits to LN relating to privacy and security we can actually use to build a financial infrastructure that currently does not exist on top of the bitcoin blockchain.

I once calculated that at a price of USD 300,000 in the next 6 years would make mining profitable until it consumed 8% of the world's power production. Error margin of about an order of magnitude, massive amount of assumptions in that calculation, but still impressive.
The conclusion was that such a price will not be possible for at least 15 years.

Running a node and donating a kidney are orthogonal, though.
- Donating a kidney does not give you unique benefits you otherwise cannot have, save losing some weight. They are purely for the benefit of others.
- The value of a kidney is unquestioned regardless of the incentive used to fetch it. Running a node is not (arguable, this is my opinion).
I'm all for monetizing kidney donation, sure, but monetizing node operation - not so much.

Depends on what the 51% is doing. If it's orphaning off blocks of the other 49% in favor of their own, then yes, we can see this happening. If they are playing along with the rules and behave as is expected of any miner, then no, they can completely obscure their existence.


Everyone running a Bitcoin Core instance / full node is verifying every single number and transaction passing through the network aswell as everything that exists in the blockchain down to the genesis block. This is why bitcoin is such a robust network; many independent auditors of the agreed-upon history of the ledger.

... more centralized?
Mayhaps, in a severely one sided and short sighted version of events. On the other hand, one could argue GPUs, FPGAs and eventually ASICs decentralized the network further by making botnets non-viable to be mining with. So there's that.
But. Proof-of-work mining as it exists today will always tend to be done by those entities who can do it more efficiently than others. If large entities with a data center can do it with less effort and at lower cost than I can with a laptop, then quite obviously they take a larger share and I get run out of the market. Indeed, PoW has a tendency to, at the very least geographically, centralize. If this was not satoshi's vision, then *that* vision was wrong.
Having a low-value cryptocurrency system which is widely and evenly distributed over many independent peers each doing an equal share of the work certainly sounds absolutely fantastic. It's also an absolute fantasy. I would quite surely buy out the market the very next day, pump, dump and laugh all the way to the bank. And if not me, the next guy. Again, this is exactly what happened, and will continue to happen as we settle in higher and higher levels of perceived market value that are more mature and more resistant to such tomfoolery.

I wrongly thought any coinbase reward other than the computed block reward + aggregate of fees, including anything lower, would make a block invalid.
Specifically, I though the aggregate of inputs's referenced outpoint amounts minus the aggregate of output amounts would have to be exactly equal to the block reward, which given the code the above pull request changed would apparently again have been 50 in ~135 odd years.
I wasn't aware an amount lower than that would also make for a valid block.
If it wasn't, it'd have technically been a hard fork change.

Which is only possible if nodes completely ignore the blocksize, making the cost imposed upon them in the future completely uncertain.
Removing certainty from the cost that nodes know and can predict and are required for them to keep on validating is a terribly dangerous precedent that can very possibly lead to centralization of validation into miners, defeating any point in bitcoin.
So long as nodes have the certainty of knowing what their validation efforts will cost them, they have power. Remove it and that power goes with it, yielding it to others - in this case miners.

Transactions that have been fully spent (meaning, all of a transaction's outputs have been consumed in one or more spending transaction' inputs) are no longer relevant to the network; they can never be referenced from a valid transaction, and, once verified, may be safely forgotten.
By forgetting all fully-spent transactions you will effectively shrink the blockchain to well under (currently) a GB.
All you will be left with is the unspent transaction set, and their location in the blockchain (merkle branches), and (currently) enough recent blocks to handle reorganisations.
What's required, though, is that you have fully verified everything at least once, meaning you will have to download the full blockchain. But you can safely forget certain parts of it as you go.

Existing exchanges would most likely follow a single fork because none of them have contingencies in place to follow multiple; it isn't even possible because a hard fork split is entirely incompatible with one another. It would be an exchange that trades dollars with some thing, but also accepts euro's, and somehow treats them like dollars. Doesn't make sense.
So exchanges are gonna follow a single 'fork'; the one they think has merit of being the one that survives (or yields them maximum profit).
But .. If both forks last for any reasonable amount of time (meaning: both will have at least some activity and hashing power to still function), which I think is unlikely. Then I think it's fair to predict exchanges popping up out of the woodwork that allow trading between the two (or existing exchanges doing that, like Cryptsy and altcoin exchanges like that). Same happened with MtGox when it was going under.

I don't see banks adopting bitcoin (save research) so long as people haven't; why would they?
If they want an inter-bank settlement mechanism, then they might aswell create a permissioned shared private ledger loosely (or not at all) based on a blockchain design, which would be magnitudes more efficient and they would have complete control over. It's a far better alternative than bitcoin will ever be for this use case. Bitcoin is for the people. When the people adopt bitcoin, banks may/will follow, but I don't see them busting that move any sooner.


I don't see Bitcoin as some static thing that will never move out of its current form, already we've seen P2SH, HD wallets, all the other BIPS. Sidechains, the lightning network and heaps of other innovations are actively being developed - we're moving forward miles at a time.

If a 0-fee transaction isn't getting confirmed, it will really have never left your ownership; they remain yours until the the transaction confirms. So you can't lose funds this way, nor can they go to a recipient you didn't formerly intend to send it to.
Worst case, the transaction will get 'stuck'; miners won't mine it, and a transaction *with* a fee spending the same inputs will not be relayed by peers because they'll see it as a double spend and discard it.
Getting unstuck can be solved by time, RBF (replace-by-fee), first-seen-safe-RBF, CPFP (child-pays-for-parent). RBF (or variations thereof) and CPFP are not currently widely adopted in the peer-to-peer network.

Bitcoin *is* a settlement system.

I'm sorry but did you read the post?
The fact there's a cost to running a node is unquestioned. I argue the benefits of running one outweigh the costs to those people who see value in them, and that these benefits are enough an incentive for nodes to exist.
If you don't see value in the benefits, then there is no reason for *you* to run one. Instead you will, at best, degrade to SPV security and live on the trusted assumption that mining is honest. That's fine.

They validate everything in the blockchain and everything going over the wire on the network without trusting anyone or anything. They enforce consensus rules. They decentralize the network by independently auditing and managing its contents, health and activity. Nodes are the reason bitcoin still exists and can be depended upon without permission and without trust.


Miners (solo miners and pools) must be running a node, a node therefore doesn't do anything special a miner doesn't do.


There's nobody explicitly paying you to do run a node, but there is a very strong financial incentive to be running a node.
Namely, if you're not running a node then you are not able to check the validity of any transaction you are presented *without* trusting someone. If someone sends you money, the *only* way to know for a *fact* the transaction paying you exists is by running a node.


Nodes process transactions (and by extension, miners do too).
Miners add them to the blockchain by mining.
Mining is the paid incentive, processing/validating transactions is not.
Actual transaction validation/processing is done by every participant.

Every public key shares an address with about 2^96 other public keys.
There's (a little less than) 2^256 private keys, so 2^256 public keys. To make an address you hash the public key, first with SHA256 (giving you another 256 bit number), then with RIPEMD160, giving you a 160 bit number. So logically, there's 2^96 collisions for any public key.
The network doesn't prevent this because there's no way to prove this. Probabilities *do* prevent this, because both 2^160 and 2^256 are numbers that are *far too large* to *ever* legitimately cause someone to generate a collision.

Agreed. Long term, Bitcoin the way it is now (on-chain pseudonymous transactions) isn't suitable to be used in physical stores anyway, as they all require confidence in instant payments, which it cannot provide.


Possibly. It doesn't *totally* destroy your privacy, but you're right, it can, if abused terribly. Also, CA companies can currently push capital controls on your funds or steal from you without your consent. Not so for this scheme.


I don't like SE because of it's terribly anti-social nature. But it's convolutedness can easily be covered by payment processors, *just like payment processors currently also 'guarantee' instant confirmations on top of first-seen through the gathering of exceptionally questionable network topology metrics or even mining contracts*, which is magnitudes worse.


Current developments indicate an onion-routing-like scheme, which preserves privacy. But yes, this is completely open to implementation.


Because first-seen is an unsustainable policy for a decentralized network for which it is *irresponsible to build a payment network on top of*.


I know this argument sounds well in theory, I, too, have used it many times before to great effect. I regret doing so because it is completely flawed.
The dependency on the merit of miners (and the p2p network) is too great, without an infrastructure supporting at least RBF(-SE) to back it up, it is an unsustainable risk management strategy and eventually can only hurt users. On top of that it can hugely fragment the network causing unpredictable illegitimate reorganisations leaving some miners out to dry for 'doing it proper' and causing other miners to profit *from exhibiting undesired behavior*.

An infinite amount of bitcoin, or dollars. 'Never' is a rather indefinite term in this case.
Anyway, this is very hard to calculate, fees are free-floating values determined by the policies miners set up individually based on their perceived cost/charge to admitting a transaction in their block.
The general idea is that so long as blocks are consistently being saturated (huge demand, not enough supply in terms of block size space to meet it) fees/prices will rise - just like any market under the same supply/demand conditions.
By this logic, the price to doing this is ever-increasing so long as blocks are saturated while miners rejoice in profits.

ShapeShift isn't a physical store, you can double-spend from the comfort of your couch.

I went through the trouble of looking up the post referred to earlier:




That discouragement, and in fact the entire post, is completely misleading and wrong.
Allow me to add some nuance:
If you *trust* the bitcoin network is operating as it should *and* you can't or don't make use of the functions a node offers you, then there's little point in you running one. But do, if you want to.
If you want to verify and monitor *for yourself* that the network is running as intended, *or* you make use of the functions a node offers, then by all means, run a node.
But know this: Under no circumstance should anyone be discouraged from running a node because they are supposedly hurting the network. Bitcoin is a network and a system which requires no permission from anyone to participate. If some teenager on his dad's computer can 'hurt' the network by spinning up Bitcoin Core every now and again, then this is not a network worth being a part of. But it is. The network is extremely robust to begin with, and it's better that anything that can or supposedly will hurt it be discovered and solved, rather than avoided through discouragement of participation.

How would miners be able to filter spam, though?
If the backlog consisting of what's supposedly spam transactions appear like legitimate fee-paying transactions, then how would one categorize a spam transaction as spam, and a legitimate transaction that looks the exact same as legitimate?
As for keeping the block size reasonable regardless of a backlog; why would a miner not include all it can muster into their block if the miner deems the fee appropriate and the additional cost/risk to broadcasting the resulting larger block acceptable?

Every participant would reject any block higher than 1MB. The block size limit is a consensus rule, anything that happens that is not encompassed within the consensus rules is rejected by the network.
Changing the limit to some higher amount requires a change in these consensus rules, and a change in the consensus rules requires the entirety of the network to agree in order not to fragment.

blockchain.info is notorious for offering the ability to pay no fee by - almost - default. They are the reason many such transaction get 'stuck', and it's a terrible inconvenience for everyone.
Don't send a transaction without a fee unless you are prepared to wait a long while or chase after it to try and rebroadcast the thing (often to no effect). By extension, although this is of course your preference and choice; don't use blockchain.info.
It's up to miners to admit your transaction - absent of fee - in a block they are mining, a transaction for which they are not getting paid and have zero to negligible incentive to even consider. Hours. Days. More.
Few if any miners mine these transactions, and now that blocks are filling up (up to the soft limit of 750kb), they're gonna be pushed down the queue, in which fee-paying transactions take precedence, further and further.

Getting out of this would, I think, be similar to the way we got out of CVE-2010-5139:
It'd have required at least a majority of miners to update ASAP, immediately enforcing BIP66, foregoing the process of 'rolling' it in through voting as usual, and forking the chain (though not a hard fork).
Similar to the above CVE, it would have been solved only after the 'good' chain overtakes the 'bad' chain (which includes the non-standard bad BER signature).

edit: question was: "what's the difference between a hard fork and a soft fork, in relation to a sidechain" or something to that effect.
A hard fork is an event which requires all participants to agree on a change. Miners, fully validating nodes, merchants, exchanges, payment processors, etc.
A soft fork is an event which requires only those who contribute hashing power (miners) to agree on a change.
A soft fork change *restricts* existing consensus rules enforced by everyone further. A hard fork change *expands* existing consensus rules enforced by everyone, or introduces completely new rules.
A restriction can be done by miners alone because they are the ones expanding the ledger and a majority is enough to enforce such a change (although typically a supermajority of ~95% is sought). An expansion must be done by everyone, because old clients who disagree with or don't know about new rules cannot and will not enforce them, causing a fork.
Sidechains are different from a hard fork because existing users, clients, nodes, etc. can be completely oblivious to them and live under the existing rules perfectly fine. Sidechains can be implemented by miners enforcing a soft fork which introduces them.
Permissioned sidechains (which isn't quite decentralized) such as the Alpha sidechain can be created today, as they have on the testnet, but it introduces trust in those who permission the sidechain. (which in this case is fine because it's more like a proof-of-concept and invitation to start experimenting on the testnet, which has valueless currency).

Theoretically, though, you can run a wallet on a pruning node. I suppose it's mostly a UX issue (not being able to import while pruning may be confusing) to solve before it can be re-enabled.
If a node is pruning, -rescan would have to be equivalent to -reindex, which would download (if not present) and verify the entire chain anew.

I'd like to comment on this retort, which I don't agree with.
If there were no benefit to validating blocks, by running a node, then that statement would be entirely correct. But there are. There are huge benefits you otherwise cannot enjoy.
Just because there is no financial incentive you can directly profit from doesn't mean there are none. The primary incentive to running a node is the ability *to participate in this little network of ours while being completely absent of any trust in anything whatsoever*.
*Yes*, this will cost you computational resources, *yes*, you are not given money to be doing this, *no*, this does not mean the network will fail.
**Nodes do not need a financial incentive to exist**
I'd like to take the argument further, and say that a financial incentive for running a node may actually be *harmful* to the network; the reason to refrain from trusting anything should be clear to anyone running a node, indeed they are running a node because of it. Enter financial incentives, and the reason to run a node shifts, it shifts toward directly profiting from apparent contribution to the network, and not so much from taking advantage of the significant benefits a node gives you.
If people aren't running nodes while there is no financial incentive to do it, it either means nodes *no longer offer the benefits they do today* - which is hard to image - and would, only then, mean the bitcoin experiment has failed, or there is *some other, better, way to enjoy the benefits a node gives* you (zero trust) - which is also hard to imagine, but not at all a problem - this would actually be good news.
TL;DR - Without a better alternative to running a node giving you the same benefits, there will always be nodes.

Although I must correct myself in saying that upgraded nodes *will* cry wolf for invalid P2SH txs:
But nodes that have not upgraded will seamlessly go along with miners ceasing P2SH enforcement.


True, yes. They degrade to SPV security only regarding this narrowing of the rules, not any other rule they observe and enforce.


If nodes remain unupgraded, yep. But only for transactions for which these new rules apply.


Absolutely. As it stands today, utility of sidechains is paired with decreased security on the main chain for full nodes that do not *or cannot* track a sidechain.

It wouldn't really make a difference. If the block size limit is 20MB then you need to rationally expect block sizes to be this size, and your node needs to be able to handle that. Not having that expectation is setting yourself up to a failing node when sizes *do* reach that limit.

As a (solo-)miner you add transactions to the block you're mining, as you're mining, depending on your policies; whether or not the fee is satisfactory, the transaction is standard, valid, the block is full, etc.
You'd add the (validated) transactions coming in to the end of the tx list and recompute the merkle root (for which you only have to compute the right-most branch of the tree, which is the depth of tree (sqrt(n)) times a double SHA256 hash, where n is the number of transactions)
For pool-mining you are either given some block headers for which you increase the nonce (and timestamp) until it is saturated, submitting shares for them, and continually getting new block headers. You are completely unaware of the contents of the block you are mining, you're just hashing headers.
Or you're mining through getblocktemplate, which allows you to create the block and be fully aware of its contents, applying a policy set forth by the pool you are a part of.
All-in-all, assembling the block requires very very very little work compared to hashing its headers. You essentially only need to recompute a merkle branch to add a transaction, which is a function that scales wonderfully and requires exponentially less operations while the block grows linearly.
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:17:06
If 51% of miners orphan blocks not theirs then this is trivially detected through occurrences of 'weird' reorganisations of uncontested blocks at the tip, or the absence of well known miners' contributions to the chain, or the absence of your own honest blocks in the chain.
Even deviations of the time at which blocks appear to be found in what should be a poisson distribution can indicate something fishy is happening.

They can't. Or at least, they don't have to.
If a majority of miners would stop enforcing the P2SH soft fork, then knowing the serialized scripts (and not the signatures) of a P2SH output would be enough to spend the output.
A P2SH script looks like:
    OP_HASH160 [20 bytes] OP_EQUAL
It can, through original script interpretation rules, be spent with a single OP_PUSHDATA of some data (the serialized script) which hashes to the 20 bytes in the output. No signatures needed.
Only through a miner-enforced soft fork are additional conditions added to these outputs: The serialized script which hashes to the 20 bytes in the scriptPubKey is interpreted as another scriptPubKey, and the remainder of the scriptSig as another scriptSig. Only if this 'embedded' script executes correctly and returns TRUE without failures can the output be spent.
Miners enforce this, not nodes.
In this case (P2SH), nodes *can* enforce it without further infrastructure (and I believe full nodes in Bitcoin Core also execute the embedded serialized script, although they discard/ignore the result), but if a majority of miners would suddenly stop enforcing P2SH, not a single node would fork, because in their mind the consensus rules have not been broken.
Similarly, nodes can be oblivious to sidechains because a miner-enforced soft-fork changes not a single rule in a way nodes would care: the additional conditions stuck upon an unspent sidechain-relevant transaction output are completely backward compatible and do not require the consent of everyone in the network, everyone in the network doesn't have to observe the rule because the new rule fits in the existing ones.

Bitcoin(d)/(-cli) used to be able to generate (generate=1 in .conf) but this functionality (aswell as API calls such as get/setgenerate) has been removed.
Bitcoin Core currently no longer includes a miner.
But, you can use getblocktemplate and stick that into a dedicated mining application such as BFGMiner or CGminer, although I don't know how, specifically, to do that.
Simplest way to do it is to join a pool. Although I doubt you can even get a CPU to mine a single share.
Check out this here simulator to see CPU JavaScript mining at a staggering 4 hashes per second, which roughly gives you the same odds of doing it on a maxed out CPU (so about 0):

To be honest I'm not sure what to make of it.
The one thing it has shown is that right now it's relatively cheap to create a backlog in the first place.
The cost/barrier to attacking the network by creating a backlog of otherwise fully legitimate transactions, assuming that's something we don't want, can be increased by both 'charging' higher fees, aswell as allowing for bigger blocks. 
So if anything, the 'stress' tests show both 'popular' paths forward (no bigger blocks in the short term, creating a fee market - or bigger blocks ASAP, continued cheap transactions at greater cost to validate), as far as solving a 'spam/backlog attack' goes, appear to be entirely intact.
Personally, I've now settled on being neutral in the blocksize limit debate. Although I'm starting to grow a disliking toward anyone heralding disaster.
I know my nodes can easily handle block sizes of at least 50MB in the coming years, and I'm very skeptical about any catastrophical 'UTXO cliff' or 'capacity cap' hitting us out of the blue in at least the near-term. Not until blocks are nearing to be consistently full, potentially causing user distress, would I strongly advocate to start thinking about an increase.
I'm fine either way.

I often use a PI to test an application or product specifically because its hardware is shitty; bottlenecks for an application are easily exposed this way, and if it runs on a PI, it'll run on anything.

A larger amount of data takes longer to sign, I reckon. While the difference is less than negligible, it might have been taken into account (and I don't think it has). Also, because pay-to-pubkey was the default when the system was designed, which is more data to sign to begin with, I'm pretty sure this has nothing to do with the actual reason. Just a thought ;)

As a node in LN, you're representative of one 'hop' in a transaction. Presumably you could know who you have channels open with, and you know what channels to route through, but you know nothing about the meaning of the transaction. Including its origin or destination. (Unlike Bitcoin)


Yes, you can refuse to relay anything you want, but there is no basis for such a refusal given that privacy is preserved.


The reduction of capital in one channel is made up for in appreciation in another (when merely routing), or the purchase of some thing. You're never borrowing another's capital, it's still bearer assets we're working with.

BIP38 uses AES256, which is the same encryption for HTTPS/SSL/TLS, it's secure.
As for implementations of BIP38 not being around in x years; BIP38 and all of its cryptography is well-known, well-documented and widely used. Even if there's no implementations around (which is extremely far-fetched, most of them being open-source and all), you can recreate an implementation from documentation alone.


This all depends on your password. If it's just a single well-known word in the english dictionary, no. If it's a set of words or gibberish with entropy approaching or over 256 bits, yes.


Entropy of this passphrase is about 1.97 * 10^63, entropy of 256 bits is 1.15 * 10^77 (more than this is pointless) -- Could be better, it's fine though. Assuming it isn't a well-known passphrase.


Don't use a brain wallet unless you know exactly what you're doing. Using a brain wallet the wrong way is an easy way to lose money.


Unless the pendrive is compromised and no external potentially malicious peripherals are connected to the device, it's fine. If you're going for broke, it's better to air-gap the thing permanently - no connection to anything for that device ever again, including reuse of the pendrive.


There's signed SHA256 sums provided with every release, to ensure the distribution hasn't been tampered with *during transit*, you can verify if those match and are legitimate:
Signed by core dev Wladimir J van der Laan:
Announced here:
You can also compile from source yourself, but do make sure the repo matches.


Review the code.
As for the security of your BIP38 passphrase; it's all irrelevant if the private key it's protecting is a worthless brainwallet made out of less entropy than the passphrase. First make absolutely sure the private key is correct, then make sure the passphrase on top of that is.
You may want to look into BIP39 and HD addresses, they make securing, storing and using bitcoin easier than ever. You can employ all of the security given by BIP38 without going through all the inconvenience of generating new keys for new addresses.
Also make sure to test recovery on testnet or with little/no money.

Please elaborate if you please.
Perhaps you're confusing pruning with headers-first? Which can employ an (arguably safer than the current checkpointing) assumption that allows a node to skip full (tx) verification of blocks that have a (configurable) amount of work on top of them. This assumption means you are required to trust that the network has been honest in the (distant) past, but is completely configurable and, if the user so desires, need not be employed at all.

Source: I'm a very sporadic customer to some of these shops (well, mostly bars, really)


Last (small) meetup I went to, there were about ... 20 'bitcoiners', maybe? A year earlier - at a bigger one, I think there were about 50, I think, many of which newcomers, some of which stuck.


The places I go to still accept it (notably: 4 of my favorite bars and the gas station)
I think there's more involvement with the community than an independent shop owner just starting to accept Bitcoin willy-nilly would have.


The payments service offered is free, and all it takes to accept Bitcoin is an old mobile phone or tablet. That, and the people rolling out this service are really nice and persuasive people. ;)
Having talked to various shop owners that accept it, they say there's really no downside, there's zero barrier to entry (because the people providing it do all the legwork), and there even seems to be some genuine interest in this weird internet money.
Sentiment such as:
"Well, why not? It's kinda fun."
"I used to be very skeptical when all the other shops started accepting it, then this guy [founder of the service] barged through the door and convinced me."
"I really f*cking hate paying banks too much for too little"
"I like tech."
"Gotta stay competitive.."


There's two in the city centre that I know of (within 5 minutes walking distance of anything), though I'm not sure if a great many people use them. With traditional payment services being as they are (iDEAL), it's perfectly possible to have Bitcoin on your wallet within 2 minutes, using only your phone and a debit card, through a myriad of brokers. Though I'm uncertain of the amount of users that desire better privacy and would use an ATM.
Having said all that, I don't like spending mah Bitcoin all that much. When I do, it's because "magic internet money" rather than convenience or a strong desire to get rid of them like Euro's.

Correct, which is why the ideal solution here is a soft fork rule addition (similar to BIP34 in concept) that prohibits this behaviour. Peter Todd proposed one such solution not too long ago.
It will be an interesting soft fork to deploy, too, considering it eliminates an edge much of the hashrate takes advantage of over the 'well behaved' hashrate. This might be a soft fork that cannot be rolled out using miner voting; much of the hashrate would rationally not vote in favour of enforcing it.

Nodes can enter and exit the p2p network at any time, they will resync with the rest of the network and fully validate everything that's happened in the meantime when they come back online.
On a decent machine running a fully synced node they will validate every transaction and every block coming in. Validating signatures is the most CPU-intensive and power-consuming function they perform, but at current transaction rates this can easily be considered a background-process; a fully validating, fully synced, node will not consume much more energy than an idle machine will.

A linearly increasing block size leads to quadratic IBD sync time.
A static block size leads to linear IBD sync time, which is bad enough.
We can't willy nilly 'scale' Bitcoin by changing a number for this exact reason.
This is simple fundamental fact for any block chain unless you're willing to erode your security assumptions (ie. by making the assumption long-past PoW is 'good enough', and skipping validation)


Take a peek at, say, Pieter Wuille's impressive track record of contributions to Core - most of them have been related to solving or mitigating these problems. They've been working on this since the start. If they hadn't then the network wouldn't even function on 1MB blocks; their efforts into improving scalability make the entire block size debate possible in the first place (and they're getting the stink eye for it! :S).

Because an adversarial/attacking miner *can* cause a fork to occur, by intentionally mining non-standard transactions that are invalid by the new rules, and tricking non-upgraded nodes to accept a now-invalid block.
Having 95% of (supposedly) honest miners enforcing the soft fork ensures any such forks are quickly reorganised out of the chain (from the perspective of old nodes, upgraded nodes are entirely unaffected).

What's forcing them?

Actually hydro/green energy appears to be the cheapest, at least for now.
Much of the hashrate is concentrated in China because private far-off hydro plants produce way too much electricity for a very small and local population that isn't connected to the state grid, and can supply it at insanely cheap rates.
I fully expect most, if not all, (profitable) mining operations in the future to be entirely green, drawing electricity mainly from hydro plants (typically located in cool environments, making cooling even cheaper). Solar requires a ton of sun, which is shitty because the sun is hot. Land-based wind energy is unreliable, though perhaps some operations might take advantage of reliable sea-based wind farms.
Nuclear's stringent regulation makes it prohibitively expensive in comparison (at least for now).

You can't attach proofs to a block after it's been made without invalidating it, and any flags you pass on while propagating are trivially replaced by anyone who doesn't observe the 'rules', also any known identity attached to a node or message implies an entity permissioning that identity with some special privilege, which contradicts what bitcoin stands for so far and will tend toward centralization.
Economically incentivizing nodes is great and all, but to be honest I don't believe nodes need such an incentive to be run by independent participants; running a node offers significant benefits to the operator they otherwise do not get: The simplest proof that you can get that the blockchain contains valid data, and the network performs how it is intended, is to be running a full node. I believe this incentive alone is sufficient for a large enough amount of independently operated nodes to audit and observe the blockchain and the network.
If the reasoning to fund nodes is to improve block propagation times between miners, then I can tell you this, for a large part, has already been solved by the High Speed Relay Network, which is a separate peering network that greatly reduces the amount of time needed for blocks to reach all miners that use it.

Future contracts pertain to the future purchase of an asset at a price negotiated today.
OP_CSV doesn't quite work exactly like that, but it could, for example, allow parties to negotiate the future disclosure of a secret given some precedent (that precedent being the inclusion of contract outcome in the blockchain). That secret could, then, be anything.
Lightning leverages OP_CSV to 'trigger' this 'future' contract given the precedent of an involuntary closing of a Lightning channel - forcing the closing party to wait for the negotiated period, and allowing the counterparty to receive/retrieve promised funds within that period.

segwit should be implemented as soon as possible but has nothing to do with blocksize limit.

Segwit allows a block size limit increase as part of a soft fork. While it could be considered 'a bonus' to the other features it offers, it absolutely has *something* to do with the block size limit.


This isn't realistic if you want full objectivity unfortunately, there's a trade-off.

10% of their blocks are empty because they are doing validationless mining; working on top of headers (well, the prevblock one) they are getting from other miners by subscribing to their pool.
These headers arrive in advance of the full block, and they can work on top of them before having fetched or validated it, by mining an empty block on the assumption the previous block is valid (which in the case of the July '15 chainfork, it wasn't)
It reduces their orphan rate, which is why they're doing it. It does not help the network, in that it unnecessarily inflates difficulty while not increasing transactional throughout. If everyone does it, there'd be a ~10% reduction in network capacity given the data in the OP.

Continual validation effort is O(n) for an individual node, doubling the block size limit / throughput (n) doesn't change the scalability metric to O(2n); instead doubles the size of n, and therefore doubles complexity - the *way* it scales is unaffected. There are no constants in big-o notation (so, O(2n) doesn't exist).
Network-wide validation effort is O(n^2)
All of the other ones are relevant factors when talking about capacity.

Bitcoin moves the responsibility of owning money to *you*, the owner, rather than a third party you need to trust. If you don't want that and you have alternatives, then there is little reason for you to use Bitcoin in the first place.
That said, it's far easier than you think. Look into wallets like GreenAddress (cosigned), Trezor (hardware), or Mycelium (phone) - all of which are HD wallets that can be fully restored using a ~20 word backup seed you store once safely and then forget forever.

I'm not too sure about that, to be honest.
Some observations:
Subscript Size - A standard pay-to-pubkey-hash PubKeySig is only 25 bytes (4 operations, 20 data push bytes, 1 data push operation), rather than 36 (tx hash + output idx). But a a pay-to-pubkey PubKeySig (both compressed and uncompressed) is &gt;= 36 bytes (36 and 68 or so, respectively), so I don't think this is the actual reasoning.
Semantics (?) - You're signing to prove you are allowed to spend a set of conditions, not a specific output for a specific transaction. It does somehow make more sense to me to sign the conditions rather than the outpoint 'location'.
But I don't know the actual reason. Curious to know :)

They can't not validate and hope to produce a valid block - SPV-mined blocks are empty for the same reason. Anyway, the job of validating is not theirs; it's the economy's / auditor's. Their job is to not lose money.


Their mining an empty block is a completely legitimate practice were it not for the fact they are doing it to save time validating. If you don't want miners to mine an empty block: pay a competitive fee.

It works like
    witnesses*0.25 + block_size &lt;= 1MB
So, really, it all depends on the type of transactions we're using. There's a range of tps's that we can end up with, just like today.
(remember how the tps used to be advertised as 7, rather than 3? Well that was because in the early days we only used ~150 byte super-simple transactions, whereas today a whole chunk of them are more-complicated ~400-500 byte transactions, with many more signatures (in P2SH/multisig), and/or more inputs/outputs.)

The hashrate can only be measured indirectly through the discovery of valid blocks. This discovery process amounts to a Poisson distribution, that is, there is some probability of an event (valid block discovery) in any given time period, rather than a set interval wherein a block *will* be discovered.
For this reason, you can only arrive at some reliable (hashrate) metric after having observed a great many events.
This chart, for example, displays a hashrate metric at various sample sizes:
You'll note the (504) line is very erratic. This isn't necessarily because mining equipment is continually turning on and off or what not - it's because the measurement is inherently inaccurate due to its small sample size and its attempt at measuring a Poisson process, a process that involves probability. The (2016) line is much clearer and less erratic - though there's still, unavoidably, noise in there.
When miners plug in their hashrate, it will keep running 24/7 until it is obsolete, broken or replaced - it is 'applied' to the network constantly.

The solution is not to 'do it right', because according to the rules of the game, this *is* right. What actually solves this is:

Increasing the block size *limit* will allow for more (or bigger) transactions in a block, which allows for a higher transaction throughput over the bitcoin network.
Resulting higher block sizes will also increase the strain imposed on independent auditors of the network, full nodes, aswell as affect miners' ability to succesfully broadcast larger blocks to their competitors, or change the incentive mechanism in possibly unforeseen ways.
Increasing the block size limit requires a hard fork change to the bitcoin protocol, which while the issue of how, specifically, to roll out this change and what the change should entail, is extremely hard and risky to do so long as the topic is highly debated such as it is today.
A painless and uncontentious hard fork requires the consent and support of every participant in the network: miners, nodes, merchants, exchanges, etc., which is why it's a tough problem solve.

bitcoin-cli is a command-line utility which allows you to query your node.
Put bitcoin-cli on your path and you can call any rpc command like you can in the Bitcoin Core console, ie:
    bitcoin-cli getbestblockhash
You'll need to configure some rpc user/passwords in bitcoin.conf
You can also query the node from some application using the RPC interface of bitcoind on :8332

This is the very thing that gives the coin value, which raises the price, which makes mining profitable, which leads to the very situation you describe and so dread. An excellent and intended side-effect to this 'dreadful' situation is a supremely secure network and increasingly irreversible ledger, which could otherwise be trivially attacked by anyone with the interest.
What you're proposing is bitcoin without the coin. Or alternatively, a cryptocurrency system with incentives better aligned to your interests would be a highly and increasingly inflationary one.


Not even slightly. The *in*ability to participate in the *contribution of work* cheaply or, as you delicately put it, *fruitily*, is not something that makes bitcoin inviable. The inability to *validate* the network and these contributions of work, is what makes bitcoin inviable. The latter is not (yet) the case.

The purpose of mining is to perform an amount of work such that the cost to perform the work again for the purpose of rewriting a given portion of history is prohibitively high.
This role can be filled by a single entity, a 'natural' monopoly, at the condition that this entity may be replaced by other free market participants (ie. is not using something like a patent to prevent competition) that fill the role better (which would be the case when this monopoly is abusing its position).

Well onion routing.
Messages for each hop are encrypted in layers, and each layer can only be decrypted by the relevant hop.
All the sender needs is a route, and he can proceed to make all hops on that route be unaware of both the origin or destination.
Tor does the same thing / started it all.

The difficulty / bits target is recalculated every 2016 blocks deterministically by taking the median of the timestamp of the last x blocks, and using that to come to a target that would result in a block created every 10 minutes.
Its presence in the block header *is* redundant in that sense: full nodes would be able to derive the value by looking at the past. 
However, its presence in the headers does present some advantages. For example, it allows a block's PoW to be validated independently of anything else. It also allows SPV to 'tack' on at some number of blocks in the past, rather than starting from the genesis block, with some reasonable assumptions on what a valid PoW target might look like (they could trivially be tricked into following the wrong - a work-less - chain otherwise). For full nodes, it provides a (significant) DDoS protection by allowing them to do a quick sanity check on nothing-but-the-header before requesting the full block, and validating the block's validity within the chain further.

Well isn't that a different security assumption altogether? That's the assumption where, by random chance due to latencies (not attack), the blockchain won't be reorganised starting from genesis (or whatever far-gone point). Which is a probability that is impressively close to 100% as soon as 10 blocks deep.
The security assumption that would erode, is that instead of trusting *only* the genesis block hash, you'd be trusting some other block hash in the future (whether by checkpoint/UTXO snapshot, or dynamic, as can be made possible with headers-first and UTXO commitments)
Whether we can reasonably allow for this assumption to wither a bit? Probably at least maybe. But, undeniably, scaling based on this erosion being acceptable changes an expectation people may have made in the past that they could always sync from the start, and begin anew from scratch.
Further, in being unable to validate from scratch due to prohibitive complexity of such a task, you can never be fully objective toward *all* of the past; your objectivity stops from the moment you start trusting that one hash; you stop trusting the genesis hash, representative of a state of the block chain when there was literally no monetary stake inside it - and instead start trusting the conglomerate of nodes and miners that were there at the time, presumably all having monetary stake in it, and, with it, a reason to lie. Your perspective is all of the sudden forced to be subjective.
Remind you of anything? Because that same perspective is what a PoS block chain, inevitably, is.
So, whether *that's* fine.. Probably at least maybe ;) But I doubt I wanna explore this with Bitcoin.

What would naturally drop the transaction throughput is when miner's don't consider inclusion of a transaction into their block worth it.
Validationless mining is not a natural reduction, they do it for the sole reason of snatching the block subsidy; they *can't* include transactions, because they *don't know* if those transactions were included in the last block.
It is an expression of greed. And that's a fine reason to exploit this, but it doesn't mean the network shouldn't fix it for all.

No working lightning network yet.
As it stands today, it appears the lightning network *only* requires a soft fork which introduces OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, which is a soft fork that is independent of the lightning network and for which implementations have been available for months. (the former, not so sure about the latter). A true malleability fix is no longer *strictly* needed (as was previously suggested) for lightning to work, but still very much desired.
Subscribe to this mailing list to observe recent developments, it's very much in the bleeding edge stage:

Looks like this is an independent merchant making up fees. iDEAL/alternatives charge merchants a monthly fixed fee to be allowed to use them. It's been going on for years - though might not be visible because many merchants oftentimes choose to offer it as a service and not have customers pay for it (except in the price of the product).
Further, iDEAL and issuers of CCs are not banks - they're payment providers/services.
While the fees are disproportionately high, it isn't the banks that are doing this directly, it's merchants choosing to accept their torment.

The problems he mentioned were identified clearly from the get-go in '09/'10, and all of them have been solved or have proposals in the pipeline:
- The lack of recovery services (phone a number) can be solved by various flavours of cosigners and encrypted backups, and even secure third-party backups. P2SH / multisig, and BIP 32 HD wallets, both rolled out in 2012 allow for this to happen. Custodians can also provide an alternative here in the exact same way banks do for cash.
- Running a full node is not strictly required in order to have access to the network; light wallets / SPV wallets / custodial wallets can all allow you to send/receive Bitcoin without any overhead. Hell, there's services out there that allow you to do it over SMS.
- The 'delay' in payments can be worked around by trusted cosigners such as GreenAddress, and more recently BitGo, which has already been implemented by half a dozen exchanges. Alternatively, merchants can choose to risk being double-spent when accepting 0-conf payments, although this is inadvisable for a great many reasons. Further down the line there'll be payment channel networks such as Lightning or similar that allow instantaneous secure peer-to-peer payments, which is the actual proper solution.
- The long-term incentives for miners can be solved by a functioning fee market, perhaps nothing but an anti-ddos-fee is enough, which has been in place since the very start.

Coinbase's (basic) vault system is pretty solid, though. *If* you're willing to trust Coinbase to handle security for you, or if you're more confident in *them* to handle *your* security, than you are in yourself doing it (which is entirely reasonable).
Go for it! But! .... If you're willing, you should look into the advanced vault option, which *does* give you control over the keys (along with Coinbase), in a multisig wallet. But be sure to educate yourself on how it works, how to recover, how to not be nervous. It's either that, or you're trusting Coinbase.

It shows the relation between the general availability of kidneys, and the amount of money given to donors. I'm quite sure the chart would be rather different in the former case.
The former case would parallel the barrier to running a node better, where 'incompatible kidney' can be replaced by 'cost to running a node too high'.

What the fees will end up being will be very interesting to discover. People seem vastly prepared to have their Bitcoin generating passive income.
For example, Bitfinex Bitcoin lending rates are in the ballpark of a mere 0.005% *daily*, that platform being centralised and fully trusted, introducing somewhat significant risk (imo), I can imagine Lightning fees being much lower than even that. Considering throughput can be arbitrarily high, cost per hop can be made arbitrarily low depending on demand. Though there'll be other factors at play here, like risk of coins being locked up pending OP_CSV resolution during which no income can be generated.
I'm very excited to find out how it's all gonna play out.

The Lightning Network is a layer-2 'write-cache' scheme that works directly on top of Bitcoin. You're creating actual Bitcoin transactions that represent payment channels with peers that you *can* broadcast whenever you want, which, through some clever economic tricks, allows participants to navigate money through a network to another peer *without having to* broadcast the transactions, so long as everyone plays nice.
If someone tries to cheat you, you broadcast a transaction to the Bitcoin network, which will settle a refund transaction back to you; the cheater loses all his money, and you will be given all funds in the channel.
So long as everyone is honest, it works swimmingly and peers can send funds instantly and securely in a decentralized network, without every moving away from Bitcoin-the-network.
Sidechains are separate blockchain that allow coins to be 'pegged' to the Bitcoin blockchain. To secure them, they are merge-mined using Bitcoin PoW proofs. Put simply. You can send money from the mainnet blockchain to a sidechain by, essentially, 'locking' the coins on the Bitcoin blockchain. You can send money from the sidechain back to the Bitcoin blockchain by submitting an SPV proof that 'unlocks' them. Sort of.
They are completely different, and serve different purposes.
The Lightning Network is (primarily) a scalability solution that increases transactional capacity on the Bitcoin network arbitrarily high; peers can communicate money to one another however often they so desire (given they have coins) without permanently imposing cost on independent validators of the Bitcoin network.
Sidechains can be used to do pretty much anything. So far they are interesting because they allow for a permissionless testbed of innovation on top of the blockchain. The barrier to innovating on top of the Bitcoin mainnet chain is typically quite high, which sidechains could potentially solve. Sidechains obsolete many altcoins that need to bootstrap an entirely new coin just to test some new feature/direction, and allows development of those altcoins to happen with an already-bootstrapped currency.
Whether sidechains are a practical scaling solution; not really. They suffer the same fundamental scaling problems any Blockchain does.

Block size does not translate directly into transaction throughput.
If a block is 4MB under segwit as it stands pops up, then those transactions would probably be specially curated to cause it to be that worst-validation-case size. ie. txs containing only 16-16 multisigs. It would be unlikely that they are representative of actual transactions normal users would make now or in the future. A ~4MB segwit block would contain *less* individual transactions than a block we're seeing pass by today would, in fact, it'd contain about 1.

Some clarifications:
There is no explicit fee. And there is no separate transaction to move change back to yourself. It's all one transaction.
Consider cash. I want to pay you 10 dollars, but I only have a 50 dollar bill. I will give you the 50 dollar bill, and you give me two 20 dollar bills in return. Are these 2 transactions? Or only 1? It's only 1 transaction; me giving you 10 dollars. Bitcoin works in the exact same way.
The fee in Bitcoin is the difference in inputs (50 dollar bill) and outputs (2x20 dollar bill for me, 1x10 dollars for you). For the analogous cash transaction described above, the fee would be 0. (...)
In Bitcoin, the fee is typically subtracted from the change amount.
How did you create the transaction that got stuck? What wallet did you use?

- Your impression of LN's privacy is wrong; you don't know who's paying who.

Blocks, many blocks. At a sample size of 1 (measuring for last block only) the hashrate number will be so irrepresentative of the network's actual hashrate it'll be useless. Typical sample sizes you'll see in charts are 504 (blocks), 1008 and 2016 (this last one being what the protocol uses to readjust itself to generate a block every 10 minutes)
The hashrate number is an attempt at a metric of the amount of computing power the network churns out at any given time, its accuracy depends on the sample size taken.
Small sample size: less accurate but reflective of today's actual hashrate (non-lagging and high noise)
High sample size: more accurate but irreflective of today's actual hashrate (lagging and low noise)

What you're describing is more-or-less the solution (well, it's sort of different, but the gist of it is the same).
With the addition that Peter's proposal is a proof specific for an individual miner by requiring they hash the next-block coinbase tx into the prev-block-knowledge-proof (which would prevent sharing this otherwise universally valid alt-hash of nothing but the prevblock merkle among miners)


current block's coinbase txouts (unique per miner for obvious reasons!)
as well as the previous block hash. Then recompute the previous block's
witness data merkle tree (and optionally, transaction data merkle tree)
with that hash prepended to the serialized data for each witness.

I'm not intimitely familiar with how Core does this today.
As far as I'm aware, wallets used to take the oldest coins available and spend those, FIFO style. There wasn't really a good technical reason for that (apart from those coins being more likely to be spent for free with de-facto BDD tx prioritisation), and would quickly link together addresses, compromising your privacy.
A slightly better (imo) method would be to closely match the amount you're sending with funds available outputs, in an attempt to conceal the amount of money you have by minimising the change you're sending back to  yourself.
Ideally, a wallet would (also) internally link together addresses, and try to avoid spending multiple transaction outputs in concert if they haven't been linked together yet in an effort to try and preserve privacy.
Here's a (stellar) talk by Gregory where he touches on the topic:
 (start at 17m11s)
Going from that, it was still pretty shit a little under a year ago; the wallet will inadvertently link addresses together quite quickly, though it does track linkage. I can't recall a change in this logic since then, so assume nothing's changed here.

Yep. Currently the witness data resides within the transactions, segwit pulls that out into a data structure that is committed to elsewhere in the block (the coinbase transaction).
The witnesses are no longer accounted for in the block size as we are familiar with it today, and are, instead, discounted by 75% before summing its size with the block size once more.
This is why it's a soft fork; blocks (if seen from current perspective) still won't be larger than 1MB. But they will represent much more than 1MB worth of data if you're upgrading your node to understand segwit.
Witness data is typically some ~40-60% of a transaction depending on the transaction, 75% of that is no longer accounted for in the block size with segwit.

This fee is, ironically, what will end up protecting the network from having governments and other entities with ill-intent from interfering with the system's continuing operation. This fee is providing incentive for individuals that seek to secure the network and move it forward, and is awarded to the miner that includes your transaction in its block.

The model as it was presented back then (which was touching more on payment channels and hashed timelock contracts, than it did a network) would've been way more sensitive to censorship and ruining privacy. The onion model they came up with a few months later when actual implementation / protocol design started pretty much negates all of that.
I doubt the thought of really having a 'clear text' routing model implemented was ever seriously entertained beyond the concept.

It's a blatant slap to anyone who's ever used the [correct] term of backward compatibility when regarding a soft fork.
Forward compatibility implies knowledge of an existing system to know, or accommodate, the behaviour of a future version of that system, thereby allowing it to be compatible. Forward compatibility is the bitcoin scripting language, to some extent, *not* soft forks, those are backward compatible.
The way Hearn described it in the article is like saying ASCII is forward compatible with UTF-8.

Bunch of different ones exist in this network:
There's n people, doing validation of n transactions. That's O(n^2) validation complexity.
There's another for the initial sync at linear block size growth, takes O(n^2) to do an IBD over time.
And another for broadcast, n people transmitting n data; total data moving through the network is O(n^2).
Yet another one in OP_CHECKSIG. For every n OP_CHECKSIGs in a transaction, the entire n sized transaction needs to be hashed. That's O(n^2) worth of hashing.

Like any other block, a block found within this period amounts to the full amount of work. And it will always be a block that has no transactions in it (save coinbase). It follows that this will be accounted for in the next difficulty adjustment - inflating difficulty, and under the assumption this behavior will exist going forward into that new difficulty era, net transactional capacity decreases, as the given % of blocks found under these conditions will be empty.
Further, if all miners all of the sudden stop exhibiting this behavior, less blocks will be found within the next difficulty period (as orphan rate increases), resulting in the same % reduction of net transactional capacity.
This is not a topic of argument; it is fact.

When you say things like that, this is what I hear:

The free market wants more coins, therefore we must raise the limit."

As I said, we'd be forgetting history, and only the nodes that are then running will have an objective view of the past. Nobody else would be able to do a full past-objective UTXO synchronisation.
We'd still be able to exchange the UTXO set, and spin up new nodes, but they'd be trusting the ones that provide the UTXO set. We could make that a bit better with UTXO commitments, which stagnates objective security to the point in the past the commitment was created. (both of these measures still need to be implemented)
If the historic blockchain is forgotten by the network at large, then the ability to form an objective and full perspective to the beginning of time (genesis block) will forever be lost.

This "fraud" can only be successful when users accept payment naively early, which, in a &gt;51% miner situation especially, is a risk they take and can trivially mitigate simply by waiting longer.
Further, when miners choose to engage in any sort of 51% attack, that is a choice with a massive opportunity cost especially in case of failure, creating a margin for competition to fill. While this threat exists, I doubt it is sustainable.
Finally, when advocating for mining to be decentralised, you are essentially telling miners doing the best job to do it less effectively. Remind you of anything? ;)

Then I must have misinterpreted this: "I do not think, in an Austrian economy, we would be void of irrational bubbles", because in an Austrian economy and from an Austrian perspective, such bubbles are _by definition_ impossible, because there is no such thing as irrationality in human action: Rationality is a range that starts from 0 and knows no negative.

I disagree; it was a perfect example of how chronically incomplete information, misinformation and broken logic caused people to _rationally_ _(from their perspective)_ choose to engage in highly unsound economic activity.


This sounds like highly rational behavior to me.


There's the incomplete information.


And there's the broken logic.


At no point were any of the actors in the housing crisis behaving irrationally; they, evidently, truly believed they were engaging in sound investing. The fact they weren't does not make their behavior irrational in the slightest.
In a sentence: Under the assumption where any actor always acts to achieve fulfillment of wants, there can be no irrationality.
Hence: what we're having a disagreement over is the definition of irrationality.
And this is a basic fundamental premise of Austrian economics, which is what makes me doubt claimed extensive research on the topic.

Not really agreeing or disagreeing with him because I'm sort of struggling with how this will churn out myself. But some thoughts:
His [highly paraphrased] premise seems to be: "government wants to go to space, people don't" --- which I think is ridiculous on its face.. very little people I know, at least, do not want humans to explore space. In my mind, it's people that want to go to space, and governments that don't.


His reasoning for coming to this conclusion is that leading a space frontier involves "unquantified risks" -- which, again, seems absolutely ridiculous. Charting the bounds of unquantified risk is the defining property of entrepreneurship, I can't understand how, _even if it is true that private enterprise will never lead a space frontier_, the reason for that would be that it is unquantified risks that keeps private enterprise from doing so.
If anything, I would expect his primary reasoning to be that we have too little entrepreneurship in our society to meaningfully extend the human space frontier. In which case the solution, I would think, lies with removing such restrictions that prevent entrepreneurship in this possibly very promising industry from happening as much as possible.


Regardless of anything, regardless of state, or government, or private enterprise.. when determined people come together to accomplish some shared goal, then neither state nor government nor private enterprise can keep them from doing so.
In the end, it's a people's enterprise that will lead this frontier. Whether the enterprise was conceived of out of government or private enterprise seems irrespective to the fact that people direct the wheel.

Many would argue, myself among which, that the incentives have already skewed such that we are already departing our decentralised roots.
In fact, current behavior of miners indicates this departure will happen regardless of any limit (though higher sizes will certainly expedite the effects) because: 
- Most miners don't validate new blocks
- They listen to one another's stratum endpoints and mine on top of those
- They are effectively one pool
- They are subsequently delaying block relay of new blocks
Which results in:
- Miners that don't partake will be mining stale blocks most of the time
- These miners will not be profitable
- These miners will run out of business
Which ends us up with:
- The effective single pool that is not validating and are mining on eachother's stratum endpoints
Which means:
- The network has been 51% attacked into centralisation
All of this is happening today.

In the long term it's been pretty predictable through curves like 
Though admittedly one other fundamental difference between gold and Bitcoin is that, for gold, one can increase the work put into mining and expect an increase in yield, whereas for Bitcoin the yield will remain the same over time.


Same goes for bitcoins; both monies have arisen out of commodity value. In fact, all monies have arisen out of commodity value in one way or another.
These two commodity monies can be treated the same because their monetary properties are the same, namely; it cannot be trivially inflated by government. Which, really, is the only property a sound money needs thesedays.
@_date: 2016-09-14 11:59:06


There is no need to assign a conversion value between paper and bitcoin like is the case with gold; a bitcoin standard or specie bitcoins would make no sense because bitcoins are trivial to move.
The reason a gold standard was ever conceived of is because gold is heavy and tough to move; paper can be placed in a wallet and moved with no effort, if the number that is stamped on top of it is convertible to some weight in gold then people used to considered that 'good enough'.


A standard is not a peg - a standard is the establishment of a set conversion value between 2 things, in the case of the gold standard between gold and paper. Pegs are impossible to maintain ad infinitum whereas standards are.


Central banks may choose to employ instruments such as fiat credit expansion in order to exert control over 'their' monetary system. A practice which they must pay back later - which is also the reason these things usually don't end up working out: central banks and government generally feel they can refrain from paying their debt.

Yes, only miners produce work.


A confirmation happens when a new block is stacked on top of the 'tip' of the chain. Every time a miner finds a new block [at the tip of the chain], then that's a confirmation. So yeah they contribute to the amount of work, in that a new valid block is found which has taken work to find.

edit: OP deleted comment, question was "what is a sidechain?"
It's a separate chain, potentially secured in a totally different way than the bitcoin blockchain (although it would typically be merge-mined, giving it close-to-equivalent-security), which allows a two-way-'peg' between the 2 chains. Meaning, you can transfer bitcoin to the sidechain, and back to the bitcoin blockchain. Effectively, some amount of bitcoin can be 'frozen' on the bitcoin blockchain, and created on the sidechain. When transferring back they will be destroyed on the sidechain, and unfrozen on the bitcoin blockchain.
Sidechains allow us to innovate on top of the existing network with less friction; currently, it's very hard to experiment with and test (large) new features on top of the bitcoin blockchain, because it would require the consent of everyone participating on that chain. 
Sidechains give us the ability to innovate and test new things without risk, without permission, and without having to bootstrap a completely new chain/altcoin.
Already, Blockstream has created a permissioned sidechain called Alpha on the Bitcoin Testnet which allows us to experiment with tons of new features, such as confidential transaction (where the amount of the transaction is encrypted) and several other experiments (Elements):

The most appealing solution in the near term is (still) segregated witness (segwit), presented in december 2015 by Pieter Wuille on the Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong conference. The roadmap formulated by Bitcoin Core which has segwit as its primary prize horse has overwhelming consensus among the developer community.
Road map:
Segregated witness:
By now, segwit code is ready, tested, reviewed and merged into Bitcoin Core 0.13.0. But not activated yet.
Presumably Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 will include BIP9 soft fork activation parameters that miners will use to signal whether they support the soft fork (in terms of whether they will validate the new consensus rules), after which the network will activate the new rules 2016 blocks after a 95% signaling threshold (after block height % 2016 where that condition is true).
There's a few more things that need to be tacked on top of segwit in order to finalise it for activation on the network, which will all be included in 0.13.1:
To get a feel for 0.13.1 progress:
Beyond segwit, there is also Compact Blocks and the FIBRE network, which are both based on the same technology.
The former is a p2p propagation technique which seeks to reduce bandwidth during block relay among peers, the latter is a network between miners which seeks to reduce latency at the expense of bandwidth. Both of these (though especially the latter) should help mitigate problems we are having as a result of orphans, and a skewing of incentives that big miners can take advantage of if they are willing.
(though the critical observer would note they are not as effective as one would hope, because these big miners no longer validate and, because of that, can take advantage of a centralising propagation technique that is far superior to anything else - which is listening on competitor's Stratum endpoints - which is a problem that has so far gone somewhat ignored)
Lightning Network implementations, which would offer us near-infinite scale among interconnected peers through on-chain channels, are well on their way, and it's getting hard to keep track of all the different people working on implementations out there.

Hashrate isn't a vote. Bitcoin is an anarchic system, there's no voting in anarchism. The sovereign individual running a full node is the only entity with any power in this system, and all this power extends to is his own autonomy.
Value is subjective and relative to each individual, price is determined in the marketplace by these individuals deciding to buy or to sell, to hodl or to sodl. Hashrate has little choice but to follow price, theirs is a tangible cost they endure constantly, which in the long run they must earn back, or lose forever - they do this by mining the most profitable chain, or going broke in an attempt to defy reason.

Same way money in the bank is owned by the people who put it there, not the bank? Same way a bank is a benevolent agency that can just be left unchecked - even by its own customers, because the above is somehow true?
The claim where pool operators are _not_ equivalent to hardware owners is only valid if hardware owners take precautionary and reasonable action when pool operators are abusing power given to them. Sort of like a bank run.
In practice, this isn't happening, which can be evidenced by over 60% of the current hashrate operating as effectively a single pool - depriving the remaining 40% of their income.
If hardware owners would jump ship and switch pool operator, then I'd agree with you. But unfortunately reality sings a different song. The incentives are skewed a different way, and the notion that &gt;50% of the network hashrate is controlled by a single entity has long been fact.

There's roughly 2^96 valid public keys for every address.
The public key space is (roughly; a little less than) 2^256.
The address space is 2^160.
So that's 2^256-160 keys per address give or take a few billion.
[edit] To answer your question more specifically:


No. There is 1 address for 1 private key.
There's ~2^96 valid private keys for 1 address.
In other words, there's only 1 way to get from your private key to your address, there's many ways to get from an address to a valid private key (though all of them are equally infeasible to find when 'going backward')

Yes. Only the contents in an unbroken chain from the highest-work block down to the genesis block are is considered valid. If a previously unknown highest-work chain appears out of nowhere, then that will replace all blocks that don't match with the 'minority' chain.


They are given this data when the majority miner broadcasts the blocks in his secret highest-work chain.
Further, fully validating nodes will keep a database worth of 'undo' data that can undo the UTXO set a couple hundred blocks, in order to frictionlessly handle reorganisations down to that level. Admittedly, though, if a tens-of-blocks reorganisation ever happens (and it has, ie. august 2010, march 2013, july 2015), then that is a clear indicator there has been either a bug or an attack (knowingly or otherwise).

It's highly disputable. It may, effectively, appear as though that is true, but it isn't. In a peg a certain exchange value is 'guaranteed' by some entity, whereas in a standard there is complete backing of the guaranteed asset; actually guaranteeing it.
That's how standards are designed at least. In practice, of course, it has never lasted, because governments (or in the case of a free market money: banks) discover they can print paper and inflate the effective money supply while getting away with it, until they don't, and the system collapses.


They print paper and pay it back later. Essentially they start running a fractional reserve bank and pray they get away with it. It works up to some point.

The 'longest chain' is an incorrect definition, because the length of the chain is not relevant. The amount of 'work' in a chain is what is relevant: the network considers the chain with the highest amount of 'work' valid, not the chain with the greatest length. Indeed, I could create a chain that is longest of all, at difficulty 1, and the network would _not_ consider it valid.
While it's true that 'longest chain' is somehow used the most in practice, it is not accurate.

Heh, oh I know. I didn't mean to imply law is somehow an impermeable thing.


I wasn't. ;)
In the following tidbit I tried to make the godlike ability of people to ignore any law explicit:
"US currency is legal tender, it is fungible and will be readily substituted by, **if nothing else**, the US government."
Even if nobody cares about the US government and its petty rules, then US currency would still be fungible, because there is at least one user (its issuer/owner) that is requiring itself to recognise any of its notes to be equal to any other through legal tender laws that it is requiring itself to abide by. Only when this entity ceases to exist will US currency no longer be fungible. (FTR - each individual note has a unique number printed on it which one may use, in case one does not have crayons handy, to record its presence). In any case; US currency is fungible because its owning entity wills it to be through archaic constructs that throughout history have never been able to last.
Such archaic constructs - had they been viable instruments - could not even apply to Bitcoin, because Bitcoin has no owning entity. There can therefore _not_ be a law that makes bitcoins fungible because such a law is inherently meaningless, considering not a single law-making entity yields the authority or ability to wrench Bitcoin into these archaic constructs that make a thing abide by law. It is no more possible to make law apply to Bitcoin than it is to make PI move closer to the number 3.2.

Yep, each segwit version potentially could run an entirely different scripting engine.
(also, we were never restricted to 8 OP_NOPs because we could just make the 8th OP_NOP define 256 new OP_NOPs in the next byte, and so on - though that's ugly in comparison to segwit)


It says 0 _to_ 16, which one might interpret to mean it's exclusive of 16. Though I agree it might lead to confusion (using 17 numbers is a bit odd) - so, wouldn't hurt to submit a PR to propose to make it unambiguous / ask why.
A byte can represent 256 values, so it would work in either case. But one is weird, the other is not. (Actually both are weird - I see no reason to not go up to 255)


Yes, these are address versions. Note that BIP142 has been deferred and no wallets (that I know of) will support it when segwit activates.
In any case, address versions are used to indicate the output format a receiver is expecting (ie. 0x00 for P2PKH, 0x05 for P2SH), and is unrelated to anything that hits the blockchain or consensus (beyond that these versions would preferably not have ambiguity in reality).

Rainbow tables aren't really used anymore because it's almost faster to just generate all possibilities out of some dictionary+combinations of probable passwords using a GPU than to lookup a value (not really 'almost faster' - but point is that rainbow tables lost their utility long ago).


Hmmm ok, that'd mitigate it a fair bit. Though it's only a linear relation, which isn't very future-proof, and the rounds of hashing a website would be willing to bear is limited because they wouldn't want to DoS themselves or impede UX, while an attacker doesn't have any such limitation.

When you understand how and why Bitcoin works, you can simply forget about the technicalities and treat its monetary effects as though it is gold.
The greatest difference between gold and Bitcoin from a monetary point of view, is that bitcoins are easier to move, and there is thus a less significant reason for banks to exist.
There's some caveats in the details, of course, all of which are trivial if this thing works out.

Here's an arbitrarily chosen address with a balance:

Which means approximately 4.64 x 10^25 hashes are required to produce the chain up to that block. That number is the amount of work.

It's somewhat possible, surprisingly.
In the MimbleWimble paper, a method was proposed to sort of aggregate transactions of the above type (4 transactions going from A, through B, C and D to E) into a single transaction.
It's quite restrictive, though, because it isn't compatible with Script as we know it, so that would almost definitely need to happen on a sidechain or something.

So the P2WPKH and P2WSH script constructs will work perfectly fine without an address version/format standard because the address version/format is used merely to indicate the type of transaction a receiver is expecting, and to contain the payload required for a sender to send to it.
Part of the reason it was deferred is because many people think the current BASE58CHECK address construct is deficient, and it would be counterproductive to reuse it for the transaction constructs that will move us into the future with segwit; we don't wanna be stuck with an inferior address format for this like we have with P2SH and P2PKH. 
BASE58CHECK's characterset is annoying (capital letters, similar symbols), there's no way to remember them in full or in part, there's no human-capable way to easily and fully check their validity, or whether it's been tampered with. We need some future-proof thing that makes sense instead.

(pinging for coreply)
In the end, whichever of the block exists in the 'highest work chain' (often called the longest chain, which strictly is a misnomer) is the block that is considered valid.
There is no rule that exists (or can exists, because such a rule wouldn't be enforceable by network consensus) that can force an individual miner to decide for one block or the other at the time there are still 2 active chaintips (which strictly is true at any time, but let's ignore that for now). There are [individual] policies that make this decision, which one may analyse game theoretically given some assumptions to arrive at the most sensible/profitable solution.
Under 'healthy' network conditions/assumptions, where miners are not colluding or forming a cartel, the most sensible policy will be to choose the block seen first; the rationale being that presumably this block will have propagated the network the farthest, and under the assumption that most other miners are also running this policy, choosing that block will be most likely to persist in the chain. (which is a sensible assumption to make because under healthy network conditions, this policy is game theoretically optimal)

It costs the majority miner more to keep his chain secret. Because he isn't (yet) being rewarded for the blocks he does not broadcast.
Admittedly this isn't relevant if the miner doesn't rely on profits out of his mined blocks, and gets his funding elsewhere.


The number of confirmations is indicative for the amount of work required to reverse a chain up to that point. If a majority miner is creating a secret chain while you are getting your transaction confirmed, then the number of confirmations does not matter.


It can be reverted if the minority miners take back control of 51% of the mining power and proceed to work on top of the highest work chain competitively.

I feel it's prudent to clarify the notion of 'found' here:
Blocks containing certain unconfirmed transactions don't just hang around all over the place like Pokemon. Miners create them. They get sent a bunch of transactions that are unconfirmed and are propagating through the peer-to-peer network. Then they check if those transactions are valid, and include them in a block they are currently mining. When they produce a valid proof-of-work that makes that block valid to the network, then that block is 'found'.


Yes, using the above definition of 'found'.


Yes. And more specifically, it means it was included in the block that was (from the perspective of the observer) mined most recently: the block has a 'depth' of 1.


Mmmm not quite. 6 confirmations means the block the transaction was included in now has a 'depth' of 6. Meaning, there have been 5 other blocks that were mined more recently, and reside 'on top' of the block the transaction was included in (forming a chain).
Every time a new block is found on top of the current tip of the chain, increases the number of confirmations by 1.
6 confirmations on a transaction therefore means the network has performed 6 blocks worth of work on top of that transaction, and it would take 6 blocks worth of work to reverse that transaction and eliminate it (and all other transactions in those 6 blocks) from history.
@_date: 2016-09-26 14:17:04
Sometimes, by sheer chance, 2 (or any number, really) independent miners in different places around the world will find a new valid best block on the chain they're respectively mining on top of before the other miner's valid block has had a chance to reach them yet.
In other words, there are now 2 valid blocks at the same height in the blockchain.
Considering the blockchain is a chain - a simple list where one block refers to the previous block - only 1 of these blocks may persist inside it. One of them needs to be discarded by the network. This discarded block is called an orphan.
There's also the concept of 'stale' blocks, which are 'concept' blocks that miners are still mining (putting hash cycles into) but aren't yet valid (meaning: miners haven't yet found a nonce that would make for a valid proof-of-work for this block), while somewhere (potentially on the other side of the world) another miner has found a new valid best block, and that block hasn't reached the miner yet.
In essence, all hashing cycles the miner is putting into this block are useless, because there is (from the perspective of the miner that found a new block) a new valid highest work chain that the entire network should be mining on top of.
Orphans are often confused for stale blocks (especially when talking about 'lowering orphan rate' by 'lowering latency' - in fact what 'lowering latency' does is 'lower stale rates', along with orphan rates).

A 51% *attack* in the general sense (there is another, more specific, definition)  means an attacker accrues over 50% of the hashing power (through renting, bribery, running an actual mining operation or whatever else passes mining control to an attacker), and uses it for malevolent ends.
The scope of possible malevolent ends are restricted, because the Bitcoin network does not rely solely on miners, though they are not insignificant.
So let's first investigate what miners do.
As indicates, miners are 'in charge of' making the 'order' in which the network 'agrees it has seen transactions pass by' permanent: they choose a bunch of transactions, stick them in a block, run some calculations until that block has a valid proof of work, then broadcast it to their peers who accept it and proceed to work on top of it. That's all they do.
If it is ever the case there is a single miner that has the majority of hashing power, then this means that that single miner is in fact solely in charge of what transactions go into the shared history of the blockchain; any (conglomerate) of minority miners will churn out less hashing power than the single majority miner, so the single majority miner may - if he so chooses - outcompete all competition and create the highest work chain the way he sees fit.
This has some implications that the majority miner may abuse to his advantage, which are commonly referred to as a 51% attack.
One implication might be that this majority miner can censor transactions: he can disallowing any transactions he does not like by refusing to mine on top of blocks that contain them.
Another implication might be that he delays his block broadcasts, allowing himself to work on the highest work chain, while all other miners are (without knowing) working on a stale block; the majority miner is guaranteed to produce the highest work chain given enough time, so there is no reason to broadcast his blocks in a timely manner because that would allow minority miners to be more competitive. This has as a result that all minority miners will go out of business, leaving only the majority miner as a ~100% miner and sole producer of blocks. It can also go unnoticed for a very long while.
Another implication might be that he produces a higher work chain than the chain that is publicly being produced and visible to all of the network. This 'secret' higher work chain could then contain an array of transactions that are in fact double spends of transactions on the 'visible' chain, which the miner may use to purchase things / move around money, and later reverse those transactions upon broadcasting his secret chain. This attack is probabilistically detectable (because if a majority miner is withholding blocks for a long while then that would be increasingly unlikely to occur naturally), and may in most cases be mitigated or avoided by vendors simply by waiting for confirmations. This was classically referred to as the 51% attack, though clearly the implications for its conditions (being a majority miner) are wider than this vector.

No, a currency is _required_ for a blockchain to function; it needs an incentive model, and this incentive model needs a token.


All this needs is a commitment scheme, which does not need a token, let alone a blockchain which offers 'smart contracts'. Commitments can be made on Bitcoin. Ethereum and all the other scams are solutions created by the lazy, which is fine by me but don't forget to call them what they are; scams.

That something is legacy transaction fee estimators/wallets overestimating the fee, and economically rational miners preferring them over segwit transactions that are paying a 'normal'/lower fee.


Not until the non-segwit transactions outbidding the segwit transactions are exhausted.
All of this is solved when wallets estimate based on weight rather than [stripped] size, until such time, wallets that estimate based on size will pay a higher fee. (I'll note, they would pay a higher fee in any case because they're spending using a less optimized transaction type; a non-segwit transaction, this phenomenon just appears to exacerbate that a bit)

@_date: 2017-10-24 12:27:47
It seems this is because of old pre-segwit wallets overestimating their fee, because when calculating a suitable fee using their mempool, they do not see witnesses, and as such will believe all of a transaction's fee is for the non-segwit/legacy parts of the transaction.
As a result, this node will wrongly think a transaction is paying a higher-than-actual-average fee, and will adjust the fees for its own transactions accordingly (to the north).
This would be triggered by a backlog in the mempool, causing these wallets to try and get enough priority for inclusion in the next [or an early] block, and in so doing overestimating by a large amount. The result is that a disproportionate amount of non-segwit transaction gain priority.
It's not really all that problematic except that these older fee estimation algorithms are now slightly broken and will tend to yield fees that are sometimes too high, resulting in drops in the segwit adoption graph like we're seeing here. If anything this will serve as an incentive for these wallets' fee estimation algorithms to upgrade and take transaction weighting into account.

Full nodes do this, miners are only submitting proof-of-work (which they create through mining) in the form of new blocks, which the network will verify and accept if considered valid. Miners do 'work' which needs to be re-done in order for the blockchain to be reversed to a certain point, they don't do transaction verification.
Do note: All miners (pools and independent miners) must also be running a full node.


Nothing. By then the mining reward will be negligible (it'll go from 1 satoshi, or 1 hundred millionth of a bitcoin, to 0) and the network will be completely run by transaction fees, as it will for the most part have been for decades. Assuming bitcoin still exists by then.

You're correct in saying decentralized applications are less efficient than centralized ones, but not for the reasons you state.
The reason the bitcoin network is very costly to run is because we are creating an economic disincentive to maliciously be part of the network. This is not the same as saying it is costly because it is decentralized.
Not everything that is decentralized depends on such economic factors, and they can be fairly efficient (although theoretically will never be as efficient as centralized applications), but they will often scale much much better and especially, they will put no one party in control. (Ie. the internet)
In the case of OpenBazaar, it is relevant because there is no leader at the top who can shut the whole thing down, or have the assets they're holding on another's behalf stolen, destroyed, seized or otherwise at risk. There is no one corruptible party that can permission or depermission any other party from contribiting, and there is not a plug to be pulled. *That* is why OB is relevant.
@_date: 2015-04-20 20:02:39


You are not :)


Strictly speaking. Yes.
Through methods such as sidechannels (which is extremely hard, but in the near future may not be all that unrealistic) on poorly written signing software (which sadly includes the most commonly used library, openSSL) it is possible to derive/estimate the private key used in a signature. This involves having very intimate access to your signing device such that it's possible to obtain power consumption, timing, things like that.
I wouldn't say that's very realistic for, say, a mobile phone. And I definitely wouldn't say it's realistic this were to happen in a public setting, but it's a worry that's getting increasingly more attention, which is a good thing.
Further, if there's ever a vulnerability detected in ECDSA (the signature algorithm) which allows you to derive more information about the private key given knowledge of a bunch of signatures, then yes, this is a problem. Which is the reason you should never reuse an address (reducing the layers of security on top of a private key containing unspent coins down to ECDSA only, rather than ECDSA, plus SHA256 and RIPE-MD: two hashing algorithms serving as additional layers of security on top of a private key)
As for realistic risks (made possible through MITM). Like online banking, it is *never* a smart thing to do any sort of banking (which includes bitcoin related transacting, like browsing a webshop you're intending to pay using bitcoin) over an insecure communications channel.
I said this earlier:


And that's true. But bear in mind that a malicious public WiFi operator, or anyone MITM'ing your connection may abuse insecure communication to, for example, display a payment address other than the one you're supposed to send to. Essentially tricking you into sending bitcoin to the attacker instead of the merchant.
Bitcoin is not a reason to start using insecure communications channels everywhere. Bitcoin transactions themselves *can* be sent over the wire as-is without worry, but other than that you should never put your full faith in an insecure connection (such as when paying for stuff).
TL;DR - Like online banking, use HTTPS (or equivalently secure) for (e-)shopping.

Not necessarily local, but yes.
You can use Coinbase's vault feature, which gives you bilateral control over they keys like a safe deposit box (if you want to keep using coinbase). Or GreenAddress, which acts as a cosigner. Or multibit and other light desktop wallets which give you full control.
You could also install MyCelium or another mobile wallet (full local control on your phone), send a small amount to it and play around a bit.
Donate a dollar to Wikipedia or something to see how transacting works.
If you're really interested in how the network works or you want to contribute to it, you could give running a full bitcoin node a go. Download Bitcoin Core, retrieve the full blockchain, verify its contents, relay transactions. It's a nice learning experience.

They are different things, really.
An address is a destination for some expenditure of coins.
A wallet is software which allows you to control spending 'from' your own addresses  to other addresses. They can use only one address (like blockchain.info), or multiple independently generated addresses (like Bitcoin Core), or use a single seed to generate multiple addresses (the preferred way, like MyCelium or GreenAddress, these are HD wallets)
The important thing to understand is that using the same address multiple times reduces security of that address, and reduces your (and others') privacy. By *spending* 'from' an address you will expose the public key of that address on the blockchain. An exposed public key is still secure, but there's only one 'layer' of security before you get to the private key - which is the thing that must always remain private, because it allows you to sign transactions. Coins that have been sent to an address that have not yet been spent 'from' that address (ie. they are still sitting there) do *not* have their public key exposed, only a hash of the public key from which no information of the actual public key can be derived is visible. This adds a layer security, if you will.


You are fully secure unless you use those addresses multiple times.


If you spend from the same address multiple times, it will be obvious it's you spending that.


Mixers allow you to further obfuscate the ownership of coins. Through a lot of effort (or, by having the privilege of being the receiver of coins and knowing the sender) it may be possible to derive the ownership of coins even if you use a different address each time. By using a mixer (or better/decentralized alternatives such as CoinJoin) you are able to anonymize the coins for those who desire privacy.

How is the situation you're suggesting any different from a situation where all participants are honest? Unless you expect your fridge to turn evil and let all of your food go bad, there's no point in your home automation system maintaining a local 'mini-blockchain' over a simple distributed database shared by all devices in your home. Let alone the useless energy your fridge and its peers would waste in the effort of mining to achieve decentralized consensus in a completely trusted environment.
In addition to that, your *private* home automation system is not voluntary nor inclusionary; your neighbour would not be able to participate in your effort of creating a secure ledger for your home to store events in. This is one of the greater strengths of a blockchain with a valuable token; it allows anyone to participate without permission and without fear of them destroying the system. This phenomenon can only exist for a blockchain with a valuable token because there is more to gain for participants by participating fairly, than there is by them participating abusively.

Assuming the hardfork makes everything that's come before backward compatible (that is, the way transactions work, it's only the format that's different), which in case of a divisibility increase is the case: Nothing. Everyone will be holding the exact same amount of bitcoin, except it's more divisible.


For transactions in the new format, new software will interpret the 16 byte amount as a number like normal. For transactions of the old format, new software will interpret the 8 byte amount as a 16 byte number &lt;&lt; 64 (shifted 8 bytes to the left)
Old software (software that doesn't understand 16 byte amount fields) will probably consider the transaction invalid/malformed, and scream fire and death. They will not work anymore and fork off the network.


Yes, assuming it's gonna be a hard fork (and I don't see a way it isn't).
Because it's gonna be a hard fork, software is gonna be ready for this well before (as in years) the change is actually pushed through and activated.
It's like changing from IPv4 to IPv6. Old, archaic hardware and software will break, but because this change has been in the pipeline for years and most software/hardware's been updated years in advance, it's all gonna go smoothly (your average internet user is never gonna notice they've changed to IPv6)
// Edit: I'm not sure, but since the transaction is a new version, old software may already 'assume' it is valid, and relay the transaction without thinking twice. They'd be essentially useless as far as contributing to the network and asserting confidence in the network goes, but they wouldn't (have to) die. If this is true, then strictly it isn't a hard fork.

BIP66 activated in block 
As per the rules of that soft fork introduced, blocks with nVersion=2 became invalid. (along with some other rules pertaining to the way transactions are signed)
The first block you referenced at height  was broadcast after BIP 66 had gone into effect, and it had an nVersion value of 2, which made it invalid - other miners ignored it (or should have), orphaning the block. The miner who broadcast this block did not upgrade.
The second block you referenced had a version of 536870919
In binary:
      100000000000000000000000000111
or hex:

You're misunderstanding, then.
Models such as payment channels and the lightning network present us with caching layers which allow for schemes that aggregate many (valid Bitcoin) transactions into a single one.
I understand that, on the face of it, you could refuse to consider this a possibility for scaling, in which case I would strongly urge you to read the lightning network paper. It is eye-opening.
Compacting signatures is unpopular and not often discussed (controversial and complex softfork), but may allow for 10 or so tps (up from 4)
RBF allows transactions, in various cases, to be compacted and combined before being included in a block, shrinking the space consumed.
I will yield for off chain payments.
Other than that I don't know what you're trying to imply. So again, the issue is more nuanced.
// edit: oh right, forgot about extension blocks. They allow for an arbitrarily sized block to be attached to a newly mined block, containing more transactions, and it can be done as a soft fork. It permanently adds complexity to the protocol, so an uncontended hard fork is much preferred, but it is an option which - barring complexity - could satisfy everyone.

They are not there for that reason. They are there to allow clients to skip part of the verification process (by not executing scripts) for historic transactions before the checkpoint.
Check out this talk by Core dev Peter Wuille on Bitcoin Core 0.10, including headers-first:
The bit that answers your question is at 11:10, start watching from 9:20 for the full section.
// Edit:
To expand a bit more.
Checkpoints exist *primarily* to skip full verification of blocks *before* a checkpoint. They *also* allow you to prevent massive reorganisations, but if that ever happens then bitcoin has failed completely, because to revert the blockchain all the way down to a checkpoint and reorganise from there is consensus-breaking and should be impossible by design. So again, checkpoints exist to skip verification of blocks *before* a checkpoint.
So, why does headers-first improve upon this so we can get rid of checkpoints entirely?
Previously, peers would only feed you block hashes, which is only a 256 bit hash which exposes zero information about the block itself. You need to download the full block to see what its contents are. So, before you know the amount of work that's been put into a block, you need to download it fully, rather than only the 80 byte block headers.
In the new headers-first mechanism, you will be given the full block headers, which allows you to compute the amount of work that's been put into a block. Knowing this allows you to *assume* it's impossible to revert the blockchain from the tip of the chain to this specific block, which will then allow you to *confidently* skip *full* verification (script execution) for blocks before that.
You still have to download the full blocks, but you don't have to do the full script verification for most of them, and this can now be done without checkpoints.

I don't see it. There's little advantage litecoin has over bitcoin (to be exact: none), and unlike gold and silver, both are equally divisible.
Litecoin and other altcoins will probably have some value for a long time, but only to traders and perhaps some leftover advocates. But eventually, I think all of them will fade away.

Unfortunately we'll have to fix rounding issues, which is easiest if we simply do not do doubles. Integers only.
Right now, the 'amount' field is 8 bytes long. I reckon the easiest way of increasing divisibility is to double that, or maybe add 4, whatever, but doubling has my preference (because reasons), and shift all 'old' amount fields 64 bits to the left. Done.
The numbers won't be nice and round, but ah well, that isn't the protocol's problem. Consumer facing software can deal with that.
Plenty of time to figure out the best way, in any case.

Decentralization is less efficient (not inefficient) than centralized systems because there is a certain communication overhead not present in centralized systems. That is the reason it is not as efficient and it has nothing to do with middlemen.
The fact there is risk of prosecution is not a relevant factor by itself, if that were a large enough factor then there would have never been a Silk Road, or Evolution, or anything of that variety of trade.

The proposed solution is limited in that a 51% entity may still filter and exclude transactions at their own discretion. They are forced to include at least some people's transactions, and they would no longer be free to generate completely empty blocks, but they are still in control of the mining process, they would still be able to shut down all other miners, and they could still potentially collapse bitcoin by proving decentralized consensus through proof of work does not work and will tend to centralization given time.

Cryptolocker is an excellent advancement in malware in my opinion.
The folks behind it have a vested interest in making sure people pay up, which means they have a reputation to uphold; people pay and they don't deliver the keys to decrypt locked files, word gets out, reputation destroyed, and no one will pay ever again. Thus; they will provide decryption keys after payment.
The victims are made whole after payment, no data lost, no data stolen (arguably). And as a huge plus: victims now know they are incompetent (an incompetence for which they've had to pay), and got valuable experience from which they may learn in the future.
Compare that to stolen credit card information, victims often remain exactly as incompetent because the bank picks up the tab, they learn nothing and will not proceed to take proper responsibility of their money, or even desire to. I am despised by this behavior and this general ignorance. I'll prefer cryptolocker any day of the week.

If the RNG is compromised the private key can trivially be extracted from any signature you make (assuming you're using a RNG to get *k*, you could use privkey+message for example and be completely safe). Meaning, when you make a transaction your private key can be derived and the transaction double spent before confirmation with a certain chance of success depending on how the network deals with this (ie. first-seen relay policy, double spend flagging, or RBF - allowing double-spends by default) and how well you are connected to the network (fraudster could keep your transaction from propagating).

A blockchain without a token of value will work perfectly fine so long as everyone can either trust a single entity (we'll see how that works out..), or everyone is an honest participant (nope).
But if either of those are the case then.. there's no point in a blockchain, might as well be a traditional database which would be way more efficient.
Without a valuable token to distribute, and without using that token to facilitate decentralized consensus and security, there's no point in a blockchain.
@_date: 2015-04-20 19:15:40


Nope. You are (generally) signing a very specific transaction. You are signing the inputs (where the coins come from) and the outputs (where the coins go), and changing any of that makes the signature invalid for that transaction. The maliciously altered transaction will be invalid and rejected if broadcasted to the network.
None of the information bitcoin sends over the wire is vulnerable to malicious intent, it can be transmitted as-is, without encryption, in the open, for everyone to see.

In 20 years there would be more incentive for miners *to* use RBF *if* they are exceptionally selfish in the short-term and self-destructive in the long-term (which realistically is not unheard of, considering how many banks or other businesses operate currently).
So, let's say miners all implement RBF, and many nodes do aswell (as in, miners mine unconfirmed double spends and nodes would forward them like usual - although that's largely irrelevant, a fraudster or someone wishing to double spend could make sure they are connected to many/most miner nodes and bypass normal network propagation altogether), let's also assume merchants or others wishing to accept zero-conf transactions *would not* like to have a payment double-spent to their disadvantage. They would have little power at this point, seeing that they cannot know (given zero trust) if a transaction is going to be double spent before confirmation, so they will not be able to decide whether they are confident enough to accept a transaction. So what can they do?
- They could only accept zero-conf for payments made through a trusted custodian (ie. Coinbase or Circle) or through a trusted cosigner (ie. GreenAddress) or trusted consumers (ie. Return clients). For all other types they would wait for confirmation(s). (Bad for those wishing to be private or independent of anyone)
- Raise prices to account for added risk (bad for everyone except fraudsters)
- Only allow payments through channels such as the proposed lightning network, bypassing an on-chain transaction entirely (bad for those wishing to settle on the blockchain, albeit arguably unnecessary)
Either way, merchants or others affected by negative side effects of RBF would have options to negate them, but this would come at the cost of restricting different methods of payment, or making them more inconvenient. Bad.
In the end, RBF is very meh in my opinion. If the only reason to implement it is to get transactions with insufficient fees unstuck then it needs to be forwarded to the bin asap. Unfortunately there's little we can do to stop miners from implementing it other than becoming a miner.
@_date: 2015-09-07 23:52:34

That's no proof.
The issue is that your coins will forever remain in the unspent transaction output list. That list is a resource hog for full nodes. The way to solve that is to spend the coins to provably unspendable outputs, such as OP_RETURN outputs.
Signing a message you won't be spending some output isn't proof, it's just a claim you may be lying about.

Well, to be completely clear, changetip could be considered a third party in this case.
@_date: 2015-09-07 18:31:38
A 2-of-3 multisig is typically how you do escrow in bitcoin.
1 key for you, 1 key for the entity you're negotiating a contract with, another for an independent third party acting like a dispute mediator - in this scheme, the third party doesn't every 'hold' any assets, and cannot run away with it.
Another way is to define your contract conditions directly into a transaction and use the peer-to-peer network to resolve your contract. In this case, the palette of conditions is kind of limited in Bitcoin, because you can't use the Bitcoin blockchain to reference anything in the 'real world' deterministically.
More about the concept here: 
@_date: 2015-09-14 15:45:13


Yeah.. This is one of the reasons (the other is privacy) it's so important not to reuse addresses and not to hold any coins in a pay-to-pubkey output (the latter has been pretty much solved going forward, but there are still many historic unspent outputs of such types).
Not reusing addresses and transaction constructs that do not expose the public key inherently mitigate most potential problems with ECDSA.
It might also be a reason this is on the hardfork wishlist (or in my opinion should be):


*(description probably outdated, but point stands)*
@_date: 2015-04-15 12:32:46
It's probably got to do with the common misuse of paper wallets.
Using what's referred to as paper wallets as an actual wallet is a bad idea, somewhat rightly so, they invite you to spend from the same address multiple times, which is bad for security and bad for privacy. I do agree with him the term 'paper wallet' for a BIP38 encrypted private key is poorly chosen.
In addition to that, using a myriad of redundant protective measures on top of this bad practice (tear/heat/water/tamper resistance), and sticking the result in even more redundant containers (bag, another bag, a safe, a secure location) doesn't make it any better in my opinion.

Your argument in today's mail was that SPV would be less reliable, which led to my confusion. If you're SPV, then the latter ('I was fooled by an invalid transaction') will *always* be the case, so I'm not sure I understand how their reliability would be affected in a soft *or* a hard fork - unreliability in that situation is always true.


People started using Bitcoin based on some set of assumptions and expectations. Hard forks can change those assumptions and expectations while soft forks can't.

(Assuming the Stratum protocol)
Some pointers:
- A share is *not* necessarily a valid block - it is a block at a much lower difficulty, if you will, that the pool uses to keep track of your share of the work.
- The pool does not broadcast shares onto the network; it checks if the share is a valid block (valid at sufficient difficulty as indicated in the block headers) and only then will broadcast the block (and send new jobs to the pool participants)
- Pool communication is point-to-point, nothing needs to propagate through it. Each participant in the pool is given jobs that can be completed individually, for which they contribute shares indicating the amount of work they are doing.


Only the pool knows about all shares, each participant knows only about its own shares (whether or not they are valid).
Participants don't even know about the content they are mining - they are given the block to mine on top of, a coinbase transaction and associated merkle branch they can use to roll the extraNonce (updating the merkle root), a difficulty, a time and a version (basically, just the block headers, excluding a specific merkle root - they can compute that themselves using the coinbase + branch)
Using getblocktemplate individual miners can enforce a shared block composition policy, which is far better for decentralization as users - in this model - don't have to 'trust' a pool operator to do the composition for them (and potentially censor a bunch of stuff against the participant's will):
But this has some problems where miners have to do more complex stuff. In the stratum model, mining hardware can be extremely dumb and it'll still work.

I actually don't think there's anything wrong with banks asking a fee to *store* your money. There's no reason for anyone to *give you money*, for holding your money, *if all they're going to do is store and secure it*.
If, though, they lend out that money and profit from the interest over it, I will expect a share of the profits.
Consequently, if they charge me for storing my money with them, I will be demanding that's all they're doing: *storing it.* As a result, said bank would not be vulnerable to a bank run, or an economic collapse, or anything; they will, essentially, have all of the money they're storing in the vault, always (be it digital or otherwise), never having to touch it unless I tell them to.
Presently, it appears we're heading to a situation where they 'charge' negative interest rates over money of customers, *while lending it out and using it for profit*. There is not a reason I could think of for me to be part of this disaster waiting to happen, I demand better.

So let me get this straight, researchers research things, they then typically sell the rights to publish the research to some journal, which then set a high fee to accessing the research, and now people are pirating said research, and making it available to everyone, violating the rights as sold by the researcher.
Sigh. I'm sorry but from an economic perspective this is a moronic situation caused entirely by the researchers themselves selling their _self-affirmed_ intellectual property voluntarily to sharks that are adverse to their interests. This is simply poor decision-making, and Sci-Hub solves it with theft.
Since journals are apparently abusing a market position the result of which is customers being less happy, the superior alternative is to offer a better journal not abusing their market position, thereby making its customers more happy. Not theft. Simple.
(that said, I don't believe in intellectual property to begin with, and don't have a problem with Sci-Hub doing what it's doing, but since these researchers are selling this stuff, affirming its existence as property, to call this whole practice theft, at least from the perspective of the research-publishing-rights-selling-researcher, is entirely accurate)
@_date: 2015-09-04 00:54:25


Yes, I understand that. But I'm very much in doubt of the significance of a single economic participant running a node if they do not understand or appreciate its benefits. (as the former 2 arguments I gave against running a full node would indicate)
For example, back when BIP16 was rolled out (hate to drag this out of the dirt again, but ah) the node count was closer to the all-time high - yet the topic of P2SH was still very much in discussion, and demonstrably better alternatives (yours) were out there. Yet for some reason, through all these beneficial independently operated nodes, the change was rolled out in little time at all. I would venture to guess that even in today's 'all-time low node ratio', that would not have happened. Which would lead me to believe that node count - as a metric in an of itself - is, indeed, meaningless.
Though I would love to be proven wrong.

@_date: 2015-04-20 19:10:45
That's a good question.
The answer is that we don't track time very precisely, because we don't need to have very fine-grained knowledge of what time exactly it is. The bitcoin network is very, very lenient in the time reported in blocks, because a 'rough estimate' will do.
Really, there's only one reason time exists in the blockchain, and that is to recalibrate the network difficulty every 2016 (~2 weeks) so that the network will generate a block every 10 minutes. That, is all.
This isn't a mechanism that requires the time to be very accurate. If it's off by a few hours, a day even, it doesn't really matter all that much. If it's abused even a little (ie. miners 'trick' the network into accepting a lower difficulty by pushing the time variable in the blocks), the difficulty will be higher the next change, and so on. The mining network balances itself exceptionally well.
So, how do we prevent people/miners from *greatly* abusing this variable to their advantage? (remember, if block time deviates a little from the actual time it's not a big problem, if it deviates from the actual time by years, like you mention, it is)
How does the bitcoin network know what time it is? And there's 3 ways, rather, 3 clocks:
(I was looking for an original quote of satoshi about him saying something to the effect of 'you never know what time it is if you have only 2 clocks, so bring 3', but I can't find it.)
1. The timestamp reported in blocks (inaccurate and may be lied about)
2. The time your peers tell you it is, which is the median time of all times reported by your connected peers (reasonably accurate, but may be lied about)
3. Your own clock (accurate and cannot be lied about unless you do not trust yourself)
The first needs no explanation, it's the problem we're trying to solve using the other 2 clocks.
The second. Every time a peer connects to you he will report what time he thinks it is. By taking the median (to exclude those who claim they live in 2020) of the times reported by all peers you will come to some reasonably accurate time the network thinks it is.
The third is your own clock, and most reliable, but for a myriad of reasons (physics, and Einstein's pesky relativity theory, for example) may not be exactly the same reported by the network.
By averaging the second and the third clocks, we create a 'network adjusted time'. This network adjusted time will *never* be adjusted for more than 70 minutes off your own clock. If the network adjusted time is off by &gt;70 minutes, it's a good indicator the network is either exceptionally untruthful, or your own clock is off.
Every time a block comes in, the timestamp reported in the headers must never be more than 2 hours away from the network adjusted time. If it is, the block is invalid and will be discarded by the network.

First of all, we'll be fine for a very, very long time.
But yes you are right, at some point, assuming this crazy thing works out, we'll run out of divisible units.
So, then we'll make it more divisible.
Remember, bitcoin is nothing but a bunch of people agreeing bitcoin exist in some form. These people all play along with the same rules, and they do the same things, which is why the system continues to work.
If, all of the sudden, we all agree a new rule exists, it will be so. The contents of the blockchain may be set in stone, but the protocol - the rules which we all agree on - is not. It changes with consensus of those using it.
Specifically what will happen:
We'll change the block(and/or transaction) format to an incremented version (currently it's version 0x02 for blocks, 0x01 for transaction, we'll make it 0x03 and 0x02 respectively). This new format contains 16 bytes in a transaction's amount field. The last 8 of which represents the increased divisibility.
And presto, we've made bitcoin more divisible.
Note though, it is *extremely* likely this will be a hard fork (I don't see any way we can soft fork this, ie. make it backward compatible, but you never know what these crazy core devs come up with)

^(* *abruptly bridges discussion over to the block size limit debate* *)


If we don't, simple physics will and we'll end up having a centralized system. I'm sure you're aware how terribly unfortunate a broadcast network such as Bitcoin's scales.
Look. I liked your paper, it makes sense to me that the limit can be self-regulated through market forces and miner profitability - block space supply curves and mempool demand curves, awesome, I can even see it work.
But it isn't market forces we're trying to combat here, it's clear technical limitations we would run into head-first long before the market would ever approach your ideal miner surplus region *without ending up in a severely more centralized position*, which, in the end, is what Bitcoin is all about.

You are if you accept incoming connections. (in the Bitcoin Core UI, if the 'connectivity indicator' on the bottom right has a green bar, you're accepting incoming connections. Open up port 8333 on your router and forward it to your machine *if* you want to accept incoming connections)
Otherwise you are running a node which allows you to have more/superior confidence in the state of the network and the blockchain, you are as trustless as you can be. But you will not contribute back to the network as much as you would if you were accepting incoming connections (which is fine).


Even if a transaction were mined in a block, you can never be completely 100% confident a transaction will not be double-spent (or rather, reversed)
In most cases (though not all, such as when miners collude with fraudsters), you *can* be able to see if an unconfirmed transaction is being double-spent because the double-spend will/may (depending on how nodes operate) propagate through the network. Do note that if *you* hold the private keys and you are *not* double spending, you can be as confident your transaction is not being double-spent (in a way it is valid) as your private key is secure. (because you are the only one that can create a valid transaction)


It is doing all of those things, and before propagating transactions (and blocks) it also checks if they are valid (it will discard them if they are not).
@_date: 2015-04-20 14:24:36
This was somewhat implied by "through a lot of effort", since you'd have to be running the SPV node the addresses are being fetched from and have something smart making false positive results from a bloom filter negative (which doesn't appear to be all that hard). But yes you're right.

Spend x (limit) funds to an address you own, unencumbered, spend the remainder to another. Then immediately create a locktime encumbered transaction on that output doing the same (unencumbered limited, and encumbered remainder), then destroy the private key (yeah...).
You can spend the limited amount however you please, and only redeem / reencumber the remainder after the locktime expired.
Again, it's far from practical, but it can be done using only today's conditioning capabilities.

All databases we've had so far have been CRUD. Create, Read, Update, Delete.
I like to think of the Bitcoin blockchain as the first CR database. You can create entries, you can read entries, but you cannot update or delete them.
Removing incentivized and decentralized consensus/mining, which so far has only happened through tokens like bitcoins, will add the U and D right back and you'll be left with the most inefficient distributed database ever.

That's a matter of adoption; after the soft forks are activated a lightning-type network will be possible without permission, regardless of its routing. As you say that'll spin off a discussion on its viability / acceptance, and I agree it'll take some unknown amount of years (although I'm betting on 2 years at the most) before some relatively wide-spread adoption can be observed.


Yeah. That's sort of a chicken-egg kind of situation we're in. I think we can fairly accurately model the way it'll be used and account for a wide variety of possibilities and use very little assumptions, but reality may be completely different.
In any case, I'm pretty confident we'll have a working lightning implementation - albeit at the skeleton level - we can tinker with, allowing us to answer many unknowns, in well under a year.
@_date: 2015-09-11 17:12:32
Exactly. In fact anyone running a Bitcoin Core node and putting their economic stake behind it would make any forks incompatible with the set of consensus rules they enforce increasingly worthless.
A 75%, or whatever percentage, miner agreement to change a consensus rule - a hard fork - is simply not enough to come to consensus in this system.
This has nothing to do with whether or not the limits set in BIP 101 would work or not: the *threshold* is downright irresponsible and dangerous. Even if I were supportive of the limit parameters in BIP 101, the threshold attached to its deployment I would distance myself from immediately.

There's - that I know of - 3 different people/groups creating 3 different implementations and a wide variety of people working on and designing the protocol those implementations should run on. Rusty Russel is probably the most notable person right now, spearheading the ideas put forth by the white paper by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja in the form of a protocol and his C implementation.
The current challenge is to design a way to do routing within the network such that privacy and security is preserved, currently it's looking to be similar to TOR's onion routing.
What's left to be done (off-the-top-of-my-head-short-list):
- Malleability soft fork *(this was mentioned in an old version of the paper, but as far as I'm aware it's no longer needed because the current design never ends up in a situation where you need to depend on someone else's malleable transaction. It's still preferred, but not strictly needed)*
- OP RELATIVECHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY / OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY soft fork - allowing for channels to remain open indefinitely
- Finishing the protocol design
- All of the heavy duty code doing all_the_things
- Probably some protocol specification/docs for wallets to use (although I'd suspect they're already aware of the developments)
- Finishing the implementations, which would be nodes - the 3 mentioned above
- Wallet implementations (unclear)

LN is a proposal by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja, they are not affiliated with Blockstream. The concept they describe is well known for years, though their solution is novel. Many companies/people (including Blockstream) is working on an implementation.
Core developers at Blockstream (and elsewhere, Jeff Garzik's BIP 100 and 102 for example) have several concrete (to lesser and greater degrees) proposal such as Pieter Wuille's BIP 103, Gregory's flexcap, and Adam's 2-4-8 schedule aswell as extension blocks.

No white papers that I'm aware of (apart from the original).
As you say the LN white paper makes little mention of concrete routing - it proposes a sort of top-tier-ISP type of routing, which is tending toward centralization as we've seen happen with the internet. In actuality, the goal now is to create a fully decentralized and private onion-type routing mechanism. As far as I can see they're (Rusty in particular) pretty far along with having the concept fleshed out. I'm having trouble keeping up, in fact.

7 tps is based on the assumption that average transaction size is 250 bytes and blocks are full.
The actual average tx size is over 500 bytes and blocks typically aren't filled to capacity.
More specifically for the current 'stresstest': transactions are much larger because they're sweeping together a bunch of useless dust (they consume many unspent outputs at once), making the maximum txrate that fits in a block significantly lower.

Heh, not necessarily.






I think the general idea is to work toward having a much more modular Bitcoin Core to which extending components such as wallets may be added. Already we're seeing segregation of core functionality into different sheltered off segments: moving libbitcoinconsensus to a different repo, someone created a netstack that's intended to be used as a library rather than be integrated (recent talk at scaling bitcoin), Eric Lombrozo apparently recreated the full software stack into a much more modular approach.
Third party wallets would/could be 'subscribing' to Bitcoin Core indices and events rather than be fully integrated into the product. That'd be hugely beneficial to decentralization 
Check out this thread:
Until then, though, the current wallet is what we're stuck with. (you can point some wallets to exclusively use your full node, though, such as Andreas Schildbach's android wallet)

Proof-of-work is finding a set of data of which the resulting hash, which is, given not-before-seen input, unpredictable (yet deterministic to compute), that has some rare properties, like being an incredibly low number.
In Bitcoin, the number miners are looking for can be described with only about 190 bits (currently) rather the 256 bits most hashes of the same time can ordinarily be described with. In other words, the number starts with a ton of zeroes.
The problem can be made more difficult by lowering (or increasing, to make it easier) the number of bits the number can be described with.
In extreme layman terms, of course ;) (meaning there's some inaccuracies in the above explanation, but it'll do)

To add to this.
The amount put into each output is optimal for their goals (alleged stresstest): the only way to get *any* profit out of this, is to aggregate a shitton of outputs into a single transaction, making that transaction huge - but efficient in terms of size per output, lowering the relative fees - and imposing a massive strain on validators (huge-ass transactions take more time to validate per output)
To top it off, since there's supposedly a lot of different people trying to claim these outputs, the variety of these huge-ass transactions will also be large, making the problem worse. (essentially, people are double-spending since presumably many of the outputs will overlap between swiping transactions)
And to *really* top it all off: XT and RBF nodes will hilariously make the problem even worse because they will happily relay double spends, causing more fruitless validation. (Not saying that's a problem that needs fixing - I happen to support relaying of double spends aswell as RBF (in the longer term) - it's just unfortunate for the moment)

Using the addrindex provided by this fork:
I think it's possible to build an external (HD and performant) wallet with a dependency only on the exposed RPC hook provided by Bitcoin Core and using none of the integrated wallet functionality.

No. To say mining 6 blocks in a row, for a 20% pool, is "really fucking unlikely" is precisely accurate.
@_date: 2015-09-21 22:04:52


Bitcoin works because every participant (fully validating node) is enforcing a set of rules - consensus rules - onto everything that passes through the network. Rules like 'the block hash must be lower than a set difficulty in order to be valid', 'a transaction cannot spend an output that does not exist', 'a transaction cannot have a higher aggregate output amount than its aggregate inputs', 'a transaction's embedded script must, when executed, return true and not throw an error', and so on.
One of these rules, is that every 210 000 blocks, the amount of bitcoins the miner of a block may reward themselves must be halved.
Back when the genesis block was created, the reward was 50 bitcoin for each block that a miner would generate. Approximately 4 years later, when the 210 000th block was generated, this reward was halved to the current 25 bitcoin, and in just a little over 40 000 blocks, the 420 000th block will be generated, at which point the reward will, again, be halved to 12.5 bitcoin.
This reward halving schedule (along with the other consensus rules, like no double spends) is the reason bitcoins are a scarce digital commodity, it is the reason bitcoin has value in the first place. It is modeled much like the way gold is being shoveled out of the ground - this, too, happens at a somewhat predictable rate that is ever-lowering. Gold also has value primarily because it is a scarce commodity.


The block size *limit* is another consensus rule. A block is generated every 10 minutes on average, and that block may - currently - not be larger than 1 megabyte in size. This rule was put in place years ago in order to prevent spam; there was some worry that blocks could become arbitrarily large, which would disallow new participants from validating the system. We are now running into this limit for what appear to be legitimate reasons: the network has grown such that a 1MB block size no longer prevents spam, but presumably prevents legitimate growth. The controversy is about a way to change this limit into something more appropriate, and everyone disagrees over the best way to do this.
It's hard to come to consensus, because the consensus rules we all agree with are the reason bitcoin works the way it does in the first place: we need to all be in agreement in order to change something, and getting to a place where we all agree is not easy. But we're getting there.


Depends on where you're from. I wouldn't know.
@_date: 2015-09-21 18:25:59
You're right - the situation is pretty bleak-looking at the moment.
But I, for one, am hopeful we can improve this in the future when/if 'decentralized ownership' ever becomes a reality. That would allow 'cloud mining' to not always be a total scam: Essentially, it could let you, and you alone, provably *own* a piece of mining equipment running in some far-off data center, enjoying the same highly efficient cooling and cheap electricity the big mining boys currently do. You will be able to set the block composition policies yourself - not defer it to a pool, and verify the machine is doing what you're telling it to do.
I suspect it'll be possible for anyone to do that at a very slight loss, and starting from a very small scale - because the reasons for doing this are presumably not entirely financial, but in part also altruistic in nature - to decentralize the system and add value to it that way, which is great.
Currently, any such altruistic motives would require you to invest hundreds of thousands in mining equipment and potentially lose all of it - I know of very few altruists who are willing to do that, or more specifically: none.

-txindex validates everything starting from 0 if I recall correctly (don't remember where I read that, but I suppose it makes some sense) - that'll also (well, primarily) give you a full index of every transaction ever (allows you to query everything, otherwise you can only query unspent outputs)
I can't readily find which options will only do a full validation. I suppose some combination of -checkblocks=0 (check everything) and -checklevel=3 (I think 3 validates the most, not sure) would do the trick, but don't pin me on that.

In my experience asking people, it's because they either find more convenience in an SPV wallet - quite understandably; SPV is more convenient even at the lowest of conceivable limits. Or because they're prepared to trust others or 'the network' to do validation for them, also somewhat understandably; the number of times there have been failures in bitcoin's history need but a single hand to be counted.
And those who say "I don't wanna go through the trouble of doing an IBD and maintaining a machine" usually have either one or both of the above objections in addition to that.
That said, though I understand their reasoning, these are people who have no idea of the advantages a full node can give them (or how a well and independently operated node helps the network decentralise further), and I doubt they could enjoy the benefits even if they did. But let's say that for some reason, let's say it's a 4 second IBD, they did spin up a Bitcoin Core instance, would the network benefit from these people running a node like the drone that they are? No.
Node count, if you ask me, is a poor indicator for much of anything.

Not quite. Loss of currency is effectively economic contraction: *deflation without an increase in efficiency*, which affects, for example, a debtor's ability to pay off a bitcoin denominated debt. (Which arguably is a bad denomination to have debt in in the first place, at least for now)

That's the Base 58 WIF (Wallet Import Format) encoding, all it's encoding is a 256 bit number.
From  :


So the private key space is just under 2^256


All private keys reside within the private key space (any natural number between 1 and the number above). The limit is the space, and every private key is 'known' or 'given away' in the sense that they are known to exist within that space. The space is far (far far far) too large to search, though.


A typical microSD drive can contain 64GB worth of data. One of such drives can contain 2 x 10^9 (2 billion) private keys (at 256 bits each).
So to store all possible private keys (not public keys or addresses) would require roughly 5.7 x 10^67 of those SD drives.
For reference, there's about 10^18 grains of sand here on earth, and there's on the order of 10^80 atoms in the universe. So you need *[somewhere in between]* the amount of SD drives.
A single SD drive is about 1mm in height. So if you were to stack all of these on top of eachother, **your stack of SD cards will be roughly 6.5 x 10^37 times larger than *the diameter of the universe*.**
And that's only storing the private keys. And disregarding the computation required to get those numbers *on* the SD cards, let alone the computation required to search for collisions in the blockchain.
// Edit:
Perhaps a more apt analogy: A single SD card weighs about 2 grams. If you were to stack these SD cards in a cuboid, its total mass would be 5.7 x 10^34 times *larger than our sun* (assuming you can get the raw materials to build the things, of course). The sun would collapse into a black hole if it were mere 8 times more massive - this stack of SD cards is slightly more massive than that (by 30 odd more magnitudes) - so it would immediately collapse into a black hole. It would also be the most massive black hole our milky way or probably the universe has ever seen, by another 20 or so magnitudes. So I guess it's pretty safe to say we won't be storing the entirety of private keys any time soon.
So yeah.
@_date: 2015-09-28 19:27:10

Since headers-first it's possible to download multiple blocks at the same time because the best chain is known before syncing blocks with the network.
Specifically, block headers will be downloaded first (~30MB or so), which allows you to identify which chain is the best / correct one, and to query specific blocks along the chain from multiple peers concurrently (although I'm not sure it's *actually* fetching from multiple peers).
Previously, your node would be completely blind as to what it's fetching until the block had been fully validated, so you could only download 1 block at a time
*Previous sequential TL;DR:* repeat[download, validate, admit/reject, proceed to next block], done
*Current concurrent TLD;DR:* download headers, identify chain repeatConcurrent[download shitton of blocks, validate when you have time], done

Adam Back proposed a 2-&gt;4-&gt;8MB increase in the next 3 years, and reevaluate from there.
It's called a compromise. Even if a higher block size demonstrably has negative effects on decentralization (increased cost on nodes, further skewing of mining incentives, etc.), I think it's fair to say a majority is willing to bear those effects. The issue now is to locate a suitable compromise, and an agreeable way forward. His proposal, to me, seems like a step in that direction. No need to assume ill intent right off the bat for no reason.

On-point, though. Scalability of, for example, the bubble sort algorithm is O(n) in the best case, and O(n^2) in the worst. Based on the usage expectation that a given input is sorta-sorted, one may choose to use bubblesort rather than quicksort.
(Note here that the scalability observation can be made based solely on the bubblesort algorithm, not on the way it is used - so this isn't an argument against yours. But it's something to consider)

I did some querying on mah node with a swiping thing I've written, and as it appears: projected profits to swiping these addresses are essentially negligible.
First of all, many outputs belonging to those addresses have already been spent. (many people are swiping, or trying to) Each address has a little over a thousand outputs 'in its name', most of which have been spent.
As far as I can see these coins are segregated into outputs of 0.0001 BTC (~2 cents) each, meaning it will cost roughly the same amount in fees to include those outputs in a spending transaction.
Swiping transactions will be huge, containing hundreds of inputs and a single output. They will take a long while to validate, and would put quite a strain on network validation capacity aswell as bandwidth (albeit probably to a lesser degree).
The net result of this, unless there are any larger non-dust outputs I'm missing, will be ~0 profit for anyone trying to swipe these outputs, roughly the full amount spent to miners in the form of fees, and an increased strain on auditors/validators of the blockchain.
Also, there's no reason for miners not to re-sign any transactions 'swipers' are broadcasting to their own output, since the private key is known. (they can do it for free)
As a positive, the UTXO set will be smaller when this shitstorm has passed.

Luke-jr is the odd one in the bunch, and stubborn, sure. But to his credit, he is seldom wrong.
^((on technical matters, that is, don't want to open a can of worms concerning a whole 'nother field of interest)^)
He is (as far as I'm aware) the only core dev that still mines, and has developed and employs the (again, as far as I'm aware) most advanced block assembly policies of all the miners out there. And although at least some of these 'techniques' were/are kind of controversial, it's pretty safe to say he has significant experience with mining 'down in the trenches'.
The view expressed in the OP, I think, is coming from the argument that much of the transactions in blocks that are *currently* being mined, are spam. This spam is irreversibly being appended to the blockchain, and the root cause is the absence of advanced anti-spam features enforced by miners (like the one his pool enforces and is continually improving), along with the absence of a 'healthy' fee market - and this is believed to be bad. The argument has merit.
Lowering the block size limit 'forces' miners to select the transactions they are sticking in their block more carefully (thereby maximizing utility provided per admitted transaction), aswell as bring a more functional fee market into existence. This solution, likewise, has merit.
I don't particularly agree the block size needs to go down, now or ever, but I sort of get where he's coming from.

Don't know about bits of proof, but this block explorer doesn't keep any of its own indexes. It's fully depending on Bitcoin Core's JSON-RPC interface to get the data.
It's meant to be highly maintainable, which I usually interpret as doing as little as possible, as modularly as possible, and with as little dependencies as possible.
With the exception of address balance lookups (which require many gettxout calls) - latency is not much more than that of the JSON-RPC interface: ~&lt; milliseconds.

The reasons you state is that the bitcoin network is inefficient because mining is costly. Which does not even make sense.
Then you proceed to give arguments regarding effectiveness instead of efficiency, which is another thing entirely.
But ok.
Running a store in OB is not like running a website. The data required for a store is shared between peers: chop off one head, and it will be replaced by another. It wouldn't be very decentralized otherwise. You do not shut down a storefront by shutting down the node (assuming this is trivial, which it isn't), you shut it down by finding the person running it and prosecuting them in a court of law, which works only when the goods that are being sold are illegal and that person is in the same legal jurisdiction in which it is illegal (do note that there are people in existence outside the US of A)
In addition to that, OB is borderless, permissionless and frictionless. It is open and free. There are people in this world that care about that.

@_date: 2015-09-20 16:21:18
I have to wonder, though..
If a miner is being paid directly (out of band) to include zero-fee transactions in his microblocks, then at some point there is no reason for the next miner not to just ignore his microblocks and mine at the earliest point in the chain that pays them. In which case everyone who paid the previous miner out of band will have their transaction reversed (and possibly unlikely to be included again, as it's zero-fee). Wouldn't that provide enough of an incentive for a miner to include only (or mostly) the normal variety of fee-paying transactions?
You probably can't eliminate fee sniping entirely under this incentive, but at *some* point there's little reason left for the next miner to include all of the previous miner's microblocks, right? It's like paying increasingly less money to give the previous miner an increasingly painful slap on the wrist.
@_date: 2015-09-07 10:55:46
A common question, and probably an unclear answer :(
The way core developers reach consensus is vague. For one, because the term 'core developer' is not well defined: are these the people who have commit access? Are these the people who contribute code? Are these the people that review proposals, or critique contributions? All or none of the above? And who gets to decide who's a core developer anyway? Vague.
Secondly, assuming the group of 'core developers' is known, how do you measure consensus among them? Voting? ACK/NACK? Vetoes, politics, crying out on Twitter? Where does discussion happen, how is this discussion kept on-topic, on-target, how is the result of a discussion objectively measured? This, too, is not well defined.
Third, assuming some means of measuring consensus is known, how is the case where a proposal which has not reached consensus, but must critically be solved in some perceived timeframe, handled? (the block size limit, for example) Is consensus bypassed? Is progress stagnated? What?
So, none of these have very well defined answers. But note that I'm not saying this is necessarily a problem.
There's a de-facto process one can observe. And I'll try to keep it short (mainly because I'll get it wrong in the details ;) )
First, you need to divide consensus critical changes with all the rest.
Consensus critical changes are the ones that touch any consensus-related code. These changes are handled with much more scrutiny than all the rest, meaning more testing, more eyes that review it, and more discussion related to it. If there is contention on this issue either on GitHub, or the mailing list, or IRC, or wherever else well-founded scientific discussion on an implementation may take place, then the issue is generally not merged into the code base until the contention is resolved.
Wladimir van der Laan is the lead developer currently, so he'll generally merge these issues after discussion is over (or more precisely, objecting positions have somewhat objectively from a perspective of computer science been mitigated or resolved - and the general sentiment in the places of discussion is such that the issue is ready to be merged (which could be very subjective)). He's made it a point that he does not merge any consensus critical code for which he does not believe this is the case. Note, though, that he is not the 'key' you are looking for - I don't believe such a key exists. 
Changes like these always (as far as I'm aware) come with a BIP:
'All the rest' are changes to everything else, these are changes like code architecture, general improvements to the way bitcoin core does things, like better address / peer discovery / management, headers-first and pruning, code formatting, json-rpc stuff, docs, etc. etc. - This is code that enjoys less scrutiny and experiences generally less contention. Consensus is not explicitly needed because the changes are either uncontroversial, generally considered 'good' - no matter how you look at it, and safe for the network. The lead developer can drop the hammer on these and acts like the 'benevolent dictator' if there is no clear consensus here. Which is safe, because none of these changes are consensus critical.
Personally, I think the way Bitcoin Core makes changes is fine. I don't particularly like the idea of a 'benevolent dictator' making changes to consensus critical code if there is contention on the issue; I like to believe the reason for contention is a scientific disagreement rather than a political one, and I like to think a scientific disagreement may always be resolved given proper discussion - which is also a big reason to try and (possibly fruitlessly) avoid making political changes (or rather, decisions - ie. changes not coming from a technical perspective) on the bitcoin protocol.

Looking at the code, orphans are transactions that do not have a known parent (yet). Ie. one of its inputs does not exist in the UTXO set.

Yes, there may still be some slight extra latency getting your valid block solution out of mainland China due to the GFW - but this allows sort-of O(1) block propagation between the sluggish side of the network (where a pool's miners are mining) and the swift side of the network (HK pool operator), which would greatly benefit full propagation.

Bitcoin's value proposition is its being decentralised. Lift that cap, and you will much more easily put yourself in a situation where its decentralisation may no longer be true.
For Bitcoin to be decentralised you need, among other things, many independent auditors of the system.
To 'scale' Bitcoin to the levels you seem to imply, would mean the number of independent auditors putting economic 'flesh' behind their auditing, making the system more decentralised, would drop to levels where Bitcoin would be magnitudes more centralised than is the case today. The reason for this is quite simple: Bitcoin *doesn't* scale *well*; add capacity linearly and you will impose increased cost expended by the system exponentially.
I don't know why you would think that the premise for this debate is simply false? You aren't providing any reason to back that position, so I'm having a tough time believing you on your word. Perhaps you could help yourself and others to understand your position by researching its validity and sharing your results?
Then again, *not* validating a logic system appears to be something you are entirely comfortable with, so my request may just be fruitless. /s

The block size debate is irrelevant to this discussion, although it is getting more obvious what you are sublinearly arguing for.
Groupthink *is* something this network attracts, I suppose. Considering is as much an echo chamber as and bitcointalk.org is as much an echo chamber as bitco.in, it's hard to determine which 'side' of the 'groupthink' to blindly align with, so as you say, technical arguments and scientific analysis remain the objective truth here.
Until those arguments and analyses conflict because the goalposts of either 'side' no longer align. I think this is where we find ourselves currently - and I'm not sure how to claw out of it.


If you feel that is insufficient then you can push a more abrasive measure into XT.


I get the simplicity sentiment, but Version Bits is complexity that's gonna be in the protocol one way or another - whether it's signaling for a hard fork or a soft fork. Hell, XT is using it to roll out a hard fork. We need *some* way to signal for generic upgrades, do we not?

Yes. This is the most important objection to his (in my opinion impressive) paper, making it, frankly, infeasible. I would venture to make a common-sense guess that the resulting 'maximum-profit' block size could very easily become far higher than what nodes - in the way they exist today - could ever hope to validate.


Well, to be fair, he said 2 (large) mining pools would be the minimum required to make his theory hold.


In addition to that, IBLT would also require miners to run the same or a roughly equivalent mempool policy, potentially causing centralization into a single policy.
But regardless, I don't think IBLT or some equivalent technology that can reduce orphans is something we should, or can, or want to actively avoid; miners are currently SPV mining (well, many, and possibly only in the first few seconds to minutes until they've properly validated - as the july 4th fork showed) to minimize orphans and maximize profits - this is possibly the worst way to build on the 'best' chain one could imagine. I would much rather they use constant-time block propagation technologies to minimize orphans than resort to SPV mining.
There was another talk about doing this, but *without* explicitly organized similar mempool policies by Rusty Russel:

If the ECDSA algorithm is compromised then we have kind of a big problem.
I'm unaware of any specific contingencies in place in the case ECDSA / secp256k1 is broken. But here's some thoughts.
First, some observations regarding ways it'll impact the current situation/distribution of unspent outputs, and ways to recover funds on top of a broken algorithm:
1. Many existing/old unspent outputs are of the pay-to-pubkey variety, meaning they have their public key exposed.
2. Addresses that are being reused (ie. have been spent previously) also have their public key exposed and at least one signature.
3. An unspent pay-to-pubkey-hash output is secure in that the pubkey is hashed (harder to compromise), but will have their public key exposed when that output is being spent, in which case there's still a (considerable) vulnerability so long as the spending transaction hasn't been sufficiently confirmed.
I believe there's 4 general ways ECDSA can be broken (to be clearer, I don't believe any of these ways are disproven, and I'm unaware of any other ways - barring R leakage/reuse because I don't consider that broken):
1. The private key may be derived from the public key (terrible)
2. The private key may be derived from a signature (terrible, but not as terrible)
3. A signature may be forged from the public key (bad, but not terrible)
4. A signature may be forged from another signature (bad, but far from terrible)
Some of these have possibilities for allowing us to recover funds to the rightful owner.
In option 1. We'd be fucked. We could opt to make all outputs for which the public key is known unspendable through a soft fork. This would keep the funds from being stolen, but also prohibits the legitimate owner from accessing it. Effectively, we'd be destroying a fair deal of the economy.
This (demurrage) would be controversial - but considering the alternative it might be the lesser of evils:


For pay-to-pubkey-hash outputs (for which the address hasn't been reused) we could still recover the funds with some trickery. First, freeze all pay-to-pubkey-hash outputs in a softfork, then require owners of funds to publish a commitment in which they prove they own the private key (basically, just sign a desired output script (or its hash) and stick it in an OP_RETURN output or something). Then, after sufficient confirmations on the commitment, they spend their pay-to-pubkey-hash output in which they reference that commitment - this spend would only be valid if the output and signature in the commitment matches. That'd fix double-spending a pay-to-pubkey-hash spend as the network transitions to a new system. But it's ugly.
In option 2. We'd also be fucked. The demurrage option may still be used, but restricted to apply only to reused addresses. Unspent outputs for which the public key is known may also be recovered using the above commitment scheme.
In option 3 and 4. We could recover all funds by freezing all outputs it affects (reused addresses and/or pubkey exposed addresses) and using the commitment scheme. Except instead of committing a signature, you'd be leaking the actual private key into the commitment - as in this case the signatures would be compromised.
As for actual migration to another signature algorithm.
This would actually be rather trivial I believe. By simply adding extra behaviour to the OP_CHECKSIG operation (or using a placeholder opcode) and using that in a soft-forkable output template to do a Schnorr signature check rather than a secp256k1 one, we'd be done. This would be a soft fork that could be rolled out pretty fast if the implementation is there. Wallets, however, would all need to updated.
Regardless of what happens. The economy would very probably be totally wrecked after an event like this (especially if the news that ECDSA is compromised would hit us out of the blue). Luckily, ECDSA is an algorithm family that's built on top of some very strong assumptions. I personally don't see it ever breaking in a significant way.

Rural areas (cities of up to a few ten thousand people) have been a huge nono in my experience.

It's being taxed as capital gains, and the gains are assumed to be ~4% (regardless of the actual gains), 30% of which is tax.
Since in Bitcoin-terms, there are no gains (hodl 100 btc for 1 year, and you'll have 100 btc by the end), you'll lose 1.2% of your bitcoins per year.

Let me preface by saying that the notion of TPS being accurate or relevant is a dubious one.
TPS will theoretically be arbitrarily high; transactional capacity does not have bounds when Lightning comes into play and channels are open.
With the Lightning Network around, the question changes to "How many users can Bitcoin support [that can each transact arbitrarily often]?"
So, assuming full segwit adoption, schnorr adoption, full blocks etc. etc. etc. let's say we can do 6 TPS, and people use Bitcoin twice a year to open and close a Lightning channel.
At this point, the network supports ~94608000 or 94 million users.


Probably yes at some point, but with the above improvements deployed, there will be a lot of time to change and expand the existing infrastructure to ready ourselves for doing that.

Using  and what mah nodes are telling me for this:

Usually, the txrate is around 2 tx/s.

Oddly enough, fees per kb dropped 10-fold (some pretty dumb swiping I would assume).

Here's an ELI17:
Both (types of) consensus algorithms are approaches to a way for a decentralised network, a network that knows no leader, or arbiter, or decision maker, to produce a collectively and globally agreed-upon state.
In the case of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, this state is commonly called the 'ledger'.
The approach taken by Proof-of-Work algorithms is for the network to come up with hard-to-produce and easy-to-verify proofs. Typically, this is done by having the network run a hash function (a one-way function which given arbitrary/never-before-seen input has 'unpredictable' and deterministic output) on some piece of data that can uniquely change in some way, and require that the resulting hash satisfy some condition in order for the network to 'consider' it valid. By making this condition hard to satisfy, users who want to produce a valid output must perform 'a lot' of work in order to 'find' one.
Performing this 'work' means consuming something (typically electricity) in the real-world where there is real cost to everything you do. Because a real-world thing is consumed, this means it has effectively been committed to making a decision, namely: producing work for a certain, well-defined, state of the ledger. Which, because this is a real-world thing, can only be done once.
The Proof-of-Stake approach instead requires its miners to produce a proof that they own some stake in the network. Considering these networks typically have some form of token - a currency - defined in their agreed-upon state, and are tracking ownership of these tokens with that state, such a proof is, in principle, trivial to produce [for the actual owners].
On paper, and without closer inspection, Proof-of-Stake seems like a superior strategy, because it seems we can achieve the same result of coming to globally agreed-upon consensus at far lower cost.
However, in Proof-of-Stake, the thing required to produce the proof, is _internal_ to the system it intends to commit proof to. Unlike proof-of-work, where the thing required to produce the proof (a real-world thing that must be consumed) is _external_ to the system. It turns out this fundamental distinction is sort of detrimental to the Proof-of-Stake approach, which leaves its security model at a fundamentally weaker position than the more robust Proof-of-Work alternative. Problems like the nothing-at-stake problem occur, where there is no reason for miners to commit their proof to one chain or another. Or problems like the long-range-attack, where solutions that solve the previous problem (by introducing penalties for committing proofs to multiple chains) end up weakening the chain's past security as the network moves forward (contrary to Bitcoin, where the past only becomes more and more set in stone).
In the end, after due analysis of both approaches, the conclusion is as follows:
Proof-of-Work algorithms produce an objective view of the past and its integrity because at any point in time, regardless of whether any given observer was around at that time or not, a known amount of work has been performed with the intention to further the version of the past you are looking at.
Proof-of-Stake algorithms produce a subjective view of the past and its integrity because at only the points in time where the observer was observing, or the miners were not yet rewarded, is a known amount of stake committed with the intention to further the version of the past you are looking at, _and only that version_.
Which can further be distilled as such:
Proof-of-Work is secure so long as the network is in use (which, arguably, is always), Proof-of-Stake is secure so long as you are looking at it, and not before.

    "It’s worth noting that Satoshi did not use the phrase “hard fork”; presumably the notion that any other kind of fork might exist didn’t occur to him"
But anyway.




You must understand you're debating against yourself.




If you're worried about participants not upgrading then you should be especially wary of hard forks. A hard fork would cause unupgraded participants to remain in an unresolved state based on their incompatible ruleset for longer.
However, I suppose that what you're trying to accomplish by narrowing existing rules through a hard fork, while a soft fork is possible, is that unupgraded participants are at least aware and receive a strong signal a fork has occurred and they should upgrade.
That's fine. Version bits allows for that to happen with any planned soft fork, does it not? Would that not resolve your issue with this particular problem? I didn't see this in your list of ways to resolve your objection.




The soft fork upgrade you described does not let some guy arbitrarily create money from nothing - this is what a hard fork can allow happen. This upgrade would let a single person spend existing - and perceived to be spendable - money while others can't. Not the same.
But regardless, I would think the rollout of such an upgrade be referred to as a 51% attack, not a soft fork. The system is vulnerable to this in any case. What's protecting the system from the feared only-ruler-can-spend-backward-compatible-output-upgrade is the economic majority being against it and majority of miners being honest, not whether or not we use soft forks or hard forks to roll out an upgrade. And in any case, even with this 'upgrade', not a single rule or expectation or assumption is technically broken under the existing model.
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:57:15
Well the solution is already found.
What I proposed (= what many others have proposed before) is an update that will not trigger an actual hard fork until the value maxes out - meaning existing hardware doesn't need to be changed (assuming existing hardware won't last 90 years), other hardware (such as miners) doesn't need to be changed at all (they either don't care about the meaning of the timestamp, or ignore it completely), and we have 90 years to progressively roll out the update to hardware/software that does care about it (full nodes, primarily)
No need to turn this value into 8 bytes through a *hard-cut* hard fork, which would require *everything* to upgrade at some point before 2106 when more easy-going solutions are available.

Fuck knows.
But here's how it can be made backward compatible/softfork with a new opcode. If you're familiar with the scripting system...
A P2SH transaction is of the format:
scriptpubkey: OP_HASH160 [20-byte-hash-of-a-script] OP_EQUALVERIFY
which is valid all the way down to v0.1 if you can provide some scriptsig which, if hashed, resolves to the 20-byte hash in the output.
For clients/nodes (and all miners) that understand P2SH, the supplied scriptsig is also interpreted and executed like a normal scriptpubkey, with all operations before it as the scriptsig, before it is considered valid. This is how it's made backward compatible.
For sidechains it's probably gonna be something like:
scriptpubkey: OP_TRUE [somethingsomething] OP_NEW_FANCY_SIDECHAIN_OPCODE_VERIFY [voodoo] OP_MORE_VOODOO
which, like in P2SH, will be valid for all clients down to v0.1 (OP_TRUE makes it valid, and everything else is /care)
For clients that understand sidechains, this type/template will be given a different meaning. It could be interpreted in some way we don't yet know about which 'locks/destroys?/beams-them-over-to-the-sidechain' them until some other transactions 'unlocks/undestroys/unbeams' it back.

to send funds. An output fee can be added to create an incentive for this
third party to watch the network. Further, this can also be mitigated by
implementing relative OP CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.

I should add, both of these risks are said to be mitigated by third parties, which may scare some people.

The difficulty adjustment frequency (it being 2 weeks) has nothing to do with price spreculation and everything to do with network security.
If the difficulty were to adjust every, say, 144 blocks (about a day) it would be less costly to shield your node from the real bitcoin network and cause you to believe a parralel dishonest chain is honest. I, as an attacker, only have to generate 144 blocks at a reasonable (but not necessarily large) chunk of the network hashrate and, feed them to you, make sure you are not connected to the honest network, and you would never notice a thing wrong in the world.

The peaceful assumptions of BIP9 may be too presumptious for future soft fork releases; a 95% honest/cooperative miner distribution may be too optimistic.

Most node operators will be fine for some 10 years (although half of asia will be cut off from the get-go), maybe, then boom, the limit goes off to the realm of implausible. If block sizes actually start to come near that limit at that time, and it's only reasonable to make that assumption, then Bitcoin is running head-first into a time of centralisation like we've never seen before, and it can potentially only get worse for at least the next 20 years.

Forward compatibility allows software to understand future versions of inputs, which simply isn't true for soft forks.

Prepare to be shocked.
I'm thinking 6 months for the required soft fork update to be rolled out (maybe before year's end), for it to be deployed and active on the bitcoin blockchain .. I'd say may '16.
In the coming 1-8 months I think we'll see many working lightning implementations popping up on the Alpha sidechain. Walllets will also start some rudimentary development of a lightning hook when the nodes pop up.
After the soft fork activation on the bitcoin chain I fully expect the lightning network to be ready for deployment. Wallets would probably lag terribly, however, and I don't think we'll see fancy UX or adoption as a payment network for another year or 2 or longer (similar to P2SH) - but I'd like to be surprised.

Miners are perfectly capable of deciding what to include in their own block.

Let's first touch on the primary reason pools exist:
They allow you to mine bitcoin and be paid at more regular intervals.
When you're solo-mining with a few machines in your basement, you'll generate a block once every few *years* or so. This isn't very useful if you have electricity bills to pay, and you have no idea when you find the next block. Joining a large pool has the significant benefit of ensuring regular payments at your share of the hashrate, thereby allowing you to have more certainty over the current and future sustainability of your mining operation.
In principle, pools are a sensible thing to have.
Most pools (//edit: actually, I'm not too sure if this is still the prevalent mining protocol on the network) are run by a single centralised operator, and people that contribute hashpower to it typically have no idea what they are mining, nor do they have any control over it other than by leaving; the transaction selection policy these pools are running is at the sole discretion of the pool operator. This is the Stratum mining protocol (on top of getwork). It's very efficient, very quick, very easy to set up. But it's tending toward centralisation into pools that might aswell be treated as a single corruptible miner (ie. GHash.io), because contributors have no control. So all-in-all, as far as decentralisation goes, this isn't great.
There's also the 'getblocktemplate' variety of mining. This allows miners to choose their own transaction selection policy. For this reason, it doesn't tend toward centralisation in the same way Stratum/getwork mining does, because miners participating in a pool that runs this protocol do not submit to the pool operator's whim. But it's harder to set-up and not as accessible to dumb miners in the same way Startum/getwork is. If all pool mining were done via getblocktemplate, then that would be fantastic for decentralisation.
Third, there's P2Pool. This allows participants to contribute mining power, have gradual and frequent payouts, and have *full control* over the transaction selection policy. As far as individual/independent control goes, it's excellent. But you need to run a full node to use it - which, to some miners, is a barrier (because they're lazy). Also, if you're merged mining, then you need to run nodes for each chain you're merge-mining. It isn't plug-and-play like the alternatives.
There's also the problem where P2Pool *itself* can be 51% attacked: P2Pool is essentially another blockchain that, instead of bitcoin-transferring-transactions, contains shares which represent some amount of work. This allows the pool to reward the owners of shares some amount of bitcoin (when this pool finds a block) in a way it's decentralized - but, exactly like bitcoin, this is vulnerable to a 51% attack because some majority miner on this pool can rewrite history and make everyone elses contributions useless. P2Pool can never solve the 51% problem even if 100% of miners are on it for this reason.
Also, for various reasons, P2Pool has a slightly higher orphan rate than centralized pools have - because centralized pools can run a more efficient operation.


See this response by G. Maxwell:


Bear in mind miners operate on vapor thin margins - a day's worth of pointless mining is *very* costly.
Also, if everyone is on p2pool then that isn't all that great; p2pool runs a 30-second sharechain that's essentially the same as Bitcoin's, but with lower difficulty - if everyone runs on this pool then, essentially, this increases payout frequency by only 20 compared to solo-mining. Also, you'll have an output for every contributing miner in every single coinbase of every single block, for example (which, admittedly, isn't all that bad if everyone is on this pool). And it doesn't solve any fundamental majority-miner problem.
Personally, widespread pooled mining through getblocktemplate rather than Stratum - I think - would already be a huge step in the right direction.

The difference between typical libertarians and anarchists (of the ancap variety) is that ancaps want to privatise the courts, not abolish them. (Rereading, to clarify: libertarians typically don't want to abolish the courts, but keep them public, albeit highly restricted, in the hands of the state. Ancaps want to explicitly deny the state the right to institutionalise their monopoly on violence in that way fully, by privatising the courts)

What curious analogy.
@_date: 2015-11-09 13:15:31
What's *valid* is determined *only* by the consensus rules on transaction validity:
- Whether a transaction's scripts evaluate to 'true'
- Whether a transaction spends coins that do not exist
- Whether a transaction spends coins that have already been spent (conflates with the above; coins that have been spent, for all intents and purposes, do not exist any longer)
The block size limit is a *block* validation rule, it has no bearing on *transaction* validity.
However, since miners are believed and intended to act rational in their own selfish economic interests, it makes sense to say that transactions that pay them more are given higher priority. In the situation where blocks are filling up, lower priority transactions are omitted and remain in the mempool, waiting for a future block to include it.
It's true that a higher block size limit may allow for these lower priority transactions to be included. It's *not* true that it fixes transactions like this being stuck; in this case, Coinbase is responsible for getting the transaction in a block. They can do that by paying a high enough fee. If that, as is the case here, fails, there need to be tools available that allows Coinbase to correct it; RBF and CPFP.

I think most developers realized some time ago that discussion is becoming increasingly worthless - especially here on Reddit, where nuance and grown-up discourse is something so far gone we hardly know the meaning of the concept.
Gavin, Gregory, Mike, Pieter - they've all left, and the ones that dare show up do so sporadically and with great care. And for good reason.
They've moved on to doing actual useful work, such as rolling out libsecp256k1 (in 0.12), BIP 65/CLTV (recent release), reviewing BIP 112/CSV (maybe in a few months), fixing low-s malleability, managing the mempool, gathering and analysing mining centralisation trends (ie. Gregory's recently presented work at DevCore regarding mean actual miner bandwidth and latency), writing/implementing proposals to changing the block size limit, and much more.
Concretely with regards to the holy block size debate. I hear Jeff is presenting 3 separate implementations of existing BIPs, Gregory is proposing a solution, and some others too:


And, noteworthy: Luke-Jr, of all people, was the one to suggest discussing a hard fork in last week's IRC dev meeting.

Segregated Witness is a proposal I would rather see happen as a hard fork. It's the most/only robust solution, and hard forking it is sane and reasonable.
The soft fork requires, as far as I can tell, the normalized SW-style txids to be committed in a merkle structure inside the block. (The last transaction, I suppose, for ease of recalculating the merkle root)
This is terrible complexity to have in the protocol, I reckon, and I think it might just be better to bite the bullet on this one, and schedule its deployment in a hard fork 2 or so years from now.

A proof of the funds being frozen on the Bitcoin main chain will cause the consensus model of the sidechain to call coins on the sidechain to come into existence. In short: everyone agrees Bitcoin funds were frozen, following proof of that, they agree money can be created on the sidechain.
To move sidechain-coins 'back' to the Bitcoin mainnet requires the coins to be destroyed on the sidechain. Proof of this destruction will then be enough to un-freeze frozen coins on the Bitcoin mainnet. This latter proof is, in essence, an SPV proof. In order to be fully confident of its truthfulness requires a validator/auditor to follow and fully validate both Bitcoin mainnet aswell as the sidechain.


The peg defines the 'exchange rate' between the 2 coins deterministically. It's possible for a sidechain to have an entirely different monetary model; you can have one that is inflationary, or one that has demurrage, or whatever you can think of. Noteworthy here is that before you're converting Bitcoins to the sidechain-coin, you'll know, exactly, what this rate is or will be. So it's entirely opt-in.

It's a centralised service so bear in mind you'll always be at their mercy.
The probable solution would be for them to double spend the transaction with a higher fee.
Alternatively, if the recipient is using a normal wallet where the private keys are available, he could also spend it with a high fee, in which case child-pays-for-parent might kick in. The recipient's wallet probably doesn't allow for this out of the box, so he'd have to construct a transaction using the privkey in Bitcoin Core or similar. Will be technically more difficult, so this is likely not a good solution at all.

libsecp256k1 is probably the best tested library introduced to bitcoin so far.
And for good reason, it handles all signature validations, so it not having *any* bugs is crucial. While testing (against OpenSSL - the current signature validation library) this library actually revealed 2 bugs in the OpenSSL library (!) which have been elevated and fixed in OpenSSL. The final product is far superior to OpenSSL, better performance, better resistance against sidechannel attacks, and far, far better tested.
See this recent talk (at ~21.37 minutes):
Most testing and vetting has taken place separately in libsecp256k1's repository and elsewhere, rather than the PR that only merges it into Bitcoin's repo. This vetting process alone has taken well over a year, and has been exceptionally extensive - the effort to creating this library started way back in 2011 and was first described / worked on by Hal Finney.

The only thing you have to go on is that not most of them are corrupted scumbags.


Yep, and yes, it would make sense for them to implement reversibility or some other consolidation type of thing on an individual transaction basis.
The primary benefit here is not irreversibility of events, but auditability. Say banks: a, b, c, d, x, y, z take part in a permissioned inter-bank blockchain sort-of system in a 5-of-7 consensus construct. In order for the system to function, any 5 of those banks need to be in agreement. So long as any 5 of those banks agree, anything can happen. So long as any 5 of them agree *and are honest*, is the system secure.
However, any one of those banks *and any outside observer* may continually audit the system at any time, and evaluate its objectivity. It isn't bitcoin, but it's a major step up from existing clearing houses. So any outside observer may see, and show, to what extent - if any extent - this consortium of banks has been skewing the books, at any time. (of course, that's dependent on whether the system is designed to allow universal auditability, or whether this privilege is reserved for government appointed 'objective' third party auditors, or some such nonsense)
These private blockchain systems make sense only when you abandon the concept of mining in the way we're familiar with it.

So again, it doesn't make sense to mine a private blockchain. That means *no PoW*. Signing blocks with a consortium of stake holders makes more sense here, similar to the way sidechains (Elements Alpha) are currently implemented on testnet.
So long as a specified set of these stakeholders are in consensus does the system remain secure. In fact, more secure than bitcoin; no amount of hashing power can attack it. Of course, it relies on trust, so it's inferior to Bitcoin in that way - albeit heaps more efficient so long as trust is *not* broken.
Also, talking about a 'private blockchain' is misleading to begin with; just call it a distributedly consorted database or something fancy.
@_date: 2015-11-19 21:35:33
Just read more into it. If I understand the soft fork correctly (and it's very possible I don't), it's not (only?) the normalized txids that are being committed to, but the scriptsigs. Scriptsigs in the legacy transaction format would be empty, making for a txid (hash of the full transaction) that is not malleable in the same way it is now. In essence, solving the problem.
The major downside here is the requirement of having a structure elsewhere that contains the scriptsigs you need to prove a (SW-enabled) transaction is valid. I guess that all transaction (versions) taking advantage of this, would need an OP_TRUE [things] output.
This means transactions cannot be validated without having access to this structure. Not only would it add complexity to the protocol, it also adds complexity to - as far as I can see - pretty much everything that has intimate knowledge of what a transaction is; wallets/processors/exchanges, explorers, validators, etc. etc.
The hard fork, on the other hand, changes nothing in the way transactions are validated (scriptsigs remain inside the transaction, legacy outputs remain entirely possible in the same way they are now), they only require prevtxid in an input to be something other than the hash of the full transaction (namely, the transaction without the scriptsigs) - making it a hard fork.
Seems to me the hard fork is a bullet we have to swallow once, and then be done with forever. The soft fork is a bullet we dodge at first, and then shoot ourselves in the foot with forever. So yes, it's messy either way, but longer term - I think we'd be better off with the hard fork. Thoughts?

Yeah, I got that [wrong]( Apologies.
This scriptsig structure, however, does need to live somewhere in the block (as you say). The last transaction / footer is the place that makes sense - requiring to only recalculate the merkle tree at the tail rather than both the tail and the head.
I don't think I'm all that happy (yet?) with this structure / the scriptsigs being stored anywhere other than the transaction it belongs to.

On the contrary. It is a way to move applications that desire instant payment into regions that *are* secure.
The lightning network or other micropayments network alternatives being the prime example here. But also (imo to a lesser degree) green-address-like transactions (trusted cosigners), or actively using RBF &amp; CPFP.
As a simple demonstration of why 0-conf is *never* secure. Let's say I have a (mere) 5% of the hashing power, or am colluding with a 5% aggregate of miners sympathetic to / paid for my way of using / abusing the system by double spending. I can guarantee that the 5% hashing power I have access to will double-spend any and all of my transactions into an address that I own.
Broker/merchant/casino/whatever x accepts 0-conf transactions, and charges a 2% premium for their added risk on my (someone they don't know or trust) using this service.
There's a 3% difference here, which I can abuse for profit/theft. I will simply purchase whatever it is they are selling, double spend, hope for the best, and in a *guaranteed* 5% of cases I will get my money back and get the product for free. As I am paying the 2% risk-premium, I will, on average, net a 3% profit on every single transaction I make with this 0-conf accepting party X.
This works even when *all* nodes enforce a 0-conf-sympathetic local policy (ie. first-seen, they forget nothing, and they don't relay double spends or flag them). 0-conf is *always* insecure.

The best solution we know of, which unfortunately is also the most complex (well, arguably. I think it's complex compared to the current way of thinking about transactions), is 'segregated witness', which is, as you say, a hard fork. It's available in the Alpha sidechain. Whether it will ever be integrated into Bitcoin is doubtful, because BIP 62 covers the problem.
BIP 62 is fairly straightforward. Essentially, you can think of it as enforcing transactions being constructed in one specific canonical way, rather than one of many. As a result, transactions cannot be 'malled' without changing its meaning.

Whether processors / merchants accept 0-conf is their choice, they can or should have anticipated for this, and the current state of this patch will allow them to do so without increased risk.

Here's an irony:
Whenever maxing out the block size limit favors the argument of larger blocks, such as the table in the OP, blocks are argued to max out. (best case assumption)
Whenever maxing out the block size limit disfavors the argument of larger blocks, such as implicit scalability problems problems, blocks are argued "not to max out in practice". (best case assumption)
In the real world, worst case assumption must be made in either case in order to come to any rational conclusion. The former, concerning incentives - implicit to security, has a worst case where blocks are empty and fees are low. The latter, concerning scalability - implicit to security, has a worst case where blocks (with a large cap) are full and nobody can validate.
In order for us all to make the correct decision on a way forward, we must consider both of these worst cases. We can only *hope* for the best case, not act on them.

F2Pool, Antpool, Bitfury together make &gt;50% of the network. These are pools that are each run by a single person or entity.
Admittedly, miners participating in those pools comprise a much larger group, but considering these pools all mine over Stratum - these individual miners have no power over the contents they are mining other than by threatening to leave for the competition.
Realistically, these 3 pools could collude, and try and perform a 51% attack (and fail).

His idea holds under the assumption that demand for transactions on the blockchain grows faster than the number of transactions a block may hold. I believe that's reasonable to think, and even assume.
Net amounts paid in fees per transaction (on and off the chain) may, eventually, be downwardly offset with the advent of top-layered protocols such as the lightning network, or other micropayment schemes. But to see on-the-blockchain transaction fees rise is, I think, completely realistic.

@_date: 2015-09-18 23:33:25
Whoever told you micropayments on the order of cents *on* the blockchain are feasible was wrong.
They are feasible on a layer-2 model, caching layers. The Lightning Network being the most notable; allowing point-to-point payment at near zero cost (subcents).
*On*-the-chain transactions need to be validated by everyone, included in a block by miners, and remain in the blockchain indefinitely. They are costly for that reason.
@_date: 2015-11-13 22:09:24
It needs BIP112 for lightning channels to remain open indefinitely, but it can function with BIP65 alone.
It also needs BIP62 (or SW, anti malleability proposals) which can reduce risk caused by possibility of lightning node shutdowns/disconnects/ddos/etc. by allowing redeem transactions to be broadcast by external parties.
@_date: 2015-11-08 20:32:32
That's also true.
But bear in mind new nodes will connect to anything, and XT nodes will connect to core.
It also opens up a new possibility of dos (well, not really), where an attacker tells you to connect to XT nodes and vice versa - which, if you don't know the peer, you will. After which you'll be fed an invalid block before disconnecting from it.
So as I said, it will be interesting to see how this plays out

The math in there is [all wrong]( and shouldn't be referenced anymore.
- Any coin is vulnerable to a 51% attack.

It's understandable to seek a governing body to solve this; most people have, regretfully or not, been programmed to think about solving this through hierarchical constructs. However, this line of thinking is wholly incompatible with the Bitcoin ethos.

I don't think committing to normalized txids in the block is that easy a softfork. Sure it's not that hard to wrap your head around or implement, but a hard fork, in this case, would just make things so, so much easier for everyone, *once we have it behind us*.

If you want *instant* and *guaranteed* payment using *current* technology, then your options are, as you say, Coinbase (et. al.) and greenaddress-constructs. Both involve trust.
Bitcoin is, at the very core, a *settlement* system: this network converges onto consensus over events that happened in the past given time.
If you want decentralized, instant and secure payments: Lightning Network, payments channels.

The last link, I think, sufficiently clarifies on the difference. Vitalik has done extensive research on the viability of PoS, he has - in the end - concluded/conceded to PoW being superior unless you're ok with, in case you yourself weren't around, trusting that at least 1 peer that was honest in the (entire) past must also be honest today.
The compromise in the best of PoS schemes is similar to the compromise possible with the introduction of UTXO commitments. That is, when doing an initial block download / synchronisation, *not* doing a full validation / index and instead fetching the UTXO set from peers, thereby trusting the entire past (which you haven't checked) was honest. Contrary to PoS, however, in PoW you will *always* at least *be able* to somewhat safely rely on block commitments made in the past because a proof-of-work is an objective measure of a commitment to a chain, whereas a PoS isn't.

Saying this *hits* consensus code is fair enough, saying it changes rules, or changes consensus, isn't.
This library has more than sufficiently been tested, its integrity has been vetted to higher standards than the relevant curve in OpenSSL ever has.
It is being used for signing in Bitcoin Core since 0.10, and many more applications have been using it for a long time now. Its application in production was safe a year ago, and the sole reason it has taken all that time to actually get into Core *was* to double and triple check.

You can define your outputs as multisig and act as cosigner. You would, as cosigner, actively have to enforce the encumbrance you put on the outputs, and only sign transactions for which the encumbrance remains. Users would need a custom wallet (not unlike GreenAddress) which will ask you to sign(/broadcast) any and all transactions.
Another solution would be coloured coins as suggests.

It's working pretty well to be sure. And I have no doubt the process of building the consensus critical code was done with extreme diligence and care. But it isn't identical while it needs to be.


It isn't with a fully encompassing libconsensus; it'd be running off the same engine.
@_date: 2015-11-13 12:11:40


You're misunderstanding. You *can't* implement a fee market if miners *guarantee* transaction inclusion in a block. If miners, at any point, guarantee inclusion, at any price, you can just pay the lowest price possible and move on with an unconfirmed transaction - a guarantee (a promise with certainty) is equal in value to infinite confirmations.
A guarantee means consensus. Consensus means a transaction has settled.


This implies fees become part of the consensus ruleset, whereas today they are nowhere near it - as it should be.


The right way to do this is to let the market play this out, as markets do.

Anyone can submit a pull request to the repository. A pull request is a set of code someone is proposing be merged into it. This pull request is then reviewed, discussed and tested. When the change is considered 'good', it's been tested, everything is fine, the pull request will be merged - Wladimir typically does this.
Pull requests relating to consensus critical code, or with a BIP attached to it, are typically discussed and tested more thoroughly - as I answered below, and are only merged with ACKs across the board and no unanswered question.

It's unfortunate, but the current behemothically-inefficient terrible-to-count impossible-to-verify-en-masse ballot voting system where you check a box with a pencil and drop it in a box has one benefit over pretty much all cryptographic alternatives we can image: you **can't** prove on what you voted **after** you voted, only **while** voting.*
This hugely mitigates the *non-trivial* edge case where your family is being held hostage unless you vote x.
Most things that allow you to do this:


bring that edge-case right back into the voting problem.
So before anyone says *"well, hey, who's gonna take a family hostage just to muster a single vote? And anyway, isn't this what the police is for?"* -- well no, the hostage-family is, of course, a worst-case fear-inducing analogy, the real problem is people like this:  (no offense, it can sometimes be rational)
(And for the hostage vs police scenario: it *is* a problem if what you're voting on holds reign over the police.)
This is also why people can be outraged when someone posts a hey-watch-me-vote-in-this-ballot-voting-booth-smiley-face-wink-selfie on Facebook .. with the ballot paper in hand and the relevant checkbox checked off and clearly visible.
So, shitty as pencil-voting may be, they have a significant benefit that is very hard to replicate in any cryptographic/electronic alternative.

This sounds like a locomotive on top of a house of cards to me. At the *least*, you need something deterministic. It's impossible to converge on an agreed-upon outcome if the process to getting there is not deterministic.
If there is not something deterministic, the only realistic outcome I see happening is the decision being deferred to a small group of 12 aging white males - making it deterministic, and centralized.

Consensus of the network.
In fact everything is protected by consensus of the network - and nothing else; if the consensus is that cryptographic protection (whether signatures are valid, for example) is meaningless, then it is precisely meaningless. This is why running a node is important.
@_date: 2015-11-13 16:02:29


The calculations get harder when miners churn out more computing power. Every 2 weeks, the difficulty is deterministically adjusted such that miners will, on average, mine a block every 10 minutes.


While miners do process transactions, their goal is to secure the blockchain by performing 'work' on top of the best chain, making it increasingly irreversible. All participants in this network process(/validate/relay) transactions.


Mining doesn't stop, coin production does. Mining continues and is paid for with transaction fees - which will gradually take over the long term incentives.
By the time the last satoshi is mined in the year ~2140, we wouldn't even notice production has stopped; fees will have taken over subsidy amounts by many orders of magnitude. By the time this happens it will primarily be a symbolic event of no economic significance.

Except that isn't really true. Who's gonna drop the hammer when there are no economically dependent nodes around that would benefit from decentralisation? If a soft fork is ever *needed* to limit the growth rate, all that's left running the network will be VCs and a handful of huge-scale miners, that all benefit from larger blocks, and larger centralisation.

I don't think bike sheds are necessarily minor (though I suppose the analogy would suggest they are), they're just topics that are super easy to form an opinion on. As a result, spending time on discussing it frivolously (with no goal, no format, no direction, which is something the scaling bitcoin conference is explicitly trying to combat) is exceedingly pointless.
Actually, the block size debate being a bike shed topic, especially here on Reddit and I think nearly all other media aswell, is becoming a more and more sensible statement to make, I think, while it's far from unimportant. We're getting nowhere the way it's being debated now, arguments are hashed and rehashed, nobody is convincing anyone, nobody is changing their minds even in the face of facts, nobody is listening to anyone else. And the same goes for governance - it's happened in the past, and it'll happen again. They're all bike sheds.
For example:






In contrast to:

I have some reservations on what I believe a good policy is that may be very different from yours, yet they can both be reflected in the Bitcoin Core software.
Why imply that software coming from the same place is factually configured equally, and is incompatible with disagreeing users, while the opposite is clearly true?

It's a fair proposal.
But generally, I don't like having to depend on solutions that hinge on whether attacks are costly or not. I'd rather determine a node's honesty by observing its behaving honestly, rather than proof of its x BTC 'security deposit' into running the network. A solution to Sybil by making it costly is not a solution to Sybil at all, only a speed bump (which may arguably be effective nonetheless).

This, too, is possible in the pencil-disaster, by auditing a session and seeing your vote wait in line for the count.
Realistically, pencil-voting checks off all the boxes for a proper, good, voting system, except one: it's hard and costly to audit (but possible).
Because it's hard (and dreary, and costly, and voluntary - rather than paid), the actual auditing is not done en-masse, which - in practice - *does* present a problem, which makes the pencil-voting system problematic.
I'd be more than willing to switch to an electronic/cryptographic alternative, but *only* if it checks off all the boxes, *and* improves on the problem.

You can only 'set' an exchange rate by buying or selling. Doing that is equivalent to 'accepting a 0 conf as payment'.
0 conf has never been safe for payment. The fact many processors do this doesn't mean they don't take on risk and don't take far going measures to prevent abuse.
Local node policies are wholly outside the control of these processors/merchants/exchanges, and if reliance on their enforcing some arbitrary policy that suits them is part of their business model, then that business model needs another looking at - not the way independent nodes are hoped to act.

They're there so clients can skip a large chunk of the (time consuming) verification process.
You only need the block headers of a chain to determine the amount of work in it. You don't need to verify the entire chain (as in, all transaction it contains) to get the work. You only need to check if the headers make a valid block hash, and if the headers are otherwise valid (well structured, etc.), compute the difficulty (from the bits header) and then derive the amount of work performed.

Aah -- I read it as "why would I buy if the price is going to increase [after I buy]?"
The simple logic of a post-halving-price-increase is based on the following assumptions:
- (dollar) demand remains the same
- (bitcoin) supply halves/decreases
Therefore price must rise.
The first assumption presumes people are buying [a dollar amount of] bitcoin regardless of price, and regardless of any speculative cause.
The second assumption presumes the only supply in the market comes from the block subsidy / miners selling their earnings.
Neither of those assumptions will hold completely for many reasons, but the effect of a price increase (or pressure to increase at the least) will remain if either assumption holds for even a bit.

Why not:
    The miner expressed a desire to include transaction xyzabc123987. This transaction creates 500 Bitcoin out of thin air and is invalid by current personal ruleset. Unless a recall is issued, miners will include this transaction in 4000 blocks (block 382149, estimated to be generated on November 6, 2015). To switch your current ruleset to allow for this transaction to be included, click here. To leave your personal transaction validation policy unchanged and not see this message again, click here.
If the method outlined is a good way to come to consensus on a problem, why limit that process to changing the block size limit only? Why not use it to determine which transactions, valid or otherwise, to include in the chain? Indeed, why mine at all?

I'm not sure I agree with that.
Even using payments channels you'll have to settle on the blockchain eventually - paying a fee. The network must be subsidized through these fees (assuming block rewards are nil, for a second), so those fees would have to be sizeable enough for there to be enough incentive to properly secure the network. Whether this incentive is paid for by fees of individual coke transactions, or fees of payments channel settlements doesn't matter, the aggregate amount must be the same for network security to be the same. So whichever method of payment becomes most prevalent (individual transactions, or payments channels), it has no impact on the cost of each transaction - the amount must be enough to pay for decent security eventually.
Ie. you can have 100 transactions lumped into a single settlement transactions using a payments channels, but if everyone does this then fees of these settlement transactions must inevitably rise for network security to remain the same. Or, equivalently, individual coke-transaction fees directly on the blockchain must decrease (assuming incentive for security doesn't increase).

Short answer: Yes.
Long answer: No.
Consensus takes time. The network comes to consensus on the current state of the ledger/blockchain through performed and proven 'work'. For the state of the blockchain to be reverted to a certain point, the work that has been done since that point must be performed again. Therefore, the more work that's performed, the harder, and more unlikely, it becomes for the blockchain to be reverted to a previous state.
Performing work takes time. So, logically, it takes time to get to a point where transactions confirmed in the blockchain become, for all intents and purposes, irreversible.
It's important to note here that, **in theory**, *all transactions* can *always* be reverted *given enough work* to prove the existence of a new 'best chain'. (The idea is that this can't happen because it's practically impossible for any one person or organisation to perform that much work while the rest of the network is actively competing to perform the most work). It follows, though, that merchants can *never* be 100% confident a transaction is permanent, not if there's 1 confirmation, 5, 10 or 500. It'll approach 100%, but never get there. Doesn't matter what the confirmation time is, it could be 2 seconds or 2 hours: you can never be 100% confident.
At some point, though, merchants can realistically be confident enough to decide a transaction will not be reversed. They can factor the risk they take making this decision in the price of their product or service (the exact same thing happens to account for credit card fraud).
The decision to accept a payment can even be made while the transaction is unconfirmed. This, in addition to confidence in proof-of-work, requires you to be confident in the honesty of the payer and the network. Miners must not mine a double-spent transaction, and double-spends must be flagged while propagating, for example. The risk you're taking is, of course, higher than accepting a confirmed transaction, but not high enough to require a customer to wait before taking his coke off the counter.
To further increase confidence in an unconfirmed transaction, the merchant may use a payment processor, which could account for the added risk, or pro-actively monitor the network for double spends or otherwise fishy metrics. There's also instant-confirmation concepts (*not* the DarkCoin thing, which isn't a solution) that require you to trust a co-signer such as GreenAddress or centralized / custodial payment processors such as Coinbase which can somewhat guarantee a transaction will not be double-spent.
In practice, you'll find that for most reversible or over-the-counter *purchases*, the waiting time before a merchant will accept your transaction after having seen it, is 0. You'll be able to take your coke off the counter immediately after payment, even if the transaction is unconfirmed, or a book you've ordered on Amazon may be immediately processed (since the processing of the order may be cancelled by Amazon if the payment ends up being reversed or double-spent before confirmation).
TL;DR - Consensus takes time, but that doesn't mean you'll have to wait that time.

A full node is usually referred to as a fully validating machine that does not mine. A miner is also fully validating - it is also a full node, but they're usually referred to as a miner. (These definitions were different a couple years ago)
The odds of 'winning the lottery' with a typical 2.7 ghz USB burster is about 1 in 6.08*10^9, or 1 in 6 billion per 10 minutes. You'll generate a valid block every 114 thousand years. Running at 2.5 watts, it'll cost you only 5 or so pounds a year, so it'll cost only half a million pounds worth of electricity (~current prices) to find a block worth a staggering ~7000 pounds at current block subsidy and exchange rate somewhere in the next 114 thousand years.

First off, you should only mine when you know what you're doing, can invest in equipment/location sizeably (2500 likely won't cut it) and are willing to take a huge risk in that your investment may be worthless in a few months, or even on arrival. There's a real cost (of both time and money) to mining which, if run inefficiently, won't net you any gains.
That said, investing in bitcoin by buying bitcoins seems to be getting less risky with every passing day. Where a few years ago the possibility of seeing your investment's value reduced to 0 overnight was realistic, today - as the ecosystem, and confidence in the technology continues to grow - this seems far-fetched, albeit of course possible.
As a risk mitigation strategy, it's wise to dollar-cost-average your way into owning bitcoin; buying a small amount at a given period, regardless of the price. You'll account for any sudden down-swings (and up-swings) in price that way and you won't be as stressed out as you would buying the lump sum in one go.

RBF + Scorched Earth is designed to disincentivize fraudsters from double spending an unconfirmed transaction. It's designed primarily to protect merchants. An RBF double spend + Scorched Earth will cost a merchant the full amount paid, but the fraudster will also pay the full amount; so why would he attempt a double spend in the first place?
If it is beneficial for merchants to opt-out of this, then there is no reason to have it implemented in the first place.
Let alone the soft/hard fork issues, the community fragmentation, the wallet implementation changes, payment processor changes, semantic changes, the ugliness of solving something by permanently adding a flag in the blockchain, etc. such a feature would bring along with it.
RBF also allows transactions with an insufficient fee to be scurried along into a block by double-spending it with a higher fee (/lower return amount). It's an OK solution to such a problem, but child-pays-for-parent is a much better solution which has little to no down-side because it doesn't perform a double-spend of any kind, as opposed to RBF, which double-spends by design.
In child-pays-for-parent, this happens:
- Customer pays for a thing, but doesn't include a fee in his payment.
- Merchant sees the payment, and assesses the lack of a fee will not be mined any time soon.
- Merchant decides to spend the payment in a transaction to himself, but *with* a fee attached which is sufficient to account for the self-spend transaction and the payment transaction.
- Alternatively: Merchant could refuse the payment until confirmed (if merchant is anal about transaction fees), or accept the payment unconfirmed - and unlikely to ever be confirmed (if merchant is crazy)
- Both parent (customer -&gt; merchant) and child (merchant -&gt; merchant) transactions are now considered to have a sufficient fee, and miners will include them both in a block.

Apple Pay uses NFC, a short-range communications technology operating on the 13.56 Mhz frequency band, with a closed/unspecific/largely undisclosed communications protocol on top of it (I'm not even sure they use NDEF). The technology is compatible as far as communications devices go with wireless payments cards by Visa/MasterCard/Maestro [(ISO 14443)]( that have been around for years. Most modern phones support communication using NFC, and with it, ISO 14443 smartcards, and in theory, Apple Pay.
All of these technologies have been collaboratively and openly developed in the last 14 years or more by many large and small stakeholders [(Nokia, NXP, Google, Samsung, Sony, Intel, Visa, MC)]( through the NFC Forum. Except Apple, because Apple is the cunt that ruins every party. In all of these years, Apple refused to take part in or even look at the technology in a productive capacity.
And now, Apple steals the whole thing, changes some things that make it incompatible with everyone else, and claim they invented it. It's impressive, really.
Bitcoin predominantly uses QR codes because they're universal, simple and can be used by anyone, anywhere. They can be printed on a receipt, sent as an image, shown on a web page, whatever. Unlike NFC or Bluetooth to communicate an address/transaction, it just works anywhere, always. It is frictionless, you don't need additional hardware, there's no barrier to entry.
That said, payment over NFC or bluetooth is better. It provides a better user experience, better privacy, better security. But it requires merchants to purchase a terminal, and it requires customers to have a phone/device which supports it. For the time being, QR-codes are predominant for this reason; zero barrier to entry.

Can be forgotten though, simply by spending the outputs. Spending multiple outputs into a single new output shrinks the utxo size.
@_date: 2015-03-23 15:41:12


Transactions consist of inputs and outputs.
Inputs spend previously existing outputs.
Outputs define how it can be spent (such as: this output can only be spent by the owner of address x), and have an amount attached to them.
By summing the amounts of each, the difference is the fee.
Like this:
Alice has 3 unspent outputs 'in her name':
- txoA - 5 BTC
- txoB - 4 BTC
- txoC - 3 BTC
She wants to send 9 BTC to Bob, pay 1 BTC in fees, and keep the remainder for herself. She'll construct a transaction like this one.
- txoA
- txoB
- txoC
Total amount: 12 BTC
- Bob -&gt; 9 BTC
- Alice -&gt; 2 BTC
Total amount: 11 BTC
The difference is 1 BTC, which may be claimed by the miner.
TL;DR - The fee is *not* explicitly defined, the miners derive it from the difference in input and output amounts.


The bitcoin address space is 2^160, the address space of ipv4 is 'only' 2^32. There's plenty of room. In fact, there isn't enough bitcoin (by a long shot) to spread out over the full address space.


In theory, they will. In practice, no way in hell. The private key space is (a little less than) 2^256, this number is unimaginably large. Related, see this:

Most videos have a habit of complicating an actually very simple process.
Mining in a single sentence:
Miners hash continually changing block headers using SHA256 until the resulting hash is lower than some threshold value, which will make it a valid block.
SHA256 is a hashing algorithm. You can think of hashing as encrypting something with no decryption key in existence: it's a one-way street. The resulting hash from SHA256 *over* arbitrary data (which results in 256 bits of data) is unpredictable, meaning the chances of the first bit being 0, is 50%, the first 2 bits being 0 is 25%, 3 - 12.5%, 4 - 6.25%, etc.
It follows, that if you want a hash with 4 leading zeroes, you'd have to do roughly 16 hashes over random data before you have a decent chance of *randomly* finding a hash which has 4 leading zeroes. Essentially, this is what mining is. We're looking for hashes with a shitload of leading zeroes (put simply). Currently we're looking for about 65 or so leading zeroes before the network agrees the block is valid. This means you need to do 1/0.5^65 hashes before you have a decent chance of finding one. So about ~3.6*10^19 hashes.
The data you're hashing are the block headers, these are 80 bytes of data containing some values: block version number (4 bytes), previous block hash (32 bytes), merkle root (32 bytes, combined hash of all transactions), a timestamp (4 bytes), difficulty/bits (4 bytes, which you can calculate the threshold value from) and a nonce (4 byte number which increments after every hash). Changing a single bit in the block headers (from either the nonce, merkle root and/or timestamp headers) will change the resulting hash completely. Typically what miners will do is increment the nonce, hash, check if it's valid, and repeat (until it's valid).
The other thing that miners do is verify transactions and process them into the block. This is reflected in the merkle root in the headers. (Note: Transactions do not have to be between 2 parties, they can be anything.)
Here's a mining simulator which could help you visualize the whole thing:
@_date: 2015-10-10 14:17:59
You said this earlier:


But actually, end users have total power over the block size limit. It's 1 MB, because they enforce it. Anyone in the world can do the work and create a block that is larger, but it matters not, because end users will reject its existence, and it will thusly be so.
Many people may not be happy with the entirety of the system enforcing this particular rule over any other - simple observation would indicate this, but it is a *rule* we are all in agreement with regardless, something we all enforce, and something we all have power over.


Another interpretation would be: opt-in to this change, or opt-out of Bitcoin. This is a sentiment that the current Bitcoin system is currently totally devoid of. "Comply to these wishes, or else.." - this expectation does not exist, *precisely* because *everyone* has total power over the consensus ruleset.


No, this is a method of doing *automated hard forks*. They are inherently more centralized.


I would agree it is easier. Whether that's a good thing: hardly.

So let's summize the otherwise lengthy description of game theory into 'a rational actor will act such that his payoff is maximized'.
Bitcoin 'solves' the byzantine generals problem, a theoretically unsolvable computer science problem, by applying some neat tricks that can be explained with game theory.
Concretely, Bitcoin has added rewards for behavior that can be considered honest; if you mine a new best block that follows a specific ruleset, you are given Bitcoins. It is rational for you to do this so long as the cost to creating this block is lower than the reward it yields. 
Furthermore, it is rational for everyone else to accept *your* valid block, and work on top of that, rather than keep working on the 'old' best chaintip, because everyone else honors the rule that only the best/longest chain is valid. Working on the not-best/not-the-longest chain would make for a mining reward that is worthless; it is therefore rational for you to keep up with the best chain, and accept any block that makes the best chain 'better' - and start working on top of it.
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:22:00
Compromised how?
If it turns out shortcuts in the SHA256 algorithm are possible (getting to the same result by doing less calculations) then it's really not a huge problem for mining so long as the shortcut is public information.
In fact, (some rather limited mining-specific) shortcuts in SHA256 are possible right now and miners are actively using/abusing. It allows them to skip the last round in the calculation, gaining them a small performance boost. Net result: zero; so long as everyone's doing it the difficulty will adjust accordingly and nothing will change.
If the shortcut is more significant, allowing you to skip, say, 99% of the calculation and getting to the same result (which is ridiculous and I'd venture to say impossible) then, equivalently, the difficulty will shoot up, while the cost/work performed to satisfy that difficulty will remain the same: nothing happens.
We could literally mine with MD5, which is so broken it's barely more than cheese, and the system would work perfectly fine.
If it's somehow possible to reverse a SHA256 hash to *an* origin value that happens to be a valid public key, (which seems far-fetched because there's an infinite number of origin values, it's generally, like significant shortcuts, considered impossible), it's probably wise to switch out SHA256 for some other digesting algorithm for address generation primarily, and for mining at lower priority. Reversing an address to its private key is, on top of SHA256, secured by RIPE-MD and ECDSA. So a compromised SHA256 doesn't mean a compromised address.
In any case. SHA256 just turned 14 (years of age) and no real vulnerabilities have been discovered yet, which hasn't been for lack of trying. It looks to be a rock solid digesting algorithm.
The signature algorithm, ECDSA (secp256k1), is much more prone to compromise.

Client update, done.


Depends fully on the precedent that led to it.


Most likely, yes.
There's some twisted ways to do it as a soft fork by sort-of spoofing the timestamps, reducing difficulty to 1, then embedding another PoW algo in a sham DSHA256 PoW difficulty-1 (which is trivially produced nowadays) header. But that'd be the ugliest hack one could possibly imagine to soft forking this sort of change.


Bitcoin is whatever the economy that represents it think it is.


There wouldn't be a 'hash rate drop' to speak of because the algorithms' respective hashrate doesn't equate to one another.
Presumably, the incentive structure that makes Bitcoin work is the exact same, so if that incentive structure is worth a damn then the reward to acting honestly would (for economically rational participants) outweigh the reward of attack.
However, considering the entire mining market would essentially reset, it's probable this would shake things up considerably.
All that said, a looming PoW change is a sort-of sword of Damocles and/or mutually assured destruction type of change. The option is there, and it should always be there, but it will probably never be entertained.

BIP 9 is a mechanism where miners signal eachother and the network for soft fork (backward compatible) feature support - and it is representative for all participants that are required in the immediate future to enforce some feature: miners.
For the soft fork to be successful, there still needs to be widespread community support and enforcement of the feature, but for deployment only miners are necessary.
A hard fork, on the other hand, cannot be deployed by miners alone, because a hard fork requires everyone in the network to know about and agree to the change.
BIP 9 signaling is not representative of everyone in the network, therefore it cannot be used [as the sole mechanism] for hard fork updates.

Let's take bitcoin mining for an example.
Mining works by taking 80-byte block headers and computing a SHA-256 digest over this data. The outcome is an *unpredictable*, yet *deterministic* and certainly *not* random 256-bit hash.
I can take a gamble, and tell you the first 3 bits of this hash will be zeroes. The chances of me being right will be 0.5^3 or roughly once out of every 8 attempts. None of this is random, yet I can gamble on the outcome.
Gambling hinges on being unpredictable, and, ***by inclusion***, randomness. 
To be completely strict: Randomness is unpredictable. But unpredictability isn't *necessarily* random.
Functionally, there's a great difference between the two terms.

Small asterisk/note, the lightning network/protocol allows for further division, but it turns into a trusted model at that point (because while a lightning channel might agree further division is possible - the bitcoin network will not. Therefore so long as the lightning channel operates as intended - honest - can transactions be negotiated with smaller units).
Perhaps when this (divisibility) becomes an issue we can use some nifty economic tricks to mitigate/eliminate the trust required for smaller units in the lightning network to work (such as security deposits which may be unlocked by a fraud proof or something).

Trivia, it takes *only* about 10 years to generate that many addresses if the *entire* current network computing power were used to generate addresses instead of doing mining. (assuming ASICs can generate a privpubkey pair, *which they can't*)
2 years ago, it would take the network ~130 000 (thousand) years to do this at the hashrate at that time.
Let's assume for a second that in another 2 years, generating them will be trivial (it won't), and storing those addresses + searching the dump will be too (definately won't). Then there'll be this: there's only enough bitcoin to fit into 2.1 * 10^14 addresses (where an address contains 1 satoshi and no more)! Far far less than the absolutely humongous amount of addresses you've just generated (~10^24), which is even still far far far faaar less than the total amount of addresses possible. (~10^48)
So here's the funny part: you've just found probably *one*, and likely *not many* addresses that collide. The probabilty of that/those addresses containing *any* bitcoin, is essentially 0. You'll have wasted computing power and storage space the world has never even heard of for a collided address which contains no bitcoin. Hurray!

Proof of stake means that there is no penalty (such as when burning electricity to produce 'work') when you are making the choice to build on one fork or another. Which means that you might aswell build on both.
Making this decision and committing to it is the whole entire reason we have miners; the decision resolves disputes, which is what we use the blockchain for. In Proof-of-Stake algorithms where the nothing-at-stake problem exists there is no meaningful commitment to a decision, so it is an incomplete and broken consensus algorithm.
Your proposed solution is basically what PoS is.
That solution would only never create a fork in a system where there exists identity that can guarantee there are no two participants that can be allowed to create a block at the same height, which is undesirable for systems like these where voluntary participation and censorship resistance are among its cornerstones.
@_date: 2016-05-30 23:11:26
All blocks propagated over the relay network (mostly) refer to transactions that have already been validated. I doubt libsecp256k1 has any measurable effect there. Faster block creation code (_I think_) is referring to GBT optimisations, which most pools do not use.
Frankly I think our best bet with regards to minimising latency (for miners) in the near-term is weak blocks. Which allows peered miners to prevalidate an entire block, and have a valid PoW of these blocks be propagated to them in a single TCP packet regardless of the size of block contents.
Then later down the line there's some shimmer of hope for braiding, which might take care of orphans and latency bound bottlenecks altogether.
None of these other solutions-that-aren't-solutions are very interesting in comparison.

I was surprised to learn Confidential Transactions could be soft forked (although it would add way more complexity than a hard fork would) - it doesn't seem to me SW can be soft forked in a similar way, though. The only way I can think of is by committing to the 'SW transaction' in another, already included, transaction/output - one that contains the 'normalized TXID', if you will, and enforcing that commitment through a soft fork. That doesn't sound too useful a soft-fork if I'm not mistaken. What am I missing?

Signaling is not a vote on whether or not to deploy a change, it's a method of signaling among miners to indicate they support the change (support as in understand) and will start enforcing a soft fork rule that the users are presumably already set on rolling out.
The threshold is such as it is not to require that that percentage of miners be required to roll it out, but to be sufficiently confident that any miner that is not ready to support it is unlikely to generate any blocks that are not swiftly reorganised out of the chain.
In a sentence: signalling is meant to ensure smooth soft fork activation, not whether it is activated at all.

Nodes you are connecting to behave just like your node: they won't trust you worth a damn.
The information you're giving them, is not used for anything singularly important whatsoever for the simple reason you can lie about it (as you apparently do).
The user agent is used for human readable (and untrustworthy) heuristics. The ip address is gossip. The clock you're reporting is used for Network Adjusted Time, and, in your 2012 case, will be immediately discarded because it diverges too much from another node's presumably more accurate 2016 clock.
Every node in the Bitcoin network is selfish first and foremost. They don't care about doing sanity checks (and they aren't there for sanity) on the values you're reporting about yourself, they care about the transactions and blocks you're relaying to them - and they will validate those, for themselves, to certainty.
They certainly don't care about you losing a block in the Grand Propagation Race, because not reporting failure will presumably only increase their own odds.
Further. Say nodes do try to correct eachother's self reported values. You tell me the year is 2012? Sure. I'll tell you it's actually 2021. Imagine the attack vectors that would open up if you were to rely on me giving you correct information like that. There are no such reliances in the Bitcoin network, for the simple reason that no single entity can be trusted with telling the truth.

I mean, I get the sentiment here. But I think it's misleading.
What's consensus is OpenSSL aswell as libsecp256k1 behaving 'correctly', without any bugs. That 'correct' behaviour is not well defined, true enough, but I think it's fair to say its implemented behaviour *including the unfound bugs* is not the *intention*.
We can resolve the topic of what exactly the consensus rules are (rather, we can get to the bottom of why we disagree on this), by asking this question:


This was the infamous CVE that created 184 odd billion bitcoins out of thin air. It was caused by a 'bug' in consensus code which allowed output amount values to overflow, and lead to the creation of a fantastic amount of money. Was the update that resolved this a hard fork? Or was it merely a bug fix?
If it was the former, then consensus rules are exactly what the code describes.
If it was the latter, then consensus rules are exactly what the entirety of the system think is the intention of the code that implements it.
Considering the swiftness, and the lack of any controversy, with which this particular CVE was resolved, I argue for the latter.
Does libsecp256k1 change the intention of the consensus rule enforced currently by OpenSSL? No. And (well, I suppose depending on who you talk to) it therefore does not change consensus rules.
Back to the reality of today. Saying libsecp256k1 has, in the past year alone, been more than sufficiently vetted to safely replace OpenSSL and all the implications this entails, is not a leap of the imagination.

You can't be certain for a number of reasons:
- A fraudster could be colluding with a miner(s), never having to broadcast a double-spent transaction; you would never know a transaction is being double spent until you see it in a block.
- A fraudster could trick you into believing a transaction isn't being double-spent by making sure your node / source of transactions is only connected to the fraudster's nodes; the fraudster could effectively filter any and all transactions coming your way, including blocks. Exceptionally hard to do, but not unheard of (for example, the tor network could *relatively* easily be sheltered from the 'real' bitcoin network, and be presented with a parallel chain instead. But still very hard and costly to do.)
- Astronomic bad luck; the double spent transaction could somehow propagate to more nodes/miners than a 30-second-head-start transaction would.
- Replace-by-fee combined with more bad luck.
You *can* be reasonably *confident* an unconfirmed transaction will not be double spent (or rather: a double spent transaction will not be mined) if the original transaction had a reasonable head-start. But certain? Nope. You can only start being more and more certain after the first confirmation (and you'll still never be 100% certain).
There's a few ways to be even more confident (or, less confident) faster, for example if nodes would relay *and* flag double-spent transactions. Currently, most/many nodes will ignore double-spent transactions, meaning that if an attempt at a double-spend is being made, you may never know. Knowledge of such an attempt is very important if you want to assess confidence in a transaction, which is why payment processors and such should (currently) deploy as many nodes and be as broadly connected as possible. Hopefully in the (near) future, nodes will flag and propagate double-spend attempts.
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:44:03
You don't, ever, expose your private key to anyone. Not a node, not a miner, not your dog or your neighbour.
When you broadcast a transaction to the network you would typically 'sign' it *using* your private key. This signature proves you are the owner of the private key, without ever showing the actual key, to anyone.
Specifically, this technology is ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). It's been around for many years and can be compared to RSA, which has been around for even longer (since the 70s). The school of cryptography this is part of, is asymmetric cryptography.
Put simply, you have 2 keys. One is private (known only to you), the other is public (potentially known to anyone). You can compute the public key if you have the private key, but you cannot 'get back' to the private key, if all you have is the public key.
Additionally, you can *encrypt* data using either key, and *decrypt* it with the other.
So, let's say I want to prove to you I am the owner of a private key, without ever showing the private key to you, I would do this:
I will provide to you the public key which I have computed from my private key. I will then give you some plain ptext/data, which I will 'sign'(/encrypt) using my private key. I will also give you the signed(/encrypted) form of this text.
*If* you can then successfully decrypt the encrypted data I've sent you (using the public key), and it is equal to the plain text I told you I would sign, then I *must* be the owner of the private key.
The same, basically, happens while creating a transaction. Every transaction is accompanied by signatures that prove the money that transaction is spending comes from a source which is legitimate. If not, the transaction is invalid and will be rejected by the network.
It's a little more complicated than that (for example, typically you won't even expose the *public* key until you spend your bitcoin while still proving you are the owner of the private key), but this is the gist of it.
@_date: 2015-03-31 10:34:53
Everything you say is correct.


There is a distinction to make between RBF and RBF+Scorched Earth, the former is a solution to fee-less transactions being stuck, the other is a solution to the problem RBF introduces which allows fraud by double spending unconfirmed transactions. Scorched earth therefore exists to prevent merchants from being defrauded, which wouldn't be *as* easy without RBF.




Also true. But I would argue if the sender desires speed he should have included a fee in the first place. I don't see a reason to implement a feature to account for incompetence. Certainly not if that feature is ripe for abuse which would require yet another solution like Scorched Earth which is controversial and exceptionally anti-social.

The cost to consuming block space is quantitatively approximated by 'work', rather than the merit of some identity. Work may be performed by anyone, without permission. 'Merited identity', not so much.
Having a mix of those in a single consensus system implies the cost to consuming block space must be (in this case vastly) different based on the type of entity consuming it. The entity consuming it, miners, and these identities, select transactions that the consumed block space buys. If the claim where these entities have factually different game theoretical perspectives in rational selection policies - which is an assumption we are currently *not* making, at least for the majority of the mining network - holds true, which *would* be so under a different-type-of-miner-model, then fungibility is affected.
Fungibility, in any case, may best be preserved by enhancing privacy. Great privacy, in turn, allows for anonymity. Things like coinjoin, proper address use / stealth addresses, CT, smarter multisig schemes. Anything that makes transactions look homogeneous in meaning network-wide, apart from the fee they pay. That's paving the road toward anonymity.

That isn't the reason we still have 1MB as the current limit. The limit exists the way it was initially introduced because there is very strong contention over an agreed-upon and good way of changing it. If the Core developers would scrap the limit in the Core client tomorrow, that wouldn't change a thing. Myself and everyone else with half a brain would oppose it vehemently for the clear technical objections that surround that change.


It doesn't if that alternate implementation actually solves the problem, which - as it appears - is not the case in BitcoinXT.


You don't need credibility to fork Bitcoin software, many altcoins have shown this to be true. As for knowledge... If I want to land a rocket ship on Mars, I will either study hard on the problem, or ask knowledgeable scientists to figure out a way to do this. What I would not do is pop a Mentos in a coke bottle and hope for the best.


The whole argument of ignoring developers and scientist providing sound and objective technical arguments and discussion in favor of my own hunch of what would be best for the system, and promoting this view with no arguments to back it up just seems ridiculous to me.
I mean, I'm all for being independent of any other group or person telling me what's best. But my reaction to any such advice would first be to study and learn all I can to understand 'why' that would presumably be 'best', and *then* decide whether to actually follow that direction or not. Not laugh any objection to my gut feeling in the face and move on with that gut feeling in spite of anything. I have plenty of experience doing the latter:
"I think it's best you not have another beer, good sir."
"Quiet, you, I'll have six more! Barkeep, quench my thirst!"
While doing that is often plenty educational the following morning, whether it's a sound line of action for a global financial network I would dare question.


Agreed there. Ideally I'd like to see happen a single hard fork implementing a solution we can and shall all live with going forward. Failing that, a *single* can-kick ala BIP102 or A. Back's 2-4-8 thing is becoming more and more acceptable to me because we lack sufficient data on which 'actual' solution can be proven to be most suitable, and we are starting to be pressed for time.


As for centralisation into governance and development efforts; I don't think anyone believes this is a good thing, nor do I think that is what we are moving toward - looking at sentiment in the development community that is making an effort to allowing alternate implementations to safely and more easily exist through libconsensus contradicts it. Processes for discussion and implementation of proposals on top of the Bitcoin system, though, such as the BIP process, can (even centrally) be governed with little possibility of danger; there currently exists a single maintainer for the BIP process, for example, and it works excellently because it is all transparent and open.
I see no problem there. In fact, the network would probably benefit from a better governed social system here, so long as it remain open and inclusionary - this, too, is known to exist and work well in many other open-source projects such as Linux, Debian, TOR, Apache etc:

Yeah, those are probably gonna be in there forever.
As for scaling the utxo set: I can see a future with lite nodes, storing only txid's starting with some random number of bits. For example, if I store all txid's starting with 101, I'd only have to store roughly 12.5% of all outputs. Discovery/retrieving the full set would be much like IP routing. Downside being I'd have to trust the rest of the network to store the remainder and prevent double spends on their end like I would on my pruned set. The same could happen with storing historic full blocks.
This won't be fully trustless - although it still can be if you can expend the resources - but it will scale nicely.

Kinda sorta disagree with there being an upper limit on the UTXO set. As an worst case currently, if every single satoshi resides in a UTXO, it makes for about 2.1*10^14 * (32+8+23+4+4) bytes, assuming all-p2sh outputs (probably missing something, but the order of magnitude will be correct) - or just under 15 million gigabytes. That's obviously ridiculous. Worse, if such an abomination is ever warranted, it would make sense to hard fork into more divisible units, allowing it to grow further with no end.
As an important nuance, it will take a very very long while to wreck the UTXO set like this, as they all have to be generated out of a transaction - the maximum number of which is bound by the block size limit. Even under BIP101 it'll take decades of non-stop easily identifiable spam. So one shouldn't worry all that much (but not ignore it).

Understanding the integer factorization problem helps with that. The integer factorization problem, put simply, is that it's easy to factor 2 (prime) numbers to some other number, but it is hard to revert that number to its 2 origins (/prime factors, if origins were prime).
For example, 3 times 5 makes 15. Easy, simple. But to revert this, and get the prime factors of 15 is hard (mathematically). There's no straightforward way to do this, you'll have to try every option until you get the right answer. Substitute 3 and 5 with big ass 2048-bit primes and you'll make it computationally impossible to do, the problem becomes exponentially harder to solve when the problem grows linearly.
Note though, bitcoin doesn't use privpubkeys based on this problem, and with it, it doesn't use prime numbers (RSA). We're using ECDSA, which has its basis in a problem where a point on an elliptic curve cannot be reverted to an origin point, but this point *can* be calculated from an origin point (relatively) easily.

I always have a tough time understanding what libertarians actually want, and how they expect to achieve it.
For example, I remit roughly 70% of my income to government, all things added up. That money alone buys 60 students their (publicly subsidized) university tuition. Or it sustains 3 single mothers and their children. It lights city streets (per pop of ~10.000) and fuels public transport. It funds three open heart surgeries per month. 5 people that are inadvertently out of a job can buy groceries and pay the rent.
These are things I have absolutely no problem paying for. We are all better for it, and I can expect the same to be done for me when I'm in trouble through no fault of my own.
It makes sense to me to subsidise these things through tax. I'm all for finding more efficient ways of doing this, and I have no trouble criticizing government for incompetently and inefficiently handling my remittance - it is *my* contribution, after all. But to think of tax as theft, or something that has been taken from me? No.

It's impractical because it requires re-implementation of consensus code; this is hard if not impossible because it needs to share the exact same features and bugs in full, it's supremely complicated to prove this is true.
When libconsensus is extracted into its own library, and encompasses all consensus code, (and is tested and/or proven to be compatible) will it be practical to roll out independent implementations. Until such time; you're at risk of (accidentally or otherwise) forking off the main network.

A transaction which defines a multisig transaction is present in the blockchain as a pay-to-script-hash transaction. These type of transactions expose _only_ a 160bit hash of a serialized redeem script. The redeem script contains information about how many and which public keys are required to spend an output. The latter will only be exposed in the blockchain when that output is spent. So long as the output is unspent you know nothing, it could be 3 signatures, 5, 15, or it could be something other than multisig entirely.
Without knowing the redeemscript (excluding signatures) you can't tell what it is.
You can prove a multisig output is 2-of-3, for example, simply by providing a script which, when hashed, resolves to the same 160bit hash in the output. It then proves (and exposes to the one you're providing it to) it is what is claimed.
When you create a multisig/p2sh transaction (actually, output), you, of course, know the redeem script, so you also know it's legit.

The problem here is that this transaction did not pay a high enough fee. Not a failure of the network. If anything, it only goes to show there need to be better ways of pushing such a 'stuck' transaction through using methods like RBF and CPFP. Increasing the block size is relevant for increasing transactional capacity in the bitcoin network, *not* to fix pushing forward transactions paying insufficient fees to warrant their existence.

Yes, but there is no direct or clear incentive to do so because the consensus ruleset has no bearing on fees.
To be clear, this rule:


would directly incentivize miners to dump spam and/or padding in blocks so as to run into and increase this 'mintxinclusionfee'.
Most consensus rules that relate to fees that I can think of have caveats like this which allow it to trivially be gamed, so, to iterate: transaction fees need to stay out of consensus rules.
@_date: 2016-05-24 18:38:19
If everyone is on board we could, presumably, just use a flag day and start enforcing different rules on some coordinated block height.
But that's, frankly, unlikely, and for various reasons there'll probably always be straggling nodes and perhaps even miners. The adversarial assumptions must also take take that into account.
So we have to ensure we kill off the existing chain to prevent straggling miners aswell as adversaries from being able to remain functional, in order to 'protect' straggling individuals, while at the same time forcing them to switch to the new consensus ruleset. That's what a firm soft fork does.
In other words, the correct way to do a hard fork, is to soft fork it in.
Ironically, we can use BIP 9 to signal for it. And we can employ code for a PoW hard fork (with equivalent signalling) to offer disagreeing users a 'way out'. This ensures that the firm soft fork can only be triggered when miners are confident the ecosystem is ready for it. It becomes the miners' collective responsibility to poll this, and to do activation, while it's the community's responsibility to reach agreement on a correct way forward.
This is, I believe, the rational mechanism to change consensus rules.

The node has a full view of the network, transactions paying a fee below the minrelayfee property are not *relayed*, and evicted from the mempool on the assumption it will not be mined for a long while. The node sees everything in either case.
It is a good enough measure to counter mempool flooding. If a large number of nodes adopt a high enough minrelaytxfee to discard a large number of transactions, that is a good indicator the transactions traveling the network are not paying a fee high enough to justify its prolonged existence in the mempool as a result of the assumption that these transactions are unlikely to be mined.
While it's certainly true bigger blocks will alleviate the problem where transactions may exist in the mempool for longer than desired, I don't see the solution of having nodes raise the minrelaytxfee in any way in conflict with a higher block size limit; these solutions may go hand-in-hand seamlessly.
Bigger blocks are desired for wholly different reasons anyway, namely an increase in transactional capacity - not for having an empty mempool.

Bitcoin being a consensus system that needs a very specific ruleset that is currently only defined by a set of code in Bitcoin Core, a full reimplementation is nearly impossible to pull off, not without inadvertently changing *some* behaviour.
That said, let some enthusiastic and talented developers 'refactor' as they see fit for a few weeks, and essentially what you'll end up with is a full reimplementation approach at twice the lines of code. I guarantee it. ;)

About the same in my neck of the woods. Even more, in fact; went from 128kbit to 200mbit in about 15 years (down, ~same ratio for up). But neither yours nor my neck of the woods are representative of the aggregate total, which shows a 'meager' 25% for China (as the most optimistic!, ~17-18% EU/US) 
Nielsen's law doesn't hold by a long shot.
I don't think it's wise to follow growth trends enjoyed only by a top 'single-number' percentage point of people.
In addition, don't forget Bitcoin employs a broadcast network. These monoliths scale like O(n^2), which at some point can easily saturate the internet which, quite obviously, wouldn't be very practical. Whether 8GB blocks can pull this off in the internet 20 years from now? I have no idea, but it'll immediately happen with the internet of today.
*(As a sidenote, big-ass megacaches like the ones university or business networks sometimes use can mitigate this and bring it closer to O(n) - such is the efficiency centralisation can bring. This would therefore set an even grimmer precedent, as these megacaches could censor transactions to their heart's content with great succes.)*


O(1) block propagation is just that, *block propagation* - it doesn't mitigate O(n) transactions. It *does* cut peer-to-peer bandwidth requirements as we experience them today roughly in half - as transactions aren't being run across the network twice, but that doesn't change the O(n) bit. It'll be a very welcome update we can have in maybe a few years or sooner (IBLT, or weak blocks, or something similar) - but, frankly, nothing groundbreaking in the scalability department. (ground breaking for orphan rates, though)


Absolutely. ECDSA verification isn't *that* much of a problem today, and with libsecp256k1 it's gonna be a breeze.
That is, for continual validation. Initial sync is gonna suck, and it's always gonna suck, whether it's always gonna suck *more* is down to whether we allow for huge blocks that grow much faster than technology can keep up with. Initial sync scales like O(n^k), where k is the rate of growth of blocks - this is a particularly bad one to endure. So long as we still want to be able to validate everything should this remain an important consideration.
*(Personally, I think we can afford to let this last bit slide a little; you can safely join the network having only fully validated, say, the last year - this is already true with checkpoints. Now that headers-first is a thing we can safely throw away the checkpoints and replace them with a dynamic and peer-to-peer equivalent. As a consequence, full one-time validation of everything down to genesis will 'just' be expensive.)*
Either way, as far as CPU capacity goes; we have plenty - I don't think we'll run into this bottleneck before running into RAM, and I don't think RAM is a problem either. So yeah.

So let's take a step back and look at what OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY actually is with regards to 'consensus' of the network:
It is a soft fork rule (that is: a consensus rule that does not introduce any contradiction to all existing consensus rules, meaning it is backward compatible) addition that adds restrictive behavior to the existing OP_NOP2 opcode (which is now renamed to OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY).
OP_NOP2 is currently ignored during Script execution, meaning the opcode has no behavior and doesn't invalidate the transaction: it does nothing. It is also currently non-standard, meaning miners wouldn't mine it by default (though that isn't all that important for this explanation). OP_CSV adds restrictive behavior to this opcode, meaning if some condition isn't met, the transaction will be made invalid (ie. a transaction cannot be included if the CSV period hasn't yet passed)
This new rule is currently _not being enforced_ by any node on the network (meaning: it doesn't yet exist), nor will it, until all participants in the network start observing and enforcing it. In order for that to happen successfully, the soft fork needs to be 'activated' in such a way that all participants in the network start enforcing it at the same time.
It's important that the entire network starts enforcing the new rules at the same time (block height) because otherwise we can end up forking the blockchain (in the case of soft forks this is primarily under adversarial conditions) causing people to lose money, be reorganised out, be vulnerable to double spends, etc. Consensus generally breaks down when participants on the network don't agree on the same rules, so it's important that we do, which particularly presents us with a problem when we want to do (soft fork) upgrades such as OP_CSV.
For soft forks, we can 'get away' with _only_ miners enforcing new rules in the short term, because miners are the only participants in the network that can create blocks, and any adversarial minority miner is quickly 'kicked off' the network if it does not agree to enforce a soft fork rule addition. (in this last case, unupgraded nodes will validate and accept a then-invalid block, but other miners and upgraded nodes will not, causing that block to be reorganised out of the [old] blockchain, which serves to 'protect' unupgraded nodes)
We used to do network-wide simultaneous soft fork activation via ISM (IsSuperMajority), which allowed us to define a soft fork, roll it out, signal for it by increasing the block version number, and activate it on a 95% supermajority. It worked fine, we used it for BIP34 (height in coinbase) and BIP66 (strict DER signatures) and BIP65 (OP_CLTV), but it has some problems in that it was very inflexible, didn't have a revocation or expiration signal, and destroys usable 'bits' in the version field.
BIP9 is designed to replace that (ISM) simultaneous activation mechanism, and is what is being used to roll out OP_CSV with:
BIP 9 signaling describes that a soft fork rule be activated when 95% of the last 2016 blocks (counted every 2016 blocks) signal for support, by setting the relevant (and pre-defined) bit in the version field.
In other words, when 95% of miners signal they support OP_CSV, the part of the network that has upgraded to understand OP_CSV will, only then, start enforcing the soft fork rule. If it never gets to 95%, it will not activate under those conditions.
So. This all sounds a whole lot like voting, right? After all, it only works when miners agree by, essentially, making their vote known. And we seem to need a certain percentage of miners to do so before it all works. Why, then, isn't it voting?
_(note that this all might sound a bit philosophical)_:
Miners aren't the entities that can make a decision to change anything in this system, because they are not the entities that give value to it. Bitcoin is money. Money is given value by individuals that use it. And this particular money is being used by these individuals to pay miners for securing its past (proof-of-work), and molding its present (dispute mediation in the form of filling blocks with transactions). Therefore, users have power over miners by choosing them to do this job, and by giving value to the money used to pay them.
Users can choose to 'employ' a different group of miners (for example by changing the Proof-of-Work algorithm) if the current group does not seem to cater to their whim (for example by refusing to activate a soft fork for no reason)
A sword can only be effective when a swordsman wields it.
Users appear to have already agreed on rolling out OP_CSV. It doesn't seem to be met with any contention by anyone participating in the economy, it is sufficiently reviewed, the code is available, tested, the activiation mechanism is defined and agreed upon. The soft fork is ready, its rollout is ongoing. All that's left is its simultaneous activation. And all we need for that to happen the way we'd like it to happen (that is, peacefully via BIP 9), is for 95% of miners to signal that they will.
We're not waiting for votes; the decision has been made. We merely wait for signals. And if the signals don't come, the signaleer shall change.
This general sentiment is also described in BIP 2:
@_date: 2015-10-24 19:56:08
The problem I have with BIP 101 is the 40% annual increase. Nielsen's (as well as Moore's) law is being relied upon to greatly, they haven't been in touch with reality for a while now; I don't think it's a good measure to follow in Bitcoin.
BIP103's goal is to follow realistic technological trends and development from a slightly conservative approach, which I think is the better option here - even though it may perhaps have taken a too pessimistic set of data points to base itself upon; I think ~25% (rather than 17) is suitable as Rusty showed. (I also think an initial block size bump under 103 to either 4 or 8 MB is warranted)
I don't think testing four years into the future is very relevant when we're talking about a 30-year bi-annual doubling schedule that's stretching even the most optimistic of trends (Moore's, Nielsen's) that *already* are starting to fall apart.

Yes, you still need to update the display address.
Using a HD architecture you can generate multiple private keys out of the same seed deterministically. It also gives you an ['xpubkey', or 'public parent key']( which you can use to generate a unique and unlinked (from the outside) *public key* (but no private key - yet) for each person wishing to send you money. It's safer to store this key on a potentially unsafe server, because the public parent key (as opposed to the private parent key) does not allow you to generate private (child) keys - in other words, when the this public seed gets stolen, your money is still safe ^(although you should still move it).
So the idea is: You have your private seed, and you secure it as usual. You have your public parent key, you stick it on the server you're using to get donations, and you generate addresses out of it when someone wants to pay you. Then when you want to use the received money, you use your local secured private seed to spend it.
If you want donations on a different address but you can't update the displayed address (ie. you're a street artist and your payment address is a printed out QR code): tough beans, can't use HD wallets for this. Maybe when the Lightning Network comes along this'll be easier.

It's all within the realm of possibility, and all it takes are people who are willing and able to implement it, and there's plenty of those.
Bitcoin isn't closed, it's open. Unlike *all other* methods of currency transfer, additional methods of transfer may be developed independently, frictionlessly and without permission by anyone.

There's already minrelaytxfee: a local node policy setting; low-fee transactions will not properly propagate over the network if a large number of nodes have a minrelaytxfee that is higer.

Admirable, really.
Seeing that you're advocating for proposals that go over 32MB. Have you also tested for 32, 64, 128MB and following iterations? - as that would maybe yield some data that's actually useful to your argument. see ie.

It wouldn't mitigate the first. If miners collude with a fraudster the network would never know a transaction is being double spent until the block shows up, which is when it's too late.
The last point could be solved by replace-by-fee-scorched-earth, which is that a merchant, in response to a double-spend attempt, would double-spend the double-spend using an even higher fee, which would eventually render the payment nil. It would cost the fraudster the full amount, and the merchant would get nothing. Idea being: no incentive for a fraudster to fraud. Whether that'll work: meh. The idea is very interesting, but as far as I'm concerned it's not ideal. More here in this (recent) argument by Mike Hearn:

Can't create a public key without also knowing the private key; voters need to come up with a public key themselves.


Unless voting is mandatory, this will only prove no pubkeys have been added.




Breaks voter anonymity.
Regardless of anything, it wouldn't make that much sense to vote using a blockchain in the way we think of bitcoin and transactions today. It's much more efficient to use a top-layered protocol which collaboratively constructs a merkle tree of votes (which needn't be in the transaction format we're familiar with) and commit to an actual (bitcoin) blockchain only at the key-points of the voting cycle, where proof of something needs to be recorded (not individual votes; the full batch - as the merkle root). This can even be centrally coordinated (note: not controlled) which determines the ordering in the tree or something; no need to have consensus on the order of events like in Bitcoin.

An audit trail is, as they say, only the first of many steps required before we can pride ourselves with a secure and efficient voting system that is provably fair.
The problem with 'blockchain voting' or, really, any sort of auditable cryptographic voting system is the problem where you need to preserve both voter anonymity while also ensuring votes have not been doubly cast, or non-existent votes have been cast.
Either one or the other is trivial, but to have both is hard. If you can prove all votes are legitimate, you can also prove *your* vote is legitimate; allowing this defeats voter anonymity, indirectly allowing for voter coercion. Conversely, having voter anonymity implies you cannot prove that votes are legitimate, meaning you can have illegitimate votes in your results.
I'm pretty sure much of the work Gregory Maxwell did on confidential transactions (rather the work it's based on), which, essentially, allows you to evaluate basic arithmetic without seeing the values, and still knowing the eventual answer presented is correct, can be used to end up with a secure cryptographic voting system that checks all the 'proper voting system' boxes.
(in Bitcoin terms: you create a transaction which represents your vote, your 'account' contains 1 vote which is visible, your transaction defines an output for each person on the ballot with an CT-like 'encrypted' amount value. Only one of which contains your one vote, the others are an encrypted 0. Given many voters will completely obfuscate who voted on who, while still allowing anyone to prove the aggregate votes received per person are the actual amount)

Don't forget the full validation bit; their most important task.


When mining on p2pool or as a solo miner, you need to run a node.
When mining on a (small) pool (stratum), you don't, and you receive none of the benefits a full node offers; you are completely in the dark over the contents you are mining and whether it is valid - such a miner isn't even aware whether the system functions correctly.


While a higher, faster increase would limit Bitcoin's decentralisation, security and, with it, its utility?


Bitcoin Core is not Bitcoin - Bitcoin Core developers do not define consensus, they only take part in it.


Consensus is the state of a situation where everyone participating agrees. It is not moving alongside the whim of Bitcoin Core's development or any other software.


I'll do it for you. It's XT.


Would you say this is a good method for developing software that runs the backbone of a global decentralized monetary system?


That's hardly a reason for Bitcoin - a wholly different type of software - to follow in line.
Before L. Torvalds invented GIT there was SVN. He refused to employ it in his own project, the Linux kernel, because SVN was entirely unsuitable for a project such as Linux. Instead, he reluctantly merged changes others contributed to his project through a much older, and much more inefficient system. The system was called e-mail.
Only after he designed a proper solution to the version control problem his software project faced, did he switch over. GIT has been one of the greatest advancements in open source software development since. Had he followed 'pretty much all other software' and used SVN - that may never have happened, and Linux may have been an entirely different project altogether.
Because others are doing one thing doesn't automatically mean you have to follow suit for no reason - other than the sake of following suit.


Plenty is happening. Not rolling out a solution is a very far cry away from no notable activity or progress or analysis into coming to one.

What I was saying that proof-of-work *doesn't* depend on time directly. If, however, the block time (which is one of its headers) deviates too greatly from what's been somewhat agreed to be the network adjisted time, it will be rejected. As I said.
I said we cannot depend on time *directly*, this is the entire reason decentralized consensus systems will not work and will never work so long as it depends on time. Proof-of-work, on the other hand, solves this by allowing for a loose grip on time, while allowing for a great amount of certainty in the ordering of events.
What you're saying is true; blocks deviating from your own time and the timestamo reported in the block are rejected. But that does not mean we depend on time directly, or concretely.

See this for a short write-up on what's happened in the past and where we stand currently:
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:22:06
It's just an extra opcode in the scripting language that resolves whether or not a transaction is valid.
This new opcode allows outputs/redeemscripts to specify whether or not to check the locktime explicitly. The locktime is an existing concept in a transaction, but you currently can't interact with it via Script. This soft fork enables that.
It isn't any clever maths, nor is it a boolean flag in the p2p protocol. It's just new behaviour in the scripting language that is enforced through consensus.
It is impossible to crack so long as consensus over this rule remains, which you can trivially be sure of by running a node. There's no introduction of trust.
(Well, to be precise, there's edge cases where you can be defrauded if all of the following are true: you accept currently-non-standard transactions as payment; you refuse to upgrade; the fraudster is willing to expend work on creating an invalid block; *and* you accept payment after a single confirmation -- sooo yeah)

I didn't say bitcoin doesn't use time, though. It's integral, but we don't use it *directly*, because we can't. We use *work*, and proof thereof, to come to consensus. Time is part of this as a function, but we cannot depend on it directly.

For soft forks you'd only need miners to support a change.
Like this soft fork, which describes the voting process nicely: 
I'm not sure if old nodes always would have relayed v2 blocks or not. Looks like they did otherwise it'd have been a hard fork.
A hard fork requires all participants to upgrade because it introduces previously unknown behavior.

I get what you're saying now.
I argue that by computing the result of some deterministic algorithm you will not have predicted it, you will have determined it.


The next block isn't, but the result of a SHA256 computation is. I should clarify here what I mean by the outcome of such a computation being unpredictable. You *cannot predict* the outcome of the computation *without actually doing the computation* (this where our argument derails). You can look at the input a million different ways but derive no information about what the output might look like. Not until you perform the calculation do you know the outcome. I argue that this makes a thing unpredictable.
I understand this seems hugely oxymoronic, but I fear I cannot explain it any differently.
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:00:32
At every halving, much of the supply simply disappears.
If demand remains the same, the price must inevitably rise.
Whether miners turn off their machines because they can no longer make ends meet is irrelevant, because the mining reward will still have halved, and supply will still have shrinked.
It's often suggested early speculation would fulfill this prophecy well before the halving.
That's all assuming none of the network's sentiment changes, and a reduction of supply by halving the mining reward is the only thing that changes.
@_date: 2015-03-20 10:29:59
That isn't necessarily true. The effort required to process/secure a low-value transaction versus a high-value transaction is the exact same. It doesn't make sense, from a technical perspective, to charge them any differently.
Mining will _always_ be profitable (regardless of whether it's profit as in money, or something else, such as the value of a secure ledger). If it isn't then miners will stop mining, difficulty adjusts, and the system will, once again, tend toward profitability. This will always be the case. We don't _have to_ change the way the fee system works for bitcoin to _survive_. _If_ we have to / want to change it, it will be because we agree an increase (or decrease) of the security of the ledger is warranted.

The network says it's OK, and the miners mine it, after which the network says it's OK again.
Actually the behavior in the case where the condition is passed is the exact same as it is today, the difference is that you *can't* spend coins if the new condition is *not* passed (whereas you can today - the new conditional doesn't yet exist).

Bear in mind it's already in Bitcoin Core, has been since 0.10 - it's currently being used to sign all transactions. Not a single hick-up, and no reason to think it will.


It has been vetted objectively from a mathematical perspective, multiple times over. While it's true there can always be bugs, in anything, the same is true for OpenSSL - and I think it's fair to say this library has been more extensively tested (although of course, part of testing this library has also been to extensively test OpenSSL) than OpenSSL. I would feel comfortable enough using either one, but more comfortable using libsecp256k1.

They're actually only incentivized to spam the mempool if users use naive and broken fee estimation algorithms.
The optimal algorithm doesn't even look at the mempool, nor block history. It 'tries' a low fee transaction, then replaces it with a higher fee as it observes that the transaction does not confirm. When it does, you can be sure you have paid near the optimal fee.
The result of this is that every transaction miners spam, costs as much in opportunity cost as it inflates the fees. Dropping the incentive for doing it.

Nodes relay zero-fee (non-standard?) transactions up to a certain limit if I recall correctly.
They're fine with it so long as it isn't getting annoying. At some amount of 0-fee tx's nodes will say "fuck off, maybe later", but until then they'll relay just fine.
Not at all sure about the exact numbers or methods.
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:44:55
By running a full node you can be maximally confident in the transaction data contained in the blockchain, you have no external dependencies which you must ask for data/events/transactions, you can evaluate whether anything is awry, and you have a full chain of proof all the way down to genesis which you can rely on with minimal trust.
You're helping the network by making it more distributed, making it harder to go down, making it less vulnerable to attack. Especially if you're running a node that's accepting incoming connections you're also improving propagation times somewhat, and making propagation more reliable.
If you're not interested in helping the network by running a full node, which is fine, then at least when you're dealing with large sums of money, for example, it would make sense to be running a full node, or multiple. Just to be supremely confident in the state of the blockchain.

This is already possible if you tell your node to connect to something else yourself. You'll use your own 'trusted pool', but you won't have to rely on the hard-coded ones.
Most of the time the Bitcoin Core client discovers peers by doing DNS requests for various domains which will return a set of addresses to connect to.


We don't strictly *depend* on them because we can tell our node to do something else manually.

This isn't entirely clear to me, so anyone please correct me if I'm wrong.
Mnemonic phrasing is somewhat standardized in BIP39: 
But not all wallets have implemented it exactly like this BIP describes (eg. they use different word lists). I know electrum *used to* have a different word list, and I'd guess they've switched to the [correct/universal]( one for newly generated keys, but I'm not sure.
Different word lists shouldn't *have* to be a problem per sé because a valid seed may derived from sentences based on them regardless. However, whether or not a different word list was used may be detected by the checksum contained in the sentence. The software interpreting it (using a different word list) will consider the provided sentence invalid and may not allow you to use it for a seed, or it may just warn you. In practice, the former is true.
Here's the part I'm especially unclear about:


I don't know if all wallets that have BIP39 support have implemented seed generation exactly the way described here. If they have, then *in theory* they will support importing any phrase and extracting the same seed. That's assuming they will allow you to import sentences of which the checksum doesn't check out, or sentences which are in another way different from what they themselves would generate (like its length), which they likely won't.
// Edit - No, unless implemented exactly the same, or support for different implementations has been added explicitly.

Well you must never have investigated what a node actually does if that's what you believe.
Query a node, what it'll return is either valid or an error.


Again. I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding the primary task of a fully validating node. For the *network* to function, all you need is a single high performance *honest* node. Emphasis on honest. There are many of those because running a full node allows the operator to be sure their own node is honest, whereas if they didn't they would have to trust that the network is. Remember, this being a decentralised system, there's nobody that can guarantee you the system works correctly other than yourself.


I'm not talking about mining decentralization. And bear in mind miner costs aren't the only costs this network consumes.


You're implying SPV is a realistic alternative for those who are using a full node - economically dependent validators, while the reality is that it is not. SPV isn't private, nor is it secure, nor is it without trust. You can't expect the network to move to them and abandon fully validating, while also saying security and decentralisation will not be affected.


As it happens, Luke-jr NACK'ed BIP16's P2SH. Guess what we're stuck with today? BIP16 P2SH. And incidentally, had his NACK been sufficiently ACKnowledged, there's a good chance we'd have the in-hindsight-much-better BIP17 today.
I agree the governance model of Bitcoin Core makes for an extremely conservative progression forward, however, I dare you to entertain the thought this might not be a bad thing.


Satoshi was perhaps the best benevolent dictator any starting project could wish for, and Bitcoin in particular. He was some guy with a mind that aligns well with Bitcoin fundamentals and a gift for cryptographic systems that *nobody has ever knowingly stood in the same room with*.
Do you not see how ridiculous it sounds that the only software running a decentralized monetary system is ruled by a dictator? Benevolent or otherwise? Satoshi being anonymous was the one thing that kept the system from corrupting. Gavin's decision to change the governance model of the software to the way it has ended up today is one decision I entirely support.
Here's a simple 3-step program to corrupt Bitcoin under the benevolent dictator governance model:
- Abduct dictator family
- Commence death threats
- Profit
Then again, I guess it's a good thing we have many independent fully validating nodes that would not allow for such a thing to happen.
You know, the funny thing is. In practice, wumpus is the de-facto benevolent dictator you describe - he makes *all* decisions over what and what not to merge into the Core software. There's just a thorough peer-review process that precedes his doing his job, and a ton of people to revoke his merge privilege in case of failure. What's funny about this, is that his 'executive decision' into not merging anything related to the block size because the proposed solutions aren't very likable conflicts with your own beliefs over what needs doing.
As a result, you think the Core software is a car that's entrenching itself further into a pile of mud, and you're arguing the car is the problem - not the mud.

They do, but nodes don't depend on their own clock or on others' clock, which my be false, but instead rely on the timestamps reported in the blocks, which could only have been accepted if the network (including themselves) agreed the time was valid at that time.

Miners often aggregate into pools which distribute work for each miner to perform. While each pool must run a node to communicate proof of that work (valid blocks) to the rest of the network, that node will likely not be the actual miner that will have 'counted' (hashed) - but rather represent the pool as a whole.
Here are some accurate stats on where the blocks are coming from and who's mining them:

If I'm to interpret this correctly, your solution to transactions that do not take into consideration the cost they impose upon others, is to store them faster just to not let it bother you?

A (hugely) lagging difficulty adjustment time, I believe, is a good thing for the network. With such a lagging adjustment time it's much more costly to perform an attack where you isolate a node, or a set of nodes, from the network - allowing you to essentially double spend anything on their fake version of the blockchain which you provide majority mining power for. The more the difficulty lags, the more costly this attack becomes.

A hard limit of 1MB was misguided though. It would've been prudent to implement something like what Gavin's proposed now, rather than forcing the network to hard fork in the future just to get rid of the change.

Bottom line is, you don't want to give voting power like this (dynamically increasing block size limit) to miners. You don't want to arbitrarily decide what voting percentages are acceptable for the network, because in different situations they might not be. We're doing consensus here. All for one, and one for all. All that goodness.
The 'consensus solution' would be to agree to a block size limit schedule we either all control, or we all don't control (like agreeing to double the limit anually).
Even if your proposal requires miner collusion (which is only true for artificially increasing the limit, not permanently locking the limit) or costly attacks (which may be a drop in the pond to an attacker) is irrelevant when the alternative is vulnerable to neither / none.

By having the full blockchain you'll be able to determine, beyond doubt and without trust, that every single thing in there is valid and compliant with the consensus rules set by the network.
Anything less than the full blockchain requires you to trust peers, if even a little. This can be acceptable for a great many applications. But if you want absolute certainty, having the full blockchain at some point is the only way.
Once you've fully verified the entire blockchain once you could start running a pruning node instead, meaning you can discard many historic blocks and a great many (&gt;80% or so) fully spent transactions. You'll be left with a set of data well under a gigabyte; very light-weight.
What you're suggesting, though, is not unheard of. You could ask (pruning) nodes to store, in addition to recent blocks, all blocks whose hash ends with some given/random (configurable) amount of bits, for example. And implement a routing mechanism on top of that not unlike TCP/IP routing which nodes may use to be served the full chain - through only pruning nodes. This would lessen the strain on full/archival nodes if we ever find ourselves in a situation where little full nodes and many pruning nodes exist.
None of that is being implemented yet, though, seeing that there's little need for it currently.
@_date: 2015-10-09 14:16:18
Asking nodes whether a limit is suitable is vulnerable to a Sybil attack.
If it were possible and safe to expect nodes to be honest, then mining would not be needed for the network to come to consensus without trust. This expectation does not safely exist, therefore any proposal that 'asks' nodes to make a decision is a non-starter.

You're *sort of* right this scales like O(n * m), but also not.
Under the realistic assumption that m is or should be some fraction of n, you'll - by eliminating constants as per the definition of big-O notation - end up with O(n^2).
Only by abandoning the concept where m is some fraction of n - and implicitly committing to the line of thought where Bitcoin is ever centralizing into m - does O(n * m) hold true.
Frankly, I think if Bitcoin *isn't* going to scale like O(n^2) it will set a bad precedent for the decentralisation and security of the system. Now, I think we can easily endure a huuge bump in *n*, but I would not eagerly overdo it and potentially end up in a much more centralized position.
Small and safe steps that are sufficient and offer perspective have my preference here.

Bitcoin core is a software implementation of the bitcoin protocol.
It's often called the reference client, because in many ways the protocol itself is written down in this implementation's code, hence *reference* client.
The code for Bitcoin Core is here: 
It is a full node and an (optional) wallet, and an optional miner. It was the first implementation of the bitcoin protocol and was first created by Satoshi some 6 years ago, and improved upon since. The latest version is 0.10.
Many forks and many alternative implementations exist, although as far as nodes go, vanilla Bitcoin Core (v0.8, v0.9 and v0.10) is the most prevalent.




Literally nobody can stop you from creating your own flavour of a bitcoin client and patching it into the network.
But if that client deviates from consensus rules in ways that other nodes in the network will not agree or will not understand, your client will be rejected and you will run your own alternative version of bitcoin.
You will not ruin the whole thing with your shitty code for this reason. You can go wild.


Consensus does. Whatever the majority of peers in the network agree to is what bitcoin, the protocol, is.
Bitcoin Core itself (which is *just* an implementation of the protocol), however, is maintained mainly by a group of developers which are implementing and proposing changes to the client, and the protocol. They can decide when to release new versions for Bitcoin Core and what those versions will and will not include, but the peers - the users which are participating in the bitcoin network - are the ones who decide what they themselves are running, and with it, what the majority is running.

Sure, when/if quantum computers are a reality going from pubkey to privkey appears to be trivial with Shor's. I'm talking specifically about going from address to pubkey, for which Grover's seems to be the most practical.


How is it you can 'treat them as one'?
Let's replace RIPEMD with another hashing algorithm, just for kicks. Let's call this hashing algorithm CRAP160.
It goes like this:
- Take the first 160 bits of the data you're hashing
- This is your hash
It's a somewhat valid hashing algorithm, not very secure, but valid nonetheless.
Finding a collision for a CRAP160 hash is rather trivial, it goes like this:
- Take the hash
- Add bits, or don't.
- This is your collision
Anyone and their dog can 'crack' this hashing algorithm in their sleep.
So, to create an address from the pubkey, you'd now do this CRAP160(SHA256(pubkey))
Seeing that in this scheme the CRAP160 algorithm is worthless and obviously the weakest link, surely going from address to pubkey is trivial now, right? Wrong.
Then how is only the "the RIPEMD-160 Grover problem" the *only* hurdle to overcome. There's still SHA256, security of which has been reduced to 160 bits, sure, but still a hell of a lot more than "nah, we can skip it".

In practice, nothing will happen; everything will remain as it is because there is no consensus for change, thus nothing will change.
But let's say we're divided 50/50, half wants the block size limit to remain, the other half wants it to go away. Both sides are hell-bent on getting their way, and neither side is willing to compromise. So the anti-block-limit side flips a switch allowing for big-ass-blocks and what happens next is exactly what the name implies: The network will fork.
There would be 2 chains running in parallel and in disagreement with eachother from the moment a single block over 1MB is broadcast and accepted by one side, but not the other.
As for utility, coins will exist on both chains, and (new) transactions may also exist / be mined on both chains. As users, we would (in theory) actually be able to use both chains for some (short) time. However, it would be possible for some transactions to be mined on one chain, but not on the other. Every time that happens the two chains deviate further and further away from eachother because they will have less and less shared unspent outputs. At some point the two chains will be completely separate.
What would happen in terms of value of the chains; who knows. Exchanges, processors, merchants, users, etc. would have to pick and choose a chain they agree with. Traders will flip their shit. Prices would most likely plummet.
Block times would double because mining power is split in half, and miners of one chain could attack the other.
Absolute chaos. We'd implode. And both sides will be sad when the dust settles.
Which is why a hard fork is either gonna happen in consensus, or it's not gonna happen at all.

The coin amount introduced to the network over a given period changes as miners turn on and off their machines in between the time it takes the network to retarget the difficulty every ~2 weeks (2016 blocks)
The network aims for the block time to be about 10 minutes on average, which is inexact given the fact that the network hashrate both changes over time and cannot be precisely measured (though it can be approximated quite accurately, which is what it's doing). If the actual hashrate is higher than what's been targeted, the average block time will be &lt;10 minutes, if it's lower it'll be &gt;10 minutes. Every block introduces (currently) 25 BTC to the system, so at lower block times the amount generated per day will be &gt;3600, and at higher block times it will be &lt;3600.
Check out this chart: 
If the green/blue/grey lines are above the red one, then more coins are being created in a given period than targeted, if the lines are below the red one, then less coins will be created in the same period.
It'll all average out eventually and tend toward 3600 (25 * 6 * 24) coins generated per day (at current block reward value, which halves every 4 years at the great halving ritual).

Well it isn't *that* black and white.
Say there's a fort knox type super-impenetrable vault. It'll cost 20 million in equipment and super-expertise to get in there.
Let's use it to secure 50 thousand bars of gold. Is it secure?
Let's use it to secure a cubic metre of common dirt. Is that more, less, or equally secure?
Different use cases have different security even with equivalent measures put in place. As they say:


It's entirely reasonable to (partly) forego extravagant and expensive physical security and replace it with relatively cheap alternatives like tamper-resistant measures such as devices like this so long as the potential loot isn't worth the effort of tampering. It can benefit a huge amount of business where security isn't directly or obviously key, for little extra effort or cost.
Besides, it isn't like this is an either/or situation. These measures can go hand-in-hand without trouble.


I doubt it's RFID and nothing else. I'd suspect there's something like this in there  or some other active authentication mechanism. But who knows (for now).

Not quite. At low block confirmation times, base network latency comes into play much more significantly - you can expect orphan rates to rise and reorganisations at the tip to occur more frequently. If the confirmation time is pushed down too far, it would be completely possible for the network to reorganise the chaintip much farther and deeper (in time) than is currently the case - indefinitely even.
I would also suspect a single or even multiple confirmations at a 1.25 minute average confirmation time can be perceived to be meaningless, defeating the 'secondary' benefit to lower confirmation times.

Apart from being wrong on how bitcoin works on a technical level, you're also wrong on the definition of fungibility.
I can piss and shit all over my dollar bills, and when I'm done they are worth the exact same. I can sell drugs and bombs for dollar bills, and those dollar bills which I've received for my illegal goods will be worth exactly what they say on the paper. I can buy the exact same things with my shitty, pissy, dirty, unlaundered money as clean bills can. This is fungibility.
If, though, I'm paying for stuff with my drugged up, shat on, crap bills, I may raise some bells when I'm paying with them. I may have to account for the origins of those bills, explain why it's not because of an illegal transaction on my part, and perhaps lead the relevant authorities to the one responsible for an illegal transaction, if not me. But whatever the case, those dollar bills will have lost none of its value.
Just because a currency is traceable doesn't make them any less fungible. Dollar bills, too, are completely traceable, them having serial numbers and all kind of facilitates in that. And bitcoin is, in many ways, the same. Completely traceable. Yet dollar bills are somehow fungible, and bitcoins are not?
Both are fungible. The dollar because the law says it's so, bitcoin because consensus says it's so. So, essentially, for the same reason; community.
What makes them fungible is us, the users, the community, society, whatever, making them so.

This is the primary argument I make for why volatility doesn't have to be a blocking problem for a currency.
"It can never work because the currency is too volatile; one day I can buy one loaf of bread, the other I can buy 2, or half."
That's untrue, and it doesn't matter so long as that currency is the unit of account for a given economy.
Most europeans don't even know the value of the euro has dropped that much: prices have remained roughly the same. You can go about your day without a decrease in purchasing power even though your currency has dropped in value against some other thing (the dollar), because 'the other thing' is largely irrelevant while buying groceries or anything in your local euro based economy.
Equivalently, in a bitcoin based or bitcoin backed economy, the value of bitcoin as a whole isn't gonna matter all that much.

If there's a way to succesfully (without being a (majority) miner) double spend an unconfirmed transaction then any network is insecure and unreliable until the first confirmation. If that's the case then in the end nothing is feasible for use in the real world because I will never wait for a transaction to confirm before taking my cup of coffee from the counter, whether that's 5 seconds, a minute, or 10. As such, confirmation times mean nothing in this regard.

Miners can do it at no cost. Whether they all would, or why, is beside the point.
Anyone else would be looking at $50 000 or so worth of bitcoin for 1000 blocks at current limits / fee policy / exchange price to saturate blocks. Creating a 1GB block would cost roughly the same, but it would be sudden rather than stretched out (which of those options is worse is debatable).
Either way, something that's predictable and deterministic trumps something that's not (as much), in my opinion.

And as I said, such a scheme would utterly ruin all hope of anything resembling privacy. Let alone the fact that all users are now not validating the money they own.
You can't just move to a client-server model to begin with, one where considerable strain is put on the server such that a typical client can in no way replicate its function. A subscription model is only resistant to corruption when individuals can independently and at a reasonable cost check and possibly replace the server. Ie. the current model.
A subscription model is like saying "independent journalism is for suckers, it should be enough for everyone to watch CNN to get their news fix". You'll only encourage fake news central to arise, and a fake chain for Bitcoin. _Individuals_ must be able to validate this system, independently and to their own benefit.

BIP9 activation (and ISM also, for that matter) gave miners a role in governance; it allowed them to attempt to strongman users into giving them unrelated presents in return for activation. (For example, 2MB HF)
BIP148 and the UASF concept in general exist to correct that mistake.
When that effort is complete, all governance is by users. They hold the coins, they validate the rules. Developers (in their role as developer) have no say other than their (welcome) meritorious suggestions.

The timestamp in the block headers may deviate from the actual time  with about 2 or so hours. The only reason the timestamp is in there is so we can calculate the next difficulty change with reasonable accuracy. It's not meant to be exact, because we can't verify if it is entirely correct anyway.
And blocks only require a minimum of 1 transaction (the coinbase transaction which contains the mining reward) - if miners choose not to include any other transactions then that's their choice, they'd be missing transaction fees - potential revenue - but it's entirely up to them.

The link you referenced says the following:
    Trend 7: Impact of Accelerating Speeds on Traffic Growth
     Fixed Speeds
    Broadband speed is a crucial enabler of IP traffic. Broadband speed improvements result in increased consumption and use of high-bandwidth content and applications. The global average broadband speed continues to grow and will more than double from 2014 to 2019, from 20.3 Mbps to 42.5 Mbps.
That's a doubling in 5 years. *Nowhere near* Nielsen's law.
The graph right below it indicates a projected growth of ~15%/year for North America and Europa, and ~16% for Asia. That's even worse than BIP103!
The wikipedia link showed ~56% year-over-year increase of *traffic*, which is *not* a representative value, and in fact completely unrelated to *bandwidth*.




They will be available in many developed parts of the world, probably affordable there too. So yes. Whether 1Gbps (let's assume symmetric) is enough? Not for 8GB blocks it isn't, not by a long shot, not if you want an effective node.
Today, at minimum, we're rolling with, let's say 20Mbit (symmetric), 2.5MB/sec for good measure, worth of bandwidth needed to run a node effectively. So that's receiving a 1MB block and relaying it to a few of your peers in under 10 seconds.  Let's say we want these minimums to be the same relative to the block size limit in 21 years.
Now, these are optimistic minimum values, the reality is not this.
At 8GB blocks, this translates to a hefty 160Gbit/s *optimistic minimum* bandwidth.
Will these connections be commonwealth 21 years from now? Given the prospect Cisco, of all organisations, doesn't predict anything over 15% for the US? How about fucking no.
As a huge positive here, O(1)-like schemes will be available by this time. So we can lower this value considerably. Let's say 5x: transaction peek numbers are relevant here, and you'd ideally want a couple-second full network propagation time regardless - uniformly distributed bandwidth saturation isn't gonna cut it. So let's say 32 Gbit *symmetric* at minimum, will this be available commonly by then? Perhaps (!). Do we want to play jump-rope here? No.
BIP 101 is, unfortunate as it may be, too optimistic for a project of this magnitude.

To be honest this is the first time I'm seeing censorship I cannot explain the reason for. I'll just keep quoting:




I'm guessing you're being auto-moderated for excessive messaging or something.




You can be wrongly opinionated about the perspective for all I care, but it isn't strange at all.


If they are not mining a chain I intend to validate, presumably they aren't being paid enough to do so. Again: miners are in the employ of users; employees need to be paid.


They'll be running at a loss, but sure.


No reason to think they will have value. But that blockchain will definitely not be secure. Just look at any of the hundreds of altcoins that are hardly being mined and can be attacked by any random joe with some hashing power.


Hence they are paying miners to produce it.


Hence the importance of being in consensus with one another over the rules that make something valid or not.


Fully validating users control and define the chain, they are paying miners the privilege of minting and fee collection in exchange for curating and securing its contents.


It's the miner's business.


Users have defined the rules that govern a blockchain, and are actively auditing these rules are being followed.
I'd like to hear you explain the reason miners would not create an exuberant amount of invalid money out of thin air, sell it on an exchange, and cash out fiat, if it weren't for the fact that users (and the exchange) validate their blocks.

The initial software was full of bugs, none of which are unfixable.
The initial protocol is full of weirdness, none of which is significant.
Some protocol weirdness:
- Every hash is little endian, while integers and variables are big endian. In some sense this is OK, de-facto standards dictate that integers (in programming languages) are big endian, while crypto standards dictate hashes and such are little endian. It makes sense in a way, but the inconsistency is very annoying when you're creating software for it.
- Satoshi chose the secp256k1 curve for the digital signatures, which is a controversial curve that's not often used in any other solutions. The way some of the constants in this curve were generated aren't entirely clear as of yet, and some say the curve is 'too simple' to begin with. Not a single vulnerability has been discovered, though, and the only real hints of a vulnerability hinge on the fact the curve is either simple or unpopular. In fact, vulnerabilities in some other curves have been exposed, yet secp256k1 remains in the clear. This curve may have been an excellent choice, but controversial nonetheless.
- The genesis block coinbase transaction was not included in the unspent transaction output pool, and is, for this reason, unspendable. Including it would be a hard fork change.
Some implementation/programming weirdness:
- Coinbase transactions' scriptsigs cannot be parsed using traditional script interpretation; this scriptsig is essentially arbitrary data miners can stick in a block.
- Many (non-standard) script operations contained bugs that would've resulted in unintended behavior. They were untested and poorly implemented, yet enabled by default.
- The overflow bug allowing for the creation of millions of coins, leading to a 16-block fork (not a protocol bug)
There's tons more, but I'm not too well versed in the initial implementation.

We really can't. Your transaction isn't really confirmed after a confirmation, it just means there's about 10 minutes worth of work on top of it. If we make the confirmation, say, a minute, then it means there's a minute worth of work on top of it. One could argue about the chances of reversing a transaction at 1 minute conf. times or 10 or 30 or 600 minute confirmation times, but in the end it's gonna take either a meaningful amount of time, or trust.

To get from a public key to an address, you need to do RIPEMD(SHA256(public key))
**Question:** Am I wrong in thinking you need to find both a 256 bit origin for a 160 bit address, plus a 256 bit origin for that 'intermediate' 256 bit address to get to the public key?
Doesn't the security in an address come from *both* SHA256 and RIPEMD, rather than the weakest of those; if you break one but not the other, you still cannot derive the public key.
How does the 'RIPEMD-160 Grover problem' pose the challenge? There's still the glaring SHA256 Grover problem waiting for you when you're done with RIPEMD.

You can run it somewhat fine when you're done syncing, but it'll take days for it to catch up, and probably crash a couple dozen times due to its low RAM. To alleviate that you can rsync from another fully validating machine, you can be up and running in under an hour or so. But it'll still crash every now and again for ... reasons. Adding swap helps, but performance will sink dramatically.
I used to run one with the intention of it being a canary node; to see at what point it'd crash and for what reason. Stopped doing it because the canary died way too often.
At persisted 'stress tests' like the ones we've had the past few months, it'll crash. At higher block sizes, it'll crash. When it's tuesday, it'll crash. I don't recommend it.

Ugh, because Bitcoin for payment is so immensely useful in '3rd world' countries now? What, in your mind, are third world countries? What should they be using Bitcoin for that a 10ct transaction fee would prohibit from happening?
Should they pay for a can of clean water using a Bitcoin? They just scan a QR code and they're done right? But, of course, they can't, because the fee is now 10 cents instead of 5.
Bitcoin as a payment solution is most assuredly _not_ an option for 'third world' countries (or anywhere, for that matter).
At best, small communities in developing nations can take advantage of Bitcoin _as a money_, _not_ as payment, while they do payment with whatever form of paper currency is readily available to them. For this use case, a 10 cent transaction fee is utterly irrelevant. Same goes for the notion of using Bitcoin and a costly on-chain transaction to buy your daily starbucks coffee, by the way.

Alright then.
Here's a practical problem with your proposal:
Let's say some (but not most) miners disagree with increasing the block size limit. They will create empty / small blocks and by doing so will bar the entire network from increasing the limit. Even if the majority or even a large majority is in favour of increasing the limit, they cannot, because a small minority doesn't want it to happen.
Let's say we implement the rule such that 750 out of the last 1000 blocks must be 90% saturated in order for the block size limit to increase.
In this world, 25% of the mining power could prevent the block size limit from ever increasing.

Assuming you mean colored coins and such. Bitcoin tokens are bitcoins themselves; the token recognized by the blockchain. The blockchain itself doesn't have any knowledge of additional tokens or assets which may be defined inside it in OP_RETURN outputs or otherwise, nor does/should it care about them.
I don't see how *fungibility* of *bitcoins* would be disrupted by such assets.
What might be a problem, however, is that miners are, currently, incentivized by bitcoins, and nothing else. If tokens on top of the blockchain have a high value with a market cap far outweighing the  'market cap' of bitcoins, then the security miners are incentivized to provide may be disproportionate with the value it facilitates. This is one of the greater reasons that for any blockchain it is important to properly incentivize miners, and that, consequently, bitcoins must have value.

The coin that can be merge mined by another coin (ie. Namecoin being merge mined by Bitcoin) does the following:
- start validating Bitcoin for validity (in effect, Bitcoin becomes part of its consensus ruleset)
- allow accepting a Bitcoin PoW header as a valid Proof-of-Work for a namecoin block
- commit to the namecoin block in the Bitcoin block's coinbase transaction
At this point, it can be cryptographically proven that some amount of work was committed to the Namecoin blockchain (alongside Bitcoin's).
I'm not sure how specifically this is implemented in code or in detail, but this is the basic idea of merge mining.

Whether or not the merkle root in the headers is constructed out of actual transactions or gibberish is irrelevant, work is not disproven in either case.
The network doesn't need fully spent transactions, ever. Only the hash up to the next unspent merkle branch intersection.

Old nodes will reject &gt;1MB blocks.
Old nodes will not reject BIP34 v2 blocks, or BIP16 P2SH transactions, or BIP62 transaction spec *narrowing*.
The nutshell difference between a hard fork and a soft fork, is that hard forks expand on rules, and soft forks make rules narrower.
The latter can be enforced with only miners in consensus. The former requires a supermajority of all participants in order to happen smoothly.
BIP16 for example, is this:
For all &lt;pubkeysigs&gt; of the format
    OP_HASH160 [20_bytes_of_data] OP_EQUAL
miners must, in addition to normal script interpretation, verify if the scriptsig is of the format
    .. things like signatures .. [data_that_is_a_serialized_script]
and, if so, run that additional script (as the pubkeysig, and the signatures and such as the scriptsig). If that fails, the transaction will not be mined.
Pre-BIP16 nodes who would see such a (BIP16-invalid) transaction, however, think that transaction is entirely valid. If the scriptsig contains nothing but data which, when hashed, results in the 20-byte-hash in the output, there's no reason they'd think it's invalid, because they don't know about BIP16. 
BIP16 was a soft fork for this reason. It could be implemented with only miners in consensus. Because they are in consensus that BIP16 exists, they can enforce the rule without nodes or users or wallets or anyone knowing about it.
BIP16 (and the others) *narrowed* the consensus rules, rather than expanding them.
Increasing the block size limit would expand the consensus rules. The current rule is this:
    If block size &gt; 1MB
       reject the block
There's no way miners alone can increase this limit. They can lower it, sure. The rule would still be satisfied when miners are in consensus blocks should be, say, 512 KB. Nodes and everyone else wouldn't even have to know, all they care about is that blocks aren't greater than 1MB, which would be true even if miners agree the limit is lower than that 1MB.
The block size limit increase would, for this reason, require everyone participating in the network to agree. All nodes that don't know this increased block size limit exists will run into a wall if this is not the case. They'd start rejecting all blocks after a single block breaks their old 1MB block size rule.

The best quantum algorithm that can 'attack' a digest/hashing algorithm is Grover's, which will reduce the keyspace to 2^128 (from 2^256). Significant reduction, but somewhat safe nonetheless. Impractical but not infeasible.
Shor's algorithm can crack ECDSA (digital signatures) and potentially reduce its application to dust.

You don't need every transaction on the blockchain in order for the blockchain to still be useful. In the end, the blockchain is just a ledger which can be used to _settle_ transactions or contracts.
The fabled micropayments channels or sidechains, and even centralized mediators, would be the solution to the developing (and developed) countries for transactions/payments that are small, in high frequency, or occur within a trusted or weakly trusted environment.

At 10 minutes per block at 32 bytes committed (assuming 100% is merge mining), that would add up to 1.6MB per year. Not that bad. In terms of data/storage, several hundred of Roger's gambling site's transactions are as bad (and also introduce a much more significant validation burden which the NMC commitments don't), and he does that amount presumably daily.

don't know why your reply isn't showing up here:


Not quite: I'm not following the chain they mine. _They're_ mining the chain _I validate_. Whether or not the chain they mine is correct is what me and my full node will be double checking, because it isn't their money: for all intents and purposes, it is mine.
It is users of this network that, through their validating its activity, allow ownership of money to change in a way it considers it valid, and none other. If it were miners that everyone would be following and trusting all SPV-like, there would be literally no reason beyond honesty (which is the worst thing to rely on in a decentralised and anonymous system) for them not to cheat everyone else.
Though you're right in that last bit: the network _is_ using _them_.

_Never_ did I dictate to people what choices they should make; their freedom in choosing is absolute, and theirs wholly. I resent the notion you make here.
In the first instance, I observed a plain fact that in this SPV-only model, no [individual] users would be validating the money they own because they are for the vast majority unable to. I wasn't telling them what to do; I observed a fact. On the contrary to your claim, I _want_ them _to be able to choose_ to validate. If they want to use a custodial web wallet then that's completely fine with me, so long as they can choose to start validating instead of not being able to.
In the second instance I observed that this system is insecure and not worth a damn when users _are not able to_ validate this system, and as such in order for this system to be viable, they must _be able to_. Still not telling people what to do.
And I won't _let_ it scale? Like it is my responsibility to? I don't owe anything to you people. I want to validate this money because it is the only money that I can remotely rely on as being sound. You're damn straight I won't let it scale to its doom so that loud children can be happy for a couple minutes.
I mean, stop telling me what to do, man.
Anyway, it seems your dream as an infinitely scaling shitcoin will soon be reality, so I bid you farewell. History will show who was right.

SPV is completely unreliable if miners do not validate and/or are dishonest - which the grand majority of miners is demonstrating to be true. The entire SPV security model is "follow the miners"; logically if miners are straying from the correct path, SPV wallets will blindly follow them into it.
SPV is 'functional' so long as its users are at least aware of this.

There will be 2 coins when a majority of miners _do not_ upgrade to BIP 148.


Ideally BIP148 is the last aggressively drastic change to occur in Bitcoin, patching up a mistake made earlier when rolling out segwit via BIP9 (miners can veto), rather than what is now known as BIP8 (miners may coordinate, users decide).
Future BIP8 rollouts do not require a BIP148-style correction of miner misbehavior, and as such no more BIP148-style soft forks will happen, assuming all goes well.


What is happening is a result of miner interests and user interests being misaligned. The red flag was raised when BIP9 segwit activation failed, this is the correction.


Bitcoin aims to be extremely conservative when it comes to adopting change. When it is not sufficiently conservative to your liking, vote with your feet.

He turned into a fanatic. He (rightly) saw big blocks through a hard fork as a means to higher capacity, however when the facts were pointed out that big blocks pose a systemic risk to network security and an individual's ability to independently validate the whole blockchain, he refused to see reason.
A superior solution was in the meantime proposed, implemented, reviewed and tested, which achieved the same ends he sought at a reduced cost to security and operation cost, however he would not accept it. Even though his ends would be attained.
In effect, the means became the end. And he seeks to pursue these means, rather than the original end, at all costs. Sad.

There's no technical difference between them, ideally. However when privacy is leaked miners get to prioritise or deprioritise based on identity, rather than feerate or other technical datapoints -- this is the adversarial assumption.
Ie. when a gambling establishment always uses the same change address, and miners consider this activity spam and as a result will not include any transaction that contains that change address, then the cost to spend to that address will consequently go up.
Or when, rather than disliking gambling, a government is simply forcing miners to deprioritise / censor 'gambling' activity. Or whatever else a government might not prefer.
For this reason it is of paramount importance not to leak privacy. (Not that any of this applies to BIP44 specifically; just that when privacy is leaked in any way, the possibility of this happening is opened up)

I've actually created something similar to what you're looking for, but it's not exactly ready for any kind of release yet.
Feature you're looking for: 




// Edit, here's an animated gif: 
**// Edit2, here's a sample (stripped down) version with the hard-coded genesis block/coinbase only:**
Code here: 
It allows you to change the nonce and extraNonce (in the coinbase), time, etc. manually or automatically and it'll animate which of the bytes in the block headers change as a result of that. You won't see it on the screenshot but it'll simulate 4 hashes per second and visualize it through animation. It'll also keep up with the rest of the network.
Haven't released it yet because the application as a whole is supposed to be a fully fledged block explorer (for blocks and transactions, not addresses) you can run on top of a node, which is far from finished and mostly untested. Also none of the BIPs have been implemented.

This is one of the best questions about how the blockchain or a decentralized consensus system works that I've read in some time.
The solution to what you're describing is the very thing that makes bitcoin revolutionary.
The Bitcoin network has a very different grip on time than traditional systems have. Since we can never agree on exactly what time it is in a decentralized system, we cannot directly agree on when it's been 10 minutes since the last block.
The solution is proof of work, the consensus algorithm that runs the network. Instead of depending on time, we depend on an amount of work that must be performed before we can accept a block. The work performed is a function of time * effort. Where effort is expressed as calculations performed by miners (SHA256 hashes specifically) and time is calculated as the amount of effort the network performs in about 10 minutes.
This is what miners do.
So instead of agreeing on what time it is, we agree on the amount of work to perform which will loosely take 10 minutes to complete.
On time itself, we have a very accepting concept, called the network adjusted time. This is the average time of your own clock, and the clock of all peers you're connected to (which they may be lying about). If this deviates from your own clock for more than 4 hours or so, something's up and you disconnect from those peers. Every block must be within 2 or so hours from the network adjusted time, otherwise it will be rejected.
The block time is later used to adjust the difficulty of the work that must be performed, every 2016 blocks.
And that is how bitcoin reaches consensus about the ordering and timing of blocks.

Fractional reserve banking doesn't *really* increase the money supply, only artificially. What happens in a fractional reserve banking system, is that 2+ people are the owner of the same money, at the same time.
Say I'm a guy with $2million dollars in the bank, which does fractional reserve banking. They assume that I'm not gonna come a-knocking to withdraw my money from them any time soon, so instead of keeping it safe for me in their titanium vaults, they lend it out to a guy who wants to build a house, with interest. At that time, the money belongs to me, and to the guy who's building a house. The guy who's building a house established a contract with my bank saying that he'll give the money back at some later date, + interest.
The same amount of money still exists in the system, except instead of sitting idle in the bank's vaults, it's been reintroduced into the economy for some agreed-upon period of time.
Effectively, the money supply has been increased by 2 million dollars. But the money hasn't been created out of thin air, it's just that multiple people own it at the same time.
This is fractional reserve banking put simply.
This is not exclusive to inflationary currencies. The exact same scheme can still happen in a deflationary currency like bitcoin, or gold.
What's inflationary about the dollar and any such fiat, is that it allows for money to be *created* out of thin air. Money that didn't exist previously, now does. This *doesn't* happen through schemes like fractional reserve banking, it happens through schemes like quantitative easing, printing cash or counterfeiting.


If we want a reserve banking system to happen in bitcoin, we can. It's a system that does allow for economic stimulation. But **fractional** reserve banking is probably not gonna fly for most bitcoin users. It's a system that can be terribly abused and it involves a great deal of trust in the bank which is lending out *your* money. I'd rather have something more similar to full-reserve banking, where I sort of 'lock' my money for a bank or anything to lend out, and where I get part of the interest. It's essentially the same, but I won't have access to my money for an agreed-upon time. This way my 'stale' money is still being reintroduced into the economy, creating value and allowing economic stimulation, but there aren't 2+ people that have access to it.
Fractional reserve banking doesn't fully allow this, because it doesn't 'lock' funds. I can still collect my $2 million dollars which the bank lent out. The bank would pay me out of their own pocket, while they proceed to collect interest off the money I gave them previously, but they won't be as 'solvent' (not the correct term, but ah) as they were previously. If enough people did this (bankrun), at some point the bank wouldn't have any money to give, people get upset, bank would go under. Or, if modern trends persist, be bailed out by the taxpayer. It is for this reason (bankruns at fractional reserve banks) that atrocities such as deposit guarantees exist; eliminating all risks for depositors and allowing them to put their money in the worst possible institutions at no cost.


This doesn't increase the money supply. It increases the divisibility of money. It's like saying you can divide a penny by another hundred.

BlockStream funds a plethora of devs at least part-time including Pieter Wuille, Greg Maxwell, Mark Friedenbach
Eric Lombrozo is self-funded through his company Ciphrex.

Even if information is readily available to all economic participants, does not mean each participant interprets the information the same way, which would otherwise cause each participant to also act in the same way.

Without reviewing the BIP, it seems the chain they are talking about is a chain of hierarchically generated addresses, not of blocks on the blockchain. With this logic, they are both 'on the blockchain'. The difference is internal bookkeeping of the wallet (change addresses are generated one way, receiving addresses are generated another -- but both 'types' are expressed the same way when broadcast).
Ideally there's no difference, and they're treated equally (all other things also being equal). Any difference there might be would be a result of censorship or leaking privacy.

You act as though these developers are your ruler. Like the politicians (s)elected into office, whose rule must be checked rather than abolished. There is no reason at all to subject your action to others' desires or preferences in this system. Governance of Bitcoin is dictated by users, not those who may or may not represent them.
The idiots at r/btc are correct in one way only, and that is wanting not to be ruled. Their fault, much like yours, is identifying 'Core' as an entity that rules, while it demonstrably is not. (Another much more stressing fault is instead to blindly follow a ruler of another variety, in a crusade to topple the rule of their perceived enemy). However, as people hail them as 'maintainers' or even 'captains' of this wild project, that position gets less defendable. Core does not, and cannot, rule.
