Correct, I meant that if you don’t do any crypto to crypto, the process is more simple.

Go with your instinct.
I wouldn’t be surprised, McAfee often acts like a shady character when it comes to the crypto currency space.
Be careful and keep up the good work my man. ����

Lol, I advise you to familiarize yourself with US digital currency tax obligations.
Coinbase fully cooperates regarding of income disclosure. 
I advice you to report any income earned from digital currency to the IRS and just pay your taxes. If you hold the currency for &gt;1 year, your tax percentage will decrease.
Paying taxes is not that bad, just keep track of how much fiat you spend and how much you pull out.
There are other rules about calculating taxes when doing crypto to crypto transfers yada yada, I prefer to keep it simple; put cash in - pull cash out after &gt;1 year - pay your taxes on the difference - repeat.

It seems as if Bitfi is looking to work with Ryan and have a more white hat event.
However, I thought they threatened him already over his previous comments (could be mistaken).

Nor do I.
I don’t think you were out of line at all, you were just stating a fact.
However, see rules 5, 6, and 7 of this sub. One could interpret your comment as such and issue a ban.
Just looking out for you

Depends on how large the block is. With a large enough block one can fit $100k+ into a single block reward.
For non-mining nodes, there’s SPV outlined in the white paper.

Appeal to authority?
This is a quote about the design.. from the ~~designer~~ inventor.


Actually yes. Data storage hardware has gotten cheaper and bandwidth has improved.

Watch what you say in this sub. I recommend you delete this comment.

“The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  **Those few nodes will be big server farms.** The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.” - [source](
“At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, **it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware..**
..Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.” - [source](

I’ll check it out but there is already a blockchain based web browser, so their patent could be infringing upon prior art

Very interesting point, I’ll look into this when I get some time.

^ This. A lot of people fail to realize that Bitcoin is much deeper than monetary value, the monetary value is a by-product.

OP should fix the title, I believe the correct phrasing was more along the lines of appointing a new moderator rather than actually buying the sub.
