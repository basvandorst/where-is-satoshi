I am working with and Richardxlin on [Motivate](
Motivate is a decentralized platform that empowers users to accomplish their goals using smart contracts and Ethereum. You choose a goal, set up incentives, and the blockchain will keep you on track.

Absolutely. There is still a great need for archiving all kinds of old media, including VHS. I mainly deal with home movies that are starting to degrade after being stored since the 80s/90s.

As long as you store them in a clean environment there should be minimal damage to the tapes or tape quality over time. I think the de-magnetization of the tapes starts to affect the quality after 15-20 years of storage, but as long as they aren't really dirty they be converted. Let me know if you ever get a cheaper way to transfer them or know anyone in the U.S or Texas who can help you out getting them to me.

Ethereum use cases that exists today:
Machine-to-machine autonomous communications to authorize and pay for car sharing (Oaken Innovations).
Decentralized mining pools (SmartPool).
Decentralized cryptocurrency trading (EtherEx, KyberNetwork).
DAOs for transparent charities and donations (Giveth).

Whoops! I meant EtherDelta.

Use cases that exists today is very different than use cases that are fully in production by large companies. There are use cases that exists regardless of if they have been fully implemented.

Now that we have other smart contract blockchainers with potential advancements (like EOS if it works) there is no use case entirely "unique" to Ethereum.
Using Ethereum in blockchain powered charging stations is a use case deployed today. I heard it is expanding to North America soon, but it is in production, live right now:

Congrats! Awesome work.

Ethereum smart contract dev here. I actually did this a few months back:

Worth noting, because the smart contract variables are able to be upgraded I can actually change my status from married to divorced if I ever want to. I love my wife though &lt;3
