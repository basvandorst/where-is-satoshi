Yes maybe but you would not be able to use it. It's like having a kilo of heroin. Great right? But if you are a computer nerd ... it's the same if you throw it down the toilet.

You see ... your arguments are dumb. You are thinking of bitcoin as a legit currency that is not replacable. Your argument "if charities are used by x they should be banned". Same you did with cash.
The problem with those arguments is that you can ban bitcoin and nothing changes but you can't ban charities or cash. There is literally no need for cryptocurrency in global economy so nobody but people who invested in it would miss it. So it is open to ban or extreme regulations.

Ya but ... its so easy to just ban the currency :) I mean yes it could still exist underground but would be much less valuable.

Its easier than you think. There is a reason (terrorism) and there are means to do it.

Why not? Its so easy. Australia used it as a reason to ban bitcoin. There are reports by interpol that the threat is moderate. 
The few examples of terrorist groups showing an interest in cryptocurrencies take place where there is relatively stable internet access. Last year, the Ibn Taymiyya Media Center, an online jihadist media unit based in the Gaza Strip, attempted a social media fundraising campaign by asking for donations in bitcoin. Indonesia has said members of the local ISIS-affiliated militants have conducted transactions with individuals in Syria in bitcoin and through Paypal. A year ago, a Virginia teen was charged for providing material support to ISIS by using Twitter to instruct supporters in how to use bitcoin. All of this experimentation suggests an interest in eventually using the new technology.

are you not worried that btc will get regulated by the state and in worst case made illegal?

The problem is that within 10 years terrorist attacks will quadruple and  will become a logistical nightmare to contain. So I am predicting major changes within EU. 
People somehow do not understand that attacks will become an everyday thing very soon. And cutting off supply will not only happen but will be necessary. So even though something like that willl be hard to pull off you cannot have illegal currency financing you. The argument is the same as with gun debate in US - most deadly attacks there are with legally purchased guns (sandy hook, aurora - i think, vegas) and limiting the gun accesibility would lower the amount of attacks. 
Same shit here. I am expecting either heavy regulations or ban altogether

Its about limiting it not banning the only currency that world runs on. How is that comparable?

Hehe ... people think that it is hard to control the internet. It is not. It is just a political nightmare to do so. Imagine censoring internet in EU. Whoever proposes that commits a political suicide. But when terrorist attacks become an everyday thing changes will be needed and accepted. 
Probably majority of the internet is already heavy controlled - good argument for that is the fact that organised terrorist attacks are so rare. It is so easy to buy guns book a suit and gun people down ... why does it not happen? Simply because antiterrorist organisations have more control over the situation than we know.

Bitcoin is extremely convenient because it is virtual. Cash is hard to transfer without it being detected - there are tons of safe guards in place for money to not be laundered and used to finance terrorists already. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:58:22
It is already well documented that terrorist activities are mainly financed through it. It makes sense.

What if it legally cannot be traded for money? What do you do with it?
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:07:27
Yes you can't stop it but you can make it less "attractive" (cant find the word) to the general public. If it becomes a currency you can only buy illegal goods with, order a sniper or fund terrorists it's legal value plummets. And it's not that hard. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:02:23
This is not agressive. This is just "banning"it. What I am talking about is banning all legal exchanges effectively making BTC not interesting for "regulars". If you can't buy on ebay with it or trade it for money it loses value.
Even though it could still be used in illegal transactions, you cannot ban that but when you have a base that is not millions of users but thousands it is much easier to track it down.
