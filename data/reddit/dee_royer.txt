Why don't you just edit your first post to add reasons to your claim. No one appreciates your post because you aren't sharing any real insight to your claim. While you have time to reply with a victims attitude, you have just as much opportunity to provide evidence to your claim. But... You just....don't.

This whole thread should be on r/AITA. You DO  have to register to convert that BTC to real money YOU CAN USE. Stop acting like BTC is ready for mass adoption. IT WILL BE BUT ISNT YET.

FUD isn't in my mind at all, im confident in BTC reaching $1million. My problem is crypto(as it is NOW) being pushed on people. In the future it will be great, but now, its a damn burden. There are better ways to get people engaged by crypto.

Didnt BTC have insanely high fees when it was at ATH? How can BTC ever be taken seriously for mass adoption?

This is not okay. If someone paid me in a currency I have to jump hurdles to register for, i would spite them and never buy them dinner again.

LOL "hey guys would you mind paying for my food and I pay you in a currency you know nothing about that isnt accepted in most places?" You are an asshole.

Im invested in BTC and have had to register an account about 6 times for different exchanges. Exactly how do you give someone BTC and they are able to move/sell that BTC without signing up with an exchange? Wtf do you mean you can use bitcoin without registering an account? How are they going to get that money into their bank? How are they going to continue using bitcoin? They have to register on an exchange dont they?

I'll be sure to think of this post when it hits $3,500

Their new update has removed decimals. Wtf are they thinking. I cant add decimals. Only whole numbers. Ive had this apps for almost a year and regret not trying other crypto apps.

I noticed decimals have been removed from Blockfolio. Meaning I can only input whole numbers. What are you thinking? Does it matter? I'm already looking for another app.
