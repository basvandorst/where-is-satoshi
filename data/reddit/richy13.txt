There is no real way to estimate this, you could say anything without any activity in the last 2 years are stale? but even that may just be people sitting on them on the long run

Thats the thing, what can you call stale? 6 months of inactivity? a year, 2 years...?

I am looking for this exact thing, I dont really need it to have full wallet functionality but I do want something that allows watcher only crypto currency so I could link up all my wallets for any crypto currency and view their value. Please do say if you find anything!

Is that using a pi zero?

Thats actually a good approach, I have an android phone spare I could use, and they support native encryption which is perfect. I just need to find a wallet that allows offline use and that I can generate keys with, as well as all the wallets for any crypto I may use.
The problem with hardware wallets is what if I want a crypto that it doesn't support? I'm back in the same boat

I'm guessing this is just a sarcastic joke, but my work computer is an i7 mbp which does nothing over night... Worth putting it to use? ;)

Why is this a bitcoin paradise?

I'm not a trader but would love to be part of a comunity that discusses these kind of things!
@_date: 2016-09-20 20:22:28
:DDD Thanks man! Thats awesome!!!
@_date: 2016-09-20 16:47:03
already gone :/
@_date: 2016-10-11 19:39:05
Well, does it matter to have $3000 vs $18000 to you?

Question, what is the appeal of using LocalBitcoins compared to other alternatives? Is it mostly for the ability to find people to trade with in person?
@_date: 2016-10-29 13:39:02
You say this, but in my country at least most (if not all) sellers require you to send them some form of ID if you are a low reputation buyer

Don't, it should be an interest that she develops herself. You can inform her of the benefits but you cant convince her anymore than you could convince her to buy in to gold or a foreign currency
@_date: 2016-07-02 15:08:22
Probably not in the next 5 years, but certainly in the long term

Either this is playing on the pokemon Go hype and he actually stored the key in a toy or something, or the article is bull.
Either way, you cant transfer pokemon, so there is no way someone could steal a pokemon (unless they stole the phone)

a) I doubt it, how can you tell what is "lost" and what is just in cold storage?
b) No, if its gone, its gone. The rest of the bitcoins are worth more
