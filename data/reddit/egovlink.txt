@_date: 2014-01-14 09:54:48
Yeah, I can't say I wasn't motivated by the 200 BTC bounty, because I definitely was.  But I also wanted to experiment with writing a back-end processor to accept Bitcoins, and experiment with writing web code in Python / Pinax.  So it was a "fun" project too.  Especially for me - somewhat removed from day-to-day programming.
As I recall, I had a charge mechanism set up, sort of like domain names.  I had this vision that everyone would want this service, and I didn't want everyone "squatting" on all the good short names as they do with domain names, so I required payment if you wanted to reserve something shorter than 6 letters, or something like that.  And some people paid some millibitcoins to buy shorter ones.  (like, the equivalent of a nickle to 50 cents, at the time, as I recall).  
I had to keep the service running for the duration of what I agreed to, for the very few people who paid, and the very few nickles I made on it!
But I got some experience writing code that interfaced with bitcoind for transaction processing.  If I was smart, I would have then used that knowledge to invent bitpay.... but no....
Bitcoins were going for about a dime, when he first made the bounty offer (so it was a $20 offer that day), and $8.50 when the bounty offer was changed from 200 BTC to 5 BTC (so $1700 to $42.50).  They were about $10 when he paid me.  I still have the 5 BTC, plus the few nickles that people paid me for short names,  so in a weird way, I guess it worked out.  
But it definitely frustrated me at the time.

That is measuring volatility, which I already mentioned that no one questions.
I am trying to measure if you put $100 into something, and want $100 out, can you get it out.  i.e. does it store value?  Hence the name, "Storage of Value".
I appreciate the comment though!

As I said, I conclude that something that literally doesn't store value isn't a good store of value.  Seems pretty reasonable to me.

@_date: 2014-02-16 16:49:49
On the contrary, the press is saying that something either is, or isn't, a good store of value.  
Clearly some things are better than others.  I am trying to measure that, and eliminate volatility as a parameter, which is another issue entirely (and could be mitigated separately).  
Since "store of value" implies some time period of storage, it becomes a question of whether, given a certain time period, t, (or X, as I called it), a particular asset holds its value.  Binary, or so I contend in this analysis.
My biggest objection to Bitcoin regarding store of value is really that it's only been shown to be a good store of value (for periods greater than 2 years) for a very short period (relative to other assets like gold).  Not that it's *not a good store of value*.
I could choose different parameters, like "assuming you need to store value for at least seven months", or "assuming you need to be able to retrieve 90% of the value after 2 months", but that really seemed to be cherry-picking. 
This seemed to be the most natural way to examine historical performance of store of value, helping to answer questions like:  "If you need an asset that you can count on to hold a $100 investment over a 2-year period, which asset has done the best, historically?"
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:08:30
Yeah, all we have is history to look at.  And Krugman, et al, point to the history and say (incorrectly) that it proves that Bitcoin is not a store of value.  This graph seems to indicate that it has better qualities in that area than it's given credit for (historically), although clearly it's a short history and the past is no guarantee of future performance.

I have given a graph of performance of whether various storage methods really stored the value after X days.
You have described something imperfect (that I already demonstrated could *lose 100% of its value every single day*) as a "more perfect" storage facility.  So what you are doing is proposing something (which is purely hypothetical, and does not and cannot exist in the real world) as a straw man.  You are trying to define a tolerance level for leakage, which is fine, but my study was based on a tolerance level of zero leakage.
If I was shopping for a container to store something in, and it leaked, I wouldn't consider that a perfect storage container.  A vat with a hole in the bottom isn't a perfect storage container for liquid.  
There are at least two ways to examine the quality of containers: the rate of leakage and the probability that there will be no leakage when I check back after the storage period.  Those are two entirely different measures.
You are so hung up on the former, that you refuse to admit that the latter has any validity.  Personally, I see value in both, but I set out to measure the latter.
Until you can open your mind that there is validity in the latter, we'll have to agree to disagree.
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:59:43
The question that I have been trying to address is whether Bitcoin is a good store of value by examining historical information.  You cite two alternatives that have no historical data, but are probability-based.  But if I created a likely "history" or projection, based on these two scenarios, then they would appear on this graph as two lines very near the bottom of the graph that I created, near or at the 0% X-axis. In other words, history would show that neither is a good store of value, as you would not have been able to get your value out of either, with any reasonable likelihood.
Both of these examples require cash payments on an ongoing basis, which is really not what a "store of value" is looking at.  So I have to adjust them to run a model.  For example, in the lottery's case, perhaps set aside $10K, and use $10 per day to gamble.  So the account would erode by $10 per day, until the lottery hits. 
The lottery would line would start at point (1,0.1), meaning that after one day, there's a 0.1% chance that the scheme "stored value".  It would climb as high as 9.52% (i.e. small) at day 100, so really the maximum you would ever see your entire value is less than 10% of the time with 100 day intervals in this investment.  This is a terrible store of value.
The second has potentially worse properties, as you are guaranteed to never see your value again if you invest in that scheme.  There's a lack of data in your proposal, but if the limit of your investment is 1 cent per day, you are entirely wiped out - to zero - every single day.  Obviously this could be considered a horrible store of value.   
In any case, no matter the size of investment, you are guaranteed to never see the full value of your investment ever, whether you store it there for a day or a thousand years.  And in a thousand years, investments of $10 or less would be wiped out in their entirety (assuming the load is also inflation adjusted).
**TL; DR:  Both hypothetical, unavailable investment schemes are bad examples when examining the property ability to store and retain 100% of their value.**
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:03:06
Thanks!  I'm very interested in any criticisms of my methodology.
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:17:35
The reason *I* think it's useful is because if I put money into a value storage vehicle, I want to know the probability that it'll do what it is *defined by its name to do*, which is to store value, not gradually erode.
Clearly you (and others) accept and expect a level of erosion, despite the name "store of value", which is the polar opposite of "leaky storage container".  It either stores value or it doesn't.
I can produce the same style graphs (using all the same data) at a leakage tolerance level, to see what it looks like.  But then the question comes up - "What daily level of leakage is tolerable?"  I have to pick a number.  My tolerance was 0%, because of the name.  
What do you think a reasonable answer to that would be?  Perhaps the average amount of leakage that the dollar has shown over the last 100 years?  That was 3.37% inflation per month, or about .11% per day.  You put in $1000, and watch 11 cents disappear every day (at the beginning, declining as the money erodes away).
It's an easy change to the programming.  I just need to pick a value of tolerance.
                if sell &gt;= buy:
                    success += 1
changes to: 
                if sell &gt;= buy - buy*(tolerance**days):
                    success += 1
.... or something like that.

I thought you might get a kick out of this.
Back in 2011, there was [a bounty of 200 BTC to build this service.](    I decided to do it as a weekend project, and just as I was releasing it, the person who posted the bounty changed it to 5 BTC.
[I released it a few days later.]( with some bugs during the Beta test, but basically working fine.  (All the bugs were apparently in the "feature" creep:  extra code that I had written to allow Forum users to be able to claim their Forum ID, which was a bit tricky.)
People pointed out the same problem - that I could swap out their address for my own.
Very few people used it.  People would sign up, but there were almost zero lookups.
So I took it down.  Bottom line, my first Bitcoin transaction was performing work expecting 200 BTC and only getting paid 5 BTC.

Bitcoin does not constantly increase in price.   But I would contend that an asset which never decreases in price 100% of the time is the perfect store of value.  At least according to the [wikipedia definition](  


I considered doing this, but it seemed to be really too aggressive, since **the several year history of the dollar is the flat line along the bottom of the chart**.  That's right, 0% of the time, in the past several years, has month-over-month inflation been negative.  So if you want me to label the X axis as "Dollar, last several years", I could do that.


I was looking for a daily measurement of the strength of the dollar, since we are looking at the daily measurements of the strength of Bitcoin.  If you have another metric, please let me know.
Thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:17:31
Thanks for the feedback.   
On the flip side, it also doesn't measure whether it's 100% or 1000%.  That measure is really "volatility".  
This is a measure of Store of Value - the binary question of whether value was retained.
But you have a good point.  It's just not what I set out to measure.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:06:16
Volatility isn't a true measure of ability to store value.  A simple example is an investment that is guaranteed to always doubles in value every day. 
It's extremely volatile, but clearly stores the value that you put in it, based on the wikipedia definition.
That is why I didn't measure volatility.  Volatility is a completely separate issue.  I don't dispute that Bitcoin's volatility is an issue, but that can me mitigated separately if you are looking for a store of value.

Today I received a call from a reporter at the local newspaper (Cincinnati Enquirer).  Real nice guy, said he saw the [article](  and [press release](  (that we are integrating Bitcoin Payments into our Software suite for local governments), but assumed it was an April Fool’s joke, so he didn’t follow up sooner.
He started with “Why would a Local Government want to accept Bitcoins?”  We had a long conversation (maybe an hour), and he seemed to really catch on.  I sent him some links with lots more information.  He sounds like a very inquisitive guy who is able to ask the tough questions (as you’d expect from a good reporter), but he also seemed very open-minded, and wanting to learn.
I’ll post the article when it hits the web.
One analogy that I tried out on him, I’d like opinions on:

We'd love to expand internationally -  that is, take orders from customers that want our services internationally :) , although I expect that our outbound marketing focus will remain primarily on the US.
I'm a big fan of Bitcoin, and so I'm trying to do my part to spread the good news.  I think if every Bitcoin holder does their little part, wherever they can, it'll catch on in a big way.
Our parent business (Electronic Commerce Link) has been around since 1996, and has a number of E-Commerce related web applications and customers.  In fact, we had some banking solutions over the years, and so we'll likely approach some of our contacts in that area (perhaps helping them set up local Bitcoin exchanges, ATMs, or other services that can get people access to Bitcoins, make them familiar with Bitcoins, etc.).
In short, we don't know where this is all going, but we thought that the E-Gov payments place was an area that we could make an immediate impact.

[His exact quote (at 40:39) was](


I think he is correct - that the proof of work function will change.  I think his timing is off, though.
This doesn't necessarily mean that we change from SHA256 to scrypt or that ASICs will become worthless.  It doesn't mean that we will go to Proof of Stake or some other mechanism.  It means that the FUNCTION will change.
Right now, the function that locks blocks is a digital hash of the block being less than a certain difficulty.  This function solves several major challenges:  Protection against double spend, equitable distribution of coins, and giving people incentive to perform security work for the network.
It does NOT address several other challenges:  minimizing the amount of information required to validate transaction (minimal block chain), providing incentive for nodes on the network (non-miners), and maximizing the amount of dollars required to perform a 51% attack (although it does a pretty good job at this, it's actually pushing CPUs and GPUs out of the business of securing the network, which is a bad thing.)
The "function" can change without changing the total premise of Bitcoin.  The Proof of Work function can incorporate all of these things in there, such that the Proof of Work is optimization challenge that incorporates all of the variables mentioned above:  


- the amount of data necessary to validate spending (minimize this)    
- the amount of data necessary to evolve the previous spending validation data to the new one (minimize this)     
- the amount of dollars required to buy hardware equivalent to the current mining hardware (maximize this)    
- the amount of full nodes (maximize this, perhaps through micro payments to full nodes?)
Since we are trying to maximize the cost to attack the network, encouraging CPU mining (through some co-existence algorithm) would be advisable.  With ASICs out there, we want to reward that investment, not throw it away.
See my forthcoming white paper (?) for details.  :)

**TL;DR:  Bitcoin goes at silent auction for $390.  Probably wouldn't have been bid on, but for our table!**
[I mentioned earlier in the week]( that me and a friend donated a Bitcoin for an auction to raise money for [CancerFree Kids]( a charity in Cincinnati that funds research to eliminate Cancer in children.
To everyone who asks daily, "Am I too late to the party?", here's one data point.  At an event where wallets were open, for a good cause, with hundreds of generous donors bidding thousands of dollars for items, there was a virtual "pile of money" sitting there, waiting to be bid on.  One Bitcoin.  Opening Bid = $250.
Many items went for over face value.  A frickin' Justin Beeber picture went for over a hundred bucks.  So surely, with a crowd full of upper-middle class folks in [Money Magazine's 7th most livable city]( the affluent Cincinnati suburb called [Mason, Ohio]( a Bitcoin would be a known commodity, and would go for well over face value.  Right?  The top item went for $6300, so we're not talking about a stingy crowd here.
It was a silent auction, so people wandered by, and I got to listen to the reactions.  Most people passed it by without comment, as they bid on massage packages and wine baskets.
I overheard one person answering questions about Bitcoin.  Someone asked "what is it?" and he said "oh, it's really volatile.  Probably want to stay away from that."
(I'm thinking, this is a no-brainer.  $250 for something that you can take home and sell TONIGHT for $420.)
I opened the bidding at $250.  I think all of the bids on the Bitcoin were from people at my table.  And it went for $390.
So, to answer your question - are you too late?  If 500 generous people don't understand the value, and it's a bidding war between the few people at our table, no, you aren't too late.  Not even close!
**Special thanks go to the Coinbase team - and company, for making sure my paper wallet was loaded up in time.**  Some technical difficulties led to a little bit of a last minute panic, but as always, those guys are first class in a pinch.

We'll definitely publicize when the first municipality implements.  Although local governments tend to be conservative by nature, we have some very forward-looking, progressive customers.  So, we'll see!
The other interesting dynamic is that although municipalities don't compete like businesses do, there's definitely a drive to be "serving the citizens at least as well as the neighboring city or suburb". So I expect we'll see the "bitcoin as a competitive advantage" slogan play out there as well!
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:57:43
Each municipality decides what payment options they accept.  We're hoping that a lot opt for Bitcoin, but it's their choice.  
And frankly, we're hoping that by being first to the game, showing our support for Bitcoin, and demonstrating a leadership position here, that  that progressive municipalities who recognize the potential of Bitcoin will contact us.  
Bitcoin is a competitive advantage for us.

Neon's Unplugged
208 E. 12th Street, Cincinnati, OH (map)
Last week's discussion was great. We reached our goal of 10 participants! Let's see if we can beat this record!
In order to better accommodate to those new to bitcoin, we are going to try and dedicate the first 45 minutes of our next discussion to more basic topics if newcomers are present. We'll have a break after about 45 minutes to allow those who want to continue with more technical topics an opportunity do so, (either in a smaller group or one on one discussions if desired) and to give those who wish head out an opportunity to leave without interrupting things.
We are going to have our next get together on the second floor of neon's again. It has been a much quieter area of the bar on Thursday nights and has a nice area with multiple couches and comfortable chairs facing each other. Please come and join us, and bring a friend! There is no need to RSVP or join the group on this website if that is too much commitment or too public for you, just feel free to show up if you like!

Should I wait for the edits to stop?  ;)
1. We are only in the US currently, but operate primarily on the web.  So nothing really precludes us from operating in other countries; just haven't done it yet.
2. We have some contacts with other software companies, including competitors.  But we won't be encouraging our competitors to implement this feature, as I think **Bitcoin is a competitive advantage.** (You can quote me on that.  I want to be the first vendor to have said that!)    
But integrating Bitcoin payments into a shopping cart experience really isn't all that difficult now that payment processors are there to do a lot of the heavy lifting (accept payment and currency conversion).
3.  Altcoins:  Since we rely on payment processors, this isn't really an alternative at this time.  For example, BitPay is (as far as I know) only transacting in Bitcoins, not, say, Litecoins for example.

Hey, do you guys have any venture funding or other corporate funding that would lend credibility to your service (obviously you've put a lot of work into doing things right, but I am trying to compare pros and cons to people storing Bitcoins here vs. say Coinbase, who is reasonably well funded).
Also, what are the risks that people should know about, when weighing your wallet services vs. others?  Do you have 90% in cold storage?  Are you just two guys who know your private key, and if you both get hit by a truck, are the users out of luck?

~~I don't think it'd be wise to publish our customer list online (especially if it encouraged pestering - we don't want to aggravate our customers!), but~~ [Edit, well... there's a partial list.  oh well]  I can tell you that we have these types of customers, in over 30 states:  Villages, Towns, Townships, Cities, Counties.  Many are suburbs of big cities, but not typically the big cities themselves.  Think about the city of Chicago (not a customer), and look at the hundreds of towns, villages, and cities that surround it (some are customers).
Bitcoin advocates such as yourself may wish to contact *their own* municipality, and encourage the use of Bitcoin.  If your local city sells pool passes, or rents shelters for parties, or has events, or charges for permits, tell them about bitcoin, and if you are so inclined, direct them to our press release!

As most of you probably already know, we're trying to get a municipality to accept Bitcoin, and are ready to help with the implementation.   
The advantages are pretty clear - little risk (if you use Bitpay or Coinbase to convert to local currency immediately), better citizen service (more options), lower fees vs. credit cards.
I can't wait to announce the first municipality accepting Bitcoins for parking tickets, utility bills, parks reservations, pool passes, classes and events, permits, etc.
If you happen to have influence with a local municipality that's interested, have them give us a call:      513-591-7362

Glad you're excited about it!  Let me know if I can answer any questions about it!

The more expensive it is to gain a significant portion of the network (i.e. 51%), the stronger Bitcoin is.  So to maximize strength of the network, you would want maximum compute power devoted to protecting the network, while rewarding / encouraging "expensive" compute power. That's why i said that pushing people OUT of mining is bad for bitcoin.
That's my logic anyway.  As someone else pointed out, renting a botnet for an hour or two, to achieve 51% might be far less expensive than trying to control an ASIC net of the same capacity.

No, but the discount (or price advantage) is really in the fees.  They can save a ton on credit card processing fees.  And Municipalities are accountable for the money they spend, so this is definitely an issue.
Municipalities look for ways to best serve their citizens, and if citizens are asking for it, most will look into it.  So the more Bitcoin fans request it of their local governments, the more likely they are to offer Bitcoin payments as an option.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:24:08
We are doing business with local governments, and they tend to be pretty responsive to the people that they serve.  This isn't as bureaucratic as working with the federal government.  If a municipality hears from a few citizens that the citizens would like to have a Bitcoin payment option, then they may contact us about it.
We recognize that we have little to gain by talking to the municipalities and asking them to take Bitcoin.  Until there is demand, they likely won't be interested.  
But the passionate Bitcoin enthusiasts can actually affect change which can be beneficial to Bitcoin and to us.

I expect that every customer (municipality) will opt for full and immediate conversion to US Dollars.

Hey Canton Becker!  I was just talking about your site earlier today.  A friend and I have donated a Bitcoin to a charity auction, and we used your site to print the paper wallet.  It looks so classy!

Well, if you consider that one objective is to maximize the cost of machines securing the network (so as to make a 51% attack more and more difficult), the last thing you'd want to do is to obsolete the ASICs.
So, one way to implement a revised function, such that the current ASICs could continue to compete, is to have two separate mechanisms that can "win" a block.  One being SHA based (which would work well with the current ASICs), and one being something that ASICs aren't so good at (so CPUs and GPUs can join in).  And they compete against each other.

There are many bitcoin presentations on Slideshare, but I think this is one of the better ones.
I think this is for Mac, so you may have difficulty editing it.  I made screen captures of all of the pages, and pasted them into Powerpoint, so that I could add and remove slides.  If you want that, send me your email address in a PM and I'll email you the powerpoint.  
NOTE, you won't be able to edit the contents of a particular slide very easily, because they are "pictures" pasted into Powerpoint.  But you can rearrange and delete and add slides (and cover stuff up and annotate).

I appreciate that!  I discovered Canton Becker's [bitcoinpaperwallet site]( just in time to create this.  I was planning on just using bitaddress.org, as I have used so many times in the past, but these paper wallets turned out AWESOME, especially when printed on thicker glossy photo paper.
Bitcoinpaperwallet isn't your site, by any chance, is it?  If so, well done!

We won't be tracking the "what might have been" number.  As you can imagine, most municipalities are conservative in nature, and are accountable to their citizens.  So there's safety in receiving US Dollars, as opposed to an alternative currency which is certainly early in its implementation, and can be considered experimental and high risk.
One of our large payments customers is in the heart of Silicon Valley, so I'm expecting them to be one of the first to move forward with Bitcoin.  I suspect if they hear the offering from us, and hear the requests from a few citizens, then they'll look into it.  
After we have some representative numbers, I'll be sure to report back.   I'm a regular contributor to even though I just created the user today.  (Can't have my boss knowing my usual reddit ID, eh?)

OP here.  We decided to integrate Bitcoin payments into our E-Gov Suite of products, so that citizens can pay for municipal services with Bitcoin.
This means that our customers - cities, towns, and villages across the US - will be able to accept Bitcoins for payments of services like permits, utilities, class or event registration, shelter reservations, or even parking tickets.
We just use our favorite **Bit**coin **Pay**ment processor to handle the transaction and the conversion to Dollars.
Thought you guys would want to know.  I think that government entities accepting Bitcoin will continue the momentum for Bitcoin!
I bet you can't wait to pay a parking ticket with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-10-16 21:44:37
Yeah, I'm not sure what to expect there, but I have some ideas.
I think the idea is to do a Satoshi Square (where you can buy and sell bitcoins), but there are a few members who have other goods, denominated in Bitcoins - some CD's (music), some Bitcoin stocks, who knows what.
I will be happy if our transaction count exceeds zero!  But who knows, I may be pleasantly surprised.

I am [presenting]( May 10th, and the topic is "Should Your Business Use Bitcoins?"
One of my slides is straight out of a Reddit discussion:


You can accept payment today with Bitpay, and convert IMMEDIATELY to dollars or 10 other currencies, all or part of the payment. There's little risk to the vendor, and only up-side: 
1.	You get a cash deposit in the currency of your choice immediately.    
2.	You have zero chance of charge-backs.    
3.	You provide another payment option for your customers. Customer service!    
4.	You can offer a discount because there are lower fees and less likelihood of fraud as compared to credit cards.    
5.	You get IMMEDIATE press for offering to accept Bitcoin.    
6.	The Bitcoin community actually is supporting early vendors!    
7.	You have a competitive advantage as a "Market Leader" among your peers.    
My question is Why not?

**How much will one Bitcoin go for in an auction Thursday Night?**
I am attending an auction for [CancerFree Kids]( Thursday night, and decided it'd be cool to donate One Bitcoin to be auctioned off.
I thought I'd share with you [the display]( in case anyone else decides to do something similar.  My plan is to have the auction winner pick up an envelope with a paper wallet in it, as well as some instructions, included below.
Feedback is welcome!  It's not too late for me to change the display or the contents of the instructions.  And if you want to donate to this great organization fighting Pediatric Cancer, all tips sent to me in this thread (or money sent to my address, 1GZ7GYqXQZ97HFrF513mzJYs93o9zNtUtW) will be **donated to CancerFree Kids**, and I'll include a note with the display mentioning that additional donations for CancerFree Kids were anonymously donated by the Bitcoin Community on Reddit.         
^^FYI, ^^I'm ^^Jerry ^^Felix, ^^from ^^E-Gov ^^Link.
Here are the instructions.  Feedback Welcome!






For the first time in history, you can send value directly to nearly anyone in the world, nearly instantly, and nearly free.  Bitcoin enables that.  Many industry experts predict that digital currencies will continue to gain momentum to the point where in the coming years, they will be a part of our everyday lives.


















If, as some people believe, this one Bitcoin becomes extremely valuable, you will want to take certain precautions.  First, protect this Paper Wallet from moisture.  Your Paper Wallet is printed by an inkjet printer, and will likely be damaged by moisture, rendering your Bitcoin useless and unrecoverable.  Consider putting it in plastic.

Our parent company (Electronic Commerce Link) has been involved with Credit Unions since the 90's (implementing Home Banking, e-Statements, Y2K - remember that?, and tons of other Credit Union projects).
I sent out some bitcion information to a few of our long time customers.  They all seem curious, but are taking a wait-and-see attitude.

I'm "Felix", the guy from the article that said that.  It's hard to use all the right words when the reporter starts asking you questions.
But in this case, looking up the definition of absorb, I feel like it captures the process pretty well:


Clearly you are not making the cost disappear, any more than China would be making invaders disappear.  You are spreading it among all of the other costs, which, yes, are paid for by taxpayers.

Thanks for the bitcents. 
Thanks, too, for the Protip, but I think you have it backwards.  You can't login *without* a username.
I know you want to minimize the perception of any possible security issues, but having a list of usernames does open up more attack surface:  an attack surface greater than zero, no matter how trivial.  It's scarily naive that you wouldn't recognize that, especially with all the mention of security features.  Or maybe you agree but think it's trivial, which would make a joke reply inappropriate.  Maybe more appropriate would be: "Hey thanks, we [hadn't] thought of that, but decided the rest of the security features trivialize this very slightly increased risk."
Having a list of username simplifies many possible attacks, including phishing attempts, social engineering attempts, and attacks using third party servers/services - not just brute force attacks.  This happened on services in the past, where users' known email addresses were targeted based on their common username and email address posted elsewhere.  
Example, MtGox user file was leaked in 2011.  Anyone username appearing in that file also has an email address that is known.  That means that someone can phish directly to the email address on file for that username, and pretend to be Inputs.io.  And it could fool someone because "oh, I just signed up with these guys, and no one else would know that, but them."  This attack has worked in the past.  
If, today, all of your new users got an official looking email saying "Thanks for signing up with Inputs.io yesterday.  We hope you enjoy our new service.  Click here to complete the registration and to validate your most common IP address.", they could be phished for a password and pin and guided through providing all necessary login information for use at a later date by the attacker.  Not saying it would definitively work, but I am saying *it* **has worked** *in the past*.  It relies on users lowering their guard because the thief establishes trust by providing information that appears to have been hard to obtain by illegitimate parties.  It's one of the common techniques of magicians, thieves, and even aggressive sales organizations.  (Domain name renewal scams were done this way for years.)
It didn't stop me from posting a user name to try your service with bitcents, but for any major use, I'll be using a different account that I didn't post here.
**TL;DR: Username lists have proven to increase attack surface.**
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:38:02
Yes, that's a definitely a partial list.  I don't encourage pestering them, though!      
($%@ internet.. yer gonna get me fired!)
What would help is if you contacted your own municipality, that you are a citizen of (since they answer to you) and encouraged them to accept Bitcoin.  Feel free to direct them to us!  
@_date: 2013-04-06 02:44:56
Yes, that probably wasn't the best way to word the press release, but generally, you got it.
