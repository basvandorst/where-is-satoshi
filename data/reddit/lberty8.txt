My view of Sqig when I was debating him was that his Economic understanding seemed quite limited and he couldn't make clear what he meant. When he made himself clear the arguments were very poor to say the least. I even felt like I was getting trolled.
For instance he would say that Bitcoin is a zero-sum game and I would give him an example of using Bitcoin with added value so the concept of zero-sum wouldn't apply. I would also give him the definition of zero-sum. His counterargument would be that I don't know what zero-sum means when I even gave him the definition. He would say it's a zero-sum game because Fractional Reserve Banking isn't possible with Bitcoin. I would give him an example of fractional reserve banking with bitcoin and an online real life example. He would argue it's not fractional reserve banking when I clearly showed him the evidence.
Maybe he was out of shape but my experience is that he's a very limited thinker with poor arguments and no ability to adapt to obvious proof.

Peter Schiff contradicts himself. First he said Bitcoin is a bubble because people hold on to them. And when people don't hold on to them he says it's also a bad thing because they're dumped on the market.
The fact is Bitcoin's network is expanding, first it were the consumers who bought them, now businesses are accepting them. It's actually a healthy thing now the Bitcoin economy is growing. Next there will be employees accepting Bitcoin as wages and the circle is made.
Peter Schiff is biased with regards to bitcoin, he's heavily invested in Gold.

Zero-sum means that the total value gained is 0. For me and many other people there is value in using Bitcoin. For example when I'm going out with friends having a drink and we want to settle the bill it's really convenient to just transfer the amount with Bitcoin using our mobile phone.
I realise it's not for everybody and clearly not for you, but some people receive value buy it.

You don't know how fractional reserver banking works.
Banks can loan out the money and credit the account of the savers/investors. The money isn't really there for the savers and it's loaned out, but to the savers it looks like the money is there. That's how money is created.
It's like Mt. Gox is loaning out all the Bitcoins that are deposited except for 20% and depositors still think that the Bitcoins are there.

Like I explained to you, in Fractional Reserve Banking money is created by the act of expanding the balance sheet. Money is borrowed to the lenders but to the savers it looks like the money is still there within the Bank.
It also works that way within our current fiat system, if everybody would get their dollars (or Euros where I'm from) from the bank at the same time the Bank would run out of money because the money isn't there. Not if everyone would demand their deposits at the same time.

You clearly don't understand the concept of zero sum. Zero sum means that the total added value in a group is zero or less. If Bitcoin gives you convenience or efficiency and clearly it does give that to at least some people some of the time, that's added value. The value added is convenience or time saved through efficiency.
Money creation by governments is a good example of a zero-sum game. Value gained by the recipient of newly created money is offset by the loss of value of the other money in existence. I'm not arguing the fact that fiat gives us value, it clearly does give us value, but moneyprinting is a zero-sum game.

Some businesses have another purpose for Bitcoin, but most of them will exchange them for traditional money. That's why the market cap is only about $11 billion at the moment.

How can you call it zero-sum if it clearly has utility value to it? At least to some people as you can see people are using it. I'm using it within my social circle to make transactions. So there is a demand which gives it value.
The fact they're scarce is also a positive, because it gives them value. I don't see how they're difficult to obtain. At least in my country I can just buy them with my debit card from my bank account.
I agree, Bitcoin has to overcome challenges and it will be a pain when governments would fight it, but I see Bitcoin as a network that's slowly growing and gaining territory.

There have been periods of deflation in history where the economy was thriving. I'm talking about healthy kind of deflation, not the curing type of deflation after an inflationary boom.
Here is exactly what I think about inflation. Don't accept it from me. Listen to the pro, Peter Schiff:

That's possible with Bitcoin too. If governments won't prevent it with laws there is no reason why there won't be a bank where you can deposit your Bitcoins. The Bank can keep a fraction of your money and lend the rest to businesses to invest in. You could receive interest on your money. It's called fractional reserve banking and it's quite possible with Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is very volatile so it won't make much sense to borrow Bitcoins but it's possible to take out a dollarloan and convert it to Bitcoin as far as needed. The fact of the matter is that the leverage in the economy that is created by fractional reserve banking can be done in one currency and trade can be done in multiple currencies.

You don't know how fractional reserve banking works.
A group of people put 1000 BTC in a Bank. The bank can for example give out loans for 800 BTC, because it needs to keep 200 BTC in reserves. The bank knows that not everybody will take out their Bitcoin at the same time.
Somebody takes out a loan and buys a house. Eventually these Bitcoin will be put in another Bank. To keep things simple let's say the whole 800 BTC is deposited in another bank which will loan out 640 BTC and keep 160 BTC in reserves.
This process continues on and on. The same amount of Bitcoin circulate, it's still 1000 BTC, this is called the M1 money supply. The M2 money supply is 5 times higher in this example and is 5000 BTC.

@_date: 2014-01-14 20:09:16
Maybe this is an easier example. If you would borrow $100 to me, we in fact expand the money supply, just like in FRB.
I owe you $100, so you would still count that $100 on your balance sheet as money. In the mean time I spend the $100 in the economy so it's also circulating there. We've expanded the money supply.
It works that way with Dollars / Euro's / Bitcoin or even bananas if we would accept them as a medium of exchange.

Let me point out a few flaws in your arguments.


False, Bitcoin has value because Bitcoins have utility value as a medium of exchange, not just because people believe in them. People believe in them because people (or at least people who haven't been brainwashed by popular economic doctrine) are smart enough to recognize this value. Even if you say they're not practicle, to a lot of people they're very practical. The usabilty gives them demand which in combination with their limited supply gives them value.


False. It's true that Bitcoin other then the usability value as a medium of exchange doesn't have another utility. BUT, the risk involved with Bitcoin = (the value of a bitcoin x the chance that this will happen). You totally ignore the last part of the equation so your theory about the risk is very flawed. You'll probably debate the chance that this will happen is quite large, but it's not, because there is a lot of demand for Bitcoin because of the usability value.


In a casino the house always wins. In a casino you are sure that in the long term you're  better of not playing at all. Bitcoin is not a zero-sum game like in a casino (financially speaking, because a casino can be a lot of fun). In a casino it is a zero-sum game, but with a Bitcoin transaction that's not true, because at least in some situations Bitcoin can facilitate trade in a very good way. Because it's facilitating trade and making it easier it's adding value.

Answer this question my friend and you'll be rich. Nobody knows for sure. Nor pro-bitcoiners and neither con-bitcoiners. There are a few things growing exponentionally though, the value, adoption rate, people at exchanges etc. There is still a whole lot upside potential so even if the value of Bitcoin is ahead of the curve right now it isn't a problem.
And yes people are actually paying things with bitcoin. Bitpay offers statistics, these numbers are also growing exponentially.
You'll also need to remember the network effect. If 10% of the people use Bitcoin only 1% can be transacted in Bitcoin. If 20% of the people use Bitcoin this number quadruples.


I'm not worried about this, because there is still exponential growth in the usage of Bitcoin. I'm also a believer that what happened in Cyprus it will happen in many more countries, this will speed up Bitcoin adoption.
I guess you need to be some kind of visionary to see where this Bitcoin economy is heading, but it's showing exponential growth though, in all aspects.

They included the number of black Friday.  Even if you detract black Friday it still shows exponential growth. If you fail to see exponential growth, sorry I suspect I'm talking to somebody biased and I've been waisting my time.
Did I say Bitcoins are worthless? The market cap is only about 8 billion assuming all coins mined are in circulation. That's worth something, but is still a small number with a lot of upside potential. If nobody would use Bitcoins, yes they're worthless, like gold would be worth a lot less if it wasn't used as a store of value. But people recognize the utility value in Bitcoin as it clearly shows in the exponential growth in its adoption, which you fail to see due to your biased mind.

The first point I'd like to make is that the deflationary nature of Bitcoin is why so many people love it. You want to own stuff that's scarce so you'll know it will retain its value. You don't want powerhungry governments to control a printing press.
Second of all. I personally don't buy any of the Keynesian "deflation is bad for the economy" stuff. I think deflation has a bad rep because the deflation we know of is the inevitable deflationary crisis after too much easy money by governments and central banks. History shows examples of balanced deflationary economies. Who doesn't want his money to keep its value? It makes sense to me that stuff becomes cheaper over time because businesses and people become more efficiënt. Maybe some people like us to believe inflation is good because they have a vested interest, maybe they really believe devaluing something you own is good for you. Who knows?

Because bitcoin are superior for making payments more and more people are starting to use them. When a business decides to accept a payment method with for instance Bitpay, that's how the infrastructure is built. You can't just upload your QR-code to your website. You need to integrate it into your website and you need to know what to do with your financial administration. This takes time for people to get familiar with.
If you follow your logic something can't be succesfull if it isn't a success instantly, but this is not true. The value of money is derived by the habits of people using it. People need to change their ways and their habits. This takes time, but it shows more and more people are converting to Bitcoin.

It takes about 17 thousand of these machines to reproduce the current hashing power. That's about 17000 x .35 kW = 5950 kW.

The protocol isn't reliant, only the short term value. The protocol isn't affected at all and in the long run the value of Bitcoin isn't either. Bitcoin is like a virus that can't be stopped.


The volatility isn't a product of the inflation rate. It's a product of the small market cap. As Bitcoin's acceptance widens so will the volatility decrease.
