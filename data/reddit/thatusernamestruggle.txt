I’m currently studying for my Econ finals. I wanted to thank you for responding to OP and saving me from wasting time by having to do it myself.

Bitcoin has too many basic fundamental problems to become the “internet of money.” Number one being that it is unregulated. Monetary policy is absolutely crucial to our economic well being. Without a centralized banking system all lending and credit markets will collapse, bringing the economy to a complete stop and sparking the worlds most serious depression. 
The banking system is extremely complex and it has profound effects on the world we live in. Saying we need to get rid of centralized banking and let Bitcoin run its course is like saying we should eliminate all adults and let children under the age of 5 rule the world. We need a powerful institution run by people who have spent their lives studying Economics to make the best possible decisions on monetary policy just like 5 year olds need adults to tell them to not stick scissors in an electrical outlet.

I get where you are coming from, but I don’t know that limiting power would be the right move. 
The reason I say this is because the power which the Fed has is very necessary. The Fed has a set of tools which allows it to adjust features of the economy such as the interest rate and the money supply. By using these tools, the Fed can keep inflation in check and at a healthy level (about 3% inflation per year is actually very good for the economy). I’d go into way more detail about exactly how the central banking system works (you should look into it if you are unfamiliar because it’s actually extremely fascinating), but I’ve got both an Econometrics and Finance final tomorrow so I should be spending my time studying lol.
Now, the Fed is a human institution, meaning human error is unavoidable. We also can’t perfectly fit economic models and economic theory to real life. But what we can do is gather extremely intelligent Economists and have them do their best to apply sound theory to our real world situation. Like I said, it might not be absolutely perfect, but it is better than the alternative chaos. As humans, we’re constantly pushing forward and progressing as a race in all aspects of life; this goes for economics as well. Actually, I’d like to add an exception to my last statement; mumble rap isn’t helping rap progress, it’s just shitting all over the genre.

This is not proper valuation. You can not properly “value” bitcoin. It does not share the same qualities that equities do. This is trend recognization.

Well, to take the “piss” out of your comment, I don’t trade stocks, I invest. What this means is that I don’t rely heavily on charts and trends to develop trading strategies. Instead, I rely on fundamental qualities, financial statement analysis, and more complex/sound valuation methods to find opportunities of value for long-run investments. 
Edit: Thought you said equities, not commodities. I don’t really focus on commodity trading as I invest in equities for the reason stated above.
