Nonsense, you sound like an idiotic moron trying to use 'cultural appropriation'. If you were really from an Asian country you would know that imitation is a form of flattery and they don't subscribe to this nonsense that you see in the west. Go beg for bitcoin elsewhere you lech.

That's why I bailed last cycle. Although I regret not holding for the last several years profit wise, at least the bitcoin madness is over and I can focus on actually living rather than obsessing.

Or worse, sell something with bitcoin,  then by the time the transaction clears, bitcoin has lost 15% of its value. Who in their right mind would risk such loses?

That's stupid if you believe what is said on a reddit sub has any real world impact on the value of bitcoin. Most people which actually influence the price of bitcoin have better things to do than spend time here being influenced by strangers.

Can't help but think they'll dismiss those emails or SMS as spam, hell, I get bitcoin funds scam emails which go straight into my spam folder.

The original adopters got into bitcoin because it wasn't controlled by any financial institutions or government bodies, it cuts out the bank middleman in transactions.
Most of the people adopting it currently, the majority in this subforum are in because they saw a chance to make profits on speculation, causing the bubbles, the crashes and then then the jaded stagnation which follows.
The irony of bitcoin is it's the stability of bitcoin which allows it to be adopted for its intended purpose as a currency and drives the demand and value to the point where speculators are attracted, who cause it to lose its stability and become useless as currency.

I call it the bitcoin madness. 
You obsess about bitcoin and consumes your life, causing you neglect your worthwhile hobbies and waste away friendships due to neglect ( or driving them away from your insufferable bitcoin profits bragging ).
I think it's super unhealthy for someone to obsess about the value of their money several or more times a day.
