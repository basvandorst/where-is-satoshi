The domain is supposed to be controlled by the masternode consensus, but one individual must have access to the domain to implement those changes. If that individual got compromised, then they would be able to do anything with the domain - even sell it to the highest bidder (who could copy the current site and replace it with DASH builds with malware).

I'm not sure you understand. You were saying that dash.org domain was owned by the dash masternode conglomerate, but instead it it truly private (as controlled by an individual who is not part of a legally registered business).

Just realised that you wrote P2SH. Litecoins and Dogecoin also be P2SH. Multi dig addresses are practically unheard of in Litecoins yet, therefore the likelyhood that some one does do this is very low. Also I'm pretty sure P2SH function checks if the address is valid or not.
Anyone can change and push an update if they are concerned about this issue. Also by the way, when the second version of Litecoin was released (forked from Github) - the BIPs didn't even exist. And instead ever since, everything has been checks and manually written in.

The Litecoin devs are getting paid for their work. And Litecoin is not a 'hobby project', that is an objective opinion. Others may disagree.
Sure, there are risks related to implementation of SegWit. However Litecoin's implementation of Segregated Witness is the same as that of Bitcoin Cores'. AFAIK there haven't been any tweaked parameters for SegWit, apart from that of the BIP9 activation dates and percentages (which is exactly the same from Bitcoin Testnet).

The app internally does support it, but default addresses are not bech32. This is since some wallets still don't have support to sending to bech32 addresses, so what'd happen is some people might not be able to receive coins. Until bech32 support increased, P2SH-P2WPKH will be the default for most wallets.

I am one of a bunch of people with access to the Litecoin.com source - four people have contributed to the repo. I believe the server periodically updates itself to run whatever's on the repo, so there's no need for anyone to worry about access to the server.
The website itself isn't just a bunch of html, css and js; it's not static - it's more of a complex solution where there is a lot of internal management tools which help administrate the app; so things like translation, blogging etc. is written into the site's server. It's pretty much our own wordpress-like system. This was actually written by one of the devs and is publicly available on his GitHub. I won't say what it's called though. A couple of people designed the thing, it took near 2 months. Here's a image of the initial commit and development commits:- [picture](
  
  
Funding for the website was raised using the address [LMzSrQekR17Jy2nAyoA6XZLxZQUQ45kY4f](
The total for the address is currently: 175.23022663 LTC and there is zero transactions out. Keep in mind that this is funding for both litecoin.org and litecoin.com. That's no more than $500 at most, and since all the work was done through voluntary work, all of the people were donated some LTC from another address. I don't remember who paid it off, by I think was from the Litecoin Association.

The other answers you got weren’t the best... back in the day, when the first altcoin Namecoin was created, it shared the same mining algorithm as Bitcoin. Both had a block time of 10mins. 
What happened is: when Bitcoin was more profitable to mine than Namecoin, all Namecoin miners would mine Bitcoin. Since the difficulty to solve the blocks is so high, the miners still mining Namecoin would take significantly longer than 10 minutes. This was until the next block retarget (every 2016 blocks), where the difficulty would fall by a ton. This then made namecoin a lot easier and profitable to mine. Bitcoin miners would quickly start mining Namecoin, and due to the large number of Bitcoin miners and low difficulty, blocks would be solved way faster than 10mins. So this is why it’s very unlikely there will be two successful networks both with the name Proof of Work algorithm.

Litecoin has a different fee implementation, where each output has a larger fee. Dust txs would be a lot more expensive on Litecoin than Bitcoin. Not only that, the Litecoin network average new block time is around 2.5mins compared to Bitcoin's 10mins, this naturally means that Litecoin has 4x the transaction capacity of Bitcoin...
And now with SegWit, that 4x txs capacity is more like 8x that of Bitcoin.

That isn't exactly true. UASF was probably the biggest reason for why they agreed to SegWit as a MASF. I'll quote the roundtable for you, regarding the 'block size'.


The mentioned 'solution' can be anything, including flex cap or any other dynamic solution. 0.5MB per block which is like Bitcoin having 4MB full blocks (without SW), this is likely not going to happen on Litecoin for a while. Even if all Bitcoin users transition to Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-04-22 18:12:31
When Litecoin does get 50% full blocks, it would be like Bitcoin having 4MB blocks (without SW on BTC). Litecoin, because of it different tx fee system, is more resistant to a spam attack.
It will likely take a very long time for this 50% target to be reached. At that point, the members of the roundtable may not even exist. This is free to pure speculation, as no one can tell what is going to happen that far in the future.

The Litecoin max block size is 1MB just like Bitcoin. But the block intervals for Litecoin is 2.5 compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes. That means over a period of 10 mins, 4MB of blocks can be mined, whilst in Bitcoin 1 block can be mined (on average).
This gives LTC a 4x max capacity over Bitcoin, and with SegWit activated, it will be closer to 8x.

Lamborghini gave the car to Pope Francis so the Catholic Church could auction it for charity.
The auction happened at Sotheby’s, and the winning bid was approx $800K. Unfortunately the bidder was unable to pay this. So the Catholic Church worked with Omaze to raffle off the car in a sweepstake, where 80% of revenue would go to charity.

This is a stupid way of thinking.
Most merchants, unless they are hardcore believers, will always want Bitcoin to be auto converted to fiat, as long as they feel they can spend it anywhere themselves. But if more and more merchants accept Bitcoin, eventually they will no longer need to auto convert all of their bitcoin to fiat. As time goes on, Bitcoin penetration will increase...
However if only hardcore merchants accept Bitcoin, then it’ll take a very long time to see any adoption at all.

@_date: 2016-10-09 01:10:16
So I took a look at the Source code for one of the apps listed: Ocean.
It looks like they forked from BreadWallet to build their own application - i.e. slightly customised UI. [Here's a comparison for the differences between the latest version of BreadWallet]( Notice that there are new files... it seems like they used an old version of BreadWallet.
However the app does use an SDK for ads, through Flurry. So I wouldn't say that this app is unsafe - as in it doesn't steal private keys or coins - but instead just sells ads. Need to take a more in depth look to actually confirm that there is some sort of exploit.
@_date: 2016-10-09 00:48:41

I feel that Core+101 is the way to go.
Your prediction on the code add splitting is understandable, but for a coin which is as small as Litecoin with smaller number of clients, I don't think we need to worry about that. As long as you create an alert for a Litecoin update there will probably be a large number of usage. There is a lot more agreement in the block size increase in the Litecoin company.

I know how version control works.
In big companies, when critical changes are being made, multiple persons have to review that change. It good practice, even if you have owner/admin privileges over that repository. 
From what you are saying, it seems like you are saying you want only one owner for Bitcoin who can dictate what changes go through and what don't. What if someone paid that person to delete that repo? Bitcoin is a distributed open source project, you can't have one person making all the descisions.
I understand that people should fork one branch and make changes, but Core is the most used client and a lot of people and companies rely on that master branch.

Coinbase adding Litecoin isn't directly related to SegWit. They would've added Litecoin as long as they had enough volume on their exchange. During the segwit pump, GDAX Litecoin volume rose from around $50K to millions of dollars. And thus they added Litecoin.
