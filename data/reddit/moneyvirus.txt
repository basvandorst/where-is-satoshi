You really try to compare with stocks? Stocks are reality bound, with real values behind, regulated by a big marked, marked rules and states. Stocks are less hazardous (deposit guarantee,   
exchange supervisory, states behind company) compared with the easy to manipulate techdemo BTC. And if you would know that you buy big profits only with big risk you would not talk that shit.

Don't focus on only one coin. buy a broad spectrum of coins with different  orientations.
with cryptos it's like on the real life: a broad diversification is the key

bring your money to a bank in your homecountry, buy and hold shares/etfs and so on.
If there are problems, use the constitutional state. but cryptos with no regulations,  anonymity, no state control are the future LOL

not bitcoin... the blockchain technology  (which is much older than the bitcoin) .. but that's no wonder that a 10 year young system, based on modern knowledge and technique, does many thinks better than an &gt;40 year old system. when we use the blockchain in future as a SWIFT network  replacement and the fiat for local payment,  bitcoin has won nothing
