It's not a ban you dumbass. They are shutting down any exchange's that allow unregulated trading, meaning any exchange that doesn't require KYC and I'd verification. Everything will be fine

That's what you call the delusion of someone who only owns Bitcoin. It true that 90% of alts are shitcoins, but calling coins like ethereum, neo, monero, etc is just sillly
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:59:16
You. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:51:34
Are you talking about exchanges that have fiat pairs? If not, binance is one of the best out there if you want to trade alts and Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:16:50
If you have that much Bitcoin you can whale altcoins since most of them don't even have 200 Bitcoin volume daily.

Stop over reacting. Tether isn't valued at 1 usd because they say it is, it's valued at that because that's the idea of tether and people believe it.

Nothing to be happy about. Daily transactions have fallen by almost 50% and a lot of businesses who used to accept Bitcoin refuse to now. Adoption is the ultimate factor that will decide if bitcoin succeeds. Maybe the lightning network can fix it, but I don't see it going mainstream in the near future
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:18:59
The only thing that can break bitcoin is bitcoin itself
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:41:08
Lmao chill out kid. Get your head out of your ass and just look at the facts. Bitcoin Adoption is not increasing, the only reason the price is going up so fast is because people are fomoing in like crazy. The Bitcoin Network is completely clogged up. There are a lot of weak hands who saw some magical coin on the news and decided to spend some cash to see what happens. They are also the type of people who want to get rich quick and that's not the type of user that will help adoption spread.

However long it takes for the fees to be reasonable?

Why post such an outdated article
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:30:18
Chill out, Bitcoin is due for a correction and it will be very healthy if the price drops 20-30%. Bitpay recently announced that they will be implementing bcash on their Network, so there's a reason for the increase in price

Because I think litecoin is very undervalued at the moment, I speculate it will rise over the next couple of weeks. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:09:25
I don't think that would change his mind. He believes Bitcoin is a sort of Ponzi scheme, and that people who made a living of Bitcoin are just lucky because they got in early

Today I made my first purchase of Bitcoin from coinbase, I then transferred my Bitcoin to the electrum wallet. I have a question about the upcoming fork and what I should do before and after it happens.  Should I have my private key saved somewhere before the fork, and after the fork how can i access the new coin? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:54:55
Can someone explain what happens when you mine for Bitcoin without joining a mining pool. Will you generate no revenue as the chances of you solving a block are almost 0? 
I also wanted to clarify if the mining process takes place when a node compiles a block and attempts to solve it, or when the transactions are being picked out from the mempool. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:39:35
I like how using crypto is also accompanied with people who are technologically advanced. Shows that people who think of the future know that crypto is going to be part of it

I'm hoping to double my bitcoin position if everything plays out right during this , wish me luck!
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:47:14
Is that why everything suddenly dropped?

Can someone tell me why whenever I try to create a segwit address using electrum it doesn't have a 3 in the beginning and i can't send bitcoin to it
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:51:05
Thanks. The Reason I was asking is because when I tried setting up a segwit electrum wallet my address would be invalid when I tried to send Bitcoin to it. Is it possible to send from a non segwit to a segwit wallet
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:18:27
That's ambitious...
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:29:49
I've recently sold all my Bitcoin and invested into litecoin. Not because I think it's about to skyrocket, but i think it's a safe investment during a time of uncertainty. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:17:08
What happens to Bitcoin if net neutrality gets destroyed? Are they related 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:35:08
Why sell if bitcoin goes up to such a large number.. at that point Bitcoin will be accepted everywhere so there will be no need to sell
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:49:10
Is the operation dragon den just fud spreading? Am I stupid for wanting to sell my Bitcoin now and buy again after the price of Bitcoin is supposed to go down from this operation
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:46:36
Still better than coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:43:45
I haven't noticed any fees. Inside the wallet there is an option to select how fast you want transaction's to proceed, but I didn't get any btc taken when I moved mine

Gdax doesn't work in some countries

Hello , a couple questions from a beginner. 
1) After the hard fork where will I be able to sell b2x for btc?
2) Since coinbase will split the coin after the fork for me, should I leave my btc in coinbase to avoid extra fees? I know it's risky to keep the coin inside an exchange but I only have a small amount and I don't yet fully understand how to avoid replay attacks during a fork. 
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:00:32
This will probably make Bitcoin only stronger but this kind of manipulation needs to stop if crypto is to become mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:00:18
Like 50 years into the future. That way I can check the price chart and see if and when Bitcoin goes down and if it's still relevant

Why shouldn't I keep my private keys on my computer. Isn't that the whole point of wallets? Where should I keep them if I don't have a hardware wallet

Yea, and if you buy a couple hundred dollars worth 5 cad turns out to be like 2%. Much better than coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:34:39
.12 x 3 = .25?
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:44:07
Yea... Bitcoin isnt a stock that once it crashes down never comes back up. Of course it could happen, but I believe that Bitcoin will prevail.

Is there a way to use a segwit address with a desktop electrum wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:45:45
I don't invest more than I can lose. The only thing we agreed on is that bitcoin can crash at any moment. But anything beside that would be responded with "it's all a pyramid scheme made to fool people"

You do realize a correction is much bigger than an increase . Doesn't matter if something increases by a billion % , if it goes down 100% it's worthless
