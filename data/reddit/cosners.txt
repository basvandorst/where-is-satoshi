Supposed to in the sense that it's what makes the most sense to do. And yeah you can save up for stuff but you're not looking to sit on it like a nest egg, you're looking to spend it to get what you want in the end. Just stockpiling money like people are currently stockpiling bitcoins is financially harmful because it's guaranteed to go down in value no matter what you do. Which is different from Bitcoin and other investments in that they can potentially increase their value, making them desirable to stockpile until they start decreasing in value, at which point everyone wants to spend or convert them but no merchant would really want to accept them (though other speculators certainly might, because they think it'll still go up in the future).
Bitcoin needs to stabilize for it to be used as a currency but hodlers, the hodl meme, lambos on the moon etc. suggest that people don't really want it to be a currency. If they did, the meme would've been SPEDN. I'm sure at some point people legitimately wanted for it to be used as a currency and reshape the world's financial  systems (which personally I believe it could've been well within the power of Bitcoin to achieve), but so long as people just want to keep converting it back into fiat it'll never happen.

You hodl an emergency fund in case shit hits the fan, but you're supposed to invest or spend it otherwise. The fact that fiat loses its value over time makes it undesirable to just stockpile.

I'll spend it when it's worth what I bought it for ($11,000/btc), not before.

My bitcoin isn't hard-earned but I will definitely be moving it offline soon...

Considering how worthless their currency is right now, Im thinking the idea might be for Petro to displace it. Would be interesting to see the first crypto used as official currency

To be honest I don't think it's ever going to be a currency so long as people hodl in the hope that it'll be worth more usd tomorrow than it was today. And I don't think people will ever stop hodling so long as human greed is a thing sooo...
Btw I'm not a nocoiner, just being realistic. I'm a greedy parasite too

This. I bought in at 11k and have been steadily putting money into it even though it dropped to like 7k. Now it's back at 11k so I haven't really lost any money.

Oh okay, I thought you implied it.

I didn't know you could only do one or the other.
