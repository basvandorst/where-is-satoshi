That's the node you'll want (ln.pizza):

That's the cool part about lightning! You can open one channel with a lightning node, and use this channel to pay other merchants in the lightning network. For example, you could open a single channel with yalls.org (or directly with ln.pizza), and pay for your pizza order, buy a gift card on Fold, read a few articles on Y'alls, play a round of lightning roulette, etc. Your payments are automatically routed via multiple hops to the merchant you are paying.


It depends. Channels have a time window set that are typically anywhere from a few hours to multiple weeks. If you are only spending funds in your channel, you can't lose funds. The only way you can lose funds is if you are both sending and receiving on a channel, and your counterparty decides to commit an old version of the channel state to the blockchain. You need to be online to contest this. In the future there will be mechanisms (watchtowers) to trustlessly ask someone else to watch for this to occur.

I'm sorry, but that's slower... I can unlock my phone, open an app, click 2 buttons, and wait 3 seconds, or I can slide a card and wait a second. One of those is obviously faster. 
There will likely be a better solution in the future, possibly even one that is faster than credit cards, but I have yet to see it.

Honestly, the best way to implement this is as cash back. Don't provide a 1% discount for the consumer - this is effectively meaningless to a lot of people. There's a reason credit card companies don't just give you a discount, but instead give you cash back (actually, there are several).
Give me 3% cash back, and a way to buy bitcoin without a fee, and the incentives start to be stronger to use it. Right now, I pay an extra 1% to buy bitcoins, have to deal with volatility, and don't get any consumer protection. Why the hell would I use it?

I probably wouldn't put it in the letter I hand to my boss, but depending on your relationship with them, it might come up when talking to them.

Publishing the hash in the blockchain proves that the image was created before a certain time. By embedding data from the newest block into the picture, you can prove that the picture was taken after a certain time.
tldr; It also lets you prove it was taken after a certain time.
edit: I was wrong

So, how do I handle this if I mined a few coins in 2010 / 2011?
@_date: 2014-10-23 00:18:34
edit: Yep, you're right. :)

This also wouldn't handle people in buildings since they could be at a variety of elevations in one location.

I wish NFC worked on the lock screen, or with the screen off rather than having to go through the awkward process of unlocking NY phone and placing it on the scanner. Maybe something where I can hold the power button down, and can scan it.

This is exactly right. If it's &gt; 100% an attack is possible. If it's greater than 300% an attack is quite doable since Nicehash sells fixed rate contracts where others can't outbid you, but only for ~1/3 of their capacity. 
The point of the site was to show how at risk the smaller coins for each algorithm are. The about page on the site goes into more detail on how everything was calculated - I'm glad to answer any questions you may have.

Does anyone know what the storage tokens cost? It mentions that they are purchased when you first open a lightning network channel, but doesn't mention what they cost:

Between their app and website, they accept onchain, lightning, and credit card.

I've been using Shango with LND and have been pretty happy with it. The ui is a little bit buggy, but once I learned its quarks it's been pretty good.
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:44:08
Agreed. Average cost is a horrible metric here.

If you're okay with onboarding directly to lightning, Sparkswap is pretty amazing.
Funds are instantly available, and the fee is ~0.15%.

The ability to withdraw will be added before the end of the year.

Cryptocurrencies solve 2 fundamental problems that credit cards have:
* chargebacks / fraud
* fees
Merchants that accept credit cards pay anywhere from 2-3% in fees, and have to deal with chargebacks from fraudulent purchases. Bitcoin solves both of these problems by effectively acting as cash on the internet. These fees are especially problematic for low margin merchants and for merchants with high rates of fraud.
Adoption of Bitcoin is still small enough that it isn't yet worth it to merchants to adopt, but at some point it will, and these reduced fees will allow merchants to pass some of these savings back to the users in the form of rewards.

No chargebacks, no 2-3% transaction fees, money is available immediately (vs after 30 days in some cases for credit cards). I could go on.

Very true. Is there a technical reason why Bitcoin couldn't be modified to make it so transactions can't be modified (besides adding to the transaction fee)? This way anyone can look in the mempool, and see upcoming transactions, and can verify themselves to approve the transaction. To prevent future transactions from going through first, and causing someone to overspend, we could add an incrementing id to transactions, and have nodes only process in order transactions. (I'm sure I'm missing something here)

I took your advice and paid 31sat / byte, and it's been unconfirmed for 4 hours. I guess that is what I get for listening to advice on the internet...
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:55:38
What wallet do people use? I am trying to use the Bitcoin Core wallet, and it wants the fee to be specified in BTC / kilobyte. Which means I have to convert from sat / byte, which sucks.
