Bitcoin doesn't do what it was meant to do well, just fyi. It was supposed to be peer-to-peer transfer but has turned into a store of value. And that's okay.

A great watch regarding the implications and potential loss of of liberty, the most notable of which is transferred intent:

If your parents are rational, reasonable people, perhaps persuade them with education. If they are, explain how it works, what it's benefits are, it's year over year return, etc. If they think it's a scam and won't even listen then you probably won't have much luck in this approach.
Another approach would be to make the argument that it's your money and you should be able to spend it how you want. Would they try to stop you if it was a new computer? New clothes? Stocks? If they wouldn't have an issue such purchases, point this out to them, explain you know the risks, and that this is how you want to spend your money.
I don't know your parents, but if they're not rational and reasonable people you might not be able to persuade them. In which case, you could simply buy it anyway (that's what I would do), or perhaps wait until you're eighteen to try to ease relations with them.
Most importantly, keep a level head when addressing them about it.

Facebook is not a monopoly - not even close.
Facebook's customers are its advertisers; its users and its user's data are the product. Virtually all of Facebook's customers - the advertisers - use multiple service providers to promote their services, Facebook being but one of them.  In this regard, the vast majority of the commercial internet is an alternative provider, and other mediums (such as television advertising) offer many substitutes. 
Even if we consider Facebook's users as customers, Facebook still doesn't have a monopoly. There are other general providers such as Google+, Twitter, Reddit, and MeetMe, alternative providers such as Snapchat, Vine, and Pinterest, niche providers such as the thousands of forums online (most with several leaders per niche) and other niche social networks, as well as alternatives for individual services and features that Facebook offers, such as traditional email or chat programs for their messaging feature. If there are many social networks, how is Facebook a monopoly? 
Additionally, the regulation and patent issue still stands; I haven't ready the 56 patents, but there are likely several that would prevent a competitor that closely resembles Facebook. Even one patent could effectively grant a monopoly to a company.
Facebook is an industry leader. I see no way it could realistically be considered a monopoly.

It would make it difficult to purchase bitcoin, so it could cripple acquisition... but with bank failures, I think it would still drive the price up. It would just be difficult to attain.
I'm not sure how acquiring bitcoins would work in such a failure, but the alternative is pretty bleak in a fiat collapse.
@_date: 2016-06-27 05:26:07
BTCJAM is legit. Just be careful on which loans you back. I'm a lender who's paid back loans and can say it's a great service. They've recently increased thier standard for borrowers so if I was going to loan bitcoins that's where I would do it.

I'm only a casual trader but I agree with the other two posters. Perhaps there was a time you could trade based on the order spread but those days are past. You have huge wales, sometimes aided by advanced trading bots, constantly manipulating both Buy and sell orders. 
I would only trust the spread on a small exchange I was confident had a low degree of manipulation. I know of no such exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:02:23
Regarding the block size, I believe people like inkhaton and myself are also concerned with the stance taking by the Core development team. It appears they have no intention of ever raising the limit. 2MB is not unreasonable whatsoever in the current ecosystem.
If the limit is never raised from 1MB it would force transactions off chain, which not only is contrary to the original concept and purpose of bitcoin, but it would also make true bitcoin blockchain transactions impossible for many.

It would affect the entire Bitcoin economic ecosystem, including all the multi-million dollar exchanges, wallets, services, associates products/services, altcoin products/services, and associated venture capital.
This impact, in my opinion, would be non-negligible. It may impact certain economic sectors negatively and others positively.
Bitcoin, the amount of investment in coins and the ecosystem, and its overall market cap would have a real impact if the price went to zero or near-zero.
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:58:34
I'm sure there is but I don't know what the equilibrium is. If it's a $5 transaction fee it seems like a $100 buy order is more appropriate. If you're paying $5 on $25 look into alternative payment methods or exchanges with lower fees.
In the case of Coinbase, for example, ACH transfers are about half the amount in fees as debit/credit cards.

Thanks for compiling this. I was doing in depth team research on a promising ICO and intuited a connection to some of these actors. I plan on digging in deeper and will try to share what I’ve gathered. I think we really need to look at the individuals, shell companies, and capital behind these activities to paint a more dimensional picture.
When we think of Bitfinex and Tether being managed by the same two individuals it’s easy to forget there is an enormous amount of money not just managed by these companies, but likely still within these companies, and more importantly there is capital that financed and built these companies (or the shell of a shell of a patsy).
We need to define the players more comprehensively and follow the money. 
Maybe we should hire Ledger Labs to do some forensic trace and end-point analysis.
These are extremely wealthy people.

It can work if bitcoin is to act as a settlement layer with very high fee transactions all 95+% of transactions off-chain (SegWit/LN/etc).
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:08:40
If I were a malicious actor, I might find a way to discreetly encourage or cause a last minute, pre-mature fork of bitcoin months before the anticipated November fork, in an attempt to shake miners out of the NYA agreement, ultimately leading to the failure of said agreement, the avoidance of an economic hard fork, and the preservation of my interests.

@_date: 2017-05-29 21:34:05
I agree and I think competition in this space is needed. However, I believe competition in mining is a better solution than a UASF.
What the Core/UASF camp AND the BU/2-4MB camp fail to realize is that there is a centralization risk both ways. Right now we have a high degree or mining centralization. This should be addressed.
With the UASF to Segwit there will be an opportunity for further centralization by those in power, as large companies act as payment channels on top of Bitcoin. While this is not yet the case and may not be so for a year or two, it's a real risk that we might not be able to come back from - namely if there's a conflict of interest with the Core developers. 
THAT is why half of the Bitcoin community opposes Segwit and a UASF. It is not that they inherently oppose SegWit, they oppose freezing the block size limit indefinitely, because it IS a centralization risk as well. Both camps are right.
I do not know for certain that such a conflict of interest exists, but if they refuse to raise the actual block size limit from 1mb that is an indicator, as they've failed to do for years.
I agree that an overly large block chain will, in time, develop into centralization of nodes, but it would only be a moderate degree. A 2mb or 4mb limit is not unreasonable; most users could still run it.
I guess what I'm saying is miner centralization is a threat that should be addressed through market competition, and that though mining already has a high degree of centralization it doesn't seem to pose much immediate risk, as miners will act in their best interest.
I support Segwit, but I believe that REAL block size increases are essential, and should be coded into the software. Otherwise powerful parties can refuse to ever raise the limit; in 2-5 years most transactions could be forced to take place on Segwit/Lighting/Off-Chain. The risk of this outweighs the current risk of mining centralization, in my humble opinion. If what I described does take place, and the 1MB limit is never raised, it will be the death of the idea of Bitcoin, and Bitcoin will become a substitute for the system we already have.
Act carefully, my friends.

Another factor is that one might assume they can withdraw normally (as they should be able to) unless there's a higher overall transaction number on the Bitcoin blockchain. Even if there is, paying a premium fee $5 should provide a speedy reception of funds.
