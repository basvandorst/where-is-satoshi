Or you can try to explain how he's wrong.
If you were falling back on gold's ability to be used to make spoons, then you wouldn't be using it for value storage, you'd be using it for spoons.
If you then started using the spoons for trade or value storage then the value of the spoons would increase beyond their value as just spoons, making the fact that they are spoons not important to their trade.

Apple keeps their phone specs as secret as they can pretty much until release day (pointed out in the article, btw).
I think it's unfair to say that there is "no substantative information at all". You can argue that the author is lying, and therefore the information is not supportive. But I dont think that you can argue that it isn't supportive evidence if the author is being truthful.
And the author could certainly be lying -- but what reason do we have to believe this?

As I have already explained, bitfinex is just using a slightly modified bitcoinica source code.
Bitcoinica was not very in-the-market, and so neither is bitfinex.
That is, Bitcoinica didn't have anywhere near funds equal to the leverage amounts they provide users, to actually trade on the market, and neither does Bitfinex.
To be even more clear, there is not enough deposit for lending to cover the total amount lent. Not even close.
[The link you gave]( does not tell you anything about whether this is a bucket shop. That is just trade history.
If you still don't understand, consider this example:
You make a 10000 BTC sell order on bitfinex. Bitfinex lets you place the trade, even if there is only 1000 BTC deposited at bitfinex.
Now bitfinex has two options.
Option 1. They let the bitfinex price float freely and base it on the MtGox price. If they do, they they have significant incentive to place a large buy order on MtGox to move the price against you (this is why bucketshops are outlawed in many places). They could also go bankrupt if the price moves in your favor, and they have to pay you more money than they can afford.
Option 2. They do what Bitcoinica did (likely, since they use their source code, and since it is almost zero risk to bitfinex). The bitfinex price doesn't move lower than your sell price until other bitfinex users also sell. The price can float up with mtgox price though, because this is a loss to you and therefore no risk to bitfinex. This leads to the problem (like Bitcoinica had) where the bitcoinica price became very detached from the MtGox market price. The MtGox price was rising, and everyone wanted to buy, but the bitcoinica price froze and wouldn't rise, to protect bitcoinica, because they didn't really have enough money to lend for margin, and so they would have to pay a large amount of money to everyone buying if they actually raised the bitcoinica price.
If you're still not convinced, think of it this way:
If bitfinex gives you 10:1 margin, then the only way they will have enough money to lend you from user deposits, is if 90% of the deposited cash is simply not used for trading.
They don't *actually have* 10 times your money to lend you for margin -- you are mostly just placing bets against other users about what the price will do, rather than actually influencing the market with real margin lends. In this way, they are a bucket shop.

# Question 1:
So I see some amounts on the credit book here:

Is this an amount available for lending to users, or is this an amount already being lent? Or is this an amount that you can lend to bitfinex?

Yes... they are a bucket shop.
They mostly aren't in the market -- they fill your trades against bets with other users, and the money isn't actually being traded on an exchange. You and I can bet on where the price will go, but we aren't actually affecting what the price will do by doing that.
If on the other hand, I buy bitcoins (or sell them), I am both profiting/losing on the price movement and also affecting the price.
Bitfinex doesn't allow it's users to actually affect the price with orders, and more importantly, has a strong incentive to influence the price themselves on the actual market, liquidating your account and keeping your money. It would be very hard to tell when they have done this.
Put another way, they could easily place a buy order on mtgox, when you have placed a sell order on bitfinex, causing you to lose money which they can then keep.

I'm sure they jumped up and down with excitement when an exchange was randomly hacked just a week after they spread those silly pastebin messages.
If they really hacked Bitcoin7, they would have defaced the page as proof, and announced that they were going to hack it the day before. They would not have announced that they "have the database" of several exchanges a week before they *hack* an exchange.
After all, they've been saying that they have the database info all along.
In this OP message, they say that they *bought* the databases. If they bought the databases, did they also buy the admin passwords? Are exchange admins selling their databases so that they have plausible deniability when they are hacked? I doubt it, since their server records would simply show someone logging in and taking everything -- how is that any better than the admin doing that himself from a random library computer?
If a server admin wanted to take off with everyone's bitcoins, they wouldn't sell the database.

In Canada for example, you buy a plan at the bank that gives you a certain number of transactions per month. For students, your account is free, and you get 25 free transactions, after which it costs something like $0.50 - $1.00 per debit transaction (I don't recall the exact number).
For non-students, the cheapest account you can get is typically about $4 - $12 per month (unless you maintain a $1500+ account balance), and you get around 10-25 debit transactions for free, after which you pay about $1.00 per transaction.
**$4/month for 10 transactions per month, plus $1.00 per transaction.**
***$1.00 per debit transaction!***
Want more transactions? Either buy a more expensive plan, or pay the per transaction fees.

You know, it seems like the Jalapeno might wind up being better than the SC, if the Jalapenos are overclockable (like the SC is claimed to be), which is pretty ridiculous.
The Jalapeno has 2 chips per radiator.
The SC has 8 chips per radiator, and the SC radiators can't be much bigger, since the new SC case is not that much bigger.
So the Jalapeno will be more easily cooled, and will be more redundant.
If a Jalapeno dies -- no big deal. If an SC dies, it's a much bigger problem.
If the Jalapenos overclock more easily than the SCs, then the performance to price ratio becomes equal to or better than the SCs!
The Jalapenos will probably also be more easily resold, since they are less expensive.
