The current meaning of anarchism as a political philosophy is very much the same as it was when Proudhon first coined it, though. You know, the "property is theft" guy.

Good luck with the audit!

Anarchists, by the original 19th century definition, *are* radical far-left activists. Quite close to socialists ideologically, and occasionally also violent.

Fascinating, do you also have other absurd personal beliefs you'd like to share?

Money indeed can be exchanged for goods and services!

Ok, so you've paid the 10% atm fee. How do you think you'll avoid the capital gains tax down the line?

I'm a Venezuelan bitcoin whale. I sell all these fake Venezuelans bitcoins and happily accept their rapidly depreciating bolivars in return because
@_date: 2017-02-21 10:03:07
Why do you think buying from an ATM exempts you from capital gains tax?

It's almost as if different countries have different laws!

Luckily in your imagination they have you around, a very manly internet tough guy ready to whiteknight them, beating those miscreants to *a bloody fucking pulp!!*
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:58:07
Lol, tell us more about how you'd beat this imaginary guy in your imagination *to a bloody fucking pulp!!!*
@_date: 2017-01-15 01:00:59
Does it help?

Satoshi confirmed.

Satoshi does, with his invisible hands.

Did this happen to you too:

That's a surefire way to put your sordid internet past behind you! There's no way anyone could find those tweets now!
@_date: 2017-01-21 00:39:16
Lol, nope.

This is actually good for btc-coin.
