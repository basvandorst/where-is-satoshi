Yup, because the valuation method doesn't indicate the value of a *hodler*. It is almost impossible to calculate or estimate the value of a hodler nowadays! Look at Facebook/Google/Amazon/Uber/Airnbn, they dont fit in the old valuation schema, because they depend on other factors..
I think its the same with Blockchain. It is in its early stages and nobody nows the true value of it, thus it can not be compared with existing businesses.
Dont look at the prices on the exchanges, they depend on nothing!
