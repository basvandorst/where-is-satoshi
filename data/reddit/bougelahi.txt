Just made one! :) 
@_date: 2012-12-01 18:47:00
thanks for doing this btw :) this is exciting haha
@_date: 2012-12-16 00:19:55
I have had this problem recently. Bitinstant can fix it super quick they just need their support to look at it. It may be Monday =\
@_date: 2012-12-28 16:43:51
I don't believe it is a scam because they are not taking any pre orders for these chips. They only needed an initial investment for these chips to be put through the fab. These chips do not need to meet any unbelievable hashing claims made by BFL, bASIC, or the like they only need to work. But no one will know until they start hashing :)
@_date: 2012-12-26 04:40:47
ho ho ho
@_date: 2012-12-29 00:23:07
Yeah, I happen to be an investor so this is quite exciting to see! =]
@_date: 2012-12-28 22:41:22
No. The initial investments were sold as shares to the company. There were only a certain number of shares released and since GLBSE went down there has been no public trading.

I didn't say that I just believe it to be very unlikely to be a scam. I would expect him to run with the money if that was all he was after. He has provided lots of updates throughout the process with the newest update being these pictures of actual chips. I don't believe it is a scam as I said, but we will not know until they start hashing, as I said.

Bitfloors been great in my experience!
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:54:11
I would wager that some big buys happen tomorrow but we shall see. Too late for me to keep watching haha 
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:10:53
You can trade before verification with mt gox. I also decided to try bitfloor.com and it was great
@_date: 2013-07-03 15:21:40
Same here...haha. I don't see how the price could jump this much, unless there's a bunch of sales we don't know about. Even if that happened I don't see sales keeping that pace for a long time with competitors rolling out
@_date: 2013-03-30 22:38:10
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:43:10
Hehe, I knew.
But really, this is great.
@_date: 2013-03-18 19:55:13
Will you let us know when you start?
@_date: 2013-05-05 19:39:12
Are mtgox trades on the blockchain or a separate system?
@_date: 2013-07-08 01:58:08
I've gotten it every time I try recently. Would love an explanation..
@_date: 2013-03-31 15:45:30
I bought a nexus 7 and accessories using  :) was very easy, they use coinbase for payments
EDIT: Nexus came today :) Thanks bitcoinrunner!

From  frontpage:
"The BTC-e, Bitstamp and Bitcoin address and Bitcoin-to-email options are temporarily offline for system updates. These options should be back up on Monday, February 25. We apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience while we run these upgrades."

This was before any physical proof of an ASIC really existed from any of the companies claiming to compete. ASICMINER was quietly confident they would be the leader in the ASIC race, but there were many haters ready to say it was another scam. This picture was the first ASICMINER chips friedcat showed to us, and now theyre hashing a good chunk of the network and selling devices :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:28:30
I got them from bitmit.met, as well as the bitcointalk forums ( Everything went smoothly
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:04:58
I remember Colbert pointing out that it sounded like a "Pyramid Scheme" and then talking about Satoshi
@_date: 2013-03-11 17:20:21
When ASICMINER showed their chips there were a lot of trolls. The trolls were saying "ASICS will never exist," not "BFL will never ship." It was a different type of trolling. When I posted an ASICMINER update with pictures of chips, plenty of people were doubtful they were real.
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:41:15
You are exactly what I need right now!
@_date: 2013-03-05 05:09:51
My receipt! - 
@_date: 2013-02-02 07:26:58
From Bitinstant, "In receiving those funds, BitInstant acts as an agent and payment processor for various exchanges and other merchants, such as [MtGox, ...]. "
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:20:08
I love seeing you around, haha
@_date: 2013-05-12 16:43:50
Asicminer has over 25% of the network. Pretty successfull imo
@_date: 2013-02-14 18:04:21
:D SO EXCITED!!!!!!
Friedcat you are a boss!
@_date: 2013-02-28 00:44:33
We did it! To new heights from here :)
@_date: 2013-03-02 16:25:43
Expanding on what Lilpoboy1978 said, I just got back from the bank from using bitfloor. The money was waiting in my account when I got home and trading for BTC was incredibly easy. I now have my BTC in my own wallet, much more than I would have with Bitinstant. So, I can personally recommend  ! Very fast and easy
@_date: 2013-07-18 02:13:56
This is exclusively from (mining and some limited USB sales). This statement is true. Not "this is exclusively mining"
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:05:17
I was gonna. teleported to 43. now its about to be 45 unbelievable
@_date: 2013-03-30 04:16:02
I bought a couple times today, they were pretty random hours so I guess that is why. Also very small orders.
@_date: 2013-07-03 14:46:41
yes, multiple.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:32:22
TeamLiquid fighting!! My favorite team! Buying shirts now :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:17:47
Bitinstant still has my bitcoin from a purchase they marked as completed. I would stay away.
EDIT: Order sent to my account. Bitinstant is fine I would say.
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:00:43
Oh wow this is so cool! I'm in the US but I'd love to try it out
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:28:54
@_date: 2013-07-12 06:32:08
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:23:59
Got some at 180. I'll take it haha
@_date: 2013-02-13 02:57:52
hope you got a good price ;)
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:11:46
Alex Grey and his wife will be having a show thingy in my town tomorrow. I hope that I can go!
@_date: 2013-03-05 04:31:31
Donated $40.00 to charitywater.org! PM'ing with details :) this is AMAZING!!!!!
@_date: 2013-07-03 14:59:06
estimated .015 from mining, I'm guessing more than .01 per share for sales. Maybe .03
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:12:40
bitcoin is faster than reddit consistently lately lol
@_date: 2013-02-17 21:20:34
You can trade without verification up to a certain amount of BTC on MtGox
@_date: 2013-07-03 15:55:39
I do believe over 5000 miners were sold though. BTCGuild sold out 1,000 in less than an hour, as just one reseller
@_date: 2013-02-15 04:16:34
I'm within 125 comments :)
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:58:16
I predicted $100 by April 1st last weekend to my friends. I feel it could be a quite volatile week for Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-02-02 06:22:17
As soon as the Moneygram company tells Bitinstant that they received your cash, bitinstant buys bitcoin off of a choice of a few exchanges for the best available price. It is the time of payment, not the time of the creation of the payment slip that is important.
@_date: 2013-07-03 02:21:53
This is not all of ASICMINER's stock of USB's to sell...This is one reseller's.
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:54:01
Haha hilarious.
PS you absolutely rule shakethatbass!
@_date: 2013-02-13 02:26:34
Now it's at 1 THash/s apparently wow
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:04:46
Nexus 7, accessories, steam games, other stuff I can't think of
@_date: 2013-06-15 00:49:14
I would provide some funds. Count me in!
