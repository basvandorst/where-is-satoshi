I get that, but I want to know if the "price" I set these orders at is the price of 1 coin (for ex. $1500) or the price of the *amount of coin I am selling* (for ex. I'm selling 0.75btc, 1 is worth $1500 so I enter the price as $1125 (75% of $1500)

As far as I am aware you cannot buy without the (fiat) money already being in your GDAX account, so the situation you describe couldn't occur.  So if right now BTC is at $15300 and you think 'i want a piece of that' you would need to have some $$$ in  your GDAX account already.  If you didn't have money ready then you would need to do your transfer, wait 24 hours and THEN buy - but you would be buying at the price it's at 24 hours later.  What you describe is buying on credit, which you can do on some exchanges (Gemini I think) but not on GDAX (unless I am wrong).

Thank you :) Good job I asked then, I was sure it would be the price of how much coin I had so could well have sold what I'm holding on GDAX for fack all.

Sorry, fiat is your 'normal' money - so USD, EUR etc.  You would need to wait as long as it takes for that normal money to transfer from your bank to coinbase/gdax.  So 3 days if your bank takes that long to do a transfer.  I can usually get money from my bank to gdax/coinbase in 1 24 hours.

The irony.

You need to have the fiat balance in your account before you can buy.  So I wire from my bank to Coinbase, then login to GDAX and instantaneously transfer that fiat from Coinbase over to GDAX (as they are basically the same company).  I now have $xxx in my GDAX account to play with and buy with that.  Any successful trades are debited/credited immediately. I could be wrong but I don't think GDAX let you buy on credit like Gemini do - which I think is what you were eluding to at the end.

Yes, using GDAX rather than Coinbase means you don't pay fees (if you use a limit sell/buy order).  I transfer my fiat into Coinbase, then over to GDAX and buy/sell from there.
