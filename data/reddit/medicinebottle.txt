I find that rotating organizers can be helpful.  If people lose interest have them resign and then add new energetic people who like organizing events.  We started with 6 organizers, dropped down to 4 and then added a fifth to give us a boost.  I am actually thinking about implementing an organizer term.  You can only organizer for 1 year or something like that. Will add Melbourne meetup in next months list!

I contacted them via customer service. If your not physically in Canada you cannot withdraw CAD. Also withdraw fee is 1% minimum 10 dollars. Not the best deal. But trading fees are very competitive and their platform is very adequate.  Having to physically be in Canada is bullshit imho.

I used them for about 1.5 years and received mediocre service the whole time.  Too many red flags popped up for me and I closed my account 6 months ago.  I strongly recommend Canadians to move to Vault of Satoshi.  Cavirtex is not developing and improving with the bitcoin community. They were useful 2 years ago, not today.

I just arrived.  Thanks for the offers, but I already offered to buy a hotdog for anyone on the Korean bitcoin forum.  If there are too many people, which I don't expect, I may take up one of your offers.

As I wrote in another thread "If this is being called an ATH then I want to correct it and say that I sold bitcoins in 2013 for more than $1580USD on a Korean bitcoin exchange called Korbit. I still have all the trade history from those trades. This is the real ATH as far as I know. And I wasn't even the highest price of the day that day!" 
@_date: 2014-08-02 11:45:21
I booked a hotel last month using Expedia and just had to cancel it due to a typhoon south of Korea.  I was worried I would not be able to get my btc back because I don't have a coinbase account.  I was however pleasantly surprised that they immediately send my refund to coinbase and I only had to log in with a new account to withdraw my refund.  This process kicks the SH^% out of credit cards.  Bitcoin wins by KO! Thanks
@_date: 2015-05-28 00:45:29
How do I get my account back?  The forgot password function is not working?

Vault of satoshi is the way to go.  Very well run. I agree with some of the comments below. Stay away from Cavirtex

Every case is different.  I do what you are talking about every month and I have earned money remitting money every single time.  I send form SK to Canada.  2.9% to sell bitcoin is absolutely horrendous.  My costs are 0% to buy, 0.2% to sell, and exactly $7.50CAD to withdraw Canadian dollars to my bank acct.  I will hopefully never use the banks ever again! 
@_date: 2014-08-03 09:32:29
I'm going to head over there tomorrow for a hotdog.  Will post a pic if I can figure out how. :)

I'm a mod on BTT and I agree that the admins should have some sort of term they serve and then get replaced by someone else.  And I also agree that writing new forum software at a cost of 1 million dollars is outrageous!

Lighthouse made this faster, easier and cheaper than anything before it. Cool to be trying out new technologies. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:01:50
Good point, sorry that made no sense did it?  I meant to say that an the ATH as far as I've seen took place on Korbit that day.  I will look it up later today to see what is was on that day.  I think it was around November 30th 2013.  I will double check it. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 06:04:39
This is really really cool but I don't understand, I post [this]( and get 46 upvotes and this post gets 600+?  Where's the love?  I do like to see more options with bitcoin anyways, great job! 
@_date: 2016-01-11 06:31:35
Lighthouse is no longer being supported.  Koreanbuddy.com should be added to lists like this :)
@_date: 2015-05-11 03:42:12
3%? That's quite a high rate.  What is the rate on their website.  Do you mean 0.3%?
@_date: 2016-01-06 02:40:54
If you are a bit of an advanced user you can use [Mycellium Gears]( That way you control the bitcoin 100% and pay 0 fees. 
@_date: 2016-01-23 13:30:59
Yes, these suck.  I will start reporting them!

My clock shows 00:30UTC and still no activity on Bitfinex?

Still waiting on a fully functional, user friendly mobile wallet.  Mycelium was getting close, but then lost their way a couple years ago. The rest are all lacking features.

Do they have their own website.  I can add groups that aren't on meetup.com as well.

I think I heard about a site like that a while back on bitcoin talk, but not sure.  I will check it out.  I will also add the Switzerland meetup.  Doing a comparison of meetup members vs country population is interesting, maybe by individual city populations is better.  Will look into it.  Thanks

Need to see some proof of this. This is just conspiracy.

It's more about collecting the required documents than it is waiting for the exchanges to verify you.  The days of waiting weeks for verification are over.  These exchanges will usually verify you within 24 hours if you have submitted correct info and valid documents.  I enjoy using both Bitfinex and Kraken.  It also depends on what features you want and which currencies you want to use.  Being verified on both also has advantages. 
@_date: 2019-12-06 05:28:05
Amen to that, Reddit mods can really F things up.  I'm sure they do a lot of good too, just harder to see that part.
@_date: 2016-02-16 13:38:33
Checking member totals was manual and the rest was mostly automated in the spreadsheet.  I have stopped doing this now because I started a company and am too busy. Maybe someone can take over for me.  I should look into that.
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:14:23
My company KoreanBuddy accepts Bitcoin directly and have done so since day 1. We accept another 20+ currencies as well.

Sure, he broke the law and he admits it.  Maybe he got was he deserved and maybe not, but he never ripped anyone off.  I don't know where you got that from?  The US justice system is far from perfect, you don't have to accept it as the "right" decision.  I think the result is fucked up, I think marijuana should be legal everywhere.  I sent him a letter, do as you like.

it's not rocket science.  I just check up the totals on meetup.com for each group each month.  If people click on join this meetup they are counted in the member total.  The absolute numbers aren't that interesting actually, it's more about growth.  Next month I will start adding some more advanced statistics like average monthly growth etc. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 05:43:37
