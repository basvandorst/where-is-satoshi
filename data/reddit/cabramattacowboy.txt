I don't see why a price rise is necessary for adoption.  It needs to be perceived to have value to be store of value but that doesn't mean it has to appreciate vs other assets to be a currency.

Constrained supply and potentially unconstrained demand doesn't guarantee infinite price rises though because actual demand is driven by utility.
There is constrained supply of land and fossil fuels too.  They have perceived value but price rises aren't certain.
I think precious metals are the best analogy to cryptocurrencies.  They are difficult to mine.  All the cheaply mined stuff is already mined and owned by someone.  There's a finite amount on Earth and no more can be created or destroyed.  They have little utility as anything other than a store of value, a medium of exchange or a unit of account.  At the moment, they are best as a store of value.  At least with gold and platinum, you can make jewelry from it.  Bitcoin's potential utility is diminished unless it is a proper medium of exchange.  Price volatility undermines that.

Ironically, one of things preventing Bitcoin from being a fully fledged currency is its exchange rate volatility.  Rising another 480k in 3yrs would pretty much kill it as a medium of exchange because who would spend it today when it could be worth a lot more tomorrow?  That means take up by providers of goods and services would also be slowed, partly due to less demand and partly because they would have to deal with exchange rate risk on something which is super volatile.
The best thing for bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies) now would be a long period of exchange rate stability so that consumers and providers can build their trust and infrastructure so that it can serve its intended purpose:  as a currency, not just a speculative position.
