I think it's applicable. If you invest so much money that if stocks (or otherwise) end up being valued at 0, you're in trouble. Only invest so much that you could still survive without the invest.
It is also applicable to gambling though.

That is the big one I think. So many people risk too much on the assumption they'll make quick, easy profit.. that's not always the case!

I think I would be more likely to increase my brand loyalty to a shop/company if they embraced BitCoins in a positive way. The early adopters of this can only benefit from it.
