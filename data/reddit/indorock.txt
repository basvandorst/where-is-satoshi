I think if you're paying attention to the dips you're a fucking dirty day trader and are not actually investing in the future of BTC or cryptocurrency in general.
Your crypto wallet is your nest egg, people. You will need it when the world economy and the fiat markets have their next big crash.

Ahhh yes, I'm sure that one will come out around the same time as Halflife 3
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:41:27
A smart man, surely, but not one who understands much about Bitcoin.

There is no ticket system for deposits, it's automated. That is...if you entered the reference number to the deposit as instructed, the funds will automatically be routed to your account. If you don't add it...well then you're in for a rocky ride.
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:14:55
I mean, it's all anecdotal. I sent my funds to coinbase through SEPA transfer and they were available within a day. On the flipside,  I also deposited to my Kraken account but forgot to add the reference, and as a result it took 3 weeks to hear back from their customer service, and one more week until i finally had my funds on my account. So you can always find fault in any exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:20:41
Wow you are one ignorant human being making bullshit excuses. And it's always people like you who are part of the problem, giving these fucking breeders your money. Way to go! 
"Shelter dogs have issues" (and by implication saying breeded dogs do not) is one of the most ignorant things I have heard all week. Go educate yourself. And stop taking in pets.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:11:16
I did the same to Kraken, but I actually stupidly forgot to add the reference number to my SEPA deposit. So I wonder how long it will take them to help me :-/
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:04:13
Yeah, I thought it's universally known by now that dog breeders are evil. By the downvotes, it seems that having compassion and loving BTC are mutually exclusive to most. That's sad.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:56:27


That's absolute bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:58:03
Haha wow how fucking ignorant are you, seriously? Especially for thinking that pets from breeders don't suffer from mental conditions as a result of a horrific upbringing...educate yourself please.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:55:57
Fuck anyone who buys a pet instead of adopting one
@_date: 2018-09-11 06:14:08
Nope, let's just post pics of Lambos with custom licence plates! The revolution is at the DMV!
@_date: 2018-09-10 19:45:20
WTF does WeChat have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:15:58
One indicator that someone is not a rational or mature investor: They base their decisions on image macros from movies (particularly one where the protagonist loses everything LOL)
One indicator of rational and mature investing is to know when to HODL em and more importantly know when to *FODL* em. And if' you're down 45% and it's likely that will will get worse, now just might be that time. Dumbasses.
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:27:13
Let's wait for some serious global economic turbulence and we'll see if the predictions that crypto will be more resilient than fiat currencies will hold true. My prediction is that the opposite will happen.
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:28:24
So in other words your choice to "diversify" is fucking you.
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:24:01
6 months ago we had idiots like John MacAffee telling us he'll eat his own dick if BTC doesn't hit $1 million by 2020, and this subreddit was eating that shit up like candy and upvoting posts like that to the heavens. 
And by now we all know for damn certain there is no way in hell BTC will even reach 10% of that value by that time. Who the hell would take a psychopath like MacAffee seriously in the first place?
@_date: 2018-08-20 05:12:29
Hah wow that's a pretty brilliant way to scam people and take their shit.
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:19:48
Weak bitcoin create shitposts
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:29:31
if you will label that as "interest", then sure.
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:25:26
i hope they wrote that in pencil
@_date: 2018-08-21 06:10:08
Dude if you're telling someone "Now is the time" then it's quite clear you're inferring that things will be moving in the very near future.
@_date: 2018-08-21 05:23:45
You say that as if we are on the cusp of a revolution in currency....we are not. Bitcoin - even at its peak in value and media attention - is literally still only a tiny drop in the fiscal bucket. We will all die with fiat dominating all markets. The best realistic outcome you can hope for when it comes to BTC is second rate currency on the level of CAD or something. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:20:46
SMH. You realize that a subreddit is not a fan club yeah? You realize that the CEO of a company is very likely following the tweets of their competitors? 
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:22:27
This is so stupid. I wonder how many BTC proponents do understand that it would be ultimately a disaster if the currency remained deflationary, and that that would end up killing it and the economy along with it? I guess OP certainly doesn't.
@_date: 2018-06-27 06:57:59
The tech and the general concept, yes. But you're right, this sub is garbage. People like this are the exact reason why BTC might never see the &gt; $10K days anymore, or not for a long time, and you guys upvote this shit to the heavens. Later. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 06:50:33
Here's what I still don't get about this sub. Are you guys actually into Bitcoin, the technology and the promise of decentralised currencies, or simply into the idea of bling, and doing dumb shit like buying exotic sports cars? Because the dude that bought this car - assuming he did make the money by investing in BTC, meaning he did sell - clearly doesn't actually believe in HODLing or BTC's future potential, and opted instead for converting back to fiat currency so he can pay for fancy toys.
For a group of people that hate pump &amp; dump schemes, you sure spend a lot of time celebrating those who dumped.

So how did Greg eventually end up taking his own life?
@_date: 2018-06-27 10:18:20
Haha that's always the easy out isn't it? "dude it's just a joke chill"  
You realise that it's not this "joke" by itself that's gotten me annoyed, it's the culmination of countless of Lambo-loving posts in this subreddit for months and months. I hate to overuse the expression, but seriously at times this sub is not much more than a Nouveau Riche circlejerk.
@_date: 2018-06-26 06:10:06
JFC. Look, you can't (pretend to) not care about losing money when the times are tough, and then talk about Lambos and "it's over 9000" when it's on the upswing again.  You can't have it both ways it makes you look like a child. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 06:47:03
LOL what? You realise "buy low" could appply to literally every single investable asset?
@_date: 2018-06-27 06:55:56
Haha. Ok whatever you say. Let me guess you're about 18-20 years old, literally never invested in any stock before, and you live in the crypto bubble. Because of course "buy low sell high" can only apply to crypto. Jesus christ there are so many kids in this subreddit.
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:12:33
You know, this was only 10 years ago, and I don't know about others but my memory from 10 years ago isn't hazy. I distinctly remember many people being tried and convicted as a result of the crash. Scapegoated? Probably. But the statement "NOBODY went to jail for '08" is utter bullshit.
@_date: 2019-01-03 03:11:54
LOL enjoy the self delusion OP
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:13:41
yeah, you're right. But NOBODY (all caps is OP) is not the same as "a handful"
@_date: 2019-01-03 11:38:08
No the delusion lies in the fact that people keep reaching further for straws looking for indicators that BTC isn't fucked. This is a perfect example of this. Watch when yearly lows will go down in a few months, then come back to this post and let's talk again.
@_date: 2019-01-09 17:50:10
Shitposting isn't going to change the value, I'm afraid.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:48:18
If I would buy every time I puked on my shoes.....I'd be the opposite of REKT.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:45:54
How do you do, fellow cryptokids?
@_date: 2018-07-16 23:18:17
Fuck me how gaudy and ostentatious. You can't buy class, not even with BTC.
Goes for this subreddit as a whole. Drooling over the most tacky displays of wealth. Have to wonder what's the average age here.
@_date: 2018-07-16 23:19:15
I don't think you get what a LPT is.
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:30:37
Well, I don't mean to tell the obvious but the idea is you're investing in a better society/planet. Or are people dumb enough to not understand the point behind charity?
@_date: 2018-07-11 13:59:47
I understand that not everyone in this sub is necessarily proficient at investing (nor should that need to be the case), but come on. You know damn well that not only value but also trend is what matters when making a buy/hold/sell decision. It's not rocket science.
You replace "Bitcoin" with AAPL in the above scenario and you know anyone with half a brain would agree with it.
