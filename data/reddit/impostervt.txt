What's interesting is they don't ever actually have to own bitcoin to buy and sell bitcoin futures.

Sounds a lot like Ripple?  Looks like they got funding from Stripe to the tune of $3mill.

If you want bitcoins quickly, you're going to pay a large markup.

Is this what you mean?

A friend and I were discussing making something like this, but came back to the question, "How does Bitcoin make this any easier than if we just used dollars?"

I like the "flipping a coin" analogy.  Sometimes the numbers involved in bitcoin/cryptography are so big they can be difficult to explain to a non-techie.

Looks good, but how will you combat chargeback fraud?

It's a huge step towards making Bitcoin attractive to merchants.

I was running the numbers this morning and it looked like you could get  5-6% rate of return after fees were taken into effect. Fees include wire transfer to bitstamp (~$45 + .01%), purchasing on bitstamp (0.46%), sell on mtgox (0.6%), transfer to japanese bank account (~$2.5), wire transfer back to bitstamp ($45 + .01%).  Turn around time be about 5 days (if nothing goes wrong, and I realize something always goes wrong)...

I've used btcQuick and liked it. How do you plan to improve on it?

Damn. I have high hopes for Ziggap, but their funding methods keep changing (was western union/money market, now is zipzap, same as bitinstant), and they seem to go through downtime a lot (but less than coinbase or bitinstant).

I didn't see them mentioned on the Bitcoin Foundation website...

Alternately, you can use Electrum or Multibit. These are "light-weight" clients that run on your machine but don't download the entire block chain.
I strongly recommend you don't keep all of your bitcoins in any one place.

I was just thinking about this recently. The weird state that MtGox is in, with an unnaturally larger price compared to other exchanges, makes arbitrage more attractive right now - if you can find a way to get your money out of Mt. Gox.  All you need is a Japanese bank account...
