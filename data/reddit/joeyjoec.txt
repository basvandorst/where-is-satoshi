Nice spam account.

I'm pretty sure I have at least 5 scattered about back in the days when it was $1 a coin. I used to play on all of the gambling sites. I used to run one too. I just don't remember which and many have probably swallowed up my bitcoin by now. I have 0.189 in the wallets I managed to find though!
This post made me go through all of my previous bitcointalk posts, the one that hurts was when I found out I won 40.5btc in the bitlotto, now worth $670,000. I sold it for like £400. I also had 0.68 in a mining pool that screwed everyone over.

Can confirm, sold off 40.5btc some years ago for ~$600 after winning bitlotto.

I still have 0.2 so I have that going for me!

I closed the app, replaced the file then started it up, it then automatically rescans.
Edit: I've ran the bitcoind.exe, and tried using dumpprivkey, but it's asking for the address. How do I get the address from a wallet.dat file?
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:26:47
But I can't open it without it rescanning. Is there another way?
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:16:32
I had no luck with that at all. How do I get the private key from a wallet.dat?
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:41:31
The balance is 0 in the end, but the transactions are quite recent. It's very odd!
By the way, I have been using listaddressgroupings to get an entire list of addresses, then dumping the key, then importing into another app, but it's taking forever since I have so many wallets. Do I have to do it this way or is there another way?

Many thanks. I think I have it working, but it looks like I've got someone elses wallet. I haven't used this wallet in years, but there are transactions as early as last month.

I would normally avoid but the feedback is very good. Can't find the username on any google searches either which suggests they don't scam.

I have terrible heating here so we often have to use an electric heater. Don't need to use it if I'm mining instead.

I got worried about the fact they may be able to reverse it in 3 months time and just went for a bank transfer which went through very fast. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:10:23
Thanks.

You use it as if it was a heater. Don't use it constantly. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:00:43
I simply just use my PC to mine when the heating is on. Heats up the house so technically isn't costing me any extra.

So I guess [this]( is a big no no?

... some people have dept, therefore wouldn't be able to afford them 6 years ago.

Looks like one of the accounts at least.  My sister just  got this. She runs a small company. Everything is as good as gone. Fuck.
