Not 3 months.


My 15,000 comments and almost never commenting on anything related to crypto say I can play that card.


I'd still have to have a look at the account. Go ahead and reply.


Longer age, number of comments, and how often they are found pushing something on a crypto sub are all things someone should look at, shill.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:24:27
@_date: 2018-09-14 20:14:30
Yada yada. A shill made something up, got called on it. Water is wet.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:16:50
I looked into it, meh.

That's not fiverr. That's blackhatworld. That's not $5. My account is worth hundreds. My account is a political mostly account it might be worth a $1000+ for account history all the way back to supporting Trump in the primaries. It would be extremely useful for shilling as I have a custom flair on T_D given to me by the top mod.
So, not $5 and not Fiverr. It's okay to be wrong. Your 3 month old account means nothing. Now comment with your real account that is equivalent to my account or you can just stop talking.
@_date: 2018-09-15 06:44:49

Yea, show me the fiverr account with 15,000 comments, 200k karma, and daily use for 2 1/2 years.


Yea, go show me.


There are plenty of people paying for shills. Are you seriously trying to say people aren't being paid to shill? You can't think people are *that* stupid.
Don't change the topic. Go find me that Fiverr account for sale. I want to see it.

@_date: 2018-09-14 19:24:27
Comment with your real account with the same stats or go buy one because they are so cheap and so many people can easily shill for $5.
Like I said, you are a shill, you don't have account history, you can't get an account with history easily, and it's obvious you got roasted.

You are the definition of a salty cuck who is never going to get over the fact that you didn't hodl bitcoin. Fade into misery.
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:17:39
You are a guy who doesn't hold bitcoin and is pulling out your hair trying to rationalize this bull run. Welp, you're a dummy for not holding bitcoin and you only have yourself to blame. Get over it. Go cry somewhere else.

No you didn't. Quit being embarrassed on the internet.
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:23:02
Yawn. What a loser. I bet you thought you sold the high at like 3400 and are pulling your hair out right now. You will be like the millions of losers who sold before you and cried about how it was overpriced and how a crash was totally coming.
What a dummy.
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:32:18
As soon as I start seeing these posts bitcoin takes a dive. One week and bitcoin will drop below 7k. Watch.
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:36:04
This same post happen at the 9-8k crash, 8-7k crash, and now the 7-6k crash. It will happen at the 6-5k crash too. The tech is not worth the value. The speculative value is gone. Now it will return to actual value and needs to put up tech or shut up.
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:12:21
To where it was? Nope. Never again. It will eventually drop to 5k or even lower. The global elite got involved a while ago and as soon as you saw their mouthpieces in hollywood promoting bitcoin you should have known it was going to be pumped and dumped. Right now they are fleecing everyone. They are going to pump and dump over and over and over and will end up on top each time. They probably already control the majority of ever single coin that is not owned by the dev team. You can still make money but you won't make 2-3x off any of the top coins ever again.
You just have to understand that as soon as the big bang theory made an episode they already had control. This is the banks technology now. Literally every bank shill on the news is saying it's gonna be worth 100k eventually. That's because they are shilling it for their masters who are unloading the worthless coin they pumped with their billions. Once they decide to stop pumping all the people who bought will panic sell and they will scoop everything or just decide not to rebuy and make crypto worthless. The price in the first bubble in 2013 was actually driven by one guy. If you go back and look into it there was an article on it.
Crypto is done. They won.
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:01:42
:) Me and you were right.
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:32:27
I also predicted the crash down to 5800 and rebound. :) To me, it seems so obvious.

Which is why I am sure it's going to 5000. All the comments are roasting how dumb OP is and how he can't do basic math but the post is brigade upvoted. Whales are still trying to cash more out before it drops even further.

Ya jinxed it ya dolt!
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:56:06
Nah, correct play would be to cash out enough to pay off the house loan and let the rest ride. Bitcoin wasn't going to collapse but he might lose some of his gains.

@_date: 2017-11-02 15:48:30
Not my place but if you wanna hear my opinion, 2020 is arbitrary. You should pick an amount that you will cash out at. And even then leave a little in bitcoin incase they end up being worth 100k each. Some people use the ol' 2.5 mil marker because you can live the rest of your life with fuck you money at that point. Another option is to keep adding. You know if you add another 50k and it doubles, hey you got there even faster.
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:06:10
Oh look, below 4k again. You hodlers are funny.

Could you be any more delusional? France is being destroyed by this one world government open borders bullshit. They were going to step on the throats of the people with the gas tax. If you really want the opposing side to stay in power you are about as clueless as they come. How about you stop thinking the people demonized by the media are bad people for wanting to protect the FRENCH. Before long there will be no French left in France. I bet you aren't even french.

Looks like the colleges raise the price of college in response to more funding. It's well documented. Giving more money to colleges is about the stupidest thing in the world. How about instead the government passes some laws to make the price gouging stop since their profits are sky high. You idiot liberals always have the dumbest fucking solutions. You think money grows on trees. How about we pass laws to make them stop buying up smaller colleges to get monopolies in areas where your choices are limited? A company whose main expense is teachers who they underpay doesn't need more fucking money. How about we pass laws that they cannot make money off boarding or books? How about we pass laws that they have to get you into a job with your degree or you don't pay them. How about anything besides your fucking stupid ass opinion on how to fix the real issue. You talk about us spending money in places that are useful but all of you scream Putin puppet if Trump wants to get us out of any of the wars that cost us 7 fucking trillion dollars.

This arguement is always the most hiliarous one that comes up. You are basically saying:


So you are saying to give up our protections because the government could use super weapons on us? Do you see how insane you sound? No. I bet you do not.


Welp, there it is. Give up your guns because predator drones will get you. "Be completely defenseless because if you have guns you will be a target. Also, trust the government by giving up your guns." Do you fools sit in echo chambers and talk this stuff out without any input? How can you not see how stupid this sounds?

What the fuck does that have to do with what you said and my response? Your education clearly didn't teach you how to read.


Hey guess what? With my extra money from lower taxes I get to choose where it goes. Based on the tax brackets I see I could go to college and pay for all my healthcare and then some with the savings over your tax brackets.


Apparently no one on the left supports this right now in my country. They think we should keep fighting endless wars that destroy countries. At least you aren't so stupid you change your stance on war just because "muh orange man bad."

Literally don't care. We just want the wall and I would be okay with any means necessary to get it. This is a democracy. He promised he would get a wall and the cucks in the senate would not let it happen. That's not on him. He has placed tariffs on mexico and made them renegotiate trade deals.


Trump says he will get a wall and someone else blocks him and then you complain about him not following through? You people are delusional. He has done everything in his power outside of crashing the stock market with a revolution for it. You are a fool who supports 8 global wars. The first president in 20 years to pull us out of wars and the left is going insane over it.
You people are fucked in the head. Sorry not sorry. I do not like war. I like my guns. I like to pay lower taxes. I like businesses to pay lower taxes.

Betsy is not a god. Her position doesn't give her the authority needed to tell a company they cannot buy other companies or that they cannot charge for books. She can do a lot, has done a lot, and for that I am thankful. The left is brainwashed on her. She changed the policy that allowed state run colleges to not give the accused a fair trial. This was huge and is a greatly needed change in our current college culture. But no, she cannot change what I proposed. She can only affect government controlled colleges. We would need congress and the senate to pass the laws that need changing. Also I did not bring up college because it was not why I voted for Trump. I voted for him because of jobs and the economy which he has done a stellar job with. No refund needed.

If you really think billionaires control the world and are the evil people please tell me why they donated to Hillary 20 to 1 vs Trump.

If you tether your Pro to your LG envy phone(Or any 2013 phone) that will boost the cores. All you have to do from there is log onto bitcoin.com with it running and you will get lightbulbcoins. Every 6 light bulbs convert to a bit once you smash them together using a coin tumbler. These bits are bit "coins" The smashed lightbulb glass ferments the filaments into coins with enough pressure. You are able to apply pressure by pressing and holding Alt-F4 while tumbling bulbs.
If you press Alt-F4 right now while on bitcoin.com it will pull up a quick cheat sheet explaining everything with pictures to make it easier.

If you *need* that to be able to wake up and that is the only possible way, then yes. Because he phrased it as if it was the only possible way to relax naturally and that the Trumps must do unnatural stuff to kick back. If you can't take a cold shower instead and the only way possible for you to wake up is for you to have coffee then you have a problem. It's not the same level of problem as needing alcohol to relax though. I see what point you are trying to make but it's pedantic. Helping yourself wake up with coffee is hardly the same as needing drugs and alcohol to be able to have fun and relax. That's like comparing a meth user to a coffee drinker because they both use them to wake up. It's pedantic.

And then will sell off for all that profit they made buying your $2300 coins. You missed this wave but if you think bitcoin will go to $5000 by all means invest. If you think short term it will not go down from here you are gambling. It could fluctuate quite a bit.

@_date: 2017-05-28 03:50:45
That was level 2 of the hold. 
1 = 2000 a mental barrier.
2 = 1850 a spot with lots of support. We bounced off this.
3 = 1150 a spot with the most support
below that, crashing to 500-600 easily. This would happen if the USA suddenly said they were going to make BTC illegal.

I don't think you understand miners. They are doing this for money, not because they believe in crypto. They jump around from crypto to crypto, from pool to pool, mining whatever makes them the most money.
Do you know how much money could be made by shorting the market and the reneging on BIP-91? The market would tank, they could use options to quadruple their holdings in a couple days if they all worked together.
@_date: 2017-07-11 04:47:59

"Christ you are the moron." The question did not state $2521 "more" it said pick one or the other. You added "more" to try and strawman to make your arguement. It didn't work. You were either trying to strawman the argument or are are not very intelligent.
You have money and you can choose either to keep fiat or 1 btc. It does not say they are free and they will be added to your account and you should pick which one of these free things you are going to get. The question is posed as a discussion point for the sub about how people either think the price is going to decline or rise and whether or not it is worth it to take the cheap bitcoin or cash out. You missed the purpose of the discussion completely because you are a dense mothafucka. He even says it under the post:


He isn't asking about magic fairies showing up to gift you one or the other and which one you would like to be gifted more you fool. He is asking which you would pick with your own current money and how you personally value it. You are so dumb, for real.

I mocked people for not selling at 10k, 8k, 6k, 4k, and now 3k. You have lost money even if you haven't sold. You people who have lost all repeat the same lines:
* You don't lose till you sell
* HODL MEMES!!!!
* Bitcoin is going to 100k!!!
None of it is true and even if bitcoin is going to 100k anyone can literally buy back in between now and the top and make a higher ROI than you.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:41:39
Bitcoin would have to be the world's reserve currency for your statement to make any sense.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:46:14
It's relevant because it only matters what the casuals think. And the casuals will only hear that it's the biggest coin now. All the causal money will go to ETH. All the price pumping because of casuals will go to ETH. And in the end the miners lose out on all the money their BTC would have earned because they couldn't come to an agreement with the community.
So, if they don't start working together in a month from now bitcoin won't just be the 2nd market cap coin, it might be 2nd and 10 billion behind. It also might happen this week. ETH has closed the gap 20% in one day...
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:47:15

Yea, I put my money where my mouth was and sold ages ago and didn't buy back in all year. To the people who threw away all that profit being greedy and thinking they were gonna 20x again: You are delusional, you deserve your losses, and next time don't be so greedy. Btw, we are going to 2200 which was the old support level way back when.

See my comment history. I own both because I'm not an idiot. I just scolded someone for not owning any bitcoin at all in their portfolio. This might be hard to understand but not everyone who is telling you that bitcoin is throwing away it's golden opportunity is a eth shill. I own both. I will always own both. Bitcoin is still throwing away the chance it had to be the world currency. August 1st might be too late. People might not care. I have seen other cryptos crash in a day. If the flippening starts it will not stop...
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:26:32
sure, it just crashed $80 today, it'll crash just like bitcoin crashes from every all time high. When it crashes it still might be higher than bitcoin since the crypto market seems to crash together...
As it stands ETH is the only coin of value that is up today in the market...

That would make sense if bitcoin was the world's most valuable brand. But as soon as another crypto is number 1 things change. This isn't apple vs all of android. This is more like apple vs one particular phone.
