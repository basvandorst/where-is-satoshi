I understand what you mean. The point is was trying to make was more that those version naming schemes are to be taken with a grain of salt, and I for one take the project more seriously if they are more conservative with their release of a 1.0. Many projects get released these days which is stated by the developers to be 1.0 but is riddled with bugs.
One thing that I'd like to correct you on is that you seem to be saying that c-lightning, lnd, and eclair are lightning wallets. While in the end I think you're right as they do include command line interface wallets, in my eyes their most important feature is being Lightning Nodes, and other parts of the community are developing wallets for them, or other projects within the same company. I know ACINQ and Lightning Labs have people developing lightning wallet apps in addition to the nodes, but I don't know if there is one corresponding accordingly to c-lightning in Blockstream. Zap wallet for instance is a separate entity AFAIK, and Electrum seem to be developing lightning wallet support.

GMO Internet, the Japanese firm making those new ASIC miners are working on one integration platform: [

lnd being at 0.42 and c-lightning being at 0.6 really doesn't indicate anything on how far along they are relative to each other, it's really just up to the devs of the project how they decide to name their releases. Proper open source projects are notorious for never reaching 1.0 so don't hold your breath for that, and also remember that it will be more than usable before reaching 1.0. Bitcoin Core is 10 years old now and still isn't on 1.0.

One thing that we're really waiting for which would sort of enable end users to use it now without running their own node is watchtowers, which I think the lnd guys said they're working on for their next release. Hard to know exactly when that will come though, and after that has been released then wallets will need to implement.
C-Lightning I think are working on it too but I don't know if they have an actual release schedule or anything either. ACINQ I have no clue.
The thing is from what I can gather is that this proposed eltoo thing kind of makes watchtowers obsolete, so there might be an incentive to hold back on developing watchtowers because of that, but again I'm not sure on this I'm just speculating. The functionality might be good to implement now anyways and may serve some purpose even with eltoo.
For eltoo to be implemented is probably going to take really long however, because (although the change is quite minor) it requires an update to the base level bitcoin protocol, which can be done as a soft fork, and soft forks although being less controversial than hard forks are still a big deal and it's probably going to take some time getting everyone to agree on implementations and finally getting everyone running compatible nodes. 95% of all nodes need to signal or am I mistaken? Anyways, for that reason maybe more than one change will be implemented and bundled into one soft fork, like Schnorr, so there might be reasons for postponing a soft fork until enough is ready to be worth the effort. Like it's been pointed out by others LN is already ok to use, but watchtowers and eltoo, and updates to routing etc will incrementally make it better. The new Zap wallet is looking pretty neat eh, so things are definitely happening.
Please correct me if I'm wrong on anything here.

How is that predetermined amount of blocks enforced? In the end, can't a malicious user just sign a new tx and submit it to the block chain? Or rather just submit an old state tx to the blockchain directly?

In this case that line would be the same line leading up to the current uptrend (or whatever the terminology is). Like this is just a dip like those small ones before December. So what I'm trying to say is you don't need to wait 10 years in sideways price movement.

Why not?

Are LApps L3? Kind of? Since they're running on L2 if you will

Obviously it's a good thing and there will still be good block rewards without many tx required for some time anyways so don't worry over the miners. Plus, wouldn't 3rd level potentially further lower the need for on chain tx?
