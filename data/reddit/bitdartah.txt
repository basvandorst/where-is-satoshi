It is extremely unlikely that "Bitcoin 2.0" will be completely separate/unique from the original Bitcoin. If a new cryptocurrency could completely usurp Bitcoin willy-nilly, then no cryptocurrency will ever succeed because users would never be able to put their full confidence behind it. Bitcoin is meant to grow with technology, albeit patiently. 
Alt-currencies are excellent "beta testing" environments for new technologies that may eventually be incorporated into the original Bitcoin, but they cannot simply replace Bitcoin entirely without also destroying confidence in cryptocurrencies as a whole. It's Bitcoin's steady, long-term rise that makes it powerful.

Let's be honest: some people will find some fiat price point too tempting and will sell their BTC.  For those of us who understand the underlying value of BTC and also understand the sinking ship of fiat, there is no reason to ever exchange back to fiat. 
This is a one-way journey for me.  If there are goods and services I need, I will use BTC.

Marc Andreessen is one of the Reddit investors. I'm pretty sure Reddit will just be using Colored Bitcoins or something similar that utilizes Bitcoin.

I'd be happier if it held for the next 5 years around $5k with deep order books. And you know what? I still wouldn't want your fiat at that price (or any price). My only interest in a higher spot price is that the economy will draw-in new users.

The only thing that will stop war is to DEMAND that all governments and rulers be put out to pasture. As a whole, a truly free market would never want anything but peace.
Bitcoin is perhaps one piece of the puzzle.

TraderSteve, great video! What regulations are you being required to follow in CA?

Look, bro, as someone who has made the same mistakes as you, I want you to know that there is only redemption in this: don't try to play the markets, don't try to time the markets, and don't try to study trends. I have personally seen thousands of BTC turn to hundreds. You have two options:
1) If you are truly long on Bitcoin, hold strong. Take your BTC out of every exchange and put them away securely. You have won. Do not look back. Do not endlessly check the BTC/fiat price. Bitcoin will still change the world.
2) Cut all your losses and keep all your money in fiat. Confess your mistakes to your family. You have won by learning a difficult lesson.
Tl;Dr: Don't think for one second that you could have done things differently. If you are long, take your BTC out of every exchange. If you are short, take your fiat out of every exchange.

It's cheaper to use because... 
1) Lower risk of fraud (no charge-backs)
2) Uses the internet as its backbone (fast)
3) Very low fees regardless of transaction size (see above)

It is funny that men in power do not understand that action and reaction are equal and opposite, that when you persecute people you always rouse them to be strong and stronger. Satoshi was born as a response to the greed of men in power.

How about "Decentralized" instead of "Anonymity"?

Many people will not resist exchanging their pure, unsullied money for worthless fiat-- but there are those of us who are on this journey for all-or-nothing, for the complete revolution and liberation of our financial system, or nothing but a stepping stone to getting there.

The only reason we were in the 2008 bubble or any past bubble since the Fed was created was because of the crap the Fed has been doing. 
They've successfully delayed the inevitable? Great. See you at the next bubble.

One thing is for sure, alternatives to Coinbase within the USA and throughout the world is still a good thing-- assuming they can build a user base.

The earliest miners knew Bitcoin wasn't worthless.

Honestly, distractions like this rubbish altcoin are annoying, but at least they make others aware of *something* else. Let's be real though, unlike Bitcoin, Nautiluscoin has no real chance in the global system.

Why does the private key even need to be displayed?

Dude, I'll give you $5k in 3 years if Bitcoin drops to 0. Quit messing around. Bitcoin is the gold standard even if most of the guys on this forum are hedging-crazed wimps and can't appreciate that.

Feel free to diversify, but when you really believe in something, you give it as much as you're willing to lose. In my case, that's almost everything.

Uhh, Bitcoin doesn't care. It is and always will be a stake in the heart of those trying to wield it. It's libertarian and anarchistic roots are unavoidable.

I think you misunderstand: Bitcoin is proof that large, centralized governments are not needed.

Bitcoin's don't give a damn what mines them, as long as they do it faster than the next guy. If it works, it works.
