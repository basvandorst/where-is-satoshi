I agree with the functionality of android, but you can use android apps on the BB OS as well now.

I think the only reason they got my exchange account is by doing a password change and I never used it. Not even once but they sure as fuck got into my email. Pretty shitty.

Im not trying to get him to invest, rather just accept the fact that BTC is not a Fad as he so fervently refers to it. i know that even if I did help him reach the conclusion that its not a fad I know that I have no sway with how he invests his money. I just like to bring it up with him as much as possible because he works closely with major high-tech companies world wide and works in the securities industry both physical and IT.  I figure its good exposure because I know he talks about quite a bit with his colleagues as he tells me their opinions on it as well.

Someone sure doesnt care. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:23:56
Thats what I figured. Im not really worried about it myself. But trying to get my dad involved is like trying to punch your way out of steel box. All he cares about or mentions how unstable the prices are. He refuses to look past anything else even with evidence of it lasting power right in front of his face.

Wow. You seem to harbor a lot of hate towards them. I dont think they will be dying anytime soon. Ford is in talks with implementing the QNX OS in all of their in-dash navigation/media.

Is that the dogecoin halving happening in the background?
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:02:10
I see. I wasn't aware of that. So he could have taken the majority of their assets by now anyways and legally at that.  The only thing im not quite sure of is; how would GOX turn themselves into a ponzi scheme?  Or am I confusing ponzi with a pyramid scheme? It just seems like outright embezzlement and theft. 
Edit: also, what does "IANAL" mean?

Quick question,  if I want to withdraw from change tip bot will it transfer straight to a bitcoin wallet or is there an extra step?
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:54:41
I haven't logged onto coinbase in months. Idling think the last time I logged into my coinbase account in December. 
So somehow I feel like that is unlikely  that  the day there is list released withh all user information that I get hacked. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:54:22
I will. Thank you. I have my coins all in cold storage offline. And use a different device to fiddle with my coins. I need to be more careful tho. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:04:49
I dont know. I was asking you. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 03:49:13
I would love to recieved it but alas I dont feel I deserve it. I dont have any myself except for the very minimal/and un transferable amount ive recieved for my karma. I just simply have no disposable income to invest in bit coin at the moment.  Until I can fix my car and get my as about to north Dakota to work in the oil fields. 
All that aside, I think you should just hang onto it. Or maybe buy other coins with it and try going from there. I enjoy just watching the markets. I have 3$ in Devon and its turned into 6$ lol. Its fun just to see where its going and watching how emotionally affected the market is. 
If you dont want to hold onto it or exchange it to USD/EUR I would suggest buying something with it online. There are plenty of awesome products or services to be bought with you coin. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:16:23
Well I always tip generously at restaurants but no I dont. Point made. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:22:03
Fuck. Well I'm on mobile ATM and there is nothing linked to my mobile concerning my coins. So I should be ok, right?
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:14:15
Wow. Real stand up operation they have going on there. 
Why would they deliberately want to destroy their own company? To walk away with every coin in their exchange?
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:38:13
Yea, if they really were planning on walking away with the money they should act like nothing is wrong and just dissapear.  I guess they could be trying to file for bankruptcy but im not sure how Japanese laws are on bankruptcy so they might actually have to drive it to the ground themselves I guess. The only thing im wondering is even if they did file for bankruptcy wouldnt there be some sort of investigation? 
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:20:50
That is really a good idea. I think Doge is trying to get behind some sort of sponsorship during the world cup. With the Olympics exposure and making so many headlines lately their community is really starting to take off. It seems tho that BTC is in the news quite regularly but I know that most people who aren't already into cryptos hardly register the mentions it recieved. I always notice but I've literally been right next to someone when mention of BTC hits the news and its like they didn't even register what they heard/saw when I ask them seconds afterwards
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:24:28
Oh look another way to lose my money!
@_date: 2014-04-02 09:01:32
I do except for that one exchange mostly because I never have used it. I just signed up there before I really knew what I was doing. But I changed that now. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:59:44
On the off chance that its not insolvent.....Damn thats tempting to buy in right now. Ive got nothing in Gox so im not worried one bit, but it sure is tempting to try get in on that...
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:50:24
Hey yall, im not very active here in btc. But without btc not a single other coin would exist or flourish. Bitcoin is the granddad of all coins and those who use other coins as speculation investments ultimately are gunning to get their piece of the btc pie. I hold amounts of about 12-15 other coins and I trade them all. I started here in btc. Came in after the peak on the downswing but still higher than our current cruising altitude. 
Ive seen a lot of "its the same $.25 being tipped back n forth. And a lot of it is, or even far less. But even if its a quarter being tossed around here n there, that shit adds up. Ive acquired probably $25-40 dollars worth of tips in the last few months of at doge. Some are larger tips $1-3 but most are thr 50-100 doge tips. 
Even thos ive been tipped that much ive probably tipped more. Its not about hoarding your tips, its to keep the folks happy. Some do inevitably hoard. It is money. But I am an investor so I keep very little of what I recieve. 
Nobody will ever complain about a tip. 
Also a lot of individuals host giveaways to promote their business or services and to reach a larger audience for mere pennies on the dollar. 
The tipping culture does not have to be about throwing money around. Its just a great way to keep the user base active and the community happy while doing your part to establish your currency. 
Long live bitcoin and long live the crypto-currency trade!
-happy investor, signing out. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:43:29
This is insanity! Im lost in the dark. Is this only a gox thing? Cuz I just checked and the price is like $160 how is that even possible? Im assuming something rather fucked is going on. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:35:48
Oh I fully understand that it is all about money and greed. We are dealing with real money here. And I know enough of how tge world turns not to take everything at face value. Thanks for the warning tho. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:05:09
If anyone is interested please let me know, if you have anything in mind specifically I have tens of thousands more of all shapes, colors and sizes just let me know some specifics and I can work on finding something suitable.

Are you offering me a bounty to try to hire the Yakuza?
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:47:18
I see, thanks for clearing that up. I can see now, it does seem highly likely they are trying exactly That. Which im not sure is illegal or not in Japan, but isnt it illegal at least in the US? if it is illegal there as well, then why not just take the money and run.  
@_date: 2014-04-02 10:30:34
Nope. Never do. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:09:15
Haha. Thanks. Unfortunately for me, I got my .2 BTC when it was around $850. Do you see this  current price as sort of the flat line right now or not?
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:04:19
I whole heartedly agree. Doge is unbelievable right now. Especially with the influx of 1000s of new subscribers. The begging is really starting to get annoying. But I think the begging will die down in a few weeks.
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:08:44
Could hire the Yakuza. They could pry help squeeze some money outta them. Although thats what you call a high risk operation. Or the Yakuza are the owners of GOX
EDIT: spelling, added a thought.
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:02:51
I do agree. I bought in on Doge. Simply because their growth is massive and impressive. Plus their community is extremely strong (albeit rather inexperienced and a little immature) that said it is fun to hit the recieving end of a 20,000 doge tip. There are plenty of knowledgeable folk over there as well. Ive been a lurker here for a little over 3 months now and always keep an eye on BTC and about a .2 btc in my wallet. I just have a hard time understanding the workings of all these coins. The Doge community has been very helpful in teaching me plenty so I've got a lot of respect for them. I just always felt rather stupid asking questions here. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:07:29
Hmm. Interesting. So  GOX is pretty much a cooked goose? I haven't paid a whole lot of attention to the GOX fiasco since ive never traded with them. But from what I understand is that they have been withholding everyone's coins by not allowing withdraw? 
@_date: 2014-04-02 10:33:32
Ok so if you get pickpocketed and the thief just leaves your wallet on the street. Who the fuck do you blame then?
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:12:28
Valid point. You seem to have a lot of hard feelings towards Doge. Why is that? It was all that long ago btc was in their shoes. And with the exposure they get I think they a potential for some serious growth. And the prices are extremely low allowing for huge investment opportunities with little risk. They are so new that I find it hard to believe they wont grow quite a bit over the next year.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:37:46
Good deal. Thanks for all your help. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:13:50
I'm not so much pressuring them to invest, but trying to get them to see that this isn't some bullshit fad and that eventually they will probably have to deal with it regardless of what thry think now.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:15:43
This, I have been doing. I mean, I've tried to GIVE them some btc and they just tell me its a scam. And when I pointed out that btc made the cover of time its mostly recieved by flippant remarks.  Its frustrating as hell.
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:51:06
I will. I'm not using large amounts of money right now anyways. Not much more than $100 so if I keep it in an exchange accnt and it gets lost I'm not going to die.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:16:46
I understand that coinbase isn't an exchange, I'm simply planning on using it as a means to deposit USD into my acct to purchase btc, then transfer said btc to an echange acct so I can invest in ltc, prime...etc.
CampBX..this sounds interesting. How did you get money/coins to this acct. I'm assuming thru coinbase? 
One last thing on coinbase..did you do the instant verification?  And 4 days is an eternity!!!
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:45:54
Jeeeeeeeeeeeeebus. That went way over my head. Ill have to read it 5 -10 more times lol. Thank you for your imput tho. Its greatly appreciated.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:29:44
Sorry if there was confusion. I did not think you were affiliated. I was just venting. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:10:39
That's what I feared. Thank you anyways
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:41:51
Have a quick question about wallets...or a few questions
1) best place to get said wallet?
2) best way to make it safe? I know ABOUT offline and paper wallets but still a bit confused as to HOW they work. Maybe if someone could ELI5.
3) which password for a wallet is private, which is public? THIS is my biggest question. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:19:48

You sire, are a god amoung men. I just saw you mentioned in an exchanges news article that I'm subscribed to.

Issues such as what? Does bitstamp allow USD deposits? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:09:05
I can't even create a damn account there. It keeps giving me some bullshit. God this is pissing me off
