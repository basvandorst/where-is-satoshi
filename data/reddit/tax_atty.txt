DO NOT DO THIS.

Well, if the donee doesn't bother to ask or have any evidence at all as to the cost basis, then donee would be forced to use a 0 cost basis.
This is actually a really interesting question if you consider the case of anonymous donors gifting Andreas Antonopoulos multiple BTC. Andreas wouldn't report any income with respect to receiving the btc but he will likely need to recognize 100% of the ultimate exchange for fiat because he has no evidence as to basis. This gets even more interesting from a money laundering standpoint--i.e. "anonymous gifts" made to yourself.

Great question. Technically, a conversion such as 0.99 is required, however, consistency is key in tax reporting. Even if your method is incorrect, be consistent! 
To answer your question, your amount realized is $7920 USD (8000*0.99USDT), your cost basis is what you paid, $7000. Your realized gain is $920.

USA: To answer your question, section 1015(a) of the IRC provides that the donee's basis in the propery received is the donors basis, unless the property is sold for a loss and the fair market value of the property is less than the donor's basis at the time of the gift.
Any gain realized and recognized by the donee (if any) on a sale or exchange is the donee's not the donor's.

For tax purposes, USDT is treated as a commodity (or property). USDT and cryptocurrencies, in general, are not treated as USD or as foreign currencies.
