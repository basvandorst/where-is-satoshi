If if makes anyone feel better I lost several million dollars when I sold my company , was paid in shares, there's was lock in period and some dodgy dealing and the new owners went bankrupt before I could cash out.. Plus they put more than 50 hard working staff members out of work without there last pay check ( they walking in on pay day and told everyone to leave)..
You get over it.. It makes you stronger..
