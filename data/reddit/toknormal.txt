This is wrong. You haven't thought this though at all.
Bitcoin should not pander to monopolists.
The 51% threat MUST remain in place as an important cornerstone of it's decentralised nature. GHash.io need to realise that if they want to grow then they picked the wrong industry sector.
What needs to be done here is exactly NOTHING. It isn't a question of "people being nice". It's a question of removing the incentive for growth of mining pools.
By addressing the problem with a technical solution you're putting that incentive back in place.
GHash.io now have a problem - they can't grow - and they're wanting the Bitcoin foundation to solve it for them so they can continue to grow. Don't give in to them.
This whole scenario needs to be allowed to play itself out so that mining pools naturally start to dissipate due to lack of incentive caused by the glass ceiling on growth. No technical modification is needed to address the 51% problem because the solution is already built into the Bitcoin economy and Peter Todd has already demonstrated that.
Again, GHash.io need to realise that this is not a sector that businesses can "grow" past a certain size because once they approach the 51% mining monopoly, the Bitcoin economy will start to devalue in its entirety causing them to be stuck in a catch 22 situation.
People don't seem to have thought this through. What would a technical solution do ?
[1] - it would remove the economic inhibitor to mining pool growth
[2] - give the green light to mining pools that wanted to grow past the 51% level
How is this possibly in the interests of Bitcoin users ? The answer is it isn't. It's purely in the interests of mining pool businesses.
Leave things exactly as they are.
It will be a problem for a while and then it will never return again as pools realise that this is an industry sector with anti-monopoly mechanisms already built in and their ambitions for growth won't be pandered to.
I for one am more than prepared to allow the price to sink for a while to allow this these mechanisms to play themselves out.

It won't 'fix the 51% vulnerability" morons. It will cement it in place for ever and open Bitcoin up to 100% vulnerability. Don't you see ?
The 51% vulnerability is currently fixed. What happens when we approach 51 % ? GHash has to do something about it, otherwise their business model goes down the pan and they start to lose money. On the other hand, if they think they can safely grow past 51% then they WILL DO THAT. You'll have huge mining monopolies. So what if they can't double spend the next block - the prospect of 75% and maybe 90% mining monopolies will be far worse than a 51% monopoly where the worst they can do is double spend the next block. Get real and think about this - do NOT implement a technical fix for the 51%.

In my view that is a fairly simplistic and ultimately baseless appraisal of the merits of sidechains vs alt-coins. Markets drive diversification as they see fit - whether that be of the technology or the ledgers themselves.
For example, one of the problems with "alternative protocols for updating the World Wide Ledger" is that they are only alternative protocols, not alternative assets. This is a major limitation because while it introduces an attractive technical diversity in terms of commercial interfaces, it is potentially far too chaotic economically to be of any use as a financial medium.
The inability of distinct sidechains to be independently valued by markets means that volatility is transmitted all over the place into commercial sectors where it didn’t originate, while the fungibility of bitcoin itself is basically blown to pieces (quite literally). At the same time, sidechains don’t do anything to mitigate the fragmentation of the cryptocurrency economy since that is an open economy, not a closed one, and alt-coins can still popup in any area in response to commercial demand.
It isn’t at all clear from here how things will progress, but markets are unlikely to ditch genuine diversity in favour of pseudo diversity no matter how well established bitcoin gets as the cryptocurrency “reserve”.

(Re. "Greg's Reply"):
That is a very long winded way to address what is essentially a strategic argument and not a technical one. i.e.
Should a cryptocurrency oriented financial system evolve:
[a] - vertically, as a single-currency backed technology chain of trust
[b] - horizontally, as a multi-currency economy where markets elect cryptocurrencies appropriate to their own sectors
Also, IMO Mike Hearn was not alluding to the authority of the Satoshi model but rather its consistency. GMaxwell could at least acknowledge that he has challenged this consistency by puncturing both bitcoin’s fungibility (by promoting a technology that recasts segments of the money supply with a distinguishable identity) and its mobility (by paralysing sections of the money supply while so recast). These are two acknowledged, centuries-old, properties of money and not ones to be dismissed lightly. 
Returning to the strategic bullet points above, nowhere are these two alternatives better expressed IMO than in the contrasting dialogs of Adam Back and Andreas Antonolpolis - (a programmer’s view VS a sociological view).
18 months ago, Adam Back - in a Lets Talk Bitcoin Interview - expressed in a few seconds, the sentiment that has since characterised the subtext of all of GMaxwell’s presentations, the formation of Blockstream and his perspective on the bitcoin blocksize debate. I think it would be instructive therefore for anyone to listen to this interview again.
Go to minute: 42;48
What Adam Back said was this:
 &gt;*Bitcoin was a kind of one-off event, the creation of a new concept of digital virtual scarcity, so it really is a kind of digital gold*.
He goes on to say that...


In other words - “we need to keep adding scaffolding to Bitcoin to maintain the illusion of a one-off monetary event, otherwise it will look like it’s reproducible and the value will go out of it”.
This is a fundamentally naive and flawed view in my opinion. For a start - bitcoin IS reproducible, whatever amount of scaffolding is added. Value will be engendered by the public according to their diverse priorities, not by programmers.
Secondly, even if it wasn’t, this is a huge strategic supposition on the back of which massive amounts of development effort have since been expended but for which Adam Back offered little historical, economic or sociological evidence whatsoever. If he had, he would have found that a programmer’s “mindset” favours conformity whereas the consumer’s “mindset” favours diversity. That "strategic blindness" reflects a recurring phenomenon in the industry where implementors are least best placed to make strategic judgements such as this.
If you need any more convincing that cryptocurrency is more than just a “a one-off event”, then contrast Adam Back’s testimony with that of Andreas Antonopolis in this clip of his presentation to the Canadian Senate: 
What’s at stake here is the vision for a free financial economy.
I used to subscribe to the view that Bitcoin should act as a base monetary store of value and allow the superstructure to do the “currency” bit. But I don’t any more because thats how money works today. It isn’t how a cryptocurrency-based economy will or should work. The Satoshi model was based on gold and it is what it is. Its consistency needs to be conserved, consolidated, and allowed to work within a wider hybrid economy (as Gold did not ‘change its spots’ despite the discovery of other metals). I now understand why Gavin says he wants ”as many people as possible to use bitcoin”. It’s because he sees it as complete technologically but incomplete sociologically and the latter is where the growth is going to come from from now on.

Dash is not "snake oil", neither in economic terms nor technological ones and the only people who use that term are those with something to loose from its being acknowledged as finding some deep rooted, lasting solutions to shortfalls in bitcoin.
For a start, it achieves privacy by *enhancing* fungibility, not by diminishing it (as sidechains do) nor by obscuring it (as Cryptonote does). That fact right there blows away your "snake oil' nonsense. Secondly, there is no reasonable definition of "centralised" that can apply to a network of over 3000 masternodes, each as logically redundant as a regular node and configurable anywhere, anytime by any user on on most anyplatform.
It's a bit surreal reading this thread and seeing the elephant in the room grow ever bigger. "Privacy baked into the blockchain", really ? How exactly does anyone propose to do that while retaining the monetary properties that gave bitcoin its original viability as a new monetary medium ? There isn't one single proposal on this page that addresses that challenge directly, nor is there in the entire cryptocurrency space, other than the one you appear to be intent on rubbishing. The reason there isn't is because, at one extreme you've got globalist monetary thinkers who's entire range of technical options is restricted by their obsession that bitcoin should be the only cryptocurrency in existence. At the other extreme you've got equally obsessive cryptographic trainspotters who think that the value derives from privacy (the reverse is of course the case) and that therefore we have to effectively bury the whole blockchain from view.
I'll keep my eyes open for a more enlightened and balanced view but I'm not holding my breath. In the meantime, forgive me if I don't buy the 'snake oil' perspective that your pushing  ;)

And yet it is - for the reason that it works damn well, implements multiple redundancy, anonymises pre-emptively and therefore supports all of the transaction auditing and infrastructure features that bitcoin does.

I think you're mixing up technical concepts with economic ones. Many of the solutions dreamed up by blockstream make sense at a technical level but not at an economic level. One is useless without the other. For example the idea of sidechains addresses the need for technological diversification. But what does it do economically ?
 • It implements a system of pegged currencies which is economically disastrous for such a diversified (not to mention evolving) market. (Think
 • it drives a coach and horses through the concept of fungibility by making entire sections of the coin supply distinguishable from each other
What about scaling ? Here we have another solution which leaves much to be desired in terms of "economic literacy".
 • as I've opined in other posts, the need for scaling is "on-chain" since all "off-chain" networks do is generate more traffic for the settlement layer to clear. Doesn't matter if they're trustless, trusted, natively denominated or other currency denominated
 • they don't appear to properly appreciate the distinction between a trade-clearing function (e.g. POS) and a payment system. The scaling solution proposed for bitcoin fulfils the former in terms of performance but not in any of the other ways that merchants require and are served by existing services (e.g. merchant support and in particular currency agnosticism)
The personnel that populate core originate in coding environments and technology backgrounds. They see things from that perspective - for example they see bitcoin as a "standard" and want to evolve it as such. But it is not a standard, it is a digital asset and therefore subject to competition from other digital assets. Investors necessarily prioritise diversification as being important for all sorts of reasons - i.e. exactly in opposition to many of the assumptions that "core" have made about bitcoin's economic context.

*But if at any point we have to decide between allowing more users / cheaper transactions and censorship resistance, the latter will always win*
 you make a very dangerous assumption that these two objectives are necessarily in conflict. Bitcoin no longer has a monopoly in the "decentralised digital asset" space so that changes all the arguments and priorities that held water before. For example, you can no longer argue that high transaction fees for native transaction clearing are sustainable since users now have a choice that goes beyond the modes of use of the bitcoin network itself.
Returning to you original point that...... *Bitcoin is extremely inefficient compared to stuff like VISA...But there's a reason for that, which is decentralization or censorship resistance*....this point is similarly wide of the mark. The more specific answer is that Bitcoin is simply not a POS system - it has nothing to do with being "decentralised". POS systems such as ERP's, eCommerce and PDQ machines have the job of clearing a trade in a particular vendor context. They are capable of doing this regardless of the collateral that backed that trade or the ultimate settlement layer that is impacted.
As such, you've just argued yourself into a corner by making this comparison because there happens to be an increasing number of such "derivative layer" transactions (i.e bitcoin backed Debit cards, account based web gaming/trading, exchange volumes, etc) which are collateralised by blockchain assets. This means that the settlement layer is simply going to be MORE impacted, not less by the need to eventually clear these through the blockchain.
In conclusion therefore bitcoin doesn't have an option if it wants to arrest its chronic loss of market share. It has to scale its capacity at the native blockchain level. The Lightning Network is not a solution because it's OFF-CHAIN scaling, i.e. addressing the area where the problem isn't.

 on reading your arguments, the following phrase springs to mind:


In other words, bitcoin has lost a full 50% market share over the last 2 years, not in spite of the case you're making but **because** of it. In particular, you conflate two completely unrelated concepts which are those of:
 • centralisation (of various kinds) and
 • counterparty risk
The former alludes to areas of redundancy deficit in the mechanics of the network such as pooled mining resources, overdependency on particular developer groups or hosted markets that may be open to manipulation - all of which bitcoin is excessively affected by and will continue to be after its little ‘upgrade’. The latter implies a type of security which is debt-backed and exposed to debtor default (such as corporate or sovereign bonds) - a risk to which **none** of the mined cryptos are exposed regardless of what scaling or core protocol priorities they make.
Therefore, persuing an on-chain scaling objective compromises neither of these necessarily and the evidence of that fact is in front of your face in the form of said catastrophic loss of bitcoin's market share - at least in terms of capitalisation. The solutions that are currently on offer are not the most ideal - they're just a lifeboat in a storm. The fact that LN is trustless is moot because that isn’t the problem being solved. (For example, a mountain of bitcoin backed trades go on right now using bitcoin-backed debit cards that allow BTC hodlers to access a worldwide network of merchants which took half a century to grow and which LN is not going to get anywhere near in most of our lifetimes as far as adoption goes).
Furthermore, LN is not what it's being presented as, i.e. a 'tier 2' layer for bitcoin. It's a side-by-side client of the BTC network, just as all it's other side-by-side clients are - exchanges, web commerce services, gated off-chain networks like coinbase services etc. Who cares if it's trustless or not - it was invented as a scaling solution which it's clearly not since it's just going to **add** to problem by creating yet new markets to be ultimately funnelled into the blockchain.
Here you go: 
Clearly, the optimal approach ultimately is to persue an on-chain scaling objective but decouple the priorities of decentralisation and greater blockchain liquidity. There are number of ways of doing this, of which recourse to blocksize is only one, and which some significant alt-coins have been pursuing with increasing success (at bitcoin's expense in terms of market share I might add).
