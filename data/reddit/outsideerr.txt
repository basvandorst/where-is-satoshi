I'm sad to hear that Gavin sent a Bitcard over, this shows that he definitely knew of the intentions of Leah. Satoshi told him to stop making him a "shadowy figure" in one of the last messages he sent to Gavin, and yet he still won't let it go. It's his relentless efforts for personal attention (this interview, CIA) that have scared off Satoshi and possibly affected him more here (if this is him).

No, it's the forum they use. If you look, this account announced Bitcoin there in 2009.

"He bought 2 crepes and paid using his smartphone and our QR code with btc address. One crepe and a lemonade was 1 bitcoin at that time :)" He didn't pay 1 BTC

It was mentioned that he had suffered a stroke and cancer so that might have had an influence on his language

Also when they click the 10% discount with bitcoin, maybe link saying something like "how can I buy bitcoins?" and find a good tutorial showing things like Circle and Coinbase.

"endorsed by Gavin" aka from him.

This rubbish, satoshi's addresses have not been touched, what proof do you have? these are fully active accounts.

Who sent this to you? how did you catch it so quickly?...

This seems to be legit, this is the account used to announce Bitcoin to P2P Foundation in 2009, see here: 
I don't know what to think...Satoshi is with us still?...

After some digging, This transaction seems more likely: 
Which leads to this address: 
Which has a lot of transactions and Bitcoin put through it, over $141 Million worth! It doesn't seem to have been active since early 2012 by the looks of things. 
Edit: From hackernews someone located this wallet through the transactions which looks even more promising, seems Satoshi may have been using a tumbler very early on.  $287 million recieved.
I doubt the Tumbler is beatable at all, but I might as well do my best to follow the transactions and see where I get.
EDIT 2: Looks like these addresses probably aren't linked to satoshi, but I encourage everyone to snoop around the Crepe transactions as one of them is him (supposedly) Will probably be in the 1-3 bitcoin range taking into account a tip, I tried ;)

I think it's crazy that there is no way to delete your account on the website, even after this.
