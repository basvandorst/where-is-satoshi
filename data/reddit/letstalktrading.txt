Lixen - Thanks for the feedback.

Don't get me wrong, I am a fan and a believer in Bitcoin. Although, from my own experience and analysis I have strong reason to believe that the Bitcoin bubble is in the middle of bursting. 
I agree that the shutdown of Silk Road created more confidence in Bitcoin. There is no doubt in my mind that in the future similar black markets like Silk Road will be created. 
Bitcoin, in my eyes, is more of a trading instrument rather than a currency used to pay for goods. 
I think that after this bubble bursts there will be an improvement in Bitcoin technology and it will be more widely accepted.

No. I'm actually full of truthful rambling thoughts that may seem ridiculous to some, but they are my ridiculous thoughts nonetheless.

Those day trading restrictions come from various regulatory agencies within the U.S. including the SEC, but mostly FINRA. I just changed the sites formatting a little bit along with what it looks like on the front page. Hopefully it's better now. Did you register btw? I'm going to be releasing free trading software soon along with a "signal system" that traders could use. Tells you when to buy and when to sell to keep things simple. Using a bunch of parameters and tools I have been using over the years. Trying to share my knowledge with the world! :)

This is a fantastic response and I could not agree with you anymore. Thank you for your input.

The US government does function. The USA is a world super power with other countries usually following suit to the actions that they do. For example look at the economic strategy we are utilizing for monetary policy. You see other central banks doing the same exact thing. Following US. FOLLOWING THE SUPER POWER.

Warren Buffet is a funny guy saying that! I admit it that he is correct to some extent, just look what happened during the Great Recession of 2007-2008 when our whole system basically collapsed. So in a way yes he is correct, but at the same time no, he isn't correct because with proper risk management and not being a greedy little piggy like everyone was on Wall Street during that time will insure that you can risk less capital to make a greater reward. I plan on posting a derivatives trading tutorial very soon.

Sorry for the rambling. Many thoughts flowing through my head and it is difficult to organize them all.

Sorry about the rambling. Many thoughts going through my head. Bitcoin may be global, but that doesn't change the fact that the USA is a super power that other countries follow.

That could be a reason, but what I am afraid of is a seller coming into the market and taking advantage of the thin trading volume and lack of transactions. A big sell order would hurt us in the short term, but be a good buy opportunity. Definitely see more confidence. Just trying to figure out how to trade this :)

Yes this bubble is beginning to burst. I have received so much hate mail from my blog post stating why I believe the bubble is burst now. 
@_date: 2013-07-14 23:31:02
YES thank you for that correction.

The USA is a world super power. IDK what you are talking about, but look around you. Concerning economic policies every other country follows suit. Get your facts straight because you can't stop me from rambling on about the truth.

I don't see how the site is sketchy? Thanks for contributing though, but I don't see any problem trying to teach people how to trade. I don't even monetize the site. I'm not trying to make money here. But SURE - sketchy it is if you want to believe that - definitely entitled to your opinion though.

Thanks for the advice. I tried harder on this one

Sorry so many thoughts that I didn't want to leave any out of this article or forget them in the future. I will clean this bad boy up. I just wanted to share my delusional thoughts with the world. I hope you enjoy.
