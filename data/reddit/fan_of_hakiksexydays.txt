lol @ "near zero fees". Trying to make it sound like there's no fees. That just makes you lose your credibility instantly. So no, it's not matching much less outmatching alt coins when it comes to fees. Why not be honest about it?  Also, it will still require to have miners to verify transactions, so that's still an issue. That's also something that has been solved by alts. Trying to be deceptive isn't helping anyone.

Weird, I'm looking at the price of Bitcoin right now, doesn't look like I'm the one who's the idiot. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:45:13
There's many possible scenarios. What I think is most likely is initially it would go down. That's just how people naturally react, and that's the first type of investment that gets pulled when there's a downturn. Also you're gonna see a lot of big whales needing liquidity to buy the dip in the market. But I think a recession might eventually bring back investors to Bitcoin, if nothing else is making money. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:29:08
The math is completely wrong. He implies that if the user base for Bitcoin increases to 12 times, then the price will increase 12 times to what it is now. 
That's not how the pricing works. An increase of people doesn't increase the price at the same constant rate. Price is entirely determined by what price people are willing to pay. And you would actually need an exponential increase in investment to maintain the same constant rate of increases, because price and market caps are gonna increase too. And when you're using the past rates of Bitcoin as your guideline, you're talking about extremely high rates of increase. You'd be talking about turning a $1 trillion market cap into a $10 trillion market cap in the span of a year. That's pretty much impossible. 
A $1M Bitcoin actually means a market cap of somewhere around $20 trillion. That's a bit of a stretch. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:18:39
If there was a formula to predict that, I'd be a millionaire. First off, prices are dictated by people, and people don't make decisions based on math like computers, they make more emotional decisions. How do you predict that? Bitcoin is even more difficult, as people are faced with so much conflicting information and misinformation. 
Normally, I would use the data on transactions to predict the price. But even that hasn't correlated. The price shot up by over 1000% in a few months, with only a mild increase in usage for transactions. 
If you were to assume that there's no competing alt coins that are even gonna threaten Bitcoin, and everything is just gonna nicely stay the course from now on, and everything stays rosy, then you're likely to see prices stabilizing over time. Hypothetically, you'd be looking at Bitcoin staying under $50k for a long while, and not reaching $100k for years. And taking decades to reach $200k. You're talking about doubling trillion dollar market caps. That doesn't happen in a few years. And this would be in the most ideal case.

@_date: 2018-01-23 00:05:17
If it goes down to $1k, it's not gonna be for a good reason. That's gonna be out of some serious bad news, or maybe getting overtaken by another coin. If it goes down that low, you're gonna have to ask some serious questions. It's not gonna be because most Bitcoin owner will all the sudden stop remembering its great potential.

I've seen dumb comments. But this one really takes the cake. 
That's like saying it doesn't matter what the conversion of Zimbabwean dollar is. Except a billion Zimbabwean dollars that could once buy you incredible wealth and power, can now only buy you a pack of gum. So yea, it kinda matters. It's actually the most important part of a currency, LOL.

Bitcoin doesn't have to be the most advanced or the best crypto to be the best investment. It's by no means the best in practicality, nor the best in terms of the technology. But that hasn't prevented it from being worth and bought the most. It's definitely the best as in the most proven coin. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:19:40
Are you seriously saying it's better to lose half of your investment? You do realize investments are about MAKING money, and the more the better, not losing money. 
Weird how someone with "experience" doesn't even understand the concept of protecting an investment, or even the most basic concept of making money, as in buy low and sell high. I can't believe I actually have to explain this to someone. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:20:39
There's no analyst, mathematician, math formula that can predict Bitcoin, because there's no math formula that can predict emotion. 
Bitcoin aren't bought and sold by robots and math equations. They're traded by people reacting on emotion with both rational and irrational judgement, and a combination of good and bad information.

Hopefully, people who had their heads buried in the sand, saying there was no bubble, will have learned their lesson now. 
You can't say they weren't warned. It was such an obvious bubble, with every sign in the book, and every expert warning them.

I think we'll probably be back over 15k within a couple months, maybe within a couple weeks, barring any bad news. It's gonna be a little harder now to get back over $20k after everything that's happened recently, and how alt coins have been growing and attracting more investors, including entry-level investors. 
The reality is the majority of the new money coming in, is from people who are looking to make a big buck on very high rises from what they hope will be the next Bitcoin. They're not interested in maybe doubling 11k into what they hope will be 20k, and maybe one day 100k. They're more interested in turning $0.35 into $3.50 in just a couple of months, and maybe into $350 and even $3,500 in a couple years.

I honestly think this is the year Bitcoin gets overtaken by another crypto. Look at everything that's happened to Bitcoin, and what's happening now. Bitcoin was a great experiment and led the way. But like every first in history, the first product on the vanguard, usually is the first one to take the bullet for everyone else. It's the one behind it that learns form its mistakes that makes it.

Clearly you haven't learned anything from these past couple months. You don't want advice from hodlers. They just lost more than half the value of their investment, and missed a chance to protect their investment, and also the chance to potentially buy back at a lower price and make more money. Plus, if you're gonna hodl, then dips and peaks wouldn't even matter. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:45:11
Actually I have a friend on LinkedIn who just wrote an article about his returns. If he had hodl'd, he'd be at about $44,000. But he didn't hodl'd. Instead he was at a little over $86,000 and pulled out when it was starting to go too high too quickly. And he bought back $44,000 in bitcoin at just under 10k. So he's back in the same position as he would have been if he had hodl'd. And he's got now an extra 42k. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:54:44
It hasn't. Where are you getting that 1:1 ratio? If you look at the amount of wallets (assuming even most people only have 1 wallet), at any point in history, it hasn't correlated to the price changes, and is not moving at the same rate. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:15:40
$12k might still be too high before it can settle. Remember, only just last November we were at around $6k, and that already seemed really high. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:15:04
Exactly how would anyone be able to know this, and be able to tell which transactions are illegal? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:29:17
If you're only interested in the technology side and innovation, then you'd be more interested in Ethereum, or other alt-currencies who have more evolved and and more promising innovative systems behind their coins than Bitcoin. Bitcoin's strength compared to alt-currencies, is not the technology, it's its establishment on the market.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:55:30
 On paper, yes, you could make thousands of dollars a month day-trading cryptocurrencies. In reality, it's not that easy to get it right every time. People who do that tend to fall into traps thinking they're seeing sure patterns. That's when you get nasty surprises and lose a lot of money.
By far the worst part has to be reporting the taxes. I don't know how you would even go about it. It  sounds like an absolute nightmare, and a colossal task. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:25:59
If I had 50K as my goal. I would actually sell just before. At $49,990. $50k is one of those dangerous psychological landmark price. I forgot what's the name for it. But that's when there's a higher chance of a sell off, maybe even a crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:49:18

This comment illustrates people's misunderstanding between Bitcoin and blockchain technology, and their inability to separate the two. Bitcoin is not all, nor the only cryptocurrency, nor the only application of blockchain. The technology behind it is the future, it's what's gonna shake up how we do finance, but there's still a lot of tweaking and a lot of work to be done. It's a great experiment, but looking at the bigger picture of the future of all cryptocurrency, I think it is only one of many steps. 
What the sudden stampede of Bitcoin hodlers and hoarders don't realize is they don't contribute to the project to the level they think, many are even damaging it, and forget it's a currency. I've been working on the Bitcoin project since 2010, and I feel like all our work is taking steps backwards now. I can't even properly use it for transactions anymore, the wild price changes are a nightmare. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:20:47
Actually 99.9999% of your timing with any investment, is gonna be wrong. There's a tiny fraction of a chance that you'll be able to hold without missing the best window, or sell without selling too soon. There's an even smaller chance of buying at its lowest and selling at its highest. That would already require a time machine.
Seeing as time passes, it becomes more and more obvious that there is a bubble. It definitely seems like there will be a painful window where it will be a very bad time to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:12:55

There's actually a simple way to figure out the real value of Bitcoin, when it's not inflated by speculation, but taking into account it's historic value, and it's actual value in currency, usage, and actual transactions. And that number is actually around $1,500. This is not pixie dust number. It's based on the actual data from actual transactions and usage. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:52:43
Gold is something you can hold in your hand. It's used for jewelry and for industrial material. So even if it loses its imaginary value, it still has use. And if you bought gold in the form of coin, you'll still have something collectible you can sell on ebay.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:50:48
It certainly isn't good for Bitcoin. What it basically means, is there's no legal protection for unfair targeting of Bitcoin, Bitcoin related sites, exchanges, by ISP companies like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&amp;T. 
Also, we're not in the friendlier environment from the days before net neutrality. We're now looking at no net neutrality under a Trump administration, with someone like Ajit Pai at the head of the FCC. This a very Bitcoin-phobic administration. 
Exchanges is what I'm more nervous about. There's no legal protection for them. We could lose access to the exchanges if we have Verizon, Comcast, or AT&amp;T. These companies could even go beyond that. I don't think they're gonna use that much power, at least not initially. But they do have that power now. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:10:47
The problem is I understand the real value of Bitcoin. It's a great project, and I've been with it since 2010. It's worth a lot, maybe more than gold. But it's definitely not worth $15,000 a piece. That price has no justification anymore, and is held up by blindly exuberant people who don't fully understand what they're buying. And don't understand there are still enormous risks. Bitcoin still has a lot of big question marks and red flags. Is it the crypto of the future? There's honestly much better crypto our there, and people keep working on making them even better. We're still at the early stages, we've only just explored the beginning of what we can do with crypto. Blockchain is a great start, but I think it's only a start. There's already work on alternatives and improvements to blockchain.
I think once the "get rich quick" train stops, and people start understanding what Bitcoin really is and does, and where it stands, the dust is gonna settle. And things will go back to more realistic prices in the hundreds maybe as high as the low thousands. So yea, I'm definitely not interested in going long right now with these ridiculous prices that nobody seems to understand. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:09:07
That's true, but that would be significant if Bitcoin was the only currency doing that. Ripple is looking more and more like the go to choice for bank transfers. And other cryptos have the advantage of smaller fees. So there is some pressure on Bitcoin.

lol @ "can't lose long term if you HOLD". 
That's what's scary about Bitcoin right now, is the amount of newbie investors. Of course you can still lose if you hold.
You probably heard seasoned investors talk about holding being a smart move. Meaning it's safer to hold long term than to try to time the market. But they're referring to a well diversified portfolio. It's in references to things like the Dow Jones industrial, which historically has been going up steadily in the long run. 
When talking about Bitcoin, holding can mean making more money, or it can mean holding too long until it becomes worth as much as Monopoly money, because maybe another cryptocurrency takes over, or simply because people realize it's overpriced.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:29:51

Obviously I was only gonna compare it to 1 oz of gold, as that's the price most people would probably know or have a rough idea what it's worth. I wasn't gonna make people do a bunch of calculations or have to google the equivalent. This is still reddit.

Paper money is a promise backed by a government with assets and an economy. With Bitcoin you don't have any of that. Which is partly a great thing, and frees it up from a lot of restrictions. But at the same time, it means there's little real value behind it, and has the potential to quickly become worth less than thin air.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:34:30
Bitcoin reminds me of Beanie Babies. 
There was this same completely absurd hype and euphoria over them. You couldn't reason with collectors because they argued that Beanie Babies were an investment, and would be worth 10 to 100 times what they are now. And at the time, they could already sell them for much more than what they bought them for.
Until one day reality hit everyone, far too many people were buying for the same reason, to make a quick buck and sell them to everyone else. But everyone else was doing the same thing. That's the problem, most people buying Bitcoins now are not doing it because of some major game changing news about them, or because of a specific use, but to hoard them to sell them later. It's good for the price because it makes everyone a buyer. But what happens when they all wanna sell, but since everyone is gonna be doing the same thing, there won't be enough people wanting to buy.
I remember when everyone thought it was crazy that Bitcoins were worth almost as much as an ounce of gold. That was back when it hit $1000. The current price now has no justification anymore. It's pure insanity at this point.

There's not one strategy, that's the whole point. There's a lot of different things you can do with your investment. It doesn't have to be an all in, all your eggs in one basket situation. Nor constantly timing dips and peaks. 
I personally like to create ladders, secure portions of gains. And I build something like a hodl position out of a portion of my gains. Eventually that hodl position will be made of nothing but gains, and my original money will be eventually back in my pocket. So it will be pretty much like I'm not exposed anymore. So I'm basically playing it safe. I also get opportunistic when there's crashes. But when the prices get to scary heights, I start selling bit by bit the portion that I'm not hodling. The portion that's a little closer to day trading, but really is more like week trading.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:31:45
The biggest problem is that most people who are buying now, aren't even using them as a currency. If this was all coming from a huge surge in usage, I wouldn't be as worried. 
But this is all millionaire wannabees, just hoarding bictoins, and treating them like they are collectible Beanie Babies that will one day be 10 times the value. These people aren't holding Bitcoins for any use, they're meant to be all cashed in at some point. But the second there's a bad news about Bitcoin, or there's a downturn with the economy. What happens when all these people need to cash in?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:24:27
I think more realistically we could be looking at $50 fees, maybe even $100. Those will already push a lot of people out of the market. That huge chunk of people only trading under 1btc transactions. It will also make it very unattractive for businesses to adopt Bitcoin.

Everyone has different goals and usage. And some people may not want to have their money sitting idle in something that has turned into a bubble.

bigelmofarts is giving you some sensible advice. If you also have debts, Bitcoin should be a very low priority, maybe even something you shouldn't be touching at this point. 
If you're not doing well financially, your first priority is to get out of debts and things that are holding you back, and build a solid financial foundation first, with savings, retirement accounts, and safe things first to fall back on. Then you can start with blue chip stocks or solid companies, where you'll likely see steady gains and can start building on. At least you'll get dividends, and not have your money dormant on Bitcoin in the hopes that it will still be worth something the day you decide to pull out.
Once you have a foundation, you can start putting a little money into high risk investments and little gambles. Like many people have said, only put as much money into Bitcoin as you can handle to lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:08:31
Believing there is a bubble is not the same as not believing in Bitcoin.

I just don't like this new influx of clueless Bitcoin hoarders who just wanna get rich quick because they saw a story on their Facebook about kids turning millionaires with Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-30 18:06:58
I've researched this a little. And based on where the price should be, if things were taking a normal course without the FOMO exhuberance, and the more logical and fair price based on usage as a currency. The fair price value of Bitcoin is between $2,000-$3,000. This was calculated before the rise in fees. I haven't checked the figures since, but I would expect it has dropped now. 
But this estimate is only looking at Bitcoin as a usable currency, with expectations of it being the dominant cryptocurrency. It's not taking into account its trading value as a commodity. That's just something that can't really be calculated. This is where you can say it's worth $2,000 or $200,000.

I really don't think you understand what net neutrality is. You may want to look it up first. Losing net neutrality means losing freedom. Companies like Verizon and Comcast will decide what you can see. And you'll probably see a price increase for less content.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:02:13
If you buy now, it's not to keep it very long. The price is getting in dangerously high territory. And you'll want to secure smaller gains, rather than be greedy and incur major losses.
The forces that are pushing the price up right now, barring any major bad news, will likely carry some momentum for a while, and into 2018. So there should still be a little room to make gains. But there's obviously a bubble here. So eventually there's gonna be a very big correction or a crash. Since it correlates to the percentage of the spike in price, the high spike suggest a very steep crash. You'll hopefully have sold before that happens. But nobody has a crystal ball. And these things are hard to time.
Once it settles after the crash, if it doesn't look like everyone is bailing out of Bitcoin, or that there's a major problem with it, you can get back in at a much lower price than everyone is paying right now. That's really the best time to get in. And that could happen as early as 2018.

There's a common misconception that there can only be one coin. That usually stems from a lack of understanding of the wide applications of the technology behind cryptocurrencies, and the whole world of fintech and its various financial needs. 
Cryptocurrency isn't just about buying a bag of chips at the store. In fact, Bitcoin may not be the ideal system for that. Bitcoin is probably gonna be the gold standard of cryptocurrency, and have its primary usage as storage and personal banking. The future will probably have at least a dozen different cryptocurrencies with different functions. Some specializing in speed and low fees by sacrificing decentralization, while others sacrifice other functions to have the best secrecy and anonymity. Some may even be tailored to a specific industry like healthcare or real estate. 
It never hurts to diversify a little. Some have really good potential. Why pass off on an opportunity to make some money, especially when even some of the good ones dropped by 90%, which is just as much as the shitty ones. You got some serious bargains right now.

Exactly. I couldn't go into details, because my original post was a mile long, and I just wanted to get the main point across first. 
But yea, that's another strategy. With the way Bitcoin rises, you could even wait until you double, and get your original investment back, and just trade with the gains, which is money you didn't have in the first place. Once you manage to get to that point, it's like you're not risking any of your money anymore. Luckily with Bitcoin doubling can happen for some people. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:08:17
There is one metric that gives it its core value. Usage and acceptance, which is measured by transactions. Bitcoin is not a product, a service, or a resource. It's real initial value comes from people actually using it for what it's meant. That's the whole essence of Bitcoin. And historically, before things went nuts in the past couple years, the price of Bitcoin was following closely the usage growth, and was always going back to it when it strayed away. When you buy into a cryptocurrency, you buy into something that's being accepted and being used. Because it's not backed by anything. That's the only value you can give it.

@_date: 2017-12-08 20:53:02
But then we're just gonna turn it into a Ponzi and not a viable currency. The growth should come from organic value as a currency, with more actual usage and adoption, not just more people hoarding it, and hoping to sell it to the next person for more.

"likely" is the keyword. Of course there's gonna be exceptions, but I'm not talking about exceptions. A startup is probably not gonna raise a lot of red flags, as it's already in red flag territory. But if something like Apple is gonna tank, we're gonna see some signs first. There's always signs. And the bigger cap the stock, and the more it's a long standing company, the more you'll get warnings.
A big chunk of Bitcoin is owned by few people. You're literally talking about a couple thousand people owning a significant portion of the Bitcoin market. For all we know the rise in price is partly caused by a pump and dump. There's the fact that it's a complete blind market. There's no metrics to give us an idea of what's really going on. Commodities like gold, has strong connection to the industrial market, semiconductors. Things we can measure that affect the price. Bitcoin can just too easily blindside you. We keep getting blindsided by unexpected spikes in price. Those spikes could just as easily go down.
Some companies don't pay much if any in dividends, but the point is you have the option of getting something, as opposed to never having the option of getting something.

I wouldn't recommend investing a large part of your portfolio on Bitcoin. And I would also spread into one or two cryptos. So it depends on how much of your money that is. Nor would I recommend taking advice from Reddit, LOL. Like many have said, only put in as much as you are ready to lose. There's a lot of good youtube videos and sites that explain the exchanges (depending on where you live), and how to set up a wallet so your money doesn't sit on the exchange.

On earth? On reddit? Or talking about bitcoin?
I'm guessing the latter? Because I've been involved with Bitcoin since the beginning. I don't have a stake in it right now as an investment, I only use it for transactions. So in that sense, I can offer an unbiased opinion on the investment side, on top of my long history with it. 
I'm not gonna be one of those people trying to push the price up, getting people to buy more and not sell, just for the sake of making my coins worth more.

I wonder if the whales are planning to use the SEC decision in 5 days to make another huge dump. Even if at this point, a delay or rejection is pretty much expected and shouldn't have that much of a negative  impact. But just like that fake Goldman Sachs story, everyone is always looking for a reason when they see the price dive, and it does add fuel to the panic.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:00:39
It certainly isn't good for Bitcoin. What it basically means, is there's no legal protection for unfair targeting of Bitcoin, Bitcoin related sites, exchanges, by ISP companies like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&amp;T.
Also, we're not in the friendlier environment from the days before net neutrality. We're now looking at no net neutrality under a Trump administration, with someone like Ajit Pai at the head of the FCC. This a very Bitcoin-phobic administration.
Exchanges is what I'm more nervous about. There's no legal protection for them. We could lose access to the exchanges if we have Verizon, Comcast, or AT&amp;T. These companies could even go beyond that. I don't think they're gonna use that much power, at least not initially. But they do have that power now.
@_date: 2018-09-16 21:44:26
Even if the majority of the recipients all decide they're just gonna hang on to their Bitcoins and not sell, and in the best case scenario only less than 20% decide to sell, that's still 20% of about a billion. If too many sell around the same time, and it's not spread out enough, in the current state of the market with no strong confidence and low volume, that will probably still have an impact. 
Now if a lot more people than that decide to sell, or the majority sells, we could be in for a pretty major drop.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:49:59
It depends on the cause of the crash. If it's a crash that directly has a very negative effect on FIAT currencies, it might be a scenario where it might be good.
But there's not many scenarios where something lilke the dollar is gonna drop like a stone. It would take something significant.
Your average stock market crash or correction, would probably not bode well for Bitcoin. The first things people will liquidate from their portfolios, are obviously the riskier and peripheral things like cryptocurrencies. You weather a crash with your safe, proven, and non-volatile securities. The usual stuff people always turn to whenever there's a crash. Things like gold. And you cut lose the sensitive stuff. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:57:29
Crash doesn't mean it's going to 0. Maybe that's why people don't believe it's gonna crash. 
A crash can technically be as little as a 10% drop if it happens in a very short time frame. But usually anything under 20% is considered a correction, if it's followed by normality. 
But the crash everyone is talking about is something that will bring the price down very significantly, back to a previous point before a recent spike, to just an emotional price that people won't panic over anymore. So it could be a lot, or not that much. Realistically, it could even go back down to $2,000. But not 0, lol. The only thing that can bring it to zero, is if "Satoshi" had some kind of kill switch.

You have to look at the technology itself, and the mechanics behind Bitcoin. And also all the pros and cons of what it offers.
It's hard to deny the potential of alt currencies. At least on paper, some of them offer a clearly better alternative. In practice, not so much yet. Bitcoin's main advantage is its dominance and adoption. But it has flaws that other currencies don't have.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:17:14
That's true, but stocks don't work like cryptocurrency at all. You could say that there is an element of betting on Bitcoin like it's a commodity, and that gives it an element where people bet on where the price is gonna go in the future, and the amount of future growth in usage. So my number is probably on the conservative side.
Keep in mind that Bitcoin is not the technology. They're not selling blockchain. So if you're talking about betting on the future of the technology, Bitcoin is not that place.
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:29:41
They'll rise back up as soon as there's a bull run. It's always like that. The second the market is positive, people will rush back to all cryptos trying to make some big quick gains with low priced alts. And they will affect the dominance of Bitcoin. Which does really well in bearish times, but declines when things get very bullish.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:41:05
How is it better than stocks? If a stock tanks, goes bankrupt, at least you've been getting dividends. It's not just idle money. Plus stocks are more likely to give you warnings before they tank. Bitcoin could implode without any warnings.
If Bitcoin tanks, you got nothing. It doesn't even have to tank, you can lose your wallet or get hacked, and everything is gone. If you get your eTrade account hacked, it's not something on an anonymous network. There's a chance you can recover your money.

The numbers are based on the history of the price. Back when spikes in growth correlated with actual things, news, usage and growing adoption, growing transactions, etc...
Back when Bitcoin wasn't getting a massive inflow of speculative buyers. 
Notice after $2,000 there hasn't been any major news about changes to Bitcoin: 
I didn't actually give any specific numbers, but I could. Since 2017, the amount of Bitcoin transactions per day only went up from 250k to 400k. To put that into perspective, in 2015 it had already hit 200k transaction a day. So the transaction numbers this year are not that far from previous years.
Yet the price this year alone has shot up 1600%, when actual usage and adoption as a currency hasn't even doubled. 
Here's a chart of what happened the last time the price went far above the actual currency usage:
So the actual value of a Bitcoin is roughly around $1,500 right now. It's a bit like the laws of physics. Right now we're stretching out the price unnaturally like a rubber band, but eventually it will want to get back to it's natural state at around $1,500. Which probably by the time it finally crashes will be around $2,000.

I've been saying this for a while. Bitcoin is still pretty easy to manipulate. There's still a relatively small amount of people controlling a major chunk of the Bitcoins in the world. Bitcoin futures is just what they need.
I wouldn't be surprised if there was already some collusion going on. There's always some greedy shady people out there with a lot of money, never wanting to miss an opportunity like this. I wouldn't be surprised if a pump and dump was already in the works.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:24:09
There's nothing indicating undervalue. Undervalue happens when the price is lower than correlating metrics. We don't have things like p/e ratios, sales growth, etc, with Bitcoin. But we do know several things, like daily transaction. And things like that show that there hasn't been that big of a growth in usage and adoption. In fact, the discrepancy is rather alarming. We do see a growth in the value of transactions. But I don't think it's because people are using it to buy cars. It's probably because people are hoarding large sums.
If you are looking at only potential, that becomes purely subjective. But with competing cryptocurrencies offering lower fees, even offering better solutions and better networks, you can make a better argument that the future of Bitcoin is looking more overvalued than undervalued. I wouldn't even invest in Bitcoin alone at this point. It's not looking like a guaranteed wining horse anymore. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:44:54
Are we at the peak now? Or is there still enough gas in the tank to hit 7.5k?
I'm still hoping it will hit $9k very soon, so I can be completely in the green. But you gotta be realistic. There's probably gonna be some more bumps on the road. But I know we'll get there eventually. No need to freak out if it dips again.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:49:53
I should have written it down. But you can find daily transaction volumes online. Then see what the standard deviation is with the BTCUSD price for the same time. The more dates you use the more accurate it gets. There's a really abnormal deviation from volume in October. After that there's a clear anomaly. If you continue on the same average, we should be at no more than $2,000 now, as the volume is only around $400k right now.
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:50:36
The last major peak was at the end of July, at around $8400. The one before that was around $9800. 
The last two rallies lasted less than 4 weeks, then under 3 weeks. This new rally started on August 21, after the ETF rejection. 
So if this rally can last another week, even just one more weekend, and get past $8000, it could definitely be a sign of a trend reversal.

eTrade is fine. Just check what other online brokers offer. All the major ones are fine. Compare who has the lower fees, etc...(you really shouldn't have to pay more than $7). See who has special offers, but be careful with those "first 30 days trades are free". It's not worth it if the trade fees after that are high. Or 100 free trades the first year. Usually it's calculated so you don't really get anything that exceptional. So don't get swayed too easily by those. But they can help a little.
Also, if you plan on trading ETFs and Mutual Funds with them, check those fees too, because those can vary a lot.

For tax purposes, you'll want to consider selling your Bitcoin before the new year, if you're expecting bigger gains in 2018, or more income, and 2017 wasn't a good financial year for you. See if you may enjoy your gains at a lower tax rate, than if you were to sell it in 2018.
Otherwise, you may want to see where you expect Bitcoin to go next year, and see if you want to continue this ride. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 05:41:29
We haven't even broken the 2 billion mark for a while. Bitcoin has been mostly hovering below the 10K BTC volume most of the time. Or did you mean 4 billion for the week? Whatever timeline you want to use, it's been low any way you want to cut it. 
On top of the low declared volume, you have to take into account the 60% fictional volume from the exchanges. So the real volume is even lower than that. Even on a day when we had pump and dumps and you might have seen a 4B volume, it was probably still under 2B. And you can really see it in the changes of the price, getting stuck around a price for a while, then within hours sometimes minutes, a few parties are able to bring the price up and down by $500, sometimes $1k. You're talking about price changes of well over 5%. This doesn't happen like that, that often in short periods of times when there's a healthy volume.

There's not really a one place stop. I would start first with some simple Youtube videos explaining key things like market cap, P/E ratio, EPS, debts, dividends, quarter earnings, and understanding how stocks are priced and how to read the data in a quote.
This way when you read a quote on Nasdaq, or Yahoo, or Marketwatch, you know how to interpret all the data and can pick up on some of the red flags or interpret the risks. 
But the way to educate yourself about a stock in general, is to do a little research about the company. Maybe start with products you use and know well. This way you already have a good idea of what product they're good at, if they sell well, and if they have a good pipeline. 
Just a heads up if you want to jump into the market right now. Many consider the market to be pretty high right now. This doesn't mean you shouldn't get in, but if you do, it's probably to hold long, because there's probably gonna be at least a correction soon. I would go for something high dividend right now, maybe in the energy (oil) sector, but there's many ways you can approach this.

That wasn't a completely stupid decision. Unless you actually had a crystal ball. You came out of this with $5,600 per coin safely in your pocket. You probably shouldn't have done the second part. But that you know with hindsight. In the unlikely event Bitcoin had crashed right after that price, and Bcash would have soared, you would have been the cryptocurrency genius of the century. 
Most of the time, you're gonna miss the mark when you sell, see your investment continue to go up when you pull out, or stay too long and miss the best chance to pull out. And you're gonna feel like you can never win, or at least never win the most.
Welcome to the world of investing. Don't drive yourself crazy by not "timing" it right. It's next to impossible to do that. 99.9999% of people investing in bitcoin are gonna time it wrong. They're gonna hold it too long or sell it too early. Less than a fraction of 1% are gonna get it just right. But that's OK. As long as you've achieved something close to your goal, or came out with something decent, it doesn't have to be the best outcome. You'll drive yourself crazy trying to get that.
Also, the same adventurous risk taking mindset that got you a ton of money with Bitcoin, is the same risk taking mindset that's gonna get you to lose a lot of money by hoping to replicate those gains with crap like Bcash.

If there's a correction, it's a sign that something was wrong with the original price, or maybe there was some issue, or for whatever reason, something changed about the consensus about the price. That's a symptom of a change in consensus, it's not a sign that things are "healthy". And it doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing, nor that things will be OK now.

I think it will peak again at $20k, maybe a little above. But with fees so high and transactions so slow, it's lost a lot of its usability. $40k is starting to look less likely.
Unfortunately, I don't think we'll see the fixes in time before people start going more for alt currencies. We've seen how fast Ripple and IOTA have risen to take a big chunk of the crypto market, along with Litecoin and Etherum. And out of nearly 300 alt coins, I think the coin of the future is already out there. We just don't know which one it is yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:36:39
Not necessarily. You do have a much bigger cushion before you go in the red. But if it crashes too fast, and there's a jam in the exchange, which can very well happen, you might not even stay in the green. Especially if you hesitate too long.
Exchanging your money could take a while. Especially if there's a big run on the exchanges. Just a few days ago, Coinbase had a big hold up with too many transactions. Your money could be stuck as Bitcoin before you can pull out in time.

These days you have to be really careful with popular TAs. They're traps.
Whales are using the most popular TAs to play their little manipulative games. If a TA chart becomes really popular and gets shared a lot all over social media, and many people start having the same expectation about that TA's prediction, you can be sure some whale out there will use that to their advantage. That's why when you see a really popular TA that everyone talks about, be really careful. Those are the ones that can burn you.

Very horrible advice. "Always" is a word you can't trust in the world of investments. And just because something has gone up in the past, and followed what seems like a trend, doesn't mean it will continue to do the exact same thing, and is always gonna go up.

Personally, I'm seriously considering adding ETH to my portfolio. I can't believe it's under $200 now, when it was $1300 at its peak, and more importantly, at $800 in its re-peak.
I think it's gonna bleed some more, so we could see some serious bargains here. Especially since China seems to be very interested in ETH. I'm personally not a huge fan of ETH, but I'm a fan of value, and the undervalued, and anything that has a lot of major players interested in it.
But BITCOIN still rules them all.

The alts landscapes has dramatically changed. There's been a lot of innovation recently. What you're talking about then, is not what we have now. It's also gone up in value. And now some of the technology has surpassed Bitcoin.
Cryptocurrency is like any other tech. It changes really fast. What was hot a couple of years ago, can become old news or obsolete with better innovation. Cryptocurrency is still in its early experimental stage, and we're still exploring all the possibilities and applications. People don't realize there's still a lot more that can be improved. And what we are working with today, is probably not the final product that we're gonna be using in 10 years. Blockchain may not be the only or even the best approach. Or at least in the way we are using it now.
Maybe you had a bad experience with alt. With so many of them, it's easy to make a mistake and bank on a bogus one, especially if you're looking at ICO. I know a lot of people lost money with ICOs. But it might be time to revisit them.

Unless we get some serious new adoption like Amazon or Walmart accepting Bitcoin, it's gonna be hard to have another fomo bull run until we get closer to the next halvening. We're probably gonna have some good stuff like Bakkt propelling Bitcoin into maybe $8-9k. But psychologically it's always hard for a market to jump back in that soon after a major crash and major bear market. There's always a long period of caution and cold feet by the general public.
@_date: 2018-09-17 14:52:40
What matters is how much real volume is being traded at the time of the dump. And right now the volume is really low. 
Despite the best estimates based on declared volume at around $2-$4Bilion, the real volume is no higher than around $0.8-$1.6 Billion. That's what's actually being traded daily on average, and it's possibly even lower since there's no real regulation on this. So that $1 Billion is probably worth more than what the entire market is really trading on the day. 
That's why it only took under $500 million worth of Bitcoin for the recent $1k drop in price. Which may have been triggered with really only $200 million. But we're talking about a Billion. Even in a best case scenario if most of them don't sell, and only a third of them sell, that's still 30% of a Billion. They would have to dilute all their trades over a long period of time, just to have the price stay steady. Otherwise, in our best case scenario, you'd still be looking at a drop in price between $500-$1,000, assuming the price drop doesn't trigger a further panic. 
TL;DR: 
best case scenario: most don't sell, the few that sell dilute their sales over a long period of time and the price stays steady for while. 
worst case scenario: Most sell, and almost half a billion gets sold within a few days, causes a panic, the price goes down by almost $2k. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 14:20:00
It's mostly Whales and because the volume is very low, making it easier for them. We don't have that much mainstream money coming in, no influx of volume from fomo or bullish sentiments. About 60% of the volume you see right now on most exchanges, is not actually there, it's artificial volume. That's why it's been so easy for them to swing the price by $1K in one direction or another.

It's definitely nice growth! Organic, not so much. 
It's been driven by a series of quick sharp pumps, some were obviously from shorts squeezes. Very rapid 5% shifts within a day, sometimes within hours, is really stretching the definition of organic. Plus there hasn't been any evidence of that much new mainstream money coming in yet. But hopefully the organic growth will come soon. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 00:04:43
I don't think too many people are actually selling. I think the volume is so low right now, that whales can just trigger stop losses from traders and trigger the price to go up in just minutes, or dive down. Right now they can very easily bring the price back down in the $5Ks, and I wouldn't be surprised if these greedy bastards are gonna do that 
@_date: 2018-09-01 13:49:38

You shouldn't be selling. There's nothing wrong with Bitcoin, all these price dives are just manipulation. Unless you wanna play games with the whales. Whenever there is a serious spike, you can be sure there's gonna be a major dump right behind it. We seem to keep coming back around $6.4k. So I guess you could make some quick short term money.

Realistically, Bitcoin is looking less like the currency of the future, and more like the new gold. Retailers aren't big fans of it. And there's already coins doing faster and cheaper transactions. Even with Lightning Network, which isn't turning out to be quiet what was promised. The future of everyday transactions is probably gonna be a more adapted and more efficient next gen coin.
But the future of what's important, personally controlled banking and wealth storage and transfer, is gonna be Bitcoin. It's gonna be the gold of the next generation.

@_date: 2018-09-18 19:14:38
You need a delorean I think lol. 
I travel a lot, so I've been able to test first hand the whole "I use Bitcoin only" theory. I've been to Tokyo, Berlin, Shanghai, Zurich, Coppenhagen, etc. Many of those "crypto" cities. And I still couldn't rely on just Bitcoin, and I really tried. In fact it was a lot harder to find places to spend Bitcoin than the internet makes it out to be. You can't just go out there and hope you're gonna just run into a place that takes Bitcoin, you have to do some digging first. You won't find too many Bitcoin signs, and often businesses post a Bitcoin sign for show, but when you actually show up with Bitcoin they say they can't accept it, or their system is not up yet or they will have it soon. But it's getting there.
I think many of the people who claim they use only Bitcoin, aren't necessarily lying, I think many of them use these debit cards that you can buy with Bitcoin, but really convert it to fiat so any business can accept it. Personally I see that as conceding. I prefer to always ask businesses if they accept Bitcoin, just to let them know there is a real demand there, and then just let them be hit with my Visa card fee. "Oh yea BTW, Bitcoin won't scam you with fees like that, transactions are just pennies, so you'll save a lot of money".

If you can't see it's a bubble, then you have absolutely no clue what's going on, and probably shouldn't be investing in something you don't understand. The price surge has exceeded past any increase in usage or adoption as a currency. So the price doesn't correlate to any actual growth. Its increase comes from speculation. If you look at any of the metrics it's become undeniably in bubble territory. 
The question is not is it in a bubble, the question is when. I'm still buying Bitcoins, despite the bubble, because it seems to be a flexible one, and a lot of people will continue to blindly buy into it to get in on the action. So there's still money to be made. But I'm under no illusion that it will surge forever.

A wallet can just as easily be worth $0.01 or $1 million. You can't measure a market with that. Wallets are always gonna steadily increase...since you can't uncreate wallets lol.
And did you even click your own link for transactions? It doesn't show anything that looks remotely like a nice steady growth. In fact these last months we've been flatlining, rarely ever touching the 250,000 mark, when for a while that was the average, and we were hitting highs over 450,000. Any steady increase has long stopped back over a year ago.

As stoked as I was to see the price breach $7k, I'm not trusting this spike just yet. It's built on a shaky house of cards. It's not coming from new mainstream money who are suddenly trusting Bitcoin, or anything like that. It's mostly just caused by shorts squeeze. So it's still just whale games and the same inside money coming back. 
But if we can get some good news and have significant new money coming in and build on this recent spike, we could start a real rally. Maybe hit $9K so all my coins are finally in the green.

Seeing how high shorts and RSIs are, how low the volume is, plus still thousands of Bitcoin with that mystery wallet, it would take a lot of luck not to be hit with another dip. 
But this bear market is probably near its end. We're probably gonna enter the "flattening" in the next couple months. Hopefully this flattening won't be too long, and we can get back to a bull run early next year, maybe even at the end of the year if we've been good.
@_date: 2018-08-19 14:36:04
One thing is sure, it definitely won't be Bitcoin.
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are only practical for individuals, and private entities. They're meant to give power back to individuals. It's completely pointless for a government to use Bitcoin, and defies the point of a national currency, since you can't control it and adjust the supply.
But there are ways countries could create their own crypto or crypto-like currencies as their national currency. It will not be decentralized, and might be something a bit like tether, attached to their actual money. This doesn't mean that people can't still use Bitcoin.
I think in the future, we'll be using a lot of different currencies in tandem within the same country. Currencies won't be so much about countries, but about different functions.
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:24:17
low 6Ks and high 5Ks is where the strong support has been. That's probably where it's gonna stop dropping and people start buying. But since we've already been there recently, if we visit that again, there could be less confidence this time around, and we could end up a little lower.
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:31:56
I really want to believe we're out of the woods and we won't see prices under $6400 again.
But this rise lately has mostly come from shorts squeeze. Whale games again. Not exactly a solid foundation. Especially since those shorts squeezes mostly came out of mistiming. It all started with the ETF announcement coming out earlier than expected and screwing up the timing of shorts. 
I think we need a solid bullish thing to happen to get things re-started, if we want more solid upward runs. I know people are tired of hearing about ETFs, but the VanEck ETF is the nearest thing on the horizon, and it could definitely bring a lot of money into Bitcoin. Or maybe even an SEC reversal on the Proshares decision, if they don't take forever to come to a decision.
Any other potential good news in the next couple months?
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:19:45
There's been a lot of oscillation so if the price stagnates and doesn't go into the high 9Ks or even past 10k within the next few days, then there's a good chance we can briefly revisit the high 8Ks. Why not split your chances, buy half now, and wait and see if you can buy the rest if it goes down. If it doesn't go down, you still bought some in the low 9Ks before it got higher.

Bitcoin is not an investment recommended for the faint of heart or novice investor. It's probably best to first learn investing with classic more stable investments.

There's two issues with the bull run. First, historically it's hard to bounce straight from the bottom to a bull run that quickly, it would require the market to make a u-turn on its sentiments. And there hasn't been any major changes in Bitcoin or in the market to create such a sharp u-turn. 
Second, this run is not fueled by any major good news, or the general public suddenly trusting Bitcoin. It actually started after the bad news with the ETF rejection. Shorts overestimated the weight of this story, it wasn't as big of a deal as they expected, and it got rejected a day earlier than expected, screwing up the timing of their shorts, causing them to liquidate which caused the price to jump. Then in the last couple days we've had 2 more shorts squeezes causing huge green candle spikes within an hour. 
This bull run is completely built on shorts squeezes, with just panic money from the same old players coming back to Bitcoin to save their position. That's not the kind of money I would trust would stay there for too long. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:04:35
Keep in mind, back in April, we were in the $6Ks and rallied into the $9Ks, and dipped right back to a new low. Then in June, same thing again. We were in the lower $6Ks, rallied into the $8Ks, then dipped to a new low in the upper $5Ks. I'm not saying it's gonna happen again, but with Bitcoin, be ready for anything. Historically, we can say we're out of the woods and back in a bull run when we've doubled the low. I'm saving my champagne for $11.8K. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 12:34:45
If it goes below $7k, we might start seeing a lot of panic sell and quickly drop down in the low 6Ks. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:15:36
We've recently had some of the lowest trading volume, and are seeing the price plateauing. This means we're about to see something dramatic. Bitcoin has a rollercoaster-like volatility nature. What's happening is causing tension in its nature, like a spring or rubber band. Bitcoin traders are still there on the sideline, it's the same people with the same habits and the same wildness. The longer they stay idle, the more tension builds in that spring. And when they return, it's gonna be with a bang.
We're about to see either a dramatic rise or a dramatic drop. Historically, Bitcoin has had these stagnant periods right after a crash and a bear market. Typically followed by a very dramatic skyrocketing rise in price when the spring is released. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 14:22:07
If Bitcoin were to fail, there's still a lot of better options than BCH. 
I can think of several alt coins that are more promising, more reliable, and I would trust more than BCH. Anyway, if it were to fail, I think most people would just turn to  ETH. China has even picked ETH as it's first choice already. But maybe by then EOS would have proven itself as an even better choice. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:34:09
Going down is actually a good thing. If we go down into the $7Ks, that means we will go back up after. If we go up now, we're just gonna keep having these dips, and go down.

Bad. It encouraged speculators and investors who are really turning Bitcoin into a security rather than a currency. This has caused a lot of the blockchain related businesses and innovation to focus on catering to them and that market, rather than help improve usability as a currency for people who want to use it to buy their groceries.
Meanwhile adoption as a currency has flatlined. There's hardly been any progress in any usable businesses for the general public to start using Bitcoin to purchase everyday items. How many of your local stores that you use regularly have started accepting Bitcoin? For most people in the world, the answer is still 0. And that's where the focus should have been, building usability so it can become a currency you can use to buy your every day items. From groceries to gas.

Hodling is not gonna make Bitcoin a global currency. More the opposite, you're making it a storage. Frequent usage will help make it a currency.
Also, governments need a currency they can control and print. That's the opposite of what they can do with Bitcoin. Bitcoin was never designed to be a national currency used by governments, it's an alternative to currencies.

In the most optimistic jackpot scenario, where Bitcoin hits $100k, you could potentially turn your $300 into over $4000. That's not bad. In a more realistic scenario, if we hit $20K again, your $300 will turn into $900. So $300 can still have some potential. 
Under $100 it's where it's really pointless. The fees, taxes, etc, will make your meager gains pretty much worthless. Unless your goal is to buy a milkshake from Wendy's. 
Keep in mind there's up-keep fees with Bitcoin. To keep from losing it all in an exchange hack, you'll need at least a hard wallet like a Trezor or Ledger, which I don't think they sell under $100 anymore. You could just use a key on a piece of paper. But that's kind of risky. I would still buy a metal wallet key keeper, than just using a piece of paper, which are also over $100. So that could erase a chunk of your gains. 
Probably anything under $500, you're looking more at short term holding, because you have to keep that somewhere free like an online wallet, which means you're not gonna want it to hang out in there too long. So much less chances of high gains. It's definitely getting more worthwhile when you invest over $1000. But anything in the hundreds of dollars still has some potential.

Long run it's good, it's gonna make people think twice in the future about putting anything into Tether.
But right now it could soon send the price to new lows. Especially if people don't realize what's going on, and think this is a breakout. They'll start opening up stop losses a little higher, and when the price comes back down, it's gonna have more momentum with stop losses and bots.

Bakkt is likely priced in by now (including the money expected to come in). Everyone is already expecting the price to go up. So there would have to be a LOT of money coming in at once right off the bat to make a major impact on the price. Also, any new money coming in is just as vulnerable to the same market forces we see now, the same pump and dumps, and price manipulation. 
What's likely to happen is there won't be that much money coming into Bakkt initially to create that a big spike in price, and in fact the disappointment from the very high expectations may cause it to drop back soon afterwards. But I think in the long run, when Bakkt proves to be successful and attracts more people in, it will start growing, and maybe as early as 2019 we'll start seeing some serious positive effect from Bakkt.

I don't think I've ever seen Bitcoin this flat. If it was flat above $7k I wouldn't mind so much. But it's flat at an uncomfortable level in the low $6Ks, and a little too close to potential new lows. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 17:41:18
I'm still bullish on Bitcoin, but definitely a lot less than I was a year ago. We're still no closer to mass adoption today than we were a year ago. We just have a lot more Bitcoin ATMs now, but still hardly anywhere to use it, or enough people using it. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 04:49:15
While there's no arguing the volume is too thin, and any bad news right now or anything going to shit is easily gonna send this whole market down. I think you have to be a little more realistic. I seriously doubt it would still send Bitcoin below $1k. I think worst case scenario, it might dip very briefly below $4k. But $4k is the ultimate support.
But then again, I said we were unlikely to go below $7k. And if we did, we would only briefly visit $6Ks as support would be too strong there. So I can be a little too bullish sometimes. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 15:39:22
Be careful what you wish for. Sure there's been some manipulation to bring the price down. But right now, a lot of the manipulation is actually to keep the price from sliding. People on Bitfinex are trying to keep the price up with pumps to avoid a potential collapse in this very low volume market, in a period where interest is flat and there's not enough new money coming in.

Volume has hit a serious low. I haven't seen it this flat in a long while. And if you take out the fake volume and wash trading, the real volume is probably still way lower. If it gets any lower, we'll be able to just do pump and dumps with just 3 BTC lol.

Nothing wrong with selling to get back ahead of the game. I kinda regret not having taken some of those obvious opportunities. I'd have at least a couple extra thousand bucks in my pocket, or probably I would have bought now 0.34 btc, and been a little ahead of the game.

I really don't care if Tether collapses. Even if it brings down the price of Bitcoin, it's only gonna be temporarily. People will come back and realize that they should have just stuck to Bitcoin. It might actually be a good thing if Tether collapses. That shit was so shady, and toxic.
@_date: 2018-10-21 23:58:56
My $30K prediction by the end of the year is also not looking too great. Plus now I found out that while Bakkt may be in November, the actual products that can drive the price up are not until December, possibly not until after Christmas. November could be another tough month. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:06:12
Yea but people expect the price to go up on good news, on top of the money coming in. That's the part that's priced in. But really they're relying entirely on what money comes in, since the speculation side is already priced in. That means there would need to be a lot of money depending on the volume to move the price up. If volume stays really low, they may only need a few hundred millions to come in. Is anyone gonna pour that much money into Bakkt right off the bat? But if volume starts coming back to normal levels, there would need to be a little more, which I don't think we'll start to see until 2019.

Understand that people who bought tether in the first place, were doing it to keep their money away from crypto, and into something closest to USD. 
Either they felt things were too bearish right now, or they're just playing some trading games. So it's not a case of them realizing Bitcoin is a better cryptocurrency or anything like that, they didn't want that money in crypto. They'll most likely bring that money to the thing closest to USDT, which is simply USD. They're not moving all their Bitcoins from USDT exchanges to USD exchanges for no reason.

@_date: 2018-10-24 18:12:23
I don't think you understand Bitcoin and how it works. 
It's not the point of Bitcoin to become a national currency. It's the opposite. And governments have no use for Bitcoin as a national currency, they need something they can print and control. The whole point of Bitcoin is to be de-centralized and stay out of the hands of governments. It can be used as an alternative to currencies, or in parallel, but not as a replacement to a country's currency.

These people who are just peddling hopium and false hopes to help raise the price, are probably some of the same people who spread fud to help dumps.

A buddy of mine has a shopify dropshipping online store, and accepts Bitcoin. He's been accepting Bitcoin for almost a year now. So far he's had only 1 payment in Bitcoin. Granted, it was from me as a test. 
I think it's not just the merchants who are resisting Bitcoin, it's more the public. It might still be too new, and maybe it seems too complicated at first for new people. I really thought with exchanges like Coinbase that have really simplified buying Bitcoin, and apps like Mycelium making it super easy to shop, we would have seen a lot more new people coming to Bitcoin. I guess part of it is breaking the habit. People are too used to pulling out their plastic and swiping. Why learn something new, when that has worked for them. I think adoption will take a lot longer than I thought.  
@_date: 2018-10-12 20:02:34

If it wasn't for the money I made last year, I'd be really fucked right now. I can imagine there's a lot of people who weren't so lucky.

Bitcoin is not exactly useful for governments or to replace a national currency. It kinda defies that purpose. I think a cryptocurrency could be used widely for everyday small transactions, like for buying groceries. 
But Bitcoin is probably gonna end up being more of the gold standard of cryptocurrencies. Used as a base for the crypto world, and as personal banking and wealth storage. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 18:22:24


It hasn't. And it keeps getting proven wrong. What markets like the one we've seen in the last year, keeps proving that it's not exactly the best strategy. Especially since most people aren't in this for the last 9 years, so it really doesn't help most people entering the market now. Your argument only works if you've been in the market since nearly the beginning. 
And I'm not just talking about the continual missed opportunities, it's more about how hodl is being sold as a safe strategy. Which is very misleading. The closest thing to a safe strategy is a mix of both a little hodl and long term trading. But nothing is really safe or guaranteed. Being all in with only hodl, is basically putting all your eggs in one basket. With the illusion of doing the same thing as the stock market, except you're not using a diversified portfolio following the S&amp;P 500 or the Dow Jones. So you really have nowhere near that same safety, only the illusion of it.

@_date: 2018-10-15 14:26:42
The simple way you know that it's Tether related and not just a breakout, is simply by the huge amount of Bitcoin that's being transferred away from USDT exchanges into USD, If they were just suddenly bullish and wanted Bitcoin, why would they need to move their recently purchased Bitcoins to non-USDT exchanges?

Every time you think the worst is behind us, and there's clear skies ahead, this damn market finds a new wrench to throw at us. I still don't think this is gonna end with anything at the level of MtGox, but whichever way you cut it, something ugly is brewing here. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 23:10:06
Typically, these big artificial dips are followed by buy-backs and accumulation, and the price is quick to rise back by several hundred dollars, it doesn't normally hover near its low point like this. Is this a lack of volume, or is there still some liquidity problem with exchanges? Or are people feeling like this drop may not be over yet? Why are we still in the low $6k, when there seemed to be a lot of optimism a few days ago about breaking above $6.8k? 
@_date: 2018-10-29 16:08:08
People don't typically like to admit they're wrong, so you're asking for too much here. They'll just try to rationalize it. But the math can't be rationalized. No matter how you cut it, HODL wasn't the ideal approach. It wasn't even the safest. 
You would have made more money with just about any selling at any point when it was over $10K. You didn't even have to sell at ATH. Then bought back at any point under $10K. No need to even time it perfectly or hit the bottom accurately. At a minimum you should have made a little extra cash. But if you were patient, you would have made a killing. No need for any active trading, just two extra transactions. You could then return to your exact same HODL position, but with extra cash in your pocket, and having a little extra guarantee in case things don't pan out. 
Holding long term is a great advice originating from the stock market, when you have a DIVERSIFIED portfolio, that can handle a few bumps on the road. That's because historically, things like the the DOW have always been steadily climbing. It doesn't really apply to a single all eggs in one basket investment like just Bitcoin. That's a much more vulnerable tactic. Plus Bitcoin doesn't have a long enough history you can rely on, and hasn't even hit mass adoption yet. 
I have some long term Bitcoin stashed away, but I'm still making a little profit along the way because you just can't predict what the future holds. Maybe the world will decide to adopt another cryptocurrency instead, or maybe a major vulnerability will be discovered in Bitcoin in a year. I'd rather protect myself. Things may not always pan out like you'd like them to.

I learned to enjoy them, and they're not really that bad.
These dips are just manipulation. They're not signs of anything wrong with Bitcoin. Just enjoy the brief discount on Bitcoin, and play along with the whales for now, and just keep accumulating with each dip. I even started selling half of what I got in each dip, whenever it gets above $6.7k, making a little side cash while building up my stack of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 03:41:52
All signs are pointing to another test of that $6k line. 
Especially with all that Tether uncertainty, and bulls probably not too keen on taking any more risks with every rallies getting erased. At about $6.4k, whales are only about several million dollars worth of Bitcoin away from testing that line again if volume stays low.

Mostly because there's not really anything organic right now or anything caused by market sentiments or news, that would balance things out. It's mostly big whales dropping big bombs, and then things going back to being quiet. And many of those whales are on Bitfinex right now. If you look at the last months. Coinbase was actually lagging behind when the price was dropping fast. Now it's lagging behind with these pumps.
The market is a bit more quiet, and there's not as much money coming in to catch up with those changes.

@_date: 2018-06-20 12:47:17
My predictions are always based on real data, and technical analysis. I've been warning people about Bitcoin not going to just bounce up so soon after a crash and while it's in a bear market. The volume and interest is also really low, so tamper expectations for a while. At the same time, it's unlikely to go below $5.5k, and maybe not even $6k. The $6K bottom has been tested multiple times. A lot of people have been waiting at around $5k, and even $4k to buy in. But they're gonna start losing hope that it will ever get there. This is potentially the last big dip. We may go just a little lower, before we start seeing a steady incline. There's gonna be at least a couple of peaks in that incline, with small dips, before we go back to FOMO and a big bull run to around $30K. Then as always, ecstatic stellar rises are followed by a bubble burst.  Rinse and repeat.

Now I just bought back in at $6005. If it goes up, it's all green for me. If it goes down, I'll buy a little more at $5k. You gotta know when to pull out, and when to cut your losses, so you can get back in the game stronger.
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:42:25
So does that mean it will get below $5k?

@_date: 2017-12-16 21:18:26
But there's no exceptional increases in adoption. Where are your sources for that? It's been pretty flat. Nothing correlating to the spike in price. The price surge is not more people using it for purchases, it's more people hoarding it to sell it later and get rich. 
If you look at the actual transaction rates, it's been going pretty steady, with a steady growth from 200K a day a year ago, to around 400K a day in November. While in that time frame it has doubled, and it's really great, it's definitely no 1,600% rise. There's a glaringly obvious discrepancy here, for people who are willing to look, and not bury their heads in the sand. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:22:59

I thought we definitely hit the bottom, but now it's starting to look like it's just doing the same crap again. 
Getting stuck at around the same price with low volume, then dipping. Then it goes back up a little bit, giving us false hope, gets stuck on low volume for a while, then dips even lower. It's been doing the same crap like clockwork. And it's starting to look like it's about to do the same crap now. That would mean we'll be going down somewhere around $5.5k. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:01:31
There's actually a ton of people in this situation. The losses are in the billions. 
The problem is many people didn't really have a plan for something like this, and didn't know how to manage and cut the losses. Some people invested their savings, and even used mortgages and loans.
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:20:45
With each new dip, it's starting to look like maybe interest in Bitcoin is starting to fade.
Especially since the number of people actually using Bitcoin for retail purchases has flatlined. Usage has gone down (number of confirmed transactions). We've just hit one the lowest usage points. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:19:44


So are you saying people should sell today? Or are you assuming that the price in a few years is automatically gonna have to be higher? The fact is, we only know what the price is today. There's many other strategies that can take advantage of that fact, HODL is not one of them. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 14:21:25
That's true, if people can see that. The problem is I'm not sure if they trust Bitcoin the way we do. There's been so much fud. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:44:48
Cryptocurrencies don't have central banks or governments, so the value doesn't work like FIAT. What value does a digital coin have if it has very little use, very few places where you can use it, or too few people using it?
This is why Bitcoin has an enormous potential. It could be used worldwide by a lot of people. But until people actually use it, and it's accepted at your local stores, or places most people can shop at like Walmart and Amazon, then it's all just potential.

Where is the support? Have people lost faith in Bitcoin or are just scared by the price going down? There doesn't seem to be any kind of big news or change that could stop this free fall. We really need something big to turn all this around. 
How low can it go? Could it theoretically get below $1k? Is that even a possibility now?

I don't even know what to do. Am I gonna regret not having bought cheap Bitcoin for $5.8K when it's at $15k in a few months. Or am I gonna regret not having sold at $5.8K when it's down to $3K in a few months?

If the price doesn't bounce back, that means we're just gonna continue the same pattern. Hover around a price for a while, then dip. It's been doing the same thing over and over. When we actually hit the real bottom, that's when people are gonna jump in and buy in and create a big bounce before most of us get a chance to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:45:12
Again, you're not understanding the separation between Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Bitcoin has its own way of implementing the technology. But not all blockchain based technologies are like Bitcoin.
It's just an efficient and secure way to make consistent records and verify information. The implication is that it uses a network for authentication, so there's less risk of corrupted data or failure from a centralized authentication. Just because we use the term "decentralized" to refer to the database, a lot of people assume that means banks can't use it, because they are often refereed to as centralized but referring to completely different things.
Banks and financial institution can easily use blockchain for their accounting, databases, and transactions internally and externally. Some already have. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:25:41
The rise has nothing to do with any major change in usability. What people surprisingly don't seem to understand, is the price is purely driven by the type of hype and euphoria you're seeing in this very thread. People keep seeing it going up, and see people making huge gains, and want to get in on this. And they see that it hasn't crashed, so they assume it won't crash. It's propped up by this dangerous cycle. Other than that, there hasn't been any significant changes in the Bitcoin world.

Given the history of Bitcoin, there's a good chance it's yet another one of those small dips, especially after hitting the symbolic 10K mark. So there may be a buying opportunity here.
But with the very fast rise in price, with no big news big enough to prop a rise this big, just a euphoria for Bitcoin, there's always the chance of a bubble burst. In the world of investing, don't get too comfortable when something seems to start getting cyclical and predictable, that's when you get blindsided. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:16:11
It's not really a theory here. The sharp rise did come from the big wave, or more like tsunami of people getting in on the action from all the hype. 
There hasn't been any huge change in where it's been accepted. It's risen in acceptance in some places, while losing traction and even being banned in other places. So there hasn't been any exponential sharp rise in place it's being used to match the exponential rise in price. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:08:11
Every time the price jumps ridiculously fast, it only further confirms that there is a bubble. The problem is we don't know how far this euphoria is gonna go. There could still be room to make money. People know so little about Bitcoins and are so misinformed, they could easily go to $20,000 before anyone realizes what's going on. 
But with all these sheep buyers, at any moment if the momentum stops, and major holders start selling, they're probably all gonna follow like sheeps again, and it could get ugly. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:30:28
I think you're the one who doesn't understand the separation between Bitcoin exchange, and blockchain technology. The technology is great, and has a lot of great application. But I think, like most expert predict, when banks and financial institutions adopt cyrptocurrencies, they'll use their own version of blockchain tech. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:52:24
Given what's driving the prices, probably yes, in the short term. The same forces that are driving it up, will probably drive it back down just as fast, someday. And if it crashes too far too quickly, it will probably create fear for bitcoins for a while. So short term, there's probably gonna be a peak point.
The thing is people don't seem to be able to separate bitcoins from blockchain technology. The technology behind it is what's really great, and that's the part that's "the future". Bitcoins could come and go, which doesn't mean it's the end of cryptocurrency. Banks and financial institutions could adopt their own version of blockchain technology. Or they could adopt Bitcoins. So long term, there is a scenario for it to reach a maximum of maybe only $15,000, but there's also a scenario for it to reach into the hundreds of thousands. Given what we know today, the former is more likely. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:00:40
There's a scenario where that's possible, but is it likely? You would not only need to keep the momentum of hype that we see right now, which has been what's driving the price. On top of that you would need some significant adoption and recognition by major financial institutions. This would all have to happen before the same emotional buyers, turn in a panic and become emotional sellers. 
I don't trust emotional buyers, so I would say that's unlikely. If you account the real use and value of Bitcoins, in terms of its use as a currency, how much of it used, the exchange, the technology, and the potential, it's honestly really worth maybe $300 (which is a generous estimate), maybe $1,500 if you're optimistic and see very high potential. The price right now is way off of it's real value. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:06:53
That really shows how volatile Bitcoin is. That could really hurt its usage as a currency. 
The fluctuation happen in such short time that any common delays in business transaction suddenly creates significant changes in price. If you do a refund, you may lose money as a business or as a consumer, returning the same amount of bitcoin from the purchase, but now worth a significantly different value. 
This could start turning businesses off from Bitcoins, if they keep experiencing issues and losses from fluctuating prices. This wouldn't be a huge problem if businesses could rely solely on Bitcoins for all their expenses, from acquiring inventory, to paying employees, to paying taxes. Which won't happen any time soon.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:20:23
It could be just a correction, or it could be the start of a big sell off. 
You have to decide. Do you want to cut your losses short, or risk losing a lot for the chance of getting back in profit territory.
Given what's been propping the price (hype and euphoria over getting rich off Bitcoins), I would lean towards hold, because there hasn't been any news that would change that mindset. Unless those people on the hype train really have no spine and panic over this price setback. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:17:44
That would make it even more sensitive to market changes, and make it more likely to continue to increase in price.

Wanna be trader? LOL
I passed my Series 7, briefly worked as a stockbroker. I grew up in stock trade (my dad was a stock broker, now he owns an investment firm). Son, I've been in this game since I was a little kid. 
How was I skinned alive? I quadrupled my money. Greedy people like you who don't know when to back down, don't understand the difference between trade/gamble/investment, eventually get burned. I've seen many people like you come and go in all my years. 
If you're so rich, why are you so angry though?
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:40:59
I think a lot of people's disappointment in Bitcoin stems from the assumption that it was guaranteed it would go up. If it was always generally going up, then surely it will always go up. If it hit $20K then surely it will hit $20K again. It's not necessarily gonna work like that. Even if it succeeds in its adoption.
In the world of investment, nothing is guaranteed. The second you think you have something figured out, is the second it will do the exact opposite of what you were expecting.
Bitcoin itself is not a guaranteed thing yet. There's no mass adoption yet, and the general public is still very cautious and a bit fearful of it, and they've now had a decade to jump on board. Plus if they eventually embrace cryptocurrency, who's to say they won't embrace another crypto? They might seek something faster and cheaper, or a better alternative might pop up along the way in the next year. Nobody knows for sure. I personally love Bitcoin and the tech, but who's to say everyone else will see things the same way I do.
Even if Bitcoin gets adopted, it's not guaranteed the price is gonna "moon". It's a possibility, but there's a lot of other possible scenarios. Remember how the introduction of futures contracts created this counter-force to the price of Bitcoin. With mass adoption, you may also see an increase of counter forces, maybe some put in place on purpose to keep Bitcoin more stable and more useful so the price doesn't fluctuate. Since mass adoption is more likely to work with a more stable price, in order for Bitcoin to succeed, it may have to stop shooting up and fluctuate wildly, and not "moon". 
Just keep your mind open to other possible scenarios, so you don't get surprised, and most of all don't get burned when it doesn't go your way. This is by no means meant to be bearish talk. I'm still a believer in Bitcoin. You can be hopeful and bullish, and still keep an open mind about bearish possibilities.

The only thing stored or kept safe is the private key.

The Binance news was debunked within the same day. It was just bullshit. Literally within hours. The child porn was received with a lot of skepticism, because most people didn't understand how it could possibly be linked. Plus at the same time there was the Carney news and several other positive news that should have balanced it out. 
Also the dips haven't coincided with the timing of those stories. There just hasn't been any significant fud recently. This is just people having doubts and sentiments of uncertainty. Investors are just losing faith with the steady tumble from 19K since December. The faith they gained when Bitcoin made a meteoric rise from 3k to 19K. These are the kinds of rises people who jumped on Bitcoin recently were expecting.

Honestly, I'd be impressed if it ever gets into the $40Ks. I would just pull out. That would actually be an insanely high market cap. To get any higher than $50k, it would mean all 700 alt coins would have to fail as cryptocurrencies, and that's some very bad odds to bet against. 
It's still possible for Bitcoin to reach $100K some day, but what people don't understand, is that once you reach really high market caps, it won't rise as quickly as it did in the past when we were dealing with much smaller caps. To go from $50k to $100K might take over 10 years. Technology changes too quickly for me to believe that people will still be using only Bitcoin by that time. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:03:06
I use a spreadsheet, but that's because I want to customize it. There's a lot of information you need to remember to put on there, most importantly what each transaction is worth in USD, and what the rate was at the time. You also need to remember to have a column for the combined gains or loss of a transaction, and keep a separate note or column of how you got to that sum, and where those gains originate from. You also need to keep track of where the Bitcoin you are using originally were purchased from (as in from what original purchase and date and rate). If you use just $200 worth of Bitcoin to buy some Cardano, out of $1000 worth of Bitcoin you bought 3 months ago, you have to keep track that you have $800 left from that purchase, and know you originally bought the Bitcoin at the rate from 3 months ago, and you have now a new rate. 
But really the important thing is to know what all your transactions were worth in USD.
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:54:45
$7k is actually still relatively expensive if you think about it. Remember just a year ago, Bitcoin was still under $1k. Even if it drops all the way down to $2k it would have doubled in 1 year, that's a huge price increase.

That's what I've always been saying. The best strategy is not to go all HODL or all day trade. But use a combination of strategies. Right now with these big swing in prices, there's a LOT of money to be made. I've been averaging $2000 a week for the last couple months. If all your Bitcoin money is in HODL, you're missing big. But it's good to keep a portion of your coins in HODL mode, in case there's a big bright future for Bitcoin down the road. But if there's not, HODLing alone would have been a big waste.

Maybe because some of those alt-coins have promising working models and technology that solves a lot of the problems of cryptocurrency, and don't have some of the drawbacks of Bitcoin. They're just too new and haven't proven themselves yet. But if some of these next gen coins work the way they're supposed to, they could be the next step in the evolution of cryptocurrency. Technology always evolves. Why not keep some leverage to stay on top of potential changes?

If anything, what happened in the last couple months only shows that hodl doesn't really work. 
If you hodl'd you not only saw more than half of your gains disappear, but on top of that, if you believe Bitcoin will rise back and go to the moon you could have bought back at low prices and set yourself up for even more gains. When you hodl you just miss huge opportunities.

This has all the hallmarks of the $9K rally, which dipped back into $5.8K. I really hope it's just a coincidence and not history repeating itself. But everything looks eerily similar. Especially with the way the volume has moved, and out of the blue a spike that doesn't look very organic. There also hasn't been any significant changes or major news to warrant a reversal. And it seems to be just the same forces at play again. I'm not saying there's price manipulation, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was.
I really hope I'm wrong, and I'm only being paranoid. But I would honestly advice not to do anything drastic yet. Don't put all your life savings in, we may not be out of the woods yet.
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:50:51
The price is not down, it's exactly where it should be! Before the price started it's insane exponential unnatural rise, we were sitting at about $3k (already up from $1k from just a few months before). 
It started to double fairly quickly at a faster rate than usual, and reached $6k. This was due to very positive outlook and the great potential in the long run. Then it hit $8k. At that point, justifying that price was becoming a bit of a stretch, but you could make the argument that Bitcoin had a really bright future and huge potential. 
When it went above that, that became just insanity, and it was hard to find logic and reason for the rise anymore and for that high a price. There was no change in the technology, or usage. 
So really $6-8K is a very reasonable price, it's where we were before we lost reason and logic, and this is where we are back now, because that's really where Bitcoin should be

It wasn't a bad assumption. There's a possibility of a price tumble. The guy is gonna have to sell millions in Bitcoin sooner or later, because the court won't accept Bitcoin as compensation.

Even in a good case scenario where Bitcoin shoots back above $18k, after the fees and taxes, you're really just gonna make about $40. And that's assuming you can time it right. 
Honestly, anything that's not in the thousands, or at least close to a thousand if it's an alt coin, is probably not worth it. It's not worth the time, paperwork, and tax headache. Plus in most cases you'll have to either pay someone to help with taxes, or use the more expensive version of turbotax and even in that case it's better to pay for a little expert advice, rather than get fucked by the IRS. That might end up eating up most of your gains, if you're just dealing with small numbers.

I remember this time in here last year. We were all arguing as to what the price would be by the end of 2018. Some said it would only go up to $40K and be branded fudsters lol. Most said easily above $50k, and the general consensus was probably past $100k, if not by the end of 2018, then definitely sometime in 2019. And there was a lot of debate as to whether $1Million was also a possibility.  
And look at where we are now. Crossing our fingers that it won't drop below $3k. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:54:29
We could be looking at a double bounce in price in the upcoming days. Seeing as shorts are near an all time high, this breakout could cause shorts to get squeezed and collapse, creating another big spike in price. And with shorts being that high, it could be a pretty dramatic squeeze that could take us above $4K. 
And that could have a bit of a domino effect on the market. Causing kind of a reverse panic, with everyone rushing to close out their shorts, and accumulating before the price breaks out higher.

I've heard a lot of different numbers about the minimum price of Bitcoin for the block rewards to be profitable. The highest was at something like $5K and lowest around $2K. So right now, probably a lot of miners aren't doing too great with the price at $3K. But that doesn't mean they have to shut down. And even if they do, fewer competing miners means the remaining miners will have a better chance at hitting those block rewards. And if it becomes less competitive, it's just gonna bring in new miners. 
Also, keep in mind that since those numbers have been estimated, miners have found new ways to cut their costs and save on energy. This is just gonna be a survival of the fittest scenario. The miners who can cut their costs the most are the ones who will survive.
