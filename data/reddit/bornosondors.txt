Bitcoin monetary policy is even less elected.
It was decided by one person years ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:36:23
I love that people here hate on Fed monetary policy
While Bitcoin monetary policy is completely centralized, arbitrary, non-elected, comes from nowhere. Why is it the way it is? Why are the parameters like they are? Why is the  halving the given speed? Because Satoshi decided that way one day.

Make it crash and burn
Make people cry
Make the blood go through the streets and all the crypto shills lose their houses and cars
The Great Flood is coming, and it will wipe away all the crypto sins

Nobody uses bitcoin for actual payments.
Everyone just buys and waits for the price to rise to later sell.
Nobody pays with bitcoin anything. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:42:17
But you small block people WANTED THIS!
@_date: 2017-03-14 23:26:01
How is that different from current situation? Miners can do this now, too. Or I don't understand something. Wallets switch to longer chain all the time. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 04:10:35
How would core deal with a bug like this. 
It's necessary to make a quick update, how would bitcoin handle this? 
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:57:27
you were not here during mtgox, were you
@_date: 2016-06-17 21:24:44
That's different. That was a bug in the bitcoin protocol. It's clear what Bitcoin should be doing, and it was not doing that. 
Here, Ethereum is doing what it should be doing. But they will change the underlying logic, so that one contract will change its logic, because some people stopped liking that. 
But in the end it's on miners. I hope miners will be against hard fork, for the good of ethereum, but it's their choice. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 21:26:36
It's not bug in the ethereum though, it's bug in contract that should theoretically be independent on ethereum, but ethereum will fork so DAO funds can be saved. 
It's really more akin to changing protocol rules to revert Mt. Gox funds than fixing bugs in the code.

PGP signatures of the Satoshi's e-mails with Satoshi privkey would be enough to shut up people. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 04:35:42
BTC-E? That doesn't exist anymore, dude
@_date: 2018-06-07 02:07:22
I would agree 3 years ago maybe 
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:22:11
Ummmm some core developers were advocating for *smaller* blocks. There you have them. 
No really, miners can mine how many txs they want in a block. Fee market everyone. Ant is not doing any attack or anything against the protocol. Sabotage implies attack; there is no attack here. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 02:08:09
Lightning Network will surely fix everything 
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:30:25
Eh bitcoin was under 6k for most of its existence
Only now we see real correction from the last year's bubble. Now we have to wait and see what happens when all the people that are in bitcoin just as an investment tool get out and sell, and we will see what is its *real value* - real fundamental value - how many people actually need uncensorable digital money.
It won't go down to 0, but it can go even to 4k. If everyone sells
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:40:39
You think this is red.... crash after MtGox was red.
This is just a little pink
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:52:50
Look at the bright side, it can't keep crashing for much lower. With the current movement, 6 months tops and we are at 0, at it can't go below that. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:21:04
We are coming! And we are coming in waves!
I can finally be financially independently!
Below 5800!
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:48:14
Yeah the bubble finally popped, now we are finding actual demand for the tech outside of get-rich-quick investors
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:44:15
Price cannot go below zero. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:31:39
For all the talk about decentralization this and decentralized that, bitcoiners surely love their centralized social media platforms.
At least it's not Facebook. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:44:39
If bcash is 500 k in 3 years and Bitcoin isn't, I will eat my own dick.
...no I probably won't. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:32:18
Proof that decentralization doesn't really work
@_date: 2017-04-27 18:24:11
Why? 
@_date: 2018-11-02 04:09:33
All these crypto-utopia-lands usually end up in the same way - people starting scamming each other and nothing coming out of it.
All the Liberlands and Galt's Gulches end up the same way
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:12:08
I will try that, once it's out of beta.
v1 seemed like alpha when I tried it.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:15:14
Bitcoiners like to see themselves as the Di Caprio character
In reality, they are the ones that he scammed
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:35:51
I don't understand
What do you want to open source on bitpay. The main issue is always liquidity, regulatory requirements (KYS etc), cold storage of bitcoins, you cannot really open source that. Those are processes.
@_date: 2017-09-30 10:45:06
Don't believe the hype.
OpenBazaar v1 is basically unusable and thus, nobody is actually using it.
v2 is in beta.
@_date: 2017-09-26 18:56:22
I understand the intent, but what I am saying the hard part of being Bitpay is not the software, but having liquidity and regulatory processes right. But maybe I misunderstood what is the intent 
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:42:39
Federal banks print money, bitcoiners just make 20 hard forks 
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:30:22
Basically is bullshitting here
What they say in the media or how they edit the commits is not a copyright infringement. They included the attribution, as MIT license requires
Rest of the github issue is a retarded back and forth.
I don't like bcash but claims about copyright infringement are laughable. And stupid.
@_date: 2018-07-08 18:14:16
Yes, it was mentioned.
By a criminal.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:12:27
I'm from Europe, not US, but most ultra-rich I know ride BMW or Audi
Which is not a fucking Lambo or Ferrari but is is also not Toyota

Nope, Sinclair is very specifically pro Trump. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 10:34:46
Sinclair Media Group.
They control large part of US local media and force them to do pro-Trump messages (such as this one)

You forget the one essential truth of this sub. 
**Absolutely everything** is **always** good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:15:13
Palestine is tiny, but it's still bigger than current Bitcoin economy. Litecoin will have exactly the same scaling issues if people will actually use it. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:09:14
We have a fee market now, you see the results 
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:02:32
Not really, people need to upgrade to segwit wallets and segwit addresses and the whole infrastructure, meanwhile with large blocks, it works with current transactions current software current wallets, right now. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:36:34
If people don't upgrade, they don't use segwit and have no gain. You need to upgrade to have p2wpkh-inside-p2sh address which is necessary for segwit (as of now) 
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:31:40
Well yeah, that's how bitcoin was designed.

Shitting on Ver/Jihan will *always* be upvoted, no matter of truth value.
Truth is not important. Emotions are the truth.
