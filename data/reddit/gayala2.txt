It’s a start to get into bitcoin. The money will go up and down with the value of BTC.  But only certain amounts of investments should be kept on coinbase. If you’re gonna buy a full coin, then you have to transfer it to a private wallet.

Coinbase is an exchange. Not a wallet. If you’re going to buy large amounts, then Coinbase is your friend. but you need to get either a Wallet on a separate app or a hardware Wallet (preferred) 
If you’re gonna invest small increments, then keep them in coinbase so you can track it.

I’m not the guy who said he’ll eat his own ball when BTC hit 10K

 I personally like coinbase although the 10 day wait is a bummer. But at least you’ll have whatever bitcoin is worth in 10 days. Patience is key

I don’t know honestly. They just types satoshi in their App Store.

It’s just waiting. There’s literally thousands of people trying to get confirmed. You’re probably just on que; mine said denied for hours, later it was confirmed

Then it’s gonna be a while before anything happens. Usually 10 days for a large transaction. You should of gotten an email saying when the funds will deposit. And you’re probably gonna get credited soon on your account. It’s different with each bank

Thank you

You shall prove them wrong once day. I would suggest buying fractions of bitcoin &amp; lite coins. Don’t be afraid of dips. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:15:56
Through what resources? I plan on buying the same ones 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:09:17
You’re gonna be in for a wait. There’s thousands of users trying to get verified.  I went through the same process, hodl on my friends. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:35:12
It’ll take about 10 days. You get an mail confirming when the bitcoin will deposit onto your bitcoin account 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:46:09
You can just wait it off. Here’s was spike in users cause of thanksgivings. But just beware cause coinbase Is in though lawsuits with the government. As soon as you get your coins, move them.

Shit was hectic for a moment omg 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:38:41
As a college student, I feel that to the core of my soul. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:38:54
Did you buy with your bank or card? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:25:11
Probably nice hash hAs a problem, are you mining on CPU Or GPU
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:45:04
Try coinbase since it’s traditionally easy; other than that, experienced bitcoiners would say just set up a private wallet and keep track of all transaction IDs along the road. That’s just me, someone can say other wise. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:12:14
Same here, I’m pissed

The money will increase as it has since its birth, we’ll see over time. Although there will never be inflation nor deflation. It is worth what it is worth.
