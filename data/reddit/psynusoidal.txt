Of course. 
Additionally, trying to impose these types of regulation shows political borders for what they truly are: enslavement and arbitrary control structures.

Yes, so you'd get the value your bitcoin is worth, or your gold. It doesn't matter if it costs more to replace that asset now than at the time of theft, 1 btc is still 1 btc and it needs to be returned in full.
It's not any more or less convenient than figuring out the replacement value for any other asset.

They don't have to listen to us. Bitcoin exists, and no amount of willful ignorance will change that fact. Idealism is abstract, it can be ignored, but a concrete invention that people use cannot.
Further, no amount of regulation can magically fix problems. No amount of regulation would have stopped gox's coins from being lost or stolen, and no amount of regulation would make them magically reappear or allow gox to reimburse their customers. And at the end of the day, theft and fraud are still theft and fraud, and no regulation needs to be introduced to make that so.
All further regulation will do is decrease competition, increase barriers to entry, and make things worse than they already are, as we've seen time and time again, most recently with Vault of Satoshi's announcement that they will no longer be serving US customers.
And beyond all that, we're talking about a global phenomenon. What would US regulations do about an exchange in Japan owned by a French citizen? You're still thinking in old-world terms. Bitcoin destroys all notions of political borders, it truly does not fit into our current societal paradigm. Time to move on.

You don't understand how bitcoin works. Transactions are denominated in atomic base-units, which is currently the satoshi. If we were to "divide" further, it would mean introducing more base-units, or tokens that are available on the network. I don't care if it's relative to your own holdings, it's still introducing a larger number of atomic base-units to the network. It's not division.

Depends entirely on the motives of whoever purchases them. They could very well be swooped up by an asset management firm such as SecondMarket or Fortress to back a bitcoin fund for cheap.

@_date: 2014-01-03 04:14:48
I'm not into mainstream science, which is why this thread is turning into a huge clusterfuck. That's the whole thing I'm trying to get at. Using "well mainstream science says!" is not an effective argument for me when what I'm saying is that mainstream science is tautological and mislead. I know what mainstream science says. I come from a STEM background. I used to have blind faith in it as well, until I realized that none of it actually matched with my own personal experience of the world, and that it couldn't even begin to explain why I even experience the world in the first place!
Certain *effects* are understood well enough to make them do things. We understand what the *effects* of gravity are and can use that to make shit that relies on the pull of gravity. What we don't understand is *what causes gravity*. Best guess so far? Some magical fucking particle called a graviton. Another wonderful, purely hypothetical invention just like dark matter, dark energy, tachyons, the weak force, the strong force, blah blah blah. Mysterious, unexplained particles and forces all the way down. Science as it stands today, is completely obsessed with the physical world of *effect*, and it completely discounts the world of *cause*. Not just pushes cause aside to look at later, but instead completely denies the existence of cause at all. Science denies consciousness. It denies personal experience. It ignores the fact that everything we perceive happens in our minds, not outside of us.
What I'm getting at, is that our understanding of cause in the universe is non-existent. And without understanding the deeper mechanics of the universe, then they're never going to understand what they're looking at when they observe the effects they call "quantum mechanics" (which funny enough, is starting to make scientists realize they can't keep ignoring consciousness, because of the pesky "observer" problem). Consciousness and reality are inseparable, and that's the fatal mistake we've made in our modern way of thinking. There is no physical. **Everything physical exists in the mind**, and the mind is the creator. That's why something needs an observer in order to exist. Consciousness is cause.
Electricity and magnetism are one. Light does not travel. The universe is a fractal. It's like a double-torus in a mirror cube. You're going to keep hearing that more and more. That the universe is a "hologram". That it has "super-symmetry", that it's a "crystal". That it's a "computer". These are all true, and I can even show you how mathematics, geometry and numbers themselves are a part of this. Did you know that our number system is actually symmetrical? Did you know that the geometry of the number system forms a perfectly balanced torus that is completely interlaced with phi and can perform all arithmetic functions simultaneously? Well it is. And it does.

These seized coins are already "priced in." Them changing hands doesn't change anything if their availability is never public. The equilibrium remains unchanged.

If I didn't have to fork over unnecessary information to comply with bullshit regulation I wouldn't have had to deal with this same problem over and over. The solution *is not* handing over *even more* information to eventually be stolen. And it's never regulation in the case of identity fraud, it's typically AML/KYC bullshit, or proof of citizenship.
Data breaches happen all the time, it's never big news. Eventually you will also get a cute little letter in the mail informing you that someone jacked your shit, but don't worry, because they're giving you a free 1 year subscription to a credit monitoring service as reconciliation.

It's token inflation. It's not functionally the same. There are now more atomic units available on the network. It's an important distinction.

The traditional systems already offer ease of transactions and they're all already digital. The entire point of the blockchain is that it makes decentralization possible and it amounts to nothing but unnecessary overhead if you intend to use it in a centralized system. Why bother mining their own blocks when they can simply shuffle values around in a database?
Further, most roadblocks banks put up that make transactions a hassle are due to policy, not lack of technology. There's no reason this would change if they decide to start using a different ledger scheme.
You're also making a lot of assumptions about what people do and don't care about. Gold can be a hassle because it's not particularly liquid while bitcoin has the advantage of being a quickly and easily transferable store of value. There's also a great many people on this earth who don't have to be wearing tinfoil hats to be distrustful of the banking system, and you need to look no further than the many places on earth currently going through financial crises to understand why people might want a store of value that exists outside of "the system".

Of course they control slaves, it's just that the concept of a slave has become more abstract. Instead of making you labor directly for them, they simply tax the labor and trades in which you voluntarily participate. If you do not pay these taxes you will be put in a cage. If you resist being put into a cage, physical violence will be used against you. Do not confuse indirect labor with freedom.
You are not free to leave this system. In order to renounce citizenship you must find a new owner willing to take you, pay an exit tax (in other words, buy your "freedom", or really pay for your own trade), and get the government's permission. They can deny your renunciation if they so please. Make no mistake, you are owned, you are property.

In my mind the goal is not to model reality. To model something is to approximate it. The goal is to understand reality. The goal is to be able to derive effect from understanding how effect unfolds from cause.
If you are looking at the universe in terms of large and small and using different sets of rules to describe them, then you slipped up somewhere. The distinction is so utterly arbitrary and just screams that we're missing something. Just because we have equations to describe the physical behaviors doesn't really give us any understanding of the system. It's like looking at a shadow of an octagon that's oriented in such a fashion that the shadow it casts looks like a square or a cube. You can describe all this stuff about the shadow and come up with all these square rules that seem to describe the thing you're seeing, but when you realize you're looking at a shadow of an an object that's actually an octahedron, all of a sudden your rules are basically irrelevant. This is the type of situation I believe that we are in.
Scientists need to realize that they are focusing on a shadow and not the thing that is casting the shadow.

This is my primary contention with science as it stands. Its unhealthy obsession with matter and its outright denial of consciousness and subjective experience. When you understand that all that exists is *mind*, the paradox you describe no longer exists, because we're no longer talking about a world of matter, but a world of mind.
The universe is a fractal object. It is a holographic liquid crystal display made up of mind stuff.

Listen to yourself. What you're essentially arguing is that bitcoin doesn't work. Huh, fancy that.
Yeah, look at us with our awesome internet money! It's totally way better than the traditional financial systems, except that it's too much trouble to use, so we're just going to make an entrenched system that's identical to the current system but offers no real benefits and all of the same problems (and then some)! BITCOIN!!!111 WOOO!!!! And by the time it does take off (if ever), it'll be TOO. FUCKING. LATE. You had a chance at a clean start and YOU FUCKING BLEW IT. I am going to take so much pleasure in watching this precarious house of cards you idiots managed to build yourselves out of a beautifully decentralized system collapse.

I don't put much (read: any) weight into the actual Nobel Peace Prize either, but my point was that the Nobel prize for economics isn't actually a Nobel prize. Moreover, it is a prize created and funded by an organization entrenched in the keynesian system, so go figure they'd give Krugman a pat on the back.

Funny thing is I don't even give a fuck if doge is successful or not (it won't be). I just hate meme culture. It's that simple. I hate banal bullshit being pumped into the collective consciousness. It is toxic. Of course, you simple old-world thinkers can't comprehend what I'm getting at here.

The religion of Scientism doesn't like that very much, as it goes against their core tenent that reality is some objective thing that is fundamentally separate from conscious experience.
Scientists are good at collecting data. They are not good at making good sense of it once collected.

No, you misunderstood me.
My point was that just because a theory may *describe* some phenomena does not mean that it is correct. My theory is great when coins land on heads, just as quantum mechanics is great when talking about sub-atomic particles (if there even is such a thing). But everything falls apart when the coin lands on tails, just as quantum mechanics does when you want to talk about planets.
What does this mean? That both relativity and quantum mechanics are wrong. They are mutually exclusive, and neither accurately describes everything. There's no other logical conclusion to come to. They are incorrect. Period.
The theory of something must explain that something. Currently *nothing* in physics is explained. The fundemental forces and particles are 100% mysterious and everyone seems to be ok with that for some reason.

You're misrepresenting what I'm saying. I think computing will be advanced, but they are currently going down the wrong path that won't yield much fruit. At the end of the day, these things are just glorified guess and check machines with impressive sounding words associated with them.
If they want to see the real computational nature of reality, I can show them (or you), but people are generally too stuck in their current modalities to understand what I'm talking about. Not that people tend to understand quantum computing either, but people put too much false authority into myopic academics and take their word for everything.
Really, though. How are we supposed to take anything "quantum" seriously? It's in direct contradiction with general relativity. Neither quantum mechanics nor general relativity sufficiently explain everything. So, two contradicting theories, both of which are inadequate on their own. What can we glean from these facts? That both quantum mechanics and general relativity are *wrong*, as is any "knowledge" that follows from using them as axioms in your reasoning.

Mind, consciousness, I use them interchangeably. It's the thing that experiences. The self. It is *cause*.
It's not made of anything, everything is made of *it*. It's not physical. It's still magnetic white light. It's the infinite fractal *thing*.
Matter, anything "physical". The thing is, and this is where people have it backwards, consciousness creates the physical. Physical things ("matter") are your thoughts. The physical world is in your mind. Do you get it? It's your own internal projection. Your mind is not in your body, your body is in your mind.

Anyone who puts faith into both relativity and quantum mechanics has no business telling me that my ideas are laughable. You're a walking contradiction and you understand nothing of reality or its nature.
Here, check out my theory: When a coin is flipped it will always land on heads. It's right half of the time, so it's useful and successful at predicting many observed physical phenomenons. It must be correct.
You want to know the truth? The universe is a fractal (I think the only guys who are prodding at this in academia are the m-theory guys, but I'm not sure). Any theory that doesn't take this into account is incorrect, and is instead just a rough approximation and description of the behavior of some physical effect, *not* a unified theory and it is not understanding.

Allow me to make things easier for you:




No agreement has been voluntarily entered. No meeting of the minds has been reached, and the terms of this supposed "contract" certainly vary. There is no contract.
I did not enter a contract simply because a particular set of values has been violently imposed upon me.

If it's unfalsifiable then it's not science. Of course, that's what science has wholly turned into. A dogmatic belief system that is completely indisputable. It is a religion.
No matter how you want to define it, quantum and classical mechanics are both inaccurate. If they're inaccurate then they're wrong. They are not explaining reality. Time to throw them out and start over.
I'm not sure how to describe VBM succinctly. It's basically the idea that the fundamental archetype in the universe is the vortex (specifically a double-torus, or two intersecting opposed vortices). It's the [geometry]( you see everywhere. Two opposing poles with an accretion disk surrounding the center null-point. A magnetic field. Everything in the universe can be explained in terms of vortices and vortex motion (waves). Even our number system forms one of these vortices. Just google around if you want to find out more. You'll love it if you're into mathematics, geometry or number theory at all (as VBM marries all three of these).

Quantum computers will be remembered as nothing but a novelty used to secure grant money and inflate egos, just like the LHC and every other useless and costly "experiment" these ungrounded eggheads are carrying out under the guise of "Science™".
The problem with our contemporary "scientists" is that they can't think clearly. Their entire approach is wrong, their entire view of the universe is skewed. So they collect a bunch of data only to go on and misinterpret because their cultural filters fuck up their ability to reason about the data they've collected and the system they're analyzing. This then just leads to further misunderstandings and false premises, sending them chasing their tails down a rabbit hole of irrelevant nonsense completely divorced from reality.

I disagree. It does make them wrong. If they aren't right, then they are wrong. It's that simple. There's no being half-right when you're trying to talk about universal theories. All you've got is a thing that happens to approximate some behavior we observe, not a theory and certainly nothing that explains the causal processes of the effects we're observing.
Further, any theory that doesn't take consciousness or fractal geometry (the geometry of nature) into account from the get go is a non-starter as far as I'm concerned. I propose that Vortex-Based Mathematics is the most accurate theory that we have.

I'm not misinformed. You don't understand decentralization or why it's important. It's doesn't matter if bitcoin is a decentralized network layer when you build centralized services on top of it to make it useful. It's the wrong frame of mind. Bitcoin requires a different kind of thinking and it is wholly incompatible with the status quo in every possible way. Conforming to the status quo and our current culture of centralization will be the end of bitcoin, and we are moving full speed ahead in that direction.
Bitcoin is going to be fucked in the same exact way the internet is fucked now, because the ISPs are centralized. Doesn't matter how great TCP/IP is when the infrastructure on top of it is controlled by stupid fucking humans with stupid fucking agendas.
Don't worry. I'll be here to laugh right in your dumb cunt face when bitpay gets served.

Because it is becoming defacto centralized through services such as bitpay and coinbase. What easier way to compromise the entire fucking network than by slapping the centralized, US-based services with mandates? It's a totalitarian's wet dream.
My qualm is not with bitcoin. Bitcoin has the potential to be great. I hold a significant amount of btc. My problem is with short-sighted old-world thinkers who are stuck in the mentality of centralized systems. The whole point of bitcoin is to GET THIRD PARTIES OUT FROM IN BETWEEN YOU IN YOUR MONEY. These idiots are trying their damnedest to reintroduce those same exact players back in between you and your money. It's absolute insanity, especially with all that has come to light about what governments are doing right now. We need to be running away from centralized services as fast as humanly possible. If you don't understand this then you do not understand bitcoin.

The state of the art being that quantum computers are bullshit. As you've said, D-Wave isn't exactly one and it doesn't do much, and the others are, well, non-existent.
And no, I don't "deny" quantum physics wholesale exactly. What I claim is that they're misunderstanding what it is they're observing. There's a difference.
The effects are they observe real, but they are only seeing a part of the picture. Their explanations for those effects are what I claim is incorrect, and will inevitably hinder their ability to engineer these systems, or advance our technology in general. Lets be honest, we've been more or less spinning our wheels for the past 100 years. We haven't really discovered much new in physics since we figured out how to harness electricity (and we *still* don't do a very good job of that). There's a reason we're not moving forward, and it's because we're on the wrong path.
It would do you well to understand what my criticisms actually are before trying to project beliefs onto me. Instead you, just like everyone else, has a knee-jerk reaction the moment I challenge authority and you make all sorts of assumptions about what it is I think. Just like how most of the world marginalizes bitcoiners whenever they challenge Bernanke, Greenspan or Krugman.

That doesn't really matter much when you have a monopoly on bitcoin merchants. Paypal doesn't monopolize the dollar, but they still manage to stop it from flowing, don't they?
Bitpay has over 15k merchants signed up with them. What happens when their bank account gets frozen? What happens when they get served an injunction? It's a huge single point of failure.
Further, you're opening yourself up to all sorts of corruption ala visa and paypal. Bitpay can easily start cutting off merchants for any reason, political or otherwise.  And just wait until they get in bed with coinvalidation.
Bitpay is also actively destroying privacy. They have the addresses of both the customer and the merchant. They have the customers personal information, such as name and address, because they are handling the invoicing for the merchant. Making a purchase from a bitpay merchant is absolutely compromising your identity on the bitcoin network.
It's a perfect storm of shit fuckery and it's going to take all of you oblivious idiots by surprise (although it shouldn't be surprising at all). Don't say I didn't warn you.

Yes, it does. It applies to just about everything. Basically what happens is they poke and prod at some phenomenon until they're able to explain its *behavior* to some extent and then engineer some system that take advantage of this perceived behavior. What this leads to is extremely inefficient systems because they don't understand the *cause* of the phenomenon, so they're never able to use them to their full advantage. It's why we have an extremely lossy power transmission system. It's why we have radio interference all over the place. For instance, I bet that 99% of people (even electrical engineers) think that electricity is actually carried through a wire, which is not the case, as it is actually carried in the space around the wires (just look at a [leyden jar]( if you don't believe me). The idea that it flows through wires is "good enough" but it's still a fundamental misconception that leads to electricity being used incorrectly or inefficiently, and takes us further down the path of not understanding the *actual* behavior of electricity, and by extension, the universe.
Basically they see that there are some "gears" of reality spinning around, and that they can design something that meshes with those gears to make something that seems sort of cool. What they don't understand, however, is why those gears are there, what they're made out of, how they're connected, or what's making them turn in the first place. Understanding this allows for much greater engineering possibilities, but instead they convince themselves that the gears *are* the fundamental primitives and that they have it all figured out, leaving us in a world of shitty inefficient technology.

No increase in pressure doesn't equal downward pressure.

Yes, I suppose this is true. If there's ever a group of people who btc would resonate with, it's burners. I dunno, it's just a personal hang up I guess, something just rubs me the wrong way about getting my head in the money space while at such events. I go out to the desert to get away from all of that stuff so that I can simply just exist.
As far as "BM itself becoming MOOPy" I meant that the burn is sort of becoming a caricature of itself. It's become so much of an institution with an established culture of its own that it's almost something to rebel against in its own right ;). I feel it's become quite ego-fueled lately with a lot of people carrying an "I'm more burner than you" sort of attitude.

Yes, because none of them are figuring anything out. It's fruitless. It's a waste of time and money.


Then they better fuck off with their theories, because descriptions of effect don't make for theories. This is exactly what my point was, that they're good at collecting data but not at understanding it. Yet these fools are the ones who get to dictate how everything works and I get called a crank if I suggest that they may not be interpreting their information correctly.
These people aren't testing hypotheses anymore. They just keep inventing more and more unexplainable, untestable shit to explain their untestable, unexplainable shit. And when they do test something and the numbers don't work out how they expected them to, instead of trashing their failed hypothesis like a good scientist, what do they do? They invent more untestable, unexplainable shit! Hello dark matter! HELLO RESEARCH GRANTS AND EXPENSIVE TOYS!
Modern science has turned into a religion, plain and simple. It is a belief system and they will never allow for their precious idol, the standard model, to be disproved despite the ever-growing mound of [anomalies](


It does if they ignore consciousness, which they do. It does if they ignore the fractal geometry of nature, which they do. Consciousness is *key*. Fractals are *key*. We can't ignore the existence of these things. They are here. Open your eyes.
There are other theories out there that do explain the hows and the whys, and do account for consciousness and fractal geometry. Some of them are also based on (or corroborated by) much more modern discoveries, especially in plasma physics, which was just in its infancy when Einstein came along and fucked everything up. We need to be putting time and effort into those, not this broken, patched up mish-mash of a model we have now.
They're on the wrong path. I'm not going to bother arguing this anymore. I'm sick of the gaslighting. I'm sick of people trying to tell my that my personal experience is something that it's not because some educated idiot with a fancy C.V. in a university somewhere says otherwise.

And quite frankly, bitcoin isn't any easier than paypal. The real advantages of bitcoin are the ones people are giving up in favor of centralization.

Right, of course they don't. Yet another reason bitcoin is doomed, the people "accepting" it don't even want it.
Bitcoiners are fucking hilarious.

Employers. Banks. Universities. I've had my personal information stolen from all three on separate occasions. They all have your ID, your social security number, address, etc, etc.
Bitcoin removing that requirement is irrelevant. The problem is that you're required to give out that information as commonplace to comply with regulation to begin with. The point is that regulation doesn't really protect you from anything, and in some cases, it can even make you more vulnerable than not having that regulation at all.

When confronted about your poor and fallacious argument you then tried to sidestep my assertions by trivializing the fact that you were using textbook bullshitting techniques and insulting my intelligence (I looked that one up too, it's called an "ad hominem").

It used to be that the engineers would figure out the theories. This was shifted to the physicists when Einstein came to prominence. The worldview that I hold is based on a lot of work by the early electrical engineers, such as Steinmetz and Tesla. According to Einstein's laws, the stuff that they did was impossible. I wonder why that technology has never resurfaced. Hmmm... 
That's what happens when you ignore an entire facet of reality.
See what I'm getting at? They aren't using these as simply tools, but rather as entire world-views that dictate what is and isn't possible.

First of all, I'm not a crank, shit-head. I'm only "anti-science" in the same way most bitcoiners are "anti-economics", in the sense that they don't agree with the institution as it stands. I feel the same way about modern "theories" of physics as you do about keynesian economic "theories". I have a degree in CS. I'm a professional software engineer. I'm not just some yahoo spouting shit. I've put lots of thought and research over the years into what I've said, and I've come to the conclusions that I've come to for good reason.
Second of all, you're not contradicting *anything* I said on the subject (was that what you were even trying to do? I can't tell when you start out your post by insulting and belittling me). So thanks for helping me make my point.
And as a message to all of you, if you think that economics and finance are the only institutions about to experience a paradigm shift, then you're going to be in for a sore surprise. Things are about to change in a way you wouldn't even begin to comprehend, and this very much includes our knowledge of what reality itself is. This group, of all people, should be a little more open to the idea that modern beliefs are incorrect.

I'm saying that's what they're positioning themselves for by relinquishing the most powerful and innovative aspect of bitcoin: decentralization. They're simply substituting paypal with coinbase and bitpay. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.

Bitpay has over 15k merchants, coinbase has another N-thousand. If bitpay or coinbase get shut down for any reason, all those merchants aren't going to be "accepting" bitcoin anymore, are they?
They are highly centralized points of failure. Now is the time to do it right while we have a clean slate, but instead everyone is rushing to turn bitcoin into paypal as quickly as they can. It's unbelievably foolish.

Then let them keep using the current system instead of leeching off our economy and undermining bitcoin's decentralized nature.
I have no interest in doing business with someone who simply *pretends* to accept bitcoin, and I have no interest in having 3rd parties skim a percentage off the top when I can simply make a payment DIRECTLY to the person I'm doing business with.
Not to mention that these 3rd party processors are also collecting your information and are surely cooperating with governments to destroy your financial privacy. These guys don't give a fuck about you. They want to regulate your freedoms away for their own profit.

The US government has to end or it will end you.
The whole point of bitcoin is to put an end to centralized authority, not create more of it. The lot of you, so stupid.
But not like any of you idiots care. You slaves are just going to beg for MORE regulation and oppression instead. I've never seen such a huge, giddy collective of Stockholm Syndrome sufferers as the bitcoin "community."
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:44:41
Yeah, sure, if you want to be a moron who offers 10% discount to accept a currency that they don't even want, then pays an additional 1% to a 3rd party who they have to trust with their money to cash it out to fiat for them.
This guy obviously wants to accept bitcoin, not fiat, why else would he be offering the 10% discount to begin with? Because he wants to lose 11% of his profits for no good reason?
So that being the case, the best course of action is to simply accept payment directly rather than feeding the bitpay leeches.

Wow, so brave with your semantics. You know damn well what I meant, you pedantic cunt. How's that euphoria feel?
The point is, and I can't believe I have to spell this out, but you're autistic so I don't blame you, is that PEOPLE WANT THEIR LOCAL FIAT. THEY DON'T WANT TO USE YOUR GEEK TOKENS. BITPAY AND COINBASE ARE CREATING THE ILLUSION OF AN ECONOMY THAT *DOES NOT EXIST*.


Because the merchants "accepting" bitcoin aren't actually accepting bitcoin, they're just using bitpay to suck up your coins to be converted immediately back to USD defeating the whole point.


Again, missing the point like a typical autistic bitcoiner. There is *no* financial privacy with bitcoin when you use these services for *anything*. Bitpay and coinbase know every intimate detail of what you're buying from their merchants because they handle the fucking invoices. Use your head.


No, they aren't, because they don't do remittances. And yes, "leeches" BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT FOR FREE, WITHOUT COUNTER PARTY RISK BECAUSE THAT'S THE WHOLE FUCKING POINT OF BITCOIN.

It's not a loop. Bitcoin is libertarian principals formalized in software. It is a protocol that enforces libertarian principles.
It is the software formalization of free trade, property rights, and autonomy.
*Who* it attracts has nothing to do with it, like you said, because by very virtue of using the software you are participating in libertarian principals. The software enforces this, because it is *what the software does*.
Bitcoin does not conform to its users. The users must conform to its protocol.

1) It's not going to be hyper-"deflationary" forever. We're obviously ramping up, things will stabilize when/if we reach saturation.
2) If currency is going up in value, there will be less need for loans.
3) There are alternatives to loans in lots of cases, especially business loans where you'd receive *investments* instead of loans.
It stupefies me that people somehow find money increasing in value to be a bad thing. The keynesian mind virus has thoroughly infected you all.
Bitcoin's increase in value is breathing life into an entirely new economy. Our keynesian system is dead. They are manually pumping its heart and lungs to keep it going right now.

Look through my post history if you want to see how I feel about bitcoin. I've stated numerous times, that *you*, specifically, are (more or less) right and that people should listen to you.
What I was getting at is that the concept of the blockchain is a generalized solution to centralized record keeping, which is one of the main justifications of the state. It DOES have the ability, technologically, to replace a lot of what the state does. It's true. But again, it goes back to the social problem, which is that the state will use force to get what they want anyway so it doesn't matter, they will turn bitcoin into a tool for control.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:36:52
And woopty fuck, money isn't worth anything until you realize it by SPENDING it on something, until then its nothing but useless numbers. So what would you rather have, money that goes UP in value, or money that LOSES value?
See how fucking stupid you are? Here you are now arguing that it's a GOOD THING that the value is going up, which is what I've been saying this whole time. IT GIVES YOU MORE TO *SPEND*, WHICH IS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF MONEY.

trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still **suffer**s **from the inherent weakness**es **of** the **trust** based model. (emphasis mine)

Because you wouldn't be asking these questions otherwise.
My awareness is literally on a "higher dimension." I can see things that most people can't.
Are you familiar with frequency modulation? FM radio for instance. You tune into a particularly frequency, say 93.7Khz. That frequency is a carrier signal for more data (music, voice, whatever). That is, there is a signal embedded within another signal.
The universe works this same way. The 3D world we all experience is the "song" that's being broadcast on some carrier signal, but that carrier signal is also its own "song" that has this reality embedded within it. I have *seen* these "higher" dimensions. It's sort of like autostereograms (think those "magic eye" pictures), where they embed a 3d image within another 2d image, and if you know how to look at it correctly, it suddenly opens up and gains depth and you can see the embedded 3d image. Now imagine that if you know how to look at your 3d "reality" correctly you can see that it is embedded *within* a higher dimensional carrier signal.
So, tell me. What do you ponder? Are you still stuck in this reductionist, materialistic, 3d cultural prison (that teaches you that what I'm talking about doesn't exist or is "crazy"), or have you managed to break free and see that there is something *much deeper* happening?
I wrote the above before you changed you comment. I'm not trying to argue with you. I simply made my second comment to elaborate since you replied to my first one with "lol". If you agree with me then great. If not then maybe this will help other people put the pieces together.

The analogous language is not coincidental. If you have a background in computing then you should understand this archetypal situation very well. They are *literally* programming you with *code*. They are putting you into a particular *state*.
The problem is, you're all so fucking myopic that you're unable to see the universe as an abstract object. You're unable to see past the concrete (what you simpletons perceive as "reality") into the recurring archetypes that manifest themselves as the things you see as discrete concrete concepts. You are unable to see that situations that appear to be completely different on the surface, are literally the same thing when you delve into their abstract behavior and properties.
The universe is a self-similar computational object. You ever hear those egghead physicsts blabbering on about how the universe might be a computer or a "simulation"? Well, that's because it is. It's not that some people in lab coats have an actual physical computer simulating us somewhere, it's that computation is an inherent property of the universe itself, and this computational property keeps manifesting itself at all different scales and forms. From the human brain to microprocessors.
Art is the process of creation. It is conceiving, writing and executing your own new code. The big fucking trick that they've got you all with is that they've gotten you to *hate* art. They've tricked you into no longer creating, but instead to consume the things they create for you (again, *their* code). The mass media, pop music, TV, etc, etc. They are programming you with *their* culture that they've crafted to trick you into relinquishing your own ability to run your code on this universal computer.
You all have the power to create, but none of you want to realize it. You need to drop their shit and start inventing your own culture or else you're completely fucking doomed. None of you realize how *powerful* you truly are.

It's not a zero sum game, you idiot. I'm not saying SPEND ALL OF IT AT ONCE. But at some point you're going to be hungrier than you are wanting to "not lose potential gains". Obviously having money that gains in value is superior. You can sit on the money and not buy anything... and then what's the point of having the money? GET IT? Or you can spend it, knowing what you have left is going to increase in value, and that you're helping the economy by passing on money that's going to increase in value for others as well.


First you said people aren't going to want money that increases in value, and then you go on a spiel about how bitcoin is great because it increases in value. BUT WHAT IS THE POINT IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO SPEND IT? MONEY IS WORTHLESS UNTIL YOU SPEND IT. ERGO, BITCOIN IS GREAT MONEY. HOLY FUCKING SHIT, DUDE. COME ON.

Additionally, having money on the line is exactly the incentive needed to create a self-fulfilling prophecy, which is exactly why we're seeing so many people adopt bitcoin and so many people creating start-ups to create a more robust bitcoin infrastructure.

Except the merchants don't accept bitcoin, they "accept" bitcoin. All you're doing when you buy from a bitcoin/coinbase merchant is having bitpay/coinbase broker the deal for you. You give btc to bitpay, they give dollars to the merchant (minus their fee, of course), the merchant gives you goods. The merchants are accepting fiat, not btc.
Bitpay and coinbase are leeches that are acting as crutches preventing real adoption of btc. They've also become huge, centralized points of failure defeating bitcoin's decentralized nature entirely. One injunction or closed bank account and all those merchants are no longer "accepting" btc at all.
Bitpay and coinbase are toxic and dangerous.

The thing you dumb cunts don't understand is that you're completely owned. There is no "regulating bitcoin," as there is nothing to regulate. What they are doing is regulating *you*. You are all slaves who don't think for yourselves. You no longer have free will.
Think of a computer. A computer, on its own, does nothing. It sits and waits for you to have it execute some code. This is essentially what you mindless automatons are, you're simply sitting there waiting for something (the state) to give you instructions. Now think about this, everyone is essentially sitting idle on the subject of bitcoin because they're waiting for the government to *codify* what your behavior regarding it should be. You are literally waiting for the *government to program you with legal code*. You are all brainwashed. Completely and totally fucking *owned* (again, the computer analogy. You have been rooted, they are executing *their code* on you). Wake the fuck up. Be your own fucking user. Execute your own code, not theirs.

@_date: 2013-12-17 06:16:16
I suppose. Having the machines dispense fiat opens up a whole other can of regulatory worms, though, especially in the US.
One of the major faults of bitcoin right now is that it depends on fiat to obtain. It makes it susceptible to government fuckery because government uses your own money as a tool to manipulate your behavior, and it destroys the anonymity of the system by allowing all the money going into and out of the exchanges to be tracked.
The real unfortunate thing is that companies like coinbase and bitpay are making this problem even worse. They're onboarding companies to "accept" bitcoin payments, but get paid out in fiat. So bitpay and coinbase end up consolidating all the coin and selling them on the exchanges rather than having them distribute through the economy naturally through actual use and circulation. The entire bitcoin economy is entirely dependent on fiat and the established financial system right now. Pretty fucking weaksauce for something that should be displacing those institutions.

So you mean a libertarian principle? It allows for freedom for people to form societies as they see fit.


There's nothing to determine. Bitcoin is a software replacement for government's administrative duties and is a technological enforcement of property rights.


Yes, exactly. It doesn't make a difference. It is what it is. Using bitcoin is making an inherently libertarian statement whether you like it or not.
You're getting too hung up on "libertarian". Bitcoin is an absolute assault on the status quo and a direct affront to the state by its very nature. Call it what you will, but libertarianism (with a little l), is a pretty good description.

And if banks/regulators step in then it's game over. The fiat/btc gateway is a crippling and highly-centralized point of failure that at the complete and total mercy of the establishment. All it takes is one injunction from the government or one account termination from a bank, and suddenly all those bitpay/coinbase merchants are gone.
If bitcoin is to succeed then it has to happen through a grass-roots movement, rather than something we ask the state and bitcoin's competitors for permission to do. People have to want it and want to receive it in favor of fiat.

If you buy from an exchange (where they have all your personal information thanks to KYC/AML fuckery), and you move that money to a non-registered addresses, they will know who you are and they will come and fuck up your entire shit.

With bitpay they represent fiat. Do you see the problem? I know this can be hard for autists, but you need to think more broadly. They don't want bitcoin. So this is what's happening: you exchange your fiat for btc, you "spend" your btc, bitpay SELLS your btc back to you at a higher price than you bought it for, then pays the merchant in fiat. Lather, rinse, repeat. It's vampiric and illusory.


Never claimed there was. It's one of the problems bitcoin solves that you dumb ass bitcoiners keep trying to reintroduce.


Yeah, letting other people hold your private keys is so secure. Another problem bitcoin solves that you dumb ass bitcoiners keep trying to reintroduce. Not like it even matters because they're getting paid by bitpay in FIAT. Into their traditional bank accounts. See how pointless and stupid it is? You relinquish everything that makes bitcoin superior to traditional currency in order to get people to accept it, but they don't even want it in the first place. Good job, morons.
You keep talking to me as if I don't understand bitcoin. Allow me to repeat myself: I probably hold more bitcoin than 90% of the people on this sub.

This is how it must be done and how it should have always been done. Additionally, bitcoin's mining model is flawed and has made it impractical for people to mine coins without a significant financial investment. I suspect the original idea was for the coins to be distributed mainly through mining rather than exchanges this early on, but that's not the way it worked out. However it is now too late for many, as the paper trail has already been established. They know who is buying coin and where those coins are going. Audits will be inevitable.


This is largely irrelevant. The squeeze will come when whitelists are mandated (such as coinvalidation). It won't mater how you get your coins when you can only spend them from an address that's registered with your identity. This is exactly the "regulation" all these stupid cunts are begging for will be. You won't be able to buy so much as toilet paper to wipe your own ass with without the government's blessing. All registered addresses will be monitored, if you're caught accepting payment from an non-whitelisted address or making a payment to a non-whitelisted address you will be punished. If it is to become known that you use fiat to move btc into a non-whitelisted address you will be punished.
If they are truly devilish, and they may very well be, fiat will be dropped all together. Bitcoin will be the one-world currency. If you upset the powers that be, you will be blacklisted and you will be cut off from the system, unable to buy or receive anything. They may even blacklist your friends and family as well. You may also be imprisoned or murdered.
Bitcoin, in conjunction with submission to centralized authority will bring the dawning of the most horrific era of human existence there has ever been upon this earth. This is why it must be made clear, very early on, that no amount of slack is to be given to the government. The state must be put to an end now, while we still can.
If we do not make it clear that we own bitcoin (and *ourselves*), then bitcoin will be used to own us. Pandora's box has been opened and these are the only two possible outcomes.

Regardless of the validity of his claim, you're a moron for thinking post-thanksgiving announcements would have happened yet. Why the fuck would they do something over the weekend? How fucking stupid are you?
Dumb-ass bitcoiners. Your fucking brains do not work.

All money is fantasy. All of it. It is a human invention that is not inherent to nature. Value is purely a human projection and nothing more.
With that being said, I can't see how anything that people are forced to project value upon can be better than something that someone voluntarily projects value upon. Where there's force there's doubt, and eventually that doubt will prevail over force.

Posting from other accounts, perhaps?
To be honest I still had some hope up until fairly recently, but it's become overwhelming obvious that any good will left in the original movement has been extinguished as more and more of these fucktards jump on the train clamoring for regulation so they can make their quick bucks.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:09:52


Yep. Exactly. And we've learned our lesson the hard way haven't we, you oblivious fuck?


And those are the same idiots who keep posting about their coins getting swiped. Fucking duh. "Oh, you're too stupid to accomplish the trivial task of holding on to a file? Here, use the web wallet that's even less secure." Coddling idiots and encouraging their laziness and ignorance is counter-productive.


They can sell themselves if they want. If they don't want to deal with it, then don't. Using bitpay accomplishes *nothing*. It's a facade run by exploitative leeches and just prolongs the process of real adoption because they're providing a crutch that makes using bitcoin pointless.

I love it when naive, uncultured, americentric idiots reveal themselves.
Every single fiat currency to exist has failed. Every single one. Some of them within your lifetime. The Argentine peso, the Zimbabwe dollar, the Peruvian sol, the Chilean escudo, the Angolan kwanza, the Yugoslavian dinar, Belorussian rubble. Need I continue? You might want to go talk to the millions of people alive on earth who have gone though currency collapse themselves. You think it can't happen in the US? Then you're in for a shock.

That's exactly what you implied you stupid asshole.
Do you not understand what visa and mastercard are you dumb twat? They issue DOLLAR CREDITS. THEY ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO BITPAY AT ALL. BITPAY PAYS OUT DOLLARS. DOLLARS ARE NOT BITCOIN CREDITS. IT IS A SIMPLE CONCEPT YOU MENTALLY DECREPIT FUCKER.
MERCHANTS ARE NOT ACCEPTING BITCOINS BECAUSE BITPAY GIVES THEM DOLLARS. THEY ARE NOT USING THOSE DOLLARS TO BUY BITCOINS. BITCOINS ARE BEING REMOVED FROM THE LOOP BY BITPAY.
Now go choke on air you fucking peon.

I used to be polite here. The problem with these ignoramuses is that they're so profoundly ignorant that they can't even recognize when someone knows what they're talking about. So I figure if I'm going to be downvoted for trying to have high-level discussions I may as well just treat them like the abject invalids they are. Honestly, this hostility seems to be way more effective than being reasonable ever was, so I guess my decision to take these conversations down to their level is working.

Of course there is doubt. If there wasn't doubt then force wouldn't be required. Hay muchas dudas.

You're not losing, you idiot. You spent the money, you spent the money, it's that fucking simple. Once you spend it it's not yours, you're not losing a god damned thing, not to mention that the value of the rest of your BTC holdings is going to go up as well, quite possibly enough to cover the cost of whatever it was you just bought. NOT REALIZING POTENTIAL GAINS IS NOT A LOSS.
Additionally, with inflationary fiat, the seller still "loses" by selling sooner rather than later, because if they waited another day to sell to you, they could get more money out of you due to its value decreasing.
I can't believe the keynesian mental gymnastics you morons keep pulling out of your ass. "IT'S BAD FOR THE VALUE OF OUR MONEY TO INCREASE. WE LOSE WHEN THE VALUE GOES UP." No, you dope, everyone WINS when the value goes up.
 
SO. FUCKING. STUPID. GOD DAMMIT, YOU SIMPLE-MINDED BITCOINERS.

I *get* what you are saying, but you are not understanding what I am saying.


YES. EXACTLY. That *is* a scientific breakthrough, but you can't ignore what that means in a larger context. *Why* was that a problem that needed solving? Many people disagree that it even *is* a problem. It's a scientific solution to a *political problem*.
If technological enforcement of property rights isn't political then I don't know what is. If technological bypass of governments and their institutions isn't political then I don't know what is. If the technological ability to trade freely with anyone regardless of what governments might say about it isn't political then I don't know what is. Anything that disrupts established social order is political.
I am NOT saying that bitcoin was built with "libertarianism" in mind, but *what was his impetus for building such a system in the first place?* What I am saying is that regardless of what Satoshi's intentions were, bitcoin happens to formalize a certain set of core axioms within its protocol, and these axioms are libertarian in nature. They are not democratic in nature. They are not socialist in nature. They are not communist in nature. They are not anything else, because of the very nature of *what the protocol does* and how it inherently removes a centralized authority from the equation. 
This formlessness you speak of IS the same "libertarianism" I speak of. But the thing is, it's *not* entirely formless because it is a **protocol**. There is still a certain set of fundamental rules that must be followed. Bitcoin doesn't have to be used in a libertarian context, but ultimately it leaves it to the people to *voluntarily agree* to not use it in a libertarian context, which of course is also a libertarian principle. The system we have now affords no choice, because fuckery is built into the system itself and many people do not participate out of their own consent, but rather pure coercion.


Again, you misunderstand me. What I mean is that if you use bitcoin, you MUST OBEY THE PROTOCOL. There is no choice in the matter because that's what a protocol is. I can't use bitcoin to take things away from you, because the protocol doesn't allow for that. I can't ever make taking things away from you a thing that bitcoin does, because bitcoin doesn't conform to my whims. I must obey the protocol, there is no other option, the software literally won't allow for it. If I don't like the protocol and what it enforces, then I don't use bitcoin. The protocol enforces **FREEDOM**!

This is so much fucking bigger than taxes. It's about getting the fuck out before the zionist central bankers clamp the fuck down on you and rape you, your family and everything you love to death. Get ready for overt global slavery and murder on a scale that your adorably naive little brain can't possibly comprehend. Their scam is falling apart and now they're preparing for the slaughter. Violence is the only option they have left, and they finance the most powerful military the world has ever known.

How dense can you possibly be?
It's your toxic keynesian mindset that's bad for the economy, not the medium of exchange. The medium of exchange is great because it keeps INCREASING IN VALUE WHICH HELPS THE ECONOMY THRIVE.
UNREALIZED POTENTIAL GAINS ARE NOT LOSES. GET THAT THROUGH YOUR HEAD. YOU HAVEN'T LOST ANYTHING, *ESPECIALLY* IF YOU STILL END UP *AHEAD* EVEN AFTER YOU'VE BOUGHT SOMETHING. YOU CANNOT LOSE SOMETHING YOU *NEVER* HAD IN THE FIRST PLACE.
I've bought tons of shit with bitcoin, and I'm still literally hundreds of thousands of dollars ahead. Why would I not want to continue to spend now that I have all this new buying power? That is a whole. fucking. point. Money is used to BUY SHIT.
Additionally, why would I EVER want to sell something if I can sell it to you for more tomorrow because the value of your money has decreased (which is our current situation with the dollar)? THE WORLD NEEDS TO TURN, THAT'S WHY. PEOPLE NEED TO BUY AND SELL SHIT. ACTUAL, REAL-LIFE NEEDS OUTWEIGH POTENTIAL FUTURE GAINS. Why would you buy a computer now if you can buy the same computer for less a month later? BECAUSE YOU NEEDED THE COMPUTER. IT IS SO SIMPLE. HOW IS THIS SO HARD FOR YOU TO COMPREHEND?
