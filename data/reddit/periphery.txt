I recommend [btcmarkets]( As an ex coin jar user more competitive exchange rates and better support.

Good stuff that's a really cool idea, I would love to see anything you get done.
Code sans the [particle emitter is now up  on github here](

Its pretty simple for just the jump button, but it would also need one to trigger the "moon jump" and controls to speed up / slow down the coaster while  Roller Coaster Guy is on the ground.

It can be, give me an hour to put it up on github. I just need to strip a library out that is not Open Source. Game will still run Bitcoin Roller Coaster guy  will just be missing the "sparks" particle emitter when on the rails.
I had originally wanted to make a game / fun visualisation around the Lightning network but figured my knowledge of lightning was lacking. So happy to lend support to someone who wants to take it in that direction.

No its pretty simple, just swap out the instances where I am testing if the spacebar is down i.e this.spaceBar.isDown line 336 game.js. 
Then swap it out to call a function when a tap is detected instead. You can see [an example to show you how to do it on the Phaser site here](

Ahh that really sucks. All the reason we need to move past them with crypto. Its one thing to have policies another to be completely untouchable.

Time to [Contact the Financial Services Ombudsman]( Like most other big industries in Australia you normally need to threaten a call to the ombudsman to move forward.
