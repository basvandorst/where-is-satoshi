Who is dying in the streets in USA?
You're so full of shit.

You are entirely correct, that is the way things were, and for the most part that is the way things are still... Although it is changing, there is no assurance of how they or you will be treated.
It can be risky for them to meet with outsiders, especially journalists, see the Vice article linked elsewhere in this thread.

I have met with those guys before. They are very nice and very interested in the ideas of Bitcoin.
However, internet on the island is sparse (other than the rich folk who work resorts and have mobile internet phones), but it is definitely worth meeting with Nelson and his friends if you are on the island.
Beyond that, I wouldn't expect much luck in sharing the ideas of Bitcoin to an island of people who largely do not have internet access and largely are not honest with tourists (they all want something).

Don't bring USD, they take 10% right off the bat. Convert to CAD first if you can.
Beyond that, the "local economy" is a state economy... I wouldn't get too many heartwarming feelings but dumping my cash there, I try to mainly buy flea market type stuff that I can be pretty confident the merchant will just be pocketing the cash.

Oh, okay, that settles it!
I don't think anyone here thinks he is going to convince you. As Libertarians, we encounter your ignorance everyday, we generally refer to you as lost causes. What throwaway-o is doing here is far more beneficial to the dozens of readers who will likely read all of this and be able to see your mistakes explained.
I find it hilarious to say "if you call stealing stealing, YOU'RE BIAS!"... It's just hilarious, that really holds no water, regardless. You'd be better off trying to say "Well it's a necessary evil for the greater good etc etc" (which is still wrong).

OR be twice as cheap.
@_date: 2013-08-12 13:51:16
Isn't this not even worth the effort? I figured the police won't be able to do a thing and won't even try, do you think there's anything they can do?

And this is why we need bullshit retirement programs, forcefully funded by the young, which always end in disaster... Because people are not allowed to save their money.

You're disgusting and Irrational considering I've given NO way of receiving "handouts"

Gmail address? Red flag
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:11:44
That's right.
I've come to peace with it,  expensive lessons are the longest lasting.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:25:20
It's a recovery against the hacker downtime, not another bubble (just yet)
@_date: 2013-08-12 14:07:41
I doubt it. I only logged into MtGox through a minimal VM (that was only used for this) securely and hadn't logged on in a couple months.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:41:50
I think most of us think it will go up more **in the longterm**. But in the next couple months, anything could really happen, although most of us are confident it at least won't lose too much value.
Just put in what you can spare, a BTC here and there.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:13:29
I've been following bitcoin for 18 months now... I always wanted to buy. Why didn't I? I don't know, it wasn't simple to buy and mix that in with my stoner tendencies and here we are... Today I finally put in $3000, but I will FOREVER kick myself for not doing the same 18 months ago.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:01:12
I hope so because I've got a lot of btc and not much cash left!
@_date: 2013-08-12 15:15:12
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:24:15
Its just related to mtgox problems the past two days. It's recovering to where it should be.
I wouldn't be wary until it starts climbing fast above 200
@_date: 2013-08-12 14:08:02
Yes, the best I can do with this situation is use it as one hell of an expensive learning experience.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:43:21
MtGox may ultimately ruin bitcoin ;/
@_date: 2013-08-12 14:35:54
Correct, however it's been a couple months since I've even logged in.
@_date: 2013-01-08 14:17:31
Sure, force is the immoral part of any equation though.
@_date: 2013-08-12 15:15:51
Thanks, expensive lesson learned... I already knew the internet had many assholes on it :)
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:04:39
Excuse me? I knowingly took a risk. I knew this was a possible outcome.
I'm very financially stable, you assuming idiot.
@_date: 2013-08-12 14:09:56


Yes, but they could fingerprint it, know the area etc. Right now, I have to tell the cops that I bought some internet money and held it remotely in Japan and someone anonymously stole it.
I could see that case being thrown on the shelf right away.
Worth a shot though, I guess, nothing to lose... I will try to get the required info from MtGox.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:34:43




Go for it. I plan on selling half of mine when we get over 200 just to make any money that I've put in back.
When that will be? This week, I'd guess, but who really knows.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:54:34
That could very well be the case. Let's hope not!
(and it was $210 :( )
@_date: 2013-08-12 12:53:53
Yeah... I feel stupid, I meant to set up my own wallet earlier but have been so busy... Now I'm out of all the money I had saved, this could have been sweet vacations, whatever... I feel so stupid, yet even more angry that someone could do this.
Sorry, I need to rant somewhere... What a start to the week. I hope BTC succeeds but I'm down and out for the count now.
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:49:18
The statement still applies. If I had done this 18 months ago I would have been up without risk. I knew I was taking a risk last week and here we are now! ;)
Expensive lesson to not get caught up in any hype.
@_date: 2013-08-12 13:05:57
Yeah. I don't even know where to begin. I wasn't BTC community involved so I wasn't aware of all this shit that should be done, I assumed MtGox was secure... bad assumption.
I only hope others read this and take note, losing this much money is crushing to anyone. I think I'll be sick over this for the next year.
@_date: 2013-08-12 13:36:34
Thanks, I really appreciated your post.
I had meant to set up a private wallet at home, yet I procrastinated. Quite the brutal lesson to take, but I felt safe at MtGox.
I appreciate not berating me, I'm aware of what I've done and how much I've lost!
@_date: 2013-08-12 12:54:58
Possibly. My bills are paid, gas in the car and dog is fed. This was money that could be used on vacations or things like that, I won't lose my house or anything now but I'll be severely depressed.
@_date: 2013-08-12 14:08:58
Really? I have subscribed, but I barely read a thing here... I do have a life and do other things. I can't remember seeing anything regarding this before, although I'm sure it's there... I'm just saying, I'm sure there's many other BTC holders who don't read past the cover, I really hope the same doesn't happen to them.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:30:05


I hope this is what you meant... Otherwise, be careful.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:57:13
I hear ya. I bought at 200 per too but at this point, for me, its more worth just holding out and waiting for some gains.
@_date: 2013-08-12 13:45:12
You're all correct! I put $6000 in, I only lost $4000 at today's value!
Good math guys!
@_date: 2013-08-12 21:30:11
Ah, thought I would have had to register for those to work.

Really not interested in handouts, thanks :)
@_date: 2013-08-12 15:14:32
Awesome. I hope others do the same as well.
It's as most consolation as I could possibly take away from this :)
@_date: 2013-08-12 12:37:52
No, I wasn't aware of this.
I feel beyond stupid, this was most of my savings.
I am going through support with MtGox atm, I am doubtful.. Hopefully others can learn from this, how crushing that someone could even do this.
