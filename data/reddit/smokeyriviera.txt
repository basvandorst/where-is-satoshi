Which is going to be harder in countries that aren't as advanced as the USA, also you need to be sure that your able to access it which requires internet. Further, cash is still far more useful in this system as their is no need to find another bitcoin user, as everyone uses cash.

Why would you compare to a country that is so much worse than your own. Comparisons only work when you compare similar things. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:15:06
You live in a third world country?
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:13:11
Thats not true, its a mix between commodity backed and fiat
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:25:33
Nah you didnt, but you defended the silly comparison of bitcoin to venezuelan currency 
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:23:36
Then the fact you can buy bread with Bitcoin is irrelevant as your situation is not the same. If your US and your answer is not yet dont worry your country is far to rich to go third world.
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:59:20
Good shit, doesn't solve the issue of search costs as you spend your day walking to find some dude whose going to accept your bitcoin for bread because you decided that bitcoin is more important than your local currency. If your a third world country your not a player on the world stage, your a beggar. Your not worried about giving dirt cheap service, because you need to spend money on food. There not launching satellites, thats for rich countries who will do it for their country alone.
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:11:33
You defend the analogy in the same post as criticising an equally silly analogy. 
Also, this has probably been the best time to own bitcoin and use it for its intended purpose due to the lower percentage fluctuations. Can we say the same for the Venezuelan currency? Nope, another reason why the comparison is poor. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:12:20
The issue is bitcoin isn't really working, at least not for its intended purpose. A large portion of the community is investing in bitcoin rather than using it as a medium of exchange, which is a possible reason as to its volatility. It's more expensive to use than fiat currencies in most if not all countries, in the countries it's most widely used it serves no real purpose as it is not a better currency than the dominant currency, and in these countries the banks can be trusted to solve the issue of double spending. In countries where banks cannot be trusted, it is not widely usable enough to be a useful currency. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:44:40
Find me a piece of evidence saying volatility to the extremes of bitcoin in a currency is a good thing. I highly doubt their is. And what does that even mean? How can things be more volatile than whats on the graph, as volatility is a measure of price fluctuations. Cool, I get the point that its useful to you, but this was started over the fact that its not particularly useful to use in third world trade which I will maintain, as the only answers you seem to provide are about how you use Bitcoin.
Realise that your not typical compared to the world. Also that Bitcoin is massively flawed.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:34:01
No commodity, is just contains a mix of the attributes of both commodity and fiat currencies. The reason its not a straight commodity currency is it has no intrinsic value, but its has high costs of production and limited supply and at set rate, with limited ability to control supply.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:43:06
Several reasons. If Bitcoin is supposed to be a legitimate currency, why are we comparing to a currency that is on the brink of failing. It would be like saying North Korea is doing well because its not murdering 25% of their population like the Khmer Rouge. And a currency having crazy devaluations is not a good currency. You look for returns with currency, you use it goods/services and investments. Otherwise by just keeping it in an account gaining value means it has no use to an economy as its not being used to help produce anything. If Bitcoin was used as the only currency with stable devaluations then you have the issue Japan faced in its lost decade. But yeah be glad with your returns, keep buying and hoarding and limiting those who could really use it. Keep wanting the price to increase, so those in the countries where they actually need to protect their currencies from authoritarian rulers can't afford it. But yeah great returns. From a currency. Where stability is essential. Because otherwise who is going to spend when their money is worth 50% in a months time.

Why the opposite though? Is there any reasoning or just faith? If you want to see it happen look at low rated assets and see what happens to their volume when a recession happens.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:45:05
This leaves a problem for Bitcoin though. People cash in on their riskiest investments an head to bonds, blue chips, or gold. Gold is a decent store of value with a long reputation. Bitcoin is brand new and we don't know what its going to be yet. In a dip, people will leave because of risk
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:55:05
Surely you could just download the source code and determine which addresses have brought in the recent past vs those who haven't for a certain time period, and then after a certain time frame they are considered lost?
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:36:46
Fair, you are right, it wasnt a strawman. But I'd argue rather than correcting, he provided an additional function. Yes forgery was important charateristic, alongside durability/innertness, whilst it helped that it was easily transformable due to its low melting point.
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:57:51
Strawman, I didnt say anything about forgery. 
Value of gold fluctuates in modern times, but I'm talking a few centuries ago. Its purpose when gold was linked to a currency, which is what I'm talking about, was that it maintained value rather than corrodes away due to interaction with gases found in the atmosphere. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:14:08
The idea that currencies should be backed by gold is explained by simple logic and reasoning. A coin that constitutes a certain amount of the currency, is either replaceable by the commodity its linked to, or is made out of said commodity, and the weight gives it the value. This allows faith in the currency, for individuals can go redeem it for a tradeable good at any point. 
Secondly, for gold in particular, the reason we use commodities is for their store of value ie. gold is still worth the same in a year as it is now. As gold didnt detiorate in quality quickly, we used that as a store of value, so that individuals could replace coins with gold, and it would still be worth the same in a few years time. In previous societies this was needed and necessary due to no computers, and lack of tech to produce polymers that could work as well as gold.

Tbf, I'd probably fail a test. I wish I knew more, just don't have time for it. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:53:53
I probably should 3rd year econ student, and I've still made a fuck load of mistakes on this thread and others today. Though, we haven't done much on technical side of commodity currencies, like a lecture on their history in first year and thats it. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 08:15:10
No breakdown of the gold standard followed by breakdown of Bretton woods meant gold wasn't needed for currency anymore 
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:43:45
Or you can read threw our post history and see that I do, but it seems to have been missed that I only pointed at one of the multitude of reasons gold was used. Bit too lazy to go through inertness/durability/tradeability/forgery/production/rarity aspects of gold. Maybe seeing as you know so much about gold, currency and Bitcoin youd explain something that I have no idea about.
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:28:41
Definitely which is why I would never advocate to go back. Wasn't my intention to come off like that, the UK suffered enough when Churchill stuck us back on the gold standard at an overvalued rate. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:11:49
Yeah 100% true, I needed to think it through a little more. Thanks, this whole thing blew up a little more than I was expecting. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:56:52
Nah its cool I was on a defensive thing, as people were jumping but I enjoy the argument. It probably did, but it was never my intention, I like fiat far more than Bitcoin and commodity currencies. 
Funnily enough I'm the opposite on reddit. Its the one place I can argue with no consequences. If your cool with my reaction, I'm cool with your assumptions.
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:32:42
Or he holds for four years, and what was worth 10k, is now worth 0.
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:25:07
Wasn't really arguing against there not being inflationary effects in an economy. My point is that as gold does not corrode, it is useful as a currency, for in a year the £1 coin will still be £1 rather than corroding in the atmosphere and thus lowering its weight, and therefore its intrinsic value is lowered. 
As I mentioned in another comment, the strawman dismissiveness was wrong, and I should have given more thought, but that does not mitigate the point that one of the primary aspects of gold being used as a currency is its store of value ie, its ability not to corrode. Though your first comment is right, we can use other commodities, shells have been used in the past, but we settled on gold due to it not breaking as easily, and not corroding as easily. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:51:41
Does it really come across as if I'm advocating for gold backed currencies? I'm not merely pointing out the reasons why they did exist. It made sense in the past but at the moment fiat currency is much better for us. I'm wondering because your the second person who felt I prefer commodity currencies over fiat, which is not what I was going for at all. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 09:38:07
For which currencies is gold needed? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:43:02
When I say store of value, I mean a $1 coin made out of gold, will still have a value of $1 worth of gold in the future time period. This coin will not corrode and weigh a lesser amount, and so even if you see inflation, it will still be have a value of $1 worth of gold in future prices. This coin will not suddenly be half the size, and therefore half the value under the gold standard and worth 50 cents. Have I explained my point of view? I feel people have misunderstood what I am saying? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:05:07
Keep the faith.
