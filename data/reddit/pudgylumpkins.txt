You give so few fucks you couldn't even be bothered to finish your thought. I'm impressed.

Most college football fans know of them.

The Lenovo Y50 is really a pretty damn good deal IMO. I had one for a little while before selling it to make a down payment on my car.

Lenovo Y50, seriously a pretty damn good price for the performance it provides.

You don't have your card number memorized?
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:56:48
I have 3 BTC currently. And a comparable amount of USD in my checking account. There's no way in Hell I can realistically afford 1/2 a BTC or 200 USD out of the goodness of my heart.

They've been getting a bad rap lately. At least shop around for a better deal before buying there. You may find one.
@_date: 2014-10-10 05:05:44
I don't carry cash, so the card buys everything.
@_date: 2014-10-24 03:03:20
Only because you keep looking at bitcoin related topics.

I like money

It isn't, this sub is a bit outlandish at times.

So if I buy some gold, how would I sell it?
@_date: 2015-09-26 08:48:11
Okay come on, it's about on par with what the kid did. There isn't too much impressive about either.
@_date: 2015-09-26 08:32:10
Assembling desktop computers isn't impressive really. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:25:11
Nice, well I'll give you a shot, man. Just as soon as Coinbase gets my bitcoin in my account.

Those prices are insane. I've been needing to pick up some more workout shorts, but at that price I'm wondering about quality. Are these the kind of shorts that are super thin, likely to fall apart at the seams after a few months of use? 
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:34:57
Do they have a silky feel to them or are they more textured? I like to wear shorts where you forget they're even on, you know?
@_date: 2015-02-16 08:00:49
I'm going to give the guy a shot, even if it ends up being terrible it really isn't too much of a loss. 4 shorts from this guy is like buying one at the store. Might as well.

Jesus, now you're scaring me man, I want to get my wallet offline but I'm still not sure what the best way to do it is.

Hope that links to the bitcoin option, if not, click on the bitcoin symbol underneath join  now.

I'd settle for enough to pay off my student loans, but a cool trillion would be nice.

Going to their website shows .77 btc for lifetime subscription. No lifetime option in USD.

Looks like Subway every day.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:46:04
That's a punch in the gut.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:49:09
Yeah, but then we can't really impose our will on other people, how about just you guys get rid of the nukes, we'll keep ours.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:28:38
How'd that happen?
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:08:51
I'm not sure why but when I first clicked on the link I'm thinking maybe I'll list my old car... Based on the general price range I'm seeing, maybe it's better to stick with craigslist for the time being.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:26:44
IIRC you should have gotten a message afterwards explaining how to set up a wallet. Hopefully you did get that message.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:07:09
I'm going to need you to hold off on buying for a very long time then.
