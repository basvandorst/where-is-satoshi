@_date: 2014-05-06 00:33:46
Hmm.. from a philosophical/logical standpoint, or as close as I can get....
(1) Laws are externally implemented rules in my experience, and so they're not natural and will typically impose a sense of force. People tend to resist that. American USD is a great example. One of the innovated aspects of bitcoin is that the "laws" or rules are mathematically part of the protocol itself. For instance, you don't need laws that regulate and provide trust if the system itself is programmed to be trust-less. 
(2) Currencies facilitate illegal activities just like hands and fingers do, do they not? Cars facilitate illegal activities, so does water, legs, flashlights, etc. See how crazy this idea is? The currency could change. People could trade goats for guns. I'm not sure what you mean by, "brunt of the legal liability for its use". 
(3) The regulation question is difficult because of the international scope of bitcoin and the diversity of users and uses. I can't really answer this question well.
(4) The best I can say is a disruptive one. This kind of innovation is groundbreaking, and it's effects on our current monetary system could change the political landscape as well. Decentralization is bad if your in the business of controlling everything. 
Best of luck on your dissertation!

Legislation. Main stream bitcoin use depends on exchanges. If the government passed legislation making bitcoin illegal, than the exchanges would either be considered illegal (and it would be illegal for companies to accept bitcoin) or they would be unable to work with banks. Either way, mainstream bitcoin would die. 
Without a doubt, the biggest threat to bitcoin at the moment is government intervention/shutdown.

I'm not sure that there is a perfect system for anything. There are vastly more scammers in the world of fiat currencies, but we don't eliminate those currencies as a result. Kidding aside, the biggest scammers of all are politicians and bankers. Still, it feels like some people want to use paper money regulation in a digital currency world. I don't think that will work well. 
If a bank gets robbed every other week because it's in the most dangerous part of the country, the answer isn't to hire more security and add regulations, the answer is to "change the system of execution" by moving that bank to a different location, or using a system that doesn't allow them to be robbed. The path of least resistance. 
We may see some regulation eventually at the exchange level, but for now, I think Bitcoin is evolving fine on its own.

Can someone smarter than I explain the subtleties here? I thought FinCen already gave this statement,
"Bitcoin miners and investors will not be regulated by the US Treasury. The clarification came in a pair of rulings yesterday from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the US Treasury Department, which said that people who mine virtual currencies for personal use and businesses that buy and sell virtual currencies purely as an investment will not be considered money transmitters, exempting them from requirements to register with the government and comply with certain money-laundering regulations that it appeared may have applied to them."
Is it because CoinPayments.net isn't "purely an investor"?

You're right about that, and I want to decrease the possibility for scams as well. I just hope we can do it in a more "natural" way, within the protocol itself, instead of external regulation. 
Scammers are normal, and they exist in all areas of enterprise. My point was that the bitcoin protocol isn't innately a bad thing just because scammers exist. It's impossible to remove all possibility of scamming without removing all human interaction. There will always be at least one person trying to take advantage over another. There is no form of regulation that can eliminate human nature. 
So, we do what we can to reduce it as much as we can. I'm on board with that!

Buffett also said he doesn't understand how to evaluate Apple Computers. Emerging technologies are much harder to grasp for the aging population. A dollar bill has no intrinsic value, yet Buffett has billions of them. The internet has no intrinsic value, yet here we are. Only perceived value really matters. I think Buffett's concern is that bitcoin doesn't have perpetual perceived value, and the bubble will soon burst. But read a lot of the articles on bitcoin that are written by financial analysts and you can see a clear lack of understanding. Banks turned down loans for early computer companies because, "personal computers have no value". 
The bitcoin protocol will stick around, but it's use as a currency medium is still questionable. 
Anyway.... currently, the value is determined now by bid/ask spreads. What is someone willing to pay vs what is someone willing to sell. Much like commodity trading.

They don't sell buckets. Is English your second language? Nowhere in your link does it provide information corroborating your claim that LMAX is the fastest exchange. So, your plan is to make ambitious claims, and when someone asks about your reasoning you tell them to go Google it? The LMAX website itself, as well as it's Wikipedia page offer no claim or information related to, "being the fastest exchange". Perhaps you should take your own bending advise.

I get what you're saying, but, you're talking about the people who maintain the system, you're not talking about the system. It's like saying bicycle racing is innately corrupt, because some racers doped during a race and administrators helped them. The illegal actions of a person(s) don't define the race. The Constitution isn't an active regulator of people and societies it's a guideline that PEOPLE choose to accept or not. 
Aside from all of this, if you chose to absolutely define "government" as corrupt, then of course they will always be corrupt, because you have already defined it as so from the onset. It's similar to the saying, "whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right".

Adding "regulation" is not always the correct route. Letting systems or environments to balance themselves naturally can work.

You're talking about violence, control, force, and corrupt and irresponsible attitudes, which can happen to any system. I was explaining that because one system is corrupted by the people within, it doesn't necessarily follow that the foundations of the system are corrupt. For example, if a police officer uses excessive force, it doesn't mean the system of policing is wrong or evil.
Also, I never said anything about society being ruled by violence, so it sounded like you were talking about something else.

The people telling you there is no way it can hit those low values are incorrect, and it can certainly hit zero as well. The question is, how likely is that? 
It's only worth what people are willing to spend to buy it. If the protocol became corrupt, or all exchanges were outlawed, or an alternative currency took bitcoin's place than it would essentially become worthless.

I guess there are some similarities, depending on how you spin it, but the bitcoin protocol itself isn't analogous to online poker. You're correct in saying it's not "easy" to get paid with fiat currency, but it's only a relative term, and it only applies IF you want to exchange for a dollar, yen, etc. 
The amount of hoops and difficulty vary depending on the exchange your using, your bank account, and some other variables. US based companies like Coinbase have made it quite easy. I usually receive USD in my account within four days of a payment request. It's probably more difficult if you're withdrawing massive amounts of money though. Bitcoin is still an emerging market, so it's not streamlined enough at the moment.

The main problem I see with the article (amongst others) is that it's discussing Bitcoin as if it's been commonplace for 50 years. It's similar to when I hear people discuss solar energy or wind turbines. 
"Wind turbines aren't a billion percent efficient so we should forget about them all together."
It's the thought that, "If it doesn't work flawlessly out of the gate, we should scrap all together". You have to give innovation a chance and allow the bitcoin system to develop over time.
@_date: 2014-06-24 16:35:43
I highly doubt it. The potential buyers are looking to purchase these coins for long term growth, not to dump them on an exchange.

C'mon now, get real. I know it's not "fair" or "right", but the United States does whatever the United States wants to do. You're fooling yourself if you think otherwise. 
Notice I said, "If the United States government made bitcoin illegal, mainstream bitcoin use would die". I agree the protocol system would continue to develop and segway into many other uses. But, we're only talking about financial systems here. FinCen has already shut down several US based exchanges because they were unable to comply with money transmitter regulations. 
Authority? The US is under no ones authority. They do as they please. Read the news, any day, any time. CIA, NSA, etc...
You're vastly underestimating the ability of the United States government. 
It's not limited to the United States though. Any government could do this. Even the fate of Cyprus is in jeopardy. Cyprus received a bailout after they trashed their economy. One of the conditions of the bailout was, "Cyprus had to undergo an independent examination of its anti-money-laundering practices." So, they're already under the microscope. A few weeks ago the Central Bank of Cyprus issued a statement on bitcoin, "Bitcoin activities without the necessary licensing are in breach of legislation.”
Bitcoin protocol was developed to be decentralized and avoid regulation, so it's only natural that it's biggest threat is the government.

Bitcoin solves a lot of current issues. Where have you been? 
Anyways, my point is Bitcoin is an emerging technology. It's not appropriate to hold it against established standards. It's like saying, "We shouldn't pursue alternative energy like windfarms and solar because they don't perform like established nuclear plants". The protocol is clearly a great innovation. We should continue to develop it and see where it can take us, not throw it away because it doesn't work at JP Morgan, etc.

It's a step forward into something new and possibly world changing. The current banking system is ancient and hasn't seen much innovation in the last 50 years. Bitcoin could affect (or already has) people in a similar way that the internet did when it first boomed in the 1990's. When it comes to transporting information, services, and goods, Bitcoin could have major impact. It doesn't have to be Bitcoin however, just the concept of digital cypto currencies is enough to create innovation.

Violence and brute force yes, sometimes. Other times, they just make a new law. New legislation gets passed every year, ratifying new and old laws. Financial regulations change every year. I don't need to share any laws to demonstrate the intrusiveness and power of the United States. It's evident everywhere you look. NSA spying, more aircraft carriers than the entire world combined, military bases in every country, political scandals and bribes, etc, etc.
The US government doesn't play nice or fair. Remember what happened with Mega Upload? Complete bullshit, but they did it anyway. 
I'm also sick to death of the USA. I don't understand what that has to do with me traveling or bitcoin. But, I would like to travel more. Any suggestions? Always wanted to go to New Zealand. 
I think you have the wrong idea. I'm not in favor of the United States. I'm not in favor of regulating bitcoin. I'm not in favor of USD. I was just answering OP's question. The answer to that question is without a doubt, 100%, government intervention. Not hackers or Mark Karpeles.
I want bitcoin to be accepted and used. Even my UN has "BTC" in it.
You're correct about the threat to US economy. Bitcoin could potentially destabilize things, but this is all the more reason for the government to fight against it, and we don't want that. Sure, they can't un-invent bitcoin protocol, but they can render it's use as a currency medium essentially useless.  
@_date: 2014-03-14 18:59:36
I get where you're going with this, and I understand the argument (How can one country legislate in the world?). The United States can. Not that I want them to (I certainly don't), but they can (at least to a degree). Most American banks are international, or held by international companies. They could easily be "compelled" to comply with certain legislation. 
It wouldn't necessarily have to be international. If bitcoin was illegal in The States, it would have a large effect on exchanges and users world wide. Remember, USD is the most traded currency in the world.

Most of the article echoes the same misunderstandings and assumptions as all the other daily articles on Bitcoin. "Bitcoin is too volatile, it can't work as a currency, blah, blah". It's like they have a cookie cutter mold of USD and if Bitcoin doesn't fit that exact mold they conclude it's worthless. It still feels like the political/financial pundits can't grasp the technology and innovation of the Bitcoin platform. Bitcoin is a new creature. It's not a replacement for USD.
At least the article did conclude this,
 "So where does that leave us? With the conclusion that bitcoin likely can't work as a currency, but some sense that the ledger- based technology that underlies it could hold promise."

With respect, this is ridiculous and dishonest. BTC maximalism is like a psychosis. 
Lightning doesn't work. Maybe it one day will, but it doesn't now. It's not Brave's job or interest to work on lightning, especially when they don't think it works. Ethereum, which has many more scaling options, was selected. The team thinks this is a better option. So far, it looks like they're correct. 
Sorry they didn't prop up your btc bags.
Other than process slower and cost more, I'm still waiting to hear what BTC does that BAT cant.
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:53:17
If it worked, it would be a viable and usable scaling solution for users. Right now, it is not, as evidenced by the facts. Do you think users are being held hostage and forced not to use lightning? 
It's clear I can read, as I've been able to navigate your drivel, so let's stick to the points. 
I'm still waiting to hear what BTC does better than BAT. It's not speed, cost or smart contracts. So, what is it?

@_date: 2019-04-26 15:19:25

Brave is in the browser business, not the blockchain development business. Brendan Eich and his team are not dummies. They did what they thought was the best idea, and so far, they're not wrong. Raising money for a project is not a novel idea. It's rudimentary. The only people calling the project a cash grab are sad btc bag holders. How do you think these organizations are developing Lightning? They're raising capital from people. 
The idea that Bitcoin is the be-all, end-all is lunacy.
@_date: 2019-04-25 21:23:01
It was this way from the start. Brave originally used Bitcoin, but the platform was unable to function due to slow speeds, high fees, and uncertainty with scaling. They moved to Ethereum because it was a better option. 
I don't see how Bitcoin can perform any of the functions of BAT better.

I think you're trying to have a different argument. Whether BTC is a "good store of value" is open for debate. However, I can factually demonstrate that it can store and retrieve value. 
Scan over [this]( and I think you will find a varying definition of what a store of value is. 
Currently, I can exchange something of value for BTC. I can hold that BTC, and at a later date I can exchange that BTC for something else of value, often a fiat currency. While the price may change, BTC itself does not depreciate in form or function. This is the fundamental definition of a store of value. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:04:47

I think you are grossly out of your element here. You're reliance on snippets from wikipedia demonstrate this. You have not made a logical case. At this very moment, Bitcoin literally functions as a store of value. I can buy, hold, exchange and sell. This has been true since day one. Why you choose to ignore reality is beyond me. 


This refers to the depreciation of the asset itself, not it's price point. This is why milk and beer aren't used as a store of value, because they depreciate. Jesus, lol. 


There is no asset or item in existence that maintains its value. Your argument is moot. The average lifespan of a fiat currency is approx thirty years. The US dollar loses value every year, and only maintains a fraction of it's former buying power.

Electronics do go bad. This is why people throw them away and replace them. What plantet are you on, son? 
A building is not a store of value. Buildings fall apart and they get destroyed. Real estate as a store of value refers to the parcel of land. Property lines do not degrade or fall apart. They persist, and thus can retain value. My god man, with every example you bring up, it is clear you don't understand it. Are you just furiously googling things in hopes to save yourself in this discussion?

The advantage is profit. Many altcoins have been highly profitable. Trading altcoins can greatly increase your BTC stack. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:43:59
You are incorrect my good man. Bitcoin, in it's current state, is a speculative store of value. Yes, it can be used to purchase goods and services, but that does not make it a capable currency. A currency must be fungible and stable. Bitcoin is neither of those things. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 11:33:29
Please buddy, just stop. Repeating the same false info won't change anything. Your first rebuttal makes it clear that you don't understand what it means to be a store of value. A changing price does not prevent something from being a store of value.

Wikipedia is not an academic source. You have provided no text book information corroborating your ideas, and you have linked zero research or analytical papers published by economists. 
All of your ideas are discredited by reality. They don't require appeals to authority or randomly linking to wikipedia. You persist with your beliefs despite actual events, which are taking place at this very moment, and which directly contradict your statements. While you're at it, you might as well claim the Earth is flat, and link to some guy's blog as evidence.

It literally does. What part of this are you not understanding? Bitcoin stores value in the exact same way as gold, only it has a higher velocity. 


No, they don't. If they were predictable, you would have made your billion dollars already and wouldn't be sitting on reddit getting destroyed in this argument. 


No, it does not. 




USD has lost [almost 90%]( of it's value, and it's an established, government backed currency. BTC declined by 70%, *AFTER* experiencing massive, massive gains, and it's a bleeding edge technological asset. 
Holy fuck man, you're so stubborn you can't see blatant facts. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:01:47
Yes, there can, and there is. The concepts are not mutually exclusive. This is exactly what Bitcoin is. In it's current form, BTC only exists as a secure, digital store of value. Most users are purchasing, mining, and holding BTC as a speculation based on the hope that adoption and use will drive the price up. 
If you have an alternative understanding, please share it.

Holding bitcoin at this point is the opposite of de-risking.

This is irrelevant. A valid argument requires valid sources. If it did not, than anyone could cite any random web page as a source. Wikipedia is a free-forum. It is not considered a valid source. In fact, Wikipedia itself has a disclaimer stating that it is not a valid source. 


This is literally a property of Bitcoin. You need to remove the false notion that a store of value retains a "constant value," because it does not.  


Once again, this only reinforces the point. It is fair to argue about whether Bitcoin is a reliable store of value, as some assets are more reliable than others. However, this does not negate the literal functions of Bitcoin. 


You have done no such thing. You have posted a few snippets which only reinforce the idea that Bitcoin is a store of value, albeit a less predictable one. 


Note the key word, "proper". Yes, Bitcoin is a non-traditional store of value. You really picked the worst possible example though. Krugman has been hilariously wrong about several things such as, The fucking internet (LOL!), the Euro, deflation, unemployment, the recession, etc. How this man won a Nobel prize is a mystery. He has a long list of egregious errors. You should pick some better people to use as examples. 
You shouldn't rely on an appeal to authority. You should be able to demonstrate your argument with facts. For instance, I can factually show you how Bitcoin functions, and thus I can demonstrate how it falls under the definition of a store of value. 


But, I have. Bitcoin can (and has since it's inception) allow someone to purchase it, hold it, and at a later time exchange it for products, services, or fiat. In fact, it's a digital equivalent of gold, but with less friction.

In the same comment, you said scaling is being worked on by ~2 people, and that scalling is being worked on by  "a plethora of people". Certainly you see the contradiction? 
Im any event, the truth is scaling is being worked on by numerous developers.

It's only your presumption, until proven.

Milk goes bad, alcohol goes bad, wheat goes bad. These are not a store of value. No item or asset in existence holds the same value. Every currency in history has crashed. You might be the dumbest person I've ever conversed with on Reddit.

I am announcing that my personal crypto, which I created in my moms basement, is now the real bitcoin. My mom says it matches satoshi's vision better. It comes equipped with all sorts of bugs, errors and maliability issues because updating technology is dumb and everything should remain the exact way it was without improvement.

Do you have any evidence? Your account closure could be for numerous reasons. Many friends bank with PNC and use GDAX without any problem.

In some cases yes, but if everyone did that we had have very little liquidity, and that would hurt the price.

You need a deep order book for good liquidity.

Which activities of Coinbase have been proven fraudulent?
It sounds like you made a transaction that violated or triggered the BSA.
