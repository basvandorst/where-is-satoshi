ooooooh, yeah baby, inside a vagina...what....what is that like?
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:41:26
Nah I'll just wait till I'm rich then cash out then I'll buy the coffee company, you work with your "bcash" and let's come back in a year and see who owns a store and who is working there.

I tell people I'm retired. Which I am.  other than that it's below me to speak of my money to people.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:11:07
I'm storing my coin till they are worth near half a million each then I'm cashing them out, dodging my taxes and buying guns.  I'm sick of these posts telling me how to and what to do.  I'm going to do whatever I want.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:44:19
Spread it among friends and family.  I got a lot of them.  Small amounts don't trigger anything and I already own my property, house, cars and big item things.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:05:13
it was 2 years in the Army, I joined at 18.  I still wish someone would "give" me bitcoin, I don't see how they are related.

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:41:21
I'm just covering silly expenses like fuel for vehicle, sodas, beer and snack food and shit that nobody can ever trace.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:47:22
Nothing can be taken from me, you know nothing.  If you don't exist and you don't own anything, then they can't take shit away from you.  The house, the cars, bank accounts, shit even the bills to this house aren't in my name.  Take WHAT away from me? WHAT Xbox?  That Xbox legally belongs to Timmy, my friend, so you can't take that.  You just aren't seeing the light and you would rather live making decisions based in fear, where I have NO FEAR and therefore am free to do as I please.  Wake up man, they just take what they want from you, are you going to let them?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:19:46
Nobody but me and the wife know it exists.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:19:04
Wow that's amazing.  Wish someone would give me bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:15:42
you're retarded and I call bs that you even own shit
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:34:06
stop telling me what to do with my money.  These posts are bossy, snobby and full of shit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:47:35
Not if you stay under the reporting threshold.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:16:31
I got to Vegas once a year and gamble with a couple grand, this is just a longer term, more ludicrous gamble to me.  Don't worry about me, worry about you, I'm good bro.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:08:15
So what.  I got mine.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:17:54
I refuse to let fear into my life in any way shape or form, only losers make decisions based on fear.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:52:02
It literally said down for maintenance also, they warned us all week.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:39:22
Jealousy can make you sick like a disease, I hope yours gives you brain cancer.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:15:14
I wish it would dip that low, but it won't
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:45
Bought it all anon as fuck, they can come after my money with guns if they feel froggy.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:36:46
People sell USD for other currencies all the time, it's actually an entire market and subset of investing.  Jesus fucking christ....
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:00:36
Send coin from wallet to friend/family, make sure it's under 6k as to not trigger any alerts. Pay friend a cut.  Walk away with laundered money.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:58:26
Nothing is in my name.  I technically own nothing.  I never attached my real name or ID to anything.  I'm a total scumbag and I don't care because I'm going to be loaded.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:32:30
meh, not worried.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:18:29
That, I can get behind!
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:35:13
Beanie babies.  Pet Rock.  Apple Stock.  The longer you live the more things you missed.  The funny thing about regret is, it's better to regret the things you have done, than the things you haven't done.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:32:13
nobody will notice a couple grand a year.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:38:43
the cancer being spread here are all govt shills from the fed. The Fed is SCARED, the jews that own the country are SCARED and they fucking should be.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:12:52
Whatever it is it's made me rich.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:49:43
I don't own any equity or things.  I do however have a lot of cash and never need to worry about food/rent/bills being paid.  Nobody knows how much cash you have as long as you don't go around bragging and showing off.  Especially since I live in a very small town in the middle of nowhere moutains in Co.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:56:40
Yup, I'm sorry but the whole reason I got into my lifestyle was to keep the US from gaining ANYTHING off me.  Bitcoin and black market has ensured that I live like a king without supporting the regime, fuck society, fuck the US and fuck everyone but me
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:40:36
Still holding dude.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:12:55
Yeah those underpaid, understaffed IRS workers are going to waste resources going after a few thousand, I think not.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:19:33
they can have it after they kill me
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:03:53
I barely exist, I'm not on the radar and nobody will waste the resources to chase me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:11:42
Everything I do is possibly risking jail time, fuck the man, fuck society fuck the rules :)  We good bro, but thanks for caring.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:14:04
its about the future of money and how it's going to be handled, not letting the fucking jews own our country like a corporation, I wonder how jealous you will be when it DOESN'T lose value.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:42:26
Then don't believe me, fuck off.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:13:10
Shill alert.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:29:22
The "equity" is all in family or friends names, but I have the keys and I live in it.  The cars are also titled in other people's names.  I am cashing out chunks of bitcoin with friends and family to avoid paying taxes.  Never mentioned anything about "tropical bank accounts" You are stalking two people at once (  Having a couple hundred thousands, IS loaded, especially if you don't pay taxes on it.  Are you jealous?  You want to AMA?  I'll assure you that I'm real.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:22:33
The jews?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:40:18
Fuck everyone but me
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:38:48
Fear controls this pussy, don't be a pussy like him.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:29:48
fuck off shills
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:12:10
Yeah those underpaid, understaffed IRS workers are gonna waste time hunting me over a couple grand in taxes.  I think not.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:37:34
I fucking know.  But jealousy is a shitty way to handle this buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:41:38
Because the IRS shills have invaded all social media.  Social media has been weaponized against the citizens, they want us stressed out, fearful and angry because we spend more money when we are.  Everyone should dodge as much personal income tax as they possibly can because its flat out illegal and unconstitutional and immoral.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:20:55
fuck you I'll maximize my profits at whatever the cost.  I got shit to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:42:32
Fuck rappers!
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:18:33
They can't do a fucking thing, they are understaffed and underpaid, they won't waste money or resources or manpower or time going after a bitcoin dude when celebrities and political people are such easy targets.  Nobody is buying a 10mil home with bitcoin and not expecting to pay some taxes, but you can live a life of luxury under the radar and never draw the attention of the fucking jew run IRS
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:27:38
And thanks for that man because of you I've made 10's of thousands of dollars!
