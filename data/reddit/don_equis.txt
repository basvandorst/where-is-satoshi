It is one of my favorites for a very different reason. I'm always thinking "oh, this could be generalized this way, or this can be done, etc" and when I read that I feel stupid.

You can't do that. You need access to the federation's private keys to do that and only federators have access to those.

The peg works like this:
* There's a spv wallet in the RSK mainchain called "bridge". This wallet will be updated by the federation.
* To move btc into rsk, you send from a P2PKH address money into the Federation address (P2SH). Then a pmt prooving your tx is sent to the bridge, and that will transfer sbtc (rsk coin) into the corresponding rsk account. This account is deduced from the P2PKH's public key UTXO spent. So you'll need to use the same private key you used to send money into rsk to spend the money once inside.
* To move money from rsk to btc, you send the money from your `personal` account (not a contract) to the bridge. This will generate a btc tx moving that amount into the corresponding P2PKH that will be signed by the federation. Again, you'll need to keep your private key on btc to spend the money.

I think that the federators list will be made public anytime soon. While there will be an onchain mechanism for federators to vote for adding or removing federators, how they will be selected is up to them. At the beginning RSK will decide them. Trusting them is up to you. You can trust them the same way you can trust an exchange. Though the federation will be formed by multiple parties and as long as you trust the 50% you can trust the federation.

Yes. You can also hardfork RSK and adapt to basically any change. Depends what are the change in the hardfork it will require different changes on RSK. For example, a change on the PoW mechanism will require the same change on RSK spv wallet contract.

It's based on the Ethereum VM and the implementation is a fork of Ethereumj

**Third party risks?**
Currently RSK is a federated chain, which implies that funds locked into RSK are under the custody of the federators, which implies trusting them.
**How is it pegged to the BTC blockchain?**
I explained it here: 
Feel free to ask for additional details.
By the way, sBTC are released ONLY if BTC are locked, which guarantees the 1:1 ratio
**How is rootstock different from ETH?**
At the beginning it is related to being a side chain and merge mined. But with time there will be more differences. Each network will develop different ways of scaling, ETH will move into PoS, etc. 
**Does rootstock make ETH redundant?**
This is not a technical question, but my opinion is that it does not. I believe that the crypto world can growth on multiple directions and ETH and RSK will probably take different ones.

The main two differences IMO are that there's no subsidy for mining rsk blocks besides txs fees and rsk is merge mined, which should imply that you can mine both btc and rsk at the same time with no additional cost.

It prints the public key on one side and the private on the other in QR.

Hi. I haven't read the paper yet, but afaik Simplicity is turing incomplete and all the info for the execution is in the tx, which implies that there's no global state. So I don't relaly know how some stuff can be done using simplicity.
Sorry for the lack of answer.

I imagine. Turing completeness is theoretically needed only for weird tasks after all, but the way I usually uses conditional jumps and common turing complete related stuff. Which means that I don't know how to work here.


EVM is turing complete. Saying that gas limits makes it incomplete is like saying that non computer is turing complete because there are limited resources. It's a really boring observation.


I'm pretty sure it is. I just need the paper for a proper comparison. I never tried to say that Simplicity is bad nor RSK is better.


Drivechains! That'd be awesome.

It is a federated 2 way-peg merge mined sidechain with support for evm style smart contracts for bitcoin.
It means:
* Sidechain: It is a blockchain and you can send btc to it and use its functionality and later recover the btc on the bitcoin blockchain
* Merge Mining: RSK blocks can be mined along with bitcoin with expected no Hashing power lost for bitcoin.
* Federated 2 way-peg: there will be no new currency on RSK, it will use bitcoin. Though moving founds in RSK and out from RSK will require trusted third parties called federators.
* EVM style smart contracts: all the research and develop of the turing complete smart contracts of ethereum can be applied here.

My funds have been frozen because I don't have one of the documents they ask me for. I didn't deposit value, someone transferred me it through the xapo app and I can't give him it back.
