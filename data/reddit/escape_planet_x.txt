I'm a outsider to this, watching with my meager investments.
I stopped mining back when CPU mining went out..
But all I get is that btccore is going to force a hardfork. This isn't some corporate entity that will "play nice" this is the unruly mob that makes up open source software. We will fucking do what we want with the code. If the developer won't fix it, someone else will fork it and that fork will take off like wildfire leaving the original in its dust.
That is what WILL happen, it's happened in *nix over and over again. (And will happen again!)
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:27:53
It will be bozo.
Let me paint you a picture.
You are of a 50% group that decides BTC goes to 1mb.  
The other 50% group wants 2mb transactions.  
Group 2 creates a new fork, and starts using it.
One of those two is a altcoin now, and the "primary" is bitcoin still.
Whoever has the larger % wins.
Lets not degrade perfectly good conversations with baseless insults, especially when said baseless insults make you look like a bozo. =)
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:46:46
lol.. yah that isn't how it works kid.
You'll show up with your 1mb if everyone else has agreed 2mb+ is what BTC is, and try and use it...  
And you'll look like that 1 dork upset he can't buy coffee with his 30,000 dogecoin.

Lets break this down since you seem to be having a lot of trouble with it.


Half? You missed what I said it seems so I'll copy paste and bold it. **Its in your best interest not to be detected as 150% over the course of a few days is not as effective as 70% over the course of a year.**


... which is exactly what we are discussing. If you don't think those mining botnets don't hold a large chunk of the various altcoins you need to read more on the security side of things. (I'm pretty sure theres even an article I can point you to from a series of surge and dips from litecoin mining to another alt coin that is obviously a botnet moving its attention from one side to the other.)


That's just ignorant. It doesn't matter if its your responsibility or not. We should still be observant and informed.

@_date: 2014-07-04 02:54:07
Yah.. you aren't a botnet programmer.
There are multiple variants that effectively hide from the user by attempting to take precautionary measures against alerting them.
For instance, I would have to search for its name again since they are always stupidly named.  
It did something like, wait for the screensaver to go off and even allow the computer to sleep the harddrive. Set a timer for 10 min.
Wake everything but the screen up and start mining coins. -&gt; if interrupted it added a entry at that time so that it would try and sleep around it.  
If you opened anything that recorded processes or similar it wouldn't launch at all..  
And uh.. no one is waving away resistance being real, but that its pointless. Its only resistance if they can overcome the barrier its rather moot since its a matter of money and time - of which some people and organizations have a lot of.

You have no clue what your talking about man. There are several botnets merrily mining away right now doing exactly as I described and they are exceedingly effective at evading the notice of your average computer user (or you know it wouldn't be as prevalent?)
Who fucking cares if you don't use 100% of your mining power its goddamn free! Someone else is paying for it, 10% 150% its still free either way. Its in your best interest not to be detected as 150% over the course of a few days is not as effective as 70% over the course of a year.

Here we go with the fucking "Hard forks are dangerous" line again.
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:42:50
I don't grasp how that isn't a hardfork. If the old clients never update they still only see the 21M original max. When we get to the 21M.1 coin, the old network won't accept it. That is a hardfork to me, since at that point the two networks utterly diverge. Yes the new one will continue to accept transactions from the old system. But the old system will outright fucking ignore the newly minted coins.
That to me is what separates the two. So.. no I don't see how they are alike. With at least Segwit, they can be utterly ignored by the old client and nothing changes beyond the size of the network transactions. The example you provide is doing something the old network will NOT accept.
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:06:16

Hi buttcoiner. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 01:07:31
A soft fork will still fail and do nothing if the network doesn't come to consensus. Just like a hardfork, it just won't create a separate chain.
It'll just do nothing.
Segwit could be implemented right now by BTCon github and increase the cap to 210\^100btc. 
But since no one would ever download and run his version of segwit with the new cap. It wouldn't matter. The only "change" is his changes would fail gracefully and his changes to the client would have no impact outside of some bloated code that should get commented out.
I really don't see a vast difference between the two and think this is a pointless argument that entirely misses what we as a community should be focused on.*
@_date: 2016-02-11 12:20:14
Which is why I watch these threads with increasing disappointment.  
This is rarely a discussion. For some reason one side is automatically the "enemy" because they don't agree with another parties opinion.

They can't put math back in the bottle. You just can't.
All it takes is some notes in a notebook to pass the concept, or in this case a decently sized PDF.
They can squash the network, but they can't stop the concept itself. If they break it, it will rise up from the ashes renewed just like the P2P services have. 
The more you attack it, the more robust it gets.
(Please note, I'm a long long tail better, BTC itself is interesting. The consequences are far more fascinating to me. This next 85 years is going to be the fastest we've ever moved technologically. The results of this can only be vaguely speculated. As you have stated, those in power are fighting to retain control though it frightens me at times as to how far they seem to be willing to bet themselves..)

The gist of it is. Free transations get processed so long as there are a minimal number of bytes required to transmit. 
So your  .10¢ might take a few hours to a day? (there's a point the transaction gets canceled) but its fine so long as its not  a ton of dust from a bunch of different coins... (someone correct me if I'm wrong on that part) or more important a large transaction of multiple addresses. (takes longer and is much more likely to get rejected by the network)

We can produce more... Fusion at a cost will make all the helium you are willing to pay for (it can be a bi product to some other refining goal)

Very few hardware manufacturers are willing.

One step at a time kids.

I work in IT this problem still exists for computers. Some people will just choose to be left behind. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 01:22:40
Thats what these largely seem to be, hopefully restrictions on unbacked trades will slow this idiocy down. 
@_date: 2013-08-11 21:16:45
Install it. And using root separate them from the app store. (I do it all the time, as well as break certain apps ability to phone home.) get titanium backup do the same. then uninstall gapps. And backup your apps.

Ok.. And what would stop us from building a client? 
@_date: 2013-11-15 12:12:34
That only works if its linked to the play store.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:40:05
I wouldn't worry about it. Verify that you got the address correct and walk away for a bit.

12 if my math is right

They are both temporary and still cheaper and faster than most credit merchants. 
Obviously they lack certain fraud protections, but on the same hand btc also removes the possibility of other forms of credit related fraud. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:50:22
So.. Exchange 100% and enjoy the savings? 
Or you can ignore it. I know I don't really care. Especially if you aren't seeking discussion. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 16:00:50
Mind you so long as your phrase is strong, you are reducing it to like 100 quintillion guesses which for the time being is still an absurd #

$30 here. But that's only because my bank knocks off $15 for who I know.

I would guess you're the kid, if that is the best counter you have.

Meh. ASIC elitists? 
A. Pools will get bigger, and if the value is there the... value will be there (if its worth it, they will spend) 
B. is that way.
Edit clarity.

Like the idea, hate the name. Sounds like a jest alt coin.

This is still a free market no one is forcing us to use mtgox and no one can stop us from letting it wither and die.

Confirmation bias whooo!

Or just stop trying to evade your taxes and actually find productive ways to change your country.

Basically look and see if anyones gotten it together yet (recent idea for btc) 
But do little task earn a little coin. Talking .10¢ little.

Have you found an easy way to add postgre sql for the android?
I've not the complete knowledge of how to rebuild the libraries needed for ARM capable Postgre - and my digging around hasn't recently yielded any results...
I'm not even sure why you deleted your comment though.

Is someone producing faux coins? 
No? Then bitcoin wasn't hacked. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:21:39
No, what that guy is describing is exactly what a market related panic is. Bitcoin wasn't crashing until the lag delayed orders and everyone panicked and dropped the price by 6$ instead of even trying to assess the situation.
He was trying to protect his investment, that isn't dumb, but don't deny that the sort herd behavior described above doesn't lead to market panics.
@_date: 2013-07-10 14:28:25
Bingo! Because this and every other fucking article written about this. Has absolutely nothing to do with seizure, someone gave the DEA bitcoins for drugs and now they intend to keep them.
Its easier to just down vote iwillnotbiteyourdog, since he's just a damn ad bot. 
@_date: 2013-08-11 18:22:19
Root it and load a custom rom. Depending on your phone, some not all have pretty much pure open source. 
And you can change a lot by compiling your own. (including beefing security up)

You seem lost boy, is that way.

Follow the bitcoin tipbot link, it explains how to send your coins to a wallet in your control.

Nope don't bother is leaking and there is nothing you can do to stop it.

If you store all your wealth in one place.. its easy for people to steal.
See any physical object that is worth something.
(cars, cash, metals)
Stop being stupid, this and all these other arguments have been thrown around over and over again. No, rehashing it for the Nth time isn't going to convince anyone you are right.
You are your own bank. If you have stupid practices in storage, well then stop!
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:50:05
I'm a bit curious as well.

If anyone even briefly takes this looney toon seriously for even one second, please check his user history before putting any value in his statements. (hint: he may be a paranoid delusional)

I did the same for a pointless government assignment. Literally copy this chapter.
So I did in mirror writing.. because I was bored as hell, for the entire semester, got 0's on them all. 
At the end of the year he said if I resubmitted them all I could get an A.
I got that in writing..
So I photocopied them and mirrored them back (With his photocopy account muwhahahahah). He was not pleased, but probably knew it wasn't worth fighting over since I had the agreement in writing.
@_date: 2013-04-05 10:18:43
Heh, I'm with you man. You should see I didn't believe in the Krugbots.. not at first anyway.
The reaction to bitcoin is fascinating. Who are these people, and why are they so scared of it that they lash out at it?
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:07:21
Um, welcome to the reality of being responsible for things you are in control of...?
Insecure infrastructure? You mean you trusted an unverified third party without recourse and got burned? Go buy some burn ointment.

At least someone got it.

Its 600 on mtgox now. Other exchanges are catching up.
