What evidence do you cite?

“Well first of all, tell me: Is there some society you know that doesn’t run on greed? You think Russia doesn’t run on greed? You think China doesn’t run on greed? What is greed? Of course, none of us are greedy, it’s only the other fellow who’s greedy. The world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests. The great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus. Einstein didn’t construct his theory under order from a bureaucrat. Henry Ford didn’t revolutionize the automobile industry that way. In the only cases in which the masses have escaped from the kind of grinding poverty you’re talking about, the only cases in recorded history, are where they have had capitalism and largely free trade. If you want to know where the masses are worse off, worst off, it’s exactly in the kinds of societies that depart from that. So that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear, that there is no alternative way so far discovered of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by the free-enterprise system.” 
― Milton Friedman

This is the constant pull and push on the bitcoin ecosystem. There are too many corrupt individuals who hurt the systems integrity

Funny how Andresen has been keeping a low profile since Lombrozo brought forth key corruption information on him. I am sure he will emerge from the depths at some point
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:09:24




from [this article on BBC](
Oh! They apologized for their corruption. Everything is fine now so we can rest now that the situation is solved.
