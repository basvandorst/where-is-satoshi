Read my EDIT . 
@_date: 2016-01-12 14:14:13
Some very good answers here , and to the ones asking me why do i want to do that instead of just keeping the money in the form of USD . 
Reason  : Suppose i receive a payment( a big one) from someone and i don't want to be taxed for that. So what i do is keep them in such services (of course its risky) and take the money whenever i want it ,  rather than pay the tax . 
@_date: 2016-01-12 14:15:41
That is what i was looking for :D

Trust me 70% of the people don't have the patience to wait that long . One jump in the chart and they are already cashing out . Then come to this sub reddit to cry about not waiting . The cycle continues .

I would say it is a transaction medium, to hold the funds not soo much with all this volatility .

Real satoshi chilling at some private island and attention seekers claiming to be him , its fun times .

Damn some fine bitcoins lost for that .
@_date: 2019-04-13 03:01:03
Thats now how it works everytime .

The lesser the mining block rewards get the higher the price will go because more the demand .

Thats is very neat. 
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:15:23
Yeah man been waiting all this time . Will wait some more .
@_date: 2019-09-11 02:42:18
I miss using it as a transaction medium and not a gamble .
