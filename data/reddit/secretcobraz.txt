Cody Wilson as part of Defcad is a Title 2 Firearms manufacturer. They are currently embroiled in a case with the state department. 
When the Liberator was released the state department ordered the takedown of the files. Through the International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), the US Government claims the intellectual property rights to all munitions past, present, and future. 
This includes but is not limited to blueprints, files, manuals, most technical data, oral or verbal disclosure, etc. According to Cody the state department has sat on the case over the last year.

pc builder here, specs are very important no matter what type of system.

I never said XYZ was a bad investment, I was just providing a point of view. 
Value is subjective, but I believe there is a huge difference between perceived value and actual value. 
The Romans paid their soldiers with about a 1/10th of an ounce of Silver for an average working period of 12 hours. 
I'm not a Marxist, I don't really subscribe to any particular school of thought, I like to form my own opinions independent of any established way of thinking, well at the same time taking the latter into account.
Listen to all, follow none is my philosophy.

Let me put it another way. Like paper currencies, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, it's simply code that was nothing that is now worth somthing.  
That is not to say I don't like Bitcoin, I love the idea of a decentralized currency. However, Bitcoin doesn't have any real world uses or intrinsic value (True Wealth) like precious metals. Silver has over 10,000 industrial uses, it's in such constant demand that it's value in inelastic.
Bitcoin and paper currencies have perceived wealth, but no intrinsic value.

Then you have no idea what actual wealth is. You also could benefit from a history lesson. 


Timeless meaning in any time, computers have only existed in the last 50 years of our existence. You can't actually do anything with bitcoin besides use it as a means of exchange.
Silver is the most reflective metal on the planet, it has antimicrobial properties and has the highest thermal and electrical conductivity of any known metal. 
Precious metals like Silver have no counter-party risk, somthing that Bitcoin and other paper currencies suffer from.

"gold and silver would have value even if they had absolutely NO industrial value"
You are right, but what kind of value? Compared to Fiat currencies?  
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:22:29
When I think of Precious metals I don't see them as an investment, or somthing that you just sell off  when the price is high. 
The dollar will eventually collapse, and I would rather have something that has real world uses (Of which Silver has 10,000). It's a very important industrial commodity; No matter what the price is, it is needed for the tech and medical industries to survive. 
The reason I am buying Silver is for it's intrinsic value, not as a commodity to sell off at a higher price. 
Thats why I am very weary of Bitcoins especially considering the latest crash, and MT Gox basically being the most important entity in trading doesn't make Bitcoin very decentralized.
Eventually I might look into it again and I still keep track of what's going on, but if I were to ever buy Bitcoins it would never be too just sell them off at a higher price.

I was talking about the present day, not the history behind it. 
In my opinion, Silver is the way to go to prepare for an economic collapse.

Bitcoin itself is a fiat currency with no intrinsic value. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 19:44:12
To Apple, most tech giants, and parts of the medical supply industry Silver is a 100% necessity, they could not operate without it.
@_date: 2013-09-16 04:00:48
Thats actually a very good point for Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Still outside of that use...
@_date: 2013-09-16 03:30:11
I am not concerned with the trading value of assets, but their intrinsic value. 
Whatever the trading price of silver is, it doesn't change the Antimicrobial or reflective properties of silver.  
@_date: 2013-08-24 14:04:52
Bitcoin is still no replacement for real physical assets.

I would prefer not to barter, however all of the above are important regardless.  
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:37:15
Yes they do.
@_date: 2013-09-16 04:04:21
Yes it does, however Gold and Silver are valued higher compared to fiat currencies because of their scarcity. 
Different metals have different properties, and different industries consume more of a specific type of metal than others. 
Silver's price is inelastic because certain products (Mainly electronics) would not exist without it. If Apple uses a minimum of a 1/10 of an oz of silver in every computer they manufacture (As an example), they have to buy that silver no matter what the price to produce their product. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 03:29:17
I don't care about the value of gold in currencies, I value gold by it's properties and intrinsic value, and Bitcoin does not have intrinsic value. 
As a store of true value, Silver is prefered for it's inelastic industrial value. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 07:34:43
When I talk about intrinsic or industrial valve, Industrial = All For-Profit industries.
Also the history is very important, but I am focusing on the present day. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:18:40
I would strongly recommend against buying into SLVs or mining stocks. For Silver I would stick to physical Bars/Coins. 
"If you don't hold it, you don't own it"  
@_date: 2013-09-15 23:16:50
Gold is a physical asset with real world uses and an industrial demand. I find it hard to compare Bitcoin to gold directly, besides as a medium of exchange. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 19:48:35
When I look for a store of value, I look for value other than the currency trading rates. 
If Silver had no real uses other than jewelry I could care less.
@_date: 2013-09-15 23:30:54
Gold's value in Paper currencies and overall value is suffering that is for sure. 
But Bitcoin will never compare to somthing tangible with real world use; Bitcoin can't be used for electrical or thermal conductivity, or as an antimicrobial agent like Silver. Silver's price is also inelastic because of the huge industrial demand.
When I think of physical assets, I don't think in terms of Dollar amounts, I think of actual use and demand. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:02:53


Actual uses for XYZ are not subjective, this is a fact. Something doesn't have a specific property because someone thinks it does. It's those properties that truly make somthing valuable.
