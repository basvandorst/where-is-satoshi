I think the use of childish language implies that they don’t have any more rational arguments. Hence, good time to buy

Also, he’s including the all the raw oil that eventually produced the gasoline, but not the energy production efficiency losses in his bitcoin estimate.
For a somewhat more fair comparison, a 14 gallon tank of gas has ~1.7TJ of chemical potential energy

This is awesome. Graphs would also be really epic, I’m curious to see whether adoption is linear or parabolic

I don’t think this is a real issue. We already have the option of investing our fiat in things like stocks and bonds that we expect to pay off in the long run. Now, imagine there was a service that offered to manage your money such that as soon as you acquire some it gets invested, and as soon as you want to spend it they pull out juuust the right amount as you swipe your card to pay for whatever you wanted to buy. Great right?
So, what I’m getting at is that we already have the option to make a return on our saved money, but that certainly doesn’t stop us from spending what we want to spend. I don’t see why bitcoin should be any different

Correct use of you’re... correct capitalization of YouTube... but shortening you to u. I find this strangely unsettling

Here’s what baffles me:
If I spend $50 of credit on a fancy meal, that is *definitely* burned money. I am out $50, no ifs ands or buts. Now, is I spend $50 on BTC... even in the worst case scenario where one BTC is literally worthless, that is just equivalent to me having burned the money on something else. So what gives? Why is it less of a risk to let me burn my credit, vs spend my credit on something that might retain some value? Either way I’ll still need to pay them back, and I’ll be strictly better equipped to do so if I didn’t spend it on something irreparably worthless

That’s not how autistic people think. I’m saddened by this comment.

Not manipulative, just a different type of scale that’s useful for viewing exponential trends.
On a linear graph, a rise of $1 will cover the same amount of vertical space on the graph regardless of whether it was a move from $0.1 to $1.1 (1000% change), or $100 to $101 (1% change)
On a logarithmic graph a rise of 1*%* will cover the same amount of vertical space on the graph. Therein lies the magic, because it’s the %movement that drives your gains or losses, not the absolute dollar value of the move.
Neat stuff.

I don’t follow. I feel dumb.

Pretty interesting chart, and it does seem to fit pretty well. Was it just intuition on your part to fit a function of that form, or is there also some background knowledge you could share?
