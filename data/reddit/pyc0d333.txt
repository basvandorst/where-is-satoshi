1. Local currency 
2. Dollar accounts as well( minimum of $50-$100) for opening so not easily accessible to everyone.
But a good percentage do not have bank accounts as well, so mobile money services offered by telcos are very popular as they are easily usable even on feature phones.
Yes, you’re right, at the moment it’s much safer and easier to save monies in local currency but with a middle-class who are increasingly looking into investments, digital assets are something they’re increasingly delving in to.
PS: The correct data might be otherwise, these are my personal observations

For long term investors, volatility not being a problem is something we can agree on.

I run an exchange here in Africa and adoption is mind-blowing. A lady in her 50s purchased $4k worth today. Asked me how she was gonna spread it between her four kids. 
$4k is a lot of money down here, but that’s not new, there are people who buy much more than that. Hoping 2018 becomes even more massive adoption-wise. 
The largest hurdle is lack of liquidity, immediately you tell someone who is skeptical of joining that there will be someone who will buy their bitcoins when they need cash, a huge barrier is crossed and they tend to jump in. 
I don’t have any data but the scene is lively down here. Maybe more media reportage will help ( though a lot of shows now invite crypto guys to come on air)

For those who are familiar with it yes. Some freelance devs also prefer it now. Faster than WU and fills the gap the lack of PayPal or a service like it  has left void.

They will get it the same way they’re getting it now! There are exchanges here ffs.

Hi, lol yes correct. Specifically we’re headquartered in Ghana, but we do deal with some customers in Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda. 
I’ll tell you something man, I’m highly optimistic that a lot of more people will join, and even happier that many I have met are taking time to learn about it, the get rick quick mentality a lot of skeptics attach to it is also getting low ( from my own personal interactions).
Key thing now is more enlightenment and education
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:10:26
Hopeful it will get more adoption this year. Enlightenment of the public is key!

TBH it’s mostly as an investment,  I mean a $50 profit is cool  for someone over here right ? 
I agree with you on the majority not having disposable income .
Most of those in it are the middle income class, especially young workers between 21-40 and interestingly high-school kids �� putting in $5, $10,$20 hoping that someday it becomes something.
So yes, we do see a lot of people buying smaller amounts especially the first time, but it gets higher after that( especially in a bullish market).
But on average, that’s from my personal dealing and observations, it’s usually nothing less than $100/week for individuals. There’s always the occasions guy who pops up to buy $10,$20k etc to also start selling as merchant in most cases.
PS: Most of those in the middle-class have no problem Hodling.

That’s a general thing correct ?
