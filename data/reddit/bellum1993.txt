Hopefully, no. That's part of the scaling debate and keeping the block size low so that as many people as possible can have a full copy of the ledger. Pruned nodes work just as well however, so even if the block size grows to some enormous size in 100 years, you will really only need the last year or two of blocks.

You have it right. The .75 only cost you $750, but it's worth $1500 now, a gain of $750. So you pay 15% (I believe that is the rate) of the $750 gain. Which comes to about $112 in this case.
Also, it's in a first in first out basis, if you bought 1 btc at $1000, and another 1 btc at $2000,  then sell it all  at $3000 you would be taxed 15% of $2000 for the first Bitcoin, then 15% of $1000 for the second Bitcoin.

You don't know how many txs will be added to the mempool before that next block, or when that next block will be found. But if theres, say, 3mb of txs above the 20 sat/byte line, you can expect a 20 sat/byte tx to clear in maybe 35-45 min.

Every 10 minutes a block is mined, the miner who mined the block gets the block reward. In the beginning the block reward was 50 bitcoin every block. The reward cuts in half every 220,000 blocks, roughly every 4 years. Today the block reward is 12.5 bitcoin every block, and in 2020 it will halve again to 6.25. This function asymptotically approaches 21 million coins by 2140. Today the transaction fees already account for a significant portion of the block reward, so my guess is that transaction fees will be more valuable than the new coin reward long before all the coins are mined.

1) Bitcoin's network dwarfs all the others by comparison. There are estimates that say the bitcoin network is 100 times more powerful than the world's top 10 supercomputer's put together. This leads to enormous security and therefore value.
2) Bitcoin is scarce, like gold, there will only ever be 21 million coins. This makes it deflationary in value, as there are more and more people and goods and services, but still the same number of coins, those coins gain more and more purchasing power. Bitcoin is a more useful money than gold because it can be transferred across the internet.

The deflationary nature of Bitcoin is part of it's economic implications, but I think a bigger factor is that you can send money across the world for little to no fees (especially once we get LN and other improvements) and banks will be obsolete. Banks are a safe place to store your money where it can maybe grow a bit in a savings account. But if Bitcoin is increasing in value gradually over time, and you can secure your Bitcoin with a 12 or 24 word phrase you can memorize so it doesn't have to exist physically anywhere, there is no need for banks.
Sound money and individual freedom are the surest way to greatest good.
Inflation is basically the hidden tax. Each dollar brought into the system dilutes all the others, and the banks are there every step of the way getting a cut, generating wealth by just sitting in the middle and passing the paper around.

Carol wants to pay Bob over the Lightning Network. They each send 0.5 Btc to a 2 of 2 multisig account. This means both of them need to sign any transactions releasing money from this account. Before they fund the account, they exchange symmetrical copies of "child" transactions which refund deposits back to Bob and Carol. The "parent" transaction would be the funding transaction, and is only broadcast after the refunding transactions are exchanged and validated. Bob can verify that Carol's signature is valid without Carol revealing her private key by comparing the transaction and the signature against the public key.
The first child (refunding) transaction would look like this:
Bob's Copy: (1a): 
    output 1: 0.5 to Bob, spendable in 1000 blocks.
    output 2: 0.5 to Carol, spendable now.
Carol's copy (1b):
    output 1: 0.5 to Carol spendable in 1000 blocks.
    output 2: 0.5 to Bob spendable now.
Once the parent transaction has been confirmed on the network, and Bob and Carol agree that their respective copies of the child refund transaction are valid and agreeable, they have a payment channel open. If Bob broadcasts his copy of the refund, Carol may spend her half immediately, but Bob has to wait 1000 blocks. Likewise if Carol wants to close the channel, Bob can spend his half immediately, but Carol has to wait 1000 blocks. They may now use this new feature to exchange new child transactions each which invalidate the old ones. Here's how:
A new child transaction may look like this, if Carol wanted to pay Bob 0.1 Btc:
Bob's Copy: (2a): 
    output 1: 0.6 to Bob, spendable in 1000 blocks.
    output 2: 0.4 to Carol, spendable now.
    (If 1b is broadcast by Carol, Bob may spend output 1 of (1b) immediately, but Carol has to wait 1000 blocks.)
Carol's copy (2b):
    output 1: 0.4 to Carol spendable in 1000 blocks.
    output 2: 0.6 to Bob spendable now.
    (If 1a is broadcast by Bob, Carol may spend Bob's output 1 of (1a) immediately, but Bob has to wait 1000 blocks.)
In this way, once Bob and Carol have signed and exchanged transactions 2a and 2b, 0.6 to Bob and 0.4 to Carol is the true balance of the payment channel. If Carol then tries to broadcast the old transaction 1b, Bob can spend his 0.5 from 1b which Carol broadcast, and he can also use the new, valid transaction 2a to sweep Carol's funds from 1b before she can get them after 1000 blocks.
Using these time locks and the fact that each new transaction reveals the outputs of the old transactions, each party is encouraged to cooperate.
Lightning network transactions can be done in chains, in other words you can pay someone you don't have a payment channel with by paying them through a payment channel owned by someone else who in turn has one with your final destination. For example, Alice has a payment channel with Bob, and Bob has a payment channel with Carol.
If Alice want to pay Carol, Carol creates a secret R and hashes it to H. Carol then gives H to Alice. Alice gives Bob a transaction that says Bob gets 0.1 BTC in Alice/Bob's payment channel if Bob can supply the R which hashes to H. Bob then gives a transaction to Carol which says Carol gets 0.1 in Bob/Carol's payment channel if Carol can supply the R which hashes to H. Carol knows R, and tells Bob, so she has effectively been paid by Alice through Bob. If Carol broadcasts this transaction to the network, she reveals R to Bob, and Bob can use R to get paid by Alice. But instead of broadcasting the transaction she got from Bob, she holds onto it along with the secret R which unlocks it, and accepts it as payment. Alice can then pay Carol again by repeating the process, and it can even go backwards. Bob can charge a small transaction fee, and Bob can even charge Alice negative fees to pay Carol, if Bob happens to pay Alice a lot.
The lightning network leads to unimaginable off-chain scaling because a virtually unlimited number of transactions can occur on a payment channel once the initial funding transaction has been confirmed on the network. A payment channel only consists of two on-chain transactions, one to open the channel and one to settle the final balance. Transactions are very small, 500 bytes at the largest. Using the lightning network effectively allows users to send a very large number of very tiny payments for little to zero fees.

Super happy you watched that video, I think it's the best one out there right now, and I've seen pretty much all of them.
The hardest part of getting into bitcoin is dealing with fiat. The fastest (but most expensive) way to buy some bitcoin is to find a bitcoin atm in your area. If you're buying a small amount, most won't even ask for any id, just put in your cash, it will have a camera to scan a qr code on your phone to your wallet, and zip zap zoop you'll have your bitcoin when it gets confirmed by the network. The downside is that bitcoin atms typically charge a hefty fee 15% - 20% in my experience.
The cheaper alternative is to use an exchange. They will link to your bank account and you can deposit money into the exchange. It will take 5 business days to transfer. Then they hold your dollars until you're ready to exchange for bitcoin. Other exchanges like coinbase allow you to buy at the price when you initiate the transfer, and you receive the coins when the funds go through. I use the exchange Gdax which is part of coinbase.
One important thing to keep in mind is that when you first buy the bitcoin, they are held by the exchange, and you need to send them to your personal wallet for them to truly be under your sole ownership. This will cost a transaction fee on the bitcoin network to send to your wallet.
As far as choices for wallets, if you're confident your phone is secure i recommend breadwallet for ios and mycelium for android. If you're interested in paper wallets, I believe that involves using a pc not connected to the internet, booting from a clean os on a usb, and printing them off on a non-wifi printer plugged in locally.
The safest option of all for holding a large amount of bitcoin is a hardware wallet, check out the Trezor or the Ledger Nano S.
Hope this helps! I'm happy to answer any questions.

Essentially, everything in the parenthesis saying Bob can spend Carol's old outputs but Carol has to wait IS Carol's private key for that old output. The new child transactions contain the private keys to the old transactions, and the fact that it exists allows Bob to redeem it immediately. But if the old transactions are never broadcast, only the valid balance is redeemed, to avoid having the other party sweep all of the funds from the channel.


I imagine this could be automated. A channel being closed would probably be a big deal, you would get all sorts of messages, emails, texts, whatever your preference. It doesn't take much bandwidth to send your transaction, and you could easily just have it sweep the funds automatically if someone tries to use an old transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:31:36
Bob doesnt have to fund the channel, he can let just Alice fund it. But if he doesn't put any funds in on the funding transaction, he can't pay Alice until Alice pays him. And he can't pay Alice more than she has paid him.
If Bob wants to pay Alice through the payment channel but he doesn't have enough funds, he would have to broadcast a new funding transaction.

Mycelium uses an HD wallet, so you have one master private key that holds all the private keys you'll ever need. When you do a transaction, it creates a new "sub" key and sends the change of the transaction to that address. That way each time you send money it's from a new address, which is just good practice in Bitcoin anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:15:22

It may drop in value if it gets banned in a big nation like China or the US, sure, but people all around the world, including in the country it was banned would still be using it. You can't just hand wave it away. To completely get rid of bitcoin you would have to delete every single copy of the blockchain on every computer running bitcoin software all over the world. Even if you shut down the internet bitcoin transactions could be broadcast using shortwave radio bursts.
Have you researched what happened during the prohibition? It didn't stop the people who wanted alcohol from getting it. Same goes for just about anything that is illegal today. Making something illegal doesn't do anything except prevent honest and misinformed people from using it.
If a government makes something like bitcoin illegal, something which empowers its citizens to have full control over their money, I would hope those citizens would wake up and realize just what kind of government they have. Governments do not ultimately rule people. People rule governments. People ARE governments. And historically, when enough is enough, the people rise up and overthrow their corrupt governments.

The only case where a faster internet connection helps is if you have low latency. Blocks are created every 10 minutes or so. Once the block is found, that's only half the battle, the block also has to be shared across the network. This is where low latency helps, the faster and more nodes you can get that block to, the better chance you have of someone working on your block will find the block that comes after it.
But as far as raw computation, actually finding the blocks, internet speed doesn't affect that at all.

Depressions are good long term. They weed out less efficient, less necessary industries. Those that can afford to cut some spending, lower prices, and maybe layoff a few workers and still make a profit will survive.

Just like anything else, the price depends on supply and demand. There is a limited supply of Bitcoin, there will never be more than 21 million. This makes it deflationary by nature, meaning in a growing economy, it grows in value. This is the opposite to an inflationary currency, which we are used to. The fed and central banks control the money supply so that the money supply grows matching the growing economy. As a result a dollar buys the same amount, or less goods over time.
Deflationary currencies benefit savers because it increases savings, inflationary currencies benefits debtors because it reduces their real debt.
Demand for Bitcoin is increasing because it has shown its resiliency to an array of different threats. Bitcoin is shifting from being a collectible, to being a unit of account, to eventually being a fully fledged currency and store of value.

I recommend you check out Debt: The First 5000 years by David Graeber. He's an anthropologist and the University of London. He debunks the myth barter was a primary means of exchange in ancient times. Barter did happen, of course, but debt came first and was more common. If your neighbor had a cow you really wanted, he would just give it to you, with the shared but unspoken understanding that you "owed him one." Debt in this form is probably older than writing itself. Through laws and specific fines debt was easier to count and compare mathematically.
Barter happened only with strangers, or people you would probably never see again. The "spot" trade it is called. For most other things, you just opened a tab, and payed them when your harvest came in, or whenever your trade allowed you to repay them.

It is extremely easy for anyone to start accepting bitcoin. Simply download an app on your phone and someone can pay you. Bitcoin is on an exponential growth path, as it is held in more and more hands, it has more value and less volatility. It will take time for it to proliferate, but if we double users every year, we will serve more than all the banks combined in 10 or 12 years. Compare downloading an app to getting a checking account at a bank. There are 4.5 billion people with limited access or no access to banks, but they could easily be reached with cell towers or satellite phones and mesh networks. Heck, bitcoin transactions can be sent with shortwave radio!
The way I see it, your dollars in the bank are less secure because you have no idea how big your slice of the pie really is. With bitcoin, you know that there will never be more that 21 million coins, and can price it accordingly. With a population of 7.5 billion, that's 2.8 mBtc per person. And bitcoin is secured by the single largest collection of computing power. About 100 times more powerful than the top 10 supercomputers combined.
Right now new coins being generated go to miners. They also collect transaction fees. Already today the transaction fees account for 20% of the block reward. The idea is that because the supply is limited, demand will drive the price up, and the transaction fees will more than compensate for the decrease (and eventual cut-off) of new coins for the miners.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:42:03
There's about 3,500 bits per person, that is 0.003500 bitcoin. 100T$ divided evenly between 7.5 billion is 13,333. So, hypothetically if Bitcoin replaced ALL liquid money, it could be valued as much as 3.8 million per Bitcoin.

As I said, you can receive transactions if you set up a satellite dish, and if needed you can also send transactions with shortwave radio.

If you plan on storing your bitcoin use breadwallet. Bread wallet stores the private keys on the phones, which means the bitcoin are ONLY in your control. If you lose the device, you can recover the coins on another device with your recovery phrase.
Coinbase is okay, despite the flak it gets sometimes. From my experience everytime they've fucked up, they have recovered.
If you want to use coinbase to buy, I recommend using their exchange GDAX instead. You can ACH transfer from your bank for free, it takes 5 days. Then if you set a limit order on the exchange, you don't have to pay the 1.5% fee that coinbase charges. Gdax charges you for the bitcoin tx to send bitcoin from your gdax wallet to your breadwallet.

Opendime has a tab on it which when opened reveals the private keys so you can spend whatever is on the stick.

But once the dime has been opened, you can't trust that the person who gave it to you didn't copy down the keys, even though there may still be bitcoin in the public address associated with the opendime. It basically functions like physical bitcoin. If the tab hasn't been opened, you can trust that whatever bitcoin in that public address hasn't been spent, and you're the only one with access to those bitcoin.

The first time you start the node up it starts requesting blocks from nodes it is connected to. It checks that the blocks are valid as it receives them, and keeps requesting blocks until all the nodes have no more new blocks to send. Similarly, once the node has an updated blockchain, it will share any new txs it receives with all nodes it is connected to. When the node receives a new block, it validates it, then erases all the transactions in the block from its memory pool.

Option 1 is there were simply no more txs to put in the block. The mempool empties all the time, that's normal.
Option 2 is the miner chose not to include txs with very low fees. Think of it like supply and demand. If miners decide they don't want to accept 5 sat per byte txs, they can "fix" the price to a certain extent. Eventually a miner that does accept low fees will mine the block and include your tx, but if you're paying a low fee, you already know it's not likely a miner will include it anytime soon. That's always the trade off with tx fees.

To answer the first question, why is it so inefficient, it's difficult to find a problem which both solves a meaningful problem and is easily verifiable without redoing too much of the work. Hashing algorithms are wasteful, but they are easy and quick to verify. Banks are also rather wasteful, they employ a lot of people who could spend their time elsewhere in society. Not to mention they steal a great deal of wealth from the poorest in our society. If we could replace the entire banking system with bitcoin I think we would be better off, despite the many computers we would have to run to secure the blockchain.
Irreversible payments are a feature, not a bug. You can send smart transactions also, with escrow capabilities.
To answer the last question, how do we get governments to play along? Well, there's nothing they can actually do to control it. If someone refuses to give up their private keys, the bitcoin cannot be moved or confiscated. It's difficult to envision a future with a separation of money and state because it would require a total paradigm shift, and a huge transfer of wealth, but I would like to see it happen.

Bitcoin mining is very competitive, there are warehouses in China literally full of ASIC computers designed to do nothing but hash as fast and efficiently as possible. Unless your electricity is free, it is unlikely you will get a return on your investment in mining rigs. You would likely have better luck just spending the money you would have spent in Bitcoin mining rigs to just buy Bitcoin.

Banks are leeches. The system is flawed. Our money isn't money, it's debt. If the US tried to pay off its debt, we would run out of money first. It's Keynesian vs Austrian economics. If you want to buy something, save up for it. Or borrow from someone who has real savings. If Bitcoin were ever used globally, it would be deflationary. It would increase in value over time. Imagine that! It encourages people to save and only buy the things they need today, so they can buy the things they really want in a few years. On a planet with limited resources and an ever increasing population, I think it's important that we use a currency that dissuades our rapid consumption.
The current system is flawed, it's very difficult to get any sort of savings snowball rolling. Banks and the Gov steal just enough of our money through inflation that we don't really notice that our savings are basically cut in half every 24 years or so unless it was very wisely invested.                                                              
Banks create money on the spot when you take out a loan, debasing everyone else's money through inflation. They basically have a license from the government to commit fraud.

The more technical expertise you have, the safer you are obviously. I would say the bare minimum someone would need to be 100% sure that what they have is Bitcoin would be to run a full node on your computer, and use phone wallets that only point to your trusted node's IP address.

The work the mining rigs do doesn't really accomplish anything other than make the ledger, really, really secure. The more computers there are running bitcoin mining software, the more difficult it is for a single party to seize control of the network. The value of bitcoin is in the security of the network, and its function as a means of transfering value without the need for a third party, the banks.
What I was getting at in my first comment was that if everyone in the world used bitcoin instead of a bank, we would consume less resources. There are 4.5 billion people that are under banked in the world. 2 billion completely un-banked, the nearest bank is 200 miles away up river. Bitcoin could reach all of them easily and for a fraction of the cost.

Check out the stories about Mt Gox. If you store your bitcoin in an online exchange, you are not in control of your money. If anything ever happens to that exchange, your money is gone. One of the major points of owning bitcoin is being your own bank, and being the only person who has access to you money. Storing your money in an online exchange kind of defeats the purpose of having bitcoin.

Bitcoin is commodity money, like Gold. It has value because it has unique properties, and it is scarce. There is no such thing as intrinsic value. Each person values each thing differently, depending on their needs/values/beliefs. Bitcoin and fiat money are similar in the sense that each individual chooses to accept bitcoin or paper fiat money in exchange for goods and services, but only because they have faith that they will be able to later exchange the currency, bitcoin or fiat, for other goods and services. Namely, that whatever the thing is can serve as a good store of value, and medium of exchange. Fiat money also has value because the government says it does. You can use dollars to pay your taxes, or any fines from the government.
The essential difference between bitcoin and fiat money is that the goverment will ALWAYS print more money, thereby diluting the money supply, and essentially stealing from the public by decreasing the purchasing power of their dollars in savings. Bitcoin can not be copied or duplicated. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin. That's why bitcoin is valuable, it's scarce, like gold. And it serves a unique purpose, direct person to person digital cash. Sound money which cannot be depreciated through inflation.

As more people buy bitcoin, that leaves more and more fiat floating around between those who hold fiat. If we see huge bitcoin adoption and a big price increase, we will probably see hyperinflation in fiat. As bitcoin succeeds more and more, fiat will fall more and more.
Bitcoin is deflationary by nature and would encourage saving rather than over-consumption like the fiat system does. People are afraid of a deflationary spiral because no one will spend their bitcoins if they are always appreciating. This thinking is flawed because people will always buy the essentials, food, water, shelter, transportation, etc, even if it means giving up their bitcoin.

Fractional reserve banking requires lots of people to take out loans in order to work. The big banks and the government WANT you to be in debt. I say, don't spend money you don't have, and if money is loaned, there should be actual risk involved so that lenders don't lend to just anyone.

There's this thing we call the mempool, the memory pool, all of the transactions sitting on nodes on network, waiting to be put into blocks. There may be as much as 5 or 10 MB of transactions in the mempool, but the network only processes about 6 MB every hour on average. Each block, the transactions with the highest fees get included first, regardless of how long they have been in the mempool. I believe if your transaction sits in the mempool for 3 days, it gets canceled and you can try again. Many wallets also let you "double-spend" your money, send a second transaction on top of the old one with a higher fee in case it never gets included in a block, so that the new one actually goes through, but the old one just gets discarded.

Holding bitcoin IS investing. You need to hold your own private keys, though. Not your keys, not your bitcoin. If your bitcoin is in an exchange like coinbase or gemini, then they are in control of your money, not you. The point of bitcoin is monetary sovereignty. If your bitcoin are on a hardware wallet like ledger nano or a trezor, or if the bitcoin are in a mobile wallet like mycelium or samourai, then YOU are the only person in control of your money. Even better if you run you're own full node.

There's likely a QR code that pops up on the POS, the customer scans the QR with their Bitcoin app on their phone, and the QR tells the Bitcoin app how much it needs, and the address it's going to. Then they just hit confirm. The POS will see the transaction basically immediately, and it gets confirmed by the Bitcoin network in about 10 or 15 mins. Once confirmed, the money is ready to be spent by the restaurant.
As far as I know taxes work just like with cash. The company providing the Bitcoin to fiat system for the restaurant may do the taxes for them, otherwise they just need to check the exchange rate, and deduct taxes based on the current exchange of Bitcoin to cash. If the Bitcoin is held long term, you pay capital gains when you exchange it back to USD.

Segwit transactions are smaller than legacy transactions. So sending from a segwit address to another segwit address is strictly cheaper than legacy to legacy or legacy to segwit. Segwit addresses also allow you to do cool segwit stuff like LN.
Eventually you'll probably want to have your bitcoin in segwit addresses, but it's not vital that you do it as soon as possible.
