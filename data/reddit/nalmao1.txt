ISIS specifically profited off oil that was being sold to Turkey, and ISIS doesn't really exist as most people imagine it anymore.

No, it's a matter of horrible implementation. Don't blame the user.

What the hell dude, this is not at all how the Bitcoin community looked a few years back... Now everyone is just about the rising price, higher profits, HODLing, store of value, not about the idea/philosophy that Bitcoin was based on. If you think that VISA/MC/AMEX is the solution, then I just have no words...

How do you decide who is a shill? Does being active in other subreddits, reading other subreddits or getting your updates from multiple sources make you a shill? How can you prove you are not a shill? Why does being a "shill" make everything you say irrelevant? Please reply without ad-hominem or other fallacy. Thank you

That doesn't make sense. The fees are high because there are many transaction on the Bitcoin network, and the current system (especially 1mb non-flexible blocksize limit) causes the mempool to clog up.

Can you explain what you mean by this?


I'm genuinely interested in what problems you mean.
