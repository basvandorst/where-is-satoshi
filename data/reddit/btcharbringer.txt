Anyone can name any sub-units of BTC anything they want as long as the math works, but for the sake of mass-adoption, there is an element of marketing involved.
Suppose that in the long-term, BTC = $100,000 and Joe blow wants to order a $5 cheeseburger in BTC. Here's a few different scenarios:
A. "That'll be 0.00005 BTC please."
B. "That'll be 0.05 mBTC please."
C. "That'll be 50 uBTC please."
D. "That'll be 50 bits please."
A and B are eliminated right off the bat because nobody wants to recall how many zeroes they've put after the decimal.
This leaves us with reasonable C and D, but the word "bit" is far more marketable than "micro-BTC". Micro-BTC just doesn't roll off the tongue like bits does.
I'm good at math too, but that's not the point. It's not about us... we get it, we're fine. We're already invested into BTC. Get over yourself. It's about widespread adoption transcending mathematical literacy, and "bit" is the ideal solution concerning avoiding decimals as well as ownership psychology.

We don't hate Mark Williams for making bad predictions, nor do we hate him for knowing jack shit about bitcoins. 
We hate him because he has used his position of authority and gone out of his way to denounce something he knows nothing about with half-truths and outright lies. From BitcoinMagazine:
"*To assume currency can be computer generated, run in a decentralized manner and outside of the central banking system and controls is farcical and economically dangerous.*"
More of his lies here:

It means those coins bought by SecondMarket will likely not be dumped on the exchange.

"...but you cannot blame GHash.IO for being the  mining pool."
"...but you cannot blame Rockefeller for being the  oil refiner."
"...but you cannot blame Comcast for being the  ISP."
See where this is going?

SecondMarket is a bitcoin broker/dealer. Dumping bitcoins on the market would devalue their assets and drive clients away.

We are talking about future proofing so let's make 1 BTC = $100,000 for easy math.
Suppose Joe blow wants to order a $5 cheeseburger in BTC. Here's a few different scenarios:
~~**A.** "That'll be 0.00005 BTC please."~~
~~**B.** "That'll be 0.05 mBTC please."~~
**C.** "That'll be 50 uBTC please."
**D.** "That'll be 50 bits please."
A and B are eliminated right off the bat because nobody wants to recall how many zeroes they've put after the decimal.
This leaves us with reasonable C and D, but the word "bit" is far more marketable than "micro-BTC". Micro-BTC just doesn't roll off the tongue like bits does.
For those who say we have MicroBitcoin already, it's not about us... we get it, we're fine. We're already invested into BTC. Get over yourself. It's about widespread adoption transcending mathematical literacy, and "bit" is the ideal solution concerning avoiding decimals as well as ownership psychology.

GHash is now back to 41%. What the fuck people &gt;:(

Consumers currently have less incentive than merchants to acquire and use bitcoins because of lack of avenues to acquire BTC as well as non-trivial fees from acquiring them. It's true. 
However, that's just a short term problem... imagine a world where you're able to walk down the streets to any shop and ATM, and exchange bitcoins effortlessly.
Once payment processors figure out the savings from not jumping through credit card hoops, they will pass the savings to consumers as incentives.
