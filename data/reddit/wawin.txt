Right, and at the top to the right you can see the Bitcoin Dominance over Marketcap. Which is at 80%.
@_date: 2016-08-19 18:48:26
Oh I get alright. I don't think you do. He pointed out LTC as a joke because even on its deathbed it still has a higher market cap and actual utility than almost all the other coins in that list. It's usage is almost inexistant yet it still shows up high on the list.  You can find other less legit coins like ripple and steem there too. 
Coins come and go. That's why I pointed out the Bitcoin Dominance index. It's been up and down since the first alt coins were created. People always point out how this new altcoin will for sure take over crypto. At a time it looked like Litecoin could actually do it. In fact back in 2014 some were convinced and  the Bitcoin Dominance index dropped to 77% give or take. That was also the last time the altcoin market had a big rise in number of new coins. You had your blackcoin, drk (now dash), and a whole bunch of other coins pump and dump.  Months later Bitcoin went back to +90% dominance over the market place.
It's now at 80 but it got to 74% when eth pumped some months ago. So whenever we hear that Bitcoin is dying because other alts are eating their lunch we simply point to how we have heard it all before and how the overall dominance of Bitcoin is still the status quo.

@_date: 2015-12-01 13:57:12
There's an entire can of worms that opens with that question.  The answer is fees but with big blocks you need a speculative rise in price so that the fees compensate for the lack of btc reward and with smaller blocks you don't really need a rise in price but you need higher fees to compensate.

I don't understand your argument.  You say that miners don't matter because the "economic majority" will push to BIP101. But you forget Bip101 doesn't do anything until 75 % of miners switch to it. If they don't switch then it doesn't matter if they aren't running BIP101, nodes will validate them anyways because the actual blocksize limit will not be lifted.

I love my xapo card.  For me it's main advantage is that I can convert instantly to fiat if needed. I know I will be asked if I don't mind paying a premium for selling btc but you gotta understand  that  here in Panamá the way to exchange fiat to btc and back is usually summarized in: "call this dude, deposit money on his bank account, wait for him to send me btc at a big fee". 
Before you say localbitcoin, here all the localbitcoin options are dudes that don't live in Panama that are willing to send you btc or fiat but I have to use western union or money gram to interact with them and that is absurdly expensive. 
I used Circle a couple of months ago and it was working brilliantly but Panama recently got put in the big bad list of dangerous countries to do financial transactions with so Circle basically suspended my account over night.  Which left me with a monthly btc income entering my wallet but no easy way to convert any if I wanted.

That's the thing I wonder myself. It would have to simply moon first by the amount it has inside but if that happens wouldn't people that don't want btc also by that point totally think btc is legit even if they themselves don't have any? That would lead me to think that then it would also be valuable to big time collectors that want rare things.

@_date: 2015-12-18 04:11:42
I disagree. People like to say Satoshi said this and that regarding BlockSize but conveniently gloss over how among his final comments he would say how he didn't like zero confirmation being used as valid transactions. He equated zero conf transactions as "second class citizens".   But people go on and on about how is the zeroconf baby killer.
Let's paste it here: source: 
And I quote: " As you figured out, the root problem is we shouldn't be counting or spending transactions until they have at least 1 confirmation.  0/unconfirmed transactions are very much second class citizens.  At most, they are advice that something has been received, but counting them as balance or spending them is premature." -Satoshi
Now waiting for at least 1 confirmation and not liking zeroconf transactions sounds an awful lot like something that would contradict the "instant" quality of his peer 2 peer cash system.  The white paper was the beginning but things were implemented and realities sink in, after a lot of work and collaboration between him and many others it was possible for Bitcoin to advance. The whitepaper isn't the bible, not even Satoshi held it in such a religious regard as people hold it here. 
Edit: The Point being that the old "Satoshi wanted it this way" argument is dishonest.  He showed willingness to discuss and adapt to new evidence that might contradict words he might have said before, holding him and the project hostage to the very first publication he made does not help out and is not constructive to advancement.

I'll bite. I have monthly income coming in via Bitcoin but like 3 places in Panama actually accept bitcoins so if I want to turn some of that to fiat locally then I need to go through a bunch of hoops to do so.
No Coinbase, Kraken or Circle here. So maybe look for someone local right ? Ha! Nope!
Almost no one buys/sells bitcoin in Panama so I'm shit out of luck. At the most I can message this one dude that can help me out but he charges an  arm and a leg for it.
Mycelium local trader? lol I'm the only one there, Localbitcoins? No one there, just dudes from another country that only take Western Union or Moneygram so that's out of the question. 
With Xapo I can get a little fiat from my btc. 
BTW this doesn't mean I convert all my btc; almost all my btc is saved and I'm growing my stash but every now and then I need a little fiat for convenience.

Well the reason for saying it has nothing to do with scaling directly  is that 2x the current amount of transactions is a very low number.  Putting it into context, VISA right now does 2000 transactions per second and Paypal can do 115 per second.  Bitcoin at current settings can do 7 transactions per second.  Say you duplicate it and stay at 2 MB, you get to 14 transactions per second. So you need to do huge blocks to even compete with ONLY Paypal's transactional volume.
For it to be the global currency it needs solutions that are way beyond just upping the blocksize.

It would also be an extremely safe way to slowly grow a bitcoin stash to a larger size via lots and lots of small fees. So there's opportunity to that. Wouldn't be surprised if hodlers opened up nodes just to grow their stash.

Too many people bought coins after watching too many Andreas Antanoupolous videos telling them the blockchain could do everything.  Things exist in a material world and there are tradeoffs. You can't have a descentralized censorship resistant currency and ever growing database of every transaction everybody wants to put in it AND make it almost free to transact too.  There are real life limits to what Bitcoin can do at this level.

BIP101 has nothing to do with directly  scaling Bitcoin. It's main purpose as stated in Gavin's blog posts and in the Github submission is to diminish negative effects that the current limit can create on major adoption.  Gavin explained it as a "kick the can down the road" measure to buy time to solutions that can scale Bitcoin to truly global transaction levels. 
With this comment I am not saying that BIP101 is bad or wrong I'm just trying to clarify a point that many people seem to have forgotten that Bitcoin cannot scale simply by raising the blocksize.

Literally today a couple of blocks were mined and they didn't include any transactions within them.  They just mined the block reward for their own gain and said fuck it to those that wanted to send transactions.

If I understand correctl, the way bitcoin works is that if blocks are starting to be solved too fast then the difficulty in mining them  automatically goes up so that the rate of bitcoins released to the world remains slow. So you answer that by getting bigger machines which in turn makes the difficulty adapt to make it harder so you get another machine... and so it goes

I want to understand something at the conceptual scale of the protocol.
If the bitcoin protocol (ledger) solves the double spend problem. It makes it impossible for others to copy the money because the ledger assures everyone that the money stopped existing in one wallet and moved to the next. Couldn't the same principal be applied to the sending of other digital information, like sending books for example? I send you a  "bit book" and you can resell it or lend it without fear of copyright to the original property because the book has been confirmed by the ledger to be sent to another owner? 
What if kindles operated like that? This bitkindle would let me read a book and after I finish the book I can then sell it to someone. The ledger confirms that it is no longer in my device and as such I haven't committed copyright infringement.  
Not a programmer, so I might be completely off.

Black Markets in over controlled countries need to pay for heavy overhead due to the risky operation they run.  This means that if the price for a product in the normal market = X.  The same product might cost 2 or 3X at the black market.  People still buy it because they need those products that they can't access on the regular market.
If those things are worth 3 times as much and a big enough amount of people are using the black market then you have effectively created a severe inflation problem because the purchasing power for the average user has collapsed and they have to pay more to get the same.
But people aren't going to magically earn more money so they save what they have and don't spend on other non essentials in order to be able to pay for the black market essential goods. This now further hurts the rest of the local  economy because now fewer people are spending on things like restaurants, trips, consumer stuff. 
So the government doesn't like that but instead of freeing up the stores so that everybody can get stuff for cheaper prices, they decide to go after the black markets, which makes them even more expensive.  
The particular case in Venezuela goes even deeper because they have also capped the amount of money you can have in dollars and the amount of money you can take out of the country so that poorer people can't leave ever. So that now creates a black market for dollars. Now you have people that are changing the worthless local currency so that they can use another currency. This further hurts the power of the local currency because it is seen as crap. Government gets pissed at that too so they try to hurt dollar holders as best they can.

I see great value in alt coins.  But mostly because it is a huge experiment lab of digital coin features.   The Bitcoin Protocol as it stands today can't really change immediately nor can it accept huge changes without creating hard forks. 
Choosing which changes to apply is risky and complicated.  A bad fork could seriously hurt bitcoin so any sort of funky experimentation is not possible. 
Alt coins can create lots of features and experiment with funky or even stupid ideas. Those useful ideas that might survive would be copied by other coins and so on. It's like a giant evolutionary battle. Sure it's filled with scam coins,shit coins and pump and dumps but all of that is done away from the main bitcoin protocol. This means that if any super feature is implement and people love it, then bitcoin can eventually adopt said feature.

Ok Guys, we all love open source, especially with regarding anything that touches our bitcoins. The difficult part for sure is turning a profit when having so much of your work open for other people to copy.
That's why open source initiatives around a business also requires stuff like active forums. At the moment, the satoshilabs site says if you want to contribute you can send an email, but that's not enough. What you want is community constantly giving you info, ideas, heck even coding.  That way a lot of your efforts and engineering costs drop because people are voluntarily putting their work up.  What you guys need is to actively lead forum discussions about your trezor right within the satoshilabs site, imagine lots of people doing projects ON TOP of your trezor.
There are lots of tinkerers and makers within the bitcoin community, by enabling them to imagine new stuff to be built on top or along your trezor you can ensure that they themselves buy more and more trezors.

Sigh. Opened your fist two links and it was just info on Rotary Club in Panamá.  Which shows them operating here for decades, also a few talks on their world wide efforts. The others are videos of Rotary Club in Panama City Florida (hint: One is a Country the other is an American City).
Polio was eradicated from Panamá in 1972. And since then all children are vaccinated against it. No cases of chikungunya though in all that time until now.  Also, the original link that started this discussion shows a guided visit that the local government gave to Bill Gates so that they could see a local health and education program for communities in hard to reach areas of the country, in said link they say they will donate 3 million bucks.  
So in all of that you have failed to prove the connection of Bill and Melinda Gates vaccination program in Panamá. You have failed to connect the rise of  Chingunkinya in a country that has been routinely vaccinating against polio since the 50s (even after Polio was controlled and eradicated), and you have failed to read any of the links you yourself have posted.
On top of that you can't seem to stop throwing out insults. Good luck and good day.

I agree. The machines will be liquidated but I'm thinking in all likelihood the sold off miners won't be bought by big companies. I think they will be bought on the cheap by people who live close to these mining farms and the unsold will just go to the trash.

The problem you have explaining bitcoin to people is that you try to explain technical aspects of bitcoin to people when it's not needed.
Say you needed to explain email to someone who has never used it. Would you start talking about how Originally a text-only (ASCII) communications medium, Internet email was extended to carry, e.g. text in other character sets, multi-media content attachments, a process standardized in RFC 2045 through 2049? (copied from wikipedia).  
Of course not, because the technicalities are unnecesary for the average person.  You would explain email as a way to send messages from one device to another using the internet.  
Likewise, bitcoin doesn't need grand technical explanations.  Just talk about how it is programable money, how it is out of government control, how it is world wide, etc. Money for the age of the internet and all that jazz.

From the top of my head, Coinbase could be coin-agnostic, meaning it might not operate solely on bitcoin in the future. As such, it could issue payments in Bitcoin while managing loans or other financial products  in a system that uses Ethereum, Counterparty, Ripple or whichever becomes popular to work with in the future.  Payouts could then be converted and paid back to the user in Bitcoin if he or she wanted it.  
Remember Coinbase isn't Bitcoin, it just works on top of it.

My concern isn't with LN because it's being developed to work on top so I guess they'll just adjust. My nervousness stems from there being way more devs that have and do contribute to the core code than the 6 more vocal ones that one sees on reddit.

Here's the deal dude, you just stumbled into the classic thought that enters the mind of most people that get btc for the first time: "I need Moar."
This means there is a great demand of people looking for this end result.  Which means there are many people out there ready to offer you the possibility of supposedly making you more money and will use that frame of mind to your disadvantage.  Make no mistake,  your skepticism might likely not work correctly while it's feeling greedy. 
If you couple people ready to believe that they'll be rich quick, pseudonymity, no borders and greed,  you have the perfect breeding ground for scammers.
There are those that scam via crowdfunding,   those that might try to tell you to buy into their alt coin, those that will present weird crypto projects to you ( oh my god how lucky are you to be at the ground floor for this revolutionary business!). And last but certainly not least, ponzi schemes that are usually disguised as cloud mining contracts.
Beware dude. Best to do is HODL on to your small stash and do work that can pay on btc or maybe buy a little bit whenever you feel comfortable.

Add more miners depending on how much capital you need to take out.

@_date: 2016-11-16 17:09:56
I appreciate his work, but he would constantly undermine or handwave away any arguments that asked how adverserial actors would behave under his proposals.  Usually he would say something along the lines of "I don't think miners would do something like that, they would only hurt themselves in the process" while other devs would try to argue that you can't expect people to be kittens and angels, especially considering you are working with people's money or identity.
The CW incident highlighted how he tries to see people in a positive light almost to a fault, not thinking adversarialy got him into a mess. I'm sorry to see it hurt him that much but really we all have to stop thinking that considering the behavior of bad actors means you are just being a negative troll.

@_date: 2015-08-17 23:43:45
I think what they are getting at is that spv wallets shouldn't exist at all. This would be internally consistent with the logic of viewing Bitcoin protocol as layer 0 and having clients running on the lighting network as layer 1.   Not sure I agree with full out eliminating spv wallets but I understand their argument if the point is to have layer 0 as secure as possible.
Someone more knowledgeable than myself please correct me if I misunderstood .

If you read the gavin blog posts he made before XT was released he clearly says many times that 8mb block aren't a panacea but it buys the network time while the other solutions are actually built. As it stands it was estimated that we would start hitting the 1mb limit constantly next year or if a bubble/hype news cycle hits bitcoin world. 
This has been said many times and all the small block proponents know that it has been repeated and repeated yet they bring back this point like no one has thought about it, it is dishonest and a clear distraction tactic.

Thank you for this. Detailed paced explanations like this one are the sort of stuff that are changing my mind from the XT fork to maybe a more conservative fork solution. The maturement of the fee market is sounding to me like a better option even if it collapses the price on the short term. The thing that I have to ask myself, if transaction fees then move as high as is pointed in your analysis, would people actually WANT to use bitcoin  ?  I'm sure I'm missing something here though.

Your argument isn't so different from Lightning Network implementation, basically stuff that happens on layer 1.  The discussion isn't about that, it's about how both extremes of the discussion are the ones holding the power and they both have their points.
Team Big Blocks think the time is close until we hit the block limit all the time, bringing with it processing delays and people abandoning the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Team Small Blocks says that this is true, but that's a good thing. They want Bitcoin to hit the 1mb block limit because according to them this will incentivize a fee market and solutions like Lightining Network or the extension blocks would make sense with said fees existing. (Say the extension blocks for example happen, who mines the mega blocks if the rest of the network is at 1mb? solution: paid with big big big fees).
This opposing views are fundamentally different because it's a dissagreement about what Bitcoin IS.  
All the arguments make sense on both camps if you view their internal logic.  Big Blockers want Bitcoin to be electronic cash within the fundamental rules of the protocol, that means that it needs to among other things never stop gaining popularity, so block limit hinders popularity. Limited popularity hinders usability and as such limits people's ability to use btc on a day to day basis.
Team Small Block view Bitcoin as Layer 0, as such it needs to be air tight super secure and as efficient as possible so other things can work on top of it. Since it needs to be so secure then it makes no sense within this scenario to do anything that would hinder it's functionability, making blocks bigger is an unknown so they view this change as a threat.
Thing is, the XT proposal is of course a logical conclusion of what happens when one of the groups views the 1mb cap nearing in daily usage as a fundamental threat to what Bitcoin is, so they rush to bring something out.  This action in itself is ofcourse viewed as a fundamental threat to Bitcoin by the small blockers, because it isn't exactly known *what* will happen with this change.  To this you add that both sides have power. Team Big Block has great popular power because amongst other things they have been very very good at explaining their points of view, Team Small Block has great power because they are a majority amongst the Bitcoin Core devs so they can simply refuse to do the changes.
We are very much stuck between a Game Theory Scenario. Both camps believe to the fullest that they are correct in their actions, so much so that they have resorted to dishonesty, innacuracies and flat out name calling.  So yeah, extension blocks, sidechains, etc, all of those are interesting but are besides the point that small blockers and big blockers hold all the power and they will exert their power now and again if another big issue that affects the fundamental reality of what Bitcoin is comes up.

I had a similar journey. My hate for knew no bounds, I was all about them Big Blocks. I started to turn back when I heard the Gavin v PeterTodd interview on Let's Talk Bitcoin last year and from there I saw the hall of fame thread on bitcointalk by Peter: [" How a floating blocksize limit inevitably leads towards centralization" ](  in which many core devs from then and now back in Feb 2013 were arguing on the topic.  The thread is rather long but it's worth a read. After reading that I dived deeper into the rabit hole and opted to re-read stuff from core devs that I had read before with an angry head and tried to see the logic behind it all and it started to click.  
I'm amazed at how much of a beating those guys take while trying to keep moving forward. Latest Core Build is a testament to their hard work.

I think two of the things that helped out here on were things like:
* Showing redditor age. I know some like to make new accounts every couple of months for privacy reasons, and I respect that; but there are many sockpuppets that are furiously active for about a 2 weeks and then quietly fade into the night.  Never to come back again.  The age has helped at least me to think twice if what I'm reading is something that comes from someone that is sincere or just parroting. That said, it does nothing to counter bought accounts; not sure what could be even done about that.
* Showing downvoted comments to counter the vote brigading.  Seems clear that the prefered method to manipulate discussion in the method shown in the video is making sure certain user's comments dissappear under downvotes.
Reddit itself just recently rolled out supposedly some changes to the upvote/downvote algo for threads, I wonder if it'll help.

I wouldn't say disingenuous, it's very possible that there was a real misunderstanding and I'd rather assume this is the case instead of thinking they were being intentionally misleading.  
I've heard before that the business culture in China has some specific differences which sometimes makes westerners confused. One of them is how they sometimes won't give you a straight NO because it is considered rude depending on the context.   I imagine maybe something like that happened and Classic folks thought they were getting a 'yes' when they were just being humored and they didn't consider the cultural difference.

Usage of open communication channels exists not only for the sake of transparency but also to protect people from acussations of ill intent. From reading the latest Purse blog it seems they overtly went out of their way to not talk to any dev either BU or Core, this has left them terribly exposed.

It's funny cause bitfinex is currently at one of it's most shorted moments ever. 
Go to  and click all.
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:12:04
It's bullish if the fees to go short start getting expensive and the price stays sideways. If shorts are actually in profit, they don't care to pay  fees to maintain their position but if they pile up and the btc supply from which they borrow from starts drying up WHILE the price doesn't dip enough, then they start to lose money everyday just to stay in position. If it gets too expensive they close (and are forced to buy), which puts other shorts deeper in the red so they close too and so on...
The spike:  people were attempting to game Bitfinex's terms of bcash distribution.

Bcash fork.   
People read the terms of Bitfinex on how they would distribute bcash and found a little loophole. Long story short, basically even low leverage short called hedges would get more bcash than normal btc holders  so people en masse started "hedging" their btc to get more bcash. Finex saw through it and they were not awarded the extra coin. After the fork concluded and Bitcoin was declared not dead, again, people went on with their business.

I would take it a step further. Say the site doesn't wanna complicate things and they let the blockchain.info LN compatible API handle it (for this thought experiment I'm assuming bc.i continue their experimentation with LN ). User opens up a channel that is valid across all sites that use  blockchain.info API. So I'm not really locking into just the gambling site, I'm locking into the entire blockchain.info api network which is pretty big.

As I understand it Gavin's test haven't been done at a wide scale. Right now I would venture to say that stuff like what happened last week when the blocks were being bombarded due to the price rally gives the devs great insight into what exactly does happen when the limit is hit. How do miners react?  How do the fees change? Are people trying to double spend ? How many are being successful?  
All of these are unknowns unless the limit is hit. What if a big security problem does arise right now with the current blocksize?   Well the devs would have pretty good real world information about how the network reacts and be able to fix accordingly with the next fork, but what if we never test the limits of the blocksize and we do a hard fork for bigger blocks only to encounter said unforeseen failure in the future with a bigger more expensive and heavier network; you would have to hardfork again! One hard fork is hard enough picture having to do another one.

Discussion thread about this post:   
@_date: 2016-10-30 20:34:36
Here's the opinion of the first adopter and miner beside's Satoshi, Hal Finney :
"Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.
Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.
George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.
I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the "high-powered money" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today."

That's great cause the lightning network development team is completely separate from the other projects. I think what you are trying to say is that you fear that there might be a conflict of time and effort if some devs have side projects besides bitcoin core? Would that be an accurate reading?
@_date: 2015-11-12 02:34:13
Bitcoin scalability is not based on the blockchain limit being loosened; even Gavin said that on his blog post about raising the limit "not being a panacea". These projects are what will make Bitcoin usable precisely because they are not changes to the protocol itself. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 02:17:20
I've read that quote. But how does that mean that lightning network is a competing interest? It's a whole different layer that works on top of Bitcoin. Are you implying other stuff shouldn't be developed ?
Edit: gonna add some cause your comment now has more info.
Do you believe it is impossible for development of other offchain/sidechain solutions to exist that could help Bitcoin scale? If you do I would like to understand your reasoning because Bitcoin itself cannot scale mearly by raising the block limit; this is something that has been said by proponents of both sides of the block debate. Gavin himself has said that he wants to raise the limit to give time for real scalability solutions LIKE  the lightning network.

You know how everybody always talks about how things will be built on top of Bitcoin and people won't know they are using it? They are refering to this idea that Bitcoin is primarily a network and the information it moves can be used for many different things that possibly we haven't imagined yet.
People like to use the early Internet example for Bitcoin so let's go with that. Now, when stuff like TCP/IP was invented they never envisioned someone would use it to send memes about how their football team just clobbered another one. They were just concentrated on making sure the basic foundation was always working.  The protocol let's others play on top without you needing to explicitly detail every single thing that they can and can't do, some general rules exist and certain stability is established and people can go wild and design all sorts of stuff.
What would happen though if tomorrow someone wanted to do a basic change of how one of these protocols operated, well if it's sudden some stuff might not work at all. Changes at this level are very sensitive since so many people start building on top.  Once you consider how important it is for those that are building on top of you for the protocol to be stable and secure then you start thinking about just what exactly are the things that can go wrong which would break the services that people can build on top of it. What's cumbersome? What's adding fat to it? How can it be attacked ? 
The devs are doing that,  building the first layers of something  that most of us can't really imagine how far it can go.  Now since Bitcoin to top it off is not just any invention, but a fundamentally subversive concept, things that were already normal considerations like stability and safety now become paramount because not only normal people will try to break it, people more powerful might try to. Hell, one of the reasons people like is so valuable even if many hate him is because he has the uncanny ability to be able to think like an attacker.  Let's keep in mind that this is something that transmits value and can affect people's well being if you use it in certain ways.
Many other things can come to one's mind once you consider that it's not the first layer's priority or objective to provide many concrete features or services, the priority is stability and security; it needs to "always work".   So if you already are thinking about how you can protect the protocol then it's only natural that whenever someone wants to change it then feathers will be ruffled. The blocksize debate got heated partly because of this, the blockchain is the heart of Bitcoin and changing it is not as easy as flipping a switch.  Again this is where it always gets tough with Bitcoin. The whole system works based on utilizing a miner's greed so that they secure the network. So any change has to also consider Game Theory. If things aren't carefully calibrated then those who secure our network can either leave or do attacks themselves.
Thing is, this fundamentally goes against what the white paper originally envisioned for Bitcoin.  A worldwide electronic cash for everyone. It can't possibly be so and at the same time be a value protocol. This is a fundamental schism in thought. So the question we aren't asking enough is, what is Bitcoin anyways?

Basically the idea is that if a company becomes the leader in providing devolpment they will consequently become the go to place should you need to apply similar or custom solutions based on this tech.

If some miners leave because they don't like how much they are making on transaction fees alone then the hashrate drops which means those miners that don't leave make more money. Since the blockreward halvings aren't a secret and they will happen spread across many years then this exiting of miners wouldn't happen suddenly so security won't die down.
But you are correct in thinking that currently the block reward is basically subsidizing the miner work and that this "cheap transactions" thing many were sold about Bitcoin isn't exactly true.  Naturally this means that larger fees are needed on the long term for Bitcoin to survive.  This goes aligned with what Lightning Network wants to do, make massive amount of transactions happen within the payment channels and only big transactions with big fees are sent to the actual blockchain. 
This doesn't sound like the death of Bitcoin to me, quite the contrary. But it does sound like an inevitable discussion which the community isn't doing about just "What is Bitcoin?".  Settlement Network or Internet Cash?

After Vladislav Zhirkov's strategy of 'Managed Democracy' took hold in Russia, I would say that most political movements in Russia are backed by Putin in one way or another even if Zhirkov himself is no longer part of the government.
They basically fund anything, this creates confusion as nobody knows the official stance of Russia in many policy issues. It also undermines any political opposition because then others can point at you and go "don't listen to him, he is sponsored by the government!".

These irc meetings for noobs and nontechies posts have really helped me to understand lots of things that used to go way over my head before.  Thanks. 
I know stuff is still heated but one thing that I've noticed while reading these posts is just how committed the core devs are to making sure the protocol is above all things safe from an attack that could fundamentally undermine Bitcoin. 
While I don't agree with many of the mod actions that have transpired over the past couple of months, reading posts like this one and stuff that has posted over on bitcointalk have turned me from big blocker to block conservative.

Indeed a HF was not needed inmediately due to SW, however popular demand for a HF has basically pushed everybody's hand towards making a HF regardless. This includes miners who were pretty adamant towards wanting a HF increase of the blocksize + SW and other optimizations.  
Now, since evidence of HF coding was pushed as a requirement to adopt SW by many miners then Core is going to do it and add things included in the Hard Fork wishlist.  Said code will be released on July of 2016.  This is not news.

I don't think you have been keeping up with events. When the [HK agreement]( was made some miners said they would adopt SegWit after they see code for the 2017 Hard Fork.
SegWit itself was proposed to be shown as code on April, [and it was]( Now it's finalizing testing across different miners, wallets and companies but for the SoftFork to actually be activated beyond it's 95% threshold Core has to show code for the 2017 Hard Fork.
And to code the 2017 HardFork you pretty much have to have a wishlist of things to add to it, [which exists.](    
That said, some things might be added or not to the list, so some things are being discussed. Where to read them? You can read the mailing list, keep up on the core slack or read the open IRC discussions that happen daily.
Really, at this point there is so much information on so many places regarding the advancements that I am shocked to see somebody say that nothing is being done. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 19:54:16
These meetings usually talk about a bunch of issues that Bitcoin faces right now some of which affect the security of the network right now. 
The core devs view the security of Bitcoin as the top priority because if this is broken then it's essentially worthless. 
When I refer to the block size I am indeed changing tangentially the subject since it wasn't mentioned in the meeting. I am pointing it out because one of the things that could facilitate serious problems to the security of the network is the rising of the blocksize and how this change is made.  
I hear what you are trying to say because it is very scary to think of Bitcoin as something that could stagnate and die due to the block size being hit but the more I read into all the problems Bitcoin currently has which could be exacerbated with a hard fork that raises the blocksize the more I tend to agree with the notion that hitting the blocksize limit right now is better than accidentally hurting the protocol beyond any sort of repair. In fact I used to agree that the blocksize was a no brainer and it should go up and it should go up right now. 
While I am not a fan of the "appeals to authority" I am however a professional who deals with engineers and clients all the time. My work basically puts me sometimes in the middle of both.  A client might get flustered because he needs a big space without columns but the engineer will point out how the option is unfeasible.  It's not that the engineer wants the building to fail, is that he sees a major weakness in the proposal.  Similarly in this current case I am more inclined to trust the experts on this one.

You can also pay attention to the lending rates at poloniex. During big events the fee can skyrocket out of nowhere due to low liquidity of btc available for margin trading. There's a telegram group where a bot warns you when fees have shot up, I'm talking sudden bursts to 1% a day, right now it's like at 0.003% though. The group is this one, no talking allowed in it. BTC Lending Spikes
Warning: best way to use it is to have some btc in poloniex ready to go but that puts your money at risk since it now stays in that exchange and are exposed to counterparty risk .
@_date: 2016-07-02 14:40:08
The fees in Satoshi vs fees in dollars graph  brings an interesting point IMO. Given a scenario in which fees wouldn't rise in Satoshi for x or y reasons, a rise in value of BTC against the dollar would inevitably push "smallish value" transactions off the network.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:00:56
Thanks for the rundown. So basically we could get segwit and then just ignore the segwit2x client altogether and abandon the hardfork?

ELI5. Say you bought 1 btc on localbitcoins, then another 1 on coinbase. Both on different addresses. Coinbase (and other prying eyes) has no way of knowing that you own 2 bitcoins. Local bitcoin guy sees you got 1 btc and coinbase sees you got 1 btc. 
However if you were to buy the 2 btc on the same address now coinbase knows that you used what looks like local bitcoins to their blockchain analysis. Each time you reuse an address you are giving away bits and pieces of your info if you aren't carefull. Some might not care, but for some this can make for a massive difference.

Keep in mind that Bitcoin is a protocol, not a specific program or technology. 
Kind of how the Internet is in its essence an information transfer protocol, yet you see millions of different programs all taking part in the transfer of information. Be it iTunes for music, youtube for videos, Xbox live for gaming; you name it, someone has adapted it. 
Remember the Internet when it started? It was quite a technical affair.  Nowadays grannies use ipads.  People will eventually make more and simpler ways of taking advantage of the Bitcoin protocol.

This is the basis for the Consumer Culture.  Inflationary Economies create ridiculous growth but for it to function it needs consumers which in turn creates an incentive to create disposable stuff.  The entire planet can't live in a consumer culture.  Greens have been fighting for years to curb the consumer culture but it will always  be a losing battle as long as the basis for the finances of the world is the Consumption of Cheap Stuff. Stuff like the banking crash, housing  bubbles, construction of worthless infrastructure, ghost cities, they are all a product of Countries realizing that the current game is rigged, either you spend or you fall so they create or incentivize false demand.

Keep in mind that he is talking about slow deflation, not rampant wild deflation.  A slow deflation shouldn't be any more dangerous than slow inflation. The difference is that a slow deflation should incentivize the production of longer lasting products since buyers would only want products that actually last (or if the new product is clearly better than the last).
