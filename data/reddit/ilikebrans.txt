Thanks, more people need to read stuff like that. But I disagree with your last two lines. Bitcoin, with RBF and feefull blocks, seems to be first establishing itself as a settlement system, and later establishing itself as a currency. A year or two from now, with LN out and about, things might be different. But after reading the scaling solution, I'm beginning to agree with a lot of what the core devs have been saying for a while -- bitcoin works best with an underlying, albeit expensive, settlement layer.

I guess, but these aren't all-purpose chips. They're chips specifically designed for bitcoin mining.
I clarify this because I was first told that bitcoin was a driving force behind a technological arms race. It was said that bitcoin motivated breakthroughs in computing that could trickle down to research, gaming, etc. But with everyone using ASICs (the bitcoin-mining-specific chips), this isn't really the case.

Dash has 200x smaller marketcap than bitcoin, so of course it's more vulnerable now. You're also ignoring the cost of maintaining each node (electricity, bandwidth, data storage). Dash also has instantly confirmed transactions and increased anonymity over bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-12-17 16:36:25
Yea so bitcoin, in this decade, is clearly not going to be a payment network. This is because of bandwith and storage limitations. As it stands, it makes more sense for bitcoin to develop as a settlement network first. You can clearly see the devs focusing on hammering this out first. 
As the price of bitcoin rises and technology catches up with our dreams, bitcoin can almost certainly become a payment network.

@_date: 2015-12-22 05:26:44
I am kind of drunk, so I guess now is a good time to try. 
Bitcoin is proof-of-work. Some altcoins like peercoin are proof-of-stake.
In proof-of-work, a miner "mines" a block by guessing numbers over and over. This takes a lot of energy, but it's considered very secure. To take over the network you would need an absurd number of computers. "Work" = computing power
In proof-of-stake, there is no guessing of numbers. Instead, the more coins you have in your wallet, the more likely you are to "mine" a block. Mining blocks doesn't require a powerful computer, all it requires is you winning the lottery. That's right, PoS relies on a random number generator to reward its users, just like the lottery. "Stake" = number of coins (think like bankrobbers each taking a stake from the loot)
People don't like PoS because 1) generating truly random numbers is difficult 2) It favors a "rich get richer" scenario 3) It doesn't require an expendable reseource, which may make it insecure. Note that I said "may". The people who believe  are probably being cautious. These altcoins don't have the market cap bitcoin does, so they haven't really been attacked. Most security researchers will tell you that systems are always secure until they're not (lol). For them it's more of a qualitative, gut-feeling reason behind ignoring PoS, though I can't say I disagree with it. Interestingly, the lack of mining power which may be a security flaw as mentioned in  is also what makes PoS so attractive -- no expendable resources also means it's better for the environment!
Anyway, a private-blockchain company could create a blockchain and distribute coins between a number of individuals. Then an RNG could be used to keep rewarding them coins, while they also mined blocks and shared the database. In order to have an attack on the network, someone would need &gt; 50 % of the total coins in circulation -- namely, instead of hacking 1 company, you would need to hack at least half the companies and get the secret keys to their wallets. Also, this blockchain would be set up so that you could only access it within a certain range of IP addresses held by each company. Want to hire me to bulid this for your company? I could, I work for cheap wine and bitcoin

Because i can call my phone if i lose it. I can unlock and swipe/snap with my phone faster than i can type in a debit card pin. And its more secure than a credit card because of security settings.

how do you count numbers in an internet community? the "consensus" you see for bitcoin core may be fabricated by fake accounts, as evidenced by the multitude of year-old Blockstream supporters on the core dev-list. 
the only way to count numbers is to count representable entities with expendable resources -- companies, pools, miners

1) Miners show support for classic by signing blocks with classic version-code
2) After 1 week, we know what % of hashrate is supporting classic vs core
3) After 1 month, classic increases the blocksize
it is in miner's (and everyone's) best interest to mine the longest chain. While what you're saying is possible, i think steps 1, 2, and this last fact are meant to prevent an economic division

As an early-adopter, I was sold on bitcoin as the fuel to a technological arms race. Hardware manufacturers were supposedly motivated to design faster chips (GPUs) in order to mine bitcoin faster. Shortly after I arrived came the ASICs. 
As you probably know (but others might not), ASICs are designed for one purpose only -- bitcoin mining. Whereas GPUs can also be used in research, gaming, and other computationally expensive processes, ASICs are essentially useless outside of bitcoin. 
I think chaning the PoW algorithm would benefit society tremendously. And it would re-decentralize the currency.

Yes, yes, no. In the case of this specific upcoming hardfork, coins will be able to spent on both of the new forks.

? An exchange that allows trading of two currencies makes twice as much on fees.
@_date: 2015-08-27 23:52:51
well, i don't think it goes against the objective of bitcoin, and here's why:
today, miners choose which tx they want in their blocks, and most pools ignore tx with 0 fees. i am pretty sure this is because of two reasons. 1) people are afraid of spam attacks. given that bitcoin is still very young, having a ~$0.10 fee allows for controlled 'stress tests' that are essentially spam attacks. 2) people are lazy. most default wallets stick to the mintxfee of 0.0001btc and minrelayfee 0.0001btc just because that's what everyone else is doing (and the reason in 
once we have a few more stress tests under our belts, (that is, bitcoin is proven antifragile) the min tx fees are going to need to drop relative to legacy currency rates if bitcoin hopes to be useful. And, they're going to have to be dynamically-set in order to ensure bitcoin remains useful even as its legacy value rises. really, the blocksize debate, the fee debate (coming soon), and spam attacks are all interconnected. very soon we will need to alter the protocol to have lower min fees just because of reason  so long as harddrives keep getting bigger and internet gets faster, we will have feeless transactions. probably within about 10 years, don't you think?
edit: i just realized i didn't explain anything. in order to dynamically change fees, a miner can use **their own** criteria for allowing which fees they want, exactly how the protocol works now. the only thing that will change will be the mindset around fees and bitcoin's fragility. nobody is encouraging miners to run feeless nodes today because it could lead to an attack on the network. with more research and time, this mindset will change.

Well, you didn't answer the first time I asked nicely, so I had to invoke Cunnigham's law. I never done any shit like this haha
@_date: 2015-08-27 01:42:30
this will get down-voted, but practically-speaking, if fees were set to a flat rate relative to USD (say a normal tx had roughly a $0.001 fee, based on various exchanges' rates), this would cause a price explosion as bitcoin would be much more useful. It would be more useful because this would be the cheapest way to move money, by far. This would lead to a much higher USD value for block rewards for miners. it would also be a large enough fee to make spamming transactions economically unfeasible. it's a win-win for everyone.
perhaps some combination of CNY, USD, and other major currencies could be averaged to determine the fee. personally, i don't think right now is the best time for this kind of change, because bitcoin still has a lot of room for growth (that is, advanced features) before mass adoption. however, i bet one day a more mature bitcoin or a different digital currency will make use of this facet.

A decent number of people suspect that the "small block" crowd of core devs is only purporting small blocks for financial interest -- namely, there's a strong correlation between small block proponents and employment at Blockstream.
That being said, the same could be suspected of "large block" crowds being employed by large mining operations under the table.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but from a practical standpoint, sidechains and altcoins are nearly identical. 
The biggest difference between sidechains and altcoins is that the first is more likely to cause the price of bitcoin to rise. Yes you can 'merge mine' on bitcoin sidechains, but you can merge-mine other altcoins too.
@_date: 2016-02-08 13:20:05
You didn't counter my point at all tho. 
Having alternative uses for ASICs is critical. People (gamers and researchers) would have more reasons to buy them. You could connect your ASIC to the bitcoin network when you're not using it for your particular use and make a profit / help decentralization.
@_date: 2016-02-07 23:54:24

Good idea. If a government wanted premind coins (to retain control of the currency), a colored coin seems like a good way to do to that. Then you could distribute them to the people, all while having the protective hashing power of bitcoin's proof-of-work.

Blockchain technology isn't exclusive to bitcoin. You seem to understand this since you specify, "you must use bitcoins to use the **bitcoin** blockchain. What if they didn't want to use the bitcoin blockchain?
Banking today takes days to transfer money between institutions. A second blockchain that confirms transactions instantaneously, in a publically-auditable way could easily be what they're talking about. This second blockchain would be privatized so that hashing power can only come from select sources -- namely, the companies that have invested in Chain. It would give an added layer of decentralization to banking practices (it's distributed across multiple companies), while barring security threats by those outside (such as current miners of bitcoin), and would not need to use the bitcoin blockchain. I am not sure this is what they're doing, but if I were a banker, this is what I would envision. 
If you are going to disagree with me please explain why what I posted above isn't possible.

The problem is that merchants are keeping all the money theyre saving from not using credit cards.
If youre a merchant, you save about 3% everytime someone pays in bitcoi vs credit cards. A win win situation would be if merchants offered 1.5% discounts for bitcoin purchases - everyone wins.
Even with 1% fees by coinbase on the buyer end, everyone wins.
Edit: Hey guys my comment is objectively true. The counterarguments after this are strangely aggressive. If you dont believe me please do some of your own research. Thanks.

Chain.so is the shit. It has websockets for exchanges that haven't even made their websockets public.

@_date: 2015-09-10 06:17:54
The data in the blockchain can be made public, but the hashing itself is privatized. It's still publically auditable because people can confirm through the blockchain that no double spends were made.
I am not sure why you would say "You don't understand why it takes that long" and not explain why I'm wrong. I would really like to know if it's relevant, I am not here to argue as much as I am to learn.
Speaking of not understanding, I am pretty sure you went meta when you said "The cognitive dissonance in every blockchain argument is unreal". If there is one side of this argument with cognitive dissonance, it's yours. You either seem to not understand blockchain tech well enough to get my point, or are refusing to accept that bitcoin could fail because of this since you've invested so much money in it already (classic cognitive dissonance). 
Tl;Dr you haven't said anything regarding why Chain must be using the bitcoin blockchain. I am pretty sure my theory is right, please someone with some sense reply to disprove me, I don't want this to be true.

Look, that was true at first, when from the perspective of a single company (Nasdaq) they would not get much out of a blockchain.
But when multiple companies come together, they can potentially each act as a node on a "private" network for proposing and mining blocks. Nodes outside this ring of companies would not have their blocks received by the network. I am not sure exactly how this will work (that's why I haven't received $30m in funding), but tbh, this article could be trouble for bitcoin.

No, it doesn't have to be. Not in this case. That was true when their was one company looking to have a blockchain for their company. It would be possible to have a blockchain that was distributed over a set of companies, where each company held a certain level of trust for verifying transactions.

The amount of time it takes for a bitcoin transaction to confirm depends on its "priority". 
    priority = sum(**input_value** * input_age)/(180*number_of_inputs + 24*number_of_outputs + 10)
That formula might not make any sense at first, but it's pretty easy to grasp what's important here.
First, look at the link you gave. In the transaction, to the left of the green arrow, are the inputs. They all come from the same address ("1NDGx.."). On the right of the arrow, you can see where the money is going. Some of it goes to your bitcoin address ("15T8G...") while any leftovers goes back to 1NDGx. For now, just know you have 7 inputs on the left, and 2 outputs on the right.
So, based on the formula above:
*  The more "number_of_inputs" you have, the lower priority your transaction will be.  (7 is an ~average~ amount). You want a high priority transaction so it gets confirmed quicker.
*  The smaller "input_value" (the amount of bitcoins in each input), the lower priority your transaction will be. (Your input values really aren't that small).
* As the "input_age" increases (that is, your inputs grow older), priority for this transaction will increase as well.
 ** Just glancing at the 4.5 btc input, it still hasn't confirmed from its previous sender.** Since this input_value represents the bulk of your input, you should expect to wait until this transaction has at least one confirmation, 
One more thing: A typical block only allows for %0.6 of it to be feeless transactions. Your ATM operator is a dick, because to save money, they chose to remove miner fees from their outgoing transactions. So, you want to know if your transaction will definitely confirm at some point? I grow a bit fuzzy in my knowledge here, but I'm pretty sure your transaction only won't confirm if it was sent during a stress test or spam attack which isn't happening now... although...  the fact that the 4.5BTC input still hasn't confirmed is worrysome, considering it was sent over 24 hours ago. Keep an eye on that, and any other transactions that haven't confirmed in your inputs (I only checked 2). It is definitely possible to move unconfirmed coins, and yet... 24 hours for that tx is a lot, given its input and output sizes.
edit: there are much better, more succinct explanations by others in this thread

Mike Hearn worked for Google and seems like a down-to-earth guy. At the risk of sounding hyperbolic, I see him having the skill of Linus Torvalds with the mainstream-understanding of Steve Jobs. 
I can't be the only person in this subreddit who feels like some Bitcoin Core developers are a bit too anti-government, a bit too anti-regulation. I like bitcoin's decentralization and future feelessness, but its anonymity is a bit riskier.
I also respect Mike Hearn because he doesn't promote his software, nor does he bash the alternatives. He's one of the founding fathers of the, "Let me code what I think Bitcoin should be. If you want to come along, great, but you don't have a right to stop me."  Even if you're here for bitcoin's anonymity, Mike Hearn's "bitcoin for the masses" might be what the world needs to see the value in a generic digital currency, and transitively, a more private bitcoin.
I think that's the best part of a decentralized protocol. Let people throw out ideas, scan them up and down and around, and finally, see whatever works best for *you*.

Urcomment was the shit!
@_date: 2015-09-02 15:23:24
Earlier you said "mining and verifying nodes will be forced into server farms" so my comment was not irrelevant. TBH, I think BIP100 is a bad plan that gives too much power to miners, and that we should switch to 8MB blocks immediately. I don't see increasing to 8MB as a radical change by any means -- it's 8MB!! We can evaluate further blocksize increases in the future.
I think hardforks are a nice way to act as a 'referendum'. New ideas can be submitted yearly into a hardfork. If miners decide they like the ideas, they can do so by joining the codebase. Otherwise they can stay away. I don't see the advantage to hardforks as a consensus mechanism, but rather as a way to implement new ideas in a  decentralized manner. But that's a different discussion entirely.

Imagine a system of payment where the payment-verifiers were paid through a pre-defined output of newly-generated currency. You could have free, instant, feeless transactions, since the new currency would offset the costs by the payment verifiers. Why is anonymity even needed? The currency would be decentralized among payment verifiers from all over the world, so it isn't *tied* or *controlled* by a government, all it's lacking is anonymity.
Plus I don't mind sacrificing some anonymity to stop people from blowing up my country, or to help my policemen protect me, or to build fucking roads and educate my kids. Yeah government is inefficient, but letting people anonymize their payments won't make government more efficient, it'll crumble it.

e.g. "i am Chris Rico. I own 15 ATMs but would like to own 25. I would like a package with 25 API keys and blah blah blah.". then maybe they would release a series of packages for ATM operators, or work with you directly and come up with a fair price if your demands exceeded their ATM package

The reason BTC-e always has a lower exchange rate is because you can't deposit/withdraw USD from the U.S anymore on BTC-e. 
So right now, you could transfer your bitcoin to BTC-E, then sell them for USD. You wouldn't be able to withdraw your USD though.
You might say, "oh, that's great. Let me do that, then when BTC-e goes back below the other exchanges, I'll buy back even more bitcoin than I had before!". 
Unfortunately, the halting of U.S. withdrawals is often a precursor to exchanges closing up indefintely. I am going to go out on a limb here and predict that BTC-e closes within the next two weeks.

Here is a screenshot of some stats from the 'advanced' section of 
If you want to transfer USD from Rock to SnapSwap, you would lose over 9%. Since Rock's fees for USD withdrawal are gargantuan, most US customers would prefer to withdraw from SnapSwap, which has tiny fees. Thus, a USD on SnapSwap is worth more than a USD on Rock. Even though they are both USD on the 'ripple network'
"Withdraw" in this context is a bank withdraw -- actually receiving the USD for spending outside a trading website. Maybe I should write a blog post on this.

Ripple boasts small fees, but they never mention the very situation you just described. 
For example, $100 in Mercury USD on the Ripple network might only be worth $96 in BitStamp USD on the Ripple network. In other words, moving 'USD' from Mercury to Stamp or any other kind of money transfer can result in a loss of 4%, in addition to ripple fees. It's true that you can make 4% moving from Stamp to Mercury, but if you can't withdraw from Mercury, this doesn't help (many regulated exchanges offer withdrawals in EUR and not USD, resulting in similar price gaps despite being centralized).
The 'promises to pay' you described create an exchange rate gap that results in much, much higher fees for moving money.
