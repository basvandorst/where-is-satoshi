I do know for a fact that Laszlo Hanyecz is in fact not a multi-millionaire.

Note: the left pic is actually from Hungary and Hungarian inflation in 1946 (70 years ago) was worse than the German inflation after WW1

It's all good and I try my best.
Also, not so fun fact: Hungary's inflation in 1946 was so bad that at the height of the inflation, prices were rising at the rate of 150,000% per day. The goverment just didn't even collect taxes by then, because it wasn't worth it.
Another fact: The Forint replaced the Pengő in 1946 at a rate of 400,000 Quadrillion Pengö to 1 Forint

Yes and no, there are a lot of cryptos that only have a dozen or so and are well over 40k$ because of that. But DogeCoin was meant as an easy way to trade cryptos for goods and services, but due to there being millions and millions of DogeCoins, it got nowhere. Bitcoin hit a nice ratio of availability and utility. If another coin could that and get popular enough it could *maybe* compete with BTC

Limited supply, Bitcoin is expensive because it is limited (with a reasonable total amount) and was the first to do it.
