I do not believe all coins are being sold immediately, but probably a larger ratio than when we are in a bull market. 
Since miners have bills to pay that are due monthly, they have no choice but to sell to at least cover those costs. Why hold them when the bear trend is so invincible? I'd maybe hold 20% at the most on the offchance that I could potentially catch a local top.

I don't think you really understood my point.
My point is that market conditions dictate when miners sell. If Bitcoin were in a raging bull market, do you think miners would immediately sell? Hell no. Maybe they sell some percentage, but sell every coin as it's generated? No, they would hold and wait for what they thought the top was and then sell.
Furthermore, after we hit the top, nobody knows if that was actually the top yet. Miners will hold for a while longer thinking that maybe that wasn't the top, just a temporary correction. At some point, they will recognize a bear market and start selling as soon as they are generated.
After a year of near constant downward movement, everybody and their mom recognizes that this is a bear market. Therefore most miners will be immediately selling, fearing that the market will go ever lower.

Without a doubt.

We are of the same mindset mostly. I find your response somewhat puzzling due to this.
Yes, they must now sell, as I have stated previously in my post below.
"Since miners have bills to pay that are due monthly, they have no choice but to sell to at least cover those costs. Why hold them when the bear trend is so invincible? I'd maybe hold 20% at the most on the offchance that I could potentially catch a local top."
If they cannot afford to hold any coins at this moment, which is quite feasible due to the extraordinary difficulty increase, then they will be out of business shortly and the mining difficulty will adjust accordingly.
They should have around 25 days per month in which to decide when to sell. If their margins increase enough, due to say, a bull market - then they do not have to sell everything they generate. They have the luxury of being able to hold more Bitcoin if they so choose, which they would no doubt exercise in a bull market. It would be the rational course of action.

Cryptographically secure, unlike.... anything.

Yeah, fuck private money that can be sent across the globe instantly, that is the most secure form of money in history! What a fucking scam!
If there is anything I'm confident in, it's Bitcoin.

I'm guaranteeing the Sun doesn't rise tomorrow.
Seriously, I'm guaranteeing it.

I disagree that anything changed.
Regardless of how many miners come on board, ~3600 coins are always going to be produced. The only thing that has changed is that we are in a bear market which further exacerbates downward momentum. Instead of mining, holding as the price increases, and selling at a higher price, miners are most likely selling as soon as possible because the bear trend has been intact all year.
If we were all still using GPUs for mining we would still have to absorb 3600 coins a day because people would still need to pay off their newly acquired hardware. 
I've been around since $5. At $5, I was the miner selling to pay off his hardware. I would hold when they were generated if the market was in my favor, and sell if the market turned bear. The difficulty since then has skyrocketed, but it's largely the same game it always was.
Nothing has changed except the price. It's all about the market.
