Truth is that there is pretty much 0 crypto adoption in Australia. Everyone uses Paywave, we have a stable financial system with stable banks, so crypto just doesnt offer much.

so technically, if they never sell the BCH they mine and keep buying BCH with their BTC, they eventually store enough value in BCH?

dunno who to believe, but the man denies it and sounds like he is restricted what he can say with contracts, likely FUD

pretty much you buy crypto to use, its not a speculative instrument, else u pay tax if u are using as investment
@_date: 2018-08-22 23:11:51
probably only use of crypto atm, can cash out crypto as paying for bills instead of exchanging to fiat and paying tax

Basically mining at a loss is subsidizing hodl ers

people are stupid and argue about BTC vs BCH. dont you think deeper that by forking bitcoin, now there is double the supply to mine - hence the miners will never let BCH fail. ideal scenario is where BTC and BCH are 1:1 value. that will maximise miner profits

read the pdf properly guys, it clearly states it isnt an audit or did they do proper accounting.

you forget he already sold all his LTC so he wouldnt have any (conflicted) interest in LTC
@_date: 2018-07-27 02:01:49
its ironic that the olds hodling drive shitboxes, while the ones that sold out at Jan drive lambos
@_date: 2018-04-21 00:59:31
If you listen to his videos he clearly states he is a content producer and does not trade on his own views, ie shit trader. A good trader won't open his mouth while he makes profitable trades. The ones that can, do, the ones that can't, teach and sell seminars and courses lol
@_date: 2017-07-17 03:21:34
anyone bought at 2500 and sold out at 2000?
