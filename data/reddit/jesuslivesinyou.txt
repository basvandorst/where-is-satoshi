It's only going up. I just put my last $1000 in. It's practically guaranteed to be $2000 once this little tiff gets fixed. If you're not all in on Bitcoin then you are a fucking noob.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:27:55
Bitcoin will be at 10,000 tomorrow. You wait and see.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:22:25
It's only going up! Bitcoin will be 100,000 soon.

Just wait until Facebook gets involved. Then see who buys bitcoins.

You can't stop bitcoin. It's guaranteed to go up.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:23:46
That's a good buy. Just wait until bitcoin is at 1 million and then see who's laughing!
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:20:10
You are the first of many to be owned by bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:06:58
This is PROOF that bitcoin is going to 10,000. Buy now before it's too late!

He fills me with pleasure. But seriously, bitcoin is going to burn more people than Enron.
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:05:08
You're probably screwed. Bitcoin is not secure and there's no one like the FDIC to protect you. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:24:26
The economy knows. We must not spend.

I just convinced my Grandma to invest 10,000 in Bitcoin! She just has to wait for the social security check to clear and then were good to go.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:43:03
Most everyone in Bitcoin is riding on the curtails of their investment inexperience.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:04:03
China will nationalize bitcoin and destory us all. You have been warned.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:21:37
Keep buying, take out a second mortgage if you have to. Bitcoin is only going up, up, up!

Only a noob sells. We need more suckers to buy in so we can make money. Spread the word.

This is why bitcoin is only for fucking idiots. There's no fair credit and bill act protecting the purchases. There is no FDIC protecting your "money." Get rid of this crap before it's too late.

Bitcoin is just a fad just like Myspace. Litecoin is the next Facebook.
