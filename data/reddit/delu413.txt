Any suggestions to invest in? I'm all ears. I've already invested in 803mine.com with 30 tokens. How do you feel about this one?

But even tho it looks like a ponzi scheme, ppl are still making money off of it,  ranked at  now and with people putting btc into now, they are now looking kind of legit?

Bought in at 6700 and 7700, made a profit of 2000 just off buying at those prices. 
Playing the ico game, find something real popular. Buy ico cheap on presale, cash out.

@_date: 2019-01-30 22:42:53
Haha in the Honda, nice

It's already been digital. We look at balances digitally everywhere. The questions actually is when will we be cashless.

What bank what area
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:49:59
But doesn't it state that buying (tokens) that I would get a fraction of the bitcoin mined 
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:19:30
Ok thanks for the input. Do you think I should still buy even though I'll only get a fraction on one bitcoin? Do you think it'll keep going up?
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:19:46
Roger that
