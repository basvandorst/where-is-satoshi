Thanks! In future we're looking into NFC, but right now the shop wouldn't be broadcasting the price - the user would be entering in the amount they have to pay from within the app. 
The main win from our point of view is that you don't need to think about wallet/QR codes at all - the app will show all merchants registered with us by closest first, so you can tap pay, enter in an amount and send.
For added fun we thought it would be cool to add a bit of friendly competition by earning points/achievements every time you do something bitcoin related, such as paying or depositing/withdrawing bitcoin.

Well with QR codes the merchant has to generate the code first - we've seen that quite often the person in a shop accepting bitcoin might not be one that knows lots about the currency and would also probably have to switch from their point of sale app to another app in order to generate the code. 
In terms of manual entry, I agree with you, there is scope for error but we see it almost as paying by cash - any errors would be reversible.

Businesses currently have their own Wyre-specific bitcoin wallet, which we would change regularly for them (and potentially allow them to change this themselves from within the app). 
I agree that there's definitely a lot of things to cover (which I guess makes it both interesting and lots of hard work), there seems to be a large focus on online payments right now but still hasn't been too much to encourage users to start using bitcoin in physical shops.

I wonder if it would be more nutritionally viable just to eat the cash...
