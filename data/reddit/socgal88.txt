B-team has a nice ring to it.

Since bitcoin has analogues like exchanges and online services, I think comparing bitcoin energy usage to the  SWIFT cooperative might make more sense.

Yeah, for now

I started mining two years ago and used most of the coins on SR.  I feel great about supporting the early economy, and I still have a decent amount of coins(~100).  Not enough to quit my day job.

Did you mean for this to be in r/bitcoin?

I guess this isn't a bad idea, but I'm not going to store my BTC at a bank out of principle.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:20:27
Sure it does

I wouldn't have BTC if it weren't for drugs.

How would people feel about the idea of crowd funding copyright IP with BTC?   For example, say I'm a skilled game developer and I don't like the direction a company has taken with their IP.  So I create a fan-made version and release it with enough btc funding to cover costs incurred.  I'm not sure how people feel about copyright infringement in the bitcoin community, so please share your thoughts.

I'm bored.  I don't think you used an American border since this is a European thread and you called a distance a km.
Open land border crossings with ~1km distance walk:
Costa Rica-Nicaragua
I don't think you are at any of these, but this is all my Googling could find.
Three reasons:
1. Transport country reserves.
2. Store personal reserves in a different country for asset protection.
3. Money laundering

I for one wouldn't care about the fate of BTC if quantum computers existed.. we should be demanding progress, not fighting it for the sake of 'wealth'

I also keep mine encrypted on a few USB drives.  But, I copy it until the entire drive is full.  Trust me, corruption is common on USB drives, keep it extra redundant.

That's what I was wondering, and after I turned everything on again it went through fine.  Thank you
