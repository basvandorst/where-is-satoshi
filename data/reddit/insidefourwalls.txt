That's no excuse to treat certain people like they are less than human. It's disturbing the way reddit treats sex workers. They act like they are all into sex and shit but oh no, a fair lady is getting money for sex. God forbid. Let's call her every name in the book and treat her like shit.

Ok, so is it just an online wallet now?

Man you're super condescending. I'm not even sure why I responded to you since you started off ranting about mainstream media. You seem incredibly angry and should probably try to figure out why that is. 
And you didn't even fully understnad my post. Your analysis of it was off but something tells me you are too clouded by anger by god knows what to really have any kind of meaningful exchange with you anyway.

Thanks, I suppose this will be more accurate. I guess, the very thin lines indicate less were traded at that point? I'm new to reading these types of charts.

Are you looking at coinbase or somewhere else? When I hover my mouse at the very top of the chart it says the $17 number for me.

Millennials were the first ones on bitcoin.

Relax. My point is the idea that millennials need to get on bitcoin is silly. It was always a surprisingly young crowd that was on it from the beginning. 
I bet if this sub did a poll it would show a lot of people in the late 20s/early 30s range.

Maybe the creators or whatever but everyone I knew that first bought bitcoin was born after 1983. It was a very young crowd years ago.
