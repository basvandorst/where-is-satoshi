Oh yeah, understandable - I'm actually not doing any big purchases, literally just over $150 dollars USD, which is why that weekly limit was killing me. Like I said, I really knew it would be fine if I purchased more BTC on another website, I just needed to double check because that's the type of person I am haha. But yeah, I completely understand what you mean. I don't plan on buying large amounts/investing in BTC at this moment

I don't know why it wouldn't be okay - but I just wanted to double check, like I said this is my first time using the whole BTC process so I was just unsure about the whole thing

I don't know why either. I just made an account a few weeks ago but didn't see the limit until now, or else I would have purchased bitcoins earlier. I uploaded my ID to get verified as well, but still the limit is $150 for some reason

I'm super new to bitcoin and I don't really plan to use it too much or invest too much - just for a few purchases I want to make online and that's pretty much it. Would you say coinbase would be alright for a beginner to purchase a bicoin and then move it to another most secure wallet (still online though, I'm not going to invest in a lot since I'm just starting)?

alright I will - but wouldn't you know if the total that you sent wasn't the full total if electrum took some out? like if you send 1 BTC, did the whole 1 BTC get there? Or was it 0.9999999 or whatever because eletrum took some out?
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:34:28
Well yeah I wasnt planning on using it as a wallet, rather just purchase it on there and then move it to another wallet online

Ah just came across that site as I read your comment  
@_date: 2017-06-27 07:53:22
nice cleared it up nicely thank you for that. so pretty much i dont have to be worried about adding the correct fee amount becuase electrum does it itself. im just gonna keep the slider at the default position in the middle when sending it
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:16:44
Ok got it, ill just leave it at the default. But does electrum charge/calculate the fee automatically and take it out of your wallet? Or do I have to add that fee onto whatever total I am sending? 
I dont have any bitcoins in my wallet just yet (I am waiting for my credit card to come in the mail to purchase the BTC), so it just shows up as 0  right now, which is why I am unsure
@_date: 2017-06-27 08:06:35
yup will do. one more thing roughly, how long does it take for an average transaction to arrive? know it varies by amount i send, but could i expect it to happen in a day/that same day or is it going to be spread out over several days?

Well shit.... Guess it took sometime to update but I just checked and looks like my limit was raised to 500 now!
