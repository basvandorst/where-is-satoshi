Uh taxes?  If he gets bitcoin (or cash) he can "forget" to claim the income.  Many cash businesses do that.  A Chinese food place I go recently started giving a 5% discount for cash.  There's only one way that's profitable over 3% credit card fees.

Cars are big, require special transportation to take them away, require someone to buy them from you, are expensive, etc etc.  That's why a camaro can go for 50% normal price at auction.  Probably the only time it doesn't is if there happens to be two people there who actually want it for themselves.  Otherwise, the people at these auctions are usually just buying to resell, and so have to get things at a discount.
I'd wager more liquid things like silver and gold go for pretty darn near their street value.

use coinbase or bitpay, probably.

The article said that "in many cases" they used BitPay to immediately convert to dollars.

They said they used bitpay, so they never had bitcoins.  Bitpay got the bitcoins and they got dollars.  They didn't make a profit off the appreciation.

Your answer is logical but unrealistic.   How is HashFast supposed to come up with $55,000 per order?  Is this what it means to accept bitcoin? If so, you can count out pretty much everyone.
There needs to be a realistic answer here.... a middle ground.  I see two possible options:
1.) When using BitPay, the merchant has to specify refund windows, during that time, BitPay has to hold onto the bitcoins so that it's possible to refund them.  This puts a lot of risk into BitPay's hands, and likely would drive up costs so far that merchants wouldn't want to deal with them.
2.) Merchants should specify that they're converting immediately to fiat and will refund the same fiat value in BTC for refunds.  Thus, if btc goes down, you get more for a refund, if it goes up, you get less.  This is the most realistic solution.  I guarantee you that anyone who is actually willing to give refunds is not taking bitcoin purely for speculative purposes.  That's way too risky for most businesses.

If this lawsuit forces HashFast to pay in bitcoins (which they never actually had because they used BitPay), it will be really really bad for bitcoin.  Imagine all those stores that want to accept bitcoin, but, if they use BitPay or another middleman to convert to fiat... now they have to worry about people asking for refunds after bitcoin skyrockets. This will be a huge negative incentive to accept bitcoin.  Who wants to risk bitcoin suddenly jumping 10x and people then ask for 10x the money they gave you in refunds, when you never actually saw the bitcoins yourself?

Neat idea, but I'm pretty sure coinstar would have to get a special money exchange license that would make this significantly non-trivial, and that's not even taking into consideration needing to update the software on all their machines.  It's just not going to happen.
