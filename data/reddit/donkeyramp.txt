I'm just curious, could he have adopted instead of buying?  I'm sure there are a few redditors out there that have an opinion on this matter..  Please, lets hear it reddit!  
Jesus...  I'm sure he gets it by now, stfu.

lol I know it was a bit trollish of me.  Just thought it was funny.  And a bit ironic maybe, I dunno.

I'm just blown away by some of the responses to this.  How people can understand things like advanced economics and computer science (or whatever the fuck you wanna call this) but still manage to spell "their" wrong..  "there fault?"  And right smack dab after that, someone uses "you're" wrong.  If "you're strategy is".  I mean.  Holy fuck.  I'm no genius.  I barely understand what the fuck you guys are talking about, but shit like that sticks out like a "soar thumb"  Oh wait.  Sore thumb.  There we go.  ROFL.  Sorry, had a rough day.  I mean are you fuckers doing this on purpose or what?  How can you be smart enough to be involved in this discussion, but dumb enough to not know the difference between their, there and you're, your.  Mind = blown.

Fair enough.

Clever clever.  I was genuinely curious, but I forgot this is reddit, so my apologies.

And you're mad cause I had a point, so you resort to childish name-calling.  Yeah, I'm a fuck wit as in, I'll fuck your witless brain, so just go home, game is over.  Thanks for playing though.  PEACE!

I was just as nice as he was.  "instead of complaining on reddit" that sounds like something a dick would say.  I didn't ask for help, I was venting.  Where in what I said did I say, Help my obi-wan you're my only hope?  So u can fuck off too thanks.  :)

F* circle.  They like closing accounts for no good reason.

Good assumption, but I have actually sent support 2x emails and haven't heard back yet.  But thanks for the quirky advice.
