I still don't understand how they are going to buy this currency if their debit cards are restricted. and the Island that is experimenting with the supernet only has a population of 1000 and is a test experiment? and when i tried to signup on the drakema web portal my registration didn't go through though i was just testing from the usa.

it doesnt add value? in a world of self driving cars this is needed? Parking fees serve this purpose now:
incentive to keep homeless people and others from staying there.
fees for enforcement
fees for upkeep of that parking area and road.
crypto world:
automatically could do these things with smaller fees because.
alert people with network they must move or be fined,
network alert enforcer, less enforcers
works seemlessly with selfdriving cars
variable pricing due to predicted demand find cheeper parking
