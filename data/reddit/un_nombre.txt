Hi, another Frenchie here. I too use Bitstamp. Sent them 2 SEPA wires, both got processed within 24-36h with no verification needed and no problems whatsoever.   
I actually prefer Bitstamp's interface and lack of lag compared to MtGox, but once you've transferred fiat and bought BtC, you're free to transfer them to any other exchange and trade there. Although MtGox has limits on withdrawals if you're not verified, it has much more movement and is often better for day-trading. When you're done, you can then transfer your Btc back to Bitstamp for withdrawal.    
Finally, I prefer to trade in USD simply because this seems to be the preferred fiat equivalent on most exchanges, including the biggest one, MtGox. Also, Bitstamp deals in USD only and will automatically convert your EUR anyway (although free of charge).
Hope this helps.    
Edit: Formatting, some precisions.

i think he means transactions on an exchange, not on the bitcoin network. Trading orders placed through the API are still able to go through apparently.

Pretty much too late already imo. I'm waiting for a batch 3 Avalon myself, and although i still believe i'll make my btc back someday, i think that will pretty much be the last profitable generation.    
There's a lot of chips being sold by Avalon that will be mounted on more or less DIY pcbs soon, so expect a pretty big increase in hashrate sometime around august. By then, even 60 or 90 gigahashes will be the equivalent of what a couple of good GPUs were producing 6 months ago. On the other hand, there will probably be more ASIC options available, and at cheaper prices too, but again, since their hashing power will be mitigated by the increased difficulty, by then it'll be more or less the equivalent of mining with a GPU.    
This mining thing is turning into a whole other game entirely. You can still try to mine other cryptocoins though, but then again, many GPU farms are thinking (and doing) the same thing, so...

Well, i'd love it if you could explain what you watch for, kind sir. 
I've actually registered my first acount on Reddit just to ask that. You can PM me if you prefer not to make this too "public", but even though i have my own thoughts about this, i'm really curious about your strategy.

MtGox is down. So there's that.

Well, basically, unless you have some impressive hashing power at your disposal, you don't have much choice and pools are pretty much the only way to go. Even if you have an ASIC, going solo makes less and less sense as the difficulty keeps ramping up.

You can check the bitminter java client (go to  and in the menu go to tools, then Bitminter Client). This should give you an idea of how much Mh/s you can expect from each machine.

Glad you found this helpful. Worst case scenario you'll have a few GPUs to play games with, or you can always sell them back. As long as you're having fun with this whole thing and not betting the farm on it, i'd say you're pretty much good to go!

I love you all. Now kiss.

Didn't sell anything. Bought half @ 60-70, other half @ 160. Put in most of what i had by conviction in the kind of society that Bitcoin can help create.
  
  No idea if this is the end or a welcome correction. I don't have anything against making money, but this frenetic growth was unhealthy, and even a bit sickening. I want a new financial system and society model more than i want instant profits. Time will tell whether i'm a naive and poor idealist or simply naive :)

I personally don't care much for it because i doubt that it can have a future independent from Bitcoin. If you look on Btc-e, the Ltc/Btc ratio often remains constant during price swings, which means that whenever Bitcoin moves, Litecoin follows it with more or less the same relative amplitudes.    
It seems that its main value right now, imo, is its appeal to the GPU mining farms that will be (or already are) outgunned in the Bitcoin hashpower race, but even then it's mainly used as a vehicle to buy back some Btc. While this may change in the future, right now, there's not many things you can do with Litecoin besides daytrading it and buying some Bitcoins.    
I may be completely wrong though, but for me Litecoin does not offer enough added value compared to Bitcoin to stand on its own. That does not mean it will not rise to some substantial percentage (some speculate up to 20-25%) of the Btc value someday, as many predict and hope. Its supposedly soon-to-come inclusion on MtGox should probably help in that regard as well. But as long as its valuation remains locked to Btc, then it will never be autonomous enough to be anything else than a gateway to Bitcoin.    
My 2 mBtc :)
