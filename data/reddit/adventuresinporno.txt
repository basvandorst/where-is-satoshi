Ahh yes. The ole' "not'a'spousta". You should report them to the crypto authorities so they'll stop being "wrong".

Oy vey.


Verbatim. This is you using english. The obvious insinuation that it IS succeeding at BEing profitable. Your exact words.

Ahh good ole syntax attack. You really will take any bait eh? Stick with what you know I guess. If you call the last four months of BTC "failing" you might need to invest in a dictionary.

Sorry that comment was too much for you to grasp. Maybe take that as a sign?

How can a currency "be profitable"? Can you explain that? I know speculation and exchanges can be profitable, but how is profitability suposed to be a trait of a currency?
Look that up in yör vast library of economics literature and get back to me.

�� right. Tell that to china. What a joke. This magic "supposed to" phrase you use is a bit daft when faced with reality. You hold more, you can throw more. That's the game.

HAaaha. Don't have an idea about a lot of things apparently.
"Gee, why would anyone ever try to make a profit on a speculative market? I'm super smart."

I've never met a living black mirror before. It's absolutely facinating.

Awe, did you fail to use language properly and now expect that everyone else should cover for yore mistakes?
What's the context behind your continual failure to make a salient point while still seeing value in your own contributions?
