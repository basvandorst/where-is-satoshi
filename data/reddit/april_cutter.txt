They're also still making Beanie Babies this year.
They're worth about $5 a bean bag these days, pretty stable. Far cry from their raging popularity in the 90s.
Wonder when we'll see the 'ole Bitcoin correction. Would be a hilarious gas.

Did you just compare the world of beanie babies, spanning the Olympics to multinational Fortune 500 corporations to the English Royal Family and Billion-dollar sports franchises and reinventing the very paradigm of stuffing a felt bag full of beans to a digital coin used primarily for tipping cam models + get-rich-quick schemes? 
I get that beanie babies don't make sense to you, but let's not pretend I'm not the smartest genius on Earth. So smart, in fact, that most of my money comes not from any businesses I've created, but pure speculation?

Bags of beans are going to be hot man. Invest now. Nowhere to go but up. Tesla too! I own a lot of TSLA stock, so uh ... invest in TSLA! I need the stock price to go up so I can unload this shit.
TSLA is also ... the wave of the future ... new paradigms amongst paradigms .... bigger than Einstein ... financial institutions brought to their knees. You know all this big grandiose talk, but you'll get rich too! Just invest! Trust me, I'm an anonymous fucktard Redditor, average age 14, put your 401k in dis shit man.

It's not really a currency though. You can't buy a house or car with bitcoin really. It's speculative garbage. You can say it's sort of like a commodity in that it's a lump of shit you hold on to, speculate, and then convert into "real currency" that can actually buy you 99% of products on Earth, unlike Bitcoin, which is more like &lt;0.01% of available products and services on Earth.
u/OnSnowWhiteWings is absolutely correct. If you're heavily invested in BTC, you're very incentivized to convince OTHERS it's a great, real, legit investment that has nowhere to go but UP indefinitely. That's so the value can get pumped EVEN MORE before the inevitable ass-fucking of the century.
Almost no one, not even techies in SFC, give that much of a fuck about the practical use of the currency. Yes, that's talked about, as a kind of ... thin, shakey "premise" on why it's such the invention of the century, but in reality ... 98% of the conversation is "which new coin is going to explode man" and how to make your millions.
Lol ... this is like Beanie Babies and every other fucking bubble.

No one knows who created Bitcoin. The masked 'creator' probably has billions of 'unregistered' coins on his own secret wallet. You have no idea what backdoors he built in; by design they are hidden from the moronic masses.

Bitcoin is pure speculation/ gambling. But congrats on the win, I suppose.
Eventually someone holding this speculative 'hot potato' is going to eat a fist full of shit. Lol.
