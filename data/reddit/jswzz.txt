So 60 checks then?

Im saying I can look at how others reacted to a set of circumstances (cards) in the past and use it to better inform my next play. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:35:04
Couldn’t agree more

So your issue was that my percentage was too high? Can you please explain better for my simple brain. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:19:55
Wait is that bad?

So poker is all luck too because no one knows anything for sure 
Edit: /s because it wasn’t obvious

The Gambler’s Fallacy holds true for events that are truly random. If a stock price increases a predictably based on news, then it is not truly random.

Neither is poker but you can still perform better than chance given knowledge of past events

The problem is with lack of education to understand the risks. Taking out loans assuming that an unsustainable market will continue to show exceptional or increasing growth is not the lender’s fault

Please see yourself out of this thread

With enough hands you have probability trees. If I have history on someone else I know their tendencies, just like if I see how a security’s chart has reacted to news in the past. I can say guy A usually raises 2-2.5x with weak hands in position when he is winning, just like I can say security A usually jumps 15% on good news during Q1 or something like that.

Look at my example. It can be used to generalize about tendencies in poker.

Right it won’t, unless you can find a way to categorize types of players. Say, somehow you studied a set of players and could prove that all players who wear hats at the table will fold easily, then that would be applicable to the next hat-wearing player who joins the game*
*Note that this is hypothetical because y’all keep trying to poke holes in my hypotheticals like that is some kind of damn feat. 
So maybe only focus on one player and play him 1v1 when you know his tendencies. There was a big controversy when a high roller lost about 2 mil playing heads up with a young kid playing Omaha because he studied the guy’s hand history.

Do you not know how earnings work?

Wow it really works! Thanks Elon Musk/John McAfee/Whoever’s tweet this is! Totally not a scam and I’m definitely not replying to a twitter handle that’s 1 character off from the actual celeb’s!
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:38:22
Right that’s why in this analogy you would research trends specific to that player 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:44:04
That’s a good point, but if you take all the hands you’ve been dealt in every game so far, you can do better than if you weren’t doing any analysis.

False.
