I'm already planning to donate to whoever runs against him.  That was literally my first thought when I saw the bill.
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:10:23
Why isn't it a good long term investment?  
@_date: 2015-05-01 17:32:43
The bill covers both.
@_date: 2015-05-04 17:55:42
I'm also wondering if the price is too high.  I posted a thread in to ask them but they filtered my submission(I'm guessing because it's related to bitcoin?)

The other value part is broad and open ended, basically encompassing any non-consumable business that wants to accept bitcoin.  But look at the virtual currency to virtual currency conversion.  This will stifle side-chains since they would need a license to convert side-chain token to bitcoin token.  This bill is way too overbearing and broad.
@_date: 2015-05-01 18:26:53
It covers virtual currency converted to "other value" and virtual currency converted to virtual currency.  It basically covers everything.

You are wrong to imply that licensing and regulation will ensure that bitcoin businesses will be able to obtain banking relationships simply because they have more regulations.  That fallacy is in your first paragraph.  
  
Then you go on to insinuate that if 9/11 was financed in whole or in part by bitcoin that bitcoin would be dead.  We didn't outlaw anything else that facilitated 9/11 so I don't see where your example for that is.
  
Looks like just a bunch of fear mongering on your part.

In order to have a bitcoin business in California, in addition to the other licenses you will need, you will need to pay the following.
  
License Application: $3500  
License: $5000  
Annual License Renewal: $2500  
Annual physical location(per location) license: $125
  
  
Just to get started it will cost you $8500 and $2625 every year after for just one physical business location.  And this is just for California!
  
Good luck Entrepreneurs!  Silicon Valley is for the big boys and girls with deep pockets.  No more starting companies in your garage on a shoe string budget.

There was investment before and after and I have seen nothing that proves that the NY License has had any impact positive of negative, yet.  But we have seen plenty of existing bitcoin businesses speak out and state that the NY License is overreaching and redundant given current regulations.  Some have implied that they would have to stop doing business in NY if it passed in its current form.


  
10k is not a joke, and it's not even close to funny when you compound it with 50 other states that are going to follow suit.  Get real!  That's 500k to go national, just for bitcoin licenses not even the existing licenses that are needed to be an MSB and the internal costs of complying with AML\KYC!
@_date: 2015-05-01 18:52:03
If the business is a matching service and does not transact in or hold a virtual currency on behalf of others, then it isn't affected.  An example is craigslist who is a listing service and doesn't take part in the actual transactions.

Congratulations!

So what you're saying is, that you're easy?  Give me more bitcoin naow!!

Capital gains.  People try and max out what they can put into a Roth IRA every year because they don't have to pay long term capital gains when they are able to cash out at age 59.5.  Even though I hold bitcoin itself, I'm thinking about doing this too for long term investment.  If bitcoin is still around in a couple of decades when I retire, the money I could save on capital gains might dwarf the short term premium.
@_date: 2015-05-01 16:28:52
How will it reduce scams when scammers aren't going to comply anyway?  Your statement that it provides a clearer environment for heavy hitters is a fallacy, they do not need a clearer environment, the current environment has not stopped a billion dollars of investment from venture capitals over the last several years.  That statement is also proof that the regulation is too much because when regulation only allows those with money and power to participate, you have already stifled an entire industry.

If you're looking to trade, I would use coinbase.com over circle, coinbase has their own exchange you can trade on and sending bitcoin and cash between your wallets is instant.  Coinbase also innovates more and participates in the bitcoin community above and beyond just speaking at events.

You may regret that some day. ;)

That 3% is **3 Billion** Neucoins.  There will be 100 Billion Neucoins.  Satoshi didn't pre-mine any coins.
@_date: 2015-04-30 20:33:24
Many(most?) people who hold bitcoin are holding it because of its inherent feature of being deflationary.  Take that away and we might as well be holding Dogecoins.
@_date: 2015-04-30 20:46:20
Why not?  You can have centralized code and a decentralized and distributed network at the same time.  We basically have that now..

This one is even better.  I wonder how many times they have kicked themselves since then.

What is your definition of full adoption and why would we want it?
  
We don't want full adoption, we don't even know what "full adoption" means.  We want bitcoin to make us rich and we don't care how that happens.  We know it won't happen if you keep printing more of them, that is for sure.
  
Just for your education:  There are 100,000,000 Satoshis(base spendable unit) per bitcoin.  100 Satoshis is equal to 1 bit, so there are 1 million bits in a bitcoin.

All Cloud Mining is a scam!  If they could sell you resources that made you money, they would literally be giving away money.  No one is going to do that! 
@_date: 2015-04-30 22:51:42
You're worried about an illusion.  As the block reward diminishes, the price will rise to a point where the reward for mining is at pace with the cost of mining.  We only need mass adoption to get rich right now.  We don't need mass adoption to get rich, we just need to live through the next few block reward halvings in lieu of that adoption.

Probably fell for some cloud mining scam.
@_date: 2015-04-30 22:20:10
I'm going to assume that you bought shares of cloud mining contracts.  Congratulations on throwing away your money.  Next time, buy and hold bitcoin directly.  Cloud mining is a scam.

It's normal for someone starting 6 years and 15 weeks after bitcoin launched.

The developers pre-primed and are sitting on 3 Billion Neucoin just waiting for some suckers to put money into it so they can cash out.  Don't be that sucker.

It's backwards.
@_date: 2015-04-30 22:53:01
We're both assuming until they clarify.  They could just have easily bought cloud mining shares..

I like how they are hiding their subscription numbers in their sub.  Everything about this thing smells like a pump and dump scam.
