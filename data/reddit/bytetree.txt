The cumulative average median of a transaction on the Bitcoin Network reaches $160 this week. We take the median transaction value in each block to give a clearer indication of spend. We found the average TX Value (Total spend / number of transactions) to be a poor indicator of network traffic. You can view this and other metrics live on our platform - [

Hashrate hit an all-time high in late October, yes. This caused difficulty to also reach an all time high. Miners were unable to remain profitable at this new difficulty level (price dropped) so hash rate then dropped back and is currently lower than the all-time-high - [ Hope that helps :)

Not necessarily, it is more a case of "so watch the demand side closely". The positive side of the story is that on-chain transaction volumes continue to grow over the long run. The busiest day in 2013 was less than the slowest day in 2018.

$17 million in first spend is a drop in the ocean but also a very unusually large figure for that category. The price was already dropping but the spike caused it to downfall quite quickly in a couple of hours. The difference in average price was only around $400 (compared to the price 24h previous). Currently, the price seems to be settling around $8100.
@_date: 2019-11-04 10:00:14
It does vary, yes. Which is why we use a 7day average for short term comparisons. You will notice at [ that we typically look over longer periods of 1 month and 1 quarter in order to smooth the short term volatility.

Okay, thanks. Yes, we have a different methodology to Bitinfo. While they look at the median value of all the transactions within a day, we look at the median transaction value within each block and then present it as a rolling average. We think this gives a cleaner transaction value number. It's a big topic for us at ByteTree. Since network demand is a key driver of the price, we are trying to refine the transaction value data in an objective and repeatable way, to get as clean of a metric on network demand as possible. Lots in the pipeline... watch this space!

Thank-you for your fruity contribution. Why did miners turn off their equipment? 
Perhaps they couldn't keep up their profitability as the hash race hotted up.
@_date: 2019-11-13 11:50:54
Looking at the Dec'18 bottom.... the 6th October 2018 was the first step down. Followed by a further three big downward adjustments. This aligned with the capitulation we saw before the beginning of this current cycle. Watching this closely!

Not especially. It's actually inaccurate... the adjustments in late 2018 were during a bear market. PlanB has some interesting concepts but they're largely unsubstantiated with respect to price action. We see difficulty adjustments more of an indicator of miner's profit margins (ie. how competitive the mining market is). Difficulty doesn't drive price, price drives difficulty. The only time a fall in price will not decrease the difficulty level is when profit margins are wide. This is apparent in 2018 bear market when difficulty continued to rise despite falling prices. This latest drop indicates that margins are tight. Makes sense considering upcoming block reward halving. Miners are pushing hard (ie. smaller margins) to make the most of the 12.5 BTC reward era.

@_date: 2019-11-06 08:25:33
Fair point. There could be a higher volume of low-value transactions. My thoughts are that if the capacity is shrinking then the overall appetite is less. Not sure how to validate that right now, open to suggestions...
@_date: 2019-08-29 21:01:58
I get your point. It seems slightly counter intuitive that a $100MM transaction can pay the same as a $1 transaction in fees. Although, at the same time, that is the beauty the Bitcoin Network. It offers truly democratic  and decentralized access to a global, public settlement infrastructure... 
As it happens we do also track fees as a % of BTC transacted, we thought it was an interesting metric too. It's under the "network section" - [ In case you're not familiar with bps, 100 bps is equal to 1%. Eg. 0.96bps = 0.0096%
@_date: 2019-08-29 21:10:46
I think there will be other networks (or layer 2 solutions) that will account for the lower valued transactions in the long-run. Litecoin serves the purpose of a low-value payment network pretty well in terms of lower price volatility, lower fees and faster transaction times than bitcoin. Don't get me wrong, I would much prefer to keep value in bitcoin than Litecoin, but for short term use for low-value payments... Litecoin does a pretty good job. I wrote a short analysis on it here - [

@_date: 2019-08-29 21:07:37
Great point. Capacity will need to increase, or, layer two networks will support higher throughput which will in turn generate the value to pay higher fees. As an example, the liquid network (blockstream) may transfer $1Bn per day on a side-chain through inter-exchange settlements, settling the net balance once or twice a day on the main chain. Since there are multiple high value transactions, the fees from each transaction can be aggregated. This justifies a high fee to be paid for the bytes used on the Bitcoin Network. As you say, this still requires some sort of capacity increase, since the blocks will need to be full in order to drive up higher fees (just because they can be afforded doesn't mean they'll be paid by choice!). Long-term I hope to see the Bitcoin Network as the central drive-chain for a plethora of high value, inter-continental, cross-industry, possibly even interplanetary settlements ;-)

Gradual build up of sells, minimal buys. Big on-chain movement of $1.2bn at 3pm BST correlates to accelerating fall in price (as the order book is eaten up). It looks like this was "the tipping point" that triggered short term panic. The chart shows price vs. tx volume over the past 32hrs.
