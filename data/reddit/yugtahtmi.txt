Haha.  I mean look at George Foreman.  He was worth nothing and then signed on for the grill andade $250 mil from a infomercial product.

It's probably still more than what he would have given is cash.

I'm buying in hoping to hit a new all time high by 2016.  I think we'll hit 7-10,000 by 2020.

Agreed.  I just opened a Circle account today and it was a breeze.  I still prefer Coinbase's website though.

Hello Adrian,
Do you know if a $ hold would be placed on my credit card for the amount of BTC purchased while waiting for the ACH transfer to clear?
@_date: 2015-03-10 03:17:40
I bought in at 240, I hope you're wrong about 195 haha
@_date: 2015-03-10 00:02:00
Easy integration hopefully.

I believe you can be verified immediately with a bunch of info that allows you up to $100 instant buy, after 30 days as a user you go up to Level 2 which would open up the instant buy to $1000 if I'm reading the site right.

I've been watching all day.  I just got my first coins in the last 2 weeks.  I feel lucky to be knocking on 300 so soon.
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:54:15
Exactly.  I'm treating this money like it's my entertainment fund, so if I loose it I'm not out on the street.
@_date: 2015-03-13 02:34:52
Gotcha...  Thanks for the reply and well done on excellent customer service.  It's a pleasant break from the majority of other companies out there.

I assume it places a hold on your MasterCard until the bank transfer clears?
@_date: 2015-02-25 05:26:33
It's the implication. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 01:07:05
Knock. Knock.

It amazes me the thickness of some men.
@_date: 2015-03-12 23:05:59
Do they even place a hold on the credit card?
@_date: 2015-02-24 08:31:42
Exactly, it was there ace in the hole as insurance incase they lost this.  Extra time can't be bad.
