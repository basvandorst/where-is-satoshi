This Is Good For BitCoin.

Yah, he’s actually said several good things about BitCoin over time. He’s said that any organization with over $100B in equity is worth considering investing in, and that BitCoin interests him (before he started investing himself). People love to hate him, but he’s a smart dude &amp; personally owns BitCoin as part of his diverse portfolio. Respect.

The [Raspberry Pi 4]( just came onto the market, for $35. 
Would it be possible to pair this efficient piece of tech with a small solar panel, and mine BitCoin at a profitable hash-rate?
I expect the resulting hash-rate to be low, but since energy &amp; equipment costs are the expensive parts of mining (and the energy is "free") the break-even point would be determined upon the time it takes to achieve $35+SD Card+Solar Panel.
What do you think?

That's a pretty huge advantage.

How have loans (that were originated prior to the mass-inflation) been affected? 
*For Example*: Let's say I took out a loan for 50 million Bs, 2 years ago, with a fixed interest rate. Then, this inflation occurred. Have banks tried to restructure their previous loans, or are they just allowing easier pay-off?
I ask because inflation makes loan pay-off **much** easier, due to money being worth less now. It isn't necessarily a bad idea to take out a loan if you predict inflation will continue to advance rapidly...
