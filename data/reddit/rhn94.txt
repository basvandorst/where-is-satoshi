lol meaningless and trivial 'correction' considering you can't use bitcoin easily as a currency and the fact that there are other cryptos that are functionally better than bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:11:05
uh no... as long as bitcoin is based on blockchain, there will always be better 
also all the lightning network stuff is like patching the dry wall of a building hoping the structure will take more load
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:00:29
what are you ? the crypto thought police?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:56:53
lol nice vague "criticism"
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:36:20
lol nice fallacy; we're stating objective points here and your only comeback is that? 
people saying that about btc in 2014 weren't talking about the problems we are today, this isn't religion or magic..
but I guess a self confessed btc expert like you (who are becoming a meme at this point) can't be wrong lmao

lol alright conspiritard
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:58:26
lol that's the thing with being non-technical, it will never be the most objective thing &amp; will be warped by the view of the person "translating" it..
if you want to invest money &amp; make money from this thing you have to get technical; if it was free money it wouldn't be easy (just lucky)

lol he's an infamous cult dude around here; He's exactly the culmination of 3, 4, 6, 7
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:28:17
calm down with the cult talk.. damn..
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:55:00
lmao alright edgelord; lemme guess, you're a hardcore liberetardian
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:01:22
lol calm down conspiritard; just because people have criticisms doesn't make them shills.. you people are getting real cultish
@_date: 2017-03-09 00:37:42
Is that why they have this?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:23
you don't know how economics works do you? lmao, reading reddit comments doesn't make you an intellectual
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:54
lol no you child, like blaming a plumber for poor sewage infrastructure
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:10:24
lmao alright edgelord; put the bong down
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:02:53
sure, same with physics; but a physicist still knows more about physics than a rando edgelord
It's one thing to criticize an opinion, another thing to dismiss an entire profession
