Lol @ your accusations. I have had no prior contact with you, period.

The joke is on you, sir. I bought twenty feeshares in the "IPO" and it was the easiest $2400 I've made in my life. I always hear about how terrible RS/coinhunter/whatever is on reddit, and bitcointalk, but I have confidence in the guy. 
His anonymity is not a problem. I try to stay as stealthy as possible. Why should he not be able to do the same? Also, if he suddenly takes down the site, I don't see how knowing his identity will allow me to immediately get my coins back. The FBI is still trying to acquire coins from DPR! I love how you say these things while being a ripple advocate. 
Regarding the Microcash fisaco, if he's willing to take 200 BTC @ 5 (about $1000 USD), he surely would have walked away from mcxnow (MicroCashNOW) months ago. MCXnow has been significantly profitable for him. I'm not trying to dog mtrlt, but he was given over $7000 for his GPU Primecoin miner, and has abandoned the project. The miner is barely functional. So is the coder of Reaper is a fake or phony? Come on, it's nearly the same situation. RS has spoken about how he does not like coding Micro Cash, and how he got "stuck" with it.  
It's clear to me that he's dedicated to the integrity of his site, and I've learned over the months to not trust anything anyone says on reddit regarding crypto because nearly everyone has an agenda, and nearly everyone is wrong. 
Edit: You're wrong. I'm an investor. I've gotten a lot out of MCXNow and other alt. exchanges. Significantly more than I would have ONLY playing with BTC. I've learned how to trade via various troll boxes, and have had gains because of them.
