there’s less of a deflationary asset entering the market everyday. half as much. bitcoin’s worth is partly based on the cost of mining it, the energy. each block still takes as much energy and costs as much but you get half as much reward. price has always increased as such. it’s a fair place in time to aim to be in position by.

link? I assume he’s claiming every bitcoin on their storage system isn’t backed one to one ergo they sell you CoinbaseBtc until you go to use it or withdraw and then they give you actual BTC. banks do this with QE. that was the concept behind the proof of keys day in January. Basically a crypto bank run to prove liquidity. there are much shadier places I’d worry about than Coinbase doing this but if it came out they were it would be a huge deal.

leverage noob here - can y'all explain the potential effects of this supposed 100 million dollar position getting liquidated? would said whale be forced to market buy 100million in bitcoins? where exactly does the short get liquidated into? the market or the exchange or the long'er on the other side? its not like a market buy of 100 million on their exchange engages instantly and ergo btc goes to 19k on their exchange instantly, correct? that just seems so absurd to me. thanks!
