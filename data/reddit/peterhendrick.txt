What are you talking about “borrow” and “their” code?
Whose source code? The open source project that Satoshi started and gave everyone in the world the right to use copy modify and redistribute without restriction?

Coinbase is a good exchange, but you will want to move your funds to a wallet in your control. Personally, I like the bitcoin .com wallet app. I've used it for years as a hot wallet for smaller amounts.
If you want to store larger amounts, I suggest cold storage. The difference between cold storage and hot storage is cold storage is offline.
But! The important point here is that if you keep your funds on coinbase, then they are coinbase's bitcoins, not yours. You don't actually own the bitcoin until they are in an address where you are the only one with access to the private keys.
Not your keys, not your bitcoin. I suggest watching this full video. [

Do you have any good guides you’d recommend? I’d love to do more of this.

The tx fee can rise literally any time of any day. How can you not expect that?
You’re correct that the fee market eliminates real world users. Pretty soon the fee market will ruin bitcoin’s high price and market dominance.
I for the life of me cannot understand why people would celebrate the fee market and a limit on tx throughput.

If the fees are up long enough, some txs get kicked out of the mempool as was seen in 2017. Yes, the txs are being lost.

Xav don’t waste your energy here. Years ago there were $50 fees and the people here not only don’t see it as a problem, but they celebrate it.

This happens today and is ongoing in BTC.

The attacker didn't use strong scriptSigs in their attacking txs, so a dev took the coins. Since the txs are sigOp heavy, it will take a few days for all of them to be included in a block. Only 20,000 sigOps are allowed in a single block, this was part of the exploit of the attack. Now the attacker lost the coins used in the attacking tx.

So it’s been said. I don’t buy it.
Failure is txs not being confirmed. Failure is leaving the user uncertain of whether or not their tx will go through.
