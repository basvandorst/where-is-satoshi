If you think it can't be compared to a stock then maybe you should narrow 'no regulated exchange' to 'no regulated forex exchange.' Hard to fault someone comparing it to a stock when your claim includes stock exchanges.

This is a terrible idea

Those people are destined to lose money. If you only get in it because it's risen a lot then you're gonna want out when it dips. This also includes people who think crypto is the future but not Bitcoin, yet hold Bitcoin.

How come? I mean, where do they make their money?

If Bitcoin has no intrinsic value then at what point, and why, can you say the bubble has fully burst, and at what point it started? Have we been in a bubble since it increased over $400?

Favorability of coverage seems largely dependant on the direction it's moving.

Depends on how much of each.
It would be hard for me to value the gold. I don't know what amount is in your hand and I don't know the going rate per unit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:57:33
How would that change things?

If you're not financially dependent in any way then I think you can fairly suggest that she withhold judgment on your finances. If not, she's probably right.

What the hell is this guy talking about? How does bitcoin enable him to talk? He's on twitter. Why don't rich people want you to say anything? Is that why a bunch of them got together and invented twitter?
These claims are so vague you can fabricate some meaning that supports them but the tweet is so unspecific that it means nothing by itself.

It's effectively the same thing
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:11:58


Which is how much?

I'm just an onlooker, and to be frank, not optimistic about Bitcoin or crypto long term. However, your reasoning is sound and worth observing. If you hold Bitcoin and this volatility shakes your confidence then it seems you had no good reason to buy in the first place. 
Assuming something will be worth more in the future strictly because it went up a lot in the past is going to lead to panic everytime it goes down. 
True Bitcoin proponents, while I disagree with them, are making a calculated bet and I respect that. The people buying without conviction for the project are in for a world of hurt and will likely lose money even if Bitcoin rises long term.

Some value in centralization?

what happened to the bitcoins that were "lost?" did everyone recover them?
@_date: 2014-04-01 19:15:41
isn't the whole point of bitcoin to exist outside of these broken channels?
@_date: 2014-01-02 04:04:47


Well this is a bit dramatic.

Non-bitcoiner here. Do these guys ever get caught? Do the coins get recovered. Is that technically possible?

it's not a zero sum game

Why don't the developers just lower or eliminate the threshold (from 95%) for Segwit adoption?

I'm also curious
