If there's another earthquake that support will drop to 3000 feet

You're absolutely right, I think people disagreeing with me on this are attaching too much emotion to holding their btc, which is normal but to assume that it is impossible to see btc go 300$ lower is even more ridiculous hahah we've seen it do way worse

Yeah could be in, could also very much go to 3k and lower, anything is possible I'm just going to rely on technical analysis for this one (2-3k was just an assumption but Im waiting for the trend to change) could be anytime at any price

No I have stop buy limit at 4k so even if it doesn't go to 2k I buy back before it runs up

Ive been holding since the top.. sold at 6k and waiting patiently to buy back the capitulation it'll be sweet if it goes to 3k and potentially 2k so I'm with you on this one

Hahah yeah maybe I wasn't clear, but when I bought btc (at ath) I was a hodler and had no idea how to trade. Then I learnt how to trade in the span of this entire year so when I saw the 8 month long pattern breakin bearish I sold everything at 6k and now I'm waiting either for it to go down to 2-3k or for a change in the daily trend. the bulls will eventually rise again at some point  lol

It needs volume supporting it and a v shaped recovery (not what we saw in the last week) it'll be more intense
