Yes and you're wasting your time and electricity blah blah blah. GPU mining BTC has been long dead. Just game with it.
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:41:15
Antminer S1
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:31:29
Yes.. very good
@_date: 2014-11-22 04:03:05
Great vid
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:48:01
I recently setup a P2pool node.. Server is hosted in Atlanta, GA
@_date: 2014-12-12 02:44:27
Good point
I was set on PS4. I'm not so sure now. Guess I'll start looking for the best Xboxone system with BTC deal too. Newegg?
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:27:56
lol sounds like my wife. I think my entire family is fucking sick of hearing about Bitcoin. Too bad.
@_date: 2014-06-30 02:19:52
Yup.. just ordered two. I do confess I paid with FIAT. I hodl my coins.
take care
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:24:35
I'm going to buy one when I get 2 more mining days in.
@_date: 2014-08-21 00:00:08
Just make sure you have the lastest s1 firmware. S1 (With latest FW) and S3 are fine on P2pool. S2.. not so much.
@_date: 2014-12-10 04:25:39
Got my Slush beta discount today and ordered.
0.22766600 BTC
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:13:21
Like stocks?
@_date: 2014-09-21 04:51:38
$19 yr node
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:49:59
Looks nice.. I'll probably buy one. Get my wife to measure my noggin. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:15:54
As quickly as I hit buy on Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-06-07 03:19:13
I'm selling a silver mine for Litecoin if interested.
@_date: 2014-08-20 01:16:49
Nice.. thanks for posting
@_date: 2014-12-27 07:26:37
I did it too damnit.
Total: $256.37
Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2014-10-01 20:05:41
This is good. I have a few full nodes with them. Running  P2pool there too.
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:03:12
Then try my 0% Fee P2pool. Throw some GH/s over here. Need to test it some more. Yesterday was a good day. Three blocks. Someone point some power there for a few. I'm adding another Ant s1 tomorrow.
Server is in Atlanta, GA
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:25:50
I'm Jelly
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:37:09
 - My server is hosted in Atlanta, GA. 
Join the fun. 0% Fee p2pool node.
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:08:19
Funny..three of these have been on my BTC shopping radar for a few months. Can I get all these @ Newegg or Overstock? 
Phantom for BTC where?, GoPro Hero 4 and PS4. That last newegg BTC deal was nice. I should have pulled the trigger. I think I'm waiting for a even better holiday deals. 
List is legit.

@_date: 2017-02-23 22:45:08
Actually it has been much better for me. After the Finex debacle I stopped trading and it has been great. Been holding since before last ATH.
@_date: 2017-02-06 00:54:20
I have used Keyscrambler for several years and have had no issues. 
I would still recommend a hardware wallet. Currently using a Trezor.
@_date: 2014-09-04 00:10:16
I'm waiting on my invite. I currently use instant buy on Coinbase with CC backup. I think it's like 1K a day instant buy limit from bank account. There is a bank fee with instant buy on Coinbase. I'm assuming CC advance would be much higher.
Are you using the CC because you didn't want to wait or just didn't want to link a bank account? I'm trying to get a handle on the fees. I don't want any CC cash advance fees. Just trying to understand. 
I'm not even sure you can buy on Coinbase with CC. I was thinking it was just a backup and it would be a cash advance instead of a regular CC charge if the bank draft failed. Maybe that's the difference. I need to read up.
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:46:06
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:55:55
I love my Trezor. No complaints.
@_date: 2016-03-13 00:14:15
Just bought The Division with BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:01:47
Waiting for verification for weeks now.
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:18:23
Anyone serious will probably tell you:
many nodes.. much storage. Been there done that.
@_date: 2017-03-28 00:22:24
Ahh the good old days. Jan, 14 I bought my first ASIC miners. I think it was around .54 for each. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:23:48
Not on Bitfinex
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:46:29
An exchange issue is now a technical correction. Well gosh damn. Safe Haven
@_date: 2017-01-21 02:31:27
It happened long time ago. On newegg.
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:08:11
Trezor or another hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:50:52
Updated.. no issues.
@_date: 2017-01-28 07:18:35
Deutsche Bank does not agree

Basically every transaction is a taxable event in the United States.
I'm looking because I'm going to need it.

Have not used them since the hack. No loss here.
@_date: 2016-11-11 14:40:42
Yes.. Trezor seeds two different houses and safe deposit box.
@_date: 2016-11-08 04:20:51
Good quality hats here.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:48:10
Yeah..I was excited when it hit $10.
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:39:46
Electrum+Trezor = piece of mind
Hosting = no piece of mind
@_date: 2016-02-22 20:03:59
Finally.. hell why not try it out. I'm down.
@_date: 2016-02-13 17:28:41
me.. pretty often too
@_date: 2016-02-19 21:59:55
Hah love it

This NOW. What that person said. The peace of mind is valuable.
@_date: 2016-02-18 00:17:35
Welcome to the crazy train. The engineer is high as fuck.
@_date: 2016-02-19 21:48:34
I have only used instant buy and exchange. Most is immediately moved out to Trezor. Some stays on exchange. Never had any issues.
@_date: 2017-04-27 00:28:52
Yes.. 
I never exposed mine externally and anyone using an Antminer can surely edit a host file. lol. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:24:56
So he is saying you should already have a Trezor and it's all your fault.
@_date: 2016-02-07 15:24:11
Just turned mine off for first time in years.
@_date: 2016-02-19 03:56:15
Coinbase + CB Exchange and Circle good place to start. Anyone mention those?
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:56:35
A taxable event in the United States.
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:26:17
GTFO John
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:23:04
Correct.. price increase. All those tiny ass mining rewards from 2 years ago totally worth it now. That is what I was banking on. Even as intermediate ROI was decreasing rapidly at the time. I was not planning on selling the mined coins though. I didn't care about short term gains.

Been looking for a BTC discount for a Phantom. 
Thanks for the info
@_date: 2016-10-14 15:52:58
That is pretty fucking dumb. Did that help?
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:53:19
BTC for depreciating asset ;(
I thought about a new S4 then I laughed. Paid off Subaru STi for years and it holds value like a boss. Fuck debt.
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:39:56
60 coins and asking about liquidity. You have to be kidding or full of shit. Is 2+ billion $ in 24 hrs enough for you?
@_date: 2016-05-20 03:07:52
Received this today too. No click and then I winked at my Trezor.
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:08:33
Did you mine coin back in 2013?
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:59:53
Are you in or out Mr 185 bid? Damn flasher
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:31:28
O and thanks for the cheap coins.
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:43:55
3 hours so far Coinbase out transfer. Yes and Trezor will kill you setting high fee right now.
@_date: 2015-03-14 00:26:26
Guess I'll find out
@_date: 2015-10-19 19:39:45
