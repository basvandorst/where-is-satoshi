This is how my family treated it.
$100.. wasting my time
$1000.. Wasting my life
$3000.. Out of my god damned mind
$5000.. everyone is out of their god damned mind
$10,000.. silence.
And here we are today.

That's literally forever ago in Crypto terms.

Really old. The price was $5000 when this was shot.

Digital Currency
All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.
The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft.
Coinbase holds less than 2% of customer funds online. The rest is held in offline storage.
This insurance policy does not cover any losses resulting from the compromise of your individual Coinbase account. It is your responsibility to use a strong password and maintain control of all login credentials you use to access Coinbase and GDAX.
Tl;dr: Safer then most...but not as safe as in your own hands. Having control of your own private key is better in almost every situation.

Can I be the real bitcoin now?
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:45:38
Why though? Those guys are a doomsday cult.

Atomic swaps should help with things like this.

Oh my god you are a genius. Take all my money.

Do you guys ever feel guilty helping pump and dumpers? Even if we're knowledgeable with what's happening? I hate myself every time I buy these rallies, but...ugh I can't help it.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:49:20
Yeah but we're scalping retards. It just doesn't sit well with me. It's not like I'm taking dollars right out of Roger Vers lying mouth.

 &gt; GPU/CPU mining isn't worth it at all.
That's not true at all.

It kinda reminds me of people freaking out over that Kony2012 stuff. Just absolutely hyped out of nowhere. With randomly passionate activists popping up and putting up posters.
Meanwhile the rest of us are like: "Wut?"
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:51:21
Why even make a transparent bot army like that? I'm sure we all can't read the redditor for 3 days part.

Who wants to make Bitcoin Copper with me? Or wait wait..no.
How about we fork it, and half the block size instead, then call it Bitcoin Mini!
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:03:16
I love you guys. Don't ever change. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:41:54
The genie is out of the bottle now. This could be bigger then the ICO phase. 1 coin did this and survived, now there's going to be forks, and forks of forks.
Tons of people are gonna wanna get in on this racket.

Throwing it on Bitcoin would be a waste of your time.
Throwing it on something else to then throw on Bitcoin however.

Who cares about the pump and dump playground?
