when i buy big amount OTC for a bargain and pump them onto the open market?
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:47:14
i grabbed off my crypto gains, i was the die-hard hodler since 2011.
first the dream was becoming so wealthy to not work anything i do not like.
now the new challenge:
how to spend these gains on the "real market" to create a foundation for my kids?  
is it a good idea to buy some appartements from insolvencies and fix them up and rent out?  
what would you guys do with a few hundred grands extra cash, except buying crypto ofcourse.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:45:22
well still the mempool lets see that many people move coins. where do they move the coins? to starbucks or overstock? they move to exchanges to quickly sell and sidestep the inevitable.

i am in tears leaving my beloved bitcoin. but i have to save my own skin before the ideal.

i heard satoshi is gonna dump his 1 million coins tomorrow. he needs some $ to buy winter tyres.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:30:10
i will definitely buy on 1st. i dont care what happens.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:30:16
im a stubborn idiot. i thought it might bounce back down a bit but keep a good value in the long run. i really believed in last years crypto rise and thought it reaches a mass adoption and a kinda-stable price region.
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:20:28
i thought the same.
so i cashed out while still in the green. i do not see the USD die in the near future, but the BTC is to volatile.
so i go to the USD side and wait it out.
if it goes lower i can still buy back bitcoin and have more bitcoins than before.

on some days it often feels like we are just some dozen people in the whole crypto space.

it was people hodling since 2011, 2012...
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:36:42
imagine stocking up in 2015 with $20k... 
suddenly its a million, suddenly its half a million, suddenly its a quarter million...
wouldnt you get out then??? you are still up 10x and say fuck it now.

@_date: 2018-11-26 12:52:51
you suffer in the bear market? your nerves cant hold it?
sell your stash and come to the other side.
simple solution. did it for me.
better out with 10x than hoping for 20x and out with zero.
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:17:52
theres a lot of thought going through my head and i somehow want to scream it out to you guys and get some feedback.
as posted earlier, sometimes crypto space feels like we are only a dozen people.

everyone i know ran away.
only 1 guy who had gambling issues in the past is talking about "bull run" and "soon fomo".

looks like you talk about me. but i am no anti-coiner or nocoiner troll. i am a long term hodler who is realizing that we approach a death-spiral.
what happend last year upwards happens this year downwards.
if you cant stand some realistic opinions and only want people preach "HODL", then this subreddit is pointless.
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:49:39

i did not hear of any suicides or other homelessness stories.
so obviously there is not enough blood on the street to buy.

lots of small TX will go over lightning and only bigger settlement payments go over the blockchain. mid term suggestion is to do small things in lightning, bigger payments will be onchain. but most of the mining payout is blockreward, which is there whatever much payments happen on chain

i heard he already bought a spare dick in the darknet
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:06:34
see, in the gox times my stash was worth $20k, in the 13-15 time it was worth maybe $60k
but last boom it was worth almost 2mil and now its worth $400k
this is money i can never earn in my country.
so i better be a "400k-guy" than a "i-couldve-had-2mil-guy"
this money buys me a house and feeds me for life. so i say FUCK IT
and with the new peace of mind i maybe find the inspiration for some new business which then maybe EARNs me a milllion ;)

i mean really, fuck it.
i was hodling since 2011, never touched my coins, always stocked up every month. lived like a monk and put every cent into btc.
i could have gone out last week and it would have been almost a million dollar.
but at the moment i could be back to a shit job in a day. so fuck it.
so i better have some 400k in hands than the hope for a big bounce back up.
maybe i am an idiot right now. but better the small bird in hands
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:15:00
yeah, i am greedy for USD while others are fearful not selling their BTC.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:22:05
the manipulation is obvious. they hammer down BTC each day 10%.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:48:34
i thought "crazy, i should get out" but i am a btc believer since day 1 so i stayed in.
i thought, well, let it go back a bit, or whatever, but now comes mass-adoption.
at least i felt my investment is kinda safe, but now that it nears a 10-fold decrease, i have to pull the trigger.  
one cant be in bitcoin for 8 years and get out with a total loss.  
this way i am around x8 of what i put in, so i should  be mega happy :) :)
but whenever i put my hands on trading with little amounts, i always traded in the wrong moment. maybe this time too... but as said, i dont wanna risk it any longer. my pain barrier was reached below 4k. fuck it

@_date: 2018-11-20 10:51:24
to me it seems everyone wants to get out, 
institutions buy up all the panic coins,
next year all the ETFs come out and the institutions get rich. and the hardcore hodlers.
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:38:56
all sound what you say... but to be honest the last years pump was only dumb money.
all the gambler types in my town suddenly approached me in autumn 2017 "you know that ICO" "you also in crypto"
everyone and their dog was suddenly a crypto-specialist in mid-late 2017...
now these people all still do their shit jobs and are worried about their 2 month-wages they put in.

my agenda really is bitcoin. believer since it first popped up on slashdot.
but our dream back then of a slowly growing steady coin economy is scattered.
its now a volatile daytraders paradise
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:00:55
sorry to spread some realism here.
i was in crypto when you were still thinking you could get rich making a blog with google adsense.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:52:20
not sure. maybe 1000 a month since 2012 regularly. i never really tracked it. just put it all into my one btc hodl address and it felt great when looking at the blockexplorer.
having my little secret rich stash and people around me thinking what poor idiot i am :)
also the hard recession years i was staying cool. but now it is a level, i do not want to loose my initial investments so i better get out with the smaller gain than risk it, just to maybe touch the millionaire spheres again.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:58:45
you dont have to. i dont care. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:05:40
its boring. its crazy to watch with BTC in a locktime-address. 
but a paralyzed man can also survive a tsunami.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:49:32
bitcoin wont die! but it will find its place after this overvaluation.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:35:30
seems like big otc trades make the big quick swings. boom 10% gone within 20 minutes...
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:01:09
thanks for the wishes! thats what i thought. better get out with a nice gain, than waiting for the next hype which might never come.
now i take my free time and work on something which might become good :)
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:10:48
why was it FUD? since my post btc tanked from 3780 to 3580. i should start shorting.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:44:18
why you go OTC? privacy, direct cash payment, big sums between big players
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:00:02
you said the same in 2015
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:56:58
man, its mostly a psychological lesson. training to balls of steel. i have some in a nlocktime address locked until 2025. imagine
@_date: 2018-11-22 12:31:26
assume all monero is darknet, then darknet is about 1% of total crypto
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:11:45
i freelanced on bitcointalk forums. i brought traffic to some affiliate stuff and got paid in btc.
overall a nice trip. all in all i maybe put $70k into crypto so to speak. at peak it was worth almost 2 millions, and really believed it might keep at least half that value so i was staying in.
but the current trend had me realize my gains and say goodbye.
i am still within the goal of my dream, that i do not have to work a 9to5 for the rest of my life. i dont need a lambo, a VW is good for me.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:40:14
this crypto crash is just a warmup for the upcoming $/€ crash. crypto will be worth a lot then.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:39:31
i am sick of this western world consumerism hunt for the money all live long. i take my 400k and move into the woods. i am fed up with everything.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:01:57
the risk to loose it all is imminent. this time many people REALLY panic. this time people are in it with their live savings. in 2015 it was mostly real traders and gamblers. but this time the panic sell can reach much deeper lows.
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:36:28
"hash war", early hodlers realizing gains and quitting the market. reverse fomo
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:02:18
to be honest, i felt really strange through last years boom.
this year i sold my coin early enough and now make party with a light heart.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:28:23
fuck it, i am out for now.
cashing out now, i can live my whole modestly off it.
at one point it was over a million dollar and i just stayed cool and just HODLed. but now it's "live off it or go to a shit job again".
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:28:53

come to an end guys. it is getting boring. same boring as last years mega-rise. i just want a slow steady climb. nothing more.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:00:25
i have a steady income in bitcoin. so i might stock up a new stash month by month. we'll see.
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:52:11
not everyone is selling. for every seller there is a buyer. big money uses the hash-war confusion to stock up on bitcoins. the 21million club gets a whole new meaning in the long run.
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:43:34
public opinion of bitcoin is very bad. i do not see new dumb money coming in any time soon.
many mom&amp;pop got burned and this talk is making the rounds.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:04:57
and these people already were the "critical mass".
they got burned. no more new dumb-money-sheeps around.
and those hoping for BAKKT ETF ... the people putting money there have a bit more brains than last years mom&amp;pop investors which drove the market.
get off your illussions.
sell this garbage and wait it out. its just a button press in case the FOMO train rolls.
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:55:55
how cheesy is it all? exactly at the BLACK FRIDAY worldwide consumerism hype all the coins crash down. last year it reaches ATH at christmas and now the year-low at BLACK FRIDAY.
whats in it this christmas?
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:59:42
okay officer.
@_date: 2018-11-18 11:01:08
optimistic outlook:  BTC levelled out at \~6K.  
the hash war took \~10% of hashrate from BTC to BCH, so it took some of the price.
BCH will finish itself, bitcoin will slowly get more adaption, more usage.
HODL  
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:09:48
but why would you think it would be easier to hodl this time? this time it is a live saving i am risking, the other 2 times it was not so much.
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:51:28
its weekend. can we expect a massive selloff tomorrow? traders who rest on weekends selling fomo?
