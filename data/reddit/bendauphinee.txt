I use coinbase to buy, because there are few options other than local cash here. I _have_ to overpay for fees even when using my segwit wallet for other purchases. It's not that I _choose_ to overpay. I hate that it's to the point that a transaction costs me over $15 to clear in a reasonable time.

Don't carry a lot more than your current transaction on you.
Do meet in a public place, with Wifi, or make sure you both have data access.
Don't talk about how much BTC you have overall.
I'm Canadian, so I don't assume evil intentions, but that large of an amount might change things.
I would think that you'd want to watch the amount of money you're transferring in person. I bet $20k transfers carry some sort of implication in current law, especially when you go to dump it in your bank account (if you do). You may even be subject to VAT, or some sort of capital gains tax, or income tax.

Are you an American?
Yes, I don't always like how my Canadian govt uses my tax money, but I can also walk into an ER and leave without a bill. I have roads that I can drive on, and they get cleared of snow in a (mostly) timely matter. There are social programs that I or others in desperate need can fall back on (usually).
I pay something close to 30% in taxes, and it is a _lot_ of money. Would I like it to be less, sure. But, I work and pay taxes because there is a system out there that I agreed to be a part of, that makes sure my day to day life outside my house is somewhat agreeable.
There is no threat of violence. Worst case, I stop paying taxes, they put a lein on the property I own. I could still walk into an ER, and walk out without a bill. I still walk free, without the threat of violence from roaming gangs. I still get my house fire put out.
