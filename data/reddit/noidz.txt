I thought about this today.. Knowing banks and government and such, they probably do the "bitcoin tax" first, but then you can legitimate say: Well, I didn't but that, I bought [any other coin]. They can't trace it. Sure you then have some kind of payment to you for the trouble so you can buy "any other coin" again. I think it's almost faster than bitcoin.

Honestly that's a "bubble-graph". Pick a low and a high point, squeeze it real tight to show the maximum amount of impact. You can do that with 0.01 to 0.05 if one likes to do that. It's real easy to frame stuff in a bad (or good) way like this.

I can't image how hard and fast the words "oh fuck" come to mind in such a situation.. I feel sorry for him..

I bought via Litebit.eu, but I bought there before. I received my coins though. Could it be someone else is sending me coins? That would be possible though.
Edit: And if so.. it's from EU to BTC. Does that needs to be confirmed? Got like 8 mails since the last transaction.

I first bought in at 3700, sold at 3000, bought back in at 3500, sold at 5500, bought in when I heard the X2 was suspended. I lost alot in BTC down the way, but got some gain anyway. 
I wanted to wait this time for it to drop massively to buy a whole coin. Don't think that time will come soon now, but now I kinda trust BTC which I didn't before. I think this is really, really good! I think it became more stable after this announcement.
