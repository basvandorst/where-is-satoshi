Thanks for the help.  My wallet allows me to spend unconfirmed funds.  I had close to zero in the wallet prior to receiving this transaction.  If I simply spend an amount greater than what I originally had, will this then force the coin I received to be "melted" and therefore accomplish my goal?

The issue I have is that I'm using a wallet where I can't manually enter the fee.  So for one transaction I transferred from this wallet to another one I have where I can manually enter the fee - then I sent another transaction with a $10 fee from that wallet.....since that one will need the original to be confirmed.

So does that mean that what I just did was pointless?

Can you please explain how this process works? 36 hours now and it's still unconfirmed :(

Thanks for the reply.  By that do you mean the volume of transactions and the fees others have paid?  Is there anything I can do as the receiver to speed it up?

How long is too long though? It's been over 24 hours now....

Why would I be BSing?  What exactly would I gain from that.  It's easy to see there are tons of transactions where abnormally low fees were used and thus they aren't confirming.  Thus it's easy to see why people such as myself would seek help.

Thanks again.  Is there anyway to alert a miner who has the patch about these transactions?
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:56:59
  is the transaction.  Apologies as I'm still somewhat of a bitcoin newbie, so I'm not sure what you mean by which output is mine.  1NKmmsUs7qn8eBYFo13nN2C87QwJGZBhiB is the address I control.

Wow, thanks very much for your detailed response.  
Unfortunately in the interim I asked in another thread how CPFP works and was told I simply had to spend a portion of the unconfirmed coins.  So I have sent a few transactions from that same wallet with elevated transaction fees, including one with a obscenely high fee compared to normal.  It was explained in the other thread that miners will want to get the higher fees but need to confirm the original tx first.  Is this strategy not sound?

Is it as simple as that?  If I simply send a transaction from the wallet where the unconfirmed transaction is sitting into a different wallet of mine, include a large fee, this should do the trick?

How do I do this?  Is there a way to contact miners and even offer a direct payment for mining a certain block?
