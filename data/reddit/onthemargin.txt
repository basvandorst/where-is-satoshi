"Bitcoin news websites to expose those that accept paid-for articles on bitcoin products and services"
Am I missing something, or is this not just blatantly obvious? I've sent out a couple press releases on stuff I've done in the Cryptocurrency community to a few of these sites, and I overwhelmingly got responses back that consisted of "Send us an article plus one bitcoin and we'll publish it for X days."

The network effect varies greatly based on game type and offering.
There are some interesting strategies a brand new poker room could take to try to bootstrap liquidity to a level that will satisfy a decent percentage of incoming recreational players.
My impression is that none of the smaller poker rooms have thought through those options though.

Yeah, this is a pretty poor choice of headlines. The officials involved understand they can't actually control the digital currencies themselves.
I've been tangentially involved in the growing Bitcoin scene on the island, and in my opinion the government has been (at least paying lip service toward) doing a shockingly good job at walking the line between being as hands off as possible to make sure innovation flourishes while trying to set up a framework to make sure banks are willing to work with Bitcoin companies and customers are protected.

*"It sounds dangerous to me to assume that attackers are motivated by being economically rational. There are people in this world whose objective is to destroy, and they don't care about whether it's economically rational or not."*
It may sound dangerous when you word it like that, but it's what we do in our normal lives in almost 100% of instances.
It's economically rational to not go into a grocery store and inject poison into random foodstuffs, which is why (despite the urban legends) nobody does it.
It's economically rational to not murder someone, and it has historically gotten more irrational to murder someone as society and technology have progressed, which is why we see dropping murder rates in most of the world as time goes on.
Just because there's "nothing" keeping someone from accosting you in the street and stabbing you to death other than economic incentives (in the form of laws, police, vigilante justice, whatever), that doesn't mean you should be scared to run your errands. In fact, we depend on people to be economically rational in thousands of instances everyday for everything from not getting murdered to making sure you can get a decent cup of coffee.
This especially holds when the prerequisite to being able to be economically *irrational* is to be economically rational long enough to accumulate this great amount of money only to then suddenly turn irrational and burn it all away to spite Bitcoin.
Now, there are some entities (governments) for whom it's been speculated it might be rational for them to waste this money on an attack on the Bitcoin network, but that's an entirely different story where you're still relying on them to act within their economic incentives.

I don't have a problem with miners earning, and I think it makes a lot of sense given Proof of Work is the best way we've come up with achieving a decentralized consensus so far.
However, I do think a lot of the discussion surrounding different mining algorithms is overblown, and it's a little disgusting to see incorrect claims being made that prey on people who don't understand how cryptography works.


I think there's a small chance it (or an offshoot) overcomes Bitcoin, which is the only reason it's worth putting effort into (as per the thesis of the article).
While the exact plans for the proceeds of the presale aren't finalized yet, as I'm concentrating on the technology for now, it will be used to fund a development team to build on top of the Credits protocol.

No, my point was 100% with the fact that people who are economically motivated to do an action can usually be counted on to do that action.
The "exceptions" to this rule generally happen when someone misunderstands the economic pressures put upon an individual or group.
Hence: "Now, there are some entities (governments) for whom it's been speculated it might be rational for them to waste this money on an attack on the Bitcoin network, but that's an entirely different story where you're still relying on them to act within their economic incentives."

Ben Lawsky and the legislators are claiming this legislation will not negatively impact businesses and jobs being created in NY, and that's one of the major reasons they're able to get away with it.

It wasn't just the price decrease though.
Most of the people I talked to about Bitcoin at the time were still profitable, having gotten in between $0.25 and $1.
It seemed like a legitimate existential crisis for the technology itself. You really needed to have incredibly strong convictions to still believe in the technology at that time.
There were only a few thousand of us at the time, and most of that number were disillusioned due to the price crash.

You're misunderstanding my criticism of your post.
* PokerStars is not entering the US market again, except under a state-by-state regulatory framework that explicitly gives them a license to operate. Black Friday changed a lot, and a lot has changed even further since then.
* To dip their toes in the Bitcoin water, PokerStars absolutely would use a third party vendor. This is for a variety of reasons.
* PokerStars is not building an internal (or external) Bitcoin exchange. My bet is they'd either take it as an additional payment method using an existing third-party service (and I bet I know which one is in the lead) or build a new brand that's Bitcoin-only.

This is true.
The way poker and gambling sites were pro(per)secuted over the past decade is pretty shameful.
Almost none of it was through anything resembling a democratic process, and it was all accomplished through money-laundering-esque laws/guidelines and scaremongering to banks, rather than by actually passing laws against the core activity.
Not that I think passing laws against online gambling are something that should be done, but at least you'd have the pretense that it was something other than resume building for DOJ employees.

I think it's moving closer to a world where employers and employees generally transact as equals, removing much of the leverage employers have over poorer employees today.

Aside from that, (even though it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things) I'd also be interested to know if soccer/football is getting more violent each year or less violent; because if it's a downward trend, it reinforces my point even more, rather than contradicts it.
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:09:24
I wholeheartedly agree.
It was a much smaller, much more fragile community, and the little media coverage Bitcoin received at the time was very much negative, gloating at best.
It's a good point that it was the first time after it reached $1-parity, because I remember thinking even for months after the crash that $2 to $4 seemed really expensive and risky. In a lot of ways, it was a riskier investment at $2 than it is now at $500 or it was in December at $1,000.

I'll take a look though, and hope I'm wrong and there is useful insight there.
@_date: 2014-08-15 00:54:30
You're completely misunderstanding my point.
Of course when an asset has less risk, it also has less upside.
When Bitcoin was at $2, it was facing severe existential crises every day.
Today, it's more or less a safe bet that Bitcoin will be a part of the internet zeitgeist going forward, and there is a ton of institutional money and momentum behind it, both as a technology and a currency.
While it's not the most likely thing that Bitcoin will 100x or 512x again in the next year or two, it's also much less likely that it just fades into oblivion, which had much more of a chance of happening three years ago.
It was more than possible that if just two or three additional people in 2010 were discouraged from continuing work on Bitcoin, it would have failed. Today, that is an almost insignificant concern.
I think you really misunderstand either my point or the atmosphere that surrounded Bitcoin at the time to disagree that Bitcoin was more fragile in 2011 than it is today.
For the record, I do think it's more likely today that Bitcoin goes from $512 to $131,072 than it was likely that Bitcoin went from $2 in 2011 to $512 today.
