That quote is actually fully compatible with Sagan &amp; Druyan’s quote above, as it clearly advocates intolerance against the intolerants in just one case, *actual violence*, when the intolerants “answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols”. 
Of course that is right, as Gab surely agrees (as well as the Bill of Rights), but it has nothing to do with free speech at all. About free speech, Popper has it that “as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, *suppression would certainly be unwise*...”
