I'm curious, what is a Bonobo Git Server?

You'd think our government would be fine with it... Until you exchange it for USD or buy goods domestically, just for tax reasons. It can't be that hard to apply the regular sales tax to it, can it?

Damn. It takes 2 days to verify a credit card with you guys too? :( I'm just going to use PayPal to pay this invoice and forget about using BitCoin then. Seems like too many hoops to jump through for something I barely know anything about.
I appreciate the time you took in responding to me.

Man! Circle.com was so much smoother/faster then Coinbase! Thank you!
:O Thanks for the Bits! You did not have to do that! 
Man you and made me smile today. 
Unfortunately Circle also requires a 3-5 day wait too! 


I guess I'll have to be patient and wait a week! Thanks for the start! 
Edit: I'll wait a few days! Much faster then the 7 days required by Coinbase! Thanks!

Checking out snapcard.io! That is one clean website! 
@_date: 2015-09-07 20:59:20
Thank you! I understand, it's just hard to believe in this day and age there's still a 7 day wait time on instant gratification.

Man! ChangeTip looks super clean and easy to use! 
@_date: 2015-09-07 20:59:35
Thank you! I'm going to try and figure it out. Every time I click buy it redirects me to my bank thing. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 00:21:54
Thanks Perhaps I should just verify a few and be patient. What's the tip for? I'm not used to getting tipped!
@_date: 2015-09-07 21:30:34
Thanks! I'll check them out.
I just paid my invoice for that service in PayPal. I'll research bitcoin more later :) Thanks 1776m8!
