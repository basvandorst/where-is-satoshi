Show me the money �� ��

Makes sense, thanks. Waiting to by back in but waiting to see how long this dip lasts. Any thoughts on that besides buy now?

I sold like two days ago and still haven’t been able to transfer that money out to my bank yet so I’m not sure. That’s the other thing. I have money that I could buy BC right now with, but ideally I wanted to just just cash out that BC and immediately replace it in my wallet

Lol I knew I would get replies like these. For everyone’s sake I hope it continues to raise but I think I’ll wait for a dip.

Thank you, appreciate the advice

It also went from $19k to 3k. Dips are subjective.

I had to sell because I wanted to keep it in a wallet and I had bought this amount through Robinhood and couldn’t transfer, so waiting to buy back in. Hoping to buy this next round and hold.

Had to sell as I wanted to have my BC in a wallet but I had bought through Robinhood. Made $5, now waiting to buy back in. Any thoughts of suggestions on when to rebuy?

Yeah, there’s a chance of that. There’s also a more likely chance it drops down a few thousand again like it has multiple times.

I don’t know much BTC terminology, what’s halvening mean in this context?
