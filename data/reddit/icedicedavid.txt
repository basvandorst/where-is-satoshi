Not at this time sorry, that way it's fair for people to only redeem once. Even with twitter account restriction, many people took advantages and created blank twitter accounts to get this deal many times over. So I had to put on a minimum requirement of 10 followers.

The problem with just-dice is their maximum profit is too high. you can win 500btc in 1 bet if you have enough bank roll. This is risky as 4 wins in a row would mean a loss of 2000btc for the bank. 
Shameless plug here, for those of you want to invest in a safer alternative. checkout my new dice site:  We have lower maximum profit to reduce variance. And being lower profile with small bankroll means your investment would be safer.

2FA is in the works. the authorized url is needed to "install to home screen" for iPhones. I will add a feature to disable it if it's not needed.

I totally agree with you. Anything bitcoin investment is risky, even holding on to bitcoin itself is risky. 
I do have reputation with my real identity online, but then I'm afraid it would be too easy to find me in real life. I don't want to attract robbery to my house who would steal my computers in hopes to find the private key to my bitcoin wallet. There is already cases where members on bitcointalk.org had their house broken into just to steal their avalon asic. People would do anything for bitcoins these days. 
I think it's also safer for investors if I'm not easily tracked down. As for me stealing the coins, I don't think it would be wise as all the coins could be traced in the network and it would be hard to spend it on anything tangible without being caught.

Reputation is earned. Only time will till how trust worthy I am. I'm not valuing my site at $7Million for an IPO and offering 10% instant rebate on investments (cough letsdice cough) to bait investors. A small bankroll means larger cut for investors, plus less risk too. I'm not a bitcoin millionaire so I can't afford to pump the bankroll like some of the other sites. Indeed just-dice is very good. I only made ice-dice because when I tried to play just-dice on my mobile, well I couldn't...

It is definitely in my best interest to run this business properly as the bitcoin community is not people I want to mess with! 
PS. I cancelled my Google interview so I can dedicate full-time to this project.

Hey thanks for the reply, sorry I didn't notice this just now until someone told me you replied here on bitcointalk. The problematic clicks weren't from the banners I purchased. As I said in the original post, the problem ads were purchased by one of our investor, and it was text ads linked to his referral url.

Riplin is over complicating it for you. 
Just integrate the blockchain wallet api.
It's the easiest way to get going.
