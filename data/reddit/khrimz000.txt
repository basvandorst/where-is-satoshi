my apologies for not sucking the xrp cock...you sound like every other crypto out there..like electroneum...
@_date: 2019-11-16 18:10:35
Always good to see.
Slowly but surely...its happening.
@_date: 2019-11-16 00:56:48
wait..so you won the internet?
you won on an ANONYMOUS forum?
lol...dude..your pettiness knows know bounds.
And still...
 Bitcoin 	$153,240,504,811 	$8,489.93 	$21,831,332,126 	
 XRP XRP 	$11,312,870,569 	$0.261276 	$1,550,416,062 	
Have you ever seen 5 bucks?
@_date: 2019-11-10 22:15:36
Its funny cuz im doing this in reverse. Never invested in anything. Found bitcoin years ago and ignored it. Found it again a few years later and whats like, "WTF have i done?!?!" then bought.
  
NOW...im actually going to buy gold Oz coins now....juuuuuuust in case.
@_date: 2019-11-26 01:59:51
Wait..how so?
Because BTC was at  $6,558.14 a day or so ago and now its up 4.21% at $7,196.37 in less than 24 hours.
Thats quite remarkable...i mean..almost a 600 bounce back?
I dunno man....
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:23:46
NO WAY! 
NO FREAKIN WAY!  
I thought money laundering started with the EEEEEVUUUUUUULLL BITCOIN, about 10 years ago!
@_date: 2019-11-12 23:05:04
Yeah, theres decentralization, futures, Baakt, Grayscales  is creating bitcoin related products, bitcoin IRAs but, then when we look here:
BTC $8,799.74 &gt; Ripple $0.272077
@_date: 2019-11-11 22:22:52
Even after all of that:
BTC  = $8,766.66
Ripple = 	$0.276031
You probably think the earth is flat too, huh?
Youre like the Kellyanne Conway of crypto....luuvs to try and spin shit...
@_date: 2019-11-15 01:37:28
Then we see the numbers again:
Bitcoin 		$8,682.59 	
XRP 	$0.268221 	
One question...what does 4 dollars look like?
BTW, Bitcoin mentioned by name and advertised specifically:
And again:
The first was shown specifically on national tv.
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:10:58
id just laugh at the xrp guys lol..but if btc were that low...id be buying the shit out of BTC .
@_date: 2019-11-11 21:43:19


This, among other arguments have been said for as long as every single new crypto that comes out against bitcoin.
(  )
So ive heard it all before.
All markets..ALL of them are and have been manipulated..even traditional ones so thats never every really going to be any rebuttal or exude/reasoning in the least. I wish people would stop using that as one. 
Bitcoin is not like NEO or any other crypto as NEO skyrocketed to an (xrp never before seen) 190 bucks and NEO GAS was..but even I know that BTC will still be on top so i traded near the top for more BTC and it was a very wise move. 
There are no "XRP" futures, or "XRP" Baakt....or XRP Retirements out there at all.
BTW, with your example, it looks like you grossly oversimplified it.
I could do the same too...BTC has 21 million in existence..its actually more like 18/17 mill because of how many were lost over the yearsand ripple has 99,991,298,961.
Basic math..supply and demand. One is older, has been around and incredibly more rare than the abundant xrp. 
I mean..if were going to oversimplify things....
And no, its not just about the price, but its worth a shit ton more than ripple. Period. Also look at how long ripple has been out vs BTC vs ETH and its STILL sub 1 buck...peaking at a little over 3 bucks?
Ripple is the "pennies" of the crypto space.
lol @ me looking bad.....and xrp wit their "partnerships"...funny as BTC didnt need any of those and look at where its at today...
@_date: 2019-11-14 03:25:48
No strawman.
BTC &gt; XRP
It REALLY irritates you to see people say that...doesnt it?
Yeah NOT misguided.
Grayscales primary selling point, up front, is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-10 22:09:39
lol yup..so true.  
Some people are just blind haters
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:25:35
Bitcoin is a scam.
Bitcoin isnt going anywhere.
Bitcoin is going to zero.
Ripple is going to surpass bitcoin.
Bitcoin is dead.
...and all the other stuff weve heard over and over and over.....over the years.
@_date: 2019-11-20 23:27:20
They have to actually PAY the banks if they dont have enough $$ in their account?
Is that correct?
@_date: 2019-11-15 22:48:08
Youre like a bum with a cardboard shack for a house trying to convince a man in a mansion that the shack is better than the mansion lol.
@_date: 2019-11-03 04:19:15
I know elastos had something like that going on.
They had a chat feature.
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:54:31
Interesting...join the fray and "school" those guys lol talking about xrp.
@_date: 2019-11-13 17:08:55
Yeah..and I pretty much disagree, as posted.
Hey..maybe youre the type to put your life savings into one crypto...XRP...no way in hell Id do that. 
But thats you.
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2019-11-13 02:51:55
And Trump supporters believe hes never told a lie....
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:46:16
Bottom line = BTC &gt; Ripple
BTW, No change of subject, its an analogy, dumbass lol.
And yet still:
Bitcoin  $8,752.90 	
Ripple   $0.272066
@_date: 2019-11-11 18:58:08
and when the dust settles:
XRP           $0.27  (Born 2013 coutnless partnerships)
Bitcoin	$8,795.02 (Born 2009 - No partnerships)
Ethereum 	$186.51 (Born 2015 - Basis for many altocoins)
So, when i read what you post, i really dont care about XRPs performance.
Overall, it has been terrible.
This crypto has NEVER hit 4 dollars despite how long it has been around.
But..i think ripple is the "penny" of the crypto space. Theres a ton of it, and its cheap.
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:09:57
This ALWAYS happens when i dont have alot of $$$
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:20:44
Its not that high anymore so get busy!
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:27:21
You know its funny...i tested it out by putting like 15 bucks in it a year or so ago...maybe more..then i was looking at it and put in another 20.....ive got i think 80 now but its so random and its crazy how it adds up. I usually forget about my cash app and use Coinbase auto deposit and my ledger for long term.
I dont think people realize just how fast stuff adds up.
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:33:20
Look at NEO. I got in at 24, 40 and held. Went up to 190.
AND i bought GAS.
I was completely blown away when the ATH hits.  
Couldnt believe what i was seeing. But all those bitches into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:51:23
Cant stop decentralization tho....certain nuances with crypto and freedoms (if youre in the usa) that killing the use of bitcoin is against some rights.
@_date: 2019-10-11 04:10:32
This i dope as hell!
Someone should make a shirt with bitcoin and this!
@_date: 2019-10-11 04:09:36
Im pretty much never cashing out..i may put it into  USDC to hold its value if i can see a massive dip, but cashing out?  
Hell no.
@_date: 2019-10-03 02:43:38
Bitcoin wont do it. The govt will do that to themselves.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:58:23
This administration is...probably the most ignorant that i think the USA and the world have ever seen, but i dont think its simply this administration.  
I think all prior would be that way.
Change is slowly coming tho....Andrew Yang is probably going to fall on his face, but weve never seen anyone speak so highly of crypto that is running for president.
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:19:00
Also..if you have coinbase, auto deposit. Man..its great.  
U can start out 30 bucks every pay day (if its twice a week) and its automatic.  
And, if you see a major dip, buy more at that time too.
It will add up quick.
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:11:16
Start with 100 bucks. Period.  
But you HAVE to start now. 
Next month. 100 bucks.
Got an extra 20 bucks to spare?
Use it too.
You have to start somewhere and work your way up.
@_date: 2019-10-11 16:44:03
Your dick is rock hard for all of this, "b...b...BUT THEY COULD!!!"
lol no one gives a shit about that because if they wanted to go after btc, it would have happened YEARS ago.
But i guess this dream makes you happy.
In reality, none of that is happening. Sucks to be you. Youre one of those flat earther fuckers, arent you?
Anyway, theres your bottom line.
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:43:40
Yup thats about what i paid for my first ledger 2 years ago lol. They were cheaper back then...i bought mine because i had hit over 1000 bucks of crypto holdings and told myself if i got that much, it was time for a ledger and ive never looked back since.
  
Ive got..i think 3 total. I bought one of the new ledger Xs months ago but still havent opened it yet.
@_date: 2019-10-13 01:22:12
Ah yes, the "Im so much more intelligent than you!"
lol sure buddy..sure.
You sold at a loss, didnt you.
@_date: 2019-10-03 02:42:17
Well..you cant ban it. And  countries are considering using it to circumvent US sanctions.  
So...its not what you think. Not to mention, its worth alot and it has potential to skyrocket.  
Banks can also make alot of money facilitating crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:35:08
Coinbase rapes you too.       It does suck.
@_date: 2019-10-05 19:17:41
if btc hits say...800 to one mil...then yeah..ill have to consider it. But at that point, how much will ETH be?  
In that case, why even spend BTC?
@_date: 2019-10-04 00:39:26
Banks and financial institutions will die (eventually) if they dont facilitate crypto in any way at all and resist.
Facilitating crypto can lead to other services that banks have..such as loans etc...at least for a time until crypto lending gets easier, and adopted.
I understand clearly. Your arrogant presumptions are quite...puzzling.
Outside of that...JP morgan had a somewhat change of heart...fidelity is looking into facilitating crypto..its growing as they may realize what the future is.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:48:15
But..it already is functioning with or without their stamp of approval.  
Its like trying to ban porn lol
@_date: 2019-10-11 06:14:46
And im amused in how you think bitcoin is a fad that will go away in a year.
Ive seen your type before...
As far as Trump goes, his own party is turning on him especially after that Syria shit went down.
Hes now attacking fox news....hes currently painting himself into a corner .
So...no..not worried about Trump at all.

BTC is a bit different.
Theres only well...less than 21 million....
@_date: 2019-10-13 01:12:25
Oh  man...you stupid fuck...again, they would have already attempted to go after BTC, your moron lol...
Your dumbass thinks that they can stop it like they can stop porn, but ok...if you say so buddy.
lol at the "kids" comment. I get it tho, you think the USA are gods...untouchable..(9/11) unhackable (Office of Personnel Management data breach) safest( mass shootings).
Merica...fuck yea...
@_date: 2019-10-13 16:02:32
I disagree man. I think it will to a point, because if no money is going into it...how can it be used?

Makes me sick to hear that.

@_date: 2019-10-11 16:45:49
Dumbass...if i had put my BTC into USDC when btc hit 14k, and bought now, id almost have 2 btc.
That was my point.
Go play on the freeway, funny guy.

Got a bit butt hurt huh?
That or failed reading comprehension on your part.
@_date: 2019-10-05 19:06:57
Apology accepted.
This is reddit so it conditions you, much like youtube comments to be vicious at any conflicting responses so to that, I also apologize.
I think some banks arrogant enough to try it to be honest.
Banking institutions have deep rooted dominance for decades...but on the other hand, i also believe theres banks that wont try it at all.
For them, its a tough call and I wouldnt want to be the one to make the desicion. From my perspective, its a must to embrace crypto 100 percent.
But for some old dude who got rich off the traditional system, it has to be almost impossible for them to change their perspective so they also may never change their viewpoint.
I really hope when i get old, i can be open minded, but also wise with that open mindedness.
@_date: 2019-08-28 04:35:24
Not a problem. If the amount is low-ish..like 30 bucks, you wont miss it out of your paycheck at all really.
Ideally, 50 bucks is good because youll go 50 out of one paycheck, then then next is 50 = 100 per month...that quick. Say you dont log in for a few months...youll be shocked as hell when you log in next.
That adds up REALLY quick.
But you want it to be low enough where you really dont miss it.
Ive had mine set up for a while and i dont miss it at all.
I dont even pay attention to it really, but what i do pay attention to is when bitcoin has a dip, and depending on how big it is, (2 percent etc) ill buy some every time.
But the more it dips, the more i put in. 
If its like...5 percent then im probably going to put 100 bucks minimum. 5 percent dip for BTC is huge.
But yeah man, start off with the auto deposit and go from there.
@_date: 2019-10-11 16:44:36
Thats sick.
Im going to see if someone can design a shirt or something like that.
@_date: 2019-10-03 01:13:33
(BITCOIN) My first was the cost. Heard about it years ago when it was cheaper saw the price and was like..nah..im good.
Years later it was in the thousands and i realized I messed up.  
It then went from there to me reading the white paper which was excellent btw, and i really dove into the technology and the benefits of not only bitcoin, but cryptos in general.
  
It was a rabbit hole that opened me up to an entire market that gives you true ownership of your wealth and in many ways makes banks pointless.
So while it started as a missed opportunity to invest, it grew into all of the other things like the technology and other personal freedoms.
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:20:25
dude, can you start with 30 bucks then?  
30 bucks a month, then 30 bucks every 2 weeks.
But please just start. We all started somewhere. With zero.
@_date: 2019-10-03 01:15:08
What about US?
@_date: 2019-12-04 05:50:35
They fear the future as they hold dear to what seems to be holding us back (Decline of the US dollar---which probably made them wealthy in the first place).
I wish theyd embrace it..instead of fear it.
They could potentially become even more wealth if they did.
Buffet passed on Apple for YEARS, he passed on Google, Amazon...he had zero faith it Tech companies.
He stuck to what worked but thinks its going to be that way forever.
Clearly, hes not completely correct.

@_date: 2019-12-12 23:15:11
Hey bitcoin forum.
I was with Bitcoin to get rich. I heard the stories.  
Whats funny is, tho, is that when i started doing more research and how it worked and why it was created, a light bulb went on and it became MUCH more political for me which...i would have been in the matrix and not know any better.
  
So yeah i guess i went in reverse, to be honest. The deeper i dug, the more enlightened things got. And yea, like many, i want to be well off..rich...but when you look past that, you can CLEARLY see why BTC was created and the can of worms it can open up.
  
I didnt realize how crooked banks were....because most of the time we live our lives and dont pay attention.   
How they control you, how they can control your money....i mean...i didnt see ANY of this stuff before i got into BTC.
But, again, it wasnt until i started looking at how it worked and why it was created in the first place.
@_date: 2019-12-04 23:17:38

Impeached doesnt mean kicked out of office.
You might want to go back and read up on how govt works.
But..there IS an investigation going on putting forth articles of "impeachment"...so yeah..again, familiarize yourself with the process by reading a book and btw, the Dems are using the process that the Republicans initiated in 2015 for Trump.
  
Yeah.  
Read a book....it might make you smarter.
@_date: 2019-12-06 00:02:31
The Clintons?
lol...when were they in office? Like a DECADE ago? 
Hilary is irrelevant...shes never even been president, and bill has been out for years...so i dont know why the fuck you even brought them up..like it somehow changes the fact that this:
Happened...it doesnt. Those guys are STILL felons.
Tax fraud:
Play politics:
So..that being said, maybe you were referring to trump himself...maybe you were confused.
So yeah, the Clinton shit doesnt work here...I think they again, are irrelevant. They have no power.
Wheres your proof?
@_date: 2019-12-06 00:01:03

It still, cant be "stopped". Slowed down, yea, but stopped?
Fuck outta here with that.
You have WAY too much confidence in the WORLD governments getting along with each other to pass this. They cant agree on shit most of the time.
  
BTC is worth way too much now to be ignored and people can get rich off it. so they arent going to, generally stop btc.

Clearly, Libra is a money grab and the other countries clearly see that.  
Funny cuz with monero, its damn near impossible to even track...but Libra comes out and the world is like, HELL NO!
