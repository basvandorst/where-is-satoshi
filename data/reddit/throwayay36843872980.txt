the merkle root is a cocatenation of all the tx's hashes in a given block, if a block had one more or one less tx the root would differ, merkle roots allows for quick checking that POW has occurred and the only way for that to happen is by expenditure of energy aka mining
im not too sure about reducing the size of the blockchain but it definitely helps lightweight clients that use spv (multibit/electrum) by being able to reference a tx on the blockchain and know its there and has unspent outputs or coins
