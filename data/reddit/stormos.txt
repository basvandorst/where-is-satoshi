50BTC is a proven scam and it's just dead for months.
Also you should try to mine X11 coins. It's optimal for NVidia cards

It's all about sberbank newly accured payment service yandex.money. Duma have to recognise cryptocurrency before they can ban it. I guess Gref just trying to oppose Duma's initiative by throwing a bitcoin bone

GHash.IO supremacy is based on bitfury ASIC. These chips create nonces in specific range and we can outlaw it and ban (temporary) this kind of ASICs from network. It's not a good and smooth measure, but it's a huge leverage in negotiation with GHash.IO masters

Buy some hashing power at services like nicehash and direct it to selected pool

difficulty is rising very fast, so we will see price decline before halving.

higher hashrate means more electricity burning. more electricity means greater fiat outflow. if fiat outflow is not compensated by crypto  outflow (alt season, wide adoption etc) or by new money from investors price goes down.

some miners were caught dusting their own coins to active addresses and profiteering on transactions fees.
'illegal' coins are cheaper.

Try to power it through Molex-to-PCIe adapters instead of native PSU connectors. It works for me.

I believe what selloff was initiated with a single sell-order 10-30K BTC that were processing for about an hour and all traders were able just to observe the situation. And the guy who started that also placed a same value buy-order about $100 below market high.
How much i'm wrong?
