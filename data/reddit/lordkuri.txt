1) I don't live in Wyoming.
2) You said it wasn't a crime to be under the influence of cannabis.  That's not true.
Doesn't matter if "you've ever heard of it".  The law is right there.
Sure, it's stupid as hell.  Doesn't change what the law says.  There's no reason to be hostile.

AmEx changed their policies for new merchants not too long ago so that they say exactly that.  You cannot, (as a merchant) for any reason, dispute a chargeback.
If the buyer calls up AmEx and feeds them a line of crap about something they bought, AmEx will yank that money away from you and slap you with a $45 "chargeback investigation fee".  Get 3 or 4 of those in a month, and you're done with AmEx.

I want an answer to this as well.  This raises a flag.

Yup, I personally canceled 3 accounts because of it.

Like I posted elsewhere, this is most likely a way to gather more personal information about you so your profile is more valuable to prospective buyers when they sell out.  Let's not forget that coinbase is VC funded, and what that means.
While there may be legitimate reasons for this, the cynic in me says it's just another personal info grab to bolster their value before selling.

~~That's not the point.  If he was standing inside the embassy gates, then he was 100% legally "in the USA", and coinbase is in the wrong here.~~
~~That's how the law works. Full stop.~~

~~Ya know, if you were at the embassy, you *technically* were in the USA.~~

You can make up all the BS handwaving excuses you want.  You and I both know you're overcharging by a ridiculous margin.  It is not difficult to find carriers that charge WELL below what you're charging.
I mean, more power to you if you can find people to pay those absurd rates.  I just think they should know what they're getting into.
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:28:57
Probably why that charge quietly went away and isn't talked about anymore.
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:00:54
Yeah and half the prices you're quoting is still overpriced.  Justify it all you want, you know what you're doing.

2.46 cents a minute to US destinations?  Holy shit...  That's absurdly expensive.

During the arrest the police seized 325,000 Euro’s worth In BTC – 48,000 Euro’s In Cash &amp; 320KG of various drugs estimate at about 4.1M Euros along with another 40KG of drugs that were seized later.

WHY do people still think this makes a damned bit of difference?  How does this persist?
The BBB is nothing more than pre-internet Yelp that was ALWAYS very open about being a pay-for-rating scheme.
I guarantee you that Coinbase gives zero fucks about the BBB.
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:30:32


How the hell do you come up with that number?  They charge 1% for anything beyond the first $1,000,000 in sales, and 1% to cash everything out via ACH at the end of the day.
At *most*, you're looking at 2%, and that's only after a *million* dollars in sales.  That's a hell of a lot of sales of small ticket items.
@_date: 2013-09-10 16:34:45
Completely untrue.  You can require that they sign a message (containing the auction number and other information) with the key you are sending the payment to, and attach that as a message with the PayPal payment.
Foolproof? No, PayPal will still screw you at the drop of a hat, of course.  However I've found that anyone wanting to screw you (e.g. stolen PayPal account) won't bother with the trouble, and move on.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:20:07
I don't doubt it in the slightest, which is why I've spent so much time trying to find one.  I'm simply demonstrating that it's not always so easy.
It's not just a matter of walking in the door, signing a few papers, and you're done.

Unfortunately I have zero design talent, which is why I'm looking for one I can just grab and print.  :)

okpay can do it, but the fees are pretty high.

oh the irony...
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:31:56


Just a point.  Unless I'm misreading the TOS (which is entirely possible!) you would actually pay a total of 2% in fees after the first million, as it's 1% of sales, and then 1% conversion fee to cash it out.

Find me a local credit union to the 60018 zip code that I can join without a bunch of employment or union membership requirements, and I'll switch today.

"That is all" ?
As I've said before... Find me a local credit union near the 60018 zip code that I can join without a bunch of employment or union membership requirements, and I'll switch today.
I've been looking for several years, and it just doesn't appear to exist.  Not everyone can "just switch to a credit union already, lol".
