That probably is normal. A lot of gas pumps preauthorize a certain amount of $ before allowing you to pump gas. 
Between Shift, Coinbase and Bitwage, I basically live off my Shift card.

This can probably be accomplished using the Binance API

Shift has top notch customer support too! I emailed backed and forth one of the support reps about a card issues and they responded within minutes (if not right away) during the day time hours.

I did this in March, my initial investment has increased roughly 266%. Couldn't be happier.... not the smartest move but I came out on top.

I wish they did have a full customer support department or even a phone number. When I have issues I usually put them on blast on twitter publicly and they usually respond.

Thank you for explaining this to me. It's unfortunate that I used the Wirex mobile application for this transaction so I didn't get to set the fee. I'd hope in the future they adjust the application to pay the fastest fees. 
At that fee price will this transaction eventually be returned?

I'm sorry to hear about your experience.  Is it possible you misinterpreted the price of bitcoin being sold to you. The price is usually display, and when paying with paypal, due to the risks, people usually charge 2-5+% above market price.  
I have completed many trades on localbitcoins, many with paypal as well and have never had a bad experience.

Last time I was in LA, I was lured in by the sign to find a broken one bitcoin atm... such disappointment.
