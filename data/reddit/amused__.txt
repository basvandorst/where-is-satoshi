I am definitely not, and they put bitcoin in everything related blockchain as if it was evil... very poor professionalism IMO
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:29:31
same here, my BTC is safe in paper wallet so I don't play with those moves, too risky... and longterm looks even brighter right now :)
50K is my goal mark !!!

Well, if you live in a country where the economy is not stable enough to guaranty that tomorrow your currency will still hold against USD, EUR,... maybe you would.

fuck them and their policy, they are stealing from you every year and they feel danger from smarter investors like you...
Who the hell are they to tell you where to invest your money or not... 0,75% is ridiculous...
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:40:17
so, a single mom of three divorce, go to reddit, is hyped and buy 430BTC(like 4M dollars) and it is all the money you had ... very funny story.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:11:39
Thanks for the info, interesting !!!
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:48:42
Thanks for the alternative solution, I might find an old lapto to install the newer version of electrum and keep this on offline all the time.
Other question, I have 2 public addresses, to separate to accounts.
I did 2 tx sending part of my BTC from both accounts, which generated 2 change addresses... is there a way to get the changes back to their corresponding public addresses without spending on fees? It is kind of annoying to keep track of everything.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:21:24
keep the 2FA activation number on paper...
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:37:26
same here, almos 3 weeks now I guess and still no news from them.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:47:20
what does that mean?? do we have settlements in bitcoins now??
Or is it the husband paying her with half the BTC he had, telling the ex to keep it safely in 2 PC at home ... ahahhaa
Then I just ask myself: who knew about the settlement? Husband, lawyers? then you know who can steal those 2 computers i guess
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:05:15
being a short seller means you give the option to someone to buy an asset from you at a predetermined price at a future date. THis strategy is like betting on the price decreasing
So , let's take an example:
On July 2th, price was 10K, so short sellers proposed contract to buy BTC at 9500 on July 8th (today). They thought BTC would go to 8K and they would earn 1500 for each BTC in the contract. But the opposite was realized and today the contracts ended and they had to deliver those BTC to the people they sold the contract. So they had to buy the BTC at 11,5K and sell them at 9500.
Do you get it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:36
surely it will setlle around 15K later on today, it can't grow that fast :/
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:05:38
It was obvious... too much pump here...
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:14:32
it is broken, really broken, they should shut up the site if you want my opinion, really bullshit exchange...
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:07:58
Yes they did answer my ticket support after trying many times and got my approved, but it was not easy, and to tell the truth I stopped using it then, and went to Binance.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:34:47
yeah I already posted that today, interesting, ehhh?

not difficult to understand when you want to buy a game worth less than 10 dollars and your fee is 8 dollar because you want to get your game in the next hour... if you put 0 fee, then maybe you will get your game days later, right??
It is a problem and I am sure Steam could use another crypto competitor in the future, maybe vertcoin, or IOTA...
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:20:01
I tried that thnaks... but gives me a problem
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:11:08
Thanks, I will check that !!!
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:01:33
great buy for sure... enjoy it !!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:04
of course, what's the point in selling right now?
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:02:38
Sell now while it's low, and re-buy back when you start working in a few years when it will be high ... basic rule of trading :P
@_date: 2018-05-09 19:39:44
a new internet like TRON propose to do?

Who are you, the tax representative?? what do you know about taxes law?
In many countries, you can take up to $5K return a month without having to pay tax on that... and it is not a crime, nor tax evasion...
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:25:00
I would not split now... don't forget that BTC is still a psychological strong factor for investing.... what percentage of investors know what is BCH? maybe 5%
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:05:12
I dumped 10K of BCH yesterday... that feels bad :(
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:56:48
I agree that Kraken has lots of issue, but I try Bittrex and it is not better. They can't verify me for the following reason:
"name on the ID not the same to the name registered in my account.
And of course it is the same, I am not THAT dumb... I sent an email to their support but I got no answer in several days now. Kraken has been more reactive and usually answer emails, which is kind of reassuring.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:54:44
I almost took advantage, but I bought 2 hours sooner ahahha... no worry here, I know I will make it back in a couple of days at max.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:59:48
well when you are not "validated", you can still send fund and buy/sell on the exchange, so I sent like 1.2 bitcoins a month ago to buy NEO, and now this is blocked because I can't withdraw it back to my account for example.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:58:33
The main difference between BTC and ETH is not the volume, but the purpose of the coins. ETH deals with smart contracts idea while BTC is just a currency instrument, which in my book is the main difference. Maximum supply is not really a big matter. If you compare BTC to VRT then we can talk about supply, and other stuff.

@_date: 2017-11-06 15:30:43
Bitcoin cahs is the result of previous fork, so basically they are 2 different currencies now, you should only invest money you can loose, and only after investing time to understand what you want to invest in. Also, bitcoin is going through a new fork in 10 days so be careful where you stock your Bitcoins if you choose to buy Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:39:58
yes, I don't understand how big exchange like Bittrex can have such a problem, is it that difficult to hire some people to answer support ticket and get us updated at least.
Kraken has a LOT of server issues, and they apologized for it recently, but still all those exchanges making millions on fees should work harder to make their system more stable and user friendly.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:38:40
you wish...
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:38:48
massive :(
and bitcoin cash is going through the same... I almost sold to get vertcoin last days ... feels bad.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:01:17
this is the answer, would you take that risk?
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:54:31
Thanks, I understand the last bit very well, the system auto-adjust difficulty so that a real attack could not be a very easy thing to do.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:55:42
I dumped yesterday... disgusted right now lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:14:48
I completely agree on this aspect, only HODL if you can handle loosing the whole money you have in it ;)
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:52:19
Yes I read that and saw the second bitcoin cash pump (and dump to come right after)... looks like the difficulty will go back to BTC on december 10th...
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:12:37
By definition, if the majority of people try to sell, it means there is little demand, so it would automatically make the B2X worth nothing... so no change in BTC neither. That is my vision...
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:03:26
Miners are mining BCH now, and confirming BCH transaction now because it is x1.8 more profitable than mining bitcoins.
In 15h more or less they will adjust the difficulty of BCH mining, thus bitcoin will be the more profitable again to mine, soooo people will dump BCH and buy BTC back.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:52:03
What happened with Amazon?? I am not a big client so I really want to understand what's wrong with them?
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:34:30
You should avoid trading after the fork because of replay protection not supported by segwit2x
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:20:29
I am ... wow... massive dump, good times to buy more :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:44:10

@_date: 2017-11-10 13:15:48
Off course I understand it, but if it is worse translating for you guys, and if that could help me a bit, maybe we can work something out...
I reckon Youtube have some sort of an AI translation system embedded, have you tried to choose french subtitles to see if it is understandable?
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:02:50
expect no trading tools, no orders like stop loss... this is a big disadvantage for me.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:53:55
ahahah... 200BTC?? that's a LOT.
it is definitely a stressful day for hodlers :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:23
you mean to buy :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:51:00
we are just -6% from yesterday right now... it is nothing.

Can you just explain in one sentence what Asic Bitcoin means?
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:51:32
they are kind of crap tbh, I used it, had problems trying to sell XRP and buy Bitcoin cash, sent an email to support, and they just say that this happens... I mean I was unable to trade which is pretty bad for a real-time trading platform... very disappointed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:48:02

"Best moment to buy bitcoins is right now"
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:56:46
Not only that, but he should have looked at the market cap / overall volume of coins...
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:55:01
Is there any plan to change that in the future with a soft fork maybe?
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:17:12
Moi aussi :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:34
the exchange is buying right now... free money
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:10
time to buy ...
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:45:21
Well... I guess lots of people will invest at 7K so it should stop a little bit the bleeding.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:46:40
kraken has a 150K limit I think for tier3
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:10:12
man, my plan was pretty good, I wanted to gain on BCH until segwit2x, and then buy VTC on the low before the fork... to buy back BTC after the fork...
I messed up big time because of the cancellation and now I am all in BTC... but holding that hard, I won't do any more shitty emotional move because markets are impossible to predict right now.
I might buy some more BTC and VTC if it falls lower than $4.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:32:12
chill out guys, it's been going up so fast, just relax and wait
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:29
Never sell at market price, always use limit order to control what you are doing.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:07:03
Maybe I could do that, how long is it??
I could really use some extra cash right now :/

this is a really bad addiction man, good luck !!!
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:39:55

I am writing from South America too, have been in Colombia more than 10 times, have relatives over there, lived 5 years in brazil, in Spain when economy crashed and you could find 5 apartments for sell in each building in Madrid, in the USA too... and I traveled a lot, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, name it I went there hehe... well if you want to talk about politics, it is not my thing, but I have my experience and I can tell you that in France right now there is protests that impress me more than everything I have seen in Brazil for example with Dilma impeachment and Lula stuff...
Well, I guess it is just opinions depending on each point of views...
@_date: 2019-01-21 13:26:21
pretty radical observation from someone who probably know nothing about south america local economies...

very good, they acted quickly and in a professional manner, so relieved for all the guys who had losses
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:07:02
can you explain or point out a website where they explain tails iso?? not sure I understand that term. Thanks !!!
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:31:48
but let's be practical, if I have 1 BTC in my electrum wallet now, what will I see after the fork, nothing different because Electrum will not show the alt coins, right? But still my private key will hold 1BTC and 1 of the new coin (BTC2 for example) I guess...
Now what would happen to BTC and BTC2 price at the beggining, will we see a trasnfer of value from 1BTC (old BTC) to maybe 0.8 in the new one and 0.2 in the old one?
I think i share the OP questions...
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:55:25
Just a last question:
I see that Electrum is resetting the public key every day, week,... never. SHould I choose never to use only one public key?
Also I still have one big and important doubt: once I transfered my coins to Electrum, I am the one and only one knowing the private key, but if i want to transfer back thoe coins to Kraken to be able to sell them and get my money back, how to I do that without conecting to the web?
YOu said in one of your post that you can sign the trasnfer offline in Electrum, how is that, and how do i transfer this file to a live machine with Electrum??
I am asking because my Tails is installed on non-persistent pendrive, so how could i trasnfer a file without connecting Tails to the web??
Thanks a lot man, you helped a lot here.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:12:14
Thanks a LOT... this answers lots of my questions.
A few things still remains unclear:
- when you say, in 4), the seed it gives me, do this mean that I am not the one who choose the seed phrase?
I thought the process was: I choose a phrase, it generates the private key, and the public key linked to that private key.
When I do transfer my first 0.001BTC to this public key, and verify then that it went to my account in Electrum, this public address can stay in Kraken for a future transfer? Or do I have to write it each time?
- Public key is only used to receive coins, i.e. there is no security issue with sharing this key, right?
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:13:39
What if I find a .dat file in %TEMP%, do I have to remove it, what do you mean by "files outside of folders"??
The .dat file I found is named "ExchangePerflog_xxxxxxxxx.dat" and is located dirrectly in Temp.
Thanks !!!

@_date: 2017-10-13 14:29:36
So, is there a safe way to keep a large amount while we don't have a nano ledger (or any hard wallet)?
For exemple, Kraken has a 2-Factor security to login or trade, so I guess key loggers could not crack your complete login to the system, right?
Isn't it the same for Electrum or others android wallet?
I am just starting at buying coins and need to decide here to put them while I get a nano S.
Thanks !!!
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:15:12
OK, so can we take an example:
- 2 days ago (1BTC=$6900), Paul think bitcoin is going to 4-5K, so he decided to short sell 1000 BTC at let say 6.5K, and the contract expires in a week later. Paul needs to put $400 * 1000 on an account as collateral, right?
- 2 days later (today), the price goes to $7700 and the new position is worth $1200 * 1000, but Paul doesn't have that much money to put as a collateral, so the position is liquidated, meaning he loses all he had posted as a collateral...
So now, is this what happened?? and how does it matter to the BTC price?
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:27:35
Nice, thanks for your explanation, I am in the same boat, I just bought my first peaces of BTC, and want to test the security with that bit before making more commitment to Crypto.
If you may I have a few questions (very basic).
So, in my case I bought my bitcoins on Kraken, and secured my account with the 2-Factor Authentication, which in my opinion is difficult to crack easily.
So, if I understand well, Kraken is currently holding my coins and "owns/protect" my private keys, is this right?
Next step is keeping my own private keys. I understand that I have several options.
1) I could have my private keys written literally on a paper. In this case, is it a seed (mnemonic words) or is it the direct private key? Also, how do I ask Kraken to transfer my BTC to that private key?? How is the safe way to do it?
2) if I want to use Electrum (desktop wallet), I will create a seed (secret phrase) to access (generate) my private keys, but then where can I be hacked? typing my secret phrase online in Windows for example?
Your tails OS solution I understand is a way to transfer coins to your Electrum wallet without being in Windows, but you still need to be connected to internet, right?
As you see I am a little bit lost, and would love to have one person explain in detail the steps from buying the coins in Kraken to Transfering them to a safe place.
Thanks in advance if you can take the time...
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:48:55
OK now I understand, so basically it is up to the short seller to decide how much he is willing to lose on his position, and so he would post the corresponding margin (taking into account the leverage of the position).
About the second part, I am not sure I understood your point. Let say many people were short selling on a future expiring next week. But the price of BTC shot up, and the same for the future contracts. Then lots of those people position got liquidated today. I don't get how one is related to the other to be honest :(
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:59:44
OK so that was a good explanation, now I get what might have happened this morning, like lots of people had to buy their BTC to pay-back their broker because lots of short sells touched their limit.
But how do we know that only watching at the graph?
(PS: I can't see the link of the OP at work)
