Everything I said is fact
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:47:19
I'll post evidence when I get back to my pc. If you don't want to wait go look at krebs original article

Yeah but there are also $3 wallets that do the same thing. I'm fine with some HW wallets being $70 but this subreddit should stop suggesting $70 hw wallets.

A website used to sell drugs, malware, personal information, and credit cards. It's not like he was just selling pot. He is not a good person.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:45:20
He operated a website that sold malware used in identity and financial fraud. Are you really going to defend someone who knowingly helped people commit fraud? I don't know why you would argue someone like that isn't a bad person

? That's not how you contribute. Write a technical paper before getting anywhere near a pull request. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:21:31
Why would you have to give someone commit access for code review? That's ridiculous 
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:41:05
No shit. Easy capital flight

I expect people who hate the open source community that wrote bitcoin core to write their own implementation.
You can't be anti core and go onto clone the core repo lol
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:57:33
Doesn't core already support segwit? I thought it was fully supported except the GUI side
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:33:02
Mobile data is just a test area for isps. Look at data caps as an example 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:25:29
Nothing is wrong with tax avoidance. Topics like this make the bitcoin community look bad 
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:07:26
Stocks are no where as volatile 
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:16:45
Hashpower doesn't make something bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:23:42
Both parties would be better off.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:03:26
Not really. There is risk, but it's no where near the same risk as gambling 
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:37:38
People who support bitcoin cash get upset when people call it "bcash. I think the person above is implying that you are causing the very infighting that could destroy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:33:09
Why are you acting like core is a group that controls bitcoin? You do understand that it is a open source project where anyone can commit to? 
No one is getting banned for discussing ideas. Write a paper and discuss it. Most people would rather rant about conspiracies instead of doing anything of value 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:53:31
True. Hw wallets aren't for everyday use tho
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:35:37
He likely stole a lot from someone. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:52:33
Of a major company? Yeah 
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:47:12
Maybe, but a good low cost hw wallet needs to be created if bitcoin wants to become a global currency 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:23:42
Both parties would be better off.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:49:37
Prevent doxing.

Your link shows 5 pools at 60%+ hashrate. Most of those pools are controlled by 1-2 people each. Don't pretend this isn't a problem.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:48:18
Regularly losing funds due to hacks? I don't see how 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:33:43
Why don't you like ethereum? Eth is like the one other crypto that has interesting and useful tech.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:40:17
Lack of a (good) cheap hw wallet is an issue. 
Ledgers and trezors are nice, but bitcoin won't be adopted en mass if you have to pay $70+ for a hw wallet
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:10:36
It's less than 10
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:09:42
What? Why would you get paid to run a node?
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:14:42
We are going to need cheaper hw wallets. $70 is a lot of money to many in the west, let alone those in poorer countries
