When people ask things like, "I don't see why they need X or did Y" they are not asking in good faith. They are attempting to make the claim that they don't need X and shouldn't have done Y. By forming the claim as a question as if from ignorance they are attempting to shift the onus of backing up their claim onto everyone else.
Avoid that pit, force them to actually make and back up the claim they're pussyfooting into the conversation.

The assumption isn't true. But you describe the Lightning Network well.
The Lightning Network is a set of people connected to all other people on the network via payment channels.

If a minority of developers made changes to the git repo against the wishes of the majority, then the majority would fork the project. Simple.
And whatever is in the git repo, it's still the full nodes and miners that choose what they run on their machines. They can run anything the like.


This is just such a bizarre claim that it's almost schizotypal. And your "explanation" is just more bizarre claims.

From the near unanimous consensus of experts. Which is easy to verify with empirical evidence both past and present. Bigger block sizes raises the cost of entry to the mining market and advantages bigger miners at the expense of smaller miners. 


That claim is false and downright bizarre.
A community of independently collaborating volunteers has *no* mechanism by which to stall or force protocol changes.
Miners and full nodes run whatever software they like.

I already addressed your baseless claims in the message you replied. If you ignored it the first time, I assume you'll ignore it the second.
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:47:29


No, I am not. Miners are full nodes that also mine. It is mining that is most strongly affected by block size. A miner must be able to receive all blocks as fast as possible and broadcast their blocks to everyone as fast as possible. Even very slight speed disadvantages can cause a miner to lose huge amounts of money and become unprofitable. Bigger blocks gives bigger miners ways of attacking smaller miners.


No one 'controls core'. It's a git repo and a process for reviewing and merging pull requests. There are about 50 active developers. A handful have merge access, but doesn't give any special privilege or control. Anyone can contribute. Anyone can fork the project.
What control do you imagine a couple developers funded by blockstream could possibly have over a community of 50+ developers? 
Also, Chain code labs funds the most developers. Why don't you think they 'control core'? 
Bitmain is number 3 in terms of core developers funded. Why aren't you worried about them?

If you don't run a full node, you are trusting the people that are to govern your economy, much like you trust your government and banks now.
If you can't run a full node, you have no voice in the Bitcoin economy. At least in a democracy you can vote, campaign, or run for office.
To be more clear, full nodes don't decide the rules through voting. When you run a full node you enforce the rules you choose. Anyone that plays by different rules basically doesn't exist to you. Likewise, if you play by rules that no one else recognises, you don't exist in their network.

The size of the fees is determined by what people are willing to pay and what miners are willing to accept.
On chain transactions are currently limited for security. Increased adoption has recently pushed transaction levels to capacity. And most businesses have not developed software to intelligently manage fees under these conditions.
It's not ideal, but should be temporary.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:29:40
We have a real world example of what you were suggesting. It is good empirical evidence against your claim. Also, it mostly true that the only developers that agree with an increase to 8mb are Bcash, ABC, Classic, etc developers.
A block size increase of that size would reduce fees by making Bitcoin's most serious problem, mining centralisation, much worse. A single CEO of a single company was able to hold the Bitcoin network to ransom for half a year trying to push a protocol update that would benefit them against the interests of the rest of the network.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:33:10
Mining centralisation caused Bitcoin nodes to split into 2 classes: miners and full nodes. Really, they were always 2 classes, but in the early days it generally made sense to talk about them as the same thing. 
So, the original plan was for full nodes to be incentivised by mining.
Currently, the only incentives are financial sovereignty, trustless verification of all economic activity, and the ability to choose the rules of your economy.

High fees suck. And it sucks that some mining pools were not prepared for higher fees. 
But remember, the open source community of developers provided a doubling of transaction throughput a year ago and so far the miners and exchanges have blocked it and chosen not to use it.
The most prominent people complaining about fees are the ones blocking any reduction of fees and then blaming the only group that has actually delivered solutions to increase transaction throughput and decrease fees.
Why would they be doing that? Well, it's because they don't want big blocks for the reasons they are claiming. So, we have to ask ourselves, why do they want them? And why are they lying about it? And why have they chosen as their enemy an open source community of independently collaborating volunteers that have intelligently, ethically, and responsibly maintained the protocol for almost a decade?

The block size will be increased:
1. As needed. Transaction throughput was just nearly doubled. Fees could be drastically lowered right now if exchanges, miners, wallet developers want to.
2. As the protocol is optimised to handle larger blocks - at the levels of CPU, storage, and networking.
3. With proper testing and review.
4. With near unanimous buy in from each class of user: devs, miners, full nodes, SPV, etc.

I'm not sure who or what you're arguing against here. But, I'll venture an answer. The development of these things either has been crowd-funded or is being produced without funding. Future development will likely progress similarly. These contracts and systems are open source. In operation, there will be arbiter fees, transaction fees, deposit bonds, and many other frictions and controls that are familiar to us today.

Bitcoin is money for the internet. But it's more than that. It's the internet of money - an open network of digital money, a global economy for anyone to join and build on. But it's more than that. Bitcoin is programmable value. Money, votes, property, stocks, anything of value can be operated on algorithmically. But it's more than that. Bitcoin is a decentralised, peer-to-peer, open source protocol that defines a trustless, digital, ledger-based economy with no third-party risks and no centralised gatekeepers. Bitcoin is money issued by algorithm, secured by cryptography, instantly transferable, borderless, and open to all.

Bitcoin is the invention and first application of a new way of organising human society - one that is truly global, open by design, and free for anyone to join and build on. It proves the concept of a system with no central authority, no embedded aristocracy, no special classes, no middlemen, no gatekeepers, no big brother - just peers, voluntarily transacting and interacting in full faith toward the increase of peace and prosperity for all.

The bitcoin network often appears inefficient because much of the work it is performing is kind of invisible and usually taken for granted. This work is 'trust work'. This work is usually called verification, confirmation,vetting, risk management, auditing, regulation, etc...
The traditional (read: historical) model of trust work goes this way:
Alice would like to exchange with Bob. However, Alice doesn't know if Bob is trustworthy. To offset the risks and costs of trusting Bob, Alice engages a trusted third-party TrustCo Inc. This is an efficient and straightforward method of minimising risk in the exchange between Alice and Bob. However, by centralising trust work for efficiency and security, we have also introduced a point of failure. Worse, we have set a limit of participants that is defined by the maximum work capacity of our centralised 'trust work' entity, TrustCo Inc.
This model has many benefits and has served humanity fairly well. However, it inevitably leads to crises and does not scale well. In a blockchain network - such as Bitcoin - trust work is distributed as evenly as possible across all participants in the network. This reduces, perhaps even removes, the points of failure. It also means that each new participant that enters the network doesn't just increase the trust work required, they also perform trust work. As long as the system allows each new participant to perform more trust work than they require, then the system scales by design.
This new kind of method is actually very, very old. This article explains it well.

By operating on the bitcoin blockchain, financial and commercial transactions and simple contracts can be verifiable as accurate and honest without requiring trusted intermediaries.
This means that the points of failure - inherent in all systems of trust - can be reduced or even eliminated by relying merely on the continued existence and proper operation of the network.

That's a fair point. Though, without anonymity tools and good privacy practices, any bitcoin transaction is likely to let anyone at any time, now, or in the future, trace your coin to an ID somewhere. One can use the internet anonymously and use bitcoin anonymously. But both are prone to comparable privacy losses.

It's such a pity that gossip is easier to sell than knowledge. And that even in democratic, free market societies people still fail to appreciate that all the modern comforts we enjoy are enabled by open systems of trade. Unapproved drug use is just so trivial in comparison. I'd love to see a newscaster just monologue: "Imagine what the world would be like if no one could buy or sell anything. Everything you had you either had to make yourself, steal, or hope someone was kind or foolish enough to give to you. Now imagine a world where most people can buy and sell most things with some people. That's now. That's us. And all the prosperity that exists in the world today is enabled by our partially open systems of trade. Open bazaar creates a system of open trade that is maximised to planetary constraints. It is part of the eclipse and fulfillment of capitalism."
But it's always difficult to grasp or articulate the value of open systems in which all participants are able to experiment and generate value. An unfortunate quirk of our cognitive/verbal processing. A dictator can be smart or foolish and kind or cruel, that's easy to grasp. But how does one describe the value of the leader in a democracy?

You are correct that there are 2 instances of trust required here. Fortunately, for the first time in history we have an open, decentralised, trustless platform for financial innovation that opens up the possibility of developing protocols and service that requires minute, even perhaps zero, trust.
More immediate, however, is the point I was making by use of Bitstamp as an analogous example: digital, programmable money allows businesses to deliver financial services at $0 to customers in order to obtain market share, consumer data, etc. Moreover, with open source and hobbyist movements, these services gradually become cheaper and freer. These 2 forces combined produce a race toward free.

This is the best explanation of a smart contract I've come across.
It quotes the best, shortest explanation by Peter Todd, "Conclusion of smart contract discussion: no-one has a clue what a smart contract actually is, and if we did it'd need oracles."
That said, I'll take a crack at a plain english, practical look at a smart contract.
A contract is an enforceable agreement between two parties. A smart contract differs from a paper contract in several ways:
* it can possess money independently of any human. The advantage here is that you trust the network, not a centralised third party.
* it can automatically perform its code (enforce the terms of the agreement). The advantage here is that the contract does not require a legal system that derives its legitimacy via a monopoly of physical force.
This makes it both more limited in use - better suited to data-driven, logic-based agreements - and more useful in other ways - efficient, open access, things we haven't thought of yet.
Example 1. College Allowance.
Your child moves across the country to study. You want to ensure they have enough money to get by, but you're also concerned about their financial acumen. With these things in mind, you write up a smart contract. You direct debit a portion of your wage into the smart contract on each pay. From this amount, your child can withdraw funds according to time-based rules. Two days before rent is due, an amount equal to the rent becomes available for withdrawal. Each week, an amount becomes available for the food budget. Each friday, a leisure allowance becomes available. But what if something goes really wrong, like a car accident or eviction?
Example 2. (Actually) Personal insurance.
As a responsible parent and family member, you would like to ensure financial security for those you care for. So you write up an insurance smart contract for your family and extended family. Each member contributes a portion of their pay into the contract. If an emergency arises, any member that has kept up with their contribution (or nearly enough) may request a withdrawal. If m of n family members digitally sign the withdrawal, the requested amount is released. This process can occur as quickly as a few minutes with people signing from anywhere in the world. No fees, no hidden catches.
Example 3. Family Trust.
Lastly, as a responsible parent, you might place your assets and other wealth into a trust. This is an agreement between family members and a bank in which spending or selling anything requires m of n parties to sign off and the bank to secure and enforce the arrangement. With a smart contract-based family trust, the agreement is codified in the blockchain, this codified agreement (the smart contract) possesses the family wealth, when m of n parties sign off on an expenditure, the contract verifies and spends.

The invention of bitcoin is a solution to the problem of having a number of parties agree about who owns what without using trusted third parties. 
Instead of trusted third parties, an open market of transaction verifiers secures the network. These verifiers or miners are incentivised with bitcoin. Each miner races to be the first to verify the pending transactions which unlocks a bitcoin payout. 
This is the solution to having a secure, distributed database of value - a blockchain - without relying on trusted third parties. 
Without a unit of account incentivising  an open market of verifiers, there is no solution and no blockchain.

This is essentially how the Lightning Network works and it seems clear that Bitcoin will serve as a trust/enforcement backbone to many systems.

I think I understand your point and essentially agree. I think it's also well worth pointing out when people describe Bitcoin as the best performing currency.

It is important to be factual and reasonable when describing Bitcoin to people who don't understand it. And misinformation can be very disappointing, even frustrating.
However, no false claim was made by Voorhees. Bitcoin has been the best performing currency in each, but one, year in terms of relative price movements.

Your housewife character engages in that spending behaviour in large part because of the particular properties and constraints of the financial systems around her.
When the financial systems around her change by 10 to 1,000,000x orders of magnitude, so will her spending behaviour.
We can speculate on what those changes might be in her spending behaviours. Let's say her smart home begins using an open market of electricity suppliers which allows dynamically updating charges per kilowatt hour. There's a bunch right there. Let's add that she decides to use a decentralised storage solution to host her website which is paid per 10 minutes. There's some more. Maybe she decides to route payments to cover some of the cost of her own transaction fees. That could give us the million right there.
These are 3 speculative examples. There are countless others. Any small number of which could give us the million we're chasing. Hell, if someone figures out a way to do high frequency trading over Lightning Network - something like Discreet Log Contracts - we could see her hit the million multiple times an hour from her smartphone on charge overnight.

On each point you are mistaken. LN transactions are 'instant' because they are simply valid transactions being updated and are backed by funds locked into a channel. The time locks are used to return funds in disputes such as a node going offline. Anyone connected to the LN can transact with anyone else on the network.
Think of LN like an open, permissionless VISA network that runs on Bitcoin. Put some money on your card (fund your channel) and spend your Bitcoin anywhere LN is accepted. What's more, you can be part of the network, routing transactions and taking a small fee. 
Faster, cheaper, more private, and more scalable than any other system.

Mining centralisation is at a critical level. Node count is low and perhaps not diverse enough.
Doubling the pressure on nodes and the advantage of the largest, nearest miners is like playing Russian roulette.
A single miner just held the entire network to ransom for almost a year. Massively increasing their ability to do that is beyond foolish.
Add to that the fact that a block size increase will not provide any benefit in the short to medium term and one has to wonder at the profound confusion of anyone advocating for it. Or defend against their malice toward Bitcoin itself.

* bunch of technical fixes that improve efficiency, scaling, and security.
* makes multi-signature addresses more secure against potential attacks
* almost doubles the block size allowing almost twice as many transactions per second and decreasing the cost of fees
* allows faster, more intelligent adoption of new protocol upgrades. May help prevent this latest debacle in getting segwit activated
* enables Lightning network, which is like a payment processor that runs on top of bitcoin providing secure, trustless, private, instant, insanely cheap transactions at a scale potentially greater than all other processors combined. Also, trustless swaps between cryptocurrencies. Also, like bitcoin, anyone can be part of the lightning network and get paid for routing fees. Might be enough to cover some or all of your own fees (which are miniscule).
* enables MAST (not yet developed) which will add complex smart contracts to bitcoin in a way that is scalable and private.

Many that claim to be for it really are not.
They simply want to block segwit because their incentives are misaligned with the network's (i.e. you and I) and to obtain control of development ("fire core") and have sole choice over protocol upgrades ("only miners are nodes").
Whether or not they realise it, they trying to convert Bitcoin into a corporate aristocracy that can be trivially captured by even single nation state.

Of course they will. Even by you description they can send 1 million transactions that are less than or equal to the amount with which they funded their channel divided by 1 million. 
More importantly, channels are bidirectional, meaning you can spend and receive. 
The term "hub" is used in hub and spoke networks. The Lightning Network is not a hub and spoke model. 
That you use this term suggests that the source of your information is either ignorant or willfully deceptive. A hub and spoke model is highly centralised with a vast majority of nodes able only to transact with each other via a small minority of hubs with extremely high centrality. 
The Lightning Network is a mesh network. It allows anyone to open a channel with and route payments through anyone. Some nodes will have higher centrality than others, however this is the case in all mesh networks.

Stock splits are not adversarial actions.
The BCash altcoin was created because a cartel failed to take control of Bitcoin. They are now attempting to use Bitcoin branding, social and mainstream media campaigns, and the work of an open source development community to fool people into thinking that their altcoin is Bitcoin, rather than a corporate-owned, inefficient PayPal. 
In a regulated commercial market, the corporations running Bcash would be taken for everything they've got in court.
 This is simply latest in a long series of deeply unethical and irresponsible behaviour.
If one cares about financial access and autonomy, one would hope that Bcash fails and these bad actors take a financial penalty for their hostility toward the Bitcoin network. One would also hope that Bcash succeeds and they stay far away from Bitcoin.

There are several reasons a miner may want a block size increase:
* Ignorance of the engineering realities,  overconfidence, and, at this late stage, pride.
* An expectation that a block size increase will allow faster adoption and a greater number of smaller transaction fees.
* A fear that a price increase due to hitting the block size limit will slow or stop adoption.
* A desire to continue using the Covert AsicBoost exploit to mine using less power than other miners.
* As part of a strategy to wrest development away from the open source community into the hands of a couple of small, closed development teams funded by one or two corporations

Routing nodes are not trusted. It is a trustless system. 
The amount that you can transact is less than or equal to the total funds in your channel. So, the routing nodes need only have as much funds as yourself or greater. Essentially, all you care about is whether or not a particular node is up and if it has ever shot itself in the foot by failing to route in the past.
Each node is incentivised to route payements for transaction fees either for profit or to reduce/eliminate the cost of one's own transactions.
A routing node seeking profit is incentivised to add more funding to channels. However, the more funds in a channel, the greater the risk of loss. And other nodes won't care how much they have funded beyond the small amount they wish to transact.

With BTC Relay &amp; Raiden, Ethereum can be used as a temporary 'smart bitcoin' chain. 
The cheaper transactions on rootstock are likely temporary and due to increased trust. 
Bear in mind, Rootstock uses a federated peg. It is a permissioned chain with its base unit value-pegged to Bitcoin.
At this stage, Ethereum has greater guaruntees of immutability, trustlessness, and censorship resistance - as unsatisfactory as those guaruntees may be.
2-way pegged, merge-mined sidechains do not yet have proven designs. It is my impression that we'll see drivechains live first.
Not to rain on the parade. Rootstock is very cool and I'm sure it will become increasingly trustless as sidechain technology is further developed and tested. Just noting that this tech is still at a very early stage.

If drivechains or full sidechains are successfully developed and implemented, the RSK sidechain would then be a competitor to Ethereum.
However, with Ethereum going PoS, sharding, etc, etc. It may become differentiated enough from Bitcoin and its sidechains that it will inhabit a different ecological niche - different security model, different economics, different development goals, different relationship with legacy systems.

The key elements of the bitcoin blockchain that a private chain retains is that to make a change you must convince at least half of the other participants to also make the change. And that all changes and change approvals are recorded.
This reduces the inter-organisational trust required to interact.

It's dangerous and provides no benefit.

Dynamic resizing methods have been explored in depth and they are, in a general sense, a good idea. However, they have not been implemented because they greatly increase the complexity of an already complex issue and because they haven't been sorely needed. I'm sure there is more to it than that.
A potential issue I see with your idea is that larger miners might happily take a loss in order to increase the block size for enough time to squeeze out smaller competitors. Then, once the difficulty has been reduced, they reduce block size, recoup their losses, and generate substantially higher profits.

Actual title: Forget Bitcoin, Long Live Blockchain


The scarcity is programmed, however it is enforced by economic competition.


Bitcoin is not a mesh network. A mesh network is an internet infrastructure of wifi or other wireless devices.
Bitcoin is a layer on the IP system. In fact, Satoshi Nakamoto's original intention was that pay-to-IP address would be the standard method of payment.
The 'IP' system is not hub-and-spoke, it is decentralised. Though, the hardware it runs on, and the cloud services that run on it, are both hub-and-spoke, or rather, networks with increased centrality and under national political control.
And the DNS that IP addresses are mapped to is centralised.


A blockchain cannot be decentralised without a token. The distribution of the unit of account incentivises the economic competition required.


Mainstream media articles speculating about the exchange rate of Bitcoin is not the measure of its hype. Continued growth in github projects and commits and a 100% increase in investment might be decent measures.


Is it disingenuous or merely an oversight that the author fails to mention that 99% of this money was invested in Bitcoin companies?


Bitcoin is not just a payment system
Bitcoin is not just a payment system
Bitcoin is not just a payment system
Bitcoin is not just a paym..


Not completely secured, but otherwise fair.


Bitcoin wouldn't be much use if a block could only contain one transaction. I'm sure that would be a quick and easy block size debate.


Perhaps not an error, just an oversimplification. However, reorganisations are fairly common in which the most recent blocks can be 'replaced'.


The locality of the ledger is decentralised in that all changes go to all parties. However, it is centralised in that approval of those changes comes from a smaller number of authorities.


Again failing to mention that the blockchain in use is Bitcoin.

Best to steer clear of the spiritual talk. There's enough mockery of Bitcoin for evangelism and cultishness.
I believe the cause of the shift actually came from the people describing Bitcoin. Most people learning about it for the first time get stuck on the digital currency part. There is an incredible mix of familiarity, ignorance, myths, and overconfidence when it comes to money that any conversation about an innovation almost inevitably gets bogged down in politics, economics, or mere confusion.
So, it was easier to say, "here's the money. But forget about that for a minute. Just look at the technology. Look at all the cool things it can do. We can both agree on that."
Technology is simple and usually doesn't threaten worldviews, ideologies, or egos. And it gave people who had dismissed or mocked Bitcoin a way to capitulate without admitting any error.
Unfortunately, what was an analogy, "the blockchain technology that underlies bitcoin" became a mantra of the financial laypersons.

OpenBazaar is and will be for some time quite the opposite of a darknet market (DNM). It literally is an open bazaar.

It should not be recommended to anyone selling items restricted by their local laws.

To steal a phrase, decentralisation isn't the thing. It's what gets you to the thing.

The trouble is that the distinction doesn't run directly along the line between public and private. A 'permissioned ledger' or 'tokenless blockchain' or 'know-your-miner replicated state machine' or whatever can be run publically. 
The key distinction is that control is centralised, trust is required, and increasing public-ness also decreases security.

I'm sorry, I must be missing a few steps here. It seems you are arguing that to be a solution, Bitcoin must, but can't, completely replace all banking and other financial systems and organisations. I may have given the impression that this was my claim. I don't believe that the problem of banks are solved by being completely destroyed and replaced - although I do predict that many will. We still have physical book stores and some went online. We will still have physical banks and some will go on-chain. The solution means that we have choice because they have competition. They will be held accountable to a market of consumers who will have the choice to control their own funds, choose their preferred monetary policy, choose service organisations that are logged on-chain. 
It also seems that you are looking at Bitcoin now to say it can not replace a sufficient proportion of legacy finance to serve most people's needs, instead of looking at what Bitcoin will be in 5, 10, 20 years. You're aware of lightning network so you're likely aware of sidechains and enigma. And perhaps aware of some variations of these and other similarly trustless or minimal-trust extensions to Bitcoin. Surely, these massive innovations within the first few years of Bitcoin provide you some confidence that the system can scale sufficiently to serve most or all legacy financial functions and many new ones that will replace them.
Consider any technology in its first few years and compare it to 20, 50, 100 years later. Most are hardly recognisable. Do we expect Bitcoin to be any different?

I'm not sure if I understand you correctly. Where is the "there" that you refer to and do you mean virtually no fees are paid for interbank transfers? 
To venture a reply: Banks work very hard to hide the costs of trust work, hierarchy, and analogue technologies from their customers. What isn't paid by a consumer in a transaction is paid by someone somewhere. In whatever ways these costs are moved around or abstracted they still limit the ability of banks to provide financial services.

I'm not aware of any reason that it might not.
Ripple cannot transfer Bitcoin. Ripple can transfer digital tokens that represent Bitcoin. However, these digital tokens are not Bitcoin. They are only redeemed for Bitcoin. This requires that you trust an entity to hold Bitcoin and honour redemption.
Sidechains transfer Bitcoin. The digital tokens that exist on a sidechain are created by trustlessly converting Bitcoin and this conversion may be reverted at any time for an equal value of Bitcoin. That is, you can independently convert Bitcoin into the sidechain tokens and back again without a counterparty and end up with the same amount of Bitcoin  (minus transaction fees).
Transfers on a sidechain can be faster and cheaper because instead of using the powerful, global, trust-minimising proof of work consensus algorithm of the main chain, you may limit the number of miners to a number of entities that you trust and merely rely on that trust and the high security/auditability of the blockchain.

Not necessarily. It is common to say 'off-chain' when one means 'centralised database', but that isn't the only off-chain solution. Lightning Network is an example of a system that allows transactions to be made off-chain without trusting any 3rd parties. This is often referred to as a Layer 2 solution. See: 
Additionally, the essential point of Bitcoin is that you don't *have to* trust third-parties. That doesn't mean you *can't* or *shouldn't ever*. There are some cases where trust-based solutions can be deployed usefully.

The Lightning Network (LN) is Bitcoin. Simply put, the LN just uses a different transaction type than a standard transaction. The rest of the protocol is about updating transaction states between parties.
A standard LN transaction is updating the eventual state of a multisig address which exists in the blockchain. The guaruntees that make those updates meaningful requires that the LN transactions (the updates to the multisig) can be applied at any time as a multisig transaction.
If you "scrap blocks and blockchains" you scrap Bitcoin and the LN. Just like if you 'scrap the dirt' you scrap the ant's nest and the ants.

Again, no evidence.
A network can adopt new software that includes replay protection and have the entire network or a supermajority move to it and retain the same name. And do so without coercion or significant contention. 
Because that is true, your attempt to distinguish between an altcoin and an "upgrade" using replay protection is completely false.
But what's worse is that you consider a handful of strangers deciding the rules of Bitcoin to be "wonderful and "decentralised".
This is the complete opposite of Bitcoin.
Voting on consensus rules by hashpower is equivalent to 1 vote per fiat dollar and is indistinguishable from a tyrannical aristocracy. 
1 vote per fiat dollar ensures that the unreachable upper limit of Bitcoin's security and decentralisation is equal to that of the fiat economies its consensus rule changing mechanism is dependent on.

Miners put things in order. Full nodes decide rules.
Miners decide the order of blocks and inclusion of transactions. Full nodes decide the validity of blocks and transactions.

You are using the terms 'Bitcoin user' and 'Company (e.g. Coinbase) user' as synonyms. They do not mean the same thing. They are, essentially, the opposite.

If you run a full-node then you are actively exercising financial sovereignty. To use an analogy that has become a cliche: you are your own bank.

While I agree with most of your statements, you've framed the situation as a choice between public and private blockchains and used, as analogy, a choice between a public and private service. 
Bitcoin is an extension of the internet into the spheres of finance, law, and governance. The internet is not a state or private service in the way that a courier service is, although the maintenance of its infrastructure may be performed by state and private entities. The internet is a global, near zero marginal cost, programmable, public, two-way platform and it is the multitude of conversations that occur on that platform.
"A private intranet that can be accessed by all major financial institutions, but not the general public..." is what we have today. And it is quite powerful. Even more powerful than the media distribution networks, at their height, that could be accessed by all major media institutions, but not the general public. 
It's amazing that Eris is bringing the ability to set up networks like that to developers and entrepreneurs as FOSS. But the internet is the remarkable phenomenon that it has become precisely because it is accessible to the general public and because it is not a one-way monologue from institutions to the public.
The Eris documentation says it best:








The remarkable thing about Bitcoin was that it was the first value exchange network in which these permissions were public. The term blockchain, by osmosis, came to mean exactly that.
The recently introduced terms 'Permissioned' and 'Permissionless' are extremely useful to distinguish between Eris-like and Bitcoin-like ledgers or blockchains. And to end on a positive note, it is undeniably a great thing that Eris is reshaping the concept, extending the tech, and bringing fire down from the mountain.

Imagine if all the people posing with the blockchain and deriding "the currency" were right? Imagine if they had discovered a way to produce an open-access, global, low friction, trustless, database of value that requires no incentivisation of miners? Have they hacked the human mind to perform perfect altruism? 
The best, simplest framework for this question, I think, is to think of Bitcoin as the open internet and blockchains with no miner incentivisation as personal, internal, or proprietary networks. Both great. The former with a capital 'G' and the latter with an unemphatic shrug.
Bitcoin is a peer to peer network for the transfer of value. It is a creative combination of several related innovations. The major unique contributions of Satoshi Nakamoto to the field were (1) the use of proof of work to ensure that labour was required to 'mint' each unit of value in a distributed database and (2) the application of an open market to find an optimal solution for 'trusted' transaction processing instead of using designated third parties. 
These two innovations produced three very cool things: digital scarcity (copy+paste be damned); non-institutional scarcity (lemme just email this gold bullion kthx); and an open financial database that, like the internet and all open protocols, allows innovation without permission ("We don't want people opening banks out of their garage." - Ben Lawsky... well, actually we do and Bitcoin let's that work).
All that being said, the blockchain has a number of very valuable properties. Removing its 'trustless' properties still leaves many of its advantages as a secure, distributed, programmatic database of value - bearing in mind that you're still making a trade-off between efficiency and control. This is like an internal or intra-organisational network. It's not the internet writ large, but it's useful perhaps to the point of necessary. 
Then, say we add (sort of) turing-complete smart contracting and now we have a lot of uses for a centralised blockchain. Again, as always, it is not the internet of money and we are making trade-offs, but there is a massive array of use cases.

Bitcoin is neither of those things. Those are analogies used to explain aspects of Bitcoin. While they are useful to an extent, beyond that extent they both mislead. In fact, if Bitcoin was actually identical to either of those analogies, it would be a failed experiment.

It's quite a bit worse than that. With high barriers to entry for ISPs, openness of IP addresses, BGP routing, centralised DNS, the fragility of HTTP, and the NSA splicing into undersea cables, the internet is rather worryingly centralised.
Here's hoping for success in P2P protocols, nakamoto consensus, increased ISP competition (e.g. SpaceX, Google, Facebook for a start), and tokenised mesh networking.

Escrow and arbitration. 
You make payment to an escrow address that requires 2 of 3 signatures to release the funds to the seller.
When your package arrives and you're satisfied you sign the transaction and release the payment to the seller. 
If you don't release the funds, the seller calls in a pre-agreed arbiter who reviews the transaction and makes a judgement call.
Arbiters are chosen from an open market of arbiters with reputations.

You appear to think Lighting Network is a simple payment channel. If you replace every instance of 'Lighting Network' in your comment with 'payment channel' then your comment would be correct.
Lightning Network is an extension of the payment channel concept to allow users to route their payments through multiple 'hops'. Each hop is a Lightning Network user that chooses to route payments. So, as long as you have a channel open with anyone routing payments on the Lightning Network you can transfer money to anyone else on the network.
Like a credit card network for Bitcoin, except permissionless, trustless, cheaper, faster, and private. And it enables other new functionalities that are quite exciting.

Counterparty, colored coins, and T0 have simiar aims, but different approaches.
Counterparty lets you add a transfer of an asset (e.g. company stock) into a transfer of Bitcoin. It's like adding a second asset to a Bitcoin cheque.
Colored coins associates a particular fraction of a Bitcoin with an asset. It's like saying this piece of Bitcoin also represents this much company stock - basically colouring the coin.
T0 hasn't fully disclosed their method. They seem to be using a combination of their own permissioned/private blockchain (no info yet on how this operates) and the Bitcoin blockchain.

The key difference is that health insurance and banking are services and well-known industries. Internet and Bitcoin are protocols/ infrastructure.
A more appropriate analogy would be a journalist saying:
"Electricity CEO injured in car accident"
Even if this came to be a widely used means of expression, there would still be the issue of misleading people.
Bitcoin is a unique case of a protocol/infrastructure that performs work that most people do not yet realise can be accomplished without a person or organisation being responsible for it. Who issues the currency? No one. Everyone. The algorithm. The network. 
Understanding this concept is crucial to how people perceive bitcoin and will greatly influence how they vote, lobby, and adopt it.

Not a slippery slope argument. Bitmain and co have publicly stated their intentions to increase the cost of running a node to $20k. They are currently abusing their out-sized influence to coerce the users of the network. The segwit2x fork creates a block size limit of *8mb* which will massively increase their ability to centralise mining power and massively decrease the number and diversity of full nodes which are currently our front-line defense against a centralised cartel's ransom demands.

Bizarre adversarial case? That case is now. We're there. This is an adversarial network with enormous financial incentives to cheat and a cartel hell-bent on coercing the users of the network to accept upgrades that serve the cartel's short-term interests at the expense of the user's interests and the long-term value of the network.

I just listened through from minute 9 to around minute 18. I've listed the criticisms below. I have bolded items that seem worth discussing. I address these at the end. I have strikethroughed items that are just insults and baseless accusations (I left most off the list). I have italicised items that are essentially meaningless because they are baseless - lacking explanation or evidence. At the bottom of the list I quote a standard definition of trolling for the reader to compare and draw a conclusion.
* ~~OpenBazaar is stupid~~
* **Bitcoin is "uncensorable", but Openbazaar is only "uncensored"**
* **If someone shuts down your Bitcoin "relay node", you havent been censored because your coins remain accessible. If someone shuts down your OpenBazaar "relay node" then your store goes offline.**
* *OpenBazaar is not a Bitcoin project.*
* ~~OpenBazaar developers have misrepresented shopify fees - "straight up lying" - because they stated Shopify fees are 2.9% + 50c, but did not also state that purchases in bitcoin on shopify do not incur the same fees.~~
* ~~OpenBazaar developers are incompetent.~~
* **Although OpenBazaar may remove middlemen, they only do so in such a way that the value added by the middlemen is lost with no significant advantage gained.**
* *OpenBazaar will fail because too few of the podcast's listeners have purchased items from Shopify using Bitcoin*
* ~~Open bazaar developers have a lack of cognizance of issues.~~
* ~~*Openbazaar developers have lied that sellers on the platform will not need to advertise because customers will magically find them.*~~
* **OpenBazaar will fail because it competes with Amazon and ~every customer will use Amazon instead of OpenBazaar.**
* **OpenBazaar will fail because customers will need search functions to find sellers and products and this means that OpenBazaar will compete with Google and ~every customer will use Google and therefore not OpenBazaar.**
* *OpenBazaar is 5 years away from basic functionality including basic functions that Sendcart has.*
* *OpenBazaar provides no added value over Wordpress, Shopify, etc*
* ~~Sam Patterson's article on Decentralised article is the worst article ever and terrible~~
* **Drop Zone does what OpenBazaar claims to do.**
* **OpenBazaar developers avoid answering questions by saying they have already answered questions.**

**Characteristics of a Troll via [Rationalwiki](
A troll usually has little or no interest in contributing to the development of the site in question and is interested in some or all of the following:
 * Deliberately angering people.
 * Breaking the normal flow of debate/discussion.
 * Disrupting the smooth operation of the site.
 * Deliberately being annoying for the sake of being obnoxious. For instance, using abusive names to refer to all the members on the site.
 * Pretending to be profoundly ignorant or stupid, gleaning some weird sense of having "won" when other users subsequently come to believe this.
 * Making itself the main topic of interest or discussion.[2]
**Bolded Items**
The 7 items bolded above are addressed. Note that apart from the 2 items regarding censorship, each criticism applies equally well to Drop Zone which the podcasters claim to be the exemplar decentralised marketplace. And I'll argue that even those 2 apply almost equally well to Drop Zone.
**1-2/7. Bitcoin is "uncensorable", but OpenBazaar is only "uncensored"**
The podcasters' root concern appears to be a peculiar definition of censorability as opposed to censoredness. In broad terms, they appear to draw a distinction between Bitcoin and OpenBazaar by saying that Bitcoin cannot be censored, but OpenBazaar would only remain "uncensored" in the absence of an active effort by government to censor it. Comparison is drawn with Drop Zone. I suspect because Dropzone stores its listings on the Bitcoin blockchain. 
The podcasters describe Bittorrent as uncensored, but censorable. So, it is clear that when they describe OpenBazaar as not censorship-resistant, what they mean is it is possible to censor, just as Bittorrent is.
It seems that a reasonable person would describe both Bittorrent and OpenBazaar as censorship-resistant. If the podcasters find this unacceptable, they might consider suing companies who describe their watches as waterproof.
After all, nothing is absolutely, verifiably uncensorable. Just as there are no free lunches and nothing travels faster than the speed of light. 
And, lastly, a Drop Zone listing is as censorship-resistant as its seller. And sellers are as resistant as their anonymity. A Drop Zone seller who has lost their anonymity is no more resistant than an OpenBazaar seller - and now has a permanent record of their activities in the blockchain.
**3/7. Although OpenBazaar may remove middlemen, they only do so in such a way that the value added by the middlemen is lost with no significant advantage gained.**
The essential services provided by ecommerce platforms are:
Service | Traditional | OpenBazaar
Marketing | Central, VC-funded | Word of Mouth or Aggregate of Independent Sellers
Network Effect | Result of Marketing | Result of Open Source Standardisation
Escrow | Central Database | Automated Bitcoin
Dispute Resolution | Central Staff | Open Market
Hosting | Central Server | Self or Open Market
Search | Central or Google | P2P, Open Market, or Google
Support | Staff or Site Forum | Open Source Community or Open Market
Regulatory Compliance | Jurisdictional | Self or Hosted/Jurisdictional
Payment Processing | Credit Cards (or Bitcoin processor) | Bitcoin
**4/7. OpenBazaar will fail because it competes with Amazon and ~every customer will use Amazon instead of OpenBazaar.**
This claim is easily addressed. 1) an open source protocol doesn't *fail* in the same sense that a business can. As long as n &gt;= 2 peers are connected, it's working. 2) If we define success as obtaining a market niche, then let's say we need 1,000,000 users. That's 1.42e-4 of the world's current population to have a particular set of preferences such that OpenBazaar meets their needs as well as or better than other services. 
Next, let's consider the fact that of the 7 billion people alive today, [2 billion do not have bank accounts and 40% of them live in China, India, and Indonesia.](
Suddenly, success looks like a trickle of the world's ocean of trade.
**5/7. OpenBazaar will fail because customers will need search functions to find sellers and products and this means that OpenBazaar will compete with Google and ~every customer will use Google and therefore not OpenBazaar.**
OpenBazaar sellers will be searchable in much the same as torrents are searchable. There will be p2p search and standard website listings (e.g. piratebay or rather [BazaarBay]( And then, as with torrents, many people will probably find sellers just by googling what they're looking for. 
**6/7. Drop Zone does what OpenBazaar claims to do.**
Well then, what do OpenBazaar and Dropzone claim to be?
Dropzone is a solution to the problem of restricted sales in censored markets. [From the [whitepaper](
OpenBazaar is an open source project to create a decentralized network for peer to peer commerce online—using Bitcoin—that has no fees and no restrictions. [[Openbazaar blog: What is Open Bazaar?](
Dropzone claims to enable trade of restricted goods under censorship by nation-states. OpenBazaar claims to create a network that does not charge fees or restrict access or use.
A subtle difference maybe, but it's written on their labels.
**7/7. OpenBazaar developers avoid answering questions by saying they have already answered questions.**
[Here are OpenBazaar developers directly addressing criticisms in the comments of the Soundcloud linked.](
You can scroll through Reddit, [Soundcloud]( and [Twitter]( to find that he hardly, if ever, mentions OpenBazaar without a developer appearing to politely and pleasantly answer criticism. In fact, the developers appear remarkably responsive to community discussion in general.
Also note that this comment thread began with my asking &gt;"In which ways is openbazaar vulnerable to censorship? And why do these vulnerabilities trouble you?"
to which I received no reply.

No, I'm reminding you that they have been blocking segwit for months, they have been dishonest about their motives for doing so, and that it is mind-bendingly naive to think a miner that patented an exploit, put it on their firmware, and hid it from their customers wouldn't be using it or planning to.

The combination of Confidential Transactions, Tumblebit, and Lightning Network will probably produce greater practical fungibility than Monero offers. And that's just some of the short-term, known-to-work tech. And these can operate at scale, whereas Monero's on-chain ring sigs have inescapable scalability problem of requiring every node to validate that all on-chain scaling has.
Monero's cool, but Bitcoin still leads the way.

Claiming that there is a developer cartel demonstrates that you do not understand (a) what a cartel is, (b) how open source development works, (c) how protocol upgrades occur, and/or (d) people have straight up lied to you.
Any developer can propose code to the network. It doesn't need to go into or come from the repo that the core community uses. People run core because, as the largest, longest running, and most open technical community working on the bitcoin protocol they put out the best, most reliable code. The community simply proposes code. Nodes choose what to run. 
Segwit is *not* a scaling solution. It is a set of technical fixes that enable, among other things, more advanced functionality. Amazing things like Discreet Log Contracts, Lightning Network, Cross-Chain Atomic Swaps, and MAST and that's just the near horizon. The transaction throughput increase that segwit brings was added as a compromise for a vocal minority that believed transaction fees would immanently jeopardise their business models. Now the most vocal people in that group are actively blocking a throughput increase showing that for them this was never about transaction fees. 
An adversarial environment is, roughly speaking, one in which interests are competing. The miner's themselves may be perfect ladies and gentleman. However, the incentives are such that if an advantage or exploit is available the optimal strategy for each individual is to use that exploit for gain at the expense of others.
Miners cheat *all the time*. It is dangerously naive to think - and ignorant to claim - otherwise.
Satoshi Nakamoto stated that multiple implememtations would be "...a menace to network". Whoever told you they supported them lied to you.
No cartel is benign. A cartel is a misalignment of incentives between a powerful minority and a majority. For a cartel to be benign, they must actively work against their own interests.
The Bitmain and co cartel is right now, openly, without equivocation or pretense, holding the network to ransom. They aren't even pretending not to be. The protocol changes they are demanding just so happen to allow asicboost to continue and give them more power to centralise hashing power and full nodes. This is not a coincidence.
Everything you state about the core open source community is either plainly false or a politically-motivated distortion of the truth sold to you by bad actors and people genuinely misled.

I think the argument is that defining one action as spam is a subjective value judgement. Each person has their own definition of spam and no one has the authority to define spam for everyone. While I might consider bloat-happy gambling designs as spam, there may be sound business reasons for the design and plenty of happy customers. Taken to the extreme, someone might derive a profound pleasure from watching dust transactions branch through complex and intricate routes through the network. 
The argument usually goes further to state that the only objective mesure of spam is what miner's choose to accept or reject. Miner's decide what transactions to accept by judging if the transaction fairly compensates them. 
My guess is that the concept of spam doesn't apply usefully to Bitcoin. So, a useful definition of what is commonly referred to as spam, is to reframe it as any malicious transaction behaviour. But that requires knowing or inferring intent from the observed behaviour of pseudonymous parties which can be tricky

No assumptions required.
(1) There is code written. Anyone can github search it. Confidential transactions, I believe, is workin in production. Lightning network is in testing. Tumblebit is in develooment.

Compare the growth and acceptance of Bitcoin with that of Bittorrent. Bitcoin has the great advantage of being a promise of greater wealth. That is something that those who've attacked Bittorrent since its invention can understand and can't resist.

On sale until 2140 or while stocks lasts."

Absolutely. And, in addition, Uber requires pull payments and verification of amount in wallet and charge backs.

Imagine you and everyone else each have a piece of paper. If you write something on this piece of paper, and pay a little Bitcoin, it will appear on everyone else's piece of paper too. This happens without relying on any person, company, government. And no one can stop it. Consider how powerful the possibilities are of such a system. The first use-case was to obsolete the central banks of nation-states. So what is the value of Bitcoin? It is the value of using this planetary, shared knowledge machine.

I was just pointing out that these questions would be asked, adding to the complication for non-technical people. But great explanations. I'll be stealing some of your phrasing for when I need to explain these things. thanks for taking the time.

Sorry, missed a word. Is the benefit of having BIPs for Lightning Network purely for standardisation? Or are there other issues that might come up?
I was imagining a situation where something like LN was developed without being described by BIPs or known to the core dev community and it began affecting fees. I could see this as making some development decisions trickier. Not sure if that's just a spurious thought.
