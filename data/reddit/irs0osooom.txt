I can do it in Bitcoin Core with Encrypt wallet? Is that how I create it?

Or I need to create it in some other program outside the Bitcoin Core?

I just want to see what mining is.
No intentions to buy at the moment. Just trying to figure out how its working.

Forsure it wont end with buying bitcoin

Wow,thanks for that reply.
Like i mentioned before, at the moment, I dont want to buy it. I just want to "try mining" it.
I have couple computers that I can run 24/7 with no electricity bill to pay.
So,from my picture above, I need to wait until bitcoin core will sync. After that, I will be able to create a wallet?

A. I dont really want to buy it,at least at the moment, because Im not really know how its working.
My plan is to mine it,or at least - start mining it.
The question is - right now,bitcoin core downloading some 240ish gb of something.
Do I keep it running ?
Another question - How do I start a wallet? How do I mine? Is it from the same program?

In my place I got higher machinery than a PC, thats not a problem.
My question was - how do I open a wallet? Do I need to wait for Bitcoin Core to sync and then create a wallet?

Because i have no idea how it works at first.
For example,same thing why you dont use 100% save game on a new game that you got.
I want to see how it works first.

Like I said, I dont want to buy it.
I want to try mining it.
Electricity is not a problem for me.
