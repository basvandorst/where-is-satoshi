Being a Minnesotan, yes found this to be very annoying/confusing. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:35:04
You will have your chance with a sizable dip in December is my guess.  Especially with all the futures madness that is about to go down...take advantage before we go to the moon in 2018.

Corrections coming in :(  But man is this fun, sipping coffee on a Sunday morning watching my coins rise!! (I hope).  This ain't a game for the weak and wary my friends!! HODL!

Anything is possible with bitcoin and our crazy President in office.  Best thing you can do is protect your coins.  Get a Crypto hardware wallet like a Trezor to keep your bitcoins safe no matter what.  Yeah it may seem like an expensive purchase, but could save your ass one day.

Wallet is safer

HODL or GTFO

Coinbase is a great place to start but understand it is an exchange and not a wallet.  Start with Coinbase and then move to something like Gdax or Bittrex
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:59:28
100% yes.  Understand yes the price is at an all time high but you are still very early to the party my friend.  Why not take a risk and be an early adopter on something that could potentially be worth 100k-1 million someday.   A couple hundred bucks is not going to break you, but could potentially make you a shit ton of $$!  
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:53:04
No one fucking knows.  Go with your gut.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:29:53
Nah you're gettin the ban bud. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:39:29
Only helping the cause!
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:20:46
My buddy literally sold all his Ether the day before that huge spike a week ago.  He was so pissed, but still so much $$ to be made!
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:12:10
Yepp that's how this game goes sometimes, just buy on this dip once it fully corrects!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:33:09
I think we keep seeing pretty sizable gains until the futures begin on Dec 12, then a sharp correction, until things get sorted out and people get informed...can't wait to buy on that dip.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:19:30
Yes it is completely normal, usually takes 7-9 days and could be even more backed up lately with how many newbies have entered the party.  Do not fret my friend.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:50:45
Coinbase is a great place to start but it is definitely for newbies getting their feet with.  Nothing wrong with that but just understand you are paying the high fees on bank transfers and transactions take forever, even higher fees on credit card transactions (but faster), and the app/website are constantly going down.  Not to mention you are very limited when it comes to the entire crypto world.  Like I said great place to start but after you do some research and get your feet wet look to move to a site like GDAX or Bittrex!  
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:26:19
Just doesn't want to hit 11.7 lol.  Btc you dirty dog.   
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:18:17
I think we get a decent size market correction before 12K. Definitely a few whales in Asia just bought in the game (hopefully for the right reasons).  But will be ready to buy on the dip!!  HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:16:23
Loving the Ether jump too!  Not enough people talking about Ether but get in on that game too.  So much potential. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:00:17
yeah something seems odd
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:35:19
Get a hardware wallet such as Trezor.  Extremly safe, and easy to use/monitor your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:33:11
Coinbase noob
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:21:46
Tough to say, keep checking every few hours.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:23:24
Love waking up on a Sunday morning, brewing a fresh pot of joe, and watching my coins soar.  Hope it keeps up, however I definitely see a large correction looming this month, esp with the futures roll out (if it actually happens).  I will be ready to buy on the dip before we shoot to the moon in 2018!  HODL to all.  Happy Sunday!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:27:30
dude get your virus links out of here
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:22:46
Haha only when you put $1000 on a game and your team is up 20.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:11:43
Would recommend going to Bittrex, a lot safer.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:35:45
You need to transfer your coins from an Exchange such as Coinbase to Bittrex.  Coinbase is not a bad place to start but is for as you say "newbies" and it just is not the safest platform to be storing coins on.
