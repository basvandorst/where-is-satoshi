1. If you seriously think it takes an hour to open a bank account, I can see why you are saying what you just said. 
2. Not every bank requires a SSN 
3. Credit unions don't charge to have an account. 
4. A non chase member can send money to chase members via text.
1. Searching for application 
1a. Finding reviews for applications
1b. Going over reviews for each application
2. Downloading application
3. Buy new computer, because you want your wallet to be offline
4. Oh damn, this list is getting longer and longer
1. Talk to banker
2. Hand over documentation
3. Hand over money
4. Sign paperwork
5. You now have an account
Yes, the a,b,c, etc are needed since the average person doesn't know about Bitcoin and wants to make sure they are downloading a trusted application.

May charge you,  but I don't get any monthly charges.

So I can send a text and you'll get bitcoin from me,  from my wallet that isn't online?

Proof? If we're going off no proof, I've invested over $1,000,000 in BC, and I'm freaking out! I don't see how you all are not selling!!!

Pretty easy for me and I consider myself tech savy, but I can see the difficulties for those who aren't in regards to setting up a wallet. 
Let's pull 100 random people off the street who have everything physically needed to 1. Open a bank account 2. Create a wallet 
Let's see which scenario has a higher success rate without any help from anyone who wouldn't be in the scenario. The person opening a bank account would need $25 minimum (pending which bank) and a government ID. The average person would probably get on Facebook and Instagram.

Ya, but DFW is where it is at. 
Houston is like the butthole of metroplexes in Texas.

I just send a text and I can give anyone money who has chase.  Hell of a lot easier than setting up my bitcoin wallet.  I only use bitcoin to buy low and sell high each cycle.

Please do us a favor. 
What were your sales prior to accepting BTC? 
How long did take to get your first BTC costumer after advertising you accepted it?
What are your sales after accepting BTC? (Give it a couple months) 
At the end of the couple months
What are your sales
How much of those sales are BTC vs non crypto?
Did your BTC sales increase heavily at the start then see a drastic dip?

I'm about to sleep,  just got off from work,  but if this is from their 10K which I'm assuming it is,  you guys are making a big deal out of most likely nothing.
