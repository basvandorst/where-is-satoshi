Try to use some smaller Canadian exchange, and send it to Binance. I used quadrigacx/ Coinsquare where you can fund your account with usd

40 percent of my holdings are btc and ethereum, and the other 60 percent are a bunch of alts. I divide my holdings into 3 tiers based on their market cap and volatility, bigger the market cap, more money I put on the particular coin. I started doing this around 3 weeks ago, when btc was worth 17k ish. I had 9.85 btc back then (ya I get it I took some housing money for crypto lol)and at this very moment it turned into 19.21 btc. (I have screenshots if you need proof) I mean this is probably because btc is under a correction. Yet, I do think it’s better/safer to diversify on assets/coins that you trust/believe in. I remember I saw an article somewhere, some guy tried to apply modern portfolio theory in crypto. Basically, according to his research(not saying his findings are for sure trustworthy but you should definitely take a look!), based on historical data, putting your entire portfolio on btc has the same variance/volatility as putting half of your holdings on btc and the other half in major alts. However, the latter has almost twice the yield. This is not an investment advice though, because past performance doesn’t guarantee shit lol

Yeah, bitcoin is basically the foundation of crypto market

Because most coins can only be bought through bitcoin/eth, hence their fiat value will be closely related to the value of btc

Yup you are right, active management does not beat the market, Hodling is probably the best thing one can do.
It reminds me of this article I came across couple days ago regarding active management:
