Why are you repeating yourself?
They have been caught withholding documents to spin a narrative that is utterly false. That is not up for debate. They could just as easily be doing that here.

Nice comeback.
Nothing you say is going to change how utterly illogical your post is.
"They can hack into almost anything" does not equate "Russia hacking the election was a false flag". That is the dumbest fucking thing I have ever read.

How is this big? Intelligence agencies being able to hack into anything or everything isn't new information, nor is them having the capabilities of doing so a particularly bad thing. Them using it for unjustifiable things is bad, not them being able to do it.

Wikileaks is simply pro-russia, which means they are against America. They don't give a flying fuck about political party they care about helping people who ally themselves with them and attacking anyone else.

How do you know that? We have no way to know what they are selectively withholding. For all we know they wittheld documents that conclusively proves, for example, that all of these things were simply done as tests and were never actively used. Or they could have withheld documents that conclusively proves that these things were never used for anything non-legitimate use.
We literally have no idea what kind of information they are withholding, and they have destroyed any credibility they have in that regard years ago. So we can't even trust that they are not wittholding documents.

They have been shown to be selectively release, though. Where they release only certain documents which can paint a misleading picture. They did this with their Syria leaks by withholding documents showing Russian financial ties.
