Sure, but whomever gets to use the BTC symbol on all the exchanges will seem to me to be the original Bitcoin.

Do you take dogecoin?

QR codes have always been dead. They're cumbersome and don't always work well. I never understood their adoption. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:01:01
Because sponsoring isn't doing much for the value of the coin? We should focus our efforts on accepting dogecoin for goods and services, and prompting larger companies to do the same.

The real, economics reason-- because the majority of people who have bitcoins treat them primarily as a commodity, and not a currency. Commodity prices fluctuate more wildly than currency prices.

People don't see Bitcoin as currency, they see it as an investment vehicle. It's a problem. It's too much of a meme to do away with on reddit, but "HODL" adds to that destructive reasoning. Really, everyone should be encouraging people to SPEND (not exchagne) their Bitcoin. But everyone is too scared to spend, because they're afraid they'll miss out on their chance to get rich during the next rollercoaster ride. That's not how people reason about currencies, it's how they reason about investments. Long story short, a trading conference doesn't accept stocks, why would a Bitcoin conference accept Bitcoins?

Bull-runs can be a result of either Bitcoin's deflationary nature or its speculative nature. One does not preclude the other.

I bought $100 worth of bitcoins in 2010. I sold them in 2011. Got back into the game in 2013, but only with altcoins.

BCH was great. They split and I immediately gained hundreds of $$ worth of bitcoin for every bitcoin I owned by selling all that worthless BCH.

Yes. Over the course of 8 years it grew from less than a dollar to almost $4000. Always wonder how it got there.

Mastering a skill, until we can Matrix ourselves some kung fu, is still a function of time. Can a teen make a groundbreaking app? Absolutely. Is it less likely. Yes.

Sure. I didn't clarify my situation fully. I could pay off my debt by liquidating investments, not necessarily bitcoin. If the economy enters a downward trend, I might opt to pay off debt before further investment into bitcoin or other financial vehicles. My intention is never to sell my bitcoin, but rather use it for purchase transactions. I do that now to some extent, and merchant adoption continues to increase!
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:51:37
To home in on a related point, I would say that the decision point is if you're managing your debt well or not. I have student debt. I could pay it off 100%. But as long as my investments are outperforming the amount of interest I'm paying in student loans, it doesn't make sense to resolve that debt.

I'm glad this sub hasn't turned into a total circlejerk. Bitcoin isn't guaranteed to be the future, but it can be. Mass adoption will follow education and pragmatic utility.

Oi vey... you might as well bring it to the roulette table instead.
