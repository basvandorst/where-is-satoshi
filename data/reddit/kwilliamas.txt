Grece does have the exports to balance its imports, except the imports will have to be much more modest. Remember you're talking about one of the oldest countries in the world. They have coined their own money since 700 BC and most certainly can balance their budget if they so chose. It's just easier to mooch from EU while still possible.

off-chain transactions are not only beneficial but also inevitable. Eventually bitcoin will grow into a federated system of private (off-chain) services connected together one the blockchain. You cant beat the speed &amp; efficiency of a centrally managed system for day-to-day operations.

But what did not happen is very important:
a) The loss was limited to gox investors only. No funds were collected from other people to bail gox out
b) No new bitcoins were printed
c) Gox is dead and that will leave room it's competition which has better technology and stronger ethics

My only problem with OT is that you cant have n-asset hops without all parties explicitly acting in concert. For example:
"... say I get paid in dollars but prefer to hold gold. I can place an offer to buy gold. Not only can someone take that offer because they specifically want to sell gold for dollars, but they can take that offer without even realizing it... For example, if gold is available cheaply for Euros and they have Euros, they can buy that gold, sell it me for dollars, and use those dollars to buy lunch without even realizing their transaction involved gold...This is key to Ripple because it forms an "invisible hand" that gives people what they mutually want."
This of course can be added to OT (and I hope it will) but a this point it runs orthogonal to what they have designed so far.

This problem has already been discussed (and handled) in NXT. Once you use your public key to broadcast a transaction, even if another PK is discovered that hashes to the same address, it will be ignored as the address has already "been claimed". So the moment your first transaction makes it into the chain, other key pairs don't matter anymore

In an open market environment, a currency system will evolve that bets serves the need of the market. History had shown that it is never one single medium that fills all needs. While gold coins work best behind the city walls, out in the country a basket of eggs may have more moneyless in it that said gold coin (as it's safer to carry around, more divisible - try spiting gold coin without tools - instantly recognizable, has immediate and future utility - you can eat the eggs if there's no one to trade with and turn them into chicks if you know how)
So the market will decide what coins is best for which situation, and that will allow crypto to penetrate in more aspects of trade than fiat ever will.

Totally fair - it's like bundling airfare with life insurance - not everyone is scared to fly.
With modern technology (aka cell phone) you could set preferences directly on the payment device. Remember people, your phone is a computer which can act based on situation. Think of use cases beyond emulating a piece of plastic.
For example your phone could decide that it's unsafe to to make a transaction beyond certain amount in a particular place (GPS location) and time of day (11 PM). you could make it as paranoid (or relaxed) as you are. You don't need some central corporate entity telling you what safe for you in a "one size fits all" approach. Further such behaviors can be scripted and shared on the internet. I'd much rather follow the "payment policies" of my friends and family (or the local mayor for that matter) than Visa's

It depends on the miner. Say I'm a miner and see your transaction coming in. I have to decide if I want to add it to the next block. If transaction brings a fee - I have an incentive to add it. The bigger the fee - the higher the incentive.
I'm also in a hurry. As soon as I see one block completing, I immediately try to form the next one ASAP and start computing. The more time I have for computing - the higher the probability of me finding the best hash. Also smaller blocks travel faster trough the network, thus increasing my chance of being selected as best block.
As a miner I would also like to "teach" cheapskates to start paying so I may decide to not include free transactions on purpose.

Don't you see? What kind of peacekeeper goes abroad to shoot people or kill them with drones? Victorians would call it a soldier. And when you send soldiers abroad you are attacking - not defending. Then how can a department whose main job is sending attacking armies be called DoD? So you send an attacking army overseas to kill people without prior declaration of war and THEY are the Terrorists?
as for black, women, etc knowing their place - they sure did, together with everyone else, including white males if that's where you're aiming. Do you believe that Victorian England was some sort of white male paradise and hell for everyone else? If you do, you should probably check your sources. In Victorian society most people had their place and the lot of many was harsh. Women did the house work because this was the best work available (compared with soldering, sailing, coal mining, etc) and allowed them extra time, energy &amp; life expectancy to rear the kids.
As for people of color, they were considered backward and rightly so. When British went to Africa they found nothing but mud huts with straw roofs. All myths about "children of nature", "guardians of the earth", etc aside, these were (by European standards) the signs of backwardness. Locals were conquered and put to work (in today's language "liberated and given jobs").
Life is a competition and losers are bound to perish. Everyone knows that and Victorians would not even consider pretending otherwise. Especially after they discovered it to be an universal law of nature (Darwin called it "Survival of the fittest").

What you described above sound more like "check lock time verify"
CSV is more like I send you a coin as part of a sequence. Later I send you some more coins as part of the same sequence. The sequence is kept off chain (in the mempool), ether of us has the option to close it at any time. You only get your funds when the sequence is closed and in a single transaction (e.g. if I send you 4 payments x 0.25 each, you will see a single payment of 1 BTC) 
This is a very powerful concept as it allows creation of payment channels (think pay per view, etc) that are automatically flushed to single payment upon closure.
The concept is even more powerful. Imagine that you want to encourage me to serve your content (movie) to other people (while watching it). You could use the same payment channel to pay me back for my bandwidth costs. Again the whole thing only results in a single blockchain transaction at the end.
You can't do this kind of tricks with classic even if they go to 400 MB blocks ...

User adoption is happening, how else could you explain the steady rise of the transaction volume? It's just not the user you expect ("Average Joe"). Factor in the transaction volume of the alt-coins, and user adoption had exploded). Again maybe not with the type of user you have in mind
Exchanges are are indeed weak (compared to FOREX), however they are orders of magnitude better from what they used to be just few years ago. Also as a method of converting fiat to crypto, exchanges are already good enough. Many do take credit card payments thus further minimizing the counterparty risk. Exchanges are not substitutes for bitcoin wallets however and should not be held to the same standards. In particular they are not banks.
Whales do control the market. Any market (stock, bonds, fiat)
Mining is booming because Chinese miners are allowed to register this as "bitcoin manufacturing" with CPC (china's planning commission). As such they are allowed to "export the BTC" for dollars. In essence BTC mining in China is a way of circumventing currency controls. And there's a lot of cash that wants to leave china.
The fact that with 10% growth in M1, BTC still holds its value is a strong indicator of the systemic strength of the economy that underpins it.  And since the monetary policy is publicly known, it removes one significant risk factor from the future pricing of the coin. Unlike FOREX, where the key to success is second guessing the intent of its respective central bank &amp; cleptocratic gang also known as political elite
Finally, on the user base. There's a number of smart people for whom using fiat is harder than using bitcoin.  It's usually due to the nature of their activities or/and moral values (*I for one believe that transacting in fiat promotes war and theft.*). So the question is how many of those folks are around, and what's their economic output. If we take the (very conservative) assumption of 250,000 world wide (Coinbase alone has 2M users), then you're talking of the population of a mid-sized town. In this town, most everyone has a college degree with many holding advanced degrees in math and science. There's a strong sense of belonging, resembling a religious cult complete with a mythical founder (SN) and his (living) disciples. So (*based on per capita income of Boston and Salt Lake City*) this town's gross income would be around $25K*$250K=$6B .... which kind of nicely correlates with the current BTC market cap

 your example seems to describe the monetary phenomenon of inflation. A life is always a life. How much $ will be assigned to it depends on the total money in circulation. When more money's available (aka throwing Gates in the pit) the market will quickly adjust to account for that. Ergo the (rational market) bum will likely (trough a series of "wait a minute" situations) up the price until he extracts Bill's total net worth as ransom. Which is another way of saying that life is worth all the money you have.
As for large investors buying off-chain (from miners) - that makes little sense because it implies the miners get to hold the coin (on the blocks they've mined) and at the same time selling it (in the form of IOU) for millions of $. There could be an entity out there that hoards BTC and then trades them in the form of warehouse receipts, but again that entity must be a full reserve, so it's undistinguishable from the rest of the market players.
Finally, no one (no mater how wealthy) can buy all the bitcoin from all the exchanges. The moment they start, the price will spike and will continue to rise until it matches their net worth. Just like with the Gates in the pit...

After a century of unchallenged growth, the New York elites are finally starting to get concerned about the possible rise of another genuine source of wealth AND power within the US.
Other places have been allowed to get wealthy as long as they don's move in the power play. Eventually this leads all money back to NY where they are "managed" &amp; "protected from political whims" for a price. This also gives NY the unique option of shaping up Washington's policy (for the purposes of this opinion they are the same entity) while a the same time offering itself as a policy tool (for a fee). For all intents and purposes, NY institutions are acting like agents of the state and enjoying the benefits of such activities at the taxpayer's expense.
The emergence of a system that does not channel its profits trough NYSE and is capable of reaching people / shaping opinions outside the mass media (controlled by you know who) is considered a thread "to established rules and norms"
The article ends with a thinly veiled threat that the rules will be changed soon to bring the new players back in line.
I have no doubts it will be tried, however I also think everyone will be nasty surprised how deep of a rift it will open in the global (not only US) society. And when it opens, people will be picking sides - the rich, the poor, the white, the ne**o, the religious and the atheist, the muslim and the christian. Pretty much anyone these days is deeply dissatisfied with the system, except for the minority governing elites. You'd be surprised how quickly their voices will be drowned once the uproar starts. 
The questions is not so much whether current governance conundrums are truly solvable trough technology means but rather whether such approach sounds plausible to enough people. Because if enough people start believing they could achieve better governance trough software improvements, it would empower the geeks to such extent that they could decide to openly challenge the old elites (rather than wait for "slavery to die down on its own"). The ensuing conflict would be one that humanity would be lucky to survive.

Spam or not - it's usage hence adoption. Spam email is also email. And spam goes where the value is.
Being worth something counts as holding a value. Going from 0 to 1000 was a spectacular move, Retreating back to 200 (or 20 to that matter) still counts as holding value (*compared to Lehman Brothers on Enron stocks*). Naturally you cannot expect an entity underpinned only by market to have the short term moves of a "government backed" (aka taxpayer funded) scheme. Give me control over IRS, NSA, DoD and the printing presses and I could "stabilize" the short term price of Bitcoin (or anything else) at practically any level. The problem is that such stability will cost enormous amounts on money as all my goons (*and their friends*) will be living the good life at taxpayer's expense.
There will always be war. The more funding goes into it - the more of it there will be. And by theft I did not meant the debasement of fiats (*that I consider part of the tax code, but this is whole new topic*) I mean the simple fact of being able to produce money out of your pocket and claim them as yours promotes theft at all levels - people get mugged, robbed and so fourth. IMHO in a perfect world, every cent one owns should be publicly traceable to a legitimate source. This applies for governments, corporations and individuals. I'm totally willing to put all my wealth out there for the world to see, on a condition that my boss, ny company and my government does the same.

Good article, the author recognizes the fact of large private lenders (e.g. pension and insurance funds) being (de facto) government agents.
Unfortunately he embraces solutions based on current status quo, urging said actors to base investment decisions to the larger concept of common good (which author understand as "minimize greek suffering").
This is the typical progressive narrative where markets and capital are imbued with social functions, which they are expected to fulfill (by acting selfishly) in the name of the common good - an activity that is far easier simulated than than executed (hence the large PR and legal departments in all modern corporations)

ATM applied to bitcoin is no more misleading than "Automatic" applied to "Teller Machine"
Do you know of Manual Teller Machines? And is there a teller in the machine? For example (according to wikipedia, a teller could "issue business referrals (trust, insurance, lending, etc.)". When was the last time you got one of these from an ATM?
Long story short, like ATM exploits the "Teller" analogy to make it easier for people to understand what it does, a Bitcoin ATM (ot BTM) could (and should) rely on the ATM analogy to make it easier for people to understand what it does.
If Bitcoin is money, having a vending machine for it would be highly confusing. Imagine next time you visit EU, there's the ATM's (for EU bank customers) and also "EUR vending machines" for USD holders ... and they look mostly the same ... wont that be confusing ?!?

Applied to BTC however it's a sure sign of demise :-). Or maybe you expect it to go viral and double every 6 months? Given the current state of technology - it's clearly impossible. The first viral app was email and it only went viral when enough people had PC's and the technology had proven itself in the field. IMHO same goes for blockchain money. There will be no viral adoption until wallets proliferate and mobile payments become ubiquitous. Until then BTC will just linger, doubling every few years or so...

Eventually it will. Luckily, there are solutions for when that happens. For example we can have a second genesis block which will be nothing more than a full list of all non-zero outputs at a given height. Once that's agreed upon (trough version propagation consensus), all future "full chain" downloads will start form that block, rather than from block zero. There're other solutions too, but I suspect core devs will continue to kick the can down the road until the chain reaches few TB (the size of a modern hard drive)

The article is a marketing shill. The idea of crypto-currency (or crypto-anythng)  is very simple: To control the entity you must know the (private) key.
Blockchain or not - it's not that important. Calling a modern bank account crypto cash is nonsense. For example a number of people can close your bank account without any consent from you. They could also take money from it, etc. So it is a first and foremost a liberty issue (hence the libertarian roots of bitcoin)
Ultimately however, crypto empowers automatons (computers, robots, drones, software apps) to have their own "bank accounts" and participate in the economy together with humans. So you (a human) could work for a machine and get paid by it. For example a "wealthy" (self driving) taxi cab can stop by a human-operated body shop, get it's repairs done and pay the owner directly. Think about the possibilities...

?!? 
Nonsense I say! The education system is ran by women. Right now, there are 5% male teachers in kindergarden, 9% in elementary school and 14% in high school. (source: MenTeach.org). You say those female teachers (including math and science) tend to discourage girls from becoming like them?
The women mathematicians of old were a product of a different system, many coming from prominent families and attending private schools for girls (where math &amp; science were usually taught by men). They also were not that many in proportion to men (as the article may lead you into believing).
The western world experienced sharp boom in science and technology from mid-19th to late-20th centuries. During that time participation of both genders in science &amp; research increased notably. Still, women's participation was but a blip compared to men's. Now that the tide is fading, men will drop significantly and women will all but disappear.
And without trying to stir the whole nature vs nurture debate, part of the reason for this decline lies in schools. Schools nowadays teach safety, compliance and distribute free meals. They also spend countless of hours on social studies, drama, etc. There's no running, pushing or screaming. It's one large group of kumbaya singers where everyone is a winner. Most girls thrive in such environment. Most boys hate it (or having absorbed the role of a female role model) turn into soft gay-like slobs upon graduation.

All these bills &amp; deals struck between big money (insurance, banking) and big lie (government)  – you like they mean something to us? Yes' we don's openly dissent and pretend to play along to avoid trouble with the law - but we wont fight to save them ether. So when time comes and this (or any) country turns into Iraq in the course of 3 weeks - don't expect much support form us. Then we'll see how much this  “insurance company with a big army” is really worth. 
Bitcoin is better because it does not depend on legions of armed goons and lying crooks to stay alive.
And finally. In a previous article you say gold is a hedge against failure of central banks. My friend (sorry, patronizing again) the central banks had already failed. They fail by succeeding in keeping up a corrupt system. The best case scenario (for them) is riding this bitch all the way down. A more optimistic (for us) would be a limited (monetary) revolt and bringing equity back to where it's sorely needed. I for one hope central banks can be eliminated using a combination of political and technological means.

Don't deal with nervous people. Fiat holders should hand cash first. BTC is the scarce commodity here, so no scans until cash is in your pocket. That's how hookers operate, learn from them. The customer WANTS what you offer, so they have to play by your rules. Be upfront about that, let them know what to expect. 
Once you scan that QR - it's gone and not coming back. The cash holder can scream, drag you to the police, pull cash back from your pocket, etc. You cant do that with BTC.
There's got to be a minimum level of trust and good manners involved in every deal
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:24:01
Dude, unless you operate with thousands of dollars, one confirmation is more than enough. For amounts of less than $10, the mere receiving of a well formed transaction (One with the right amount and non-zero txn fee) is enough
Remember, buyers have no way of retracting broadcasted transactions and the network will not propagate bogus transactions (double spends, overdrafts, etc)
The only trick I know to send invalid transaction is to make it 0 fee and hope pools will not include it into blocks in the next 24 hours so it expires from the mem pool without causing a spend. However even then my chances are slim because many pool confirm 0 fee transactions pro bono

Put 10% of what you have in BTC
Worst case scenario the price had peaked and is moving sideways for few years. Plenty of time for you to exit.
If you believe it can go to 0 in 10 days - run away now - this game is not for you. Bitcoin is known to have 80% flash crashes, newbs panic and sell all and it then recovers. Write off your investment the moment you buy in. That's the only sane way of doing this

I’ve survived hyperinflation in the soviet bloc back in the 90 ties, and here’s a practical advice. When USD becomes scarce – the game is up, it’s too late &amp; dangerous for you to buy large on black market. If you do -  information will leak and thugs will come to visit.  They kidnap/torture/kill you to get a hand of your “undeclared wealth”, and police wont protect you (because you’re criminal too and they work with the thugs)
This late in the game, you setup a recycling business ASAP and start buying metal scrap (preferably copper), here’s why:
Copper scrap is highly liquid; currently it fetches $7K/tone on international markets. A tone of copper is about the size of a large suitcase (when melted).
Several tones of copper are hard to steal (you need a crane &amp; a truck to load them on) + thugs look upon it with disdain (looks like dirty scrap). It can be stored in a hole or in basement / barn / warehouse
At this stage, your industry is probably collapsing so local prices of copper will drop as machines are sold for scrap. So you get to buy on the cheap (while the opposite is going on with USD, gold &amp; silver).

brutality and capital are not necessarily linked. In fact poverty has been known to produce equal or exceeding amounts of violence. In my opinion poverty is violent more often but with less effect (lack of means and know how). Capital is rarely violent but more effective. To total net impact however of poor vs rich violence is about equal.
The Victorian Society had many things right. One of them was the notion of honor &amp; personal responsibility. It also would not shy away of recognizing the natural differences between genders, races and cultures. The generals would report to the ministry of war, etc, etc.
Today we mostly believe that by not saying certain things, we somehow make them disappear. Or just say the exact oposite of what we do. For example DoD is sending peacekeepers abroad to help foreign countries in their fight with terrorism. Known terrorists are taken out by drones, with occasional collateral damage (their families), etc ,etc

Does not matter much who makes the rules - it maters more who applies them. Imagine a supposedly male-dominated body decides to have gun club in every school. By the time it gets implemented by the Mrs'ses (there I've coined a new word) all the guns will be safely stored in a lock box and the emphasis will be on gun safety. Pupils will be writing essays on "the day I would fire my first shot" and "how I felt after holding an empty gun for the first time", etc, etc ... where naturally girls will exceed. Until war breaks out and you need to actually shoot to kill. Then your advanced civilization sends its "well trained" women to war where most of them get killed. No girls == no babies and the lie ends there. Example may seem exaggerated but illustrates my point. 
Edit: Now we are all intelligent here and it should go without saying that we talk about the average person. Sure there are top achievers amongst women who dwarf 99% of male population in science, tech, etc, etc. If I have to state this obvious point, it's already a sign of a deteriorating discussion

1. Get a cheap laptop (second hand ok), cover it's network jack with tape, disable the wireless.
2. Reinstall the OS. Chose strong password, enable disk encryption.
3. Install your favorite wallet from a USB stick. (no network!)
4. Hook a usb printer (no network!) and print public address on paper. Make several copies with QR code, etc. Hand over to people so they can send you money.
5. Print your private key on a separate sheet of paper (use OCR-frendly font). Seal in an envelope &amp; store in a vault. Only open if laptop is lost or stolen.
6. Unhook the printer, power off the laptop, keep it on a reasonably secure location.
7. Deposit bitcoins to public address. 
Note: if you are extremely paranoid, never spend money out of that wallet or sign messages with it until time comes to cash it all out. This way the network will never know your public key, which adds extra level of security in case you believe qantum computers (if ever built) could crack NSA's eliptic curves.

It does not. Electrum servers are extremely dumb – they only relay pieces of block chain data between client &amp; network. They do not access or store your key in any way, shape or form – so you lose the key – you’re done for.
On the flip side even if all electrum servers in the world are hacked, your cash is still secure.
One more thing – Electrum is a project name. They just write the code, they don’t own or operate any servers. Random enthusiasts from around the world download the software and run the servers on their own hardware.

Deflationary is not bad. Deflationary currency makes all sense for buying valuable stuff (food, house, car, gold, etc). You cooked a good meal, it has value - why selling for fiat junk? A house starts bringing value the moment you buy it (you now have a place to live). Why sell for fiat junk? A car is much the same (you can now reach more places). Only cheap plastic junk and mindless entertainment are the ones worth any fiat (because they lose value over time just like fiat does, so it's fair trade).

At todays prices 300 TB storage costs between $15K - $30K and thats for handling the needs of the **entire globe** for a year. Your average small town credit union spends that much for IT in a month. That gives you an idea of the improvement scale we are talking about.
The current block-chain storage format relies on the so called merkel trees, which makes it possible for light clients (such as electrum and multibit) to fetch data limited to certain address(es). The process is very efficient and only takes seconds.
The dev team has been thinking about those from day 1, here's a link for future reading

Thanks for the good article. I have not tough about it from this angle. Indeed to privatize commons, you may want to ensure socialism is perceived as a failure or/and a threat. That’s a hard sell in cohesive nation. Enter foreign moochers.. What you get is
* Nation no longer cohesive
* Socialism no longer economically viable 
* Socialism perceived as the problem by most. Some want it gone to discourage more moochers coming. Others want it dismantled to secure few more payments from the sale of state assets.
* Sell, take profit &amp; retire in exclusive mansion with private security

Also bitcoin being a payment network issues receipts to payers, so all you need from a client is his receipt number (aka transaction id) and you can tell how much he sent you, when, etc. A great way to keep your books in order in the long run. You can even issues refunds to people not completely satisfied (pun intended)

Here are my rules:
* Get their cell phone and call. Explain your rules and propose a meeting place (coffee shop, mall, etc)
* Dress well, speak softly dont deviate from rules, refuse deal if customer makes you nervous
* Sit at the table, ask for cash first, count it and put at your side of the table
* Publish the transaction. If customer brings live wallet (most of the time) ask him to keep the phone on the table until it gets notification.
* Put the money in your pocket and tell buyer they can have the phone back.
* Sit calmly at the table until first confirmation. After that ask buyer if they are satisfied with the transaction and if they want to wait for 2 more confirmations
* Go home
It's important to explain what you are doing ahead of time and make your intentions clear. If buyer is too nervous or try to distract you while handling money / QR codes - ask them to please be quiet while you do critical tasks. If buyer does not comply - cancel the deal.

That's true but also irrelevant. Paypal makes its revenue by charging a transaction fee. They could not care less whether transactions between paypal accounts are for goods &amp; services, political donations, charity or otherwise.
So if bitcoin moves the same volume - it should be valued similarly. If I have the potential to disrupt Google for example, my market cap is similar to theirs. Even if I cant capture the revenue stream I'm taking away from them, the fact that I could do it makes me market player of the same caliber.

A buddy of mine started this to preserve wealth (I admit the idea is not mine). He also ran a chicken farm, the copper scrap was dumped in one corner and was the favorite place for chickens to poop on. No one would think it valuable. Thugs came after his business and eventually burned the warehouse down. He went bankrupt and no one looked at his recycling biz books (few $ given to the right official also helped). The fella started selling used appliances at the town market and was really sloppy at cleaning the burn site. Few years later there was a real estate boom. He indicated what was under the rubble, some people came to visit and paid about 5x above market for that property. He also got shares in their enterprise (shrewd folks always in demand). Last time I've head form him he was moving money to Cyprus :-)

Use coinbase for merchants. There's a Subway in PA, that's already using it. Details: 
When setup correctly, a QR code will printed on the bill (first receipt). If they chose to pay with bitcoin, all they have to do is scan the QR code with their cell phone &amp; post the transaction. You then take the bill back to POS terminal and wait for transaction to show up. Once that happens, it will print a receipt for you to bring back to customer.

Second that. The chain is a settlement mechanism - not a real time payment one. Expect businesses to grow around the chain that provide just that (btw no chain can scale that much, even ripple's consensus ledger has 20 sec lag. In contrast a modern HFT platform does sub-millisecond trades).
What the chain allows you to do is settle with any partner within 10 minutes (for a cost of ~1%) in a non-disputable way. It may not seem like much to you but from business standpoint this is huge! It's like the Bible printed for the first time - now people can read God's words themselves (instead of relying on a priest). This will bring out questions, ideas and reformation on huge scale ...

I lived in former soviet bloc countries in the 90ties. There was inflation everywhere without exception (ranges 20% to 100% annually depending oc country). Ordinary people got decimated, their savings gone, salaries reduced to pittance. Demand dropped, unemployment ensued. It became virtually impossible to get credit (how would an unemployed person with no savings repay a 25% APR credit)?  Crooks organized as “investment trusts” would get large loans for industrial development but instead use them to buy hard currency (development too risky). Often they would team up with corrupted bank managers. When bets did not turn the right way - they would simply default on the loan or settle for 50 % of the original amount keeping the hard currency profits to themselves. Needles to say for them the inflation was never enough, so they would lobby the gov for more money to help “investors”. Gov was only happy to oblige. Ordinary people were quick to follow. Eventually FOREX markets (official &amp; illegal) became bigger than stocks, bond and estate combined. Now ordinary people would also hope that inflation continues so their “investments” would grow too. To skip conversion costs, large companies started settling in FOREX and eventually supermarkets started quoting certain import items directly in USD. Government tried to legislate that and a black market for TV’s and dishwashers ensued. I can continue to enumerate the benefits of currency inflation on and on. But let me not spoil it for you. You are about to discover it yourselves. When the whole thing ended, a small group of people were in power and were owning 90% of the country. That group appeared to be different than the pre-inflation elite, so yes, its all about changes in power.

MrMadden, you’re generally right but keep in mind the chain and the ledger are essentially two different things. The ledger is the current state of all non-zero accounts. The chain is the recorded history of how we got there. Ultimately it’s the ledger that matters and it’s far smaller than the chain. With 32 bytes per record (address + balance) you can store 1bn records in 32 GB RAM. If bitcoin enthusiasts can afford $10K for an ASIC, they could certainly pony up few hindered bucks for a dedicated machine with extra ram few years from now. That’s all you need for being able to validate &amp; propagate transactions for 1bn+ customer base. Your dumbed down client will be throwing away block as soon as they are validated and only retaining most recent state of the ledger. Should it ever go out of sync it can reach out to one of the genesis nodes on the cloud &amp; rebuild itself back.
Also there will be off chain transactions. Just like in TCP most devices are on local networks and exchange data that never goes to the internet (think of your home network for a second), same will happen with Bitcoin. Large payment networks will settle off chain (to avoid paying miner fees) and the chain will be used only when moving funds from one payment system to another (like from Coinbase to BitPal)

Kill Bitcoin? Government and Banks will love Bitcoin! It’s perfect system for wealth extraction.
Once all transactions become public a global sales (or transaction tax) will be implemented. World Bank has been advocating it for years. Imagine the problems it solves: No more capital flight, no more untaxed revenue, no more currency wars, no need for AIM and KYC laws.
Gov will nationalize mining (for common good) and implement global sales/transaction tax on the block chain. In return it will scrap local tax codes (which we'll all cheer - no more filing yay!!!). 
With its taxing power 100% guaranteed, Gov will turn to commercial banks &amp; borrow to it's hearth desire. Banks will be only happy to oblige until tax revenue matches debt payments.
And so we’ll be back where we are. Gov does the dirty work of organizing elections, waging wars, collecting taxes and getting lynched every 150 years or so. The real proceeds go to the bank people, which are never elected and tend to have affiliation to a certain ME country.

In USA, the FED requires banks to have 3% of the money they hold in deposit. Source: 
The rest of the money are "invested" in loans, securities, etc. If 3% of depositors would to withdraw, banks would have to call on loans and fire-sale assets to raise capital. Which of course would cause the prices of said assets to plummet &amp; bank go bankrupt.
Enter the FED, which prints money to recapitalize the banks during crisis so they could continue to invest in "innovative" financial products.
And when FED prints, we all pay the price ... except for the banks - they collect the bonuses.

**Bitcoin gets you the benefits of a cash transaction AND the convenience of an electronic payment.**
QR payments are so unbelievably easy that it has to be seen to be believed. Also once you have customer’s BTC address on record you can offer loyalty incentives (promotions, discounts, sweepstakes, etc). You can allow customers to withdraw their remaining funds (or automatically credit their BTC accounts upon 90 days of inactivity). In short now you have a way to reach your customers after the purchase and make them come back for more.
Being able to distinguish individual customers is huge. It allows you to learn their preferences, offer recommendations and more, while still allowing for the customer to remain anonymous.
Also when the new BIP70 feature comes online (somewhere next year), you will be able to issue electronic receipts with links to your merchant website.  That would drive even more traffic to your online properties as customers visit to check their purchase history. It's an opportunity for you to sell even more. Plus customers can "like" your machines on facebook and yes, your machines could interact with the web directly (for example by tweeting out when new snacks arrive)
Bitcoin will change the wending business like the internet changed publishing. Sure there still be machines selling stuff on location, but there will be a vast array of other services consumed through other means. For example you can be renting discounted movies to people who buy certain snacks, you can sell Amazon &amp; eBay gift cards, etc, etc.
Think what Amazon did to publishing thanks to the web. You can do the same to vending thanks to bitcoin. Think big!

In a nutshell, Bitcoin is peer to peer payment system with no middle man. In this system payments are made with a unit also called Bitcoin.

Maybe followed by a new type of war.

I agree in principle. Gold kicks ass. It's more p2p than bitcoin (transacting gold does not require superficial internet network between buyers and sellers), survives EMP blasts and can be used off grid. Having gold is survivalists ultimate dream.  However in all other but most extreme of circumstances these advantages are negated by it's weight. Because of that, gold does not travel well. Has to be carefully inspected each time it switches hands and then stored in a steel vault underground protected with armed guards (for large quantities).
In a world of electronic assets changing hands with the speed of light (over FO cables), gold simply cant keep up. The best you can hope for is some sort of gold-backed electronic claim which can match the speed of commerce.
Unfortunately all attempts to devise gold-backed currencies have failed in the same way: centralization, over-issuance, debasement, war, inflation, collapse

Gold and silver look like poor money now but they were best of breed up to 80 years ago (when people still exchanged goods at the towns's market). Gold and silver's only current disadvantage is inability to travel over FO cables.
Will people be able to subvert Gov's attempt to monopolize money? I hope so, but for them to stand a chance there must be no global Gov (as you correctly point out).
However my bet is that forces that be will form a global alliance in order to preserve their awesome powers. My only hope is it happens peacefully. Otherwise we'll see an Earth-shattering war the likes of which are hard to imagine.

They may keep 80K in a deep cold wallet in real safe where only CFO has access. Another 15K may be kept in a semi-cold wallet (a laptop that's powered off most of the time and only accessible to few people at certain times of day). Finally 5K may be on a hot wallet fully wired to the network. This is where automated withdrawals come from.
So exchanges are also giant mixers and if they don't comply with US fed, good luck figuring out who earned what.

There's also something deeper at play here. You are a boy and our schools are shaped &amp; controlled by women.
They are all about friendship, harmony, safety and ability to endlessly reiterate on an existing subject. For them intelligence is measured by the ability to use different words for describing the same thing over and over again. 
You as a boy are about doing, challenging, exploring, tinkering and innovating. And that its normal. That's the way you should insist on going regardless the opposition. Ask yourself this question - if girls do so great at schools, how come most of the greatest inventions are made by men? Look on these forums - I can guarantee you 90% of the people here are male.
So don't look for understanding at school - it's a lie. Talk to your Dad, your uncles &amp; brothers. Go to an online gaming community, the army, the sports club - that's where your role models are.
Your teacher is not bad or evil -she's just incapable of understanding the challenge and it makes her scared &amp; confused.

Do the checking – savings account thing. Put 80% of your money in savings (that’s your paper wallet) 20 in checking (hot wallet). Spend from checking.
When you need to transfer from savings to checking, simply import the private key from the paper wallet to your hot wallet.
Also instead of having one paper wallet with 80%, do 10 paper wallets for 8% each and use them like CD’s (cash out one at a time as needed) Less convenient but more secure.

I’m still amazed how the so called mainstream continues to paint us libertarians as fringe &amp; wackos.  Liberty is an idea so basic that it comes right after the primal instincts. It will never be extinguished. Trading liberty for “safety &amp; security” had never worked in a long run. When the concept of a free decentralized society based on mutual respect and self-reliance is perceived as anti-state, the later has to be carefully examined for political malformations.
There are more of us at all levels of state &amp; society that we dare think possible. We just don't always speak up from fear of being marginalized and ridiculed by progressive or/and conservative elements. Unfortunately both parties are anti-freedom - they only differ in opinion as to which areas should state coercion be exercised first.

The technology is called "decentralized crypto currency" bitcoin is the forerunner but there are others. BTC miners are custodians of an important part of the network. If the turn into bad actor, another crypto will rise to replace it.
Centralized bodies are not inherently bad. They only turn bad when given unchecked powers. The power of BTC mining pools is checked by the open source protocol and free market. Given their vast stake in the system, pools are more likely to acti n a very constructive manner and promote the very principles that make their network thrive. Kind of like the US gov in the first 50 years of its existence

For experiment's sake you can try mining at two pools at once in a load balanced mode (if your miner supports it).
Educate yourself on pool reward systems (PPS vs PPLNS vs DGM, etc). Understand variance. You'll have a lot of fun.
Most major pools wont accept CPU miners because they tie more server power than it's worth. Experiment with p2p pool &amp; eligius. Also recommending eclipse - a good pool with straightforward interface.
Then I maybe consider mining altcoins

Be careful there's a difference between backed and redeemable. The dollar has always been backed by the industrial output of USA. You want a piece of that output - you need $$$. In addition it was redeemable for government silver - you could get silver from gov, no market involved, no questions asked.
Bitcoin is backed by the utility of the bitcoin network just like an iPhone is backed by the utility of its ecosystem. An iPhone without network is worthless.
Bitcoin will never bee redeemable for gov assets. If recognizedas currency however it will be convertible to any major asset, including gold and silver on the open market.

Instruct people when they make payments to also send you the transaction ID's as proof of payment. This way you can track who paid how much and when.

From financial type’s prospective and adopting “Bitcoin is a virtual currency / commodity “ stance, things look exactly right. Scratch the surface and look at the protocol and its possible applications – and it’s a whole new game.
Analysts don’t have a good method for valuing crypto because such thing had not existed before. So they use familiar analogies.  Like IBM trying to figure the demand for computers shortly after the first one was built (during the WW2 to crack German codes):
'I think there is a world market for about five computers' —Mr Thomas J. Watson (Chairman of the Board - IBM), 1943
And he was right to think that way. Computers main use was for war (now: "defense").  5 world powers -&gt; 5 computers. So people aint necessarily stupid (now: "special needs") – it’s just sometimes hard to imagine stuff.

I second that - Gov can ban bitcoin, but I think they wont - they'l just subvert it and use it for their purposes. For example Gov could ban Internet, bu instead they use it to collect information on us much more effectively now since we enter it ourselves &amp; maintain it up to date free of charge.
When properly subverted, BTC can be turned into the ultimate tax collection tool with global reach. What could be better?
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:53:01
Nada - I understand it very well. If Gov nationalizes mining, you will pay your tax in order to have the transaction added to a block. It will be small amount but it will be inescapable.
The gov will nationalize mining. Will they do it by building ASIC's, by regulation (making it a monopoly) or some other creative means - that I don't know. But it will happen
FYI the word dollar comes from the german taller which was a measure of silver with guaranteed purity and weight (widely accepted). It was made in a private mints, completely unregulated. In 250 years, Gov had subverted the idea so match that we still use the dollar - but it means a completely different thing. Same will happen with bitcoin (if it succeeds to become widely accepted) 
Also the Gov inflates in attempt to postpone the moment of lynching and blur the responsibility. Since we all got more money to spend, we all benefited - so it must be everyone's fault... That's the main goal of the "wealth effect". 
The true wealth is however measured in personal time &amp; freedom. And we all have less and less of that, whereas selected few have more &amp; more.

Untold millions of people are trading their wealth, labor &amp; leisure for access to these ideas. None of these ideas has "intrinsic value".
