I think you are misunderstanding the thinking behind lightning. It’s not some get rich quick scheme. I don’t believe it’s going to get anywhere near it’s ATH just because of a network.

Sure, they embody what we WANT to be. But very, very few of us would do this, given the opportunity.

I’m telling you Coinbase owns those coins. They aren’t yours. They are insured for THEM. Even on their website they basically call you a moron if you store large amounts on Coinbase.

How would you feel about donating to the cause of getting my car fixed? Haha! Kidding this is an awesome thing you’re doing, my man :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:31:55
It will certainly take a while to watch them all, as time has never been my friend, but I will try my hardest to understand! :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:13:52
Haha wow you sound like a massive douchebag. And your last comment says you’re a noob to crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:13:23
Uhhh no, it’s dipping. Now is the time to buy, baby.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:51:47
Without that 99% if investors, bitcoin would have died before it began.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:46:13
You claim to have 6 figures in crypto despite being a bitcoin noob. I feel really bad for you, your life must be absolutely pitiful to have to lie on the internet to make yourself feel better. Pretty sad. Also you bragging about making more money than he does proves to me that you’re not only a liar, but an impotent child.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:17:01
Welders don’t make good money by default lol. Programmers generally make good money but there are still ones who don’t. I’m just making conversation right now, not lamenting.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:47:44
Ah that is a pretty nice setup you’ve got going there! Living at home I feel would be great. I’m a 24 yr old welder in Cleveland making ends meet so it’s definitely a difference of circumstance! Ive had my share of luck in the past, and I’m glad you see are fortunate! Awareness of that makes everything easier as a community. Although I do wish I hopped on this crypto currency bandwagon a bit earlier...
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:50:35
You know those numbers are meaningless when it comes to actual gains of an individual. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:01:30
I’ve never done any coding so it seems like the explanations may need explanations, but if it helps me pay my bills and feed my family, I’m ready to learn! :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:57:00
Do you remember the point you’re trying to argue? No one has said that the long game isn’t the game you’re supposed to play. I have explicitly agreed with that, actually. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:08:29
You are missing the point entirely, thinking people are mad because it’s a “stupid coin”. Go ahead and do some reading before replying.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:40:14
I wish I could just write off $20 :p I’m a full time student/full time work, so most of my money goes to an account holding my student loan repayments, prepping for 6 months after graduation. I had to pull a side job to get that $20 haha. But you’re not wrong, it probably wouldn’t kill me to lose $20. However it does mean I would going hungry for two nights.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:04:06
You just straight up got caught lying bud. Just leave.

He who controls the keys, controls the coins.

If it wasn’t bitcoin it would have just been another crypto. There’s no longer anything social about it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:17:54
What is the consequence I’m not seeing? I’m seeking to understand my investments, and I haven’t seen any due repercussion, so there’s no “this is why...” scenario.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:10:35
Haha please do I will happily buy it
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:46:00
Oh hey I know some of those words!
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:21:04
Hehe thanks friend :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:57:53
No this is what greedy insiders look like
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:41:44
Haha okay move somewhere else where you don’t have to pay taxes, jackass. We’re better off without leeches.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:07:22
It’s not hard to understand how those two numbers are entirely irrelevant. The people who lost money DIDNT hold til today, otherwise they would not have lost money. It’s the daily fluctuations of +/- 20% in value where people lose money. They see a fifth of their money go out the window and sell at a loss, thinking “at least I can get my initial investment”. Then they’re hit with fees, a change in price, and after they’ve sold, the price went back up 20%. Now, they still want a small stake in crypto so they buy some more thinking “I’ll hold this time...” rinse and repeat. I mean, I’m a holder of ETH and LTC, but i just do it for fun. I’d like to see how far $200 will take me, and that’s pretty much it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:51:32
Oh my sweet summer child...
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:02:16
Damn... I’ve only got $20 in my bitcoin wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:05:22
Everyone did. Coinbase made out like bandits.

Driving on the roads I help pay for, calling the police I help employ, using the teachers that I helped unionize, are those theft too?

I was about to thank you for the resource before I even watched the link haha.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:34:39
I just don’t have money for gifts, I was just hoping to turn this into $100 or so in order to afford them. But thank you for your advice!
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:29:55
I mean...I buy $20 a week.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:00:55
And equally worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:59:49
Are you trying to boast about your investment or are you telling us you put a worrying amount of money into crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:56:01
Jesus dude just read this thread. People are upset because the only reason it’s there in the first place was so that Coinbase insiders could buy it before it went live, then sell it for massive profit immediately after release. Like this doesn’t take wisdom, just reading.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:16:41
He’s a moron for showing people how much money he has. How the fuck is that so hard to grasp?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:32:09
That’d be great! Thank you :)

Here’s a tip: none of us are worth listening to.
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:45:27
I’m certain it was a joke, as the spoon has been around much longer than the patent office.
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:43:26
Wow we really do live in a society
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:17:28
What makes this funny is the fact that this was all in the face of a real fire that Dwight started. So in a way, it also pokes fun at “hodlers” for not being able to understand when their ship is actually sinking. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:20:34
Don’t let Reddit be your only resource for conversation on crypto. There is a tendency for echo chambers to be developed, and much like assets, it’s best to diversify.
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:39:12
It’ll be okay, man. It was just a joke. The market has turned from $21,000 to $9,000 and to a lot of people that looks like a sinking ship. It all depends on where your investment began. If you wanted to, you could say that it has matured from 25 cents to $21,000, but it’s not important information concerning the future of an investment. I’m not a finance major, I’m just a welder from Ohio so I won’t claim to know what’s what. I only have very small holdings in LTC and ETH, for the fun of it. 
Don’t take it too personally, we’re all having fun.
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:26:04
I’m afraid I don’t understand where this lies with the analogy haha. To prevent downward market fluctuation I would have to have a pretty massive stake in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-22 05:51:34
Theories generally have more merit than guesses, is their point.
@_date: 2018-10-25 19:16:19
You’re the one that initially criticized someone for how they spend their day, man. You’re sounding more and more like a high schooler.
@_date: 2018-10-25 17:19:49
No, you also come here to argue with people you think are ignorant 16 yr olds because your self-virtue doesn’t allow you to not have the last word.
@_date: 2018-10-25 21:36:20
When did I say I do that? Do you feel wrong realizing you’re talking to a different person now?

This happens when you do structural maintenance repairs only where you “need it” instead of doing full building repair. You have reinforced beams holding up one side of the building and the other side ready to crumble.
@_date: 2019-02-05 03:07:53
That’s why I’m not sure why people are saying this will poorly reflect on crypto. If anything it should get people to understand that if you don’t own the keys, you don’t own the currency.
@_date: 2019-02-05 12:38:41
“Bitcoin bank” hahahah
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:32:22
I mean, I’m paid below average my in field too.
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:50:01
It’s jarring that you understand that the beginning is where you bought in, but not that the end is where you sell. You don’t lose money until you sell for a loss. Until then, your chart has no end.
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:35:12
I could find a new job, but if I wanted to do that I’d just do it. I just mean it’s a matter of either finding compromise or changing gears. Also as a welder, the average pay is pretty high to begin with.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:13:58
Don’t. Let those feelings sit on the back burner for a year. Then re-assess them.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:35:05
Still proven to be goddamn dumb.
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:21:10
So? All my crypto is bought through coinbase. I’d say 90% of the new money that came in the past two months keeps their money on coinbase, the minority being the ones who use wallets. Exposure is good, don’t discredit a man for being new to something, even willing to educate himself and others on the subject.
