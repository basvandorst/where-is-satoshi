Unless you average the prices over the last year, this stat means nothing.

What bitcoin remittance services operate between the US and Argentina?

The ignorance is strong with this one. Absolute shit journalism.

Probably shouldn't use the 2013 dates... Use the more recent ones instead.

So let me know if I understood him correctly.
From an engineering perspective, it is impossible to maintain scalability, privacy, and low fees all at the same time. 
At least, it seems impossible using bitcoin as the base layer.
Is it really impossible? Will the need to have all 3 - scalability, privacy, and low fees - together lead to the development of a cryptocurrency that can deliver them all? How do we really know if it is impossible?
Perhaps this technology has already been invented? Iota, Monero, something else? Maybe it doesn't exist yet. Maybe it can't exist.
Innovation happens when people choose not to settle for what already exists. That's how bitcoin came to be. 
Is off-chain scaling the most satisfying solution? Is there something better that even Andreas has not conceived of? Does that solution even involve bitcoin?
Whoever knows the answers to these questions will be very rich someday. :)

I think they should burn that money (or delete it) so that the possibility of that currency causing massive inflation is gone, which is the least they can do to provide restitution to the people who were stolen from in the first place to provide the bailouts.

Definitely some users in the Chicago area. I know New Hampshire has many as well.

It is precisely this attitude that will give rise to a more competitive cryprocurrency. If bitcoin does not continuously improve, it will be replaced.

I don't really care about the amount of code. I care about the utility of the currency. People don't choose to use a currency based on how long the developers worked on it. They use a currency because of its features. Fast confirmation time, transparency (or privacy), immutability, ease of use, low/no fee transactions, etc. Bitcoin has to serve the needs of its users, or those people will find a crypto that serves their needs better.

Not to mention less code is more easily audited.

If you want to inscribe your keys onto a metal plate, you should do it manually. If you use a laser engraver or CNC, your keys will be recorded in the respective software / device thus compromising your security.

Can you describe what makes a republic more representative than direct democracy? If direct democracy is the majority imposing on the minority, is not a republic the minority (a group of politicians) imposing on the majority?

So when a politician enacts a law, is he not imposing that law on all those who did not vote for him?
@_date: 2015-10-29 21:01:02
You can definitely buy votes even if they're not attached to a specific name afterwards. Everyone who has a vote can be bought.
The purpose of bitcoin is to make trusting 3rd parties obsolete. When you vote anonymously, you must trust whoever is counting. I'd rather not give anyone that sort of power.
