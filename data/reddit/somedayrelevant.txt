With the release of Nvidia's 900M series, the performance gap between desktop and laptop gaming is shrinking more and more. Laptops will always be more expensive than desktops with price:performance ratios, but your dollar will buy significantly more performance in a mobile gaming platform than it would even just five years ago. FWIW, I do fit into your exception (military) and I haven't regretted my purchase of a gaming-grade laptop 5.5 years ago. It's only now beginning not to be able to run *some* of the most recent games.
Here is a very decent gaming laptop for $1,834:

I don't know where you live, but [USAA Deposit Taking ATMs exist]( Check the link for locations.
The company also operates Financial Centers in [Annapolis, MD; Arlington, VA; Clarksville, TN; Colorado Springs, CO; Columbus, GA; El Paso, TX; Fayetteville, NC; Highland Falls, NY; Jacksonville, NC; Junction City, KS; Killeen, TX; Oceanside, CA; San Antonio, TX; San Diego, CA; Virginia Beach, VA; and Washington, D.C.]( where you can do anything you can do at any other bank.

Not so surprising as they [have operations centers in London and Frankfurt]( They also seem to advertise heavily on cable channels.

It is a Clevo/Sager NP8258. You can find it direct from Sager [here]( or through XOTIC PC [here]( (no endorsement implied, I just like some of their customization options).
There are all kinds of models you can customize on Sager's site. I suggest checking it out if you are in the market. Xoticpc.com also has some neat customization features such as upgrading to copper cooling pipes, and removing any branding from the laptop among other things.

I've never seen a bank charge its own customers an ATM fee in the U.S. A fee is charged only for using a different bank's ATM or one outside of your bank's corporative network in my experience throughout the country.

4.95%?? No, I missed that. I did lock in two military appreciation CDs at 3.5% APY though.

How would you get cash back if you are scammed?

I get the feeling that you are being facetious, but I'll answer anyway. They have them there to ease the process of claims for U.S. service members stationed abroad.

Right. Why let the NSA spy on you when you can have China do it instead?

It's worth noting that it's 2.96% *APR* or 3.00% APY with a maximum deposit of only $3000 and with a limit of one CD per member. So, you earn $90 after 12 months.

As far as you know...

*Most* geeks don't run antivirus software? Since when? Why would one choose not to run antivirus on a system that isn't a honeypot?
Edit: Or were you referring to not running av on a dedicated mining rig? That could make sense.

I read this sentiment a lot on reddit, but I just don't understand it. Even if you are 100% perfect in your computing habits, the bad guys can still compromise your computer. You don't even have to be targeted for these attacks. Going to a seemingly innocuous site like speedtest.net could [exploit your computer]( with a 0-day vulnerabitly. This isn't even an isolated incident. Most online security threats [are from legitimate websites]( Having software like EMET, SELinux, and AV installed significantly reduces the success of these attacks.
The goal of most hackers, excepting ransomware authors and distributors, is not to be discovered. If you were infected, you likely wouldn't discover it because even massive corporations with dedicated computer security employees [take over 200 days to discover an intrusion]( [PDF WARNING] (page 1, paragraph 1 of Introduction), oftentimes only after being notified by an outside entity.
The adage of "common sense is the best AV" is terrible advice in my opinion. Yes, common sense will make it more difficult for a skiddie to pwn your box with 1337 hax, but in today's world with professional criminals it is not enough. Furthermore, computing power is so much more for so much less money these days that are you really going to miss those few dozen MB of RAM or cycles from your CPU?

I disagree that there's zero benefit. The few places I've been to that actually do have chip readers *require* inserting the chip. If you swipe a chipped card there, the reader will tell you to insert the chip or it won't process the transaction. A magnetic strip can be duplicated, but a chip cannot be faked (for now anyway).
However, I do agree that if the actual physical card is stolen and not just the numbers on it, the chip does nothing to secure the transaction without a PIN. A person is likely to notice a missing card though, but a person might not know their card was skimmed before it's used in a fraudulent transaction.

Language is a fluid, ever-changing thing. Dictionaries are derived from the language, not the other way around. Urbandictionary is even [used in court cases]( to help determine the actual meaning of slang terms.
