Every ranged weapon with any degree of accuracy begs to differ. The only thing you're able to maintain is the illusion of security, which is what we refer to as being a "tough guy".


Most of us have realized security is a joke by now.

Plus the fact that is was probably compacted, tossed around, etc.
The data may very well be recoverable, but there's a high chance it's dead.

Maybe that's the way it is down in the states, but we had an investigation up here because someone ran the plates of a car with a "cute chick" in it that wasn't speeding or anything. The guy formally apologized and charges weren't pressed, but he was very close to losing his job.
Can confirm, "cute chick" was my mom &gt;.&gt;
This whole thread is crazy town. Is it seriously *that* bad down there?

*You* do, Europeans may and Canadians probably will because they have exposure. I'd wager most Americans don't, and that's the main audience on reddit.

Even selling at what it is right now would've been roughly 830k CAD.
Had I sold when it was 20k+ I would've had 2.4 million. From $30.
It stings a little.

You're being downvoted because you missed the point. "If you're going to make a statement, inform yourself"
This information is freely available online, being lazy is not an acceptable excuse for being incorrect.

I had $30 of it in my cart when it was 25 cents per bitcoin. All my information was entered. All I had to do was hit buy, and it would've been sent to a personal wallet.
I could've been a millionaire off $30. Pretty sure I subbed here out of masochism more than anything.
@_date: 2019-04-29 23:45:58
See, but I'm a lazy shit with a short attention span.
I didn't pay attention to bitcoin again until it was at $200 and making headlines. I might've sold then, admittedly. But I tend to hold onto investments.
I don't think having bitcoin would've made me pay attention, because I've had $2k invested in a bank and haven't looked at it in two years.
I very much would have sold once I started seeing millions in returns, but I don't know how badly I would have jumped the shark.
I just tell myself I would have sold early to avoid the crushing despair when I imagine retiring at 25.

Well, if sources were open as well they'd run out awfully quick. 
Whatever your opinion of the current administration, the US government as a whole is pretty good on an international scale, and they've treated legitimate whisleblowers (IE: Snowden) with abject hostility. Any "bad" government would take a more permanent route to silence sources.
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:44:16
Yep, and that's a totally fair label. I'm sure Russia, and specifically Putin, have quite a number of skeletons in their closet, both real and metaphorical.
I was only pointing out why Wikileaks (and any future organization of a similar nature) won't reveal their sources. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 08:07:35
Well then, now I feel like a jerk for wording that so aggressively. Stop being so reasonable and stuff! :P
Edit: sorry!

Sometimes it's necessary and a good idea.
Most of the time it just makes everybody's lives harder. Nobody likes a rules lawyer, particularly if they haven't even bothered to read all the rules first...
@_date: 2015-09-29 18:10:31
It's entirely reasonable to reappropriate assets gained through illegal means. If I stole a million dollars, bought a house, and we didn't have these laws, all they could legally do is give me jail time and ask for me to give the money back.
These laws were designed to protect everyone from generally shitty people. They come at a cost - specifically, making loans a bit of a pita - but in general they're a good thing.
Also I was referring to being reasonable, not the laws.

Probably not, as they'd also be forced to keep clients that don't make them money.

Well evidently you haven't learned much in that time. :/

Since drug dealers and other illicit means of obtaining money can cause them to lose the house to the feds and have their borrower and the borrowers assets incarcerated/seized.

This is the thing about reddit though, I don't have adblock on this computer and I only see two ads to other subreddits, neither of which make noise or anything obnoxious.

It's not *simply* that they lost a court case. They were blatantly misreporting, got caught, and now their bank doesn't wish to associate with them anymore.
If you had a client that turned out to be the Westboro baptist church (or planned parenthood, depending on which side of that fence you're on) who was printing things that blatantly misrepresented your side of the choice/life argument to make you seem like a monster, would you continue doing business with them or part ways?
I would personally part ways, particularly if they're putting my relationship with a far larger (and more profitable) client at risk. It's both an ethical choice and a smart business choice.

Think of it this way - OP had to spend time and effort to notify the company and get the bitcoins back to their proper owner. There's also the mental aspect of having to "lose" $17k, even though it wasn't really his. People underestimate the mental aspect - even if you know it's not yours, subconsciously you'll likely start thinking about things you could buy or fix with that capital.
If someone comes across a lost dog and tries to return it, they're spending time and effort to look after the dog and call the owner.
If your neighbor lets you borrow his tools, you're putting wear and tear on his tools, and taking up a bit of their time.
If your brother lets you borrow his car, same thing - you're putting wear and tear on it, even if you are chipping in your fair share for gas. Also don't leave food containers and half full drinks in it. I uhh... may be speaking from experience on that one. I have two sisters - One I would have zero reservations about lending my car to as she washes and cleans it when she's done, and one I probably would not lend my car or possessions to as there's no "fair trade". I get more miles put on my car and have to clean it out... yay.
Rewarding someone for a good deed is a combination of compensation for time and effort, and encouraging good deeds. All *healthy* relationships in life are give and take in equal measure. The reward doesn't necessarily need to be monetary depending on the relationship - in this case, with the parties being in a business relationship, monetary makes sense. Friends might get each other snacks, or have them over for dinner. Hell, it doesn't even have to be instant! My friends and I take turns buying snacks for our gaming parties.
