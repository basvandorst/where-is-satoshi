Throw my kids in the sewer?  I mean that's not a bad idea.

r/bitcoin used to be a cool sub years ago talking about new ideas, now it's just yahoo finance.

Nice story brah

I came here to watch an iPhone get shot.  Was not disappointed.
@_date: 2014-08-09 15:52:55
Is this why imgur has been down so much lately?
@_date: 2019-11-02 03:33:53
The tech really isn't all that impressive.
@_date: 2019-11-02 03:36:38
Shit is old tech.  The ppl who think encryption is cool tech are the same as those who still think digital watches are cool.
@_date: 2019-10-16 20:03:20
Anyone who ever bought illegal drugs online with bitcoin is now having a collective butt clinch.  Forever recorded in the blockchain.

If I could get 100x leverage on something I would already be rich.

@_date: 2018-11-24 22:58:41
Might as well just remove the tooth at this point.  You waited too long to drill it and now it's infected and needs a root canal.  That's expensive.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:15:49
Such a precious day.
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:11:24
You have tunnel vision.  It's not all about BTC.  Everything is connected.  All markets are crashing and BTC isn't immune to that.  As the stock markets gets crushed, investors liquidate their assets to cover those losses and bitcoin is on the block at that point.  In fact brokers will liquidate customer assets whether they like or not due to margin calls.  Welcome to the big time.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:18:21
All currently shitting the bed.  Everything is crashing.  Including hooker and blow rates.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:01:13
It's called a rout.  So many sell orders are being placed the system can't handle it so they pick the most important connections to service.  You being a little peon and not a big fat cat are likely way down the list.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:50:10
Gotta wonder how the exchanges will stay in business at that point.  
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:13:28
not aging well is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:58:40
Hah I see what you did.  I'd have to pay your fees to get your bitcoin.  Brilliant!
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:18:45
This is the time when bitcoin evangelists finally learn that the price of bitcoin is tied to the stock market.

I think the moon is coming to us.

It's reputation has been ruined by all the pump and dumps.  No way ppl use this for a currency now other than buying an 8-ball off a tor node.
@_date: 2018-11-21 08:15:56
So basically BTC is way overpriced due leveraged purchases.  Thx for clearing that up.
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:21:20
LOL @ the node.js community
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:58:04
Fees make it go below zero.
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:13:11
Hundreds of billions of dollars worth above 10K.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:03:08
And what is that commission based off of?  
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:41:29
Nice story brah
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:56:56
And they'll be making a lot less when the price falls and there are less trades.   So much less that they start laying people off.  And then the leveraged positions they had suddenly come to call.  Happens with every bear market.  Exchanges get crushed when the price of the commodity drops.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:28:51
Did you get his bitcoin wallet pw?
@_date: 2019-01-06 00:12:01


More likely BTC propaganda on sites like reddit but so much easier to blame "the media" right?

Best meltdown thread of the year so far.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:53:13
The bottom is less than zero.   Fees, margin, leveraged debt.  All follows.

This is good for the bus.

When is the last time a banker went to prison in America?
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:22:17
Pretty clever code. Looks like it's been infecting BTC wallets for a while.  Wonder if ppl who got their btc stolen even realize it's been stolen yet?
@_date: 2018-11-24 04:55:42
ahh so it's good for illegal stuff.  gotcha.

None of this comment makes any sense at all.  
Specifically this paradox


I mean wat is going on in your brain???
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:01:30


@_date: 2018-11-19 17:39:10
Because we're starting to see real market crashes.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:05:49
Shorters are happy doing so.
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:14:54
Just dropped below 8k
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:23:11
Having trouble determining if these are troll posts or someone really believes this.

*uh ok I guess you passed.*   ---Gandalf probably
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:59:31
So do we just reverse the memes as it drops back to $800?
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:09:11
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:17:32
This troll never gets old.  :)
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:43:04
Oops CNBC doesn't show the price of bitcoin bug anymore.  Cmon dumb dumbs.  Follow your own advice.  Puke on your shoes and buy more heh.
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:29:26
What about the memes?
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:54:33
Right they get a percentage of the trade.  It's based on the price of the trade. When the price falls they make less.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:02:02
Best subredit today.

Cash?  What's that? I though we were supposed to just have bitcoin now?
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:11:39
It's recovering to $800
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:58:44
Backwards down the meme line.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:49:03
It's going the wrong direction.  Does it wrap around at zero?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:03:24
Hah jokes on you I'm just waiting for it to form a smooth 
 solid immovable and unbreakable base upon which I will build my Mansion on and park my Lambo.

So SODL!

Well they're just 40 yo kids.   It's a good life lesson for those lil rascals.

Who had $6500 in the pool because that's a hit as of now.

I'm pretty sure you don't know how leverage works.

I'm going to wait for 0 so I can get them for free.  Minus a fee of course.
