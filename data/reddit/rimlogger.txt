Classic bubble mentality. Several months ago, many of my friends didn't even know what crytocurrency and Bitcoin were or only heard about it briefly in the news. Some of them went all-in, buying Bitcoin off Coinbase with their savings. They are likely going to sell and realize the losses when they realize that it's not going to keep going up perpetually. Selling begets selling. I believe that the price will stay above $10,000 but who knows.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:24:57
Coming back now. Above $11,000.

They don't care. Most merchants convert to USD as soon as possible and some have purchased hedging instruments from banks to hedge against any possible fluctuations. Accepting Bitcoin is just a way of getting some attention in the tech media.

0% at the moment. At one point, way back, I had like 0.05 bitcoins in 2011, which constituted around 1% of my net worth (I was a college student then and didn't have much money).

I doubt it will go under $200 like it did a few years back. Eventually people are going to buy back in. I think buying in at $1,000 (if it goes there) is a good inflection point. This is just a bump in the road.

And yet the same sort of centralization has already happened with Bitcoin - thanks to the Chinese. They are holding you hostage because they control all the hashing power - at least with ASIC-resistant coins like Ethereum (which will be moving to a proof of stake model in the near future), there will always be enough room for a layman to control a few nodes without resorting to pricey hardware that eventually goes obsolete. 
Face it up - Bitcoin may be the OG coin, but it did develop flaws that Satoshi did not imagine happening until it scaled up.

Enjoy your slow confirmation times and constant upheaval and forks. At this point, Bitcoin isn't even really used for commerce, lots of darknet markets are adding support for Zcash and Monero now, which have better features for certain kinds of commerce than Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is mostly used as a vehicle for speculation by the Chinese right now. At least ETH control is based out of a Western country, and they are pretty transparent about everything (read their blog!)
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:19:15
Yep. The Chinese and the mining community have no incentive to give users what they want, it's either their way or a hard fork. No one wants a hard fork, so the Chinese are calling Bitcoin Core's bluff at that one.
The miners have all the power here. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:24:07
Today? Nothing. But down the road, if it's a hard fork you are going to have to decide which chain your coins are going to travel. And Bitcoin will plummet in price accordingly.
Though given the inertia from all sides of the aisle on this debate I think that a hard fork is still over a year away. No one wants to kill the golden goose just yet.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:51:24
Unlike 2013, we got some real alternatives now (and that are not Litecoin). Zcash. Monero. Ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:24:39
What card or equipment do you have? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:15:03
Don't 95% of the nodes need to approve first? I mean the Chinese can still force a fork and go on their own.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:42:58
I remember when confirmations on BTC took mere seconds. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:09:24
Then why hasn't Segwit happened yet, if it was just that easy? I know the solution has been proposed for nearly two years now.
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:34:14
I think the miners are just calling Bitcoin Core's bluff, and visa versa. A hard fork would be detrimental for both sides. 
For now, slow confirmations will be the order of the day. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:55:53
 
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:20:54
In short, miners want to make more money confirming transactions. Users want low fees.
There are solutions to the slow confirmation times but miners and users cannot agree on which solution.
Therein lies the controversy. No one wants a hard fork but I think it will happen eventually or else Bitcoin loses its commercial usefulness and the price collapses again like it did a few years ago.
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:10:19
Miners fear giving up their power over the network. No one wants to budge. Everyone is kicking the can down the road until a hard fork develops. Chinese want to delay Segwit for as long as possible. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:18:17
ETH already had its fork. It's called ETC. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:48:41
I'm thinking that there's going to be a fork, one way or another. There will be a decentralized fork, dominated by people who want to use Bitcoin for daily use and not be encumbered by high fees and slow confirmation times, and then a more centralized one, controlled by the Chinese.
Eventually, on the decentralized fork, the controversy will stir up again when some people gain enough hashing power on the network to force yet another split between the centralized and decentralized factions. 
Personally, if you want to use crypto in commerce, I would recommend looking at stuff like Monero or Zcash instead. Lots of darknet markets are starting to add support for stuff besides Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:37:59
ETH miner here.
I've spent the past few hours reading about the Jihan Wu/Segwit/UASF controversy. 
With ETH, we had our fork ages ago. It's called ETC. 
Personally, with regards to cryptocurrencies, I'm generally in favor of centralization so long as the people at the top know what they are doing, as in the case of ETH. 
I dumped my BTC several years ago and started mining ETH recently. I'm far more bullish on ETH right now, mostly because it's modestly inflationary and somewhat centralized (at least until the next fork, but whatever the Ethereum Foundation goes with will always the "canon Ethereum", so to speak).
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:52:59
Eh some people don't care. I know I don't. I rather have my 1.5% back letting someone know I ate McDonald's that morning. What are they going to do, call me fat?
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:25:40
Miners are on Users here. 
I have no skin in the game but I believe there are merits in both solutions proposed for the slow confirmations issue.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:45:10
I think so, but again, causation doesn't imply correlation. Personally, since most cryptocurrencies are highly correlated with one another (they are derivatives of one another, many of them), I believe that the rise in the ETH price caused the rise in the Bitcoin price, not the other way around.
Most mainstream people have only heard about Bitcoin. When ETH prices started rising, Bitcoin went up along with it. Along the way, this caught mainstream media attention, which encouraged mainstream speculators to jump into Bitcoin, and then ETH, when they started hearing about that. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:40:36
I would advise that you move to ETH. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:00:13
Unfortunately, I am indeed an Ethereum shill. Mostly a miner, but I think Ethereum is better for commerce as there is a central authority that can push consensus. Bitcoin has no consensus, just tension between all the major players that don't want to get along. 
Bitcoin is not useful for commerce right now. Go on people are complaining about how their transactions are not going through.
In order for Bitcoin to have value, it must have valid applications outside being a novelty collection of private keys and public keys. 
Until that changes, it will mostly be used for speculation and the price of Bitcoin in fiat will crash any moment the "normies" start hearing about the current controversy in Bitcoin. There are many other better coins out there for commerce right now, like Monero, Zcash, etc. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:30:15
Speculation from normies who don't know shit about it. Check out the GBTC ETF right now. It's worth more than the Bitcoin currently in it!
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:36:56
Why does the value between fiat and Bitcoin matter? Should Bitcoiners be eschewing fiat? Shouldn't Bitcoin stand on its own, instead of being mirrored with fiat all the time? Or are you just another speculator?
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:57:25
Yes. He's no hero, but I'll grant him status as an innovator in the dark net market space and making Bitcoin mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:26:03
That's ridiculous. Visa and banks charge a 3% to 4% fee at most for merchants, while Bitcoin miners are charging like 10%. It is no longer worth it send Bitcoin in small amounts anymore. How is that reasonable or sustainable for commerce right now?
I am aware that the community is working out a solution, though.

I think Ulbricht was more motivated by the money he could make safely while drug dealing. He did sell a bunch of mushrooms to make his first buck off the site after all.
That said, a life sentence is a travesty. He should be been sentenced 30 or 40 years, but not life.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:28:52
Oh right, like how they say people won't stop buying IBM. The altcoins are eating Bitcoin for lunch right now.
And yeah, I agree that many ICOs on Ethereum are a scam, but again I'm just a miner. But I think they will solve their teething pains better than Bitcoin can.
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:58:28
I did hear that he discussed a plea deal with the government. The government told him that the best he could be given was 10 years to life, at the discretion of the judge. So he said no to any plea deal and decided to fight it out in court.
Of course he failed. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:52:18
So you are saying that you prefer Bitcoin to be a store of value rather than be useful for commerce?
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:56:03
It's hard to defend a client who has overwhelming evidence against him. Not even the best lawyers can bend the laws of physics or make evidence disappear. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:52:04
At least Monero still has fast confirmations. Bitcoin is shit for commerce right now.
