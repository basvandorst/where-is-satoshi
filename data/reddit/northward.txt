Personally, I think the rise will continue. But, the influx of newcomers buying in at a volatile period may not have the confidence to keep from pulling their money out should some completely unforeseen event negatively affect prices. These kind of events have happened and could happen in the future. The only predictable thing about bitcoin long-term is how unpredictable it is, therefore I don't think I could give any "reason" that the OP might be looking for.  That said, if a person has the right attitude and fully accepts that they could lose most of their investment, then there isn't a reason not to go in. I think if a person investing long-term places more value on gaining knowledge and experience along the way, they'll come out ahead regardless of whether bitcoin rises or crashes.

For me it's been about learning. Over the past year, thanks to getting involved in Bitcoin, I've learned so much about investing, currency, people, world events, pc/network security...the list goes on.  Using Bitcoin has given me a desire to learn about so many things that I previously had little interest in. I'm in it to watch, experiment, and help people I know get involved in hopes that it sparks their interest in learning not only about cryptocurrencies, but much broader subjects as well.

I think you're getting downvotes because you're making a pretty bold claim with very little explanation. I think an explanation of what you found, how you found it, and what should be done would be very helpful to a lot of people.

If your sole reason is to make a quick buck, no. If there's products, services, or other short-term uses you'd like to take advantage of, yes. If you're wanting to buy and hold, I don't think anyone can give an answer with any certainty.

Sorry, I wish I could. I made it about 3 pages into the comments before I had to close it. I'd love to help educate people, but trying to do it on there would be like pissing into an ocean of piss.

Fuck you, Number Munchers was the shit.

I agree, but the thing I fear about it would be all the negative press and the cries of "scam!" from the ones who cut and run. People like that tend to get angry and blame anything but themselves when it comes to losing money.

Watching the charts is definitely more entertaining than anything that's on cable/satellite TV.

Sounds like you learned a lesson. If you want to dabble in short-term or day trading, allocate a small percentage of your coins to do so. If you're so scared about losing your money that you sell just because of a $15 drop, you haven't been listening to the people on this subreddit who are constantly saying not to invest more than you're willing to lose.

The one thing I haven't been able to understand about this sort of perspective...even if the worst did happen and and the US government somehow shut down USD/BTC trading, I don't see how that would affect large foreign markets to the point of bitcoin being completely worthless. It would certainly take a while to recover, but bitcoin is global, new exchanges would pop-up, and the advantages of using it wouldn't really change.
