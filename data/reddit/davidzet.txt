I think the author is missing something, i.e., jurisdiction arbitrage.

I sold 2 coin @ $1,140 a few days ago.
THEN I was talking up BTC as "the future," which I think is true (What was I thinking!)
Just bought 2 coin back @ $1,100. That's my "dip profit"
Coinbase is STRESSED.

...and then there's marginal cost pricing, as in "sell every btc at a price higher than you paid for it." 
DCA might fool you into thinking that selling 2 coins (cost $300 and $500) for $450 is a good idea.

Just mil or mils the same way we say cents. Example: How many mils for that pizza? 2? Ok...

I agree with your critique on coiners. Banks, OTOH, are not going to leave money on the table without that regulation which was PART of a policy of forcing them to compete -- just as we're seeing with the soon-to-be ended policy on data roaming.

I agree that SEPA transfers are great but the EU forced them to zero fees via common market regulations. It wasn't the banks' idea to do free ;)

Yeah. That's a shit article (zerohedge) that has no idea. $/€ swaps are too easy. The embargoes don't depend on currency either. 
@_date: 2016-09-09 08:24:47
I'm guessing that ING will follow if ABN makes money (or good publicity). In the meanwhile, there are still lots of bitcoin opportunities :)
(Oh, and how much will ABN charge? That may be a deal breaker...)

Did you read the article? It didn't even use the world socialist, and its more about decentralized systems. Seems like you just want to bash socialists (not that they don't deserve a little).

Better to get amazon credit without fee than cash.
Edit: I’m referring to coins to cash. I had no idea coinstar does crypto/fiat. Amazing.

Serious: Sounds like we need an image that’s bitcoin without the coininess. Something that’s more digital?
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:39:46
Great answer. You got at my "feeling" with the Indian example. Expanding, it seems that the commodity value will be higher/lower in places where BTC is more/less helpful compared to the local currency. Thus, I'd say that the fiat/btc gap can be used as an indicator of central bank (political) distortion. (I may look into this, as a research project :)

It's trustless for a reason... or did you forget the /s?
@_date: 2017-06-30 21:07:37
Nope. I think there may be a discussion of energy consumption when the BTC blockchain consumption gets into the top 50 in the world (vs countries) -- which may also mean that PoW ends up being limited by energy capacity, not cost...
@_date: 2017-06-12 06:00:16
That's why inflation is divided into "monetary" and "demand driven" -- to separate the accounting from the real economy
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:24:48
Ahhh... no. They use Thai baht or USD (when they get $50 worth of savings, which is not often). BTC doesn't have to work for 7+ billion people *right now*. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:36:16
Quick side question: The *length* of the word matters (a) only to 4 characters or (b) to X characters? If (a), then the words in the 2000 word dictionary are only "different" in their first 4 letters, right?
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:18:43
Hmmm. But the word has to be longer than *n* letters to map to a 4-digit number, yes? What's *n*? 4? 6?
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:38:30
My question exactly. In fact, I'd love to know how (1) hotwallets (e.g., Coinbase), (2) software wallets (e.g., electrum), and cold stores/paper wallets (e.g., bitaddress.org generated) will be affected if they are holding BTC on 1 August...
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:46:11
Yeah, it's really sad. I come to this "topic" from the Drug Wars. He was framed on the murders... (IMO)
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:13:50
0.001 btc ($2-3) to transfer is not insane... unless you're buying coffee. I think it's fine when you're shifting 1, 5, 50 coins. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:09:26
Exchanges may be operating like ponzi schemes in the short run by selling or buying at aggressive prices that only work while users store coins w them AND prices are rising (d&gt;s)
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:02:33
[as I said above...] btc could be GREAT in fast, cheap transfers as digital gold has a big value that would complement eth. So btc needn't lose if eth works. (I worry a bit more about a central bank hack killing btc .)
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:18:09
If they get seriously hacked then I doubt the insurer will pay... unless coinbases premiums are ALSO rising by 100% per month. Worth looking into before you trust them (remember AIG?)
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:30:42
Excellent, simple answer. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:33:09
This is a great point (and I am indeed choosing my words). Thus, Using "Mary had a little lamb [etc]" for my pass phrase would be a silly idea, BUT using random words [that never appear in that order in the wild] would be much more secure, right? 
In fact, maybe even MORE secure if you were taking them from a 20,000 word dictionary, right?
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:08:03
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:14:12
Great analysis. You're right about private banks. That's why the gold standard was valued. Luckily btc is a version of gold, to keep the good exchanges honest. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:05:56
Wow. Thanks. That's more math than I'm used to, but I totally understand what you mean (more letters good but not necessarily after the minimum *log equivalent* of 2.34 ;)
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:17:22
Cool. Then they probably apply ;)
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:56:56
[FFS. I just lost a long reply. Try again...] I'm an economist and he makes sense, in that btc may not be  for long and would lose value BUT btc could be GREAT in fast, cheap transfers as digital gold has a big value that would complement eth. So btc needn't lose if eth works. (I worry a bit more about a central bank hack killing btc .)
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:41:09
nobody really knows what will happen. Thus, diversify over time (and perhaps across currencies). There are many fanboys for various tech/coins on reddit, but their words don't usually predict well.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:14:09
I heard about BTC in 2009 or so. I downloaded "a mining program" (no idea of the name) and couldn't get it to work. Gave up. Only got back in in 2013 or so. 
As an economist, I am extremely excited about crypto the technology, but also extremely worried about the 5D-game theory that's being put to the test now (everything from Segwit to wallets and seeds and ICOs), so it's still a brave new world with risks that are going to be making news for a few years yet.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:58:01
Well, I see your point, BUT we know that there are BIG purchases and SMALL purchases (e.g., home vs coffee) and thus better instruments for each. BTC may not be the solution for buying coffee.
@_date: 2017-06-11 09:32:16
Good point, but how are governments (trying to) regulating BTC? Are you talking about Japan making it legal, for example? In most cases, I am pretty sure most people will avoid regulation (going underground), and that's easier with BTC than for, say, buying or selling a car...
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:23:06
Yes, I know there's arbitrage (a-bit-rage? :), but I was unclear of how transaction costs vary from one exchange to another. You've pointed out a few, but is there any statistical analysis/data showing how TCs and exchange rates move together?
